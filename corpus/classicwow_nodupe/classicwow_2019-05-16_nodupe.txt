Ok thanks, so after they turn it off its just as vanilla? It's just for phase 1?
---
---
---
My *guess* is that it's different crowds of folks being vocal at different times, but still funny :p
---
This would literally be the worst time for them to do something like that. I have played in other betas and never got anything for it, if they did it for Vanilla beta, wouldn't go over well #noChanges
---
It‚Äôs way too high and damage is way too low but w/e ‚Äúeverything is fine‚Äù
---
Yeah.  I also dont have 19 other competent friends to jump into a mythic level raid.  I'm not good enough to compete in high level pvp.   I don't take the game seriously enough to push high mythic plus keys.  Extending to other games, I'm not interested in practicing a game to play with a team competitively.
---

---
There's certain activities that are just the same as 'not having 20 friends available at the same time let along the equipment or field' in gaming.  This content is either not available to me or I'm just not good enough to access it.  But it's still interesting to experience.  Plus esports can be really fun to watch if you understand the game in the same way sports can be fun to watch.
---
&gt; If they played back in Classic, that doesn‚Äôt do Blizzard any good at all. People who played then already know how that game should function, as well as does Blizzard. What benefit would Blizzard possibly get from inviting someone who hasn‚Äôt played in a long time to the beta of a game they already know?
---
That makes no sense lol.  Blizzard has said the purpose of the beta is to make sure that they got classic "right" and to squash any bugs found.  People that played vanilla are exactly the type of people they want specifically because they know how it should be.
---
My example was hypothetical as well. The point I've stuck to, consistently, without goalpost moving whatsoever, is that Layering will affect the economy, and could have the potential for doing so in a very negative way as OP pointed out.
---
The analogy was to try and make it more simple to grasp the point about competition bottlenecking, which is instrumental to my argument. You may understand the concept finally, as it seems to be the case, but now you're speculating that it won't be significant which is in and of itself is goalpost moving from "no it won't" to "yes but not that bad". The original comment poster I replied to is still completely oblivious to the logic entirely.
---
Ok, not so bad then, thanks :)
---
Ah, so you were here *just* to be toxic.  Understood.  Blocked and moving on.
---
Druid has like literally no mana at low level. It will look like higher % for regen but you would have to look at the actual numbers. Iirc druid could cast 2 wraths and be oom.
---
Lets not be this hostile against eachother? I totally understand that people have different viewpoints about the game. I do however still think that this will be the best mmorpg out even with these changes.
---
Layering is just a temporary solution, hopefully it gets removed even before we hit p2.
---
I've not seen any issue with the mob damage.  Cross checking using the bestiary and it seems fine, at least in starting zones.
---
Regen is way off.
---

Bro calm down. I was saying it improves your odds not that it was gate keeping. So touchy.
---
Where did I say that?
---
This fucking sub. It's early testing, report the shit you "think" is wrong and if it is well it's up to Blizzard to fix it. If it's not fixed then you may have to admit you're wrong about what you remember. I know that's difficult for some of you, but it happens.
---
Blizzard have bad track records with recent betas (lul azerite gear) but this team sounds like they're on top of this shit.
---
Grats on life going in the right direction, don't take a wrong turn and get addicted to Classic :D
---
He's not getting dazed because he is jump kiting them. That is exactly how it was back in the day.
---
high capacity servers is one thing I'm not excited about, oh well
---
aware
---
thats the optimistic answer, the realistic answer would be that people try to use any kind of leverage of their arguments they can get without needing to actually prove it..
---
I‚Äôve organised a booster to do the hard yards for me so after they get me to 60 within a week I have 3 weeks off my fianc√© has to write up her thesis so it‚Äôs a win win for me :)
---
It's literally not a coincidence?
---
ITT: People taking the starter pack meme wayyyy too seriously.
---
Sodapoppin has been playing wow for years... and I believe he had 2 lvl 60 toons on nost before it shutdown.
---
that looks like no account at all or am i wrong?
---
It's a test not early access. Wait til August or get lucky. Sorry, bud.
---
And I get that, I tend to watch the competitive eSports as well, but to compare the average twitch steamer to sports would be like watching a little league game. Also, lot easier to find 19 people online to raid with (when you can access people literally across the world) than 19 people within a mile or two radius of you.
---
Unbearable, and a shitty accent.
---
ive been subbed on all 40 of my multibox accounts since the first friend and family alpha and I didn't get an invite /pout
---
Underestimated bot
---
Yeah everything is off
---
‚ÄúClassic‚Äù
---
Pretty much zero chance this happens for Classic WoW
---
One of the consequences is that Elementalist shamans with sufficient points in resto are raid-viable dps in 40 player content assuming the number of caster groups is greater than the number of restoration shamans you need. Yes, they are worse than a mage for damage, but they bring more dps than a pure resto shaman (which would be redundant), and more importantly they have totems.
---
i think thats the chief issue..
---
never.   
---
People plan their holidays, LANS, community events around it, there is NO WAY a game release get pushed early once it has an official release date....
---
&gt; cross realm bgs existed in vanilla.
---
&gt; 
---
They are different from retails. Vanilla had battlegroups, not cross-realm, that's false.
---
I always have to point this out.
---
Where is damage too low? I'm watching Joana's speedruns rn and so far it all looks normal.
---
Yes, and we all want to help test. Why, just because I want to play, does it mean I only want early access?
---
Smh, okay man. Can we agree on bringing PA cartoons back at least?
---
I have the same thought to be honest. I‚Äôll fully admit I‚Äôd also probably be a shill for blizzard if that meant getting preferentially treatment üòÇ
---
That spider rare clip is hilarious. Smacks it for like 30% of its hp with auto attack lmao
---
arent beta feedback forums made for that?
---
This is true, specifically of Tauren druid, since they have such a low int value to start with. The regen is 'fast' but that's because they have like 50 mana.
---
I love the wallpaper, but that gnome, like all gnomes, tarnishes the bigger picture
---
If you're dead set on showing 3 slivers, more realistic would be two of same size and one half size or smaller.
---
as anyone discussed what happens if a server doesn't drop significantly its pop? what happens if we have a mega server?
---
Regardless, I've pulled that many mobs on private and vanilla and I feel like he should be taking a bit more damage.
---
JULY 16 LETS GOOOO
---
The fact that you think just because you're a fan means you should be in? Yes.
---
Closed betas have always been like this. If you don't get in then you don't get in. This isn't the only wave of invites that will go out. Chill.
---
So what? Are you saying we should not discuss bugs?
---
Literally people were saying ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt complain we just want a date‚Äù like a few days ago and loving the office memes. Now it‚Äôs like the world is ending because the date wasn‚Äôt in July, is all I was saying. Haha, man didn‚Äôt mean to offend. I logged into to Bfa for like 5 seconds just didn‚Äôt seem interesting tbh.
---
I wanted to tell him it made no sense but I thought I should just try to explain my position. That statement really does make no sense whatsoever.
---
Esfand used to talk normal and be funny, now he talks like a TV presenter in front of 1 billion live viewers, its absolutely terrible.
---
Also: I havent played since vanilla and havent been following wow at all. - Hold up these dmg and regen numbers are completely off, it wasnt that easy for 12yo me
---
i did
---
&gt; There are hundreds of thousands of people who started in Classic‚Äôs original beta still subscribed today. 
---
I'm going to call bullshit on this. There were 125,000 accounts in WoW's open beta. I doubt that number increased somehow.
---
He also had a horde leveling guide that told you exactly how he did it, years before streaming was a thing.
---
"Beta"
---
not gonna lie, vanilla seems pretty hard boys
---
neither i play wow not watch it
---
Yeah mob damage seems low too i've noticed. 
---
I guess stuff like this is the point of a beta though
---
Some one not as lazy as me needs to compare mob damage to joanna's leveling video
---
So, I am not allowed to voice an opinion without you telling me that my opinion is wrong? Its just an opinion, a statement. In no way do I actually think they will change it. Just venting some frustration, thanks for the talk tho Dad, really helped
---
and tipsout.. this guy just stinks of shady car salesman..
---
It is literally just as realistic to have it full than at a certain percent how are you not understanding this.  The chance of it being anywhere from 1% to 100% is the exact same chance.  Quit being a twat
---
Thats not Unbreakable
---
...but how would they even realize it was profitable if people weren't doing things like asking them nonstop for it, and setting up private servers?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yeah, I get it, it's about the market, but my point is that there *is* a market for old school MMORPGs.  Classic WoW is a step in the right direction, but it's not acceptable where that's my most hardcore option, because it isn't very hardcore at all.
---
Classic fucking Summer
---
Yes blizzard will have to have a cap to the number of layers allowed and some sort of queue system starting as layers start reaching there max cap.
---
This will prevent players from simply stacking a single realm to such a degree that the long term population is overinflated.
---
Are you serious right now?
---
sorry, my comment wasnt serious because i implied that you actually dont have access to a working vanilla client. (pserver clients ARE NOT vanilla!)
---
Or, y'know, use the in-game bug reporter
---
Voicing an opinion and bitching are two different things. If you need this so bad I hear there are "alternative servers" you can try until August. ;)
---
this
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you wouldn‚Äôt? It is still very much fall. Why do you have it in your head that December is actually fall? Or most of September isn‚Äôt Summer? Blizzard didn‚Äôt say they it would be released during summer break. When your an adult out of college summer is until summer is over on the calendar.
---
Ion Hazzikostas is an adderall junkie. You couldnt change his mind about anything.
---
It's not that my example was hypothetical (that's probably the least relevant part of my statement), but that you were incorrect in calling it wrong and that your analogy (while quite good in and of itself) didn't actually help your argument there.
---
Not worth my time. Please watch your own video and use your brain and compare.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure it was sketchy. I‚Äôm just saying the only people truly affected were those who took the risk
---
Am I being super silly in this but... I like to imagine my character being somewhere in a dungeon, in a city etc and it making sense. So for me, I love tauren but I just dont picture them making sense anywhere in Lordaeron pretty much. Why do they care about Scarlet Monastery or Strat etc. 
---
On the other hand something like a dwarf or Human feels appropriate everywhere.
---
Sometimes you gotta be blunt with people when they say something completely wrong lol
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
People putting their expectations so high into any made up release date that wasn't official was their own fault.
---
Market research will have basic trends on how many people pick up a game and continue or stop playing it.
---
Putting a cap on number of allowed layers and queues will stop extreme populations from forming int he first place.
---
Well, this is reddit after all, so that wouldn't surprise me either.
---
 
---
Again, people don't understand what's happening here. We all know what Layering/Sharding is,what it does and why, we all know. No matter how many times you explain it in a crystal clear voice, there is STILL a problem.
---
Blizzard is sacrificing server communities for a better first experience so people are able to play a perfectly working game. When in reality, the people who wanted classic in the first place, know that server issues are to be expected or you'll have to wait for the quest npc to respawn or wait before quest mobs respawn.
---
"Oh but it's only in effect for the first phase." We only get 60 levels here folks, community begins as soon as you move out of the pile of players as soon as you join the server. The guy purposely tagging every mob even though he doesn't need it, ya we'll remember you later on. Or the guy who saved your butt from dying while trying to quest, we'll remember that fella, and I'll trade him some goodies when I see him later on down the road.
---
That stuff is gone with layering/sharding. All because blizzard is catering to a playerbase that didn't even know vanilla was ever a thing. I just find it completely fucked, that all those people put so much effort into getting blizzard to bring back classic realms......R E A L M S. To have it all fade away between layers of different instances for every server released.
---
It just makes me super freaking nervous. Waiting all this time just to hear blizzard mention the single most destructive technology to be greeting us soon as we connect to CLASSIC REALMS.
---
I just hope I am wrong.
---
(Oh and before anyone says "Why do you think this is for a certain playerbase? Who made you so freaking special?" None of this wouldn't of happened if it wasn't for a very dedicated community of gamers who CONTINUED to fight for this, year after year. So yea, again, it's fucked, because this should of been for that community and right off the get go, I feel like it's blizzard just selling another game.)
---
‚Ä¶.. God damn it. I want an AdamDay. This is bullshit! I want money and stuff for being an Adam!
---
Let them bitch about it, they are paying customers by your definition so they can do that, I agree that nothing will change though.
---
Dude the damage is perfectly fine. Jesus Christ this community is dumb and clearly never played vanilla.
---
alot of the people complaining about it dont seem to actually know how it works because theyre all comparing it to sharding, but if they knew how both of them worked theyd realize that layering isnt anything like it and isnt nearly as harmful. also expecting them to not have some sort of system like this was insane in the first place
---
Clap, thanks Dad
---
No one is going to make a post saying ‚Äúeverything is as going as expected, I am satisfied.‚Äù
---
IF I remember correctly, every race had different stat values in Vanilla, some races had less spirit (your regen stat early on). You are showing a comparison of a warlock who is human vs soddapoppin's Tauren druid.
---
I don't think these are very comparable.
---
Humans had high spirit/spirit passive and if you are referring to health regen (I know you aren't), he has a health regen buff in his armor passive as well.  
---
Vanilla was always about chugging water, its why mages are one of the fastest leveling classes because they don't need to buy it or ask for it when they go out to grind.
---
oof if you can't see the difference than I hope you have not received a beta invite as your lack of perception would provide for zero reliable feedback to the developers.
---
Cool, I'm sold.
---
Yeah because leaving the fate of the game in the hands of people who browse blizzard forums is a wonderful idea.
---
Never happening.
---
&gt; if you haven't spent any time thinking about the negatives of the system, or read any other dissenting opinions of the system, how exactly can you have an impartial opinion?
---
I was there for the release, and I've played through every xpac. Sharding isn't an ideal solution, but the vanilla set up was horse shit as well. It was technical restriction blizzard had in its conception, not a design choice, but there's no reason to practically content lock players because of other players.
---
If you have trouble getting involved with the community because of sharding, that's on you. If you're worth your salt, you would know that the biggest killer to interacting was lfg. What are you talking about simulating the economy? Does it say somewhere that layers are using disconnected auction houses? Can players within the same server on different layers not trade? There's 0 difference market wise if everyone on a server is in the same, or individual layers. You can group, trade, talk, everything, between layers.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUlZqmMY5p8 
---
Here's some media if you'd rather watch.
---
You forgot the declaration of "World First 30!" in the stream title.
---
Ah yes just another post from someone bitching and complaining about others bitching and complaining.
---
What does this even mean? Lol
---
Summer quite literally means June 21/22 to September 21/22.  Its defined by the equinox.  That's quite simply a fact.
---
In elywnn im taking 3-4 damage a hit from same level mobs (on warlock) and any class can kite them infinitely
---
MAybe make a human and see if it feels different, I haven't compared to any ally leveling videos from vanilla though
---
Its almost like they should have a test period where experienced players test out the game and make sure this sort of thing does not make it live.
---
Stupid Blizz
---
Because obviously Blizzard hasn't listened to the community at all during any of this process, right? Like they didn't change their stance on loot trading or any features?
---
Fuck off, the point of complaining is to be heard and let Blizzard understand the player side of things that disagree with their choices.
---
discussion police, here to save us from ourselves
---
No. Regen is pretty much what I remember from vanilla. The first time I played a p server I noted how slow it was at early levels and how much faster mana regenerated at higher levels.
---
Now if the regen stays the same ‚Äúspeed‚Äù when you are in the 20-30 area then it‚Äôs a problem.
---
As expected, people are comparing beta to their private server.
---
I'm just here to see how many people got triggered over the hat.  
---
I'm pleasantly disappointed.
---
i feel like a lot of anti-layering people overestimate (in my opinion) the duration of that system and the consequences/availability of ressources/layer-swapping etc.
---
Then you didnt get in, there would be a drop down above install which you would use to select the beta
---
[https://i.imgur.com/9g1qxs5.png](https://i.imgur.com/9g1qxs5.png)
---
That just means you have 1 WoW account, if you get into the beta the region/account menu will pop up and you can select beta from there, you can create a second WoW account in your account management if you wan't the peace of mind of seeing the menu.

And he still updates it to this day.
---
A small sacrifice? You are giving up the whole purpose of vanilla
---
You know they having the option to just tell them in game about bugs.
---
the stress test 2 days before release?
---
Same as you. No invite though. Don't get your hopes too high
---
Forgot /sarcasm in the reply. I healed / DPS / and tanked in Vanilla. It's not easy, but ohhh lord is it fun
---
Nope everything seems pretty spot on. You can even check it on Joanna‚Äôs videos if you can‚Äôt remember.
---
HP/Mana Regen does seem way out of control for sure, at least out of combat. It almost looks like BFA out of combat regen, but I haven't been paying much attention after everyone starting getting over level 7.
---
Except that he's subbed to WoW as we speak.
---
Yeah because 70,000 people watching streamers who don‚Äôt report bugs shouldn‚Äôt get the chance to give feedback either, you‚Äôre very intelligent :).
---
You'll make plenty as a good warrior, but remember they are the most gear dependent class. Youll need some sick gear to do good damage, but with a healer you can get away with lesser gear and still crush. Rogues are less gear dependent and have much more utility as far as CC goes.
---
do you seriously think that blizzard browses reddit more than their own feedback forums? the fate of the game lies in blizzard hands and how they choose to consider what feedback etc...
---
\*sees seven hundred different threads where people are complaining\*
---
\*makes own thread asking why instead of...you know\*
---
I'm thinking of rolling a Hunter, as I mostly want to PvP at max level (wPvP and BGs)... but the BIG YELLOW NUMBER videos have me considering Mage even though I never enjoyed leveling one or the combos available to them. The videos just make them look so good, so skilled! Ditto for Warrior. Warrior was my first higher level character in TBC and I pretty much considered an alt the whole time I played it.
---
What has me hesitating is the lack of burst I guess? Hunter videos seem cool! but the numbers aren't the same as other ones? I know most videos are just highlights so I guess I just need someone to tell me about their experience playing as or vs. hunters. Although I'm not into raiding or PvE that much, it's a huge part of the game and would like to maybe even tank raids or heal (Priest?) instead of going Hunter but I don't expect to  be a hardcore player (going to prioritize IRL) so I don't think either option helps you much in terms of getting a slot vs being a lowby Hunter. My friends like to raid so I just worry I will be left out of the gearing + since I won't be hardcore I don't expect to hit rank 14 so PvP gear will need to be supplemented by raids?? am I wrong? I'm not sure what to expect from my class decision, not to mention all the talk about falling off as Tiers progress (although the devs spoke about not going that route in Classic beyond T1-T2?). Lots on my mind, lots of time to figure this out I hope..
---
Except they‚Äôll actually get in
---
What‚Äôs the timer for? lol
---
Just roll a paladin and have the option to heal, tank, and be a dwarf :)
---
They‚Äôve said they do, and if you don‚Äôt think triple A companies have employees who look at Reddit and the upvote system to garner feedback for their own games than idk what rock you‚Äôve been living under my man.
---
Chuck Norris won a staring contest with the sun.
---
Mainly streamers who are playing beta, most of them have low or no vanilla experience, so a thread like this is needed so people watching streams can report bugs.
---
No one was worried they would shard different servers together you DOLT. The  threads popping up explain the *difference* between layering and sharding are under the assumption that people were retarded enough to think they would shard different servers. That goes against the core concept of vanilla wow. Nothing has changed other than the name they call it. People who dont want sharding, dont want layering either. Its the same fucking thing.
---
Literal WoW legend: No beta  
---
Literal cringelord sellout: Exclusive developer interview to sell out even harder and beta invite.  
---
Loooool
---
There's "people being allowed to change their opinion" and "People being absolute assholes until they were proven wrong only to change their tune as if they were with us the entire time"
---
It's just him trying to grab more subs and people will fall for it too.
---
&gt; Some one not as lazy as me needs to compare mob damage to joanna's leveling video
---
Someone not as lazy as me needs to as well.  I skimmed through the first video and they hardly take any damage.  The damage they do take is like 1 point.
---
&gt; Priest in my experience is easiest to play, but also hardest (if you go disc, as your attacks heal)
---
This guy vanillas.
---
... you can use current player base in expansions to properly extrapolate. All retail players have access, an extremely large % will make use of that. Look at classic RS. Most retail players will be playing, and to blizzard's benefit, they'll keep paying their sub in spite of what happens to classic.
---
The guy is a huge fake. More than half the shit he says is inaccurate. And to top it off he didn‚Äôt even play vanilla.
---
The super duper pro classic guys went absolutely insane when Nostalrius closed.  They definitely made the Classic look bad.  Now that its Blizzard sanctioned it's easier to come around
---
Uwotm8
---
Dhk makes it so killing quest givers is at least desensitized.
---
everyone look at this edgelord, he's probably the most scary 13yo in the class!
---
Blizzard had people banned for streaming private servers, they'll decide what is best for them.
---
I'd say I never get invited to beta but I was invited to Hearthstone beta, HotS Alpha, and BfA Alpha. I wish I had this though!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
everything you said was from the perspective of a single player, going around and doing things
---
to do all the things you mentioned, you're gonna have to meet other humans
---
do stuff with them
---
figure out which humans are putting in effort similar to what you're putting in
---
play with them
---
do stuff
---
or you can pug it 24/7
---
you can do it on one character, or many
---
when the fun runs out, it's down to your self discipline. if you don't find the playtime to be worth it, to be 'fun', then...you won't play
---
I did play vanilla, and that‚Äôs the problem - I know it wasn‚Äôt this easy.
---
Maybe the damage is fine - but the regeneration clearly isn‚Äôt - and that‚Äôs effecting all aspects of the game.
---
but but but i need to be specifically told that I can achieve what I want and in the way that I want, give me internet hugs!!!
---
Holy shit lol. Makes it so much worse.
---
He was simply asking what you meant.  You seem a bit on edge dude.
---
good, fucker needs to finish his alliance guide :D
---
I got in! Account has been active off and on since vanilla beta. Subbed about three months ago, have not upgraded to BFA.
---
You are comparing apples and oranges if you are not comparing the same race and class.
---
okay, u got a source for "reddit is more important that our own beta feedback forums although there is no actual proof of people submitting errors actually playing our beta"?
---
lol i see that burnout filter working well
---
That release date ruined my day. Every streamer was hinting at something BIG, one of them said take Tuesday off, another said people will have to multitask during the GoT finale. There were subs speculating that RELEASE was going to happen. The hype had never been more real. Then to find out that it wont be here for another three months...and im a grad a 2nd year grad student, classes start 8/19. Release date news was worse than hearing my dog had to be put down, and i loved that dog.
---
No one threw away starting food and water - it mattered too much.
---
And now; ‚Äúeh, dump it‚Äù.
---
stop crying bro, this is how it has always worked, except that it used to be f&amp;f instead of popular streamers. same shit.
---
Would be easier for him if he has access to the beta lol...
---
No, I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why it seems like the world is ending on this sub. The information I‚Äôve consumed seems to suggest layering is super temporary. Also, people seem to be losing their minds over a beta. You get the game in August. I don‚Äôt see why it matters if just streamers get to play the beta for now... I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter who tests it as long as I get the full game and layering is super temporary and I get to traverse old school Azeroth with my friends. 
---
I guess I‚Äôm just super grateful we got a release date and now days people can easily stream themselves playing a beta... if you want to see that. I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs corrupt like I‚Äôve seen suggested. Perhaps I‚Äôm totally wrong.
---
Looks like even some of the smaller streamers/youtubers got in as well. Even some of the smaller ones. I agree with ya though, there are probably a ton who think they're bigger than they are and they'll be knocked down a peg when they don't get an invite today.
---
I have an ultrawide and will never go back. You don't gain any real advantage. But still feels nice and looks better, especially in other games imo. 
---
Alt tab bong take a whopping half a second. Getting 2 monitors is not necessary. Maybe a bit faster but meh.
---
It sure does, man :(.  I know so many people who would have provided solid feedback for the beta, all of which have a presence on YouTube/Twitch, and not a single one received an invite.
---
Would you trust post from people on Reddit who aren‚Äôt playing it?
---
[deleted]
---
Burn in hell.
---
And which streamers would that be?
---
lol get off him dude
---
My question of course is: What if a server has 4 layers, each with 3k players and only half of them quit. Then we are stuck with a server that has 3k pop limit and 4.5k players.
---
Ah, oops
---
Summary:
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Mob was already dead.
---
Havent seen a single person get dazed once.

I watched Joana in Tiragarde Keep when he was 1-2 levels lower than the mobs and he took 6-10 damage depending on which mob (10 was mostly the named mob at the top). Watching Cdew go through there rn he's 0-1 levels higher and taking 6-7 damage per hit. Same armor class. Seems accurate but maybe it's different for other zones.
---
Dude they are level fucking 5. Yes it was like this. Your spells costed a lot to cast but you got your mana back really quick between pulls.
---
You barely had to drink until around 10 and even then not really until the higher teens.
---
because the world genuinely doesn't seem to be ending ' on this sub'. to you it seems to be ending in each specific complaint thread you see
---
and since we're all unique human beans, we all have our own personal reasons why we think the world is ending
---
you could go to each of their threads, ask them why they perrrrrrrrrrrrsonally feel the world is ending, and get individualized answers
---
or you can make your own thread and have people come in here and speculate on 'why the sub XYZ'
---
your not understanding in no way devalues or invalidates what somebody else thinks about this beta
---
Thank you! Fits my monitors perfectly.
---
9k pop! WOW who called the brain trust? Talk about totally changing the vanilla experience. Just so we're clear, instead of *one phase at most* of layering, you want to permanently fuck up the server?
---
&gt; unless you're a casual who can't handle waiting for mobs other people have on farm.
---
Oh lord, get the fuck over yourself. Sometimes I swear there's only sweaty nerd virgins on this subreddit.
---
Uh no. He was either trolling, or he has no place in this thread.
---
I never said ‚Äúreddit is more important‚Äù, I‚Äôm sure you know that and now you‚Äôre doing the typical reddit thing of changing what I said in order to keep the conversation going because you are just hard pressed to challenge my thread asking for a discussion post instead of having 20 people spamming posts.
---
Have a good day my man.
---
JesseCox is playing Shaman with Crendor playing Hunter.
---
Did you even watch the videos in the OP?  It shows retail footage from tbc versus what is in the beta.
---
It‚Äôs accurate. These people don‚Äôt know what they are talking about.
---
Heh ‚Äúhuman beans‚Äù
---
Preach brother
---
&gt; You are comparing Cactus Apples and ~~oranges~~Tough Jerky if you are not comparing the same race and class.
---
Just like leaving the fate of the game to redditors who aren‚Äôt in the beta but believe they know everything is better?
---
Implying that dailies in Vanilla are any better
---
Are we really comparing human warlock to a tauren druid now? 
---
Fuckin hell lol 
---
I'm playing nelf druid and the regen is exactly what I fucking remember...3 wrath and oom. And I have never touched a P server.
---
Wouldn't it be funny if it was the private servers that were off? 
---
I've never played on a pServer and I can't say anything feels particularly strange to me.
---
&gt;do you seriously think that blizzard browses reddit more than their own feedback forums?
---
&gt;They‚Äôve said they do, ....
---
have a nice day :x
---
+1
---
Free publicity &gt; anything. I have yet to see a streamer report anything yet all the fans watching are posting threads and stuff left and right. Fun times, lol
---
what you're saying is that people can abuse the system
---
just like every other wow iteration
---
Just don‚Äôt try dude. This community will never be happy. They really don‚Äôt remember accurately and they pretend they do.
---
OP is big gay
---
It's ok brother you aren't alone.
---
Complains about spam posting makes the same post that‚Äôs already been made by other people.
---
Idk dude you know I‚Äôm right but you‚Äôre obviously this desperate for social interaction in your life you‚Äôve baited me into even another response...I guess you win at the end of the day either way
---
Retail spent a long time fractured into multiple categories with different streamers using different categories which severely impacted twitch viewership of wow. I know this isn't a one to one comparison, but it may be in the best interest of both version to have them together.
---
Wouldn't it be funny if it was the private servers that got it wrong, and you who remembered it wrong? 
---
I'm playing druid, I cast about 2-3 wraths and I'm oom and regen is basically what I remember it being in vanilla. I've never touched a private server.
---
I don't think there's ever been a beta or PTR with oceanic servers, I would not expect them here either.
---
Link me another post asking for a pinned thread within the last 3 hours
---
I‚Äôll wait
---
Maybe they wanna give everyone else a head start?
---
That was a feature added in wotlk I think, specifically with low level mobs (I think under level 5 or so?). Hopefully people are bug reporting this stuff. Man I wish I was in there :(
---
They add a queue, or, if they drastically overestimated attrition, they basically just peel a layer off and make it a new server. There's a bit if finessing required in terms of who to transfer (do you just offer free xfers or whatever), but that would be the general idea.
---
what the fuck is wrong with you mate xDD
---
How is vanilla battlegroups not cross realm? It is a smaller selection of realms sure but it's still very much cross realm. We have no idea how many servers Classic will have or how the battlegroups will work so it seems a strange thing to be arguing specifics over.
---
Don't think there will be yet for the sake of testing purposes. I'm almost 100% certain they will be there on release though.
---
A) It will be less than six months
---
B) Far more people still play retail than on private servers, even if retail is in a bad spot
---
C) A lot of people still really enjoy raiding, and raiding is the one thing that has generally only improved as the series has gone on
---
40 ping in game but bg's will be on us so it's screwed either way lmao.
---
[removed]
---
Missing your brain. LOL
---
That's exactly how launches worked in vanilla, and the intention. The point of layering is that you don't have *5000* players in the zone that couldn't even support the vanilla numbers.
---
OCE servers will be a thing but we'll be in an NA battlegroup like fkn always so expect tragic ping most bgs.
---
more noise needs to be made about this else we're going to be one of the only regions that has to deal with fluctuating ping in instanced pvp, we dont want to be fully cut off from NA just have the queue/matchmaking system prioritize local games unless theres literally no one queueing.
---
Great point.
---
About as good of an idea as leaving it to a bunch of paranoid and toxic private server lunatics on this sub lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp4qoo/classic_beta_bug_megathread/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Movies, yes. Games, no.
---
Okay, re-reading the statement I see where you were coming from with that and it's not wrong in that context specifically. The problem with the statement is that it doesn't take into account that while yes, it's the same resources gained per capita, but those resources don't exist in a bubble solely obtainable by the population of a given layer. They are also available to the populations of the other layers simultaneously via trading. At the same time, people from other layers can migrate between the layers to gain more resources that haven't been gathered yet, making a net multiplication in the availability of resources to an individual player on two fronts, via trading and via layer-hop gathering.
---
A good way to describe this is SMT (Simultaneous Multi-threading) in modern CPUs, where a single core can act like 2 cores by interleaving tasks. When one thread of execution has slots available to be used by another thread, it can be meshed in those available slots in parallel. Making better use of all available resources of a single core.
---
Like this [graphic](https://www.cyberus-technology.de/assets/images/posts/zombieload/smt.png), imagine each square as a resource node, and the two colors as a gatherer running between node spawns. Notice that the bottom axis of the graph, time, is reduced by this interleaving. Which in this case with WoW resource gathering would correlate with rate of gathering. As the rate of gathering goes up, so does the inflation of resources.
---
Not really sure how rallying to petition Blizz to play a version of the game that very clearly a lot of people want to play after nostalrius shut down, makes the  classic look bad?
---
I get there are trolls, but you get lot of trolls in retail and every other game too.
---
Basing your opinions entirely on what Blizzard sanctions or doesn't sanction, just makes you a bit of a fan-boy
---
Asmongold has been streaming for 8 hours now and has reported a total of zero bugs.
---
I know he‚Äôs an entertainer and promoter, but if you don‚Äôt think a thread like this is needed then I hope you don‚Äôt roll on whatever private server that copies blizzards ‚Äútemplate‚Äù for vanilla wow and does it the right way.
---
It's not gonna be past phase 1 for sure.
---
You get to test and play the game 3 months prior to launch
---
I don't even know what the goal of regrowth was. They ended up making the highest rank of it in BC cost less than the vanilla one. Although it is reworked substantially.
---
The ability is just a hot mess in vanilla. If there wasn't very specific fights in PvE and certain situation in PvP nobody would use it. Honestly for people just starting a druid i would say limit its use unless you have some consumables at the ready. ~900 mana is absurd for the coefficient it gets.
---
Feels about right to me. Maybe the private servers are wrong.
---
Another "this looks wrong!" thread with no comparison to what the "right" version is...
---
I didn't say anything about private servers.  In the clip listed above it is footage from retail tbc.  As some people have pointed out however druids do have far lower mana compared to other classes and I did find a warlock streaming and it does seem closer.
---
Ah, I see you lacking the critical reading skills to understand basic things.
---
He‚Äôs not asking for a megathread to be pinned like I am, he‚Äôs trying to farm karma and make the thread himself.
---
So uh 
---
Yeah
---
Thanks for proving my point pal.
---
Done this before. But it wasn't in classic. I think wotlk? So dunno if it will work
---
What if our 'battlegroup' contains just Oceanic realms?
---
Obviously more information is needed, but I feel this could be a very easy solution. I arena'd for a bit in legion and when I versed someone from the states with 300 ping it got old real fast.
---
GiantBomb?
---
???
---
I'm still playing on live and raiding but don't have anywhere near as much time as I did back when vanilla was relevant content.  I might play super casually but thinking back through it realistically, I don't think that the game aged well into the current gaming environment.  I feel that it was a great game for the time, but I don't really have a huge desire to re-do the grind again.  Maybe on a different class it would be interesting.
---
I would disagree, it was more of a sideways progression with TBC imo. Some aspects got a lot better and some were made worse.
---
I've played since early vanilla (about a month or so after original launch) and I did NOT get into beta. I've been in previous betas, so I was kind of shocked/disappointed.
---
But...I also didn't have a sub from Nov 2018 to April 2019 (just resubbed a few weeks ago), so that may have hurt my chances.
---
Watch Joana's videos. Damage is the same.
---
I don't think that functionality has ever been built into WoW's engine so what do you think the chances are of Blizzard putting development time into it just for our region?   
---
Also, it could have really bad balance implications, like ranking on OCE servers being excessively hard or even easy.   
---
Classic WoW has spell batching and was built for 200+ MS so imo, we will be fine. Don't get your hopes up.
---
Dungeons are instanced though.
---
it's the original data innit? it is accurate
---
Yes.
---
Blizzard skims the top posts, they obviously don‚Äôt read autistic threads like this one, so important shit should be where they can see it....
---
Is this really so hard to understand?
---
The "right" version is on private servers, AKA not vanilla lol.
---
Trying to farm karma like you but yours is having the opposite effect. 
---
Still there‚Äôs a thread already why need to make post asking for more?
---
If the mods thought it was necessary to have one then they would have made one.
---
yeah, im farming karma in a 4k online sub, ure smart xD
---
Dang, this is almost my exact scenario (except I re-subbed a few weeks ago) and I did not get in.
---
Maybe that's one of the reasons I've been frustrated when trying the last few xpacs.
---
I remember just feeling hopelessly lost in new dungeons because nobody was CCing or waiting for mana or organizing pulling.
---
I was just a pullfest and mana was overly plentiful and I kinda hated it.
---
You are aware that mob casted 2 dot spells and 1 auto right? Do you expect dot spells to instantly kill someone?
---
Probably,but Hp/mana reg is wrong. Have not seen 1 single person eating/drinking. But ye still beta.
---
Yeah it's a human warlock being compared to tauren druid, it's a nonsense thread.
---
Hey, at least the kids are playing good games
---
Because I don‚Äôt give a shit about internet points my man.
---
Sorry if it‚Äôs getting your almonds activated that I asked for a central point for discussion my man. I‚Äôm done replying to you because this is autistic.
---
You act like you should need a 10m group for a fuckin starting zone rare.
---
That original clip was something I linked as well and I thought it was way off but after some digging I found a more comparable clip.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DeadEsteemedShallotHoneyBadger
---
Looks more correct.
---
What private servers are still popular? I tried retro-wow so I could practice some lvl 60 pvp and AV was like 7 vs 12 or something stupid. AB was 5v7....
---
I completely agree. 
---
Either have a separate battlegroup for Aussies, or have a priority system where it matches us with other OCE realms at prime hours and anywhere else if queues are too long (12am onwards).
---
But of course!!
---
That's not how truth works. He says it'll be gone within the first few weeks. If it's not gone by the end of the first month, then he was lying. They didn't say that there would be no sharding, so idk if its you who's the liar here or what. In fact they said the opposite of that, that there would be sharding.
---
I'm watching staysafetv who's currently a level 10 warlock and hes regenerating nearly double what the very low lvl warlock in the 2008 video is...
---
No he doesn't have a point at all. It has been explained exactly how it will work.
---
They arent the same race,or class even...
---
Hey guys checkout my thread i made to help people find the CE :)

---
So does it just show up under all the other games on the side bar?
---
Do you know what a critical hit is
---
Yeah, fuck people giving feedback about the system to give the developers time (during the beta period in which they are soliciting feedback), to give the developers the ability to attempt to adjust their plans for the system to try and address the potential pitfalls of the system.
---
Classic WoW has spell batching built into it which means very good lag compensation in comparison to retail. It won't be anywhere near as bad.  
---
Having our battlegroup just contain Oceanic servers could have really bad consequences like making ranking excessively hard, almost impossible or even way too easy. This is due to our small population in comparison to Americas region.
---
No. A release "time frame" can get moved forward. But once that specific date is set, it is set.
---
3 dmg seems low, even for a possibly partial resist
---
Yeah if that's all it was then I would agree.  There were a LOT of extremely toxic people doing very toxic things.  It was super annoying.  That being said I dont play retail anymore and I'm hype as shit for classic.  
---
But if you cant acknowledge that a TON of people took it top far idk what to tell you.

---
I wasn't expecting it, but I'm in

No email announcement, but checked the launcher and it installed
---
Did not play BFA.  Haven't played seriously since Wrath.  Resubbed and logged in recently (Legion) just to see my old char.

First account was made at classic launch
---
He‚Äôs been streaming that long but the beta hasn‚Äôt even been live that long.  
---
I don‚Äôt need to play a private server I have beta access.  So enjoy watching streams of others getting to play. 
---
And nowhere does it say you have to report bugs while playing on the beta. 
---
If you want your bug reports you are putting in from watching others play try the actual forms no some sub Reddit that won‚Äôt be watched as much.
---
9k pop cap WOW who called the brain trust? congratulations, you've now made every launch day problem worse, and still don't manage to address something like dying servers. talk about changing the vanilla experience. I just want to make sure we're clear here, instead of *one phase at most* of layering, you want to permanently fuck up server pop? top fuckin mind
---
oh lord, get the fuck over yourself
---
Don‚Äôt pretend this isn‚Äôt about money and advertising
---
This is the boomer take.
---
Not this close to a release no, but half a year? Numerous games have been pushed.
---
To be fair, a lot of people have proven themselves retarded enough to warrant those infographics.
---
every single streamer has a invite. (asmongold put the tick for the classic beta 5 hours before the servers went online)
---
coincedence? i dont think so. wannabe celebs taking our slots.
---
Yeah from watching Esfand's and Asmon's perspective from 1-10 so far i feel they're dealing too much damage and receiving too little, feel regen rates of health and mana need slight adjustments as well.
---
Yes you‚Äôre going to regenerate fast when you have no mana and health. Tauren Druids start with almost no mana which is why it regenerates fast and why you go oom after 2-3 wrath casts at the early levels.
---
Yes this can definitely happen, but I don‚Äôt think blizzard would do it. Notably, Kingdom hearts 3 was pushed one month (from December 2018 to Jan 2019) after its announce date.
---
100%
---
Hmm well I'm currently watching staysafe tv, a lvl 10 warlock, and he's regenerating more then the much lower lvl warlock in the 2008 video so I don't know.
---
I am not saying it is perfect, just that your example was flawed. If it is indeed wrong, I am sure they will fix it
---
I'm not blizzard and I can't tell you what they will do... but there are plenty of options if some servers just happen to retain a lot more people than normal after phase one. Possible server q's and just cap the servers at a vanilla amount, free character transfers for people who may just want to get off the overpopulated server if they don't want to be on it, and if a lot of servers have this issue just simply open up more servers... not everyone is going to progress to an extremely high level in the first few months and a lot might just want to get off that server.
---
Uldir race.
---
no TB Org zep in classic.
---
I understand your logic but it‚Äôs flawed. The layers will never be identical unless all 3 happen to be perfectly filled. In reality, because they try to keep previous layers full, the last layer has a force acting *against* letting it fill
---
Haha got him!
---
Runscape.com was too (no e)
---
Is that a reason for me to shut up about it? I would take that as a reason to be even more vocal about this situation...
---
Gee it's almost like they're different people saying those things. Amazing!
---
You're right. If we do get our own realms though wouldn't the same problem still apply?
---
For memory, rankings were server based yeah?
---
Oh fuck off. TipsOut has been a cornerstone for the Classic WoW community.
---
I hope so.
---
Hi, /u/lopjae
---
So stupid bloody Krygoz  and tips out doing this BS... such noobs
---
No I mean everyone pissed that asmongold got one for example.
---
Plus I didn‚Äôt say shut up, the hostility isn‚Äôt necessary home boy
---
Back in vanilla our battlegroup were the other OCE realms (frostmourne, barthillus, Jubeithos etc - from memory). However at that time all realms were hosted in US so our ping in our own realm and in pvp was 200+
---
If there enough OCE realms then an OCE battlegroup should be an achievable goal for classic.
---
I like the idea of a prioritised queue with a minimum wait time before sourcing non OCE realms.
---
Another solution could be hosting OCE pvp games on the OCE infrastructure. It would only be fair that the US had bad ping against us for a change ^^
---
They're a bunch of boomers with lives, no way they even check reddit.

---
How is your hypes ruined because you can't get into beta. Don't be so dramatic. Yeah it sucks we can't play but who cares it's just the beta. Everything is reset for launch lmao
---
money
---
How could it? It‚Äôs become the biggest thing ever. It‚Äôs only the beginning, unfortunately
---
My point tho is that all of this is done to solve the issue of people having to transfer from their servers where they have cultivated relationships.
---
In my scenario (which is a pretty bad scenario i can admit) half of the players who started their journey on this server would have to split up from their new found friends and go to other places.
---
WoW!! I hope blizzard implements a way for people to thoroughly test this game to find all the things that need to be fixed so tha....... WAIT A MINUTE!!!!!
---
Hostility wasn't directed at you. And I'm not pretending to mean anything other than what I said.
---
I didnt know long queues and empty servers were required for classic. 
---
A few weeks of layers which someone may or may not exploit won't make or break a year or 2 of classic.
---
He already stopped playing the beta and is back in retail. Now he's just looking at an alliance leveling guide hahaha
---
Make him proud man. Speechless
---
I changed to that setting but still don't have a dropdown menu.
---
You just gave me so much hope! I've been at work all day checking my email
---
Read again...
---
&gt; **This has not ruined my hype for Classic tho**
---
&gt; im just sad i wont be able to participate in the beta because there is no way i would give Blizzard a dime without knowing for sure that i will be getting a beta invite.
---
I‚Äôm all for layering but would you have made the same post about sharding? 
---
Blizzard clearly does listen to feedback, it doesn‚Äôt mean they will do whatever the consumer demands but there is definitely a point to complaining if you don‚Äôt like it.
---
Vanilla WoW database shows that mob's damage range from 3-5
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?npc=2953#comments
---
Only the hardcore guilds aren't going to be taking hunters into raids. If you had been on the raid team you're most likely to keep your seat into Naxx. And Naxx is the last raid in vanilla and not until the end of the phases etc. From launch onward for months you'll be doing great. 
---
Wouldn't be a bad idea to raid MC &amp; BWL if you wanna stomp on people. That goes for any of the classses. Naxx gear has a large advantage over everything else and other classes start doing crazier and crazier deeps but that isn't until the end and the majority of players won't even get that far in raiding. 
---
I'm also going to do a hunter for pvp. It's going to be great, friend.
---
Play dumb all you want, you're not fooling me.
---
You die pretty easy to certain mobs https://clips.twitch.tv/NiceAdventurousPuffinLitFam
---
Do you need to have a active BFA subscription right now to get the Classic Beta or no? My subscription just ran out a couple of days ago.
---
Mmm yeah. Legion+ only player. Great choice for some vanilla testing.  
---
So far Blizzard's invite choices have been like selecting players for an orchestra and getting shitty flute covers as a result.
---
I think there was a couple of reasons: inflates subs before the actual launch (money), gives a high five to people who have been supporting them all this time, and what would stop me from making a bunch of free accounts for the beta?  I know they said the older the account the better chance, but that doesn‚Äôt mean a new account couldn‚Äôt get in still.
---
I haven‚Äôt been subbed in close to 10 years.  I‚Äôm a little upset but at the end of the day I can wait three more months.
---
It's weird that I haven't seen a single streamer drink/eat, just mob to mob to mob without having to stop even for a second, and a level 10 warlock on this perfectly blizzlike server is regenerating more than a level 4 warlock from 2008.
---
I didn‚Äôt receive my beta access.
---
Regen is fucked.
---
Yes, you need to have an active WoW sub.
---
Biggest bug I‚Äôve found so far is I never got an invite.
---
I'd rather have layers than queues. I will have about ~4 hours to play each night and I really don't like to queue for 12 hours or need to take remote connection to my PC to start queueing.
---
The Tauren are looking to cure their Forsaken allies of their condition. So that's one reason. Also, the Scarlet Crusade threatens their new undead allies, so that'd be why theyre there. 
---
Now why is a Dwarf at Scarlet Monastery other than phat loots?
---
There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any daze.
---
Strange analogy.
---
That's for white damage my man
---
Has frost or kargoz gotten an invite? I‚Äôll be a little bummed if they haven‚Äôt.
---
Blizzard wants your "data".
---
They know you never played. They wanna see what the retention time for people like you are. Test it out, if you like it test the shit out of it. If you after level 5 feel like logging off and uninstalling, then do it and dont feel obligated to continue. Blizzard will have the data they need.
---
you can play the retail ptr right now for free with no subscription. but you need one to play classic beta. let that sink in. u think this is really for "testing"?
---
I'm not jealous, nope, I didn't want a key anyway.
---
Anyway, just to play and see what an mmo is supposed to be like :P
---
they literally copy pasted the values from 1.12 client they had from back in the day. the values are right
---
You don't play a test. You test the game. 
---
If you think you're playing in a beta you're doing it wrong.
---
Damn I decided to not sub back for beta cuz I only played Legion (lost my old account that played in vanilla/tbc/wrath). Maybe I shoulda tried now that I see posts like this :P
---
Who the hell has "months" of vacation
---
Its just a game not a life
---
$$$
---
How do you mean?
---
Health regen seems like a problem
---
It is possible for them to give a high five to people who support them without having a sub demand.
---
Give 80% of the first keys to people who have been subbed for more than 12 months in the last 24 months. High fives given.
---
Give the rest of the keys to random people who signed up for beta. They will however need to get a sub before they can join. Problem solved.
---
&gt; and what would stop me from making a bunch of free accounts for the beta? 
---
You still have to sub to join the beta, just not for getting an invite. You know "Grats you have been invited to the Classic WoW Beta testing. Start up a WoW subscription &lt;&lt;Here&gt;&gt; to get started".
---
Play to find bugs. That's what you're for.
---
if you cant understand the difference between a beta and a ptr then im not sure what to tell ya
---
Sure, but then you'd have to stop using toilets.
---
I find it hard to believe that you know how classic played better than blizzard.
---
What is ur deal
---
could you list all the classes you consider A tier in bwl and the classes you consider A tier in Naxx?
---
Its from World of Roguecraft 2
---
Time for a fucking crusade
---
this is what were dealing with. smh
---
I would be happy if everyone at r/frenworld spontaneously died and I don't think there is anything intrinsically racist about MAGA hats.
---
Literally no proof this guy got beta. You're getting mad over a troll.
---
Neither I believe.
---
interesting approach. you'll be paying for someone to boost your account to 60. while i commend your efforts, i feel like you're missing out on the most important part of classic.
---
how much are you paying?
---
You don't need a subscription to get an invite. You need Subscription to play off you got invited
---
this would have been an issue BEFORE classic wow
---
I'm actually amazed that this still isn't covered considering the demo.  
---
This guy in this video could have 1 v 4'd the quilboars based on the damage he was taking.  
---
Considering a warrior had his hands full with 1 enemy in vanilla, I'm amazed.
---
Isn't there already a thread on this?
---
lal
---
Game is literally unplayable 
---
Because I didn't get an invite
---
Man, either the private servers are whack or people here really do remember things a bit differently than I do. 
---
I've never played on a private server (mercifully), but this idea that you couldn't pull 2 mobs without dying in vanilla is fucking nonsense, especially as a warrior or some shit. 
---
He pulls one mob that's a level higher and one mob that's a level lower and he ends up around half health to kill them...that seems about normal.
---
Frost is easily one of the best content creators and Kargoz‚Äôs level guides are second to none.
---
I dont  understand
---
How much should it do?
---
6 slot bags cost 25s and 8 slot bags cost 2g from vendor
---
Any time spent making this was too much time...
---
yall look dumb now lol
---
I honestly believe that there will be enough demand in Australia for say, 2 PvP and 1 PvE realms. This is completely anecdotal however and I do not have any statistics to prove it. 
---
It's funny you say that about the US. When I played retail a year or so a go I would host groups to run a raid occasionally. If someone from the US joined, they'd say 'ahh fucking shit ping, sorry guys i gotta bail' and off they'd go. Some would stay but most would bail. 
---
I'd always think 'we've been dealing with this since the birth of wow, and also in WC3!'.
---
Hit/miss ratio is way off, people hit lvl 10 mobs at lvl 6 with no problem
---
first accurate thing that boring fat fuck has ever said tbh
---
It‚Äôs not, they‚Äôve been trolling every post saying this.
---
My favorite was TipsOut saying in his Beta video that they forgot to add in quest arrows to the UI like they had in Vanilla.
---
L oh fucking L the people they let into this thing
---
Hey its me your brother
---
What fucking vanilla did you guys play lmao. He kills 2 quillboars, one a level higher one a level lower and ends up at about half health. 
---
You couldn't pull 15 mobs and faceroll them but this idea that every single mob you fought was a dark souls boss or some shit is just ludicrous.
---
Well sumbitch.   I did begin in tbc, ill gladly admit.
---
Blizzard prob don't want it split because they want to increase BFAs exposure I'm guessing and classic views help put wow higher on Twitch
---
You can start playing retail (battle for Azeroth) for you to accommodate with the genre. Im not really into Bfa rn, but classic will be a different experience and a bit of wow experience would make you play better. Try playing until lvl 20 without paying the subscription on retail. 1/2 characters, different classes.
---
This might help
---
From your link:  
---
&gt;Effect #1	(2) School Damage (Nature) 
---
**Value: 64**  
---
What's the value 64 mean?
---
Made one.
---
There's going to be a lot of shitposts without some way to verify between people who actually have the beta and those who don't.
---
And many streamers are playing human. Humans have spirit racial. Spirit is HUGE in vanilla especially at early levels.
---
actiblizz needs to prop up their financials after the dumpster fire that BFA is lost them tons of subs so they want thousands of ppl to sub for the next 3 months trying to get beta acess and to reserve names
---
It's gonna be okay.
---
So that seems to be a racist point you are making...
---
Yeah but you‚Äôre assuming everyone built relationships or even care.  I bet a majority of players don‚Äôt care or get a couple friends and then transfer off together
---
on live there has been periods where server location when zoning into arena etc was decided on a coinflip, meaning US copped the OCE ping for a little while - complaints happened and that got fixed very quickly. oce vs oce is always played locally on live too.
---
This matchmaking tech exists in other blizzard games and works well (OW etc) obviously your differences are OW requires 12 players to start whereas wows bgs start at 20.
---
jsut because batching is a thing doesn't mean fluctuating ping should be the norm, imo oce will have a decently healthy population and this is a good opportunity to adjust the oce matchmaker to restrict looking for NA matches during peak
---
You say that despite classic wow announcements being the highest upvoted topics in the sub?
---
Thank you mods this was desperately needed üëçüèª
---
Yeah - not sure how to deal with that yet besides requiring people to post evidence of beta access, which might be the way we go.
---
Back in the day Chuck Norris sued my space for stealing the name of what he calls everything around him.
---
I can think of few things more boring than watching someone else grind levels in Elwynn Forest.
---
What's the point of this? There is an in-game bug reporter for a reason.
---
They are humans who have a spirit racial...and damage is exactly how I remember it.
---
^
---
This is a very good reply. If you notice that something is off - texture popping, something disappears, you can't turn in a quest, just report it with the in-game tool but otherwise, if you don't care just play for a bit and uninstall like /u/heisenberg_irl said.
---
2 but none of them officialized like this one.
---
 "/s" "the internet version of a laugh line" 
---
very accurate! I'll keep this one
---
Modern wow and classic wow are very different. Personally I think modern wow might ruin your classic experience since it sets a precedent to achieve a lot quickly and classic may feel too slow in comparison.
---
Modern wow may also form bad habits for you to become anti social, what is enjoyable about classic is it‚Äôs social aspect.
---
So if you want to set yourself up for the best classic experience I would suggest waiting.
---
Ya, I know. Its kinda triggering me how they arent reporting anything.
---
Don‚Äôt even try dude. This sub reddit community is horrible and clearly never played vanilla.
---
Not everyone uses that (unfortunately) and even still, people seem to want to make a bunch of individual posts about it. We'd rather them be somewhat consolidated.
---
Well, i did not assume they care. I simply said that they would have to leave the people they may have bonded with - wether they care or not is not important.
---
Whats important is that "layering" is painted up to be this grand solution to not having dead servers post-launch and being forced to merge servers. But that will still very much be a problem unless they dont have any hard cap on population and just merge layers anyway.
---
It is. People just sucked at the game I guessed üòÇ
---
So that people other than blizzard can discuss?
---
Can depend on the kind of pvp you want to do but early phases of MC &amp; BWL I'd be the hunter for solo world pvp and ganking. I'd also heavily suggest Nelf just because shadowmeld in world pvp (and guarding objectives in bg's) is the bees knees. 
---
If you plan on playing through all the phases and are banking on getting that sweet Naxx gear, the Mage is a good long term investment.
---
I really think it's a combination of both people misremembering and private servers being out of whack.
---
Vanilla was harder and slower than it is now but every mob fight wasn't some kind of ordeal.
---
I dont know i loled
---
That clip looked totally blizzlike to me. Those little felhunter mobs aren't supposed to have high HP.
---
"More than that!" - someone with no proof of how much it actually did in Vanilla WoW
---
Requiring a clip or gif or at the very least screenshot would be a good start. Otherwise people will just be spamming random crap with absolutely no evidence.
---
quest tracker is active.
---
You're not going to get an unbiased answer from a subreddit of people who are literally foaming at the mouth for Classic WoW to release.
---
But that being said, Vanilla (and therefore Classic)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BfA retail for players who like the MMO genre. BfA&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Vanilla for people who like one-and-done games.
---
That is, Vanilla was a massive Skinner Box. It had an absolutely *huge* time sink in all aspects of gameplay compared to BfA, it required you to put in a lot of personal effort to find groups and gear, and your character didn't feel like the Savior of the Universe. For some people who like mobile games, games you can play on the toilet, games that give quick flashy RNG, etc. (and I'm not trying to make a value judgment on such people), this was bad. For people who *wanted* crunchy, grindy gameplay and deep immersion, it was utterly astounding and quite possibly the best game ever made for this purpose.
---
So if you're the sort of person who wants to put in a lot of effort for small rewards but have those rewards be meaningful, long-term, and have a community to share them with, Classic is your choice. If you're the sort of person who wants to put in only a bit of time a day (or week) to get some flashy numbers and gear and enjoy the instant gratification that comes with that, in an essentially solo game that happens to have other people nearby yet not interacting with you, you want BfA. And that's fine if you're that second sort of person. A lot of people are. They want a bit of *Candy Crush* on their lunch break, and that's all they need from gaming. A lot of other people aren't like that, and they've been longing for the return of long-yet-meaningful grinds and the community that comes with a true MMO, hence why this sub exists.
---
Haha imagine comparing a PTR with Beta. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
If so then i am mistaken, the picture i got from reading the news post and talking to people is that i am required to sub in order to get a beta invite.
---
Daze starts at a certain level
---
Wow classic will be my main game &amp; ill definitley be playing all phases. The majority of people seem to say mage is the better choice...my only issue there is i cant be a gnome so ill be stuck with a human bodybuilder in a dress.
---
Dear Uninformed:
---
&gt; Patch 1.1.1 :
---
&gt; The Daze effect has been reworked to have a smaller chance of occurring against players level one to 29. The chance of a successful Daze effect against players 30 and above remains the same.
---
Sincerely,
---
Blizzard who actually have working 1.12
---
The sustained meltdown here is just utterly embarrassing...they should just relax on their private servers and let the chips fall where they may. 
---
Maybe it is off and they'll fix it, or maybe it's their private servers that have been off and Blizzard has access to a more accurate replication of their own game, in which case they are perfectly welcome to stay where they're at.
---
It's almost as if people have different opinions about stuff
---
Got into the beta.
---
Not a steamer, no media presence at all.
---
Resubbed just for a chance to get this beta.
---
Quit during cata.
---
Started summer beta 2004.
---
what race?
---
Dear Uninformed OP:
---
Blizzard,  who actually have working 1.12
---
Yea I'm not gonna say whether the lightning bolt damage is correct but people acting like you were dead pulling more than one mob is ridiculous.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, I got into Legion beta without even being subbed at the time.
---
I have to assume this is just a rant thread because we both know Twitch chat is just retarded
---
It's supposed to be 64 damage. This game is a joke /s
---
twitch chat thinks it's an expert at literally everything but is usually wrong
---
Also someone who forgets taurens at level 4 have 20% average resist making a 75% resist pretty darn likely.
---
I think we should wait until people reach the same level as in the demo and compare the values then to see if it was changed, if it was then it's more than likely correct to as it was in vanilla.
---
Devs are not looking at Twitch Chat, only you are.
---
Devs look at Bug Reporter, which is why there's only a small amount of players in Beta, because they want that feedback to matter/be analyzed
---
Having never played WoW before, would WoW classic be good for me to start? Or is it really only worth for Nostalgic value? I've only ever played Swtor as an MMO.
---
Get out of here with your logic and facts!
---
We thought it was bad but it wasn't
---
Idk man. Im so excited for this game and i see these apes spamming BUG when Hogger isnt one shoted by a autoattack from a level 10 Asmongold.
---
Hunter
---
Yes! Not sure how the spelling got fucked there haha cheers mate.
---
Any change on getting a Human starting zone guide?
---
i have access to joanas 1-60 video and 1.12 client and they both state that this is very far off the actual.
---
Troll. They have great mage racials and passive more mana
---
Did you have to sign up for beta or was it automatically added to your b.net?
---
It‚Äôs not really up to blizzard to be fair lol.
---
Streams look at their chat and at one point might consider listening to them since literally 10k people are spamming "bug". So a bug report might follow their nonsense
---
Hi, /u/lleech123
---
go to account management and create a PTR account, should show up.
---
You‚Äôre kidding right? A cornerstone for classic?
---
Private servers are shutting down once classic is out
---
Ya man, I am triggered right now because no streamer is reporting anything, even when they see a bug. Frustrating
---
Especially on a class that has decent early damage and HP.  
---
I mean I'm playing on my druid right now and I tried to do a two pull in a cave with a named mob and a minion that were both a level higher than me. I could zerg the imp down but then I'd be oom and the named mob would go into cat form and wreck me. 
---
That seemed about right to me, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend I have a photographic memory of every pull I've ever done when I was a teenager.
---
I don't know if the numbers are exactly perfect, but I do know that it feels about right. I have to be a little more careful in caves and areas where you can easily pull a bit too much. 
---
I've not touched a private server so that's not clouding my judgment at all.
---
I always thought mobs in the beginning zones were intentionally slower than mobs in later zones. Could just be bad memory though
---
Well I‚Äôve already done it multiple times in vanilla and I‚Äôm a fairly hard core guild so planning to clear mc in week 4. It‚Äôs costing me about 900 AUD and includes two profs 300
---
The passive aggressiveness in this comment is so high
---
1/10 There are no beta keys.
---
Why the ever loving shit do you care.
---
No you both
---
where in the launcher does it tell you?
---
So how do you know which ranks to use? Just the lowest, a middle, and the highest or how do you decide? Does a Shaman need to do this for each heal?
---
He‚Äôs not really wrong though
---
It's really funny, because many of the complaints I see are the inverse of the complaints I had when I first started playing pservers.
---
Did you see the sodapoppin clip? Mana was never regenning that crazy fast.
---
I heard Undead is also good because of WotF? But I don't think many Ally roll Warlock because of Undead
---
If they are the only one who has a recipe and they scam you... That's a fast track to never making money off of that recipe.  Collateral is pretty solid for more expensive enchants, but again, if they have expensive recipes then they probably won't be ripping people off.
---
Damn, I was hoping they'd be kept around as sort of a quarantine.
---
Would asking Bnet to get 24 hours on the BFa account and getting it , will that still work for Vanilla or do I need to buy a game token or something and add 30 days? Since they just added 24 hours to my gametime.
---
If you notice, it shows the same spell with that same value for 54 mobs.
---
I mean the difference is that in scenario, this is unlikely to happen and even if it DID happen, you have a choice to leave or not.  If you don‚Äôt want to leave then don‚Äôt.  People like me who already have their friends they play with will gladly transfer off for a smaller server. 
---
On every other option there is no choice.  You wait until your server dies, and if it does then you are being FORCED to merge.  And this is the exact same feeling as being on a brand new server.
---
Nah more likely there‚Äôs 10x as many people saying it was always like this and private servers got it wrong and you remember vanilla wrong
---
Right on thanks!
---
I know Hunter is cakewalk for PvE, do they fare well in PvP? Say against a Mage can they win? I know Mage dumpsters most classes but I heard Hunter's if played properly can win.
---
Didn't get an "invite" it was just in my Blizzard Launcher.
---
I opted in last night.
---
I am not a content creator.
---
My sub has been active since day one. (off and on)
---
I played BFA for a bit, got 120 on Alliance and Horde but stopped a few months ago after doing some of the first Raid on Heroic.
---
US.
---
Account was created back in the (original) Beta days.
---
Yes. I played vanilla.
---
Cause it's a shit response imo. There's plenty of good reasons people watch streamers (usually the commentary and chat more than the game), but to say it's just like watching professional sports isn't a comparable thing at all
---
Wow what an ignorant comment. There are no beta keys because the access just gets added to your account. Did you even read the blue post?
---
Unemployed people
---
That‚Äôs mana pool not regen
---
It is cross realm with a couple of others, but its so commonly mis-interpreted to be the same thing as on retail where it shared with ALL realms. We know how battlegrounds worked in the past, just clarifying it for the uninformed that it's different.
---
Well, the original guy was asking about the strength of the classes at general PVP (mix of BG, world, duels, etc) at various PVE gear points. (Before someone jumps down my throat for my answer not being in line with vanilla theorycrafting -- we were talking about PVP performance at PVE thresholds).
---
If you're asking about just PVE performance at these PVE thresholds, I'd say:
---
The same core of classes is A tier in both (Warr, Rogue, Mage). Locks start to join the A-team when they pick up +hit gear and generally this happens with a mix of ZG / AQ40 / BWL gear. 
---
  
---
I would elevate 2H Fury Warr to S tier, as well as perhaps ignite Mages, at the very top end of progression. With Rogues and Lock at that point in a strong A-tier position. 
---
Hunters IMO get too bad of a rap, and their PVE DPS doesn't just fall off a cliff -- t2 + that slow xbow + good skills should keep you as a solid A-/B+ tier class in T2. In full Naxx gear, I'd say hunters are in a very reasonable B tier, simply because they are just not taking off quite the same way as Warr / Mage / Rogue / Lock.
---
You need to create a PTR account in account management.
---
no matter when it gets released its going to be at a bad time for someone though. the world doesnt revolve around one specific group of people
---
For the poor, maybe. All the worst kids from private servers are rolling on classic and I‚Äôm super curious to see how blizzard reacts when devilsaur mafias start mysteriously popping up
---
4000 &gt; 700. Plus if you shard only the starting area like Elywynn then the second you cross into westfall or darkshore ect that same exact problem will happen. And it would be everywhere you think you would be able to level.
---
" /y SOMEONE START A FUCKING GROUP"
---
The fact that Towellie got into the beta after OPENLY bashing classic and the community while Joana and Kargoz didn‚Äôt is a disgrace.
---
"Got my Coors light!"
---
I'm out...
---
Thanks, another question if you don‚Äôt mind as I haven‚Äôt looked into it too much - you only have to pay the subscription until a certain level or to unlock all the classes? Is this the same for classic wow?
---
I dont like to bomb my Ui with addons like some people, but you can just feel it out. If you're healing a dungeon, just mess around healing your tank with various ranks. You will quickly identify what is overkill and which seems to be most efficient.  The lowest rank you can spam to try and get talent tree crit procs for instance, they all have their uses.  Personally on my shaman I used about 3 Healing wave ranks, Two Lesser heal ranks, and 2 Chain heal ranks. Was top 3 healer on K3 and it didnt really require me to be super tryhard.  You will figure it out as long as you are mindful of your mana bar
---
I appreciate all your insight! I‚Äôm definitely going to be more of a classic WoW fan, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll invest too much time into bfa. Thanks!
---
Honestly Hunter and Mage are arguably the two best classes for solo open world game play. They're both excellent at kiting and have great damage with simple rotations but a high skill ceiling. I'd say pick whichever appeals to you more on coolness factor.
---
Maybe try out the WoW head dressing room to look at armor sets with the different classes and races to see which you like more.
---
Young adults in school are a pretty damn big part of the playerbase
---
Ok guess I should strap in to farm mc and ony for almost a year. I don't think you understand the depth of the content released in each phase.
---
Wow really? He gifted me some months of game time because I am 15 and because my parents said I cannot get a job over summer, all I did was explain my situation and I said I had 30$ just for 2 months of classic and sent him the picture of the money with a piece of paper with my username on it. What could he possible do with that? He said he could gift me 2-3 months which I am so grateful for and he has accepted all of the requests because hes a nice guy. What is wrong with you?
---
How long ago did your bnet update?
---
Pedofile alert. No one send this guy your info
---
Sure battlegroups existed but so what. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs super important in this regard
---
Ok so. For retail u only need to pay the subscription for level 20+ content. For you to be able to play classic wow, you will need to be subscribed. Nothing more than that
---
Got a sauce for that, friend?
---
It‚Äôs not streamer only. A lot of others have gotten in. Check the forums.
---
No prob.
---
And frankly, the two games are on the same subscription. Provided you pay for the BfA expac, you can always jump in on occasion for shits and giggles, just like many BfA tourists will do for Classic. It's not an either/or choice in terms of restricted resources.
---
He's a know-nothing scam artist and a pimple on the Classic WoW community, is what he is.
---
You didn't really have to eat/drink in vanilla until you started getting milk.
---
This man crafts wars.
---
They will as a backlash to the complaints
---
I‚Äôve never read a book, but I‚Äôll think I‚Äôll sit down and write one tonight.
---
I've not seen this in a very long time. At work ATM, is the music on it still borked or is their an original somewhere?
---
Was that the deep dive with Skarm?
---
I really wish Skarm would do his own deep dive video.
---
Lirik logged off after like less than an hour of beta.
---
I played both vanilla and a private server recently. Pulling 2 mobs is fine. It gets harder later on but you still weren't instadead if you did. The early levels are notoriously easy due to regen rates and low mob damage. People are overreacting.
---
Yeah by playing the game currently
---
It comes with blizzard games. You should have seen /r/hearthstone back in the day, there were more threads complaining about the people complaining than there were people complaining
---
The regen is what I remember too...I don't have water so I've been standing around for like 30 seconds between some pulls screwing around on discord to get mana back.
---
If it was streamer only the beta would be like 20 people.
---
I love you both
---
Face stabbing works if I utilize a lag switch program and a keyboard macro. 
---
Program: Netlimiter
---
Macro: Logitech G HUB
---
Basically I have one of the mouse buttons bound to backstab to mash it super fast. About 5000 times a second. I run net limiter to make my ping in the red, and I can easily strafe left and right to face stab.
---
Yeah, with Skarm.  Also really like the work that Skarm did on Druid tanking.
---
Do it if you want to. It's a creative outlet, and you can figure it out as you go. You don't need to do it the same way as everyone else, in fact, probably better you don't. Be unique and have fun.
---
Chuck Norris clogs the toilet when he pees.
---
This is such an easy argument to make. The ‚Äúright version‚Äù can only be extrapolated from 2005 era 144p videos
---
top kek.
---
Seems pretty chill.
---
Why are you posting this on r/classicwow post it on r/twitch or something
---
out of curiosity, which streamer are you referring to?
---
Nah bro it was always like this stop hating
---
And once again, the chances of them being 33.33% each or any other percent are the exact. Same. Odds. 
---
Do you understand that?
---
I came to laugh not to feel 
---
Good read though may we all create more happy fond memories we can look back at again
---
Shit man.
---
How ya gonna murder me like that
---
I think its pretty sad these guys get automatic invites they should play the lottery like everyone else.
---
I'm conflicted with rogue as well. I think early in the game there's going to be an absolute metric ton of rogues just based off their history. With that being said, warriors are kings of dungeons/raids and scale throughout the entire progression which is good for raiding.
---
And sharding doesn't change the vanilla experience? I would argue it's less vanilla-like than an arbitrary population cap being enforced. Also, I'm literally insuring against your idea of servers being dead after launch in the exact same way sharding supposedly does. Sharding allows for 9,000 players to be on a server at once, but in 3 separate instances of the world. This, according to you, insures against lots of players leaving the server after launch, thus making sure that certain servers aren't dead after a few months. I see no way in which the sharding solution is better in this sense than just purely increasing the server cap, and perhaps limiting it again in the future based on the future population of the server.
---
&gt;are 
---
Opening more servers just creates more of a chance that you will end up with dead servers. Dead servers are sad and its terrible to be a part of one to the end.
---
again, you dont have the 1.12 client. private servers had to make up a lot of stuff because the couldnt restore the information.
---
the joana video is legit though, maybe you should post precise clips from beta and compare it to a very similiar situation in joanas vid so everyone can compare them :)
---
Step 1 in the old Blizzard ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt like that some players couldn‚Äôt obtain this without serious dedication so we removed it from the game‚Äù playbook. Pour one out for my boy the Ivory Raptor, whose glory will never be known again
---
I just recently joined this sub after the recent official release date announcement. I'd bet a bunch others did too. Before it was like yeah I'll probably play, but now it's like, oh shit it's real, I better do my homework and read some guides because it's been too many years to remember everything. while I did play og vanilla, I don't have as much memory of it as BC or WotLK
---
It seems like a lot but it‚Äôs 2 people spamming ‚Äúbug‚Äù and then other people see them spamming so they join in. Most of which do it ironically, and others serious, but it‚Äôs still like 1% of the actual viewers and means nothing. Just ignore it.
---
Yeah normal invites went out. I've never streamed in my life.
---
I just jumped because I knew it would look cool to the person behind me when I was suspended in the air and then faded out.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Yeah, I've seen all of that. Missed my chance with gamestop.. it was in my cart and boom... I REALLY want canadian retailers though!
---
No original mounts is bad
---
There‚Äôs like 3 different tests, the first being in like a week.
---
&gt; Again, people don't understand what's happening here.
---
I think they do, they just don't want to accept we *also* understand the issue and simply disagree with their/Blizzard's position.
---
Yes, the Classic launch is going to be a clusterfuck. That's a *feature,* not a bug. WoW's launch back in '04 was also a clusterfuck, and it's an experience most of us look back on fondly and and bond over when discussing the game we love(d).
---
**Which is the whole bloody point.** Adversity strengthens character and engenders social bonds between those who experience it together. Which is precisely why we want to back to the clunky, slow-paced, horribly-unbalanced MMO*RPG* of yore rather than the so-smooth-its-own-soul-slipped-out multiplayer online arcade action game it's become today.
---
I want Classic to be an explosive success beyond Blizzard's wildest dreams. In fact I half expect it to. And I want a whole new generation of people to try it out and fall in love with it just like we did 15 years ago.
---
That said, I want them to do that the same way we did: by experiencing everything the game has to offer, including the ugly, hairy warts. *Especially those,* in fact. Because the diamond only stands out when it's surrounded by rough.
---
I don't know how but I'm in the Beta I do have active game time but I haven't played regularly in months.
---
Your game will be ruined because there is an in-game report feature which will destroy the game.  Your post was nice though I am sorry Blizzard is a shit company.

Because what happens to server 3 when 900 of the 1000 people leave? Those 100 people shouldn't be punished for choosing the wrong server. They have to have a solution that doesn't force their players to play on a server that ends up dead. So their solution is to make 3 different versions of the same server that will eventually all be the same. I don't know how this will all pan out in the long term, but I can understand the reasoning behind it.

It probably wasn't common in actual vanilla, but on private servers there's dozens of these sorts of brain damaged people camping low level areas for upwards of 6 hours daily.
---
Got alpha for BFA, but no classic beta. I am so sad.
---
Seriously, is he looking to get sponsored by Coors?
---
No idea on that one.
---
I actually remember discussing it during AQ40 because of the huge bug pulls, I don't know why we would have been talking about it if it wasn't a thing.
---
ez downvote
---
Daze chance was reduced 1-30 by alot in vanilla, after 30 daze will happen more often.
---
This stopped me in my tracks for a bit too, as well as the lack of mana on my hunter. What the hell?

He said, without citing any sources whatsoever
---
Check out Defcamp
---
Not the reason they are removing them. The reason is much dumber than that. It's so "people don't feel forced to rush to 60 to get them".
---
&gt; We know some people are interested in them, but we don't want to put them in for a limited period of time, because we didn't want to influence people through their first leveling experience. Especially people coming back for the first time. **We don't want people to feel like they have to rush.**
---
Oh he certainly is. This isn't home.
---
Ah sry, I was actually asking about PVP not PVE in BWL gear and in Naxx gear. I would probably put Paladin and Mage in A-Tier in Bwl, and Warrior, Mage and Warlock in A-Tier in Naxx, but Im not really sure (just played hunter back in Vanilla and some Instant private server experience)

Both sides are doing the same fucking thing everybody just makes statements without any backing whatsoever and acts passive aggressive af
---
It's a month old...
---
&gt; No I mean everyone pissed that asmongold got one for example.
---
Why are they pissed about him? Not a troll just curious.
---
That's a fucking monitor
---
Hi, /u/carfo
---
Play an undead priest
---
PLEASE REPORT BUG IN THE GAME SO YOU HELP US ALL !!
---
Sounds like a bug to me.
---
After one vid i dont think i could do that..  frostianus is worse tho
---
Just to clarify, did you buy BFA as well? Or just resub to the legion patch?
---
Eh, I dont think that is fair tho. Yes, it will screw someone over but saying "prepare for a classic summer" was misleading and thats what we should focus on
---
They aren't removing them.  They aren't available in 1.12.
---
Because he is a popular twitch streamer and Johanna (holds vanilla leveling speed world record) didn‚Äôt.
---
Would you rather that they delay the release until next spring?  Or would you rather they rush out an unfinished product?  It‚Äôs ready when it‚Äôs ready.
---
I just got home a bit ago so I don't know when it went out for sure. Sorry.
---
Yes. Knowing where the fuck you‚Äôre supposed to go and what the fuck you‚Äôre supposed to do helps a fuck ton. You can get a full prebis 60 in 11 days played just by not dicking around too much
---
pretty much anything a hunter can do, a mage can do better.
---
pet helps in early solo leveling and farming, but the mage simply has more tools to deal with mobs that arent dependant on the pet. once the mage can blizzard down masses of enemies, its no contest. but both have great CC.  
---
mage can make its own food and doesnt have to worry about feeding a pet or hunting down higher levels of pet abilities.
---
dps starts about the same, but over time mage pulls way ahead of hunter.  plus portals and teleports.  plus hunter have to manage pet.  forget to turn off growl? tank is pissed. forget to dismiss when you jump down in a dungeon? please welcome half the instance as they crush you.
---
oh, and mages can kite better than hunters any day of the week.
---
It‚Äôs a polearm that was automatically put in the bags of every hunter created before a certain date when they changed survival to be a melee spec. I think it was during Legion, maybe WoD.
---
The damn thing was sold out like instantly.
---
I am in full agreeance with his points #1 and #2, #3 I understand but I dont know how I personally feel about it.
---
There‚Äôs hundreds
---
The original plan for the different schools of abilities was to actually have them need to be levelled up like Weapon Skills - for example, a Mage using Fire skills would need to use them so they developed and became more effective. This was tossed out in during Vanilla's development, but it's likely that under the hood, those "spell skills" still existed and levelled up as your character dinged.
---
During the transition from the BFA client to the Classic client, it's likely that it's not being handled 'invisibly' as it did in Vanilla. 
---
This is based on some assumptions however, so I may be completely wrong.
---
nice try activision
---
well stay tuned to the thread ;)
---
Like I said, it's the druid flash heal.
---
Healing touch is 3.5s, and rejuvenation is a HoT. Regrowth is the only way to burst heal. Hence its cost.
---
Which is also why yes, avoid it at all cost like you said. 
---
I suppose in TBC they realised there's no need to add such a massive mana penalty to a quick heal with an over-time component, because it cannot be spammed (you'll be doing regrowth+rejuvenation+healing touch).
---
its still technically in summer, yeah its late summer but people kind of got their expectations set on it being early summer without blizzard really saying anything about a release date up until now
---
It‚Äôs so interesting to look in the bags of old characters like these and marvel at the time capsule.
---
I enjoy these very much
---
But can you tell me more about the different race choices for a rogue? I really wanna know what all the unique races do since it has so much impact on gameplay and nobody else is talking about this information
---
Right. On one hand I cant blame someone for that. Gotta make a living. On the other hand it makes it difficult to know whos really genuine in moments like this.
---
Foiled again!
---
I'm not sure if they plan on restocking it but just make sure to check other sites like amazon etc. as it's not being solely sold from the blizzard store. I know it's out of stock in the UK in the moment on blizz store, amazon and Game so no idea if that's it and it's not getting restocked but on amazon you can have them alert you whenever it is back in.
---
Imp pet attack and LOS/control issues, feel slightly off.
---
Or we could look at any game subreddit in the history of this website and see that they *gain* in popularity after a launch. Every single one. (Until the hype dies.)
---
You can conjure up whatever fantasy reason you want but it's not backed by statistics. Having an actual game is the biggest publicity for a subreddit, before that huge chunks of the general gaming population just don't care.
---
My childhood
---
 could anyone link or explanation of what sharding?
---
I've been seeing it for months and I just nod like I know what you guys are talking about..
---
DAE think vanilla hard
---
yeah. im not happy about it. It was good in my cart for like all of last night. and now its gone. I dont know why they cant just allow people to preorder and they ship and continue making it until launch, then it goes away.
---
Very compelling argument :)
---
Do you suggest Troll or Undead for mage?
---
Joanas speedrun on YT is from patch 1.9 if I'm not mistaken.
---
He won the BG though. 
---
Kills + deaths is the only metric worth going by.
---
The only actual bug anyone has found, and it wasn't posted in the [MEGATHREAD](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp61yw/beta_bugsproblems_megathread_report_issues_here/)! lol
---
Absolutely, I would.
---
The fact they want you to sub for retail for a chance is some loot box malarkey.
---
Well, not op, but thanks for helping me make my choice
---
i read somewhere that you can preorder it on amazon, so keep an eye out for that possibly
---
Already bought in I'm a sucker
---
Flight points will be the same
---
It's not Classic, it's the 15th anniversary collectors edition for WoW as a whole.
---
guys its ok mobs were always slower than players, you could always regen so fast you didnt need to eat, this is how its always been, layering haha classic so good =D
---
in all seriousness, your question is if people would buy into beta if it wouldnt cost them anything? (cause they get 2 paid months?)
---
Cross realm BGs will be nice to have in classic
---
This is so wrong...
---
1. wow classic sold out, seriously?
---
2. pre order on amazon for example dont book before delivery
---
3. you mean the 15th anniversary CE...
---

At what point do you not report it because you expect they already know about it? If there was a giant statue of Garrison taking a shit on Orgrimmar left over from BfA would you still report it via the tool?

bad bot

I just find the whole "summer" thing annoying and a little bit troubling. Where I live, summer ends 31. august. Blizzard chose the last Tuesday possible for the game to still officially release during summer. The term "Classic Summer" which is a phrase that has been used multiple times, indirectly states that the game will launch while there's still a significant time left of summer left... Instead it is 5 days... 
---
Then again had I been able to jump into the beta and started testing stuff out I would have been very happy. So I guess my feelings could come from the saltmines.
---
EXTREMELY idiotic comment
---
Imagine thinking the guy who never hit 60 and repeatedly fails to remember key details about Vanilla is a "cornerstone".
---
He definitely leveraged the hype to blow up, ill give him that.

I enjoy melee the most but hate leveling warrior in vanilla so rogue it is.
---
You'd have to do it a lot to get legit banned but it is actionable. Just page a gm if it happens.
---
Yes sadly. I feel pathetic.
---
Its in
---
Geez, how much of a loser you need to be in order to worry about stuff like this, when what this person is doing or enjoys, has absolutely no effect on you in life whatsoever.
---
I twitch. I WoW for a long time. I stream.  I no get invite.  Feels really, really bad.
---
Hey man! 
---
So no changes are intended to happen outside from the original patch 1.12 of Vanilla WoW.  They are wanting to keep it as authentic as possible.  A few things I can think of that are not game changing, but are added are updated graphics, battle.net integration, and the new Interface UI.
---
yes
---
We have 25 days minimum by law (5 weeks), more than that with red days included.
---
the only changes are graphical improvements, you have an option to use the newer shadows and water quality and whatnot
---
Would cost them up front, whether or not they like the end product or not though.
---
I am 100% sure it is a bit, look at it's post history you dumb bot. 
---
Probably better that it does
---
I wouldn't be proud of it but yeah I probably would.
---
It wasn't even that esfand hit it with an auto + judgement right as asmongold hit it and got the crit. Because we only saw the damage indicator from asmon's perspective we get the appearance that it was the auto that did all that damage.
---
Sorry, my number was inflated to demonstrate a point. I do not know how many people were actually in the classic beta.
---
sold out. im marked for notify tho.
---
Mana and Health regen are way too high.
---
checked everywehre. sold out everywhere.
---
Most of them?
---
..........................
---
Yet its still sold out.
---
All areas sold out.
---
Just move to a different layer.
---
Yes, I would, but that would defeat the purpose of the current beta. Targeting a very small number of users at this stage is overall good for the end quality of the release. From a testing perspective, having large data sets this early might be actually counter productive.
---
Blizzard wants to release this to the masses for beta testing, and they will soon enough.
---
So it's pvp time then!
---
People don't say malarkey enough.
---
I was fortunate to receive an invite today.  I've been subbed since November of 2004 and I do have a stream on Twitch however nothing that Blizzard has probably noticed so no "streamer priviledge" type thing.  NA location.
---
[Here's mine](https://wowleveling.fandom.com/wiki/Dun_Morogh) if you need one

The server ( [Jubei'Thos](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Jubei'Thos_US) ) that [Joana](https://www.youtube.com/user/joana160unedited/playlists)'s troll is on was introduced in 2006.
---
TIPS OUT BABY XDDD
---
Night Elf Resto Druid. Played Horde most of my career, mixing it up. :)
---
Noob
---
Mages are the best, hunters are close. I‚Äôd consider not playing human for mage though. 
---
It‚Äôs more of a skill match up on which class is better. A pro hunter will be really good in pvp. And a pro mage will be really good in pvp. 
---
May be a little biased as I‚Äôm planning on playing mage though
---
Mages shit on warriors too, and I feel like 50% of people are considering warriors from around here so. Ez 1v1s
---
I dont understand what you are saying at all. Asmongold definitely deserves to have the beta, his content is good, and he isnt a complete sellout like towel.
---
tipsout hasn't even played vanilla
---
You visit your class trainer and pay for a respec.  Starts out at 1 gold and then gets bigger each time you do it.  I think it caps out at either 50 or 60 gold, I don't know, I never respec'd much.
---
They were in Vanilla so......
---
The difference in ranking difficulty is an inherent part of Vanilla pvp. It will be different depending on battlegroup (unless there's just one mega battlegroup...) and between the regions like EU/NA. I think any keen pvp'er from oce would take it being harder to rank up gladly if it meant we always played on pvp instances hosted in aus.
---
Cross realm BGs were in patch 1.12 which was in vanilla.
---
Shadow Bolt Warlock or Shadow Bolt Warlock 2.   
---
Sword Combat Rogue, Dagger Combat Rogue and sometimes Hemo and Seal Fate Rogue or Mace Combat if your best weapon by far is a mace.  
---
Frostbolt mage with a DPS cooldown, Basically Just PvP Frost Mage (aka Winter‚Äôs Chill Mage), Fire Mage, Fire Mage with Arcane (after BRM raids).  
---
Fury DW and 2H (marginally)  
---
Hunter fucking sucks but you bring them because items say Class: Hunter on them and they can kite.
---
Amazon sold out in the 30 minutes between being available just after I left for work and me arriving at work. It's really frustrating.
---
Is there any way to confirm this without being at home? Can I log in to my account online and see whether I have access or is it purely on the launcher?
---
Just need to know whether I need to take the arvo off to "vote"
---
???  
---
   It's literally from like 10 days ago
---
Also you can reorder your character list.
---
Classic will be the new "retail" within a year, probably best to keep it under "World of Warcraft" and move whatever they do with the current version to something like "World of Warcraft: Emerald Dream (or w/e crazy expansion is next)
---
There is some people but not that many, you can see how empty the world is.
---
Neither was the old mount system where each race had its own riding skill. Guess what we're getting?
---
Welcome to the internet, every special edition sells out instantly.
---
Wait until release and then buy it on eBay for double or triple the price.
---
Classic isn't Classic, unless everything is the same.
---
If you want "improvements"; play WoW Retail.
---
Hopefully. Chances are people will want to specifically watch one or the other, doesn't make sense to keep them mixed together.
---
IIRC if you don't respec for a period of time the price drops back down slowly.
---
Yea I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out why they did it this way.  And about making multiple accounts, regardless of having to sub after you get an invite, it still gives the person who made multiple accounts a better chance....
---
At the end of the day I don‚Äôt really care.  I‚Äôm hyped for August.
---
As a Stars fan, that Blues icon hurts.
---
Yes northern Cali beta tester here - it is 500ms the servers are hosted in EU and will be for all NA region servers on launch
---
It is correct.  It has the same chance of it being 10% 20% 70%, 13% 33% 44%, what ever collection of percentages as 33% across the board.  
---
You wanted to get technical so we are getting technical.  Normally people who like to nit pick things and be technical can actually understand something as simple as odds better than you are right now... and yet here we are.
---
Farm gold for respecs
---
Roll a second character
---
Deal with it
---
Duo leveling with a friend of mine who has tried retail but never played classic. I have logged hundreds of days played, most of which was vanilla and in BC, across both factions. So I am letting him pick our faction, much to my chagrin he has not chosen yet! 
---
If alliance, dwarf rogue as main, with a nelf druid as alt.
---
If horde, orc shaman as main, orc rogue as alt. Then an orc warlock...orc hunter afterwards. I really like orcs rofl.
---
Check out the massdrop vast ultrawide. 1440p, 2ms gtg response, 100hz with adaptive sync, gorgeous full aluminum bezels, only $550.

Here's a good idea of what wow classic will look like on it:
---
https://i.imgur.com/EJdjVSi.png
---
yes i am a beta cuck I would pay for beta
---
If your main will be a Mage why in the love of god would you roll another character to make gold
---
Hunters are not cakewalk for pve. It requires a lot more attention to manage ok dps versus a frost mage spamming 1 button
---
any idea when friends &amp; family beta invites will go out?
---
You liking him or not is irrelevant.
---
My point is that it is a popularity contest designed to get the game the most exposure and advertising.
---
How is that hard to understand
---
same
---
I mean, he has raid. He has obligations.
---
That's how limited production runs work. Blizzard underestimated demand, didn't order enough from their factory partners, and thus it sold out. Maybe they'll order more given that underestimation, maybe they won't. Who knows. It takes a while for thousands of these things to be produced. Blizzard doesn't want to promise anything if they won't be able to get more by the time the expected ship date arrives.
---
There's some that were sold wholesale to other retailers, like Amazon, which also sold out. There may be others in the future that haven't listed the item yet.
---
Good luck, or if not, rough luck for you for not pulling the trigger sooner. You'll have to wait for them to come into stock on 2nd hand markets like ebay and the like, at a premium.
---
Welcome to capitalism.
---
yes, they will, partly because i think a lot of people know exactly what they will get, wow classic is an exception in this regard because it was already available once and it could be played on private server to a similiar degree :)
---
It wasn't retarded.  It did legitimately seem like Blizzard had put some Easter eggs in their Blizzcon presentation.  I wouldn't be surprised if July 16th or whatever it was was their original target, but had to get pushed a little bit because they ran into some issues that were going to take a little more time.
---
I just got home and logged on, I did get a beta.
---
In my case, I rolled a serviceable spec that could perform both multiple roles. Some classes have that viability others don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a couple options for the class I play, warrior, for example.
---
Kargoz
---
For like $15 I would, hell no to $40 even though people payed $60 for play a demo for a week during BlizzCon
---
Been playing off and on since original launch have a current active sub but haven't really played in months
---
I think sharding has a lot of possible pros... Thing is, there are a lot of possible negatives as well. 
---
I hope it works out. Something tells me this is a decisions of greed more then anything else though.
---
I'd pay for beta 100%.
---
It does, but I WANT to say that was a BC thing. I hope I‚Äôm wrong
---
For example...
---
I would actually pay a dev $100 right now to give my account access. No lie
---
Drop-down list above PLAY button where it shows PTR and your accounts.  You'll see "Beta: WoW Classic"
---
i somehow hope they fix DM like private servers did aswell... those DM farms sound way too efficient imo...
---
Thing is i really want to play alliance mage but i HATE gnomes..is being a human mage that bad..
---
Spot on the streamer involvement and information dissemination issues. I feel like yesterday was a complete shitshow with misleading and partial info being passed around via video. A blog post by Bliz to set out everything clearly in an organized fashion FOLLOWED by the streamers releasing their interviews and adding their 2 cents (and click bait) would have been much better. 
---
As for the release date I don‚Äôt really agree. The major game release season is the fall. If anything August is early.
---
This is what I remember too.  It was free, then 1g, then 5, and went up by 5g to a cap of 50.  It dropped 5g per week you didn't use it.
---
This is true, and Blizzard would get money now. Everyone knows money today is better than money tomorrow :)
---
choose what you want.
---
troll's berserking doesnt actually add much dps if you are full health (you wouldnt even get in one more cast with the 10% increase), you would have to have taken damage to see any real effect.
---
undeads WotF and cannibalize have their uses, but more so for pvp.
---
Prove it.
---
Drop down list above the PLAY button. You'll see "Beta: WoW Classic".
---

---
Not a streamer-only bet as it turned out
---
I literally never mentioned $40 to buy-in to beta in my post.
---
I know right??
---
Not sure its a bug actually.. i did report it but there is a UI of it showing all 3 specs ‚Äúskill levels‚Äù as well in my skills/spells book area
---
It's schedule to end in phase 1.
---
As in:
---
1/6 of the classic content phases, a relatively "small amount of time" (though subjective), that is scheduled to end.
---
I'm right there with you, I love melee. Warrior is just so boring to level, to me anyway. I lose interest before I make to a level where they aren't as boring, so I can never do it.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be a collectors edition if everyone could get one.
---
Yeah, they are. It's based on performance of the server as a whole and scales up based on top performers. Basically if the population is too small, it could have terrible effects on the system.

Backstabbing while not even facing the person

Lucky day for you because I am a Blizz worker! I'll PM you my PayPal and we can get this taken care of! ;)
---
clean your monitor you animal
---
Have hard server cap limits of 2 to 3k like in vanilla?
---
I don't think anyone was wanting 10k population servers, besides a select few crazies.
---
Sharding through Elwynn forest would have been fine. After which there are plenty of places for player spread.
---
Hell no. Finding bugs and things is something that should be for free, if I had to pay for that, then I might as well just play it for free on private servers.
---
Everyone ate and drank at all levels lol.
---
I would, take my wallet
---
Fair enough, that's an interesting point. I do think that there will always be people that seek to exploit any system put into the game, (even things that existed in vanilla that we now know more about and are therefore more exploitable), but personally, if they hold to their word that they will decrease the number of layers on a server down to zero layering withing the first few weeks, it won't have a huge long term effect on the overall economy of a server.
---
It's legit criminal they didn't get an invite, yet some very questionable people did instead.  But they got them out to the "big boys" now, when they tire and stop streaming classic, they'll have more invites out for others to pick up the slack, and the cycle continues.
---
Good luck killing the redridge buzzards! :P
---
They are definitely more than leveling quests. devilsaur eye (ST quest) is a hunter dps cooldown trinket that is relevant basically forever since hunters can swap trinkets in Combat with feign death
---
I‚Äôd read your own post again
---
Yeah I was gonna say, you could just... exist in a different layer.
---
&gt; For $39.99 you could buy your way into Beta
---
MasterGun95 probs read this one sentence and then commented
---
Pservers are free, if you want to play that badly
---
Plenty of non streamers got beta invites
---
Do you mean when I'm speaking about a past event that happened for Heroes of the Storm?
---
Its fucked
---
Looks like it. And now he deleted his comments. :)
---
If no gold is being added then how does it increase inflation?
---
&gt; You liking him or not is irrelevant. My point is that it is a popularity contest designed to get the game the most exposure and advertising.
---
It's not a popularity contest. It's about having communication with the devs, and them thinking you're acting in good faith. What most likely happened is that Joana has never spoken with any of the devs, and they aren't even aware he exists.
---
Key's aren't a limited resource. Tons of 100 viewer streamers got keys. Joana failed to communicate with Blizzard.
---
This is honestly a complete non issue due to the beauty of vanilla community. I have never even heard of someone doing this on private servers and you hear about fuckery all the time if you follow those subreddits
---
This isn't a bug and you aren't in the beta
---
It needs to be compared to the rates on the demo when they reach the same levels, if it's slower it's likely the same as to when it was in vanilla considering they said it was too fast then.
---
tbh if your only goal is familiarizing with quests/class then you could just try out a pserver
---
I'll just have my buddy invite me to another layer lol. Problem solved! Unfortunately
---
You lie!

---
cmon...
---
And goblin rogues! Two horde races in the human starting zone.
---
It‚Äôs not going to complete ruin and change your experience as a mage if you play human at all, it‚Äôs just statistically mages have a slight advantage if they‚Äôre a gnome then a human. 
---
But my advice is don‚Äôt force yourself to play a race if you really do hate it, it‚Äôll just demotivate you in the long run having to look at it whilst you‚Äôre playing. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt like gnomes much either. But I feel like human mages look way too bulky and roided up. Hence why ima just go horde
---
Clearly mage, no bias. 
---
Undead for PvP and Troll for PvE
---
oof
---
And it may have it's own category when it releases. I dont see much point in splitting it now. Right now is  PR and advertising time, so it makes sense to get the biggest number you can.
---
Not all, i cant even influence my cat.
---
Some invites were random or perhaps based on previous beta testing. I tested the hell out MOP legion and BFA. May have helped or just luck.
---
Multiple people have replied to the regen threads saying they didn't eat or drink.
---
Would've been nice if the collectors edition 15th annv had beta with it.
---
Vocalizing about issues and things that we wanted is how we go classic wow, got spell batching, etc etc. I don't see why we should try and shut down discussion at all.
---
Like shooting fish in a barrel.
---
This is my greatest push or motivation to quit smoking weed. Want to be there for the people who love you the most.
---
Let's hope they report the bug =]
---
I feel like every bug video posted on twitch comes with some sarcastic title. Not talking about OP, but the title on twitch. Are people surprised that bugs are being found in a beta?
---
Haha stars are my favorite team in the west. Don't worry I was extremely bummed as well. Bishop played out of his mind but it wasn't  enough.
---
Pretty sure lag switches are bannable though.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
we just have to see what the restrictions on it are, if theres a cooldown on being transferred, if it pulls you directly out of combat, things like that. im sure it will be tested in the beta
---
there were a few things that made it sort of hideous. Firstly, Gold was sort far more scarce back then, so even guilds had to help out with respecs. Secondly, depending on the situation, it could be bit of a hike to go to your class trainer then back to the dungeon, especially mid raid.  Im not sure how either of those will  be addressed. Hopefully they'll just integrate a few quality of life mechanics such as having 2 specs with a down time you can swap into, as well as the guild perks mass summon. Those would be great additions to the 40 man raid landscape, which also  hopefully comes back full force.
---
T I E R L I S T  
---
S Tier: Redridge, STV, Hillsbrad, Felwood, Un‚ÄôGoro.   
---
A Tier: Searing Gorge, Badlands, Tanaris, EPL.   
---
B Tier: Ashenvale, 1k Needles, Blasted Lands, Feralas, WPL
---
I hope they will restrict how easy you can actually layerswap, like your inviting friend has to be close to you in order for you to swap layers. invites from another continent shouldnt change the layer immediately in my opinion.   
---
That said, i think a cooldown would be horrible if u mess up an invite and couldnt team up with your friends for some time...
---
Yea no thx. If I wanted that I would have done it by now. Not interested.
---
Indeed it does appear that way.
---

---
Is it though?
---
Yea I have been. He is literally the only one I've seen so far.
---
To add on: You have to buy battle for Azeroth for 100+ content and the allied races that are tied to that. I think you can unlock the legion allied races with just a sub though.
---
Casting on him when you have a guard targeted?
---
TIL I'm a paladin.
---
I dont like the warrior rage generation. Would prefer to start with a full bar of energy.
---
Yeah, I also agree that a cooldown can do more harm than helping. Was just spitballing ideas really.
---
Frost is my fav personally
---
The game is like 85% different in those two expansions
---
You going undead or troll mage?
---
Wanna play the demo? Pay.
---
Wanna play the beta? Pay.
---
Wanna name your character early? Pay.
---
$$$$ Surely there is some other entity than the developers behind this mess. $$$$
---
There will 100% be a cash shop in Classic. Save this comment right now and slap me with it if it never comes. It'll probably sell old TGC stuff.
---
I'm not complaining about the game. I'm complaining about the publisher. Big difference guys.
---
im on board for saying this clearly isnt a classic summer, but of course august is in summer what are you on about
---
For me, classic is released a month after I get my A+ (tech certificate) AND live with my folks (literal basement dweller here, sup) while I'm getting my education and certs, so while I'm looking for jobs in the fall I'll have aaaalll the time to pull all nighters lol
---
I do get where you're coming from, and for me personally the timing is great but after I've got a big boy job I know to be focused on progressing my life cause like it or not, I'll eventually stop playing wow for good (Im sure I've said that a few dozen times in the past decade lol)
---
Of course it doesn't , if all the life consists of is mostly playing World of Warcraft.
---
I don't post on here with the same mentality that you are assuming.
---
Presumably 2 weeks
---
Well the company is based in the United States, so they go by their seasons.  It wont be considered Summer in the Southern Hemisphere of the planet either
---
Apparently walking seems faster due to the different fov
---
Case in point.
---
aight fair enough. I don't get what some people have against pservers, but each to their own.
---
You have an odd view of the homeless.
---
They could just pay for the sub one time and just farm the gold on retail each month to pay for every month after that. It is very easy to make gold in retail wow.
---
Asmon's been talking about Classic since it was announced, and he's always been vocal about vanilla/BC. He's just a bad example of 'winning the popularity contest.' Towelliee, someone who relentlessly shat on classic until the day he got beta access, would be better example to get the point across. He's 100% worthless for Classic beta testing and is literally there because he'll show Classic to more people than someone like Joana, who could actually contribute
---
Oh, and stance dancing, meh
---
Are the potential problems that could arise from Blizzard stubbornly sticking to a debatable decision they made mentioned anywhere by Blizzard? No.
---
I mean whether you like him or not he has an audience, they will benefit from his advertisement, and community feedback, while most of us wouldn't give half as much. I'm assuming they invited people who have done beta testing and gave feedback over the years.
---
I think I've decided alliance unless some friends decide to roll horde. I'll be priest/mage and trying to join a 2-3 night a week raiding guild.
---
I think its a bit of a generational thing. I neber quite understood the appeal of watching people play video games, but to each their own. Im sure the generation abobe me doesnt understand the appeal of lots of things Im interested in. Like playing video games haha.
---
Better experience too, watching the beta so far rofl
---
Don‚Äôt put tips in the same category as towlie my dude.  Not even close.
---
Yeah maybe he shouldn‚Äôt have gotten in but towlie has been shit talking classic since it‚Äôs announcement all the way up till last week and he only changed his stance to ‚ÄúI probably won‚Äôt play it but I‚Äôm glad the others got it, I‚Äôll stick to retail‚Äù.  Only been acting like a classic advocate to get that sweet beta invite
---
Most likely troll, I don‚Äôt really like undead hairstyles in classic. And the troll racial is way better than the undead for mages
---
Just lie and tell everyone you‚Äôre resto
---
 im not saying the class is shit.   just in my experience, the hunter took more effort for inferior results, compared to mage.   if you really enjoy the hunter class, go for it. a well played hunter is always welcomed in a group, and is certainly no slouch soloing in the open world.
---
Its in now fam, play or don't. Though I suppose you could wait until they take it out in a few months.
---
There are MANY bugs that you can see clipped in Perplexity's stream
---
Really? I thought Undead were the best mages
---
Or you know it‚Äôs just them rewarding people who are currently playing and have been subbed to their game. 
---
Why would they give stuff to people who aren‚Äôt supporting them?
---
Gotta pay the piper hombre
---
I'm honestly just excited for when the initial "braindead hype" period wears off, and the fotm classic streamers and their fanbases leave.
---
People like Joana will still get their respect in the end.
---
One click looting without shift key
---
i think this whole debate is kinda blown out of proportion. layering will hopefully be there only for a short time, a time where everyone is still leveling and happy that blizzard ensures healthy server populations through a smart server-merge-like system.  
---
if the layers are 'sticky' enough (as they said they would be) it should feel like a real server without the possibility of it going low-pop after 2 months
---
Honestly out of all the people to have gotten... that moron actually got it.  Been shit talking it and everyone who has been excited about it since day one
---
he got crit by a boar + at the same moment got hit by the second boar, don't see any difference between princess &amp; the other 2 boars
---
I don‚Äôt think so, the spell cast speed increase is pretty op for mages. Maybe undeads better against warlocks, that‚Äôs about it
---
I don‚Äôt see the point, you‚Äôre just burning yourself out before the real classic on characters that will get deleted
---
How does one download/find this widget?
---
Probably something that always happened. It didn‚Äôt show up, they just need to ‚Äúhide‚Äù it again
---
Kargoz missed out? Fuck
---
I'm surprised how popular league still is
---
Lol not when the population goes down, when the population spreads out. Common dude it's not that difficult to comprehend
---
Well actually I‚Äôm wrong. Pve is troll. Pvp is undead. I did not realise this, I may change my mind to undead then
---
No it‚Äôs them giving access to people who support them not people who quit playing.
---
Screenshotted! 
---
In all seriousness I genuinely hope not. I hope they realize re-releasing their 15 year old game and gaining a healthy amount of subs satiates their money requirements.
---
This fucking sucks for me, because I was a wee teen of 12ish when vanilla first released and my dad had to make an account for me. Which then got "lost" when I started getting into my later years of school, so I could only make my own account late Wrath when I started working and living on my own.
---
Esfand?
---
i guess they never miss, huh?
---
Because that‚Äôs now how it works.
---

Press and hold on your background, press widgets 2nd from the right next to home screen settings, scroll until you see 'calendar'. Press that and it should have 3 available widgets, one of them is the countdown.
---
It live tho
---
Good
---
I'ma assume all the homeless in your country have gotten there by no fault of their own and are actively trying to get back on their feet. As for mine the majority seem to be either the mentally ill or the drug addicts, neither of which try or want to get back on their feet. Regardless there will still be people who will fleece OP for free WoW for themselves or others.
---
It was explained to me that more beta invites will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks. He might have just not gotten in the very first wave.
---
They are doing good work!
---
It took forever for OSRS to get it's own defined category so probably not
---
 #NoChanges, Classic WoW has to ruin your schooling just like it did in the early/mid 2000's.
---
Everyone always forgets about vanilla wow when they're talking about games similar to Dark Souls
---
uuh. Yea. Thats how influencers work. Thats how the world works. The issue here isn't that there are influencers. Its that Joana wasn't considered one.
---
Wow this really sounds like a forum post we would have seen in Cataclysm / MOP / WOD beta...  You guys don't like &lt;big change that will ruin server community dynamic&gt;!? It must be done. Think how horrible the alternative is. I may not love &lt;stupid change&gt; but still love wow and know I will be playing regardless xD.  (rinse and repeat until the game is awful)
---
Would you consider someone who played years and years of WoW, who has helped generate hype, recruit friends to re-sub once the game is released, and participate in game discussion to help facilitate necessary changes as someone who isn‚Äôt supporting them?
---
It‚Äôs just dangerously close to that idea of pay=benefit.
---
People complain so much about the character creation stuff... they don't realize it will probably benefit the game's launch A LOT.
---
Blizzard will use it as a metric of how many people are actually going to play on day 1, thus taking preventive measures if needed. 
---
Although I don't like the solution, I can see it will benefit all of us... I'd much rather have this pre-pick system rather than all servers be laggy and crashing on launch day.
---
While I‚Äôm not saying this is absolutely the case, an oversight like this is so easily spotted and major that one has to question how it is that it‚Äôs part of the beta at all. Especially for a 15 year old game that is still being played and updated.
---
If I equip my ‚ÄúConspirator‚Äôs Tin Foil Helm‚Äù,  I begin to wonder if this is being done on purpose so that the community can ‚Äúparticipate‚Äù in the game‚Äôs ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù and also too raise the perceived value of this ‚Äúarcheological‚Äù project of making things ‚Äúwork as they did originally‚Äù. You guys get my drift? I‚Äôm thinking that blizzard had a solid business case for the August release and this is kinda just justifying that to the public whilst also leveraging marketing through calculated engagement tactics. Either that or they really did not put much of any effort to test things internally after all.
---
If you're talking about respecing on a (bi-)daily basis, you won't. People generally just didn't play multiple specs at all. It's possible if you absolutely want to, but it's just not worth the effort. Respecing will in most cases be a permanent choice you make and keep for a week or month or more.
---
didn't they already say each continent is its own layer? So accepting an invite from someone on another continent wouldn't have any effect on your current layer.
---
Hurr durr back in my days... it was press journalists :)
---
There had been tons of teasing papers leading to the WoW beta, then to the release, then the EU release... Nothing new under the sun.
---
lol BFA has only been a talk show for the top streamers waiting for classic
---
Panser is in. Remember her? "TradeChat" who led a crusade against Vanilla and the Classic community? Yea she's in, and streaming on Facebook. Lmao.
---
only private server to get it right was gumby
---
What did you expect? Everyone on this sub has been saying how toxic streamers are to the game, I don't know why you'd expect anything different from them.
---
Wow! A bug in Beta.
---
haha layering is definitely NOT like sharding xD
---
Wow I forgot
---
Why does anybody care about this beta? Your character will get deleted so if you want to play classic just hop on a private server
---
I've seen that. I still think Joana should've been on the first wave.
---
Ill be for sure playing holy all day at least until we get battlegrounds. So i guess ill have to stock up on gold
---
Agreed, that contributes to them feeling boring. The playstyle just feels kind of slow, and I get bored. And starting with no resources to use abilities definitely exaserbates that.
---
Beta have bugs? Wow
---
So now you agree with me.
---
It‚Äôs not about beta testing, it‚Äôs about advertising.
---
Those with the most viewers (popularity) are more likely to get in over someone who is the best at speed running the leveling process and has probably done it the most times.
---
Nice chat
---
his favorite version of WoW was MoP just btw.
---
I believe they use to make you upload a file containing your specs. Now they might just be logging it when you play.
---
Well that was a cringe read.
---
Can you explain further? It is highly unlikely that this feature helps decrease lag and crashing on launch day. There is a reason they use stress tests, and beta testing for months before release. They already know what their servers max capacities will be. They have introduced LAYERING to mitigate any issues with early overpopulation. This is a way to get people to sub early, and get the $ flowing. It feels like pre ordering almost, and then you get to claim names earlier as a reward.
---
Hope the launch is smooth and there's no errors preventing log-ins and disconnects.
---
Tips is above and beyond Asmongold in the terms of meaningful content,they aren't even comparable
---
So they should only invite people who are going to play 24/7?
---
hm ure right, thats even better. they said each layer has a normal servers capacity, so i guess they will start with 2 layers, Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms. Thats 6k Population cap and they cant switch between layers, i guess they wouldnt open more than 4 layers (total guesswork here) because they have to reliable merge it into one server after a few weeks. So each continent only has 2 versions, which limits the exploitability of layerswapping a bit
---
How so?
---
Also what about vanilla night time? I haven't been watching any videos/streams.
---
Hmmph my seven yr old phone must not support variations of the widgets.
---
Because you know as well as I do that most people won't even hit 60.  Half the players will probably quit within the first couple of months and then there's way more resources than players.
---
But you didn't address the main issue, the fact you change manipulate the layers and they aren't distinct isolated "servers" could in theory be exploitable by a few players and end up ruining the market after the layers merge. 
---
There are some other minor gameplay concerns like, abusing layers to avoid big fights in BRM so you don't lose your buffs but, since it would only be the first phase; not a big deal really.
---
He didn't say everyone with a ln OG account got in the beta, he said everyone who got in the beta (besides content creators) had an OG account.
---
Squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares
---
‚ÄúI agree, think of the alternative. Thousands of players fighting over mobs with 5 minute respawn timers at all times will put the game in a deadlock. And ‚Äúmore servers‚Äù is a cop out option since a higher server number increases the chance for them to become deserted. Fucking over people with no chance of realm transfers‚Äù
---
the only reference about hp/mana regen we have are private servers which are not correct presumably.
---
I personally tell my plans just because I'm excited about it and like telling people, but I don't really have to (as long as it's pto at least).
---
I would, since I have every intention of playing Classic for a long time.
---
#How ***DARE*** you ask a question you don't know the answer to???
---
Why do folks hate on Esfand? To me his later vids seem catered to the young stream crowd however I didn't mind his earlier ones where he raided talked about Paladin etc.
---
Are you supporting them now?
---
Do you know when your friend got your email added to the list? I remember similar happening. I think I had to wait 2-3 waves once the Overwatch beta started despite the fact I was "registered" as a F&amp;F from the start.
---
Did you buy an account or win the gamble with a sub?
---
&gt; People like me who already have their friends they play with will gladly transfer off for a smaller server.
---
Well, unless you have 39 other friends who are going to play Classic it will be hard for you to raid. So lets say you and your 9 (pretty high but im ok with it) friends end up on a server that has twice the population it should. You will have to leave the guild you have currently joined in order to migrate to a different server where you dont have to queue for hours to be able to play at all.
---
&gt; On every other option there is no choice. You wait until your server dies, and if it does then you are being FORCED to merge.
---
There were free server transfers from high pop servers to low pop servers in vanilla, also in tbc and woltk. There is a middle ground between "Sharding is the only thing that adds choice" and "No choice". I still think sharding is a good idea, i just dont accept it as a solution to the problem of servers being underpopulated post launch.
---
I need a new PC too you cheap bastard.
---
Put a gif up.
---
Beta went up today, why are you salty about that?
---
Completely solvable by allowing transfers and merging realms, something they seem to find distasteful or impossible to do anymore for some reason
---
If your only definition of support is through monetary means...then yes I still support Blizzard, just not through an active BFA sub.
---
So, you're saying they could just go blindly into the launch without taking any further metrics and everything would just work fine because of layering and other measures they're taking?
---
I can tell you by personal experience that many couldn't care less about betas, and see them as a waste of effort and time since your progress gets deleted... Yes they're a metric, and yes, they will help Blizz have a more accurate picture of what the real interest in classic is... but I think it's just foolish to think they're not getting metrics out of anything they do.
---
And yes, some people who are not interested in wating their time in a beta/stress test might be interested in reserving their character's name beforehand, so whilst I don't deny they will get profit from this, I think it's a lesser evil and it overall helps them get the realms as stable as they can get on launch day
---
Tips is a leech and a big fake
---
Because Q3 doesn't give any other promises or room to read into it than the release being somewhere between July 1st and September 30th. No "classic summer" bs.
---
Even private servers ban trading gold between their servers.
---
If it's not in the TOS for WoW I would be very surprised.
---
Priest, Shaman, Druid, and Paladin are all healing classes.
---
And it's obviously okay for you to play Classic. Why the hell would any of us be able to tell you otherwise?
---

Thanks. I'm just hoping to play Classic in peace!
---
holy shit. i didnt think i got invite (because i'm just a nobody. but i did start my account Nov 2004), but after seeing your comment, i went to check in the launcher and sure enough, beta wow classic right there.
---
Just battlegroup OCE PVP and PVE servers together. If we get quiet times between 2am and 5pm then so be it.
---
That's not how I remember it, I only remember ever needing to eat or drink in levels 1-5 if I got jumped by multiple mobs. Also this seems like a really obvious issue that the designers could easily test on their running OG vanilla server, so I do not think it is likely to be wrong.
---
I think bugs are going to be a bit more niche than this.
---
DUDE SAME! I feel 14 again too, more specifically, I feel 16. T'was the game that rekt my social life, made me drop out of high school to get my GED instead, and had 2 years of uncontrolled freedom until I turned 18 and had to get a job.
---
It was glorious.
---
i was wondering if i had to play the new wow to understand it and stuff
---
Tips is reporting bugs very regulary
---
So wait, what exactly happened? The comment is delet.
---
Not in the slightest.

---
Was checking out Asmond stream and he was calling another player an idiot among other names because the player was running from a level 4 mob. What a toxic guy.
---
I think it's probs cuz they're guaranteed to play as those who aren't streamers are not.
---
I'll just tell the students it's open lab and 10 points extra credit if you leave me alone. And I'll hide in the corner leveling my toon.
---
&gt;Well, unless you have 39 other friends who are going to play Classic it will be hard for you to raid. 
---
Who says I‚Äôm going to raid?  Who says I‚Äôm going to even be at max level when layering gets turned off?  You know this isn‚Äôt retail wow where it‚Äôs raid or die right?  You can do just fine in classic without raiding.
---
&gt; So lets say you and your 9 (pretty high but im ok with it) friends end up on a server that has twice the population it should. You will have to leave the guild you have currently joined in order to migrate to a different server where you dont have to queue for hours to be able to play at all.
---
Who says I‚Äôll be in a guild?  Dude I plan one playing with two of my close friends and that‚Äôs really it.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll meet some people when I‚Äôm max level doing bgs or 5 mans but I know I won‚Äôt be at that point in the first phase. 
---
This is your issue here.  Because you probably have all the time in the world or because you are probably planning on being online everyday, you are assuming that‚Äôs what most people do.  Casuals have always, and will always be the majority of players.  Period.  Most of players like me simply do not care about the things you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
&gt; There were free server transfers from high pop servers to low pop servers in vanilla, also in tbc and woltk.

You need to go back and read what I‚Äôm writing to you because this is what I‚Äôm talking about.  I literally said free transfers if the server doesn‚Äôt go down.

They‚Äôve already said there will be no cash shop for classic and don‚Äôt intend to implement one. If it goes beyond vanilla it‚Äôs possible.
---
In fairness they didn‚Äôt have internet in Syria which is why he also didn‚Äôt know that wotf doesn‚Äôt break fear
---
Sorry man, you just repeated that it‚Äôs a metric and it helps launch day. Explain how specifically, allowing people to pay early to reserve names helps Classic WoW. Getting an ‚Äúidea of how many people will play on launch day‚Äù is not factual as there is no direct relation between how many people will play on the 27th and how many will pay early to reserve names. 
---
What in my response makes it sound like they‚Äôre going into it blindly? Do you genuinely think they don‚Äôt have an idea of server caps, players per layer, stress threshold, etc? 
---
Also why are you saying people don‚Äôt care about betas? What does that have to do with anything? Betas are used to polish, identify bugs, and refine their product before release. You said I‚Äôm foolish for thinking they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot getting metrics out of anything they do‚Äù or course they do, but not from name reservations lol.
---
Why is there a wow1 and wow2  mine only says BFA and ptr
---
Go and shave those pubes on your neck you call a beard. Then perhaps we‚Äôll pretend to listen.
---
Layering
---
Y‚Äôall over here making drama and I‚Äôm just trying to sit here and stare at my non beta invite and eat mozzarella sticks.
---
No, no I won't :)
---
You can swim through water... well Chuck Norris can swim through land.
---
I can't even afford food most days yet I make too much for food stamps and government assistance. Working full time in upstate New York, so there's definitely people like me out there who can't afford $15 a month, man...
---
...I feel sick
---
Stop supporting scalpers.
---
So can anyone confirm this is what it looked like in original vanilla? I really don't know.
---
Pretty sure that mechanic is not present in private servers hence a lot of people thinking it's reduced or non-existent. Still worthwhile asking if it's currently at vanilla levels or not though.
---
if I sub now, can I get an invite as well? I wanted to jump back into WoW anyway, so I might as well.
---
I'm not. Just telling you how the world works.
---
I mean anyone can just buy stuff from them but if it was you would send a beta invite to someone who isn‚Äôt playing the game? Someone who is playing is much more likely to test out beta then someone who has an inactive account.
---
Ahh cool, didn't get in then. Have fun!
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Does anyone know if you needed an active subscription to get selected for the beta?
---
Well if I put you in charge of Quality Assurance, you would probably prefer to have the most bang for your buck out of your testing slots. So you would probably prioritize people who would play the most to get the most free testing hours you can out of it. Maybe even do a little research to decide on who is most likely to play a ton of hours based on past surveys and hours played in recent months.
---
Something tells me this isn‚Äôt about Quality and more about marketing though. Heh
---
In previous betas, my client informed me of access before my email. I think I got an email for BFA two days after my client updated.
---
Hi, /u/obligatoryFail
---
But Q3 still takes place in summer. So people are going to hope for a Classic  Summer even if a dev doesn't say that phrase. Because of course they would, that would certainly be nice, but it's silly to expect it to line up perfectly with a school schedule.
---
i mean atleast he plays wow lol...some that got in barely play or havnt played since BFA came out and got in lol
---
This video is the reason I began to play WoW to begin with.
---
Already levelled a lot on private servers (60 on ND, etc, 1-30 routes done a few times etc) it's just private servers are riddled with bugs and inaccuracies. I'd rather just help test the real product to ensure it's bug free on release.
---
When its out of beta i'm sure it will.
---
Same here, MoP actually had stuff to do and had the best class design, plus the best content patches. MoP had the most rewarding outdoor content and Throne of Thunder and SoO were 2 of the best raids ever made and IMO Lei Shen was the best fight in the game.
---
MoP also had CM‚Äôs, rewarding still the best transmog sets in the game and the dungeon design was relatively decent.
---
Call me crazy but if you were into outdoor content and wanted stuff to do outside of raiding the expansion was great. If you liked dungeons the expansion was great. If you liked raiding the expansion was great. All this done through most of the best class iterations the game has ever seen.
---
Who is going to be okay with merging realms and potentially losing their character name? How do you decide who gets to keep the name and who doesn't? Which server name does the newly merged server get? These things matter to people. I'm sure free server transfers will exist for high population servers that don't reduce at the time p2 drops. It's not unprecedented. I don't know. I'm not an expert. I don't love the idea of layering but it's better than sharding or leaving people on eventually dead servers.
---
That's not a bad thing, at least he didn't say it was Legion.
---
Wait what? 
---
What does a beta incite have to do with anything? I never even brought that up. I fully support blizz giving beta invites to currently paying customers and content creators a like. 
---
My post is about letting people reserve names (not play the game) if they start paying sooner.
---
Running speed is due to the fov being for modern widescreen vs the 4:3 of old.
---
It's just an optical illusion.
---
Aggro range does look low
---
No it 100% is.  The dude doesn‚Äôt care at all about classic wow at all.  I guarantee this dude won‚Äôt report anything if he even plays it.  He will just try to get as many viewers as he can and more than likely will just talk bad about it like he has the past 2 years.
---
I would have 100% given it to Johanna before this dude.
---
the mana regen is actually 50% slower than on private servers.
---
You can leave your starting zone immediately without doing a single quest and then travel to another starting zone, provided you walk all the way to your capital city.
---
So the answer is level 1.
---
But your questlines would theoretically naturally align around level 10 or so.
---
I hope it makes it to live.
---
Yeah MoP was fun. The PvP in it sucked but for it being retail I enjoyed almost everything about it.
---
Because if that gold has a monetary value, it will incentivize those that want to take advantage of that new monetary value gain in a different economy that is newer / easier to take advantage of. This will create increase the amount of players farming the gold simply to sell with no intention of spending it on the sinks in game. While inflation isn't the biggest concern for me, it will certainly be contributing to it.
---
I paid to play the classic demo.  
---
So that's a yes from me.
---
ew
---
Just FYI
---
I am a long time in and out wow gamer.  Played beta for original wow and /played many days in Vanilla.  I came back for a month for BC, Legion, Wrath, Mists, and WOD.  Haven‚Äôt played since.  I‚Äôm in Beta.
---
Blizzard has selected a bigger group of gamers than just streamers for Beta.
---
It‚Äôs a database query lottery based on some key filters.
---
#lucky #excited
---
I'm in.  
---
\- Opted in around the time it was announced (did it through my Blizzard account and didn't do it through the Classic site or anything)  
---
\- No  
---
\- Active on and off since WoW's original release (was not subbed enough to get that statue back in the day)  
---
\- Played BFA for a bit at launch. Quit, came back, quit again for a long time, and then recently (like a week ago?) resubbed out of boredom.  
---
\- US  
---
\- Whenever you were able to create them for vanilla open beta because I first played then.  
---
\- Yes
---
&gt; Who says I‚Äôm going to raid? Who says I‚Äôm going to even be at max level when layering gets turned off? You know this isn‚Äôt retail wow where it‚Äôs raid or die right? You can do just fine in classic without raiding.
---
You are dodging my question, and it was ment to show you that there are players who will be affected by this.
---
&gt; You need to go back and read what I‚Äôm writing to you because this is what I‚Äôm talking about. I literally said free transfers if the server doesn‚Äôt go down.
---
And you need to read what i wrote, i said there were free transfers in vanilla without layers as well.
---
Am I the only one that find twitch streamers kinda pathetic?  Like in a sad clown on stage kinda deal.
---
Not trying to be a dick but I legit feel that way about em.  I would hate streaming.
---
His voice is so soothing.   I doubt I'm alone regarding this :D

Mob run speed is way too slow. You can actually outrun mobs on the beta. They should be about 150% of a player's movement speed.
---
Yeah, same here man.
---
Same. Then I watch a kid who clicks all their abilities also playing beta and die a little inside
---
People are saying he was doing a beta key giveaway. That would be a scam because there are no beta keys. Blizzard is adding beta permissions directly to your account.
---
Has there been word if they will even have battle groups?
---
it may have been an exploit for a short period. there was a time when people would sit in the spawn and get the honor from other people getting the points. its the reason the report afk feature was added.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
---
Hi, /u/Ferda_Waagh
---
I‚Äôd gladly pay to not download a bad server and get hacked etc.
---
Depends on how the system works. If it works like their sharding and tries to group people based on friends lists and guilds it probably won‚Äôt be as easy as just opening friends list and getting an invite.
---
In my time on BfA outside of war mode, I was almost always split with my guilds and friends list on shards. Rarely would I have to group with someone on my friends list or in my guild to see them. Maybe I just have incredible luck or w/e but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be getting invites to different layers from people on your friends list or in your guild. Unless you just add every rando to your friends list.
---
As was stated in an interview, the new mount system was put in place in 1.12 to prepare for BC and the creation of flying mounts. They deliberately made an exception to a 1.12 system because the older one was in place for virtually all of vanilla and they thought it was more authentic. One exception does not mean everything is off the table.
---
I'm really not sure what profs to go with on a priest.
---
My first impulse had been to double up with skin/herb; skinning would make the mob grinds I intend to do (Desolate/Swamp of Sorrows/Badlands) much more productive and herbalism is a leveling good prof if you can sit on the mats for a while.
---
I'd figured my endgame profs would be tailoring/enchanting and lately I've been wondering if I shouldn't take up tailoring at lvl 40ish so I can grind levels to make the Dreamweave set? I know most people say it's not optimal to take tailoring while leveling, but I figured the grind/rewards might offer some distraction once I hit that hump around lvl 40?
---
Also, since finding out that a lvl 1 banking character can disenchant items of any level, I'm wondering if I really need to bother taking it as I level on my main? Because I can just disenchant anything I find while leveling on a bank alt.
---
So I guess my gut's telling me I should take herb/skin until lvl 40, when I'll drop skinning (after having done all my planned mob grinds) and take up tailoring to get Dreamweave (also leaving me ready to grind it up around lvl 55) and then keep herb until lvl 55ish, when I'll do one big final grind and sit on the herbs until more people hit 60/we get a big content drop.
---
Does this sound like a sensible plan or do some of you have some much needed c&amp;c for me? I'd be grateful for some, please.
---
Hey, thats good. I dont care for him but that makes me happy
---
I already payed $40 for the demo access, plus bought sub time during the demo so I could use the mail and trade with people, plus bought a 6 month sub once news of the beta went out. 
---
They can go fuck themselves.
---
Thats very nice of you, I‚Äôm from a third world country, but I‚Äôm working my ass for getting a decent pc and a wow subscription before August , hope you can actually help someone in dire need of classic
---
I was under the impression classic wow was free if you already had a subscription to wow
---
TRRUUUEEEE
---
They are also inviting people with Warcraft beta selected... so maybe check both those boxes yeah?
---
You're such a victim.  I'm sorry, I should have been more sensitive.
---
The videos people posted about the interviews are the only source for "Layering" right now.
---
Everything
---
Ooh yeah that's actually kinda illegal.
---
i mean why does he need to grab more subs lol...he doesnt need more subs so saying hes doing it to grab more subs is idiotic at best...
---
and its not like classic wow and wow reddit dont take every opportunity to shit on him as well...so its not like you all have much room to talk about him being an absolute assholes if you also shit on him every chance you get
---
I wanna see the return of Athene, throw him an invite.
---
Really? Seems like a great way to discover what‚Äôs up with members of the family/friends list.
---
I'm not 100% sure on this but I saw a streamer right click or shift click an item into the trade window.  I feel like you couldn't do that in vanilla.  Prob not a big deal though.
---
I also saw green items dropped say "&lt;random enchantment&gt;" below the stats.  Don't remember that either.
---
The game did used to have a ton more skills and no talent system so maybe that‚Äôs just how they‚Äôve been hiding it for years after the rework
---
Joana not getting a pass is madness. People are still using his guides.
---
All of the World of Warcraft games got consolidated a while ago. I believe it's up to Blizzard anyways.
---
Because where I live if you're homeless its more than likely because you are either mentally ill or a drug addict, neither of which are interested in getting back on their feet or cell phones. Eitherway this is getting off the topic of OP buying WoW for the less fortunate. While sure its a commendable thing to do its utterly wasted in my opinion. He'd be better off donating money to food kitchens or said persons education so they could better themselves.
---
Both are God Tier but Mage is actually a good PvE DPS and Hunter...isn‚Äôt as good
---
It's a different story when the sad clown makes fucking tons of money.
---
Except you need to also have Warcraft selected. Cucked yourself.
---
Prophetic
---
You're right but you didn't have to call him a retard
---
I checked Asmondgold‚Äôs stream before beta went live, he was just watching videos about classic, then searching for videos that were him reacting to videos about classic. Like if there‚Äôs a whole meme about you watching videos about classic, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt do it on stream? Idk, I don‚Äôt get it.
---
can't wait for ~~pristine servers~~ classic wow
---
Let more people in to find bugs like this instead of BFA players who have never played vanilla
---
Hi, /u/ogctoastyhorse
---
you're wrong
---
Just play it. Don‚Äôt take anyone‚Äôs advice and don‚Äôt watch any videos. The less you know, the more fun you will have. Then if you wanna start raiding at 60 watch some guides
---
Random enchants were definitely in. However, from memory it didn‚Äôt explicitly say random enchant.
---
Sounds fair
---
I didn't mention that if you choose human, you get to gear for more DPS since you need less +hit. A tier 2+ combat Rogue can literally oneshot a fresh 60 clothie with sinister strike. It's hilarious actually.
---
Some streamers are okay. The dynamic is odd though. It's like being the little bro again and watching your big bro play games. It's a good way to see how gameplay is but that's about it.
---
The ones who engage and discuss the game/strats etc are fine. It's the streamers that just play and ignore their audience until they get a sub that annoy me. 
---
If tips is doing what people are claiming he's doing then that's wrong. It's dismembering what his fellow classic enthusiasts have worked for. But I'm not the biggest fan after seeing him roll need on the defias chestpiece and claiming he can use it more over a hunter and rogue... both who were in his party.
---
that's private servers yo lol, people have been trading gold in wow since the beginning of time. I know too many people whove traded gold and never gotten banned.
---
a silver lining there is that it was tested and found on beta that instance resetting macros paired with /camp won't teleport you to the instance entrace like it does in private servers. So dungeon farming might be less powerful overall as you won't be able to teleport to entrance for quick reset.
---
Behind Chuck Norris' beard is just another fist.
---
it says its the original video re uploaded, I'm not sure. I tried to find the very original one but all the came up was this one.
---
&gt;Edit: Anything you guys want me to test first?
---
How much reputation do various quests give for your faction? Does there appear to be "spillover" rep, where finishing a quest for Stormwind also rewards a tiny rep increase for other Alliance factions?
---
I honestly don't understand why you even bring up server caps and players per layers as something that matters. They absolutely know how much a single realm can handle, and absolutely know how many players per layer they will be able to hold smoothly... Now explain, how does that give them any insight on how many servers they will need and how big the audience really is?
---
" there is no direct relation between how many people will play on the 27th and how many will pay early to reserve names" - This is plainly false... There might not be a 1:1 relation, but there definitely IS a relation. You will not get the same amount of people reserving their name if there is a million people interested in classic than if there is just 100 thousand.
---
"Betas are used to polish, identify bugs, and refine their product before release" - Yes, thanks for clarifying what beta means... now explain why it's useless for them in estimating their audience size. Will you tell me they don't use metrics as how much % of a population actually takes part in these things, in order to extrapolate an aproximate of what their full playerbase will be?
---
" but not from name reservations lol. "- Do you have a source for that? As far as I am aware, companies even take fan site engagement as a metric for their estimations. Why would they not cross the numbers of their name pre-pick with all the other data they got in order to make a better guess?
---
I really just need some clarification... so I get classic wow on release just for being subscribed to wow already?
---
What?  I‚Äôm not dodging your question.  The topic was people who don‚Äôt care to make new friends and just play with the ones they have, like me.  And you said it‚Äôs going to be hard to raid without making them.... that‚Äôs not dodging your question I‚Äôm answering it.  Not everyone raids.  Do you understand that?  If you do then that‚Äôs your answer lol wtf how hard is that to understand.
---
And the players who would be effected by that DONT HAVE TO LEAVE THATS THE POINT IM TELLING YOU.  If the server gets full and you have made roots, then don‚Äôt leave you dumb dumb, there will be more people on that server who don‚Äôt care about that stuff that will leave and level out your server. 
---
&gt; You need to read what i wrote, i said there were free transfers in vanilla without layers as well. So layering does not add anything.
---
What??? Yes it does man lol.  It makes it so we don‚Äôt have to have three times as many servers.  And with just free transfers that‚Äôs not going to stop from your realm dying because there won‚Äôt be enough total people to populate the servers that were created on day one. 
---
You gotta understand what every piece of this is doing before you start discussing things like this with people dude.
---
Its not their fault, thats just how Blizz does it. They did the same with Overwatch closed beta. All the "influencers" get in, along with a few randoms. It sucks, but it makes business sense. No need to hate on them though.
---
Yeah, it was not explicitly stated; I did not know they were random until I saw two items with the same name, but different stat bonuses.
---
His voice makes me want to hurt myself.
---
SeriousGaming did as well...disgusting.
---
Noooope. Nope nope nope. There is exactly one circumstance (other than your raid being a collection of derps) in which an arms warrior can be near or at the top of meters in a raid, and that is if they are Horde, have Bonereaver's Edge, and have windfury totem.
---
2H is completely nonviable on alliance and is barely viable as Horde if you're guaranteed a windfury totem. And that's as Fury. And on pservers in which glancing blows are coded more favorably than they were in vanilla, which benefits 2h/arms more than other specs due to sword spec and windfury rage loops.
---
Does it have the Beatles at the start? I'm pretty sure it gets copyright striked straight away on YouTube for that, or it used to atleast. Will have to check it out after work.
---
I don't know what to believe. The comment could have been deleted to be censored, or it could have been deleted because it's false. You'd think tipsout would be a decent human being and know why that's wrong.
---
it is blizzard server, literally everything is blizzlike even if its wrong
---
You can leave any time though the journey will be treacherous. Going from Darkshore to Ironforge was a right of passage for lowbie nelves on my server.
---
If you, for example, wanted to ride a horse as a night elf (or cat as a human), it's a good idea to go to elwynn forest ASAP. And you'd want to get there as low a level as possible as at a certain point above a quest's level range you stop gaining as good reputation. Which will make it much harder later on.
---
They need to let soooooooo many more people in.
---
Good use of the post-Cata Jaina meme
---
Adults who can't afford $15 likely can't afford the computer, internet, a whole lot of other real life expenses. They should be paying off debt and working full time instead.
---
you're right it does change the vanilla experience. and? it's for one phase *at most* and it is absolutely necessary for launch.
---
you are implementing something that exacerbates launch problems. instead of 2 people per mob, now you have 6. or 9. or 12. that's not the vanilla experience and it never was. that's a broken game.
---
I can't decide if I only want to put all my time into one amazing character or spread my time to two
---
i mean he has always said that retail would come first lol...if funny the amount of hate he gets on here yet you all are worse...time for some of you to grow up and move along
---
oh yeah man calling a guy an idiot in a video game what a horrible person
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/TawdrySavoryPheasantTheRinger](https://clips.twitch.tv/TawdrySavoryPheasantTheRinger) 
---
Higher lvl mobs dealing 2 damage
---
&gt; And the players who would be effected by that DONT HAVE TO LEAVE THATS THE POINT IM TELLING YOU.
---
NO THEY DONT HAVE TO BUT IF THEY DONT THEY WILL BE FORCED TO SIT IN QUEUE FOR HOURS TO BE ABLE TO PLAY. THE SAME GOD DAMN SITUATION WE WOULD BE IN IF THERE WERE NO LAYERS.
---
SURE YOU CAN JUST JUMP SERVER HOWEVER THE FUCKING MUCH YOU WANT, BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AS WELL AND THEY MAY NOT WANT TO JUMP SERVERS - BUT THEY ALSO DO NOT WANT TO SIT IN QUEUE ALL DAY. A SITUATION THAT WILL OCCUR EVEN IF WE HAVE LAYERING AT LAUNCH. SO ALL IM SAYING IS THAT LAYERING WONT SOLVE THE PROBLEM, EVENTHO IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS SUBREDDIT THINK IT WILL.
---
Didn't get in &gt;.&lt; man that's soul crushingly disappointing. Was hoping to get home and help blizzard improve the game. Nothing left to do but  wait till August.
---
Honestly, of all the nu-WoW expansions, MoP was the best byfar IMO. It doesn't stand up to pre-Cata, but I think it was pretty damn good
---
First zones like Elwynn, Dun Morogh, and Durotar have SLIGHTLY lower than player movement allowing for lower levels to escape a little easier. (Also enemies outside those zones have more like 110% movement, not 150%. That's ridiculously fast)
---
Is that still the case outside the first zones?
---
They're not in. I ran around the whole world. No true night time either.
---
Have you ever preordered a game???
---
I mean I guarantee almost 100% of us have.
---
Consider it a preorder bud, and quit whining about them giving us a great game back
---
Works great for Runescape / OSRS
---
Nobody wants to watch RS3 is the equivalent to how you guys wouldn't want to watch Retail or "Modern".
---
White swing hit chance doesn't differentiate between offhand or mainhand. If you have a 2h or a single 1h weapon your miss rate will be 5% against same-level mobs, if you have two 1h weapons your miss rate will be 24% (i.e. +19%). Those go up to 8.something and 27.something against +3/boss level mobs. Yellow hit rate does not change based on your weapon setup.
---
Blizzard will help with it if the community wants it... Just make it known.. I believe it's a great idea!
---
Watch Athene‚Äôs old videos for all the Holy Pally info you need.
---
I‚Äôm not calling him a horrible  person. I curse to myself when I play games. I just despise people people that curse at others.
---
Yah I like seeing the dnd-esk styled in here like some of the armor or creatures
---
You're kinda supposed to steamroll it. It doesn't save you from drinking every 3 mobs as a caster further, just watch those streams when they get to the bigger zones.
---
Soul link warlock
---
The simple solution to that is use an email and password solely for private servers. People only get hacked when their emails and passwords overlap with other things.
---
I was actually only commenting with knowledge based on Elwynn. Apologies if this is the case, then! I thought they still had 150.
---
This is a bug, imo. All it used to say was ‚Äúyou are now level 15
---
Your strength has increased by 1
---
Your agility has increased by 2
---
Your stamina has increased by 2‚Äù
---
What race should i be as a SL warlock? Human? They are good for world pvp to?
---
Also you could tell in 0.3 seconds whether that warrior was going to delete you instantly cuz of what his gear looked like.
---
The og.
---
I put in for a few days off around release, don't know if they've been approved yet.
---
Hey some things are more important.
---
You can only have human or gnome warlocks in classic.
---
Edit: on alliance side of course
---
Afaik, warlocks are the top of the foodchain.
---
nah the guy who reuploaded it had to swap the beatles out cause of copyright like you said.
---
Thanks so much! I'm working on a holy build as we speak
---
literally everyone that matters knows that twitch chat should be ignored.
---
That's great. Any idea how long it took, overall to hit max level? How long do you think it took you to reach the point where casual raiding might have been possible?
---
Indeed I have, but not since something like modern warfare 2 or something equally dated. Another one of my responses compares it to a preorder. 
---
How in the fuckin world do you equate not approving of paying early to reserve names to whining about getting a great game back? I fuckin love vanilla wow and am stoked to get any version they choose to release. What I‚Äôm not stoked on is small pay to gain advantage situations like this.
---
Rogue, Hunter, Mage, Warlock are all solid if played and geared properly.
---
Because it appears on their thumbnail in twitch which makes it seems they‚Äôre playing classic to attract more viewers.
---
There are going to be *thousands* of bugs reported by people that only have pserver experience and think it's authentic vanilla. That's the biggest hurdle Blizzard have to cross with this beta.
---
Thing is i used to want to be a mage but people say human mages are trash compared tp gnome mages. Im wondering if its the same with human locks vs gnome locks?
---
What about servers that dont have 2/3 of the population drop off after launch?? Like thats extraordinarily unrealistic haha
---
K I'm downloading it and reshuffling the music back to normal for my own viewing pleasure, without yesterday, it's just not the same.
---
Seriously, this is the most bizarre thing I keep seeing discussed regarding layering. Devilsaur mafia guilds, farming exploits, and the like. The server will not be flooded with resources because the server's layers are scaled to its population and where that population is located. By the time high-level gathering materials become relevant, there will probably be a maximum of two layers. And it will still be scaled to population, i.e. consumption. People shouting 'this will ruin the server's economy' has got to be some of the most facile nonsense I have ever seen in this subreddit, which I think we can comfortably agree is saying something.
---
They recognized a problem (launch, tourists) and at BlizzCon they said what their plan was to address it. Then they decided that would feel too inauthentic (poofing, cross-server) and *designed a new solution*. They did not go back on their word.
---
They sometimes do emails.  I got one just now, it's how I found out.
---
Someone was able to install a legion-patch recount, I heard
---
Also Battle of Dazar'alor race, also Crucible of Storms race
---
Wait wait wait wait wait.
---
Are you saying....that people would LIE....on the *internet*?
---
*surprised pikachu face*
---
Could quest with him at level 1.  If you‚Äôre waiting for a ‚Äònatural‚Äô place where you might find yourself in the same zone without any extra effort on either of your parts then possibly Wetlands... 
---
You‚Äôll probably actually want to hit Westfall for Deadmines, so maybe that‚Äôs your ticket.
---
Who the hell want them in shit stain aspect ratio? lol

I‚Äôm using WoW classic to play completely different. I was always a horde player and never touched the alliance scum... so ‚Äúfor the alliance!‚Äù. I‚Äôve also always played a support role so I‚Äôm rolling Mage. My alt can be a support but I want a fresh take on WoW and I‚Äôm so excited.
---
Orc is amazing for that stun resist against rogues, otherwise gnome for alliance
---
Idk that people are exactly saying its hard, simply that it requires more patience and planning, which is something that those of us playing retail arent exactly used to.
---
Could be the point to lower the initial load on the server
---
Yes you do. That‚Äôs exactly how it works.
---
Did you even read the thread title.
---
I mean to be fair, you shouldn't be able to cast backwards in BFA either.
---
Heck the game still does hide them. In BFA after DCing in a mercenary mode BG and somehow ending up at my hearthstone location I saw all my weapon skills increase to some amount, I dont remember the number tho...
---
so idiot is a curse now rofl
---
You can't read. It says "forming A hundred person raid".
---
What even is the beta for lol this stuff has been around for 20 years now. Did they remake it from scratch?
---
Honestly I was thinking about how I could totally write a paper about the beginning and progression of WoW Classic's economy. Pretty sure there have been studies done in the past about WoW's economy.
---
If they could do that and didn't get any errors then there just might be hope! Being able to test means we'll have some working addons on launch.
---
Consider this though - Blizzard are the only ones that actually have a working 1.12 client as it was back in 2006. I am pretty sure some of the very first things they checked, especially after the BlizzCon demo feedback where mana/hp regen was busted, is the actual true hp/mana regen values. They are the only ones that have the right numbers.
---
For min maxing gnome wins. For pvp escape artist is more useful than better stealth detection. Also, some people have a harder time clicking on gnomes.
---
But does it tell you where mankriks wife is?
---
# LAYERING IS LITERALLY FUCKING JUST SHARDING. IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WORD
---
I feel like I'm taking CRAZY PILLS WHAT THE FUCK
---
It‚Äôs nice to hear that you‚Äôre working your ass off just to get your ass ganked the shit out of in STV. I admire that. 
---
Focus on getting that decent pc. And drop me a DM. I‚Äôll help you out on the sub. üôÇ
---
You are paying HALF a months sub to essentially ‚Äúpreorder‚Äù the game.  Its genius.  It shows them how many people will be playing on each server BEFORE they launch.  If this bothers you I hope you can try to forgive them of the world ending fallacy
---
Pick paladin if you want to have easy group and raid spots. Pick one of the other ones if you want to have fun.
---
Why do you care what happens in other layers. Im not sad because a raid happens in a different server I'm not in.
---
Yup, you're a crazy person.  
---
Backstab on live doesn't work the same as it did in Classic.  It's just a bug with range and facing.  Easy to miss if you're just fighting mobs and leveling, because mobs always face you, and unless you're actually backwards trying to fit it, you wouldn't notice this.  
---
This is why they need people testing and pvping/dueling which may not be happening as often in their internal tests.  It happens.
---

This is my first time making one of these, enjoy!
---
No.
---
Not going to get into the semantic meaning of what cursing is. He sounded toxic to me by berating another player that's all.
---
Totally agree. MoP was a lot of fun. I loved my disc priest back then, doing all the CM¬¥s for the extra teleportation skill and transmog. Also SoO and in particular Garrosh was imo the best raid/encounter i ever played in WoW (i play since wow beta).
---
Ofcourse the xpac had also huge problems like crossrealm raiding, shit ton of phasing, shared raid ids... but that doesnt mean MoP was bad. Alltogether it was imo one of the better Addons for sure.
---
Joana isn't in their pocket, why would he get special treatment
---
Got in and I am a very normal person.
---
It's an old account, I played from the original Beta up through WOTLK.  I then stopped playing for many years (skipped Cata, Mists, Warlords expansions).  Came back at the very tail end of Legion, played a couple months of BFA at launch, then took another break.  I re-upped this last Sunday to kill time before D3 S17.
---
My favorite episode of south park
---
Interesting take on it! That would have me rolling Mage as well because I've never played one past lvl 10 (just never got around to it).
---
Leaning me towards Mage :P
---
Wait so now you‚Äôre complaining about q times?   Dude what fucking world do you live in where you expect no downsides to this??  There‚Äôs probably going to be q times on launch day too.  You really expect there to be no fucking q times? What an entitled piece of shit you are man lol.  A couple days of q times till it levels off... OH NO CALL THE FUCKING COPS DUDE.
---
 And are you honestly comparing a q time with the remainder of who left after launch to the q times of launch day?  Dude you can‚Äôt be this fucking stupid.  The q times at launch without layering would literally be over a day long.  With a 1k q it might take an hour or two at max for a couple days...And this is the WORST case scenario where a server has not as many people leave.  Get out of here dude you are still playing in the little leagues on this subject.
---
&gt; SURE YOU CAN JUST JUMP SERVER HOWEVER THE FUCKING MUCH YOU WANT, BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AS WELL AND THEY MAY NOT WANT TO JUMP SERVERS - BUT THEY ALSO DO NOT WANT TO SIT IN QUEUE ALL DAY. A SITUATION THAT WILL OCCUR EVEN IF WE HAVE LAYERING AT LAUNCH. SO ALL IM SAYING IS THAT LAYERING WONT SOLVE THE PROBLEM, EVENTHO IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS SUBREDDIT THINK IT WILL.
---
This whole thing is literal fucking gibberish my dude. 
---
I‚Äôm going to pick this apart from what I think you were trying to say because it seems you aren‚Äôt smart enough to actually express what you meant.
---
If the issue, now, is q times... (which this is the first time you are bringing it up so nice moving the goal post dipshit) layering will make it so given the worst possible scenario the q times will be way less harsh than they would be without it. 
---
Let‚Äôs say there happens to be 7k people per server.  With layering q times would be minimal and worst case scenario if not as many people who left this one server, you‚Äôll have a couple days if not a week of q times while the transfers transfer off.   Without layering you will have day long q times every single day until people leave the game and then they add in transfers until other servers dwindle down.
---
Bud you‚Äôre just not very up to date with what these things do.  Just leave it at that.
---
It's not about people "leaving the server", but rather the same people just playing less, after the launch rush. The first few weeks people will be using sick time and paid time off from their jobs, and may make some social and sleep sacrifices, but after a few weeks that should die down.
---
The important distinction is that server pop caps are not "active players", they're "concurrent players".
---
Well, if you rush too hard you'll have to wait for Dire Maul to open for the Dreadsteed
---
Its beta, not early access.
---
man the hating in here LOl..."if he even plays it" he played it from the time it launched til he had to raid and is going to play it after his raid....
---
the guy doesnt need to get more views lol its a WOW game and he has been a cornerstone of Wow for a very long time...ofcorse hes gonna play it...
---
meanwhile toweliee is back to playing retail wow two hours in.
---
Hmm, I'd definitely rather have fun. Paladin always seems like the one I'd like tho, but maybe the version of Paladin in Classic may not be the one I'm used to on Retail.
---
Screenies of night? Cant of course screenshot a lack of rain. No rain has to be a bug though, rain exists on Retail and back then
---
&gt; rewarding still the best transmog sets  
---
Lmao just stop.
---
Just for reference:
---
I'm not a streamer, have no public social media identity   
---
I have an active subscription, though I activated it last month just for the chance at beta   
---
I never bought BFA   
---
Haven't played seriously since Wrath   
---
Was a launch subscriber   
---
Looking forward to this so much!  This really is the best looking Vanilla WoW there is, and I'm so happy to get back to official mechanics.
---
You should make a donation pool to help you out. I'd gladly donate to help out. Like to feed an African child for a year type of thing.
---
Nice now that's stuck in my head...
---
Eh. Prob not. I want the real thing
---
you rank against your own faction not the opposite...
---
Communicating the point of your video via /say chat bubbles is as classic as it gets. It could only be more classic if you compressed the video beyond the point of being able to read them.
---
Troll Mage
---
Troll Shaman
---
Night Elf Druid
---
Gnome Warlock
---
Lol...
---
Day 1 account, currently play BfA very casually.
---
Wich brings me back to the thread title. I hate gnomes.
---
Hi old fren! I'm Smldonkey, god damn i miss those days. I got bene/anethema with a guild prior to Knowledge...I cant remember the name at all tho. Can we all play classic again plz, ty!
---
The shitting (From the Classic Sub) only began when he changed his tune and tried to get cozy with the people here after mocking/insulting us due to our wish to play Vanilla WoW.
---
And seeing as Subs are more or less related to views i'd say that every Streamer that does it as his/her "Main" job will pretty much need all the subs they can get unless they have another source of income.
---
Because sooner or later you will lose your old subs/viewers which means you will need new ones.
---
It's not compressed, still getting processed by youtube ;D
---
Should've waited 30 min after upload to post but I was too excited.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs an exploit if I‚Äôve ever seen one
---
thats awesome!
---
Roman or Ryan, if you're reading this, Smldonkey is back!!!!! hmu boyz!
---
Then merge them 4Head
---
I know it was in OG
---
Yeah it took way too long
---
Nope
---
You can call it hating all you want.  The dude shit talked this game and the fans of the game out of nowhere for 2 years.  But now I‚Äôm suppose to like the guy?  Lol gtfo out of here.
---
Oookay, that's pretty rad.
---
It would be cool to see a side by side aesthetic comparison to classic and vanilla.
---
OMFG ANNEX, THAT IS THE GUILD I WAS IN... after all these years I finally remember.... Much love for those days, my old toon was Smldonkey. I still remember the Bene/Anethema quest
---
why would they increase the price by so much
---
Hello kitty island adventure might be more your speed
---
Parry haste reduces the time to your next attack by 50%.
---
Did they fix the stealth animation from Blizzcon?  Undead rogues  legs should move really slow when stealthed and not super fast like retail
---
Don't worry about it. You don't need to min max. And escape artist is kinda meh for warlocks anyways. Getting stealth detection is neat too. Go for human.
---
Same, i was so into the game at that point, was a beast ass healer too yall missed out :P Smldonkey 4 lyfe
---
Ouff. Thanks for this post.
---
Went to check a swedish webstore and could book a box! Actually legit happy.
---
Couldnt afford it right now and was bummed when it sold out so fast but here I have the optipn of paying &amp; picking up in the store.
---
Hype :)
---
Hi, I'm Smldonkey
---
Can you please test the different graphic settings to see if the FOV (field of view) changes? Like maybe the "Classic" button in the settings.
---
Before I laugh, is this some sort of spinal thing or is this by choice?
---
Do I really need a /s?
---
Aww hope you got a nice shelf to put that on :)
---
Indeed!
---
i never said you had to like the guy but if he really did shit talk the game and the fans...you are no better than he is for shit talking him...i mean what good does it do? 
---
and why cant someone change their mind about something once they see what it looks like???
---
In vanilla an optimal group would be warrior, priest/druid, and the non-hybrid dps classes for DPS (probably rogue/hunter if you're running with a priest, mage/warlock if you have a druid healer, to avoid too many issues distributing loot)
---
Alternately everyone goes druid/rogue and you can do just about any 5-man content with the added bonus of stealth runs. But that might be my fond memory of rogue/druid stealth LBRS runs lol 
---
Ultimately though, just do what's most fun.
---
Mop pvp at the end of the expansion was the most balanced it has ever been while keeping class variety somewhat.
---
Could be Mandella effect, but I remember mobs before level 10 being slow and 10+ they'd run faster.
---
Not my proudest fap....
---
I've got 2 accounts that have been since vanilla. I doubt it works like the theory.
---
I would hardly call retail WoW a failure...
---
Why Facebook????
---
Classic is money in his wallet. He's gonna play it just because he'll get fat checks
---
He hasn‚Äôt lol he was doing this shit literally last week my dude
---
For me this would be like watching the clock. It's going to take an eternity if I'm constantly updated about how many days are left lol.  
---
Not saying it's not a good idea, it's awesome. It just sounds like torture to me.
---
Or, you know, people that played Vanilla and BfA.
---
You can still chill in gold shire
---
Too far? We didn't develop wow and let it devolve into the state it's in now. We wanted classic so we pushed for it and now we have it. We took it so far we can actually play the game we want to play. Sounds like a win to me.
---
I sub on and off since vanilla, but wasn't subbed until before beta lol.
---
Although if you take what everyone's saying into consideration, only people of notoriety could reasonably suspect an invite.
---
Rest has been very random.
---
To be fair...BFA has been total shit
---
Tips and esfake both were just upset they weren't in the closed testing groups. Two weeks ago myself and 3 others told them in their stream about it and provided screenshots of it in game and they said it was fake lol. Oh look beta and release date that we stated was correct after all.
---
Not sure I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs getting paid to host there or something ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
There was an old school spot for years, but it was empty until the steamers started moving over.
---
99% of Paladins in Classic are Flash heal spam bots who also have to deal with a cumbersome buff system. There's some fun to be had if you focus on pvp, but then you'll have a pretty damn hard time finding groups.
---
any reason why there is nobody around lol.  
---
I been watching different streamer playing the game and there is not a single soul walking around .
---
Yeah dude! You take no damage, and you can cast/attack with your back to the target. Thankfully we have the best of the best in game right now testing and sending multiple bug reports instead of testing out their level 1 to 30 speed running route.  
---
Looking to be the best re-release in video gaming history.
---
My second friend who was also played day 1 just checked his email and he got an invite around the same time.  They're both playing right now.
---
Work on a farm long enough and you're bound to pick up habits.
---
if you hear the explanation right after, you'll see he is talking about layering, but refering to it as sharding
---
It has nothing to do with twitch, the company has to tell twitch and give them assets.
---
I see, I'd rather make sure I'm having fun all the time rather than some of the time!
---
Don't you fucking tell me about patience and planning until you leveled a warrior in Elwynn Forest! Those... those murlocs. Awful. So awful. 
---
You think Dark Souls is hard, boy? You haven't felt fear until you're trying to bandage and MRGLLRGLRLGRLGLRLGLRLGLRLGLLLL
---
Maybe if someone can't afford Classic WoW they might want to rethink how they're spending their time? Maybe by not playing MMOs?
---
And  classic wow will bring him more viewers and money. Hopefully he sticks to his guns because if he starts playing classic full time then he would be what we would call a sellout.
---
https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=717 Classic devs disagree with you
---
CDC studied, what was it the Hakkar pet bug, to see how disease spreads through a population.
---
Isn't he in jail?
---
Pservers actually had faster regen than vanilla. According to TipsOut at least, he said thats what the devs said. Might have been only regarding mana though, not sure.
---
Uh mom I'm sick... Cough cough
---
I played wow for almost a decade and didn't play the last couple expansions. Why should I not get in because I don't like the new expansion that is nothing like classic. I would rather people that enjoy classic get invited than just people who play bfa.
---
I had a guy whine to me in Discord over how unfair it is that he didn't get a beta invite despite playing since launch.
---
Dude... If you see this here: You have not been subbed since WOTLK despite you claiming otherwise. You have no characters above level 80 and you damn well know that, so don't act surprised that you did not get an invite.
---
That's all.
---
This, it was there since almost release but no one used it
---
When I was a kid I would do this in my house, you can move really fast like this, it was always a good time
---
Yea, they started with the BFA client and worked backwards to Vanilla. There's lots of stuff that still needs to be fixed.
---
You just now got an invite?
---
If I had to cut into my food budget to play WoW, my first priority would be bettering my lifestyle by finding a better job or going to college. Jesus fucking Christ. People need priorities, but instead they're living in veritable neckbeard nests while in denial.
---
You just saw that you had an invite or literally just got it?
---
yea and classic seems like the same thing
---
We‚Äôre not preordering the game. There‚Äôs no risk of not getting a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of the game. That‚Äôs why all preorders are scams now. It‚Äôs all digital downloads. Preorders were a thing because they weren‚Äôt sure how many PHYSICAL copies they would need to distribute. It‚Äôs a money grab man. If they wanted to create data without making people pay early, then your point would stand.  
---
Your tone sounds like ‚Äúhey man a WoW token is only 20 bucks!‚Äù
---
Wanted: Someone to go back in time with me.
---
I mean, the alternative to that would be having more servers with lower population - and then having to merge them a later if/when people quit. Not sure which one is better, either. But I can see how layering could lead to massively overpuplated servers if people don't stop playing.
---
and he also got to play it last week...i mean someone can hate something till they get their hands on it and then like it...i mean unless once you say one thing you can never change your mind lol
---
Ah yes, clearly thousands of people forming one single raid with one hundred people, that's what he meant.
---
You can not swap weapons while casting. 
---
In vanilla you could swap items WHILE casing and Equipping weapons/offhands would not cancel your current cast.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.4.3 \
---
Under General,  line 10
---
Equipping an item will now cancel any spell cast currently in progress.
---
I still have nightmares about this. "Okay, the plan is to pull that one on the far right.... OH SHIT THERE'S 30 OF THEM....RUUUUUNNNNNN!!!!"
---
but theyre not sending emails man
---
No he mocked a guy on stream for not using undead racial vs sgeep.
---
half his stream he's bragging about his huge level 8 warrior crits - its pretty obvious that a lot of what he says is in jest. (including calling someone an idiot for running away)
---
An aq40 geared 60 is not gonna waste their time camping a grey lowbie. Most of them wouldn't even bother dismounting to kill you.
---
My invite came around 10:45 pm eastern time. I played vanilla as well and raided.
---
For whatever the conspiracy people say, it really comes down to it is what Blizzard decided. Nothing more. AS to their internal reasons. Everyone has a conspiracy.
---
* Opted in yesterday
---
* Not a content creator
---
* Sub has been active for a week
---
* I got to level cap during launch week, unsubbed until now.
---
* US

* 11/23/2004
---
* Yes
---
I have 4 accounts on my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) that are from Vanilla. 2 from early vanilla and 2 from late vanilla. I have subscribed and played every single expansion. Was subscribed full time from vanilla through cata. Started fading in MoP and am now essentially only playing the beginning and end of expansions. No beta yet but maybe one day
---
Just got the email at 7:45pm Pacific time.
---
If there's at least 3 of you all then there's a good chance you'll have a good group as long as you each pic a different class. If you want the option of either healing or tanking that Druid is your best option followed by paladin, Paladin is a better healer but it's much more difficult to tank with, and paladin tanking at max level is not the norm.
---
Races don't matter that much as long as you guys stick to the same faction, I'd recommend just pick the race you all like the most, then meet up in an agreed starting zone since you can usually just walk to another races starting zone.
---
Holy shit, you sure do love to pick and choose what part from a comment you answer to without taking in the whole context.
---
Its impossible to have a cohesive conversation with you when you cant understand what im saying.
---
* People will have to either leave a server they have cultivated friendships on OR they will have to stay on an overpopulated server.
---
* These are both problems, problems that this subreddit think will be solved by layering.
---
* I am saying that layering wont solve these problems.
---
Yes they are. Received email that I am in beta and then checked the client.
---
Druids don't have cat form any more? What the hell?
---
Emails are always delayed. You likely had it as of 3PM Pacific and just didnt check launcher.
---
The people asking for the money to reserve names disagree? Shocker. There could be a way to do it without making people pay for a period of time in which they can‚Äôt play the game they‚Äôre subbing for and still acquire server interest info.
---
the right clicking trade window thing is a QoL change you should just point out the bugs that affect the gameplay and content.
---
its pointless and inconvenient to remove that QoL change just to exactly match vanilla WoW
---
I downloaded the app today. Any idea idea why I can't get the classic login screen live wallpaper to work? The first one that pops up.
---
stink pig
---
cross realm bgs are battlegroups
---
But they are.... they don't give you a link but they let you know you got the invite.
---
That's a 50 dkp minus.
---
I'm just making note of differences i see between the beta and the actual original vanilla WoW.  Not saying it's important.
---
Also, something something slippery slope.
---
They could charge $399.99 and plenty of people would buy in.
---
True, I'm still at work right now. Dying to get home.
---
I mean take a look around this subreddit and most of them said they didnt get an email. I guess this is new info.
---
No. I‚Äôm not their bitch
---
F
---
Don't do Tips dirty like that my man. Love or hate his content the dude is extremely passionate about Classic. Towellie just panders for views even if he's shit all over the game in the past (which he has with Classic)
---
I'm pretty sure no one will get that, can you rephrase ...
---
Making people beg and give their information so that you can judge whether they're worth giving money too... yuck. Just donate to a charity. This is gross power tripping.
---
That is how I know you‚Äôre missing the point of this. 
---
How personal is a name? You get that just by adding people up on Battle.net ID. 
---
It is merely a way of communication so that I may address them appropriately with whatever little human touch we may give off over the Internet. Instead of ‚Äúoh hi noobmaster69. Here‚Äôs 6 months of WoW sub.‚Äù 
---
And my point is proven because no where did I ever ask for an identification card verification or whatsoever. Hell half of the people that DM me could have made up their names and I wouldn‚Äôt even know. 
---
Same goes for age. 
---
But those genuine ones. Those are the ones I want to seek out and help out. And so far, I‚Äôve seen a lot of genuine cases. Which is why my list of people I want to see happy on the 27.08.19 has always been expanding since I‚Äôve made this post. 
---
I understand where you are coming from and the call for concern. But so far I‚Äôve not requested any personal information that could bring harm to anyone. 
---
Just like BFA and the random dungeon/raid finder.. you‚Äôve lost the human touch to things. Something I believe people are looking for in Classic where socializing is a key factor. And is what people often look back in reminisce.
---
*sssnnniiiifffff*
---
Are they sending invites? From what I've seen accounts are being manually flagged and the only way to know is if you have the beta option on your client.
---
Dwarf rogue. Shit on other rogues. Stoneform out of bleeds poisons and blinds. You‚Äôll also stand out because most alliance rogues will be basic humans
---
Yes, and are cross realm bgs confirmed? I‚Äôve not been on top of all content released this week, but prior to this there was no confirmed answer if bgs will be per server only or cross realm.
---
i mean most of this sub is just moking and insulting of him so how does it make this sub any better than he is???
---
and i understand that a streamer needs subs...what im saying is that saying the he is just playing classic to get more subs is stupid...even if someone shits on something and then gives it a try in the end doesnt mean they are just doing it to get more subs
---
Server time is PST. Wait a few hours and you should be able to see for yourself (at least via Twitch).
---
Actually it's the only thing I don't like about his content!
---
The classic experience.  Not many took off time to play, just did it after school/work/family time.
---
Just saw someone stream while the sun is setting ingame, so far so good.
---
BFA launch, all of the mythic races, any of the MDIs. 
---
Normally hovers around the 2nd row outside of that, 1st row if asmongold is streaming.
---
Because the emails are delayed. Most people are just checking all their launchers to see if it‚Äôs available
---
MVPs have no insider information, they are powerless forum mods that blizz suckers into working for free
---
It must be pretty nice to have entire summer off though otherwise. You win some, you lose some.
---
Get March break and couple weeks at xmas?
---
Nah hardcore for me
---
Oh shit, no, sorry let me clarify.
---
Druids during Warlords of Draenor got a super cat form beyond regular cat form. [It was a sort of a werecat form](https://external-preview.redd.it/SH2gCDfaOOk6YZlC2x6co_Lx18VWBGVmr9EA-Ygy-NE.png?width=878&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e03fbb22623e05c2c3949f9d97da6f4169ff5986) that allowed the druid to cast spells while transformed. 
---
It was a bit overpowered but everyone loved it. They removed it during Legion, likely in order to show off the new regular cat form appearances that you could unlock.
---
They did release a [COSMETIC werebear form,](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/602347.jpg) ironically enough, and the werecat form was never mentioned again.
---
It sounds like they're inviting Day 1 players this round too.  Pretty cool imo
---
Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad.
---
\-dr zoidberg
---
What?
---
Bought and leveled to in bfa. Unsubbed a few months in.
---
Color Blind noob shits shouldn't get special treatment. 
---
That's the casual baby shit that ruined games. Fucking SJWs.
---
Yea I really wasn't expecting to get in. I don't know what makes my account different other than luck.
---
That jaina?
---
Looks like a boy with tits
---
You seem pleasant, and I bet you get invited to many parties.
---
I'm at work, but the email just says you're in, boot up the launcher, use the dropdown menu to pick "Beta WoW Classic," and install. No code or confirmation as Blizz already stated, just "you've been selected to participate in the beta test of World of Warcraft Classic!"
---
Good guy OP
---
Either way, grats dude. Hella jealous. :)
---
Only parties with real men who don't need special treatment.
---
This catering to people with disabilities, or trying to appeal to women is an attack on masculinity and men. Weakness shouldn't be treated, it needs to be buried.
---
The strong survive and overcome, this is why men, like me want Classic, sucks I have to put up with women and fucking losers.
---
Mage for human, hunter for dwarf.
---
Theres a lot of small dick energy from this post.
---
So wich is better human mage or dwarf hunter?
---
Bet you think it's ok for Women for play Classic.
---
Fucking white Kight beta.
---
Fuck all these cancer streamers
---
Also MR T and his Night Elf Mohawk !!
---
And nowww towlie is back to playing BFA. Fuck that dude
---
I agree! This is what the beta is for!
---
And no one gave a fuck
---
~~THOSE EFFECTS AREN'T VANILLA REEEEEEEEEE~~
---
But really though that does look great. I am one of the few people who was in the boat that keeping the visual improvements was fine by me.
---
This is silly, everyone‚Äôs just going wild in this sub, huh?
---
Chuck Norris doesn't wait for time..
---
Well maybe it's just not raining. Cause. That happens.
---
Don't Hunters counter Rogue?

You're not funny. Nobody's laughing *with* you. Just stop.

https://www.wowhead.com/item=112124/severed-night-elf-head
---
No one yet has told you the truth:  
---
They sold out, then restocked it today.   Just go look on the /r/wow/ sub. Many posts about it being available after it was sold out.  So they are restocking it.  
---
I don't think you need to worry at all.  Just you will have to wait until it is restocked somewhere.
---
so people have a place to post this stuff instead of making a new thread every time a bug/issue is brought up.
---
There's nothing funny here.
---
Just because i'm concerned about the fate of man in this modern world, and you're not, doesn't make what i'm saying you're a joke.
---
Men are systematically being destroyed, and baby shit like color blind mode is a feminist weapon to do it.
---
Or I could just actually play Vanilla on the many accurate vanilla servers out there.
---
thats not the point though...why is it fair to let people in that dont support the game now over people that do support it
---
Is it possible still to move character portrait and target portrait by using the right click menu as you can in bfa?
---
Oh you‚Äôre one of those ‚ÄúI think I want classic but I don‚Äôt‚Äù kinda people.
---
Yep. It‚Äôs the easiest way to distribute to to a bunch of people without burning them out. Instead it increases their hype and allows community and conversation and theorycrafting to grow organically around it.
---
Does... does it hurt?
---
Being that goddamn dumb and frail. Does it hurt?
---
shut up
---
Not sure if serious or designed to trigger.
---
Can confirm its not just streamers, I got in.  Although I've been in like the last 5 betas/alphas so somehow along the way I got my account tagged for these sort of things.  Not that I'm complaining.
---
&gt; colorblind people had to shut the fuck up and deal with it
---
Actually made me laugh out loud
---
But God I hope you're trolling
---
The reason is most likely cause they don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs still around. There are literally millions of accounts created since vanilla wow. How are they supposed to know who is still around? Maybe they send out 10,000 invites but half of those OG accounts they sent it to are people who haven‚Äôt had a blizzard game installed since wrath of the lich king.
---
Then don‚Äôt do it.
---
It could very well be both.
---
Technically you could always get insane grass density with ini edits.
---
Paladin in classic is entirely used for maintaining buffs on the raid. they‚Äôre only 5minutes so be ready to be refreshing buffs a lot
---
I would shamelessly say I would do it for sure.
---
&gt; Just because i'm concerned about the fate of man in this modern world
---
but not colorblind men. Fuck them. But don't really fuck them, cause that's gay
---
\-this guy, probably?
---
No sir.
---
Things like color blind mode are just another part of a much larger system and war on men, to make us weaker and feminize us.  Women treat their problems, MEN overcome and eradicate them.
---
We're not women, we don't need help.
---
True they should just upgrade their eyes smh
---
This dude can‚Äôt be serious. 
---
On the slight chance he is....ROFL
---
Vanilla WoW was never FPS locked. It maxed at whatever refresh rate your monitor had.
---
Yeah, if you can't see green just overcome it and... still not see green.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely serious
---
Yeah, we're called people who actually played the game in Vanilla. Server first every raid through Nax, hours of running and farming and grinding wasn't really fun... more just like a job. Fine for a 20-year-old... less fine for a pushing-40-year-old with a job who wants to go back and re-live fond memories. If they don't fix it... increase drop rates, do something... we'll never get time to get to the fun stuff, we'll be stuck grinding.
---
Let's not get into gays.
---
Those aren't men, those are indoctrinated feminist servants.
---
everyone is just rushing the best drops and mobs grinding spots, this is gonna be zero fucking difference than any private server launch. you cant recreate classic wow it's too well known and guided. gonna be boring af
---
You're allowed to have up to 8 licenses of WoW on one bnet account. If you had more than one they would show up like that. I have the same thing where I have 1 &amp; 2 because when I went to go upgrade from the starter account I accidentally made a new license instead of upgrading.
---
We're getting progressive content, the mounts are a part of that. Seeing people riding around on those mounts is a part of that.
---
&gt; Color Blind noob shits shouldn't get special treatment.
---
"special treatment"
---
AKA "equality" or "getting to see the game reasonalby close to the way others do"
---
60 damage shadowbolt too. That‚Äôs 1/3 of his Hp
---
Cool.
---
Can you imagine having so much free time on your hands that you just log into reddit to farm downvotes?
---
Or it could be a conspiracy.
---
Anyone else feel really good about this dude not being happy about not getting these changes? This rant sure made me feel happy
---
the nicker
---
yes in the most recent dev interview crgbs have been confirmed
---
No, but this does remind me of the old WoW forums. Hooray, we're reliving memories together. (=
---
He's joking when he says stuff like that.
---
Yeah I was really hoping we could escape being treated like kindergartners in classic. This is going to have zero effect on people rushing through leveling.
---
mob is level 3 and taurens get 10 nature resist as a racial. Could just be resisting some of the damage, i believe at that level 10 nature resist makes a pretty big difference
---
you never worked your eye muscles out bro.

If you‚Äôre paying retail you‚Äôre not waiting to pay for something old as it‚Äôs the same sub

Asmongold has a stream personality as a arrogant egotistical player, its his gig and why a lot of people watch him. When he shit talks people he doesn't really mean it, he's just channeling his personality for entertainment. Some people don't like it, but I find it funny.
---
Yes
---
"wotf doesn‚Äôt break fear" excuse me, what did you just type?
---
how so ? they're all leveling hard
---
I got an email. But if you get in you can check above your launch button. It will give you the option‚ÄùWoW Classic Beta‚Äù
---
Check your email but it's an extremely small beta. Most people on the beta are streamers. The others are old Vanilla players.
---
People are allowed to dislike him as well, who gives a shit
---
&gt;No quest giver markers / quest complete markers on mini map... all this will do is make everyone pause play to download a quest helper add-on right away.
---
Get an add-on.
---
&gt;No sparkles on quest items on the ground.
---
Meh.
---
&gt;20 quest limit to the log... lame.
---
Finish your quests.
---
&gt;Re-spec fees, no dual talents. Sucks to be a healer or tank -- and look, we aren't playing this so we have to spend 40 hours / week prepping for a raid, we're playing this for nostalgia and fun. If I have to spend 50g every time I switch to DPS that's going to get old fast.
---
Good gold sink. Get better at farming.
---
&gt;Weapon skills... zzz. They were dumb and still are dumb.
---
Unless you're an Enhancement Shaman, get over it.
---
&gt;No AOE looting... so tedious.
---
They already improved looting. They don't need more.
---
&gt;No raid-wide buffs... oh no. And reagents. Ha, all this will do is force people to download auto-vendor / auto-restock add-ons.
---
K, then they do that.
---
&gt;Only warriors can be pro-tanks, pallies and druids are cut-rate tanks again.
---
That's how Vanilla is.
---
&gt;No hit... get ready to miss a lot.
---
Gear better.
---
&gt;No Warlock Portals / Mage Tables... fuck that's going to be annoying to raid again.
---
Then don't raid.
---
&gt;No group finder... so I guess we run back to Org and spam /2 to find a DPS? Ugh. At least Warlocks will always have party spots! While I do miss the "forced social" aspects of the game back then, I don't think people remember how much time was wasted trying to get dungeon groups back in the day...
---
Get the *fuck out*.
---
&gt;No mounts until 40... I'll catch flak for this I suspect, but look all the running was tedious and painful. Watching the streamers today, man... gimme a damn mount out of the gate.
---
*GET THE FUCK OUT.*
---
&gt;No heirloom gear... OK, I mean... we can still just power level alts by buying two accounts and running them through dungeons... it's horribly anti-social... would be better to give everyone heirloom options when they hit max level. Meh, you can only have 3 toons anyway, ain't nobody going to have that many alts... but I do want a huntard, a warrior, and a priest... guess I can't have a warlock or mage or anything else I used to play. Fucking bullshit to have to stick to one class... but meh. Fine. I don't have time like I used to anyway. Just... why not 10 character slots, why change this one thing?!
---
#*GET THE FUCK OUT.*
---
&gt;No WoW tokens... um, dude... I ain't gonna farm for hours on end, I just want to buy some gold, and play the game for fun now. I'm pushing 40 and I don't have time to play this 40 hours / week to get to the stuff I miss about Vanilla. Shit was fun in my 20s, but it's gonna be a ghost town quick if I can't just buy some shit with real life money instead of trading my time for it. Part of the game... sure, but I honestly can't see farming. Does that mean Vanilla isn't for me? Meh, I mean... I'm stoked about Vanilla, but I sure as shit an't stoked about farming. It has to be a fun experience, right? I want to get back into raiding with old friends, not grind up rep for 2,000 hours like I had to do in the olden days to get that trinket with +3 mp/5 over what I had when I started the grind...

Literally nobody here is laughing **with** you.

Hi, /u/Benjaminovitz
---
That is not an exploit. That is client limitation and it should be preserved because it affects gameplay.
---
What happened to internet trolling? Why the hell do people just shout a bunch of insensitive garbage and think they are clever? You had one job. Replicate trolling, and in my classic, people knew how to actually do it without being cringeworthy.
---
Absolutely ridiculous. Figures tryhards are at it again.

So....Retail? Lol taking the rpg elements out of the game?

I'd suggest playing wc3 and reading the vanilla-era books instead to avoid the retcons.

Andddd towlliee is back to playing BFA day 1 of classic beta
---
We small time streamers are the saddest of the clowns streaming for 10 guys or less on average.. But I dunno, I still like doing it after doing it for like 7 years..

Even having 1 person being active in your chat talking to you and reacting with you is much better than playing games alone for 25+ years and have nobody to share the good moments with.

This was already covered in the thread posted here already. The DB says they're supposed to hit 3-5 damage (or whatever the exact number is) and they do.

These changes are exactly why people want vanilla servers?

You answered your own question. ‚ÄúBig streamer‚Äù
---
If you're horde, south Darkshore will piss a lot of people off.
---
Which were confirmed to not be on launch iirc, but later possibly I guess
---
Just curious, did you get an email? I‚Äôd like to keep checking throughout the week without having to check my client.
---
so you havent subbed since wrath and they gave you an invite, what a fucking retarded ingrate fucking company no reward for the loyalists keeping this zombie terd of a fucking game alive for classic to be relaunched
---
I did just get an email several hours after the fact.  Normal looking Blizz beta invite email.
---
damn son gz
---
Look at aol, msn messenger etc, all things come to an end someday. Hell myspace was believed to last forever too!
---
screenshot your launcher please , i think i got one but not sure how can i see it
---
&gt; the mounts are a part of that
---
No they aren't.  They've said they won't be a part of that.  Read the quote, they say they don't want to **add them** for a little bit of time.  They were not in 1.12, they aren't going to be in Classic either.
---
Ah, now I don‚Äôt have to check my client every 10 minutes. Thank you
---
Is this that "I like to jump like a horse" kid, but grown up?
---
I won‚Äôt. Having an option to not pay is not the issue. It‚Äôs the incentives they‚Äôre providing for folks willing to pay early.
---
loooolololol love it
---
Streamers are cancer.
---
I can‚Äôt see how long the match lasted, I can‚Äôt zoom in I‚Äôm on mobile. Someone tell me!
---
I have seen people ride little motorcycles in round cages backwards around fire.
---
I dont see why this is so impressive
---
&gt; How are they supposed to know who is still around?
---
You mean out of the people who checked the "Im interested in Classic WoW beta"-box that they added a few days ago? Probably by having people check a box they just added a few days ago :D
---
So, women can't play wow?
---
Please provide evidence of Towelliee shit talking classic.
---
You need to have wallpaper engine on your PC
---
Every change you listed is what made the game shit. 
---
Your server first rhetoric carries no weight here, go toot your classic sucks horn over on
---
r/wow I‚Äôm sure there will be a line up of ‚ÄúQOL makes the game better‚Äù types there willing to fellate you there.
---
AWw come on
---
Same, I'm really bummed. It's not just about missing the chance to get one, not seeing a single person riding around with one won't feel right.
---
Inbox me come august...  I'll give a few 3 month subs.
---
The dream of getting an ivory raptor in Classic, since there wont be unarmored mounts.
---
Its just picking a name.  Not exactly game changing. Perhaps this is them referring to not recreating the launch experience, slamming the creation server with thousands of people at once.
---
no that kills most jokes
---
In Desolace no-one hears you scream.
---
toweliee and his followers are fucking cucks. gtfo

Beta.  Go bug report it if you are in Beta and they are missing.
---
Noice
---
Paladins can have **literally** 0 downtime when using level 1 Seal of Command, especially when adding in spell damage gear and consumes at level 40.
---
Paladin is A level.
---
&gt;Paladins get no movement speed until later on in the game
---
? Like level 22? 8% run+ mounted travel speed all the time.
---
&gt;Leveling is just autoattacking
---
Boring =/= slow
---
Paladins can do sub 120 hour quite easily.
---
You do realize that he is probably only going to play retail to raid which is 9 hours a week, the other ~60 hours a week he streams will probably be classic.
---
Wouldn't be a bug if they are disabled
---
I could take time off, there is nothing holding me back... But I wonder if it would just be better to work like normal and let people get ahead. Maybe make a long weekend or leave at noon on the Friday... There will be lots of time left in my life to play classic.
---

please provide an example of said shit talking.

I watched a streamer earlier with 10,000+ viewers and he was an embarrassment tbh. I don‚Äôt mind someone being a noob but a noob being all look how great I am is cringe city.
---
This is obviously a shitpost/troll, but if not, you might be more interested in Modern WoW

We knew streamers were getting invites. You should've lead with that.

#$$$$$$ ACTIVISION BLIZZARD REQUIRES MORE $$$$$$

And you know that for a fact how?

so he‚Äôs not only talking to a minor but soliciting personal information. Be very careful mate. If he‚Äôs genuine then that‚Äôs good but still be hesitant.
---
Imagine if your parents knew what u were doing
---
does anyone know the size of the client? like how many gbs?
---
Yes it is, school days though make me wish I just have a 9-5 job. I get rough students. Fighting, cussing, throwing chairs and that is only a first grade class.
---
They have exactly 3 viewers right now. They stream for their friends. I didnt intend for it to sound like they were big streamers.
---
It might be a bug. We dont know. Doesnt hurt to report it.
---
Summer just means it gets so hot in my house when I use a computer I have to drag my portable ac from my office to my game room and visa versa.

Ah yes, I just caved an bought it right before you sent that.  Figured that's what it was

Playing a TBC server. It's very similar, obviously, but I'd like to think I am not spoiling Vanilla/Classic for myself.
---
Uhh think you might be responding to the wrong person here lol. Please explain how I am "all over this thread" when that was literally my only comment?
---
BUT HE WAS SO HYPED :))))
---
"As soon as possible" is the issue. They're flying blind, could be a week before it's down to normal server size, could be months, might not happen at all. The tourism spike will likely only last a few days, that's why sharding for a few days and a few zones made perfect sense. Let the noobs get a taste for classic, then when they make it to their third zone or second week let them get a taste for a real server launch, chips fall where they may.
---
They'd find people would support them if they still made good games.
---
Holy shit she got an invite? I remember all the anti vanilla videos she made, said she didn't get it, and nobody should/would play it LMAOOOO. That Blizzard money really makes people say nice things.
---
8/10
---
This has to sting eh? Bitch
---
Raid respec on Tuesday 50g.
---
Clear mc/bwl Tuesday.

Next day is Wednesday so raids reset. Clear mc/bwl.
---
Respec 50g.
---
Pvp/farm for wed,Thursday,Friday,sat,sun,Monday, Tuesday. (Raid reset but u dont respec to clear yet) wednesday,Thursday,Friday, sat, sun, Monday.
---
Respec Tuesday 50g to clear weekly reset and repeat.
---
This gives 2 weeks almost of free time. Raid log if you like. Or pvp farm for 2 weeks.
---
Go play retail
---
The chart is nice, but the fact remains that if people are able to change layers at will via creative grouping, then layering will be used for exploiting. I want to hear this addressed from Blizzard.
---
DMG/COMBAT TEXT fonts.

Not a bug, but still worth mentioning.

In 1.12, numbers are bigger, juicy'n'sticky.

I noticed it too, hard to tell without playing.... ill gladly test it for you Blizzard if youll let me :)
---
i aint never seen someone take the bait so hard
---
100% trolling
---
I don‚Äôt know why blizzard gave them beta 100+ days before release. They‚Äôll get bored with no one else in the world other than themselves.
---
Swapping weapons slots cancelled spells before 2.4.3.  I cannot say for sure for vanilla, but in the first pvp season of TBC, so 2.0 or 2.1 at the latest I explicitly tested this with Paladin and weapon swapping cancelled and/or globaled me.  
---
I tried to macro a shield and caster 1h with my heals, and a 2h with my attacks.  Same results when trying to swap librams.  I should mention that they seemed to work out of combat, and only globaled you while in combat.
---
shadow priest
---
Lol wtf. 
---
If I did that my mom would have hurt me. Badly. Afraid if that lady when I was a kid
---
Billy went to live on a farm and he's very happy there.
---
Has anyone without active subscription received an invite?
---
The run speed looks different playing on a 16:9 monitor vs the 4:3 monitors of the old days. This is probably what's changed.
---
No, it's purely world pvp for the first phase
---
Leveling a Holy Priest. I've had my fill of tanking and dps'ing, got in to healing on retail recently and am really enjoying myself. I also love their tier sets and would love an opportunity to get Anathema/Benediction.
---
I wanna be the guy who says after every dungeon 'add me to friends if you ever need heals'. I plan to go out of my way to help people by healing their dungeons or elite quests, even if there's nothing really in for me. I just wanna enjoy playing and being helpful, hopefully make a good name for myself.
---
I know leveling won't be fantastic but I'm willing to stick with it for the endgame satisfaction.
---
I opted in yesterday. I am from US and have been subbed on and off thru each expansion since day one vanilla. I got invited to beta today. I am nobody :****( plasw 2 be my friend d I like to pvp kek
---
This needs more upvotes
---
I don‚Äôt think the head drops/quests are in 1.12 AV
---
The 1.12 screenshot you have uses a custom font, they weren't like that without addons.
---
Thanks for feedback without being toxic, I did mention that paladin / shaman are the two classes I haven't played much.
---
Thanks for the information, I never really looked at paladins in such a way, since i've only hit 20ish on one.
---
Warriors vid were this, Maydie, and Hulksmash.
---
But the biggest video was for sure the fucking Serenity Now video. That turned me into the griefer I am today.
---
You truly think that the live game will take a back seat to classic? At launch no doubt but I imagine the drop off in the classic player base over the first few weeks and months will be drastic until the player base of classic settles into a small but dedicated group.
---
This is correct.
---
Nice
---
yeah i noticed this too from watching  asmongold and shrouds stream.  you can see the little moon and stars in the upper right corner on the  mini map but the game still looks like mid day brightness. no night sky,  no darkness. can anyone confirm if they are removing night time from  classic like they did retail?
---
Just play retail wow up until level 60. Literally has everything you want.
---
Was watching a couple retail streamers bitching about dying like 5+ times. ‚ÄúFuck this game is hard.‚Äù
---
Yeah, just how I fucking like it!
---
FOV makes it look that way
---
In the fly through video preview of the zones that Wowhead posted the other day you can see it raining in a few parts of the video.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=454&amp;v=qg83lvEVdmw
---
This is sketchy as fuck
---
I don't think Classic sucks, but I think it's short-sighted to think that there haven't been some improvements to the game over the years, and I also think it's short-sighted to think gamers have the same expectations as they did in 2004. They need this to be successful to justify the expense of doing it, and -- like the movie -- they'll get one shot at it. If it fails, that's the end of nostalgia.
---
Vanilla isn't going to be the draw for most users, that'd likely be ICC-era, the last patch of Wrath would be what I'd have went with. It's not modern WoW, but it's not quite as painful and unrefined either. Most of Vanilla wasn't done the way it was because people thought it was the best, it was just done that way out of necessity or because they didn't know any better.
---
I'm sure a lot of people will dabble, but without raiding... the game won't keep interest. And without some QoL improvements, the masses aren't going to get to max-level, and so you won't have the same pool to raid with. Maybe there are enough die-hard purists, but given how subs keep dropping... I honestly don't think it's the right move for this day and age.
---
Anyway come August, we'll see... but I'm going to be really sad if we don't get an ICC-era server. I don't know that Vanilla will hold people's interest and have the same attention / satisfaction return on investment needed to sustain itself or future development. Hope I'm wrong, but... I haven't heard of anyone who was like, "Man, I miss the days when hunters could accidentally take off tank's sunder stacks by putting up Mark at the wrong time."
---
There have been improvements to the game since Vanilla... I can't imagine anyone has the time we had in our 20s... like... I want this to be successful, and I really have worries it won't be. That's all.
---
Beautiful
---
then play horde
---
See, I don't see how it permanently fucks the server population or has any effect on it that isn't the exact same as sharding or better. You still have not explained this. Also, it is you who was talking about changing the vanilla experience as if it was a bad thing, then promoting sharding.
---
I love that clip. Skadoodle made me tear up abit when he said it
---
Oh it‚Äôs that easy now. I remember setting up rainmeter or some shit and having to convert files and such to get them to work.
---
I'm pretty sure it was inky one day. But that day was amazing, running Death Wish with Mortal Strike was an eye opening day for me. I was wielding Spinal Reaper at the time, so I didn't hit quite as hard as Pat, but man was it fun.
---
It's worth it

But i have to like looking at my toon.

I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing.
---
Learning every class by playing them, I remember that was a blast.
---
you're either pro or noob.  that's life
---
I also use my dogs tactics of avoiding the sun and run from tree to tree and hide under bushes
---
Don't really care if he's a troll or not. It's not like I had to put in a lot of effort to tell him to fuck off.
---
That's because they designed Outland around flying. If they didn't have flying, that could still have designed the world around exploring on foot... Duh.. your argument makes no god damn sense... Of course if they decide to add flying, they will try and make it decent...
---
Nah
---
That is not at all what the font looked like in 1.12 lmao
---
What's the cost here? Like a sub fee? Probably I'd do it for a sub fee
---
Didn‚Äôt they say in an interview they were changing all font to match BFA? I know they talked about name tags, but not sure if they mentioned combat dmg and text.
---
There's one that sends you to Stormwind. From there the connection to Westfall is simple.
---
Na the 15min greater blessings will be out.
---
But that was terrible before they added greater blessings lol
---
As someone who is playing on a private classic server, and BFA. I enjoy both. It's possible to be happy and enjoy both games. 
---
It's just elitism plain and simple.
---
Its supposed to be 12 hours of day 12 hours of night based on the servers timezone. At least thats how I remember it, it could be vastly different now.
---
Or maybe you are just retarded if you are ‚Äútricked‚Äù by any of these things.
---
Don't forget how they gave Shaman to the Alliance and Paladin to the Horde.. that's the other shitty move that killed faction identity.
---
The irony is a small number of people being upset at someone not getting into beta, salty as fuck about those who did get into beta and I‚Äôm sitting here with no idea who any of them are.
---
I think I‚Äôm winning.
---
This literally is mind boggling to me.... 
---
What in the good Lord
---
The fact that it works on wide-screen means it isn't true to Vanilla.
---
Why not add in dual spec too?
---
3-toons max? Not like they aren't changing things, let's get some more qualify of life improvements -- like support for wide screen -- that didn't exist back in the day.
---
It is 100% marketing.  Shroud, a big CSGO player and major streamer, has a beta pass.
---
Pretty sure it's based on the real cycle of the zone the server is based in.
---
Just to be sure: you don't need an active sub to receive a beta invite, correct?
---
Layering has nothing to do with this ?
---
people have tested it and its the same
---
That's a good wand shoot button. :D
---
there were rain effects in staysafes alpha gameplay video
---
My email is pretty much right in the middle of the alphabet.
---
Lolol
---
Ty!
---
I'm being a little snippy :P
---
Judge is fairly garbage damage, so ignore it aside from an initial short pull, maybe. It's just mana lost (judge / reseal) that can be saved in less downtime.
---
And rank 1 seal of command = 70% weapon damage. Max rank = 70% weapon damage. So keep with the 65 mana R1 and just keep killing while others have to stop to drink.
---
that's pushed backwards which is the complete opposite of what he was asking
---
its still the same story, just with more money
---
I know, man, before Discord existed, people were sending letters by pigeons..
---
It's just for phase 1 at most. Ion said he wants to turn it off sooner than the end of phase 1 ending, but it will be based on how crowded areas are.
---
I do believe the potential is there. You have to remember that when Classic WoW ended, its popularity was still INCREASING. It was gaining millions of subscriptions. We did not see what the true peak of Classic was because TBC came out.
---
I also believe that the number of people who "play" BFA is over inflated. Many subscriptions are not active, but are still being paid because quite frankly, many people forget to cancel. We see this with all subscription based services, like American Online. An indication of this is the r/WoW subreddit subscriber numbers. They have barely twice the number of active users but have 10x the number of subscribers as this subreddit. Most of those subscribers just didn't bother to unsubscribe. I know that when money is involve, some people are more likely to unsubscribe, but $15 is not very much and many people just keep it going so they can log in once in a while rather than play the game meaningfully.
---
So I really do think Classic WoW has the potential to overshadow retail WoW for the next two years. I think it's actually very likely actually.
---
Slap ass!!! Heahehaheha
---
Thanks
---
It was based on the timezone of your server, in the same 24 hour cycle. If you could only play at night, you only saw nighttime in azeroth.
---
Hunter, because I want all the loot :) seriously though, try out a few of them to see what you like, nothing else will work.
---
I played a rogue for most of WoW starting from vanilla, my first and only 60, I'm debating to play one again or a healer, I've been playing a healer for the past two expansions and have been pretty good at it. 
---
I've really enjoyed both but dont know what to do. I've been a pally healer but I really don't want to spam buffs every 5 minutes. I dunno
---
It might?  
---
The "activate windows" thing is overlayed on the desktop, so it really depends on how they do that, it might be that WE paints it's layer on top of that. Hard to say. I could test with Safemode, as that draws version info on the desktop with (I believe) the same method, but that sounds like a lot of work.  
---
You should just grab a serial, there are tons of subs where people sell copies of 7/8.1/10 for damn near 7 8 and 10 dollars (wordplay, I think a copy of 10 is 20-30 or so, typically). People tend to sell their serials from bulk buys in their IT department, so while not necessarily super moral since that's not their intended use, they are legitimate, and legal.
---
Honestly, the only thing frontstabbing really affects is leveling spec. It makes a less-viable spec slightly less less-viable.
---
If you want to go through that hassle to level as dagger /sub, do it.
---
Pro tip. Just pick what you want to play. it‚Äôs literally not a big deal
---
Didn't he have a raid to go to though? I remember him saying he had a raid a little after classic beta launch, before I left his channel today.
---
I ain't playing that shit. "Layering until everyone following a guide hits 60." It's not Classic, and further, it's not even in their interest as a company. The whole point of the design is to slow down player progress, that way they could collect 45-60 bucks per player before 60, instead of 15. Other players is a good thing, if retail taught us anything it's surely that.
---
Why do you care about hunter PvE scaling when you seem to be making your decision based off PvP?  Hunters always have good burst dmg and do just fine if not better in PvP than the majority.
---
It'll tell in subscriptions too
---
Basically yeah, there's usually a mechanism with a spring and/or some metal bits involved that make mechanical keyboards feel different from most keyboards which use a rubber mat. They generally feel better to use than standard keyboards and there're near-infinite different solutions, versions and iterations of switches for anyone's preference 
---
There's a lot of little details &amp; features that set them apart, even between different kinds of mechanical switches, but that's the gist. There are wikis and hobbyist communities if you want more in-depth info
---
Who fucking knows.
---
Dwarf Rogue is OP in PVP.
---
I think it's a good plan to give streamers/content creators invites first. To build up the hype. No matter what game
---
And yet it's still true that cross-realm collusion will be much easier and more importantly, more prevalent in classic
---
Bring on more strawmen it'll further your point I'm sure
---
More than likely TBC if Classic is very successful. If it's not super successful they may just add a raid or dungeon or two as extra lvl 60 content down the line
---
If you want efficient testing how about giving it to somebody who will play it and have that footage watched by thousands more who will also get to analyse the content and spot errors.... why do you think streamers are in? Publicity and audience.
---
Really? I wasnt aware of that. So hunters are top of the good chain in pvp?
---
Thanks for the answer
---
How so? What about orc stun resistance
---
I like how ion said the exact opposite in his interview. Glad to know they‚Äôre all on the same page.
---
might be one of the reasons it's so small.
---
Someone mentioned this on Tips stream and apparently shroud had multiple 60s on nost, so is into classic
---
Word isn't that huge of a deal for an ally lock, just deathcoil it and by the time they're out and have taken a few steps the immunity is gone. Also horde warlocks have to deal with paladin's cleansing everything they have
---
They said nothing planned yet. It could happen. But we don't know.
---
Lmaooooo shut up
---
I started playing on a pserver and by level 15 I had been dead more times than the entirety of legion (excluding raiding I guess).
---
Joana and Kargoz ? Never even heard of these people, so clearly not that relevant.
---
Do you think that if classic becomes really popular, they will add brand new content?
---
What is "word"? Are human warlocks top of the food chain for pvp still?
---
did they fix tauren hitbox? it should be slightly larger than other hitboxes, i am not sure by how much exactly but there was someone who had values for it after the classic demo at blizzcon
---
Nothing planned yet but it's a possibility, it all depends on the players  is what I heard from an interview.
---
Bleed / poison (including Blind) removal with stoneform.
---
Rogue vs Rogue they are very strong.
---
Tipsput asked about BC or Wrath servers and this was their answer. 
---
Next time quote the whole answer or show what question they answered. 
---
Have a downvote.
---
A hunter has a very low win chance against a rogue if both have equal access to gear, cd's, and consumables. Think about how a hunter can keep a rogue off him if the rogue has FAP and sprint. Not to mention all the ways to counter a hunter's CC's even without FAP. Skull of impending doom, blind then trigger trap, nets, trinket stuns, etc.
---
First one is never free, it's 10s or 1g,can't remember
---
Are you going to pick horde?
---
Gnome warrior is better than human for pvp
---
He had a raid to attend. Guild commitments.
---
can you get me an RTX 2070 instead? just scrapped my savings to build my wife a pc so she can experience it first. thanks in advanced!
---
This is correct.  
---
Utilizing spells and kiting..... even as enhance is how you should play.
---
If you learn the nuances a shaman can beat pretty much any class besides a mage that 2 hits you out of poly
---
I want to be ally.
---
Alright, screw the font, but the numbers itself *used to stay in the screen longer* and be bigger, i swear. Let's take completely different example then!
---
[This](https://puu.sh/DsVmU/05cef9fb1a.png) is what appears to be OG vanilla movie [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX7RuUcd-3Q), and [This](https://puu.sh/DsVy6/d7ede9e8c2.png) is how crits are looking in the demo (Staysafe stream, [VOD Link](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425193643?t=08h26m22s) )
---
Numbers are definetely smaller than they used to be, and disappearing the second they pop.
---
Fine if you‚Äôve never heard of Kargoz, but you‚Äôre a vanilla noob if you‚Äôve never heard of Joana
---
Yeah the kids are screwed anyway. OP better call in "sick" and get some real gainz!
---
It's not for everyone, but that's the whole point of the game for me. Vanilla is about the journey, and if my play session gets interrupted by some back and forth PvP, then that's part of the fun!
---
Sure, it's annoying when some salty scrub takes his BG loss out on level 20s in Ashenvale, but it's all part of the experience. Maybe you just go level some professions or go to another zone until they get bored.
---
I want to be ally but being horde isnt off the menu i guess..
---
It's not impossible, but I just don't see it. We have to remember that classic wow was in the early to mid 2000's - the online gaming space wasn't as big as it is today, the streaming space was non-existant. We werent overwhelmed by great, easily accessible games like we are now and the main hype drivers - streamers - weren't even around back then.
---
In a day where Fortnite, League of Legends and Counterstrike is still king, does classic wow have a place? With a few small dedicated fanbase absolutely. But with anything even resembling it's former glory? I don't think so.
---
I also don't see most high profile streamers make classic wow their main driver. I doubt Shroud, Ninja or some of the others will bring in new players to the game. And of the wow streamers, how many will be solely focused on classic, knowing it's a game that requires a lot of time and effort? 
---
I may be wrong. We'll have to see.
---
How did they fuck this up? It‚Äôs correct on pservers
---
New quest/raid content. Not new races, classes, talents, lfg tools etc.
---
What class do you want to play?
---
My top picks are human mage/lock. Or dwarf hunter. So the strongest pvp 1v1 pvp class out of those.
---
Wotf. I don't know about specific races of locks but SL locks regardless are pretty much at the top of vanilla PVP
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291725/burning-crusade-and-wrath-legacy-servers-possibly-in-wows-future
---
would depend on how popular classic is longterm I imagine
---
I think I had the same issue with that one, I think it's broken. But I think there's another one on there that does work.
---
Human mage it is then, have fun mate.
---
Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
When is the next wave of invites?
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
I honestly would give a shit if they added the modern quest tracking system, with the arrows and the blue circles on the map. 
---
Everyone is just going to download an add on that does it anyway so I‚Äôd rather have something baked into the game that isn‚Äôt clunky as hell.
---
I wonder which streamer you're talking about. Could it any of the many method streamers who do raid streams? The high level m+ pushers who do dungeon content? How about the PvP streamers doing arenas? oh wait, hes talking about asmongold and then acting as though the streamer he watches (understandably, because his content is often classic /old school mmo oriented) is representative of the whole community... 
---
How are you going to have this argument when you clearly dont watch BFA streams, you watch Asmon who plays BFA on his stream sometimes
---
Needs 4:3 and 20 fps as well
---
I remember seeing raids come through  thinking I wasn't flagged. That moment of panic when you realize you're flagged... oh shit time to leave! Haha
---
Clown.
---
Lol I hope you get banned. If I saw you doing that id report your ass over and over
---
They said this is one way to gauge the interest to prepare with a healthy amount of servers.
---
They don't want too many because most people will just try out classic during the first week and then quit. Also they don't want too few servers with risk of queues.
---
I think it's fair.
---
Thank you!
---
If he isn‚Äôt he should be lol
---
Nice bait
---
Do you think as a human mage i csn handle most 1v1 fights? Or would a sl lock be better for that
---
I know I'm not in beta.. But both my friend I who are day one vanilla players were watching a couple streams and health regen seems way too fast. We both remember having to eat frequently between mobs even in BC for fresh characters.
---
I didn't see anything Tipsout has even put out about Classic in a long time, you  prick.
---
Chuck Norris keeps a night light on. Not because he's afraid of the dark, but because the dark is afraid of him.
---
Rip I‚Äôm a dumbass lol
---
Just lol
---
Sounds like something that should be happening in the background mistakenly being listed in the chat. I vaguely remember playing a private server years ago with a similar issue. I'd report it as a bug
---
Am i the only one who finds this new widespread streamer hate meta kinda pathetic? Fucking let people do what they want to do.
---
Tips didn't even interview Patrick Dawson, the dev that OP quoted.
---
He sounds like the successful brother of the "nUmBeR FiFtEeN BuRgEr kInG FoOt lEtTuCe" guy.
---
This is the butthurt redditors starter pack.
---
In early vanilla yes, because flares were completely invisible and pets could attack you right out of vanish and sometimes bug out so hard they'd see right through stealth from really far away (like max range distance).
---
It was also easy to kite dagger rogues when people had shitty connections but if you were swords it went along better
---
Classic wow had big news just today and still has hype behind the wait to play it.
---
wow is in steady mode.
---
Right. No idea what that dude is dribbling about...
---
Asmond has 35k viewers and is literally the number 1 wow streamer every time he has streamed the game for the last year. The game literally jumps positions on twitch when he's online. He has been hyping classic wow since it's announcement.
---
Ok dude.
---
Osconty died for my sins.
---
They didn't fuck it up, this is how dark it was in Vanilla. This is one of those things that people think they remember but it's just a bullshit memory created my low view distance and crappy monitors.
---
Did somebody say [thunderfury blessed blade of the windseeker] ?
---
No rain in Lakeshire is definitely not vanilla
---
Oh yeah wotf that skeleton racial that breaks polymorph.
---
**ITS A COMPANY WHAT DO YOU FUCKING EXPECT**
---
Lol they will be better. Just wait and see
---
I still find it laughable that this guy got a beta invite. I‚Äôve no idea why blizzard are prioritizing all these streamers into the beta.
---
Also getting downvoted by some seething rogue who got clapped up by locks in vanilla
---
:O
---
Or months, or years for some people. It's a very personal and subjective thing, which is weird to say about a video game. Yet, people love this game for very different reasons. Someone who really focuses on tradeskills for instance may take 6-8 months to level. If they find collecting patterns at each level enjoyable and creating outfits and selling items fun, no system is in place to force them into leveling beyond simply wanting access to more cradtable items. Take into account that each character can have three secondary and two primary professions, and one could get lost in those aspects of the game very easily. 
---
The same can be said for the lore delivered in questing, or simply exploration,  and it's easy to see how you could get distracted. That's one reason why this game is so beloved and amazing.
---
That is literally the definition of an exploit.
---
There is kinda a lot to unpack with that question man.
---
Just play what you man. Min-maxing is destructive. When you are trying to min-max your char - you are playing the fucking calculator , not the wow. Play any race, troll, undy, tau. Warr is good on any race. Use hamstring kite and /sit macro. Enjoy.
---
The "point" of classic is to enjoy it in whichever way you find best, if someone finds more enjoyment in minmaxing then that is what they should do, likewise if you want to play tauren and that's what makes you happy then you should do that.
---
He is using third party programs to manipulate WoW and you don't calm that an exploit? What world do you live in?
---
It's also something easy to trace if they look for it. So he and all others will get banned in the future anyway.
---
It's better than current WoW by far and simple enough to get into for any new player
---
In between a purge/ shock/ pummel intercept combo... along with windfury and nature's swiftness.... not beat a priest/ warrior. 
---
The priest literally can't do anything.  As a shaman you can actually get away from a warrior
---
Are you a gladiator now on live or were back then? Because I don't even recognize what they have done in live....
---
I was gladiator twice once in BC and Wrath.
---
I think I was rank 11 in vanilla,  but I was honestly too young and impatient then to grind bgs for a higher rank.
---
Now you're right about elemental utility being the optimal spec... but that's a different argument
---
WoW being streamed would mean streamers playing WoW. Is that something we really want?
---
Oh hey, I'm the creator of these wallpapers! I'm glad you like them! I you have any requests for other areas in vanilla WoW to make wallpapers out of, feel free to let me know.
---
So... full disclosure, I'm going to play this with my girlfriend. I didn't do that back in Vanilla, but now... only way I'm going to get time for it is to play with her.
---
And every time I have to tell her, "Stop, log out, we need to install an addon..." instead of just playing... is going to make it that much harder for me to actually get to pay. I want this to be friendly and easy for someone who didn't play back then, or else it's not useful for me.
---
She's played WoW, briefly, but if the game doesn't work the way she's used to... she's going to get annoyed with it. Meh, I get this is a channel for purists, but I don't think enough people are going to play this and keep legacy development going up to ICC-era gameplay. And that makes me really sad.
---
I was someone who played the shit out of this game back in Vanilla, I did all the time-sink stuff needed to be good back then. It wasn't fun, or a badge of honor, or anything other than a time sink due to limited tech / limited UX research.
---
They're already making changes... wide-screen support, limited to 3 toons per account, etc. I'm just advocating for a few more quality of life things that will allow people who are used to modern WoW to be sucked in so enough people will play this for a long enough time to justify Blizzard spending more money on legacy development going forward.
---
Hope I'm wrong, but I see this flopping and dying out pretty quick. Then, when Blizzard has more data to tell us, "We're going mobile-only, sorry." There's a lot riding on this. Gotta make sure it's a success. I really hope all the die-hard purists come out of the woodwork, but look... ain't nobody alive who is under 35 who remembers actually playing for serious in Vanilla... and the time constraints on a 35 year-old are not going to allow us to play like we used to. Right?
---
Some adaptations have to be made so we can get to the fun stuff that we want to relive, and not just get stuck running and grinding and spamming /2 for a tank for dungeon runs.
---
I never watch streams, but after seeing this I decided to drop in on one for a minute. Watched Asmongold and his friend pull too many and Asmongold dies on his warrior. Then he asks his pally friend, "Did you do the res quest?"
---
"Nope."
---
Haha I was just watching that too.
---
Some pro LOS strats in Moonbrook though.
---
Can you actually confirm it is gone, or was it just not raining during the test you watched someone in a zone that it rains in? Can't rain all the time...
---
Chuck Norris memes are dead stop they‚Äôre from like 2005
---
It‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre using it as a promotional tool and not as a shakedown. 
---
Or am I being too cynical?
---
PvP is a bit different. Drink when u can, and you‚Äôre ok.
---
Not touching profs until 60.  Exception being first aid
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that it‚Äôs not allowed to directly mention pservers but vanilla has two big ones right now. One‚Äôs huge and overpopulated and the other one has a vanilla like population. Just google for servers and you‚Äôll immedeately find them.
---
Retro-wow is nothing compared to those two.
---
This is nice but NEETs shouldn‚Äôt really be enabled
---
Never said that I knew it.
---
INFP Alliance Hunter DPS PVE/PVP
---
And added a Disturbed or Linkin Park song.
---
Yeah, let r/classicwow decide who gets beta.
---
In the last days I began to hate this community.
---
I'm a huge fan of orcs and tauren they're my favorite races in the game period, but I have more history and feel more connected to the world as a tauren. Something about logging into mulgore after deleting lvl 5 alliance, back in 05. It was amazing. I love orcs but the zone of the tauren making it feel like you leave that beautiful pocket of mulgore into the intense barrens. Plus anyone remember pats videos? Tauren can be some mean warriors too.
---
I was torn between the two at first but I decided my wife wants tauren shaman and I'll roll tauren warrior again. It'll be the best experience. Then when she's not able to play with me I'll level my alt orc hunter.
---
Disincentivised?
---
No defo not. What I loved about wow was the sense of working for your character progression. Not getting everything easy. Also I didn‚Äôt like all that wrk being wiped as soon as a new expansion was released and the level cap increased again.
---
Very excited for classic though, will be fun.
---
Very excited to see the result. Been waiting two days now.
---
This is what guilds are for.
---
You can‚Äôt go wrong with mage.   But as everyone else said.  Try out a few and see what you like
---
Got in with an email.
---
* Opted in May 14.
---
* Not a content creator in any way.
---
* Activated my sub for the beta.  Stopped playing in Cataclysm.
---
* NA - Canada.
---
* Account created with the original beta in 2004.
---
* Played vanilla through the beginning of Cataclysm (~200 days played).
---
* Participated in most/all betas from the start to Cataclysm.  Provided maybe 5-10 bug reports each time.
---
Well I‚Äôm probably going to be going warrior so first aid is a must, definitely will be leveling first aid. As for other professions I‚Äôll probably save them for 60, I haven‚Äôt decided though.
---
Leveling with herbalism and skinning, taking alchemy when I get to 60, figure I‚Äôll take my time leveling, so might as well gather as much as I can
---
Hahaha yeah oops.
---
Here's Shroud's stream if you would have waited a little longer. The game doesn't just go DAY-NIGHT immediately, it's a slow transition: [https://i.imgur.com/l3S2R0N.png](https://i.imgur.com/l3S2R0N.png)
---
They could've just kept it in Outland once they'd realised their mistake.
---
Good luck doing that on PvE server (where many of them will probably play because of this exact reason).
---
beta invites need a sub, lol
---
classic is inevitable
---
Don‚Äôt people realize that the popular streamers get catered to? Free advertising, free hype. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre the best for the beta or not. They get the most views.
---
Was tauren warrior back in vanilla, and really liked this orc hunter who kind of helped my young ass learn more about my class. Can't wait
---
THE BUG! IT KILLS US!!
---
Mulgore does have a very tranquil atmosphere to it, personally I love trolls and gnomes, hate durotar though but I think I'm going troll main anyway because I've done gnome so many times, I'll probably end up levelling another as gnome simply because I love it so much though.
---
So if the server has up to three layers it still shares the same AH?
---
I don‚Äôt think your being too cynical. 
---
Like asmongold got as beta invite, the guy who bashes blizzard and wow daily on his streams and admits that he‚Äôs never played a vanilla privet server. So how would he know if something is working as intended or not? 
---
I watched hi stream for about 3hrs today while he was duo leveling with Esfand, not once did I see him report any of the bugs he came across. Or even look for bugs as he was playing.
---
Also once the interest dries up these streamers will all move on to other things and just leave the wow beta.
---
So the TLDR is that blizzard gave streamers a bunch of special treatment to get them into the beta so they can use it as advertisement. And these guys aren‚Äôt participating in the soul purpose of a beta which is to look for bugs.
---
I don't think Classic WoW will "resemble its former glory" but I do highly suspect it will far overshadow retail WoW.
---
I think you're overselling streamers a bit. Classic WoW will draw in and create popular streamers. Popular streamers won't be the ones to create a popular WoW.
---
We've seen games time and time again try to game the system by paying the most popular streamers to stream their games. And after a month or two, those games almost all "die" at least on twitch. What matters more than anything is the quality of the game. Hype can help, but Classic WoW will be a big success even if none of the popular Twitch streamers touch the game.
---
Have people resolved the mystery of why Asmongold Reacts videos keep getting pushed in my face despite me clicking "I Am Not Interested" hundreds of times?
---
Not playing a dwarf as a priest is madness.
---
did he? i dont remember him until tbc
---
What is layering?
---
I love how you tought this was a good idea to post. Just how out of touch and low iq do you have to be
---
Jealous, maybe?
---
lol yeah i heard its quite boring to lvl pala, that explains that
---
remember, warriors also have the highest health regen of any class by quite a bit, so if you see a health regen clip of a hunter vs a warrior of course it'll be different.
---
Combat text should show amount resisted, of course it might be a combat text setting that needs to be toggled.
---
In the "OG vanilla" video link you provided, the guy is using a full suite of add-ons, including a font modifier...
---
Durotar is rough but the orcs can hang so they did. They embrace the rough upbringing and the trolls are safe there. Mulgore has a lot going on, but seems more peaceful and secluded. It's like you have a sense of a comfortable established homeland, then are thrown into rites of passage and danger away from home. It does make sense though, because the tauren have seniority on the continent.
---
It‚Äôs marketing. That‚Äôs all it is.  And you are donating to them.  It‚Äôs completely fucking insane.
---
If they play bot pervers and retail, Blizzard can ban them from retail.
---
Oh nice, they're really cool. Personally I would like to see one for Deadmines, that's just 'cuz I'm a Deadmines fanboy haha.
---
Take skinning and enchanting
---
Vendor skins AH Enchanting mats
---
So you get your two wands as warlock easy.
---
It will not be the fastest way but safes money until lvl 50 where i plan to switch to enhi and tailoring.
---
But i guess that depends on your class i will be a warlock.
---
See you in August then!
---
If anything I am glad they're using the exploit.
---
It lets Blizzard see what to check for and kill it before release.
---
After beta though, I do not condone such exploitation.
---
The way I see it is just adding a little bit of content isn't too much work - just some enemy models, instances and a few fights and bits of gear. However adding a major expansion to Classic but keeping it lvl 60 somehow would require a huge amount of game design work to not ruin the balance and feel of everything, it would be very difficult to add stuff without making existing content pointless while still making the new stuff worthwhile.   
---
If you do want to add a lot of content and keep everyone playing and paying by far the easiest thing to do is just give TBC the Classic treatment (possibly with no flying mounts or other small highly community approved changes) release it.  
---
The thing is if you go changing shit in vanilla, like trying to make meme specs good and add more content for pvp'ers and end game 5 mans and fill out cool spells really all you're doing is making a slightly different version of TBC. TBC is done, we know it's good and has a shit ton of content, might as well just release it.
---
Didn't they get flown out to play classic a couple weeks ago? He might have called fake because you were leaking nda announcements.
---
Well duh but lets be real we all know what they did here, it's a promotional stunt with a handful of red herrings so people cant get mad at them.
---
You might be right. I may be overestimating the effect of streamers. But again I ask, if we as gamers want classic wow, why aren't we playing more games like it? The vast, vast majority of private servers - which is easily accessible and free to play mind you - struggle to maintain more than a few thousand players. Nostalrius broke the mold and had a sizeable playerbase and is certainly an indicator of what classic can be but even so, Nostalrius - an easily accessible and free to play private server - had a fraction of the playerbase of the live game.
---
Don't get me wrong - I want classic to be a success and rejuvenate the dying MMO genre. I just don't think it'll happen. MMOs are niche enough and a slow 2004 style MMO at that? Blizzard will likely consider classic a success if they manage 100k semi-active players a year down the line.
---
As a mage you can do anything in the game extremely well.
---

---
So, when he bought a +4 stamina boots and equipped them, his hp hasn't changed. 
---
Remembering all the gear swapping shenanigans in vanilla, I'm pretty sure he were supposed to stay at 358 hp, creating a 40 hp gap at the same time that needs to be healed.
---
I noticed this on the scorpids outside razor hill. Now that I'm on to the barrens, I can't outrun mobs anymore. They're also actually dangerous here, unlike durotar where everything seemed pretty weak.
---
I'd planned to run with enchanting instead of herb, but someone told me that, in vanilla, you can disenchant any item regardless of your enchanting level?
---
So I figured I'd stick enchanting on a bank character and use them to disenchant and store mats for the AH?
---
Upvote for the "ive never played a druid, never even seen a druid".... for sure the definitive tier list!!!!!! 
---
A+++++ 
---
10/10
---
You dont, because you‚Äôre just blowing time playing a game and you‚Äôll be reset in three months anyway let the people who really care about bug reporting handle it
---
They are vintage now
---
If you're going with alchemy I figure that's a good shout. What class are you going for, if I might ask?
---
Just wondering if you're missing out at all by not opting for a prof that crafts items for your class/spec?
---
Can we drop this subject and let people play what they want? These "tier lists" just pressure people into playing classes they might not like to stay "competitive."
---
Not even skinning? Even just vendoring the skins still ups your income considerably and it's easy to keep it up with your character's level.
---
Not even skinning? :o
---
This is the dumbest post I have ever seen in this sub. Ever. Like WTF. I hope hes trolling. I really do.
---
Is it true that a level 1 enchanter can disenchant any item regardless of its level in 1.12?
---
Right...
---
Mmmkay
---
Glad to see we're still talking about Vanilla.  
---
\*rolls female night elf hunter furiously\*
---
Personally I don‚Äôt find it worth it.  The time you save by not doing it is worth hell of a lot more money at level 60, compared to the money you get for vendoring scraps.  But if you enjoy skinning then by all means you should skin.   Just my personal preference to not do it.   On my 2nd character I will probably do professions while leveling because I think they are fun :)
---
throwing knives #datwarriorlyfe
---
only streamers are still subbed to retail everyone else canceled their sub
---
Being a human instead of gnome wont be that big of a deal then?
---
I think raiders figured it out when bosses would hit you faster after your attacks were parried.
---
You cannot be a vanilla veteran and not heard the name Joana.
---
Created the first leveling guide and holds the world record 1-60.
---
Well yea, its not perfectly balanced, and i don't watch videos. I mean i could say that for many specs, not just Ret/Ench.
---
I mean, pretty sure they are actually just releasing more frequently over the same time they would have when it comes the the phases. There is only so much content after all. They went from 4 phases to 6 by spreading out the things they were going to release. It was about making a better experience for the players, not extending the time frame for money.
---
That is right BUT gathrring professions will be crowded. So enchanting makes sense qhen you go in alot of dungeona for the BoP Items.
---
Yet
---
Can you imagine the faction leaders all playing an MMO?
---
"Varian, does Anduin have his World Buffs up yet?"
---
"He's leading a group into Dire Wal-Mart right now. Give him a sec."
---
"When's he going to buy a new microphone?"
---
"When he's un-grounded."
---
"Is Malfurion on raid heals tonight?"
---
"I can hear you, Lady Proudmoore."
---
"Gee, I'm sorry, STORMRAGE, but maybe if you'd bother with it once in a while--"
---
"You were standing in fire. Why were you standing in fire?"
---
"Okay, everyone, I--ah, damn it. She's ganking the stone again."
---
"Sylvanas? She's still there?"
---
"Doesn't she have a life?"
---
Seems legit.
---
Ya I was in Krauns stream while him, plex, and UHD were rolling deep and they were testing the shit out of bugs and such versus certain "speedleveling WF 30, poopsock, zomg pogger champ Bois, monkaS" streaming types, not naming names. But let's all remind outselves what a testing beta traditionally is.  Now it's just a marketing hype tool :/ regardless great job &lt;APES&gt; keep it up guys
---
Hope not.
---
Several people have said this, but I wonder if it‚Äôs just a selection bias because every streamer is still a lowbie. I remember health regeneration being fast at low levels and slowing down as you get 40+ but it‚Äôs been a very long so I couldn‚Äôt say for sure what rate feels right.
---
&gt;You might be right. I may be overestimating the effect of streamers. But again I ask, if we as gamers want classic wow, why aren't we playing more games like it? The vast, vast majority of private servers - which is easily accessible and free to play mind you - struggle to maintain more than a few thousand players. Nostalrius broke the mold and had a sizeable playerbase and is certainly an indicator of what classic can be but even so, Nostalrius - an easily accessible and free to play private server - had a fraction of the playerbase of the live game.
---
I think I can answer this because I someone who want to play Classic WoW but didn't play on pservers until recently. Well, the reason I didn't didn't play was because I didn't know. I heard some whispers of people attempting to recreate Classic a few years ago, but nothing I read told me how to actually play it. Only after I actually did the research did I realize how to play on private servers. I wish I had known earlier, I would have loved to have been apart of Nost.
---
And the biggest reason I'm not playing more on pservers is because many of them have pay to win methods that cheapend any effort I put into my character. Also, the servers are not reliable and could shut down tomorrow without notice. We know for a fact the biggest pserver will almost certainly shut down when classic releases. So what's the point of getting so invested?
---
Also, many servers have a lot of bugs, especially bugged quests. Nothing like spending a lot of efforts only to hit a brick wall because something's bugged.
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong - I want classic to be a success and rejuvenate the dying MMO genre. I just don't think it'll happen. MMOs are niche enough and a slow 2004 style MMO at that? Blizzard will likely consider classic a success if they manage 100k semi-active players a year down the line.
---
Classic offers something that games like Fortnite can't offer its players. It offers the feeling of accumulated progression. If I put in 200 hours into leveling a priest to 60, that priest will be there for me whenever I want to play. I won't lose the power I built up. But with Fortnite, every match is reset. That chug jug is lost as soon as a match ends.
---
I think a lot of young players will feel the same way we did when we first play WoW. I was a counter strike player and even competed in CAL if anyone still remembers what CAL was. Fast paced games were not a new invention. We liked them equally back then as we do now. I had no interest in other mmos, everquest and such were pretty boring to me. WoW was different, it triggered something. I think young games today who are used to fast paced games will also have that feeling.
---
If they want meaningfull feedback I hope they do let Joanna in the beta, speed leveling gives you alot **alot** of knowledge about the entire game.
---
Ookkaayyy duuuddeee. Trueee
---
I suspect that if Classic is successful then Blizzard will probably open Burning Crusade Servers. Then, you can either server transfer your characters while those who prefer the "classic" experience will remain on Classic.
---
I haven't been this excited to play a game since the lead up to wow
---
Not at all, I fact it prob better that you don‚Äôt and also go into classic blind for that pure Vanilla wow experience:
---
Does the beta only last 24hrs?
---
I doubt it. Developing wow content is a huge undertaking. All respect to osrs but wow has a much higher standard.
---
Classic and modern wow are so different that it wont matter. Just brush up on some beginner tips for classic players on YouTube as classic has more noob traps than modern wow. All I mean by that is you can handicap yourself to the point of not enjoying the game (I.e. bad spec, not knowing which stats to prioritize).
---
Go play some hentai Korean MMO.
---
Does anyone know how big the client is size wise?
---
It's almost like the horde was meant to be a more Savage faction to appeal to people who want that, weird.
---
I have a huge bug, I didn't receive my key, anyone else?
---
Serious question: did all these streamers have to sub to WoW to get the invite? I know the majority of the vanilla advocates brag a lot about how they haven‚Äôt been subbed since wrath, BC, etc.
---
Your going to be subbed to play anyways what‚Äôs the big Fucking deal?
---
Then why is there actual fog and dense rain and why is it super dark during the night on pservers ?
---
no
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôd have to be out of combat to phase over since that‚Äôs how phasing works on retail.
---
Don‚Äôt respec or have a hunter alt to pay for respect.
---
This sounds like a streamer response but ok
---
No , it‚Äôs the same price for both, there are no discounts. Having 1 sub allows you to play either classic or current retail game. 
---
Yes you can jump straight in, everyone else is starting from scratch too, so a great time to start when classic is released.
---
Hi, /u/Der_Milly
---
In retail wow, you need to enable dodge, block, parry and resists.
---
Sure man ;) watching on a daily basis confirmed!
---
Hello,
---
1. You cannot get a discount, when you pay for the subscriotion you get access to both the retail WoW (Current) and classic servers (Which maybe in the future be the other expansions to).
---
2. I would say yes for the reason this is where it all began and for me vanilla WoW is the best to date, I have so many good memories from it. And I think I get what you mean with simpler, but you have to remember leveling takes longer, raids and dungeons was different to what they are today, you had no cross server realms, you had no lookig for group and raids, so you actually had to search for a party and then actually walk to the dungeon unless you had three people up there and one of them was a walock so they could summon you (later they introduced meeting stones, which did the walocks job).  
---
So yes I would always recommend people who had not played vanilla WoW to do it.
---
3. and I would say yes it is worth it, I don't play current WoW and I gladly pay for it just to get access to classic servers.
---
I came in here expecting this to be downvoted into the ground. You bring shame on this famiry.
---
That‚Äôs great. I‚Äôll definitely be playing it.
---
Gathering profs till 50‚Äôs anyway. I will take skinning till then, with prob herbs, then add enchanting later, maybe alchemy too.
---
I‚Äôm my guilds MT so I get to endure the pain that is warrior leveling.
---
No, I'm looking at Osmongold at level 15 right now, that regen is way off. In no way was it like this at 15. He NEVER eats, which we all remember we had to do, all the time. Full HP regen is like 20 sec of walking..
---
What what is wierd, is that this feature was present in the demo as well..? Making me unsure whether it is a blunder or they actually want it like this
---
Did you play Nost? The animation looks like it is locked, I'm sure if you play it at 60fps you will see what Classic WoW currently has
---
yea he has a healer lmao
---
**Breaking news**
---
This just in people shocked that only big streamers get in again to promote hype that will just use it to make money instead of helping fix bugs. 
---
More news at 11.
---
I tryed my best.
---
Ok. Hmm was hoping for an option to just subscribe for classic for like $10. I'll keep an eye on it and see when it releases. Looks like my type of MMO. I prefer PvE over PvP.
---
There is t even a game in the box it has a bunch of plastic   Shit and some bullshit cash shop mounts. (You will be able to buy the mounts in the cash shop)
---
The only reason to buy one is to sell it later for a huge chunk of money.
---
Nothing you listed is unethical.
---
Defcamp had rain and nighttime effects
---
They die when a replacement comes along. 
---
MySpace - Facebook
---
MSN/AOL - Skype/Discord
---
These formats still exist in a more modern way. 
---
 I‚Äôm hoping to find a video site similar to YouTube to post a few things related to classic that I just want to share wit my mates and not intend on making a career out of it. 
---
 Doubt it would work on YouTube though.
---
nah after he was fighting goretusks which actually should be doing a fuckton he would then regen like 15 hp every 2 seconds..not healing.
---
yep it's a bug
---
It is, he‚Äôs talking about the 15yeah anniversary box of retail wow trash and a statue
---
Skinning takes time after each kill, and it fills your bag faster forcing you to make vendor trips more often. You could make more gold simply by leveling faster and killing higher level mobs.
---
It's not super dark, WoW has never been super dark at night.
---
Here's Duskwood at night from a video posted in 2006:

Warrior, going for the same combo as back in Vanilla, for the memories mostly. 
---
I‚Äôm probably missing out, but at the same time I like dungeons, and will likely get the stuff I need from there. I‚Äôm not too worried about it, I‚Äôve figured it‚Äôs best I do what I want to and not what the min/max guide says is best. If I had more time to play I might of chosen otherwise.
---
The farm was shit though and a lead in to garrisons, but otherwise it was good
---
I suspect they anticipate most of their players will have current subscriptions anyway.
---
Same here. I get chills every time I watch the announcement trailer.
---
I stopped playing WoW years ago when I was a broke college student. It did consume a signficant part of my life back then, but I have so many fond memories that I still reflect on. Now, I'm 32, married, have no financial problems, but I do have a steady job. Hoping I can rejoin after all these years as a casual.
---
I can‚Äôt even imagine what your home life must be like for you to feel this strongly about a computer game.
---
I was watching Defcamp play in Tirisfal Glades and he had rain and nighttime effects
---
I've watched that stream a few times as it has popped up when randomly browsing Facebook... Her and Niko are a joke.  There are like 2 billion  people on facebook and the few times I've briefly watched it they have crap for viewer numbers.
---
I know right. If I‚Äôve time to watch a stream, then I‚Äôve time to play games myself.
---
I mean, thats how I did it in classic. Maybe he is going for the real OG experience ;).
---
It‚Äôs classic not a private server, the numbers will seem off of that‚Äôs where you are basing it on.
---
Petition to kys
---
downvoted :)
---
Yeah and a few months ago they literally said it would just be for starter zones, and only at launch. Now it's across the entire world, and for an entire phase which will likely be about 2 months long.
---
Why would anybody continue to trust their word on this? People predicted they'd move the goalposts again, and would you look at that? They were right.
---
A filter for "Classic" would likely be good enough.
---
Nice lil read before bed. Your big bro seemed like a great guy. I know he is happy for you and excited to watch you play this time around. Cheers
---
I think Blizzard will have some unobtrusive way of shuffling players between layers when a new one is created. So at 3K they might split it into 2K and 1K, and new players log into the new layer.
---
You can pay 15 bucks, play for 30 days and see if it's for you. If not, you (hopefully) didn't invest your life's worth into it and can get on with your life.
---
Why all this drama? You're literally trolling yourself.
---
Nothing, I say let‚Äôs wait and see how full the servers are in two years before we start worrying about what‚Äôs next
---
I feel strongly about and research every purchase I make before I make it, I boycott A LOT of stuff.
---
What I would do is when the game comes out, buy a month and try it out.  If you don't like it, you can use that same sub to try modern WoW and see if you like it (no need to buy anything but the sub to play everything up to level 110).  If you don't like either, you're only out $20CAD.
---
Fuck i didnt even know this was a thing. I totally would have bought this just for the statue.
---
Traitorous scum, I'll have your head on a spike
---
Yeah I can tell. You seem like a horrible person.
---
isn't a lot of the point of it (from blizzard's point of view) to bring back old players? not cannibalise existing retail customers? wouldn't old school players that have cancelled be the ideal candidates, because if they don't like it then it'll be a failure
---
I want my horde ugly.
---
Why, because I care about other people?
---
Would be nice if it wasn‚Äôt Alliance.
---
You‚Äôve posted like 50 comments to reddit in less than a day and you‚Äôre giving this guy shit? The kek is strong
---
No, no because you care about other people, because of your insane attitude to computer games.
---
A streamer?!?! Yet I‚Äôve not played since 2013? Aye ok! üôÑüòÇ
---
Blizzard's post yesterday said you needed to be subbed. I assume the streamers were all subbed anyway. I don't know about the ones who are only interested in Classic. I would assume the big streamers wouldn't need a subscription in that case but I don't know.
---
Yep. People said the same thing when they announced sharding for starter zones only, and look at where we are now. You'd have to be foolish to think they aren't going to change it again. When the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj event occurs, I guarantee they are going to shard or "lAyEr!!" the server again.
---
Reading this made me gay.
---
What are you people, 12?
---
No that text is Friz Quadrata font, I know it well.
---
That's something I'm excited too. Playing Vanilla without addons while certainly immersive... It's not too quality gameplay.
---
You may try to do quests only by reading the text but of you log out mid quest and come back tomorrow good luck remembering where you are supposed to turn in.
---
All good points. And I do agree that classic wow will certainly be different enough from the current mold to bring in some new people, especially young people who haven't really experienced its like before. I just don't think that it'll be that many. I think that you, using yourself as an example, represent a very small minority rather than average or even the majority. You know what you want and that is great. You'll probably be among the core of people still playing a year later. But how many of you will there be?
---
There is a reason the MMO genre is slowly fading away. It probably would've faded away much quicker if Blizzard hasn't made wow into such a beast. And while some will say that the changes to the game that Blizzard has made - made it quicker, more casual, more about instant gratification - is a BAD thing, the truth is they probably extended the life of the whole genre because of it.
---
I cannot see into the future but my gut still tells me what it has been telling me ever since classic wow was announced - huge launch, lot of hype flying around, a lot of good memories resurfacing, people are going to be excited. And then reality will set: this really is a more casual Asian style 2004 era MMO with all its greatness and its faults. It's immersive, it's social, to some it'll be new. But it is also slow, it's frustrating and it's unfair sometimes. I can envision a lot of people hitting the 10's, the 15's, the 20's and then going "wow this just isn't worth my time right now."
---
Ah, who knows. Hopefully I'm wrong. Just can't shake this feeling that it will be very niche down the line.
---
I think he has the most punchable face I've ever seen and no matter how many times I tell YouTube I'm not interested in any of his vids his crappy reaction vids still show up on my feed. Fuck him
---
How can you be up against both wotf and orc stub resist?
---
That's probably what I will end up doing. Not much info out about classic WoW and I just wanted some opinions from veteran players :D
---
"Yeah so I did all this sketchy shit, inflated my ping, and now my rogue can frontstab", sounds like a 'bug' to me.
---
Somebody has to keep the gates.
---
Now that we know we'll get our CE pets, we'll know the original fanatics for sure &lt;3 
---
Can't wait for my pet. I vividly remeber how I was delayed in leveling at launch because I had to investigate if the CE pet was a one-time thing for one char.
---
All their data for regen and everything is coming from 1.12. 1.12 was vanilla on easymode.
---
It seemed to me like it might have been off in some areas, like the valley of trials especially. I don't think I missed any attacks until level 5. But then I went to the barrens and fought kreenig snarlsnout at +3 levels and even I could barely scratch him, it was lots of miss, dodge, parry. That seemed right to me.

How are computer games any different than any other product?  If it's made in ways that treat human beings like garbage then isn't buying the product make you a participant in their poor treatment?
---
I don't see how it's any different from discussing the pros and cons of buying for example Dole products or Apple products.
---
People don't like shards. So they took sharding, tweaked them a bit, renamed it, and figured people would be stupid enough to not notice. I thought at first they might be like virtual servers, where each layer is essentially its own server from the client perspective, but unfortunately I was wrong.
---
Maybe not exactly, but its not an authentic or organic experience either.
---
&gt;So again, is Classic worth it?  
---
   
---
pay $15 and find out
---
Yeah but not as good for the publicity coach
---
When it's hate o'clock and you still haven't delivered the daily streamer-hating meme.
---
See, this is original content. Make one with the running baby in the yellow coat.
---
It isn‚Äôt any different, I hope you don‚Äôt have a similar attitude to employees of those companies either. It‚Äôs just disgusting.
---
I remember occasionally walking past people in weird locations talking to themselves. Makes a lot of sense now...
---
Show us on the dolly, where the bad Blizzard touched you
---
how will everyone know I played vanilla tho
---
I would like to see this, similar to OSRS and RS3 being very different games and now having seperated categories after Jagex streamed in the correct category finally
---
No sorry, this is a commubity that massively downvotes any ideas and basically everything that is not a golden retriever meme. It's gonna be awesome when Classic launches so I won't have to visit this cancerous place...
---
It took the community awhile to switch over as well you need the BIG channels to switch to make it effective else everyone will go where the people are
---
Gz to great boss.
---
Wasn't it Ion himself who originally said they were only going to shard the starter zones and only for a few weeks at launch? Well that was a fucking lie.
---
What happens during the the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj? Do you seriously believe they aren't going to shard or "layer" that? I'm sorry, but you're incredibly naive to think they aren't.
---
I vote against.
---
You do realize literally no one here can actually gatekeep anything right? If you are asking people to stop saying mean dumb shit on the internet, obviously that is not going to happen. That's the way it has always been and the way it will always be. Deal with it....or don't, doesn't really matter.
---
Kargoz didn‚Äôt get in? Wtf he‚Äôs the only ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù I like.
---
Well ofc, anything that gives them a hint on what can be exploited is what a beta is for. But they seriously think they can use it and not get  banned because they can on a private server.
---
I'd gladly give up an invite to Frost if I had one. His videos are great.
---
Hell yeah, he's going to join my guild and I'm going to show him how it's done. He played DaoC so he's hyped for the PvP.
---
Hitler was a horrible person, this guy only made a pro/contra list of a thing before he buys it. Relax.
---
Yes, Hitler was a terrible person.
---
But classic wow isn‚Äôt catering for the ‚Äúloyalists‚Äù, you have what you enjoy - retail game with easy access to all items and gold.
---
The folk who‚Äôve been asking for classic wow since early tBC are now getting what they asked for. They were ‚Äúloyal‚Äù wow players for many years before the retail snowflakes came along and wrecked the game with their constant spoilt demands for easy game play. üòÇüòÇüëç
---
About 4 gigs
---
No I don't, not toward the employees, they are just like me, regular person getting by, Its the heads of the business, the share holders and the decision makers and the business practices they implement that are boycotted.  It's because I care about the employees that I refuse to buy the products, thats the purpose of a boycott, it's to help the employees at the company you're boycotting, it puts pressure on management to change their ways.  "If you stop treating your employees like shit, I will buy your product."
---
There's roughly 3 months of beta. If it's a big problem, then I imagine they'll make adjustments accordingly.
---
pick the class that looks coolest to you, there are pros and cons to every class, and every class/spec will be invited to content (bar a few) so you won't miss out on anything.
---
hell ya, and that's the actual beta and not just going off what the size was in vanilla?
---
Ew
---
It seems like it shares files with your retail install. 9GB fresh from what I remember, significantly less on my machine that had BfA on it.
---
I can't find a good resource, but does anyone know if wow classic will be EXACTLY like vanilla wow? 
---
I mean, there is some room for improvement over vanilla wow, right? What about drinking after every mob, or many specs being completely non-viable? Or rogues/warlocks completely dominating pvp? Will these aspects remain unchanged too?
---
I'm pretty sure our memory is skewed. Most of our time spend back when leveling was 30-60 which is where the regens really start to fall off and it really turns into a grind.
---
I don't see how you could make an argument that getting children addicted to gambling to extract money from them is ethical.
---
The salt of all the morons in this sub is something to behold isn't it?
---
Only schedule and month widgets for me. Pixel 3 XL.
---
stop being mean to my friends! i mean influencers!
---
Hi, /u/BarbarBudvar
---
Shroud plays vanilla private servers and talks about vanilla wow a lot. It's not like he's some random person with no interest in the game.
---
Lol at only having 30 minutes to play. If I only have 30 minutes. I'm not playing any game. I'm unwinding with trash TV show and going to bed. And tomorrow I will try to manage my life and time better. Or keep my priorities straight.
---
I‚Äôll have you know i downvoted the golden retriever meme also
---
Our memory may be skewed. But this is definitely not 100% accurate.     To me it doesn‚Äôt really matter as long as the majority of the content is still up to par with how difficult/easy it should be, but I personally don‚Äôt quite care about low levels.
---
That was a guy called mccool, who was either mcconnell, his friend, or some random stream watcher who wanted attention.
---
So play the current retail since it seems to be what you want. Let us enjoy the "concept".
---
Lol
---
uh i'm watching staysafe and he's struggling way more than he is on private servers. Mobs seem way tougher, he mentioned them having more resist etc. His lvling speed compared to private servers is about 30% slower so far

When did they ever say not at all? In the restoring history panel they said they didn't know what they were going to do about sharding but it would probably be for the starter zones in the first few weeks. Now it's layering instead, which is significantly better.
---
I'll be doing three batches of beast grinds (Desolace, SoS and Badlands) for cash and drops for the AH (hopefully at least one nice BoE might drop too) for mount/BiS gear from the AH so skinning will make things considerably more efficient there. Will drop it around level 40 when I switch to tailoring for the Dreamweave set.
---
No one on earth wants 10000 people fighting for mobs
---
The font is not the issue (yes, fonts can be changed), the issue is the animation of the font moving up, and how crits dont ‚Äústick‚Äù as compared to 1.12
---
wowcrendor said in his most recent video that he kind of ended up convincing jesse while he was talking to him about it (and crendor himself didn't really "get it" either until he thought about it more and more)
---
That's fair enough and, to be honest, alchemy is often recommended regardless of class since you can sort out your raid consumables yourself and make a mint off of those who don't.
---
I expect them to pay my mortgage...
---
It‚Äôs only spells from the holy tree you can‚Äôt use in shadow form so you can check which ones are holy. From the top of my head you can use stone form, and I think feedback but no desperate prayer (it‚Äôs a buff so just reapply shadow form after). Desperate prayer just heals yourself.
---
His YouTube videos exist only for add revenue. Always just long enough but never enough content in them.
---
Ugly Horde is beautiful !
---
  "I know so many people who would have provided solid feedback for the beta" - do you think they want that? It seems to be that if you exclude someone like Joana you¬¥re trying to keep something away
---
Nice Troll, B-
---
I spent most of my time in vanilla playing with my now ex-wife, and I'm not sure I'll be able to play without her
---
Does this work with any weapons too? If so, you can swap weapons in combat for free heals.
---
Starshards are pretty crappy
---
If people who arnt retarded (to use your rude language) arnt tricked by it then why even have it? Clearly the average twitch audience does fall for this stuff.
---
Dunno
---
So was it normal for when you move within a zone (different camps) and such for the text that appears in the middle of your screen to be white?
---
real ironic coming from someone with that post history, jesus christ
---
Yup, it's just like the hearthstone/overwatch betas all over again (Can't believe how old hearthstone is now, I remember being so fucking hyped when I finally got a beta invite towards the very end)
---
Not that I can really fault blizzard on it, since streamers are basically free advertising. People like Joana not getting an invite is a damn crime though imo
---
nop, enchances it really
---
You don't need to provide data. BattleNet application agent may check it for you.
---
Will there be a meal on my kitchen table when I wake up tomorrow?  Idk depends if someone makes it and puts it on the table for me. :)
---
These are 2 questions with different context, mashed together.
---
At no point Blizzard said anything but possible TBC as a continuation.
---
Agreed wholeheartedly about gathering profs being overcrowded; I think it'll be difficult to find any herb nodes before Stranglethorn, lol.
---
I guess I'll see what others' experiences are. I might roll skin/ench if it really is all that bad.
---
Definitely. I bet beta will have mods soon
---
Let's not even touch on what most female streamers do for prime subs....
---
I just feel scammed that Blizzard gave me false hope and stole my $20 knowing full well the masses wouldn't be getting in. I'm going to call my CC and request a fraud chargeback tomorrow.
---
*Sigh* I just put it away too....
---
*retrieves pitch for from the mantlepiece*
---
Ye, all the main ones will be there for sure after 3 months of beta.
---
Idk about mobs not hitting as hard, that's probably headcanon, but the regen thing seems possible. People are 15 now though and it seems to have dropped off a bunch so I have no idea tbh.
---
Feminist about to destroy your spaceship my man.
---
Looking to do well at PvP, battleground especially but world PvP, too. Really want to make a difference, but currently conflicted between Dwarf Priest and Gnome Warlock. Anyone have any opinions about this? I mained a warlock from Wrath through Legion before turning to priest. I like the idea of healing but honestly I can't really decide; I know I want to play a caster but I'm torn between doing damage and healing.
---
Prot in BC was quite easy to level.
---
much, much faster than, say, a prot warrior in vanilla.
---
1. No
---
2.  Yes
---
3. Decide for yourself
---
Still no classic
---
Nah more of my hype is killed by the late release date. Over 100 days away
---
I hear ya, definitely hard to demonstrate with screen shots.
---
Question for those on the beta:
---
Do tracking abilities get deactivated by death? Do you have to manually reapply them upon resurrection?
---
Can you drag and reorder your characters on the character select screen like you can on retail or are they locked in the order you created them like back in vanilla?
---
That idiot hates Classic, hates it's community, is BfA shill who was hyping that trash expansion everywhere altough other beta testers with a brain already knew it's going to be shit.
---
But it was expected tho. He and his community of brainless shills defend every single decision Blizzard makes. It makes me really angry some people who have been passionate about Classic for so long didn't get invite, meanwhile this moron who makes fun of Classic meanwhile defending retail got in. Just shows how Blizzard trully cares about the actual feedback.
---
Hey I think I remember you. Yeah we should I've been thinking about playing classic.
---
Yeah that too. Just feels so far away
---
It kills is because of being envy
---
I‚Äôm going mining skinning on all three characters the whole time . I get it‚Äôs maybe in the end it‚Äôs fairly quick to go back, maybe a few hours, and just power level it, but with smelting so by your third character your hand me down ore is crazy. With Skinning, I mean, the thing is dead and right there so might as well. How skinning used to be is area based and so I feel like it would be cumbersome later, so might as well do it on the leveling. Always nice in Dungeons when you are the only one too. 
---
I plan to play port warrior, resto Druid,and resto shaman.
---
I think enemy mobs are doing less damage than they should.
---
Also believe that aggro ranges on hostile mobs are lower than what I remember them to be
---
It's not mean't to be a serious video.
---
Haha you agree?
---
The movement animation is something that is client related, not server. So it is completely fine to compare with private server. The client they are using is the vanilla client.
---
Load up a 1.12 private server client and see for yourself?
---
Whaaat how are people still sleeping on TBC
---
During original vanilla we had a NE shadow priest on my realm who seemd to turn up in the most unusual places to ambush people. Made me hate shadowmeld.
---
I genuinely despise him. He's the epitome of hypocrisy and would literally do anything to get more viewers and therefore money. Disgusting human being.
---
He's been bashing Classic since day 1 but all of a sudden his demeanour changed when he realized he can profit off it.
---
What a colossal fud.
---
A. What was your thoughts on Diablo?
---
B. There's no gambling in overwatch.
---
Gimme one bruh
---
&gt;The time you save by not doing it is worth hell of a lot more money at level 60
---
If you were grinding beasts all the way to lvl 60 (about 16000 beasts), skinning all of them would add 12 hours to your played.
---
This is the worst case scenario. If you quest and kill a mix of beasts and humanoids, you might add something like 3 hours to your /played.
---
It's not that big of a deal imo, especially if it allows you to buy your mount right at lvl 40 instead of several lvl later you will still be faster.
---
Dishonorable kills
---
If this is real I hope blizzard can track your account down and just ban you. I haven't read every line of TOS but I am sure you broke a ton of it
---
obviously you DO need an active sub to opt to the beta, money is money,honey.
---
How is he a sellout? I've watched a few of his videos over the past few months and he didn't come off as scummy to me.
---
Or do you mean just having attended that classic wow alpha press event?
---
It is basically over 3 months. It is that far away :(
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty lame for other people hope you get banned lol
---
There is no account cap, calling in and requesting game time is 100% allowed, and enrolling in beta participation is allowed on as many accounts as you purchase games for.  It is all legit.
---
Were those items that had suffixes on them like "of the owl" and "of the monkey?"
---
Dude you do realise that it is a BETA ? 
---
The idea behind is to try to push the limit of the game and find any inconsistencies/bugs/problems.
---
People SHOULD try to exploit bug and torture the BETA at their best possibility so it could be fixed for the launch.
---
Oh wow, it's looking nice and crisp.
---
I remember even in late BC having to drink between pulls on a new undead mage I made who was sub level 10. I can't imagine that health and Mana Regen yo-yo'd too much at that level range between late vanilla and BC.
---
Don't know this guy.
---
You didn't need to eat and drink between kills when you were level 5.
---
Nothing I did violated ToS or EULA.
---
Wanna share?
---
for those who keep asking(wondering). you DO need an active sub/game time in order to be opt-in for the beta.
---
blizzard already said it in their offical website.
---
Not entirely related question but don't want to make a post.  Unfortunately, my PC broke down months ago and I couldn't afford to fix it so I plan on using my Macbook Pro to play classic.  Pretty sure it runs 64 bit and I've run private servers on it fine but I know they updated the BFA WoW client quite a bit.  I know they are running classic on the same client.  Anyone know if I would be able to run classic on my Macbook?
---
So what do you plan to do with the other beta accounts than?
---
Against ToS/EULA to share accounts, otherwise I would.
---
Week 2 player here. Guess I'm in line. PepeHands
---
He's just joking. Why do you assume he's a toxic person because of that? I've been watching his stream since 2016 and he's been always doing shit like this just for fun, not because he's toxic.
---
I'm not fanboying or anything, I disagree with Asmon in many things. But on this one, he's just joking that's all.
---
Damn just wasted 6 other spots for other people very nice enjoy the ban lol
---
Grats! (In my jin-do voice)
---
Not much to do with them really.  I didn't think this would actually work -- I figured it was a done deal when I read the beta requires retail copies of games, I honestly was 100% sure the free base game wouldn't be considered a retail copy.  That has to be a bug.
---
His health went down really fast for someone being 4-5 levels higher, rare and elite
---
Could be that this beta is not really for testing as it is for hype/publicity.
---
What for unethical things does A-B?
---
I didn't violate the ToS/EULA.  Everything done was within bounds.
---
I don't believe so, google doesn't have the answer at least. I'd love to know what happened with his cult though, in 2016 they were literally housed in a compound using streams to recruit more mentally vulnerable people claiming they had the solution to all mental health problems.
---
Towelliee getting it meanwhile other people passionate about Classic didn't get it just boils my blood. That moron and his army of fanboys have been making fun of Classic since release. Trully shows how Blizzard actually "cares" about feedback.
---
Yeah no. You provided fake emails and I am assuming names to make it not to "suspicious"
---
When you create or update an Account, you must:
---
provide Blizzard with accurate and up to date information that is personal to you, such as your name, address, phone number, and email address.
---
Rest in peace Mrs. Corpse.
---
We dont have to tell anyone :)
---
Not your weirdest either, admit it !
---
Say what now?
---
What's your stream? Love streams like that
---
hey i sent you a PM :)
---
This actually is the case priest buffing stamina in BFA too. Stamina buff effectively heals you if you don't have it yet and I don't think that was ever intended in the first place, works in combat too.
---
All of my personal information was not faked.  The only thing I said was don't make spammy/fake sounding emails, or ones with incremental numbering.  That was solely to guarantee the game time.  The GMs could have easily searched my personal info and find my other battle.net accounts, even my legit retail one.
---
So your plan is to grief people you believe the bliz administration likes. Tell me how that works out for you
---
Can we please remember that it's only day 1? Just because the streamer you wanted didn't get in doesn't mean they won't - there will be more waves of invites. The Blizzard-hate circlejerk in this thread is just immature.
---
I know 3 of them for sure who are salty inside for not being part of the initial wave, although they are (to my knowledge) being classy about the situation.
---
Regen is very high below level 15 due to it's flat initial scaling  and low hp/mana pools at low level.  You will totally feel the heat around lvl 15.
---
Down voted for an opinion, classic reddit
---
Indeed. I have had fun going through all my old accounts, so many toons. And memories. :-)
---
It's against tos/EULA to deliberately profit or exploit bugs and glitches for personal gain iir.  You just breached dude ;)
---
If it was a new expansion I would usually level my healer first, but this time I‚Äôm going Prot Warrior first, resto Druid second, warlock third. 
---
Prot warrior is fun tank and solo and will be easy to level in dungeons. Hopefully from running uldaman for 20 levels I‚Äôll find some people to raid with once I have level capped, and  probably will make a guild. Once you have high level friends and a guild it‚Äôs far easier to level a second character.
---
I‚Äôll go healer second cuz people always need heals. And then when those two are waiting on raids I‚Äôll level the lock which is strong for solo, pvp and pve. I‚Äôll be in a guild so I‚Äôll never miss the battle. 
---
That‚Äôs the plan anyway. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be jumping in 2/trade lfg like the rest of ya.
---
This seems like a solution to something that is not a problem.
---
Just go to the wow category and check out the top streams to find classic.
---
This. We are just humans, it will pass.
---
Fairly sure if you used false information for the accounts it violates the ToS.
---
Ofc it will not be that big of a deal
---
Oy vey, they know
---
He have his own leveling videos from the past. He can be really helpful restoring Classic.
---
Yeah, a little if I am being honest but I also feel there were a few streamers that deserve it a little more then few on there like [ https://twitter.com/FuriousPaul_/status/1128792634301014016](joana)
---
What the literal fuck.
---
&gt; provide Blizzard with accurate and up to date information that is personal to you, such as your name, address, phone number, and email address.
---
How would it ruin it, though? Unless it's automated (which they've said they're looking into) then it literally isn't any different from just reporting them normally.
---
Staysafe managed to keep 2 targets feared as a warlock, with said spell : Fear. 
---
Bug.
---
Day 1 CE, midnight launch, every expac and subbed continuously. NADA.
---
I suspect random.
---
Don't forget druids have only one rez every 30 min.
---
There is absolutely nothing stated about creating accounts for beta invites.  That subsection also relates solely to the game itself. 
---
Also, there is no profit nor personal gain to be had by this.  I took legal routes to increase my chances, sure, but I didn't exploit anything.  Everything done was by the books, even involving speaking with a GM on multiple occasions.  All of my personal info on the accounts was my accurate real life information, had they searched for it they would have even found my retail version of WoW that I've had since 2004.
---
That's exactly me, but as man. And a tear dropped
---
This thread is all the evidence you need
---
What do you mean by gatekeeping? Or what exactly is going on in this sub in that sense? I'm seriously asking ^^
---
Not until way late.. what was the island where everyone did dailies? I remember running those for a minute before they patched prot pally to be good, it would take a couple hours.. because then they took off in pvp too.
---
I think you're right, and I can only truly speak for myself. I could never predict the success of games like candy crush or other popular mobile games. I can't even predict the success of Wii games. But I do think that when it comes to PC games, the platform I spent most of my gaming life on, I have a pretty decent instincts about the success of games. For example, when I first saw Fortnite in October 2017, I seriously suspected that it would far surpass PUBG (which was the Fortnite before Fortnite in terms of popularity). And I believe that going forward, Fortnite will be unmatched in the genre for the next 3 years at a minimum. New games may surpass Fortnite in streamer views for a month or two, but Fortnite just got the formula so right, that you can't really improve on it. Fortnite is like the coca cola of its genre, it's timeless.
---
I believe Classic will be a tier or two below Fortnite, but it will still be effectively timeless for the next 3-5 years. I don't think the next two retail expansions will be able to match Classic's base for any meaningful period of time. In fact, I think the lack of relative success of the next two retail expansions may even lead Blizzard to abandon that "timeline" and build on Classic's again.
---
I also believe that Classic will not be as streamer friendly of a game as games like Fortnite. Classic is something that is far more enjoyable when played than when watched in a stream that I believe the streamer count will undersell how popular Classic will be. Games like Fortnite can be downright unenjoyable if you are unskilled. That's why watching good streamers is so popular. But WoW is a different beast. You can find as much enjoyable fishing in a lake in WoW as you can watching the world's best raid teams setting world record firsts. So I don't think streaming will reflect WoW's popularity the same way Fornite or other action games do.
---
?? You don't have it
---
It think the exposure is good for weeding out the bugs.
---
No information was falsified.  All of the personal information matches up 100% to my retail account that has been active since 2004 to the letter.
---
Hi, I'm Dave, and I'm a WoW -A- Holic
---
Also, i was doing quests n stuff for levelling. Not doing any sort of min/max type.  Everything took forever to kill
---
All personal information is 100% accurate and matches my retail account to the letter.  Nothing was falsified.
---
Welcome Dave! Have a seat
---
It's because you're not sub I think.
---
But I'm like 80% sure
---
That's the 8.2 BFA PTR
---
Blizz bans accounts for charge backs
---
Thank you. Can I ask a question?
---
Lol I did the same thing on my account
---
u mad?
---
You know Blizzard can ban you even if it's not a violation of the ToS right? They can ban you for anything they want, this is absolutely something they would ban someone over
---
But they are supposedly rolling out more invites throughout the next few weeks, gradually sending them out to subscribers. Just wait for the next wave.
---
&gt; Can you drag and reorder your characters on the character select screen like you can on retail or are they locked in the order you created them like back in vanilla?
---
I'm guessing you are against reordering. If I'm correct, care to share your argument against it?
---
Speaks volumes about you when you call other opinions "retarded".
---
Be a good tester and report anything you see wrong from what you can remember what was in vanilla. Don't stop reporting.
---
First thing I did when I realized people would be streaming was check his stream, dude is an absolute legend.
---
Of course they can, my accounts are technically their property after all.  I reported this happening to them yesterday after receiving the invites, so I guess time will tell if I am banned or not, or if they even care.
---
Boo-urns
---
Oh come on the d3 team are traitors, shouldn‚Äôt have released crap in the first place if they didn‚Äôt want to get slashed. Can‚Äôt believe you defend them

Just because you did it in Classic doesn't make it the "real OG experience." I personally never clicked my abilities and I've played since 2005.
---
Short : NO
---
Long : NNOoOoOoOo
---
gotta raise the bars somehow
---
I did just play wc3 and read all books till (including) Arthas, so I am already prapared.
---
Now I read chronicles 1 and it was a blast, I got a great overview of how the world was shaped. Reading chronicles 2 now and wondering when classic will start in those books.
---
I know that chronicles 3 go as far as cataclysm, which is why I asked here how far I can read to not spoil what happens in classic.
---
You didn't get it man, that's not Beta
---
It's better for the game if it's lumped in with the live version, which will continue to be more successful post Classic launch to the general public.
---
That's a huge stretch, dude.
---
Why did they get TPd?
---
People are hating, but I just find it very clever. Enjoy beta
---
Dont the chronicle books go as far as cataclysm, hence spoil every story until then?

Good for you random stranger
---
I don't know where you are from but in Germany not every part of the contract has to be in writing. There can be unwritten (basically implied) parts to it. 
---
Creating that many accounts in bad faith (once again not sure about the technical term here) can't be intended by Blizzard. 
---
In Germany that would probably suffice for a breach of contract if not a termination of the contractual relationship.
---
Starshards is really bad, feedback is also really bad. Nightelves in general get really bad racials, only shadowmeld is somewhat useful. The whisp is nice while leveling but if you're doing group content it just makes you wait longer for your team.
---
Been subbed since beta vanilla, no invite, went to check beta settings, wasnt signed up for classic, oops :'(

Talking about him
---
Some might even say keep the gates
---
Arena was right up there.
---
Even if you're not 100% sure it's a bug, report it so it'll atleast get their attention. That's literally what the beta is for.
---
This is lit bro thanks 4 that will definitely get it
---
This is satire, or bullshit
---
Wtf did i just watch....
---
...what is a "fake" email? If he can receive email on it, it's legit. 
---
Sure this sounds like a bit of a dick move to take slots away from real beta participants going that far, but the dude didn't really do anything wrong.
---
It's nice for those of us not in to know what's going on though.
---
would you rather play an overhyped game that is not tested well.
---
Or a well tested game that is not full of over hyped people?
---
What kind of computer do you have? Is it low end? Blizzard is known to let people with low end computers in to test hardware
---
If health regen works even remotely close to mana regen, then that doesn't seem like such a huge number, warriors had like 30-40 hp per tick at 60 and nothing to scale it other than their base stats.
---
They still shit on rogues. Even with Flare fixed.
---
Also, think about the fact that "guilds" are on same layer. It only means the in-game guild feature. In reality a guild is in discord and can just create many in-game guilds to populate different layers and hop by partying. Why isn't this immediately addressed anywhere?
---
People who didn't play vanilla WoW aren't allowed to participate in the beta.
---
Streamers who have legit fun have to be avoided at all times because that isn't the intended way of having fun *their* way.
---
When reading 70% of the comments in this sub people are angry towards everything when something isn't going *their* way.
---
Layering is bad, because it wasn't in the original game.  
---
All this paired with toxicity is really bad.
---
No, not at all. It builds hype
---
Haha have fun on the PTR ;)
---
I also liked his warlock deep dive. As i'm planning to main a lock, the video really helped me. Other than that, I really don't know the guy.
---
Retrowow is some clunky, buggy shit. And the battlegrounds are always a group of noobs in blues vs full premade T3 group, all day long.
---
Level 40??? LMAO, dude.. I can understand it being quick until level 10.. maybe 15, but Ive always played casters and I had to sit my ass down and drink between every single pull from level 20 and up, for sure.  
---
Sure I was being reckless with my mana too, but mana regen is waaaay too high now.
---
Add-ons are currently disabled. Macros are simple right now, no one has done a deep dive because they're all too busy memeing to their audience.
---
I think there is more of an overlap between viewers and players between both games than you‚Äôre giving credit for. When classic releases many of the top twitch streamers will be playing it, soda and asmond will be carrying it to top 5 total viewership already if they‚Äôre both online. I know a lot of retail players that would love to jump ship completely, and there are many that will play casually since they already have a sub. Those who prefer the more complex raiding / dungeon mechanics and are members of hardcore guilds will probably play both. On the flip side people coming back to classic after a long time may try out 8.2 BFA and find they like it assuming blizzard can fix a lot of the early problems this expansion had. I predict the azsharas eternal palace world first race will garner a lot of viewership, and retail won‚Äôt be dead on twitch. Likewise after a few months after the FOTM variety streamers quit playing classic that viewership will probably drop too. 
---
I think we should look at the games as healthy competition, hopefully they can grow from each other.
---
True.
---
Achievements are awesome and improve longevity of the game, things like the Dungeon and Raid Achievements add extra difficulty and challenges to fights. The problem is people refusing to play with others who have not already done the content, achievements simply give them that knowledge. Of course having guilds gets around this, I also wouldn't be surprised if people come up with an addon to track it in the end. 
---
That said Achivements could easily be improved by just cutting out certain ones, and heavily stripping down the title rewards.
---
No actually, I'm for it.
---
I'll most likely be rolling a main and two banking characters (the second will be for the Steamwheedle AH) on launch day, and I'd hate to think that I'll have two lvl 1 characters up the top of my character list ahead of any alts I roll in the future.
---
If i remember correctly the nodes are not shared.
---
So even if 50 people can jump around only one guy will get the node ;)

They could have left it as just the farm and it would have been fine. It was great for extra chance at resources and didn't give you everything. The problem with freaking MOP was everything was a rep grind, you could only do so many a day (IIRC), and it was all gated behind the rep.
---
My theory is we got teleported by a GM as an April fool's joke. It was still the 1st on the west coast. But really, nobody knew lol. This wall was hundreds of players and stretched further than the visible area over the southern mountain range bordering the west. Still being in the classic mentality, most people took it really well.
---
Did I piss you off? Ctfu
---
You just gotta say it in every thread though. Also DAE le right click reporterino?
---
good video dude reddit is usually angry tho
---
Someone on my team has taken off Aug 26th - Sept 11th, 2 and a half weeks starting the day before release. They don't game, so i'm assuming it's a family holiday.
---
Actually contemplating changing employer and just telling people in interviews i have a holiday booked Aug 27th right now.
---
hopefully phase 6 starts after 2 years of launch
---
WotLK had years of building on vanilla and TBC, attracting more players doesn't automatically make it better. It's impossible to know if classic would have attracted the same number if t hadn't changed to TBC.
---
TBC was rushed, half the raids didn't work correctly, people whined in vanilla about there being no enemies from Warcraft 3 so they made characters who weren't originally edge villains into them (IE, why everyone hates Illidan).
---
It's about that compounding interest tho, having skinning for just a couple levels early on gives you more bag space, which gives you more money which allows you to buy bigger bags sooner, which earns you even more money.
---
What do you mean false hope?
---
Blizzard never promised you a beta invite because you have an active subscription, they said it‚Äôd be a chance at an invite. What they said is crystal clear and it sounds like you simply didn‚Äôt understand it.
---
It's only a bummer because I can't watch a high quality stream without hearing an an obese hairy man (esfand) in the background of every stream. I guess I can watch on mute and cover it with bloodbath.
---
I am playing on a low pop hungarian one, which is great vanilla exp, there is like 40 of us, we need to stick together, to progress, and help each other out all the time, pretty fun :)
---
I'd rate arena well above barber. Most people wear helmets anyway. Whereas area was the LFD of the pvp world, and totally annihilated the 'massive' part of MMO.
---
Probably going to take them ( miming/engineering) from the Start and do them when/off it‚Äôs convenient, then at 40 when I get my mount catch them up.
---
Sure Dave, we're all friends here
---
Lmao, when it turns out they actually did have their contacts and were invited to a secret beta üòÇ
---
The queue to log in would be massive, LOL
---
Not going to be in classic
---
What do you think about the main idea tho not logistically
---
I know it will be awesome but I don't know why people forget the netiquette on the internet.  
---
Just because it is a forum it doesn't mean you need to be rude or make exaggerated claims about the game..
---
That makes sense. Suppose I'll just wait then.
---
What do you mean it's marketing?
---
friendly reminder that as alliance you will win AV like 95% of the time so it evens out
---
Iirc lfg/r was introduced at end the tail of wotlk
---
That's the thing. There was no 'chance'. They knew the criteria, and it wasnt a roll of 1-N number of accounts and if it  matches your id you're in. So they were just fishing for subs.
---
Pick up skinning and mining at my earliest convenience, if I'm doing well with my mining skill I'll keep leveling it and pick up engineering to start making bombs/grenades, if not I'll just ignore professions other than first aid.
---
Shroud is a classic player. He's probably more deserving of the invite than most people casually browsing this sub.
---
He played during vanilla.  
---
He plays on private servers.  
---
He has openly said that he ia excited about classic and that he will be playing and streaming at 60.
---
And he has a stupidly large following, it would be crazy for you not to want him to advertise the game.
---
Shadow priest and warlocks are godly in 1vs1. overall good classes for pvp.
---
But another thing to get into consideration is taht you will have to probably heal with the priest in the pve content if you go this route. 
---
Not a mandatory choice but it's easier to find groups and you'll have a lot of /w to ask you to heal
---
=)
---
Beta invites have always been a rolling release. Stop bitching if you don't get an instant invite, you'll get one eventually.
---
Sure que times might be long, but streamers can just que before stream starts if they are vigilant and others can wait if they truly wish to play with a streamer.  Would cause massive rivalry when they see people in guilds specifically for a streamer. Game of thrones style

If frontstabbing works that way, frontshredding probably also works then and that increases dps of feral really well making leveling speed a lot faster.

I've got this weird taste in my mouth. It's as if everything is salty. Why is everything so salty!? ::breaks down into tears::
---
I believe Staysafe and Tips are doing this already. But yes, I agree they should all be quarantined in their own servers
---
Exactly :)
---
Mouseover macros was possible in vanilla.
---
Do DPS second so you can farm with that character to suppliment your warrior and your healer later.
---
Has to be bodies by drowning pool.
---
The fire would be 1000 times smaller, he looks like a tiny figurine now
---
How so? 
---
There‚Äôs plenty of people who played Vanilla that didn‚Äôt get invited today, while there were also plenty of random folks that did. They said they would be adding more and more people over the coming days, so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if today was only a small invite wave to start with and make sure everything is functioning properly.
---
^ fearing mobs into walls, causing them to LoS
---
Lok'tar, friend. What is it you wish?
---
Shut the fuck up
---
If late august is what they need then so be it.
---
What strikes me the most is how everyone and I mean literally everyone has played wow in vanilla.
---
He started during vanilla why is this rumour still going?
---
Probably because you show your real name to reduce the tOxIcItY
---
man she's just an awful person. She went from calling anyone who likes Vanilla a loser to being like "haha guys I always was supporting Classic" after the Blizzcon announcement.
---
She even made very serious false accusations against Mark Kern. She said he threatened to rape her and that he sent his followers to harass and threaten her. He didn't even know who she was until the accusations started flooding in.
---
after 7-8 hours most of them are under 20, how is that not hard?
---
a pirate server player thinking he has any right to pontificate about "ethics", y i k e s
---
Shhhh, everyone on this sub either hates current WoW, or has hated it since TBC. You're apparently not allowed to like both since they play differently. Only reason I care is to hope we'll eventually get progressive servers and relive a lot of the expansions again (hopefully not broken this time). As much as I enjoyed Vanilla the first time around, I really dont think it can survive forever without them doing "wipes" so people can keep racing. (People have been playing vanilla for years, well sure, but probably not 24/7 and after several wipes, or fun servers where people got to play as the npcs)
---
It's hard in the sense that it's not faceroll.  Play stupidly and you'll pay the price in time and repair costs.
---
And the framerate is definitely faster than the 15-20 we were getting on our Dells back in 2004. Smoother frames=smoother feeling travel?
---
If logistics were put aside, I think that it would be the best option. Pairing streamers on opposite faction would be best for entertainment value for us plebs, lol
---
Keep drinking that soy milk
---
We should put a Basketball court in the club. So we have something to do until release.
---
I read nearly every post on this sub in the last days because I am hyped and stoked for peoples opinions. But why does everyone forget just because it is a forum you should reply nicely? Like a normal person would talk to you?  
---
It does matter. This community here names themselves *the* classic community. This is a subreddit for a fucking video game, we should all be happy that we are going to play classic and that Blizzard didnt fuck vanilla up like they did with retail. Where is all the negativity coming from?
---
if u dont care for tanking or healing than mage is a safe bet
---
pros: 
---
u make your own food and water
---
u can teleport to cities making travel around the world less problematic
---
u can aoe farm
---
u are strong in pvp in your lvling spec(if u lvl as frost)
---
everyone will take a mage into a dungeon - a party with 3 mages +tank and heal is a great composition
---
u have most option for money making - ppl are making gold as mages just selling portals in kargath(if u are horde) - u can farm brd , u can farm dire maul when it comes out or zg trash for jujus . u can aoe in wpl u can solo farm elites in chapel for crusader or even run maraudon solo - and the only requirement for some of those is enough mana , mage is ultimate moneymaker when it comes to low investment 
---
cons:
---
raid rotation involves lots of frostbolts lol(its slightly more than that lol but not rly) - however fire spec for aq and naxx is not bad at all
---
u wear a skirt ? i cant find more cons
---
hunter is also not bad but ppl will take mage into the group over hunter
---
Hey folks, is it safe that blizz releases more invite waves  ?
---
Have you considered playing a druid? It might provide that roguey feeling of stealthing around and having energy in cat form while at the same time they are great support healer class and very much needed in raids. They can tank and heal every level appropriate 5man dungeon aswell with no problem.
---
Oh c'mon. They are sub 30. The real hump is yet to come
---
But you missed the point.
---
Thank you for clarifying! 
---
That doesn't sound like a nice thing to do especially if the goal should be to also make people feel welcomed who haven't played classic before. 
---
Doesn't make us as a classic community look very good
---
Aren't the addons disabled in beta?
---
No thanks
---
Or the respawn while you're eating. Or some asshat pulls a bunch to you after they died trying to run away.
---
Just don't make a burning one please :o
---
While it should be in there, a lot of unit frame adding support it anyways
---
Yea, watching some of the best retail players in the world die 15 times before level 10 clearly shows it's easy as hell.
---
Weather effects and darker nights are non-existent.
---
Oh cool, this thread again.
---
Oh shit, here we go again.
---
Honestly I wish Blizz would just do "channels" like a lot of online games did a while back, if they're going to do any of this nonsense in the first place. At least let me pick to switch to a different shard or layer or whatever they're calling it this time *if I feel like I need to*, and only as long as the system is deemed necessary. 
---
Hiding it all behind smoke and mirrors annoys me because I have no control over who I see. I'm at the mercy of Blizzard to get it right 100% of the time and we all know what sort of disappointment you're in for when you expect that. 
---
Frankly I just don't think Blizzard is up to the task of processing so many people in one area, so while they say it's to make the experience better for us, it's really just because they've not bothered actually improving their systems to accommodate so many people. It's always been a bit crummy when too many people are in one place, but if anything, Blizzard has gotten worse over the years instead of better. Just look at what happens if you bring a raid to a capital city, the server straight up dies. At least before, you could make it happen even if it was a bit laggy.
---
time consuming sure, hard? no!
---
Very funny.
---
Shhh! Let him download and install. I want to see his next post.
---
what is playing stupidly? sodapoppin is pulling 2-3 mobs at a time it's fine
---
you mean the tank and spank dungeons?
---
who are you watching dude?
---
Are the stress tests open to the public? Or do you need an active WoW sub to play?
---
You have to have a sub and be opted-in to the beta. So $15 gets you a *chance*.
---
Just hide in the library, in stormwind nobody goes there anyway.
---
The world is beautiful, but it's crumbling ... best description of Retail WoW ever.
---
it's probably how they track what skills you can use/what rank you can use. Similar to how you can buy an epic mount, but without the training you can't use it, this way they prevent the error of you not being able to use the skill by auto leveling your skill level.
---
omg. I just checked my beta settings. I didn't realize they made Classic WoW a separate category. Fuckkkkk
---
I don't mind streamers getting in if there were more people to populate the world in general. Watching streams, they barely see other players.
---
I'm not trying to be facetious, but if he really isn't sure what the text looked like back in 1.12, won't a 1.12 client show him?
---
He is going to bring some spergs with him.... Good
---
Because beta
---
If the leveling is the only thing that scares you just pick the warrior.
---
Rogues are farly close to warriors when it comes to leveling QoL, until very late levels when you unlock your full toolkit, in the beginning ou just a leather wearing fury warrior that can stealth.
---
The warrior also get some love durring leveling for dungeos (if you plan on running some while leveling). You will be invited in already formed groups withe a /w "Hey man wana do SM ? we only need a tank." 
---
So not downtime to forming a group!
---
But i'm planning to play a war so my advicde might be slightly biased :p 
---
In the end of day you'll spend hundreds of hours on you char so pick what you feel the best class suted for your playstile !
---
Yeah, just browse through the top posts of the last days and read the comments.   
---
It is all about "shills, paid beta access, layering, launch date". 
---
It saddens me that people are that 2-faced. Toxic on the internet knowing there won't be anything that holds them back and probably normal dudes IRL.
---
AutomaticJak
---
Because tipsout has more knowledge of the game than Joana has /s
---
You are every right. The Blizzard we knew is dead and was dieing ever since they merged with Activision.
---
Gaming in general is also in a terrible place. You cant trust the big publishers anymore. You basically have to buy a game a year after release to get the complete package for a good price.
---
That said, I will play WoW Classic because it is a good game and it has been a long long time since I could play a game for hours at a time.
---
You kidding?  Joana is great publicity, someone who played hard when it was fresh hypes up the fan base which in turns brings back players who quit.
---
Perhaps I am yeah, but it does seem silly that you could for example camp herb/ore spawns on both layers by abusing invites.
---
Even in BDO where you could do multiple world bosses by swapping channel there was a cooldown on how frequently you could jump. I'm going to hope you can only jump once every hour or so.
---
There should be some consequence for jumping layer or else people can literally just farm double the mats with the help of a friend.
---
So he can be an ass and hide behind his ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt buy into this.  I know nobody asked my opinion, but this gets under my skin a bit.
---
Thanks for bearing with my rant and please don‚Äôt take it as a personal attack at you.  More an outcry at the culture of this.
---
Petition to stop this petition
---
Expect anything from these animals. I was down voted for saying that not clicking your spells wasn't a factor in getting the "real OG experience." So I used to play Vanilla but always had key binds. Does that make me less of an OG? xD
---
No. In your case it seems like it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
That last one hit me right in the feels as well...
---
If I have sub time, but it's set not to renew does that count?
---
LOL!
---
It‚Äôs not wort it, beta closes today it‚Äôs only 2 days long
---
Error 37 ‚Äì fun not found
---
The heavy rain and fog is a huge factor in the atmosphere while leveling through Teldrassil and Darkshore. I hope everyone on the beta is reporting this. 
---
The game is about more than the right damage numbers for mobs and armour.
---
So long as it's active, it counts.
---
You know, I literally just tuned in to him after reading your comment, only to see him almost die to 3 mobs while in a 2 man party.
---
I'd imagine so. They said the requirements included an 'active subscription'. So as long as you have some time (like via a game card) you should be ok.
---
But yeah -- you're still only getting a *chance*. No guarantee you'll get a beta invite.
---
Well. with absolutely no information on what is important for you, we can't decide for you either. Or actually i can. You roll a human rogue. You are welcome.
---
And he's died plenty.  He toes the line pretty close.  But he also knows what he's doing; any average player would not fare as well.  "Hard" doesn't always mean "difficult."  Sometimes the challenge comes from knowing your limits and playing optimally.
---
Tool is supposed to be releasing their album on the 30thof August as well. So not only is classic coming back out, updated, but so isn't my playlist.
---
Lmao u guys love hating streamers
---
Why do it even compare to private servers? those servers have it wrong most likely. Blizzard said the regen numbers are same as in vanilla.
---
I am able to run the current retail client on my 2012 MacBook Pro (albeit at moderate settings), I think with classic‚Äôs lower intensity you should be able to run it
---
Isn't it that if 6 players are together you are already on the same layer, so inviting to groups will keep you in the same layer anyway.
---
I mean the xp requirements.
---
Ok thanks for the reply!
---
I was skeptical at first but the ending really pulled the analogy together. Well done.
---
Don't sweat over it dude, you have some toxic player everywhere.
---
But it's normal not knowing what to do etc, this is a part of Learning curve! 
---
Just pick the class that pleases more to you, some people will be kind to teach you some tips &amp; trics on your path to 60.
---
Again I can't insist enough you will be the one behind you char for hundreds of hours! Play whant feels right to you.
---
Joana is great publicity for the people who are already going to be playing classic wow.  Fortnite bros are meant to get new players, younger players.
---
Going Lock with cooking, first aid, tailoring and herbalism. I'll save the herbs for once the server matures and it's worth selling on the AH. 
---
Since level 40 mount is cheap, I don't needed to worry until the grind for the Lock mount quest.
---
I am having fun watching some streamers 
---
I rather donate to streamers than paying to watch a movie, buy some game or drinks
---
I do not see anything wrong with it
---
Old players are where the money is for classic.  Fortnite players are for retail.
---

All good, just explaining the situation. He's actually a nice guy if you meet him IRL, or so I've seen.
---
You need both Warcraft and Warcraft Classic boxed =O
---
Not needed, thank you
---
More eyeballs on Classic the better. I want as many people to try it and play it as possible.
---
TipsOut is a piece of garbage. 10 min videos, 4 ads, check.
---
Reading blue posts with no input, check. Did not even play vanilla, check. Personality like a dead fish, check. Yeah, I dont really like the guy. Not sure why anyone would.
---

---
Been watching Asmongold for the last hour and the damage looks totally legit to me honestly.
---
Don't agree with paladin and priest, I think they're better than you suggested.
---
Who cares... it's only $15 a month and you can see if you like it in the first week.   
---
Nobody is asking you to donate one of your kidneys to play, you're being melodramatic.
---
Some of my fondest memories are the downpours in STV and the fog and rain in AB.
---
adderall
---
He is stalking you, report him and block him.
---
Old players are basically guaranteed at this point, though.  Why waste time preaching to the choir?
---
Well when most people here refer to Classic as hard, they're referring to the park that they enjoy the most, which is usually the Dungeons and raiding. It's pretty much universally known that leveling takes time but it's not really difficult.
---
\#towlie lasting like 2 hours

Bruh you Know what you signed up for

Done, ty.

This, that's why priest with wand spec was a thing. Dot, wand with shield up. Dot, wand with shield up. With spirit tap you could throw some heals or dmg spells once in a while.
---
Otherwise it was all drink.
---
If that‚Äôs the case, that‚Äôs cool and I hope it is true.  :)
---
Te gay Elves and the blue space goats belong in TBC, just sit quietly on your ass and wait your turn when Blizzard launch TBC servers, don't ruin the game for us.
---
Can confirm, I got my invite email around 21:50 CST.
---
Day one account, but I haven‚Äôt subbed since TBC. Just recovered this account a few days ago actually and resubbed to check my characters.
---
They even re-implemented that bug? Oh my god they're really going into details :D
---
So they know the people they invite actually play the game and aren‚Äôt just trolls
---
Hey whatever is your idea of fun
---
Just dont watch him. Asmon does his thing and he does it well. Genuinely likeable guy. Pretty sure you never watched his stream anyway, so just keep at it
---
I mean, I think this is the nostalgia speaking xD
---
Some old players are still on the fence about even returning they remember key figures of the community back in the day still questioning if they even want to continue playing.  Why would you want to hype up people who will simply quit after a few hours cause "things are too slow".
---
Focus on the people who want and will make classic great is what I say!
---
I'm not seeing anyone mentioning this but yesterday I was watching Asmongold stream and the Kobold Laborers in the northshire cave were neutral instead of agressive, like it happens on any vanilla private server. I believe they got changed to neutral in wrath
---
Blizzard has something the pservers don't have though. All the old vanilla data together with the client. They can cross-reference with that
---
I think your level 40 one is actually free outright, if memory serves.
---
And your epic one comes bundled with the skill for something like a 400g discount. So yeah, you lucky sausage :) You'll have money to burn on pre-raid BiS BoEs I guess!
---
Exactly. The fact that only Horde can be Shaman makes them feel more tribalistic and closer to earth, wearing armor consisting mostly of leather and furs and rarely metal. While only Alliance can be Paladin makes them feel more "civilized", detached from earth and living behind stone walls, while wearing armor of mostly metal and fine threads.
---
Chuck Norris tanks raids as a shaman
---
The amount of hype is different for every person, you control the level of your own hype and that usually has something to do with how much and what kind of classic content you consume while you wait.
---
Nobody else is responsible for killing your hype.
---
Hi, /u/paniknicke
---
What kills the hype for me are the crybabys that complain about everything once nothing goes as they want.
---
First you wanted a release date and complained about no information about it, now you have it. 
---
Now you  cry because popular streamers get beta access and you don't.
---
What are you going to complain about next once more people get access to the beta?
---
You never needed to eat or drink under level 30 unless you made a mistake
---
Swim speed feels faster than I remember.
---
No one fucking said it's hard you prick
---
Still Vanilla.
---
1. You only need to create a [battle.net](https://battle.net) account and pay $15 a month and you can play Classic WoW, you don't need to pay anything else.
---
2. Totally worth it, better than playing that Retail piece of shit or wasting your time and energy on other inferior MMORPGs.
---
3. You pay one price in order to be able to play both, it's up to you which one you want to play.
---
They were chain pulling packs of 3-4, and he let his hp go super low and then got kicked by a mob he didnt realise had kick so his heal didnt go off.
---
Still though, I'm not sure about the 'difficulty' here.
---
You either pull less and dont risk dieing or you pull more and need to pay attention.
---
It's really not rocket science.
---
Currently his combat is:
---
Sit in bear press maul when it comes up. Swipe on aoe. Exit form -&gt; warstomp -&gt; heal -&gt; go bear again.
---
I normally skip until 40/60, but for Classic I'll be keeping my Engy + Mining leveled with me, so I can throw mad grenades in world pvp.
---
Gathering so I can increase my chances of maybe getting a mount after level 40.
---
Are you in a hurry to get somewhere? This is Vanilla, you don't have to hurry, take your time.
---
~~THATS NOT VANILLA REEEEE~~
---
Listen you entitled shits we want the hardcore dungeons and raids and the community back, not the QOL menu changes. 
---
No bullshit saw people complaining about stuff like this elsewhere in the sub
---
I'm sure he'll get in probably the next batch, but I doubt he has a twitch following and for that reason would unlikely be a top priority. People who know about classic are a lot more likely than random sodapoppin viewers who've never seen the game.

Of course the towllie leech is streaming classic when he was 100% against it.
---
and beta dropped yesterday...
---
Its the FoV, It's still wrong
---
Spicesniffer literally word for word said it's hard, and that's the comment the guy you're replying to was replying to.
---
I know who is the streamer on the image hahaha
---
there was no OCE server during vanilla we played on US servers
---
Oh. My. Gog. People doing things you don't like and giving money to people you don't like. The absolute horror you must feel. Please, come with me to the Safe Space quickly, we have puppies, crayons and cry pillows just for you. I know, people doing things you don't like. You should contact your local politicians and see about getting this behavior banned, nay, criminalized.
---
I played warlock and still had to drink 24/7.. could just wand and use my pet, but instead triple dotted every mob and threw shadowbolts galore lol
---
Just get in the habit of casting drain soul before the mob dies when you are out farming consumables or questing. You will soon look for a macro to auto delete soul shards.
---
Doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay, people shouldn‚Äôt care tbh
---
You do know this is still just a beta after all right? In the summer you'll still gonna get to see Joanna actually speedleveling
---
The website Classicwow.live/live has compiled a list of classic streamers
---
But muh world first
---
Animation and movement looks faster, cause of different ressolution  and modern monitors. There is plenty of videos conparing it
---
‚ÄúHard‚Äù is a relative word. Nothing is hard but something is hardER.
---
Demon/ darks souls were considered hard, yet people still can speed run them.
---
They said each layer will have about as many people as a classic server did, and when the population of a layer dies it gets collapsed into another layer in its group, so you will see about as many people as you would have done in vanilla
---
How absolutely dare these streamers make money off the internet. The temerity, the gall of people to perform a service and MAKE MONEY DOING IT? Gobsmacked with the sheer audacity of it. We should start a hashtag and rally the Twitter mob for some slacktivism against this threat to morality and decency.^/s
---
&gt; Still though, I'm not sure about the 'difficulty' here.
---
Maybe it comes from having to play around abilities you don't know mobs have, like... say a kick?
---
&gt; Sit in bear press maul when it comes up. Swipe on aoe. Exit form -&gt; warstomp -&gt; heal -&gt; go bear again.
---
If you want to put it like that, what game is difficult?
---
If you played vanilla on a private server, you would actually be **less** likely to spot problems in the beta, because you'd be used to all the glitches, bugs  and plain wrong implementations on the private servers.
---
Heyo, all this is covered in the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow) (which really needs updating).
---
&gt; Can I pay for just Classic WoW at a discounted price without paying for a regular WoW subscription?
---
Nope, you have to pay the full regular subscription. 
---
&gt; Is it worth getting into as a new player? Like should I jump into classic WoW or should I get current WoW? I just think I'd like classic WoW more because it's simpler than current WoW.
---
It depends what you like about MMOs. If exploration and the immersive hero's journey are your jam, you should have a great time. If you prefer modern MMOs to older MMOs, you might prefer BfA. The truth of the matter is that 15 years of development has changed the game a lot, Classic isn't a prototype for BfA, it's a very different game with a very different approach. If you don't happen to like BfA don't write off Classic and vice versa. 
---
&gt; Is it worth paying for current WoW just to play classic WoW?
---
For me, yes. I can't tell you what your money is worth to you. There is however certainly adequate content to make your money worth it, as it is the same fee that they charged 15 years ago and that fee was fair then.
---
Hit me straight in the feels, I'm so sorry you lost your brother. Thank you for sharing this, another reminder of what this game has given to so many of us. The friendships and accomplishments you partake in with them is endlessly beneficial to the real world and much as the virtual. thank you Blizzard for reigniting this flame for us!
---
I'm not quite sure you understand most of these streamers. Asmongold has been waiting for classic for a while, and won't quit the beta.
---
People would KILL to play this game again for the first time. 
---
Come on in, the water's fine! Hope you have the best time exploring everything Azeroth has to offer. :)
---
Just consider it a different game, tbh.
---
Everything is different except some familiar NPCs.
---
Awesome, really like this implementation
---
No lmao I played in bc and always had keybinds.... I played dota before that and you had to learn a bunch of keybinds or you were terrible. I was like 14 at the time. Who didn‚Äôt use keybinds?
---
Because money.  To me, it seems like they're betting that even if they only retain a small portion of the people who have never played classic wow before, it's still going to net them more subs than from the players who aren't sure if they're returning or not.  They know they're going to get ample feedback on bugs, etc. with the loyal playerbase that they already have, so now their goal is to widen their reach.
---
I love you :))
---
Look at it logically, there‚Äôs absolutely no reason to give you access over the streamers, it‚Äôs just the reality of $.
---
I wish they made a megathread for memes and other stupid things, not for the only real content on this sub.
---
The most knowledgeable people should honestly get invites. I hate the majority of reddit, and I for sure hate the entire #NOCHANGES REE gang that we have here, but arguing that Joana deserves a beta-key is fair. He should really be top priority.
---
They toned it up again a while back.
---
Is that a realistic example? I thought I heard somewhere that higher ranks are always more Mana efficient not considering overheal.
---
Completely agree that classic is a game that is likely more enjoyable played than watch.
---
But as someone who also fancies himself with a fairly good finger on the pulse of how the gaming market moves, I just cannot see how classic will be anything other than a niche game for a small audience. And what I'm basing that on is empirical evidence - we just aren't playing MMOs to the same extent. At least not as many of us. A lot of people will point to old school Runescape and say that it is indicative of how things will go for classic and the live servers but even Runescape has a very small, but dedicated, niche playerbase.
---
"A tier or two below Fortnite" is wildly optimistic, although we probably have to keep in mind that different people are going to define what a tier or two below Fortnite is differently. I'm fairly convinced that Classic wow will struggle to maintain most of the players that are going to create a character. If a million people make a character on launch, maybe 10-20% of that will actually hit 60 and start doing any end game content. Classic wow is a time investment, a pretty serious one at that. Play classic wow for a week without rushing and you might hit lvl 30 or 40. I remember back in 2005 when I had a week off school, I played for most of that week on a new Gnome Rogue and I hit lvl 36 before I burned out.
---
Blizzard will not abandon their live game and focus on classic, that is a guess Im so sure about that I am willing to bet my house on it. Classic is a loveletter to the fans who want it but I really don't think it is going to be a major mainstream success.
---
But I have been wrong many times before and I will be again. We'll have to see if this time is one of those times.
---
&gt;Maybe it comes from having to play around abilities you don't know mobs have, like... say a kick?
---
I mean, it's very rare. And realistically it just means dont sit to 10% hp before trying to stomp heal.  It's not hard, hes just facerolling and being a chancer.
---
&gt;If you want to put it like that, what game is difficult?
---
I mean, if you asked me if I thought play a class in mythic raiding to the best of its ability on live was difficult for an MMO then I would say yes.
---
Having ONE ability that you press every few seconds however, not so much.
---
Classic levelling / combat etc isn't hard. It doesn't have to be for the game to be good, which it is.
---
what kind of shit is this
---
yeah
---
Idk where you're getting 2 months. They said a few weeks for layering.
---
Chuck Norris actually knows where is Mankrik's wife !
---
Oh aye, course it is. Just a bit of hyperbole
---
I'm having the opposite reaction. Fuck I can't wait.
---
Not a fan of tips whatsoever, on the contrary, I dislike most of his content. But this is just flat out wrong. He was talking about a troll priest and said had he chosen Undead, he could have escaped the sheep via WotF. Now, of course, that's factually wrong, but he didn't mock him. Stick to the facts.
---
Hi, /u/Windrider63
---
Because this is an actual beta, not a demo. They need but reports and feedback to make it as good as possible.
---
Don't gaf what you think
---
" Just because you did it in Classic doesn't make it the "real OG experience." I personally never clicked my abilities and I've played since 2005. "
---
That was my comment and I got attacked by the clicker community.
---
Nah, I'll  be going tailoring/mining and keeping them up to date as I level. I was responding to the guy saying "Not even skinning?" as if it's a no brainer proff for people who are rushing to 60.

Thousands of hours, LEL

do you realize how much of a fuckin nerd you sound like lmao
---
*but muh slippery slope*
---
You need a subscription to access the beta, but your account can be flagged without one.
---
Honestly a druid is the biggest "I want to do everything" class in WoW. 
---
Cat stealth, Moonkin range DPS, bear tank, resto heal.
---
Asmongold
---
/s?
---
It bothers the fuck out of me that a shitter like towellie who no more than 2 years ago was bashing classic proponents got an invite. Fuck that guy.
---
#nochanges
---
I think you're massively over-reacting to what people have said. There is nothing "hard" about pressing buttons to play a computer game. What people have been saying is that Classic will be TOTALLY different from current leveling, in that you have to put in the time and effort. Sure, you can sit there and watch films, listen to music while you level, its not difficult. Maybe the wording is confusing, so harder should mean longer.... 
---
Maybe players who've never played Vanilla wow, will not like how long it takes to level, having to rely on crafted gear or quest rewards, while not having tonnes of heirlooms to twink out low level characters.   
---
Even the fastest speed levelling players will have their challenges with Classic, rather than just have it given to them like in retail!
---
Lmfao.
---
Posts like this crack me up.
---
People who either never played vanilla or who play private servers think they know shit...just SCANNING for problems.
---
This is official blizzard content. Yet dumb shit like this gets posted. ‚ÄúIm watching a streamer and *hyuck* he said it seemed off‚Äù
---
Shroud even got one and apparently so did summit
---
Was it? He seemed pretty insistent on the dev interview a few days ago that it is to get through the launch. But we don't know how long P1 is going to be so it's really up in the air.
---
Nobody knows what their plan is for AQ. They've already confirmed that regardless of how large the population is after phase 1, the layers are merging. With them being willing to do that, why are you already assuming they'll layer AQ release?
---
At this point it really is nothing but fearmongering. Considering what we have to far I would say it is unfair to assume the worst.
---
Don‚Äôt fall for the bait
---
You don‚Äôt understand the persona, do you?
---
I always said it will be released end if august and got downvoted for it.
---
You should be very afraid, Chuck Norris knows you
---
I am a sub for over a year now. I had multiple breaks since vanilla but come back no and then for a few months. I got no beta access. 
---
BUT  
---
I actually hoped to get access but if you think about it...you can play a game as bug tester. Currently, you only can level up to level 30 AND your character will not be transferred after the game is released so you have to start all over again. So do you think the chance of being part of the beta tester is worth 15$?
---
&gt;  And realistically it just means dont sit to 10% hp before trying to stomp heal.
---
Sure, but the list of things you need to play around is huge and remember if you ever hit full hp or mana it means you've made a mistake.
---
&gt; I mean, if you asked me if I thought playing a class in mythic raiding to the best of its ability on live was difficult for an MMO then I would say yes.
---
But that's also just pushing abilities in a certain order, why is that easy in classic but hard in retail?
---
This is somewhat similar to spell schools in EverQuest. You had to train your spells like weapons and it was a BITCH.
---
Because that's fun and you did it right :D
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HviG0miDzaE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=109
---
You didn't need to buy it, but you certainly used it if you were spamming spells
---
is walking for an hour hard? no, it's time consuming
---
Hypothetically, I wonder if it's possible to break layering by having people from the same layer invite people from other layers to your layer, until everyone is on the same layer.
---
Because its BS.
---
It was the same story for Dr Disrespect. Faking to be an asshole still makes act like an asshole towards others and thus you are still an asshole by definition, same goes for Asmongold.
---
Is there a study that shows people getting addicted?
---
TF2 has had crates for years, I haven't heard that it got an entire generation hooked on gambling.
---
I don't think Overwatch is a problem at all. You can't sell skins like you can like Valve games. And you can craft whatever you want for gold. Its nothing like a mobile gacha game.
---
Dont forget the bad ass mounts
---
Willing to share some of those? I got popcorn if you're interested.
---
reported
---
Thank you for sharing and sorry for your loss.
---
WoW vanilla was more than a game back then for many of us, it was a world where everyone gained some great experiences either together with family or new friends.
---
I am lucky to return with the same group of friends i had back then (none of us really liked what WoW have become) and we can't wait to dive into that same familar world of warcraft feeling.
---
Checkmate
---
fuck off
---
People with more experience will have an edge over you to begin with, as is to be expected. However if you put your mind to it, dedicate time to it, there is no reason why you couldn‚Äôt be just as competitive as the rest.
---
Wow, my man, it's almost like that's vanilla in a nutshell.
---
Mining and tailoring takes even more time.... what are you even on about?  
---
Skinning comes naturally as you kill Beasts. If you get Herbalism too, you spot herbs here and there, a lot more often than ore nods.  
---
I've been playing Vanilla on private servers from 2012 until 2019 exclusively and I can tell you that Herb+Skin are the fastest professions for leveling and they bring you money faster than mining as mining takes so much longer to level up.
---
The beta is probably really small. For some reason I got invited into every expansion beta since WOTLK on the day it was launched but not this one. I am not on F&amp;F list or anything, but probably also not just luck since its been very consistent lol. When any of the tests started I just went to the battle net app knowing that it would be there.
---
So either the beta pool is really really small or the conditions for the selection have been changed significantly.
---
That is correct, yes, that was definitely doable in vanilla.
---
They deliberately were vague about all of this in an attempt to trick some desperate people into subscribing.
---
so hard levelling the first levels as a warrior. (probably the hardest class at low levels)
---
Aggro one mob and miss a few hits and probaby dead
---
Aggro two mobs probably means dead
---
Do u guys really think dat a shit streamer like staysafe gonna have an impact on a server pop
---
One of the first things I would do is vendor any of the quest food that I got in vanilla because it would be outdated before I'd ever actually need it.
---
I know they take more time, I'm not in a hurry. I plan to do all dungeons and elite quests, keep my proffs up to date and plenty of PvP. My /played will be 12 days minimum.
---
Did you start your WoW account in 2004/2005?
---
This sub is pro layering, isn‚Äôt that blatantly obvious when reading the threads?
---
&gt;Sure, but the list of things you need to play around is huge and remember if you ever hit full hp or mana it means you've made a mistake.
---
Eh... not really. As I said, you don't even really need to know. People are just dieing because they are trying to go ham and push things quickly. For streamers generally they aren't paying the most attention ever either.
---
&gt;But that's also just pushing abilities in a certain order, why is that easy in classic but hard in retail?
---
If you honestly think that wow retail mythic raiding dpsing is even in the same realm as classic rotations like spam shadowbolt or pres SS into evis while keeping SnD up idk what to say.
---
They arent. And the mechanics are VASTLY more complex.  Classes don't use a simple 3 button rotation either, it's pmuch all priority systems and proc / cd timings etc etc.
---
As I said before, a game doesn't need to be hard or complex to be fun. Classic PVE is not hard, and it isn't complex. But the game is still fun.
---
Proud mushroom here
---
Actually no, stop trying to spread misinformation 
---
https://youtu.be/SwLjJH8LXfc?t=887
---
If you want to get technical about it, the database says 64 to 87, but it gets scaled to the NPCs level using a formula.
---
even tho leeroy was staged it's still better IMO. ony wipe animation is just too much yelling
---
Streaming went from a niche hobby to an actual well paying profession, which means that you're inevitably going to get people who are very clearly in it for the money rather than for the love of it. Don't be surprised to see more of these people pop up as Classic gets closer. Everyone in the streaming industry knows that to get ahead somewhere you need to have something unique or you need to be in on the ground floor so expect a lot of opportunists popping up between now and the release of Classic.
---
Everyone invited to the group gets put on the leaders layer
---
I got a day 1 acc, did not get invited. The acc has not been subbed for the entire duration though, but played every expansion. Current acc status is unsubbed but has gametime
---
Almost puts a tear in my eye. Worst mobs in the entire game.
---
I‚Äôve had my account since like late 2004-early 2005, but I‚Äôve also had pretty large sub gaps since Pandaria. Some even spanning 10 months. Seniority aint everything
---
Look up something like Joana's guide from back in vanilla, it lines up (and yes I know he's a troll). Regen is perfectly fine on beta.
---
It‚Äôs honestly not that hard to learn, especially if you study class guides etc.
---
Damn came here to ask the same :( I would‚Äôve dropped $15 to play the beta if it wasn‚Äôt a chance
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/SwLjJH8LXfc?t=535) is the actual vanilla regen (while sitting) at level 2, I don't have a beta access so I can't test it, but everyone should be using Joana's videos and not pservers when comparing.
---
My stoke-tank was 69% full when they announced classic. Then i got the release date news. I was on my way towards the beach, shouting at youths standing throwing ice-cream sticks into the oceans. I mean, throw them in the forest, that would be better. My phone rang, it was my bro Paul. He said "27 AUGUST", my stoke-tank overflowed into the ocean. I killed local species with my spillage. The police tried to arrested me. I escaped through the shard method of group invite.  I'm sad now that the animals wont be able to experience wow classic, but not sad enough to keep my stoke-tank from full capacity for CLASSIC baby!
---
No thx
---
nope
---
&gt; So do you think the chance of being part of the beta tester is worth 15$?
---
Personally, I think it's off the rocker: Pay 15 bucks a month for a tiiiiny chance at working to find bugs. You know, Q&amp;A is an actual job people usually get paid for.
---
Personally, I'm content to wait for the actual product to hit, set up my sub, and spend that money on actually playing the finished game. but Blizzard is very aware how greedy parts of their player base are for just logging into Classic WoW, and they let that greed work for them.
---
Now that you mention it I can totally see that.
---
Yea but if you can already see the other players, you are already in the same layer. Or am i not understanding the meme correctly
---
Nope, they're fairly committed to just having it be one subscription that gets you both and no one-off boxed cost.
---
Blizzard is a business, they want to make money. Why would they take less money than what people will pay?
---
/s or no /s?
---
Some of these are really silly.
---
&gt;makes the company more in line with Old Blizzard.
---
You mean like Vinvendi?
---
&gt;Shitting on the PC gamer core to switch to mobile gaming.
---
I don't see how making mobile games is shitting on the PC crowd. 
---
Nintendo, Bethesda, EA, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Capcom, and any big game studio are making mobile games. They didn't switch to them. They're making it on top of their core products.
---
&gt; They threw the D3 team under the bus by canceling their work on the second expansion mid way and then slashed their budget into oblivion, effectively ending D3's future saying "Well, they weren't working on anything so why give them a budget?" D3 wasn't great when it came out, but the D3 team actually did turn it into a decent game, it just took a while.
---
According to Kotaku, the 2nd expansion was canceled right before the 1st expansion was released. They didn't throw anyone under the bus.
---
&gt;Blizzard, like every gaming developer has used Crunch as a means of meeting their deadlines, they've said recently that they will avoid the crunch as much as possible but, it seems like a hollow statement.
---
This sounds like an industry problem. I'd have to imagine Blizzard being decent at crunch outside of WoW given how slow their development schedule is.
---
It's gotten way better over the years. Starcraft crunch was probably the worst thing I've read about.
---
Been 14.99 for 15 years
---
Not having the weather effects is a huge disappointment for me. Doesn't feel like vanilla without it.
---
1 sub for both games. No cheaper one
---
Check your "local" webshops. Some shops in Scandinavia had some for sale too.
---
Of course levelling is not hard, it never was. How could it be, if you can just continue where you left off after dying? However, it's still harder than current WoW, where dying while levelling isn't even an option.
---
$15/month in 2004, $15/month now.
---
The true classic experience
---
1 miscellaneous guys moronic opinion is not a shitpost worthy.
---
I tell my friends in discord chat everyone immediately shits on it as a scam to replay old content and I'm just like...  
---
*Yall a bunch of negative toxic mother fuckers, really?*
---
true words. See you at 27th of August (=
---
Mine just says, This account cant be created.
---
GZ! Just a quick question - are you subbed for WoW?
---
So a puzzle is always easy because it only takes time and not skill?
---
Hello darkness, my old friend
---
What is this from?
---
The fuck man it bends
---
f that site
---
Layering is risky but I see the reasoning, I would have been ok with sharding for the first few zones to streamline the burst of players.
---
Same. Not a single beta invite for any blizzard game and sank thousands into subs and many of their games.
---
I know, but I also knew beta was dropping 15/5 and if I were to watch any beta stream I would definitely prefer to watch Joana. As pointed out with his knowledge and previous experience the feedback from him would have real value.
---
No, because they dont want to put a hardline between the player base. They still want people to play Current.
---
The fearmongering has been accurate so far. It hasn't even been released and they've already moved the goalposts multiple times.
---
If they think sharding or layering is the only solution to solve population issues, of course they are going to use it for huge server events. You're being naively optimistic.
---
I dont get why guys like him get invited to the beta.
---
I thought its about Bug reporting and they invite players that havent a clue about classic...
---
&gt;eople are just dieing because they are trying to go ham and push things quickly
---
The mechanics of the game literally punishes not going ham and pushing things quickly.
---
&gt; it's pmuch all priority systems and proc / cd timings etc etc.
---
Which also exist in classic, yet in retail you don't have to account for your ping to do maximum dps, lost autoattacks are pretty much irrelevant, positioning isn't as punishing as literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving.
---
&gt; And the mechanics are VASTLY more complex.
---
But i can write a step by step guide to how to deal with them, which according to you 5 minutes ago makes it easy.
---
On top of that you also get between 5 and 20 times as many pulls per hour giving people a lot more time to get used to the mechanics.
---
You should then focus on the cast animation (hear can be alwes hidden by a hat or smth )
---
Like in PVP Males are better with their low key casting animation with their hands close to the ground (also easier to hide in a bush!)
---
Was it ok for someone who never played WoW to play WoW when it came out?
---
There is your answer. ;)
---
Try checking Joana's speedrun to get a rough idea of the correct damage before jumping to conclusions on mob damage.
---
I think they'll be stronger too just because more people will have gear and more knowledge. However in vanillas life sword was able to proc off of its self and enrage used to be 40 % instead of 25%. And then there's pre weapon normalization for instant attacks. None of that will be a part of 1.12.
---
Dwarf or ud priest

oof, dont math it out on me like that.
---
Hell, if people are a high enough level to kill devilsaurs within the first few weeks, they deserve the gold.
---
Now they do it way waster. It took like a month for Dota Auto Chess to get a separate category from Dota2 and Classic Wow is a bit more popular.
---
I also believe that game publishers play some part in making twitch do ( or not do ) it.
---
Where‚Äôs Billy on launch in layering?
---
Almost everyone I read here is thinking about min/max gold income, speed leveling etc. I miss read more people that will not care about all those things. Everyone should play as they want of course but I think you will be missing the classic journey. 
---
I will be leveling my professions as I level my character, for me it's part of a fullyfilling experience. I feel great when my cooking and fishing skills are up to date so I can buy vendor's food recipes etc. Same with first aid.
---
I also will travel through a lot of starting zones in my journey, I really don't care about time invested. For me it's not "wasted time", for me it's a way to feel connected with your character, invest time in it, get involved with it in different zones and enviroments, walking long distances, compelting all those quests, working through your profession and feeling that your character has an identity around it.
---
I don't mean I will RP or something, I just think getting emotionaly involved with your character makes the journey a lot more fun and satisfactory.
---
I will play an Elf Warrior, so I think I will go Herb/Alch all the way :)
---
Right, but given how many times you will be logging in over the course of hitting 60, the probably of not seeing someone again or even every other day is on the low side. Even with two or three layers. Let's not assume you and Joe Blogs will always be in the same zone at the same time with no layers either.
---
Having nothing in place for the beginning really seems unrealistic. People seem to love the idea of utter chaos but I would bet money after an hour 
---
or two of them doing sweet fuck all the attitude will change. I love a crowd but I would also like to play the game, I'm not aiming to spend half a day trying to reach level 5, you know? (Assuming the servers remain online here)
---
I don't think comparing the entire games sub count during WotLK as a whole to Classic launch individual servers (zones, even) is fair, they are very different things.
---
The realms will be very busy. I'm perhaps not as optimistic about the economic consequences of layers until we hear more, but otherwise it's a compromise. We'll have busy realms and sure not everyone will always be around (in terms of layering) but after phase 1, they will be. Best case scenario, imo, is that layering is collapsed within a few weeks of launch so it doesn't impact things like world raids, but that will of course depend on the servers population. Unless phase 1 is really long, the game won't be too far in. I mean shit we won't even have the honour system yet, we have time.
---
if you install it in a different directory than from your original wow client it's 9 gigs
---
But my National currency was better in 2004 ;&lt;
---
Thats crazy did they act upset when they got flown out by blizzard for the private classic meeting ? Oh wait you werent there LOL
---
We're talking about sending a beta key, no more.
---
All these little changes are taking away from the classic experience tbh.
---
You gonna stop using Amazon too? Apple? Wal-mart? Starbucks?
---
I will sign up on 26th August myself...
---
Looks awesome :D
---
That's because betas nowadays are primary a cheap marketing tool, and so you get a lot of exposure by inviting a persona with lot's of subs.
---
True, but you act like those millions of dollars don't change the picture entirely. Hint, they do.
---
RIP
---
Apart from he's right, loads of people are reporting things even though they have no idea how they're meant to be, this thread is a prime example.

A level 16 warrior getting dazed in the classic beta:
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/UninterestedSarcasticSpaghettiFloof
---
Absolutely fine QOL chances that have no impact on the game in any aspect.
---
That doesn't matter at all. We're talking about people streaming a game on twitch, not the ban policy of Blizzard.
---
Dude, you are not even subbed. You are not eligible for an invite
---
you might be able to just truck through the lvls, but as others has said, there's a lot of downtime in classic where you just run. So if you dont know the route/plan when you'll do which quest an when you'll go back and train, you might get fucked over by spending a lot of time running around. 
---
If that happens, you might want to kill mobs you run past, so you the running isnt complete downtime.
---
Exactly this. If they are that diehard gamers for Classic then they will be rich one way or another anyway.
---
&gt; for the chance at beta
---
You have to be subscribed to get a chance at beta? I got into BfA beta without an active subscription, shouldn't it be the same for Classic?
---
Hello fellow American
---
Hp regen is insane for the warrior, gets hp back to full after 5-10 secs it was nothing like that :D
---
Most over-rated vanilla player ever, you'll see come classic release, he wont be fucking close.
---
I couldn't remember either. I played Paladin in vanilla, and I remember getting it easily without needing to save. Man the years are hard on memories lol.
---
BFA is boring af.
---
Pretty sure its not ‚Äúleaders layer‚Äù but the most underpop of the player‚Äôs layer, so you cant ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù which of the layers you will join
---
How humble of shroud to accept the invite to the beta where even pro players haven't even been invited to play yet. Seriously, fuck this guy and blizzard for inviting him.
---
This is how i learned about Skarm :)
---
And yes he does, a lot a smal videos about in depth Warrior/Druid tank stuff.
---
Twitch chat is the worst thing on the planet and if you don't have  it hidden away then you're doing something wrong.
---
For me it is like eating meat. All those vegans telling me that I should be ashamed for eating meat and it is cruel, unethical, but fuck that.. bacon is delicious
---
So yeah I'm paying for Classic.
---
&gt; implying every scrub edgelord didn't play an undead
---
everyone seems to be enjoying it. loads of bugs though. i‚Äôm so damn jealous.
---
Hi, /u/theboyd1986
---
Where the threads about bugs? I'd like to read them.
---
&gt;The mechanics of the game literally punishes not going ham and pushing things quickly.
---
I don't know why this is such a point of contention for you. Even on live levelling if you pull too much you die. It's a higher number than classic but it's no different. Mobs have abilities there too.
---
&gt;Which also exist in classic, yet in retail you don't have to account for your ping to do maximum dps, lost autoattacks are pretty much irrelevant, positioning isn't as punishing as literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving.
---
I'm sorry, but it's really hard to take you seriously because the things you are mentioning are such non issues, and others are just blatantly not true, like "every class can perform to their max while moving". And players like soda have ~30 ping on classic beta rn. 
---
Classic isn't tuned anywhere even remotely as tightly as mythic wow raids either.
---
&gt;But i can write a step by step guide to how to deal with them, which according to you 5 minutes ago makes it easy.
---
I'm sorry, but you're just making a strawman argument now, and a pretty ridiculous one at that.
---
The latter argument might have a nugget of truth, but it also depends on the bosses and where the hard parts of the fight are etc. 
---
Honestly, I don't think anyone with half a brain thinks classic wow raiding is even remotely as difficult as live. And if you do then I'm sorry, but you've clearly never played live.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/kazzak/krissam/pve/raids
---
This is you, right?
---
Looking at this, you've never even raided mythic. The one time you did the first few bosses (easy ones) I'm guessing it wasn't early in the tier either. But even then, you were sitting there green logging.
---
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/kazzak/krissam?mode=detailed&amp;zone=17#zone=17&amp;difficulty=5
---
So even if you, as you say, can apparently write a step by step guide, and have between 5 and 20 times as many pulls per hour. Apparently you weren't exactly capable yourself. So maybe you're not exactly the best judge *shrug*.
---
Perhaps your idea of what you find difficult if just different to mine. What you find challenging, perhaps I do not.
---
"Perfrom a service"
---
Ok, let's not get carried away now.
---
No, and don't count on it. It doesn't make sense anyway, it is the same price as back in vanilla, no reason to make it cheaper.
---
I'd say, don't look at it as "I want it cheaper because I don't play modern WoW". Instead look at it as "I'm only paying the normal WoW sub like it has always been, but I also get the chance to fuck around in modern WoW if I ever want to try that, for no additional cost!".
---
And *on top* of all that you also get the base game for Classic as well as the base game + all xpacs except BfA for free just by buying that first sub. Honestly, this is the most you ever gotten for the money from Blizzard, and probably any game company.
---
Yes, you can do mouse over macros in Vanilla, but with addons. LunaUnitFrames for example
---
Hi, /u/Dontfrown
---
Levelling difficulty is affected by the class you choose. In classic you actually have to think about how you pull especially on classes without self heals. 
---
Try pulling multiple mobs at low level ‚Äî-&gt; prepare to corpse run...
---
Classic summer implies that you are going to play whole or half of summer at least. Now it comes very end of august when summer has started to end and fall is right in the door. I think this more as classic fall and not summer.
---
There are absolutely weather effects. It was raining in Tirisfal Glades on the pvp server about 3 hours ago.
---
He did say that anyone who subs to him with twitch prime gets a beta key sent to their email, as a joke. Idk how anyone could take that seriously, or anything he says at all tbf.
---
This.
---
that mafia of 10-20 multiboxers will monopolize the whole economy for the next half a year with their 3 weeks worth of freefarm from multiple layers
---
the 99% drop out of pauper casuals (ie most of player base) will be hilarious to watch
---
Launch day issues are the result poor planning.
---
NOTHING MORE.
---
They mistakes just like hardware failure from misgauging your needs is a mistakes.
---
Not a core part of an experience.
---
Because here's the thing. I played in vanilla, and i never experienced that because my server was created to FIX that problem (even though it did create another one down the road because blizzard too many servers in the panic following that intial release).
---
Because they lacked experience and lacked tools to do it.
---
But they don't anymore. You don't repeat an easily avoidable mistake.
---
Nothing from launch day impacts the character of Vanilla because for 90-95% of vanilla players it wasn't a part of their experience. They most dealt with hardware failures and the experimental ideas about class mechanics that sounded good on paper in actual practice were completely broken and worthless.
---
But we aren't getting those either.
---
And we're also not getting a massive ton of extra servers, because blizzard knows that a massive amount those would be abandoned within a few months. And if they have the means to avoid that, then it should be used.
---
Likewise, someone starting a month after release, should have close to the same experience as someone starting on Day 1. Because the content is the same. And they have the tech to make that happen. yes it'll be busy but there's a big difference between simply busy and unplayable due to too many people.
---
There are no dynamic spawns like on PS that they used to compensate for having 500 people in every starter zone. Blizzard is going to have normal rates period. And that would result in a complete day wasted just trying to get through the first 5 levels. You can go and work on professions instead because every is dead as soon as it spawns and you need at least level 5 for most professions. and a lot of profressions are node-capped. Fishing, Cooking and maybe skinning are the only ones you could realistically work on.
---
That isn't even playing the game. That's wasting time and money for absolutely nothing.
---
And WoW isn't pay by time played. It's pay real-time. If they compensate everyone with a free week that is subscribed during the opening period, then by all means, suffer away, the smart people will wait a week and play the game as intended rather paying to log in and do nothing but get annoyed constantly for 3-4 days.
---
I've still got Athene ([Bachir Boumaaza](https://www.facebook.com/Chiren80)) on facebook since the old days (2009?). No he is not in prison as you can see from his most recent photo (29 April) he is chilling with his family (his crazy brother \[the games god\] and his sister) so he is definitely ok don't worry about the leet king.
---
&gt;Does it live up to the hype or is all ‚Äònostalgia‚Äô?
---
Well this is not news - I mean, people have been playing pservers for over a decade. We know the hype is real.
---
As for actual gameplay, Tipsout has a video that is actually pretty good where he mentions all kinds of things he noticed, among them he talks about the general feeling, movement, overall gameplay mechanics, graphics etc.
---
Dude.... Dont play classic then. Jesus Christ go play something else
---
Glad you ended up where you did, not glad you were harassed by interns.
---
Nerd!
---
Yes. 
---
Just so that there are no misconceptions: A level 5 character is able to learn Enchanting, and can then disenchant any item regardless of its level.
---
To be fair. They never said the album releases on the 30th. They just posted the date and people went batshit crazy.
---
Maybe people should stop being so dumb and coming up with retarded ideas?
---
Oh how could he do such a thing /s
---
This done me
---
Absolutely.
---
That part where you forget Shroud is a big fan of WoW.
---
9gb
---
Yes i have never been able to kill any of the horde leaders. I did a few invasions but we didnt have enough players for it or we just sucked. Storming a city again will feel so good
---
I don‚Äôt think you know what the word shady means
---
At least on pservers there‚Äôs the world chat or lfd chat etc so it‚Äôs not that hard to find a group &amp; it‚Äôd very doable while questing. Not sure if classic will have some sort of global chat/channel though? Im guessing they wont
---
I didn't hear that in this particular video. (nor the opposite)  
---
We have plenty of time for answers though, and this seems like a question that will get popular in few weeks and find some consideration &amp; response.
---
Yeah I much prefered being an adventurer to CHAMPION
---
They specifically noted in the announcement that you have to have an active sub to be considered for an invite. Allow me to speak for most everyone else probably just as excited as you who would say that you probably shouldn't give Blizzard your money just for a low chance at an invite. Unless you are certain that you are ok with throwing 15-30 dollars at blizzard just for gamble that you might get to play on a level capped beta.
---
As someone who deleted 30+ alts in vanilla to get his new main further up in the list, I'm immeasurably relieved.
---
Regen values is way off, Asmongold is literally lvling a warrior at lvl 17 without ever eating. You can just kill a mob, AFK while standing for 10 sec and be almost back to full
---
I watched the footage of an SM cath run from that streamer summit and everything looks so good with the high graphics settings. It still looks like classic, just the lighting makes it look notably better. Also the new water.
---
Such an injustice to you and those passionate players.
---
Phew, how edgy you gotta be to come to a sub dedicated to a game just to type some edgy stuff.  
---
&gt;
---
Idk, is that enough edge, or do you need more?
---
*looking at you, Guzu*
---
Jk
---
Thanks for the clarification reddit people! ^_^
---
lol
---
Apes are sick. Love all the content Monkeynews been putting out the last couple of years. Very refreshing instead of all the vanilla bandwagon types like TipsOut etc that don't know shit.
---
Yikes.
---
&gt;  their modern backend (which can not handle large scale player interactions) is the problem and the reason why they introduce sharding.
---
You, sir, are an idiot. Obviously you have absolutely no fucking clue what sharding actually is. You have no clue why retail servers can't handle large scale player interactions. 
---
A shard has a configured scale. A scale that is an estimate for how much interaction is going to be happening and therefore has a set assigned amount of ram and cpu power. Shards - for various reasons - can not be dynamic in scale.
---
However, shards can be configured with much higher power than what we have on retail - that, however, costs more money and that's why blizzard doesn't do this for retail. Since 99% of the time it is not required. This is different in Classic. Ion said so in a recent interview himself, new servers/layers/shards/whatever can theoretically handle more than 1000 players. It's all a matter of configuration.
---
So yeah once again, you are stupid! Don't play classic, please.
---
The classic beta is literally just BFA with a skin.
---
There's literally a dungeon finder and cross realm sharding AND layering. Why aren't people more pissed off about this?
---
No one deserves "top priority".
---
Do they only invite people in US? :/ I live in the Scandinavia.
---
It‚Äôs not hard it‚Äôs just slow.
---
Chuck Norris found Mankriks wife.
---
I would love if they appointed one streamer or horde and alliance and had a draft where they picked other popular streamers.
---
It's a limited beta that's adding more over time, and having a dedicated following or a lot of interest won't guarantee you access. I'm sure there's plenty of people who aren't recognized as an influencer by Blizzard for a variety of different reasons, or influencers that are cut.
---
And to be honest, the beta really isn't that big of a deal. The changes they're making are, at best, QoL and bug fixes on a finished client for a game that was already complete. It's just bug squashing and a PR move at this point.
---
how mad 1-10
---
2005? The were used until like 2009 in EU.
---
gladiator title streamers playing Wow since vanilla keep dying and the game is not hard?
---
Hard != impossible
---
no /s 
---
every pro layering thread gets raised to the skies
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HviG0miDzaE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=109 
---
there is also this video from BC.
---
At this point, you don't even need to buy consumables to lvl, just stay out of combat for 10 sec and you are back to full
---
Hell I'm 28 and my childhood friend still asks me if I want to come over when he gets a new game. One of my best memories is experiencing most of the Metal Gear saga by watching him.
---
9k to 3k at a time is pretty reasonable. Even if 66+% of players don't quit out, people will be trying to maximise time spent in-game early on compared to later. More importantly, they'll be more spread out. The most vital part of layering is that it's going to make the early experience, when *everyone* is low level, bearable. A server can function with 5k+ players on it, if they're not bunched into a handful of zones. Still wouldn't be optimal, but certainly doable.
---
Man, first Game of Thrones last season sucks and now i don‚Äôt get a Classic WoW Beta invite from Blizzard. 
---
What is this world coming to? :(
---
Or just looking by looking at HP. Got into that habit when twinking. Shit that guy has 200 more up than me better gtfo
---
All the Regen meme is a bunch of BS look joana videos from 2004, same regen even if you take in count the 10% Troll racial.  
---
People that played only on Private Server doesnt have really the right to submit "bugs" kek
---
Makes it taste much more delicious when you include the salty tears :)
---
How the fuck does this affect the classic experience? People like you are just too fucking much really
---
do you have over 10 hours a day to play PVP? getting high ranks is not a walk in the park
---
Oh no, how terrible! Someone is making money off of YouTube! SHUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM DOWN!
---
idiot
---
Think that is the wrong link mate.
---
There is a rogue on private servers right now who literally spends 6 hours a day camping outside RFD to kill alliance.
---
Everyday.
---
Only takes one to ruin it for everyone. And my answer to your next question is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if there are solutions involving the mercy of other people, I just don‚Äôt want to have to deal with it. Why does it bother you that people don‚Äôt want to be on PVE servers‚Äù.
---
Looking up my stats huh, I must admit i find it strange that you didn't go to rio where you would clearly see that character is an alt, but again, if you did that it would be a lot harder to shit on me for it, so I must admit I'm kinda wondering if you didn't do that on purpose.
---
&gt; and others are just blatantly not true, like "every class can perform to their max while moving"
---
Name 1 class that can't.
---
&gt; I'm sorry, but you're just making a strawman argument now
---
That was literally your argument, which means it's by definition not a strawman.
---
/s btw
---
That makes it 2 of us :)
---
That link is from retail BC, and I was just referencing his live stream and you can see the difference.
---
Tbh classic beta is one heck of a money boost for twitch i guess. I‚Äòm almost in my 30‚Äòs and I never watched a stream before because the targeted audience wasn‚Äòt in my age (at least I thought that). Now with classic beta I decided to give it a chance and I think many older players do the sam
---
You need a hug
---
I think that‚Äôs a valid point, maybe all the people who got invited right away were still currently subbed? I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs any way to confirm if that‚Äôs true, 
---
Considering you need an active sub to sign up for the beta, maybe that‚Äôs the case here too. I would consider it a little bonus for staying with and supporting blizzard still
---
If they use that level advantage to turn around and gank lowbies, yeah. Ganking is a pretty no lifer thing to do.
---
&gt;in that you have to put in the time and effort
---
Retail does not require effort, just charge in and kill every mob in the area without effort
---
Classic requires planning, pulling carefully otherwise die, it is harder
---
Classic is not impossible, it is not very very hard
---
but it is hard
---
No, nearly every starting zone have X type of mob neutral and 1 aggressive.  
---
Human have Wolf Kobold1 Kobold2 and Defias   
---
Elf have Tiger Boar Greel and Spiders
---
&gt;Can I be competitive at all in WoW classic if I've never played WoW? Do people that have played it for 10+ years always have an edge over me
---
Well, the answer is a bit different depending on PvE or PvP.
---
First, PvE. Many classes like mage or warlock basically just use *one* spell in their rotation. Some have a little extra to do like rogues or hunters, but in general it is not hard to learn how to do your rotation. What mostly determine how much dps you do is your gear and consumables. Gear you will get from just playing. Find a guild, be active in raids. The consumables is just a matter of farming x amount of gold each week to buy them with, or farm mats and make it yourself. Of course there are a little extra to a PvE fight, but it is really simple compared to many modern MMORPG games, so read a guide on a raid before hand and you will learn it in no time. Read a guide on your class and you learn it in no time.
---
Then there is PvP. Here it will show you are new. First of all, you need to learn your class well. Know not just all your spells and abilities, but also the tricks you can do. There are also many consumables and special items that are used a a lot (for example a stun grenade), but you can read a PvP guide for this.
---
The probably biggest factor will be your lack of knowledge of all the classes. You can't really fight other classes without know all their spells and abilities, so you need to learn how all classes work. This also means you need to learn all their little niche tricks they can do, just like you needed to learn tricks your own class can do.
---
Now, you can obviously read guides on other classes, but personally I found the absolute biggest help I ever got in PvP was playing other classes. You first truly understand a class once you played it, and that's also when you really learn their weaknesses. The problem is, you can't just level all classes to 60 - it takes too long time. So people that played for a long time will always have this above you, many people have played all classes for years.
---
Of course, fear not! This does not mean you are doomed, not all people have played all classes. And you can still learn to fight them, but "veterans" *will* have a great feeling for fighting all classes that you will have a harder time learning. Just know that you need to put in the time to read guides and watch youtube guides and gameplay of all the classes.
---
&gt;always have an edge over me, even like one year down the line?
---
So to conclude, that very much depend on you. In PvE, not at all. In PvP? depends on how much time you spend really looking into other classes and learning PvP tricks and all that. The biggest part of PvP is knowledge and then of course the practice it takes to apply this in the heat of a battle. If you are serious about learning you will still be able to become better than the majority.
---
&gt; Unless you are certain that you are ok with throwing 15-30 dollars at blizzard just for gamble that you might get to play on a level capped beta.
---
I'm not, fuck this then.
---
I know. I shouldnt complain just because someone farms money on shitty content. I've just blocked him from showing up in my feed.
---
Still does not change the fact that his videos are garbage and that he really should not be as big as he is
---
Reporting you bcs you wrote "ctfu" to someone who said "good for you".
---
Oh you think that? Do you?
---
https://i.4cdn.org/vg/1557985481624.webm
---
Did you mean to reply to me?  If so, I don't understand your point in context.
---
Druid bros unite! Teleport moonglade is gonna make things so much quicker.
---
Because it's a lie.
---
I'm almost 40 and I I'm not watching it.
---
Then no one should get a beta-invite. Lets just skip the beta and wait for release.
---
What's monitors are those?
---
AcTiVisIon Is iN iT fOr THe MoNeY 
---
No shit.
---
Assuming we bought a subscription just to play a beta.
---
Or even that people who are subbed  even got it
---
That‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôs aid.
---
DS isn't even hard it's literally just a test of patience and how well you can pavlovian yourself into dodge-rolling a boss at the right moment.
---
Beautiful environment and world building, terrible game mechanics imo
---
Blizzard stated that the beta was to ensure that this are "as they were", so the fact that there are multiple people who were passed over that had documented first hand experience, and some who even helped optimize the leveling process, while many "fans" of the game that have large followings have gotten in is a complete contradiction.  He might be a big fan, but he isn't a WoW streamer or content creator.  He just has one of the biggest following on Twitch.
---
Lets call a spade a spade.  This first wave was all about marketing.
---
Has there been any OCE keys gone out ?
---
Skinning only no cocking, fishing or first aid.
---
I dont really know what to do with a 240p quality video not even taking in count that a human have more spirit hence regen and not having a breakdown of it.
---
Usually people that unironically call other people a nerd are in the single-digit IQ spectrum. 
---
Your colleagues are trying to boost their own egos to compensate for the lack an ability to think on their own. Are they in sales?
---
Will you not take up first aid at 60 at least?
---
&gt;No, but people somehow think they remember all the details from over a decade ago and their memory can't possibly be wrong and of course pservers with guesswork have not coloured their memory at all.
---
Can people explain why people who are saying that regen is off are getting downvoted? Asmongold is lvl 17 and regens to full almost instantly after combat. I have literally not seen him eat food once, ONCE. Are you really gonna tell me this is how it was in vanilla?
---
Layering is bad because its a change, and detrimental to how the game was supposed to be played back in the day
---
That being said, I truly thing that youre whining about a non-issue. Not only isnt this nearly as bad as you portray it, but you also have to take into account that reddit is an absolute shitshow, and that youve got people from r/wow (who has no business playing classic wow, considering what they want from it) "brigading" this sub and belittling the general classic community
---
Id also like to mention that youe standard is incredibly low when it comes to "toxicity"; negative emotions, just like all other emotions, are valid to have. You really strike me as a "we're all about the positivity!!" person after reading this, which i find a dumb opinion to have. 
---
Why do you feel the need to complain about this anyway? I personally find this shallow as all hell, and i truly do think you divide "the community" even further with a post like this. Did you think it through?
---
&gt;Listen you entitled shits
---
Dude, literally, wait... Yes, *literally* only one person said they didn't like it in this thread. And looking at his comment history he is either a troll or borderline retarded.
---
if there are more ethical alternatives ....
---
incorrect.
---
You said why waste time, he said it‚Äôs only sending a beta key.  I think the answer is clear. 
---
I agree with you that pulling people from other games is probably going to bring in more people.  However, I know quite a few people who play retail that are quite hesitant towards classic, so it is not for nothing. 
---
Plus it would be valuable feedback non the less which is what they pretend to listen to when developing, so they should also pretend to send the invites to the eight people to get said feedback.  It only makes sense.
---
He is lv 17 lmao, people forget that below 40 the regen was quite high.  
---
PS made more dmg to this reddit than anything sigh
---
I mean sure, but how can we trust the memory of people who played 15 years ago ?
---
incredible story. definitely "WoW" is not just a game. we'll see you in classic azeroth
---
The new cinematic (retail WoW), called "Safe Haven".
---
Vanilla in a vacuum is a fairly easy game, even leveling.
---
Vanilla leveling compared to retail and 90% of all other current MMOs, it's very hard.
---
I wonder just how many people here are usually on the private servers sub. Would explain the amount of salt here sometimes, since that sub is 99% negativity.
---
Official Blizzard BfA cinematic released yesterday - ["Safe Haven"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umAgdVTBae0).
---
Likely not; lookingforgroup was city-only during vanilla.
---
Hahaha QQ ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
---
Yeah, it is kind of backwards. Only way I'm justifying it is by farming tokens for playtime.
---
Maybe I just knew crap Druids or was a crap Druid myself but I never seen anything except a warrior tank in vanilla, not a prot pala, not a feral Druid, just warrior. 
---
Have they changed threat for classic?
---
That Shadlol guy is just trolling
---
Did the client just update and show the option of Beta? Did you need to relog the client or restart it?
---
"quite high" he is literally not eating ever, not even once. Its off.
---
Regarding priest versus paladin:
---
I watched a vid by Preacher that said mana for healing priests was a massive problem, which would force you to more often than not, have to wait between heals for the 5 second rule or they would go oom VERY quickly.  Is this accurate?
---
I much prefer chain casting...doing something ALL the time.  Would paladin suit this playstyle better and would priest just frustrate me in the end?
---
I mean, he has had more viewers than Tips all night.  And not by a small margin either.  As of posting, he has double tip's viewer count.
---
What about being able to melee people 10 yards away thru walls and backstabbing while facing away from your target? It‚Äôs official blizzard content!
---
While I can't stay entertained from retail anymore and I think the story is pretty bad in many aspects, I can't deny the amazing cinematics they make. BfA really nailed cinematics. The BfA trailer was just amazing, one of my favourite so far and all of these cinematics throughout the xpac are great. Even the in-game graphics cutscenes are cool and so was the Warbringers.
---
Whatever quality reports Joanna can give will not change depending on whether they get in now or a bit later.
---
I feel like I'm top priority, but I'm not sitting with any beta key.
---
I love how the community no longer gives a shit about #NoChanges
---
DoA
---
This is just no true. Retails &amp; Privates proved it already, every time they made some phasing in whatever way it got abused. 
---
Dramatic ? Just tell me how layering is not touching core rules of the game ? Sure it is super elegant and some cool piece of technology, that is not the point.
---
who are you to determine how big he is lol. Just because YOU dont like his content means that he should have literally zero subscribers and get zero views? Come on man. There are lots of people who enjoy his content, who are you to say that they shouldnt be? 
---
I personally love his content and dont see at all what you mean by it being garbage.
---
&gt;Looking up my stats huh, I must admit i find it strange that you didn't go to rio where you would clearly see that character is an alt, 
---
Honestly, I didn't even bother to check rio because I was thinking of raiding. And your chars arent linked on wowprogress.
---
Checking your main now, honestly, it isn't much different. You're raiding 3 days a week and &gt;world 2000 rank. At that point you're just waiting on gear to let you faceroll content via over gearing it because playing is too hard.
---
You haven't actually killed a single end boss on mythic in a raid since AT LEAST cataclysm.
---
Asmongold died a fuckton already and said managing Defias mobs in Westfall is harder than managing a mythic+. It‚Äôs tough. Not Dark Souls hard, but definitely not the faceroll that is BfA.
---
Day 1 account. Got my invite sometime after midnight‚Äîwell at least that‚Äôs when I checked my launcher. 
---
Just looked at the email, sent 9:45pm central US.
---
He reported a bug in the first 5 min tho! Haha. He did okay classic tho. Not sure to what extent. Shroud is the man
---
You act as if Towellie even bashing Vanilla all the time wouldn't switch to playing Classic for the $$$ and viewers
---
From what i understand is that druids can tank dungeons pretty good and can offtank in raids. Warrior and Feral tanks were kinda equal in dungeons but warrior was better raids. Then again, i dont have any experience but thats what i see most people saying on reddit.
---
Well, the game has already been playable for years for free. Classic is pservers with slightly different values, better scripting and polish for nonraid content and subscription cost. Outside subscription cost, those differences have zero impact on the big picture.
---
If we consider the subscription cost it will have negative effect (duh), it's completely outrageous for casuals and the game slows down significantly once you're 60 and got your prebis, then you need to roll alts to have stuff to play. All my friends quit a few weeks after hitting 60, and it wasn't because some trash mobs were not linked in Maraudon.
---
Does the uploaded one loop better?
---
May just be reddit previews but it cuts pretty badly.
---
Either way it looks great
---
what is that cc timer addon? Looks nice
---
They will see a lot of queues like some servers did in vanilla.
---
I used to get offended being called a nerd or a geek. Then I thought to myself that being a nerd is cool. Never once have I denied being one or walked away from a conversation. If I love video games, comic books, sci-fi and fantasy, it doesn't mean that it defines me. I'm a human being with hobbies and I love what I do. I'm passionate about it. 
---
I still get the weird looks when I admit reading comic books or playing WoW or Star Wars. But that's just makes me sad for them. They don't get to enjoy all the stuff I do, because society defined it as "not cool" or "nerdy" or "childish". And they miss out on some great stuff.
---
I will never tell anyone it's stupid to watch this tv show or that it's childish if you like vampires or something like that. If you love stuff, good for you. I'm glad you're happy.
---
I swore to myself to never reject anything because society wants me to or expects it. I will love and like all the stuff I want and nobody will change my mind. 
---
So, OP, If you love WoW then I'm glad to have one more person to share this game with.
---
I've had a sub for basically 12 straight years, and played and given feed-back on every single beta WoW has had, but I dont think I "deserve" a beta or should be any kind of priority at all. So no, you are most likely not even close to top priority.
---
Joana should get a key asap though
---
Living costs are also 60% lower than for example Belgium.
---
i understand your struggle
---
like you, when purchasing stuff, I often research companies and buy more expensive stuff from companies that I believe have better ethical values and improve the society 
---
Recently I was reading about how happy Guild Wars's employees are, I started playing that game again and having lots of fun
---
Haha yep! Good guess.
---
Warrior's probably hardest to level all the way to max. You get to live the sweet life once you're there, though.
---
If you can't affod $15 a month man you have bigger problems in your life than playing WoW.
---
‚ÄúI want this so blizzard will have to listen to ME‚Äù
---
Because people like this one below that post a 2008 video from pserver, thinks that a buggy trashpile like a PS is the 100% authentic vanilla experience.  
---
While if you had the time to look joana video from 2004 you can clearly see that REGEN seems higher at low levels  
---
also a lot of people here are so dumb to link staysafe video while he has demon armor up that gives 3regen5 or human video \[cough racial spirit increase\]
---
Well, if you haven't played the game for almost 6 years then how do you know you won't like it? The beauty of having both versions on the same sub is that you can play both. Imo vanilla excels in some areas and BFA excels in other areas, they are practically two different games now. For instance if you like difficult group and raid content then BFA is much better, and if you like community, RPG and a sense of belonging in a "world" then vanilla is better. Doesn't mean you can't play both. I will raid in BFA while playing vanilla. One of the nice things about BFA is that you can narrow it down to one specific area, so I can pretty much only do raids, now we only have one raid day and it's a nice break from vanilla. Even better is that you don't have to grind consumables in BFA because you can just buy them with tokens.
---
So I advise at least giving it a try.
---
Yeah, this is gonna be fixed.
---
Here here!! üç∫üç∫
---
&gt;Retail cannot handle 40v40 because ram and cpu is too expensive
---
Holy fuck you are actually retarded
---
I maybe just remember things differently but in my experience anything other than warrior was just not viable and the first non warrior tank I ever seen was a prot pala in tbc. I do remember having one balance Druid in our raid team and he was made fun of constantly for his spec/dps but brought along because he was a good lad and we very rarely had 40 people anyway lol
---
Druids are arguably the best tanks for 5 man dungeons and UBRS. Their utility is unmatched, and their TPS (threat per second aka ability to hold aggro) and DPS is way higher than a warriors as well as having ridiculous damage mitigation. They even have a place in raids because of their threat generation, especially for Horde since they lack Paladin's blessing of salvation
---
You certainly will!
---
Well, once the initial beta rush is over I'd assume addon developers will start looking into making them. You also have to remember many addons are not that useful before level 60. Sure it is fun to have a damage meter at low levels, but it isn't that essential. This means they have an extra few months even after launch to develop and fix bugs in their addons.
---
If addons are similar to develop as in modern WoW it is not going to be a big problem.
---
d\*cks out
---
Will WoW classic be a separate client?? Or just he beta.
---
Above you play button is a drop down menu, the beta appear in there under in development
---
Same here. I never was able to successfully down one. I‚Äôm pumped for this and try and nab some faction glory
---
My co-workers call me gaming geek and I say yep and proud of it. I am stoked for August 27!!
---
To be honest it is worded in a way that does not imply you need sub for invite, but for playing.
---
Have they said previously there would be no layering/sharding technology implemented at all?
---
Why do you believe they think it is the only solution to large scale events? Why are you assuming those are problems in classic, that require a solution? The reason events lag out with higher number of players today in retail is not simply due to the number of bodies. Bodies themselves are less of an issue in classic due to what's going on behind the scenes of the game coupled with improved technology. Not to suggest, of course, that we won't be lagging at the gates of AQ.
---
Layering is a compromise to achieve a bustling but smoother launch with the longer term server health/continuity. Launch with fewer, more concentrated servers that are layered, so they can be collapsed after launch once the population spreads out and begins to stabilise. They've committed to collapsing them after launch, because the purpose for layering is the launch. You are as much pessimistic as I am optimistic. 
---
Battles outside AQ are a different ballgame to trying to quest 1-20 with the same level (for arguments sake) of crowd. If you haven't watched the dev interview from the media event I suggest it.
---
It would get buried solely because the big twitch streamers who don't play WoW regularly would jump on the hype train to get the viewers and subs. As soon as they lose subs they will stop streaming it, just as it always has been with the best example being Sodapoppin.
---
There are still plenty of people who have interest in watching retail and there are plenty established WoW streamers who have no interest (as of right now) to play Classic all the time. There will definitely be more viewers watching Classic streams for the first few months, especially until BFA gets out of the hole it dug itself, but even that will eventually even out as soon as the bigger FotM streamers stop streaming it.
---
Looks great! The "lightning" surges looks a bit out of place though, he should just be burning all around :)
---
Off based on what? A private server? Instead of making the 'this seems off' show some 2006 proof. Myself, the tickrate for regen seems high and if I get invited I'll fully deep dive into old vids and archives to prove it instead of making reddit threads and false bug reports based on foggy knowledge and private servers
---
Yes. Hundreds of thousands of people are clamoring to play WoW Classic and Blizzard will reduce the cost for reasons. ;)
---
Easy to miss but Perp found it in an hour? Along with other things? I appreciate someone like him on the Beta doing this legwork rather than just another leveling stream. He‚Äôs putting his beta access to use for the good of the game.
---
hey at least all the private server streamers got a invite who report zero bugs.
---
&gt; ou haven't actually killed a single end boss on mythic in a raid since AT LEAST cataclysm.
---
Except you know, I have, but lets ignore that
---
&gt;  At that point you're just waiting on gear to let you faceroll content via over gearing it because playing is too hard.
---
But if retail raiding is hard, how can you just wait for gear and faceroll? I'm sorry, that seems to be mutually exclusive to me.
---
Also, I would love for you to answer my question, which class can't move and perform optimally at the same time?
---
you got downvoted because you replied all serious like to a joke comment, made you come off as a bit of an asshole.
---
My bad i guess food was used for something in this game. I guess you dont need it then.
---
I honestly couldn't care less. Just don't open their streams and how does it affect you then? Then the only effect on you will be the game might be a little bit more polished / less bugs once it release and you get to play it.
---
Bring it on!!
---
Yes because they have their own currency. But blizzard doesnt have regional prices and they have to pay in euros, thats the problem. It would be fine if they could be a price that made sense for that region in their own currency but they cant
---
They really fucked up with the Beta-Invites, especially by not inviting me.
---
or not... lmao... i've been playing since vanilla, and never ever got a beta invitation lol.
---
i had to login to crack a wow token lol
---
man the interface is really different now
---
its wierd how they changed everything
---
it was also funny to like crack a token then instantly log out
---
Thanks! So it just appears when my account is "tagged"? I do not need to refresh or anything?
---
Since when is it bad to be called a nerd? 
---
BTW be careful with those rose-tinted goggles. You might have loved the game 15 years ago, but that was 15 years ago. Just don't keep your expectations too high :)
---
You can't transport into another server, you can just transport into another "layer" by asking your friend who is in a different one to invite you to a group.
---
Is this wallpaper optimized for 3440x1440?
---
Hi, /u/haniz27
---
That's Asmongold. And he doesn't do actual relevant content because he gets motivated solely by loot and not by the actual content.
---
Almost every other WoW streamer either runs raids, M+ or Arenas primarily.
---
Benediction/Anethema
---
Well...the problem is......High Elves are ally in Vanilla. Like all of them, except for like 6.
---
They didn't technically convert until after the portal opened and Kael's reps came back to explain everything that had happened. Since the High Elves had essentially branded the handful of blood elves as traitors due to the reports coming in from Dalaran.
---
it was only after the dark portal reopened that they split up, and let's be honest, that had nothing to do with loyalty to kaelthas or their allies in the alliance, they just wanted that sweet Muru-Cocaine, which caused a large amount of the race say screw this and go home.
---
if Horde gets any race, it needs to be Ogres, as god intended, and have rexxar finally take his rightful place as a true horde leader.
---
just make Paper bag vender, that when equipped in your head slot give you a buff that says "You're extremely pretty now".
---
Dude. The hard side of retail is soooooooo much harder than classic. 
---
I love both, but accusing retail of easy gameplay is just you not looking for it: I  was in mythic bod on 8.1.5 and Tirisfal Glades on 1.13 tonight. One was much more difficult than the other. Both were fun.
---
I always thought it stemmed from being on sweaty streamers nuts.
---
I just play D3 this Weekend. Fuck Classic :p
---
I've checked up on some vanilla footage, and the classic beta doesn't get it entirely right (I personally played mainly on a PvE server, so my memory isn't reliable in this regard).
---
It seems like they either play on a PvE server, or that the PvE standard of zone-text coloring is what they're using here.
---
Someone should do an analysis. It shows your miss/dodge/parry chance right? Farm some same level mobs, do some math, figure that shit out.
---
Pretty sure you'll eventually end up on layer 2 instead. Or move a guild with 100 members from layer 1 to layer 2.
---
Hmm, when i try and use the link in WPE doesn't seem to work.
---
Because TBC is trash when it comes to everything besides HC dungeons and raids.
---
Outland is the worst continent in the game (because of its tiny size), extreme faction imbalance, the nerf to all pre-60 content, portals everywhere, flying and dailies begin.
---
TBC is still playable, but it feels a whole lot smaller than vanilla, and there is absolutely no reason to ever play Alliance in that expansion
---
This is why i play on PvE.
---
You can just stand outside Goldshire as a Horde and /hug Human Paladins as a Undead DK.
---
After a few days the Paladin starts recognizing you. :)
---
Worked much better before Real ID too. Ah well.
---
Cat is the only thing that has anything close to a "rotation" and even then it's debatable (protip, don't go feral for pvp).    For PVE healing, Downrank, downrank, downrank!  Druids can pump heals, but they are huge mana hogs and being able to effectively downrank your spells to get the maximum efficiency from them will take you far.  Also if you plan on raiding healing, figure out if you will be tank or raid healing, asa those are two different specs with two different playstyles and ability usages.
---
For PVP, get used to shifting in and out of your various forms as the situations calls for it.  Being able to swap forms and use their special abilities in conjunction with each other at the right times will make or break you as a druid.  Druids don't really have any hard counters when it comes to PVP, as it all comes down to skill.
---
As for Professions, anythign works really.  Nothing a druid needs comes from craftable gear, so you got that going for you.  Alchemy is great if you can get your hands on flask recipes, and Engineering is, of course, must-have if you plan on PVPing a lot.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I'm hoping they'll send a few more invites out in waves like normal? Just smaller waves.
---
I so much rather had more Servers and later getting merges than this garbage. I'm mostly angry that people can abuse that system and switch layers to farm/level more quickly. Especially the fucking Streamers will abuse that to hell and back again.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs only 3 days total beta time?
---
Thats not ruining the game, its just inefficient way to do the launch.
---
&gt; couple retail streamers 
---
probably only watched Asmongold who has been saying those things ironically his whole stream.
---
It's a new strategy. 1) it is very cheap marketing. And 2) It's almost "collective testing" ... the interactive nature of streaming is unlike anything you could have done in 2004. We already see streamers making lists of things to test and then there are THOUSANDS of people watching (/guiding/instructing) for bugs. It's not perfect, thus eventually adding more players and then the stress tests, but it's kind of neat.
---
When you are above 20, this isnt a private server
---
I did some leveling tests, 1-40 to see how long it'd take me both /played and how often IRL I could keep attention. I did face stab grinding humanoids and here's the results:
---
https://i.imgur.com/8Q5SxwL.jpg
---
I did the same test trying to quest as much as possible as combat swords and got better results, but it took me more IRL days since my attention wasn't held as strongly.
---
https://i.imgur.com/quCYAG4.jpg
---
I prefer going a dagger spec just so I can murder any reds I come across more efficiently. Though combat does come out on top VS mages.
---
Not that I've heard. Only NA people have reported access so far.
---
No IRL either in Europe got in either yet
---
tips also says that he is a Iron Maiden and Beatles fan lol. He's born in the 90's hence cant be a REAL Maiden fan like me, i had all their LPs. 
---
Tips if you read this. I only watch a handfull, but GJ on the content and the networking that you do. Getting interviews with key people and guide colabs with experienced players.
---
&gt;Our memory may be skewed. But this is definitely not 100% accurate.
---
That is a bit of a paradox, isn't it? You say your memory might be wrong, but you still know for sure that it is not accurate.
---
Honestly, it has been *12 years* since vanilla. Either you rely on 12 year old memories or you played pservers which will have changed your memory.
---
Just look at the warlock thing, so many people were reporting in in the demo. Everyone was so sure that they were right, but Blizzard found the *actual* data of it and proved them all wrong. Why should your memory be special?
---
Is the beta free for all?
---
Damm that sucks, thanks for the reply though :)
---
I think it's just that you set false hopes for yourself to get in, even with a sub.
---
No, the beta will last months.  There will be three separate times in which a lot more players will get temporary access in order to stress test the servers and stuff.
---
You can't find the mana bar and see how it fills up on a 240P video? Okay keep playing dumb.
---
i feel like people are missing something huge
---
layers are 3k people per continent.  that effectively makes it a 6k pop server.  that's huge, and i don't imagine it will ever be an issue where you go into a 2nd layer, apart from at launch.
---
some percentage of players are going to be inside raids and dungeons and therefore not counted towards the total so you'd probably need like 6500-7k players to break into a second layer
---
I can find several videos and posts about how Classic is "more casual" than retail. Certain things are harder but the game itself is not hard. One of Blizzard's original design philosophies was "make the player feel OP" ... this was in the world of everquest dominating the scene. It was EASY.
---
It's just way slower and way less forgiving. And one of the reasons it's slower is because it's less forgiving.
---
&gt; Except you know, I have, but lets ignore that
---
ok, link the logs? Since armory is saying you havent:
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/kazzak/krssam/pve/raids
---
&gt;But if retail raiding is hard, how can you just wait for gear and faceroll? I'm sorry, that seems to be mutually exclusive to me.
---
Gear = stats = stronger. This trivialises mechanics that would otherwise 1 shot you etc. It also means you can survive things such as failing a bomb on mekka etc etc. Furthermore it means that things that were tuned around times (they generally are) are either no longer an issue or entire mechanics get skipped simply by being faster leading to the mechanic never even happening because you now over gear it.
---
Furthermore, when you're scraping that low in the barrel you're also doing everything post multiple nerfs generally.
---
For example, the latest round of Jaina nerfs make her a complete joke. So killing her now for the first time wouldn't be comparable at all.
---
&gt;Also, I would love for you to answer my question, which class can't move and perform optimally at the same time?
---
Essentially every class in the game that has any kind of a cast time on an an ability that requires you to stand still? 
---
Let me use an example: A MW monk.
---
A MW monk has (outside of EF) and renewing mists (which is just keep on CD so its on the raid) zero core healing abilities that can be cast while moving.
---
You want to heal with vivify? You aren't moving.
---
Yawn. 
---
Blizzard makes games I like, games I love, and most importantly games I can afford. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about much else. That‚Äôs why I live in a society of laws, I get to defer that angst and anger to calm and collected and reasonable attorneys who work within a legal system we all abide by and vote upon‚Äînot your personal ethical code.
---
my dad works at blizzard :)
---
Thank you for the valid input.
---
Well it's beta, so not indicative of the final game. I'm actually impressed that Blizzard does a real beta where people test stuff out and provide feedback instead of just showing off a finished game a few months before release like most companies with "early-access" do. Of course it's a bit ridiculous that a bunch of streamers got keys. I want to believe that Blizzard tries to show the beta content to more people so there are more eyes on potential bugs, but I find that hard to believe.
---
yikes
---
Fear the Defias Pillager man.
---
Asmongold? This is the same guy that basically would be on WoW streaming it each time for hours on end doing transmog contests and mount runs on retail. He will be fine and keep playing classic beta till it comes out and plays that. He always finds some type of entertaining to do and WoW is the only thing he knows and loves.
---
Edgelords want everyone to walk everywhere so they can bank noobs duh.
---
But seriously flying made the world seem way more empty. I think even blizzard developers ackowledged this as a problem. The portals in shat already made it easy to travel and if anything they should have just made flight paths fly more quickly.
---
Frost who's been streaming vanilla/tbc for like 4 years, poongoon the same. Kargoz who's guides are the best on youtube and he has streamed nearly everyday for like 18 months just talking about classic. None of them get an invite.
---
Meanwhile you have cata babys that farm transmog and have shit talked classic for years PLAYING THE BETA RIGHT NOW.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I see now.  Thanks for clarification!
---
The time they'd be wasting in this scenario is if they only have a limited amount of keys that they're willing to send out right now, they'd have to be more discerning with who to send to in order to maximize advertising to the demographic they're focusing on.  So if they're not focusing on people already invested in classic, they would essentially be inefficiently using resources by sending to Joana.  So they set aside a small portion for non-influencers to show goodwill to the playerbase, as if to say "stay hyped, this could be you!" and then save the rest for marketing.
---
    
---
I'm not saying that there is zero value in sending a key to Joana or other classic content creators, just that it seems like Blizzard has different priorities atm.  I would honestly be surprised if Joana didn't get in relatively soon, but I can understand why not immediately.  
---
It's also possible that Joana slipped through the cracks somehow and someone at Blizzard will see this tomorrow and go "oh shit, that's right" and he'll get invited soon.
---
Well the way some people seem to be playing the beta I won‚Äôt be surprised when they get burned out big time.
---
Yay not only has this ended up happening but we get to reserve 3 character names! Super happy about this :D
---
&gt; I know it‚Äôs going to be crazy busy the first few days anyway, but isn‚Äôt that kind of the fun and excitement of a launch?
---
Ofc it is. Its fun, but can be frustrating for people that are trying to rush to 60 ( have done levelup multiple times in private servers and have enjoyed the "journey" enough ). 
---
And if its anything like private server launches, every damn mob location spawn point was camped by 10+ ppl. And if you are L1, going after those L5's in the side (if you are lucky enough to connect at start and try to avoid where others go) might be too much, even for few ppl. And party XP isnt really great in grinding (as those quests are followups to the first quests, you are only lookin at killing xp).
---
Luckily just plowing through works, when you get into the 10+ level range you can actually find mobs to kill. Because the map area is so much bigger. Quest mobs are going to be hard to tag, still.
---
im not reading all that but i watched a few streams there is like no one even playing and like 2 people per zone
---
i dont even really care about the beta if there is no one to play with
---
I've played my Druid in vanilla. I've played as Feral for leveling. After reaching level 60 I needed 4 friends to farm actual heal gear. Heal gear was most of the time cloth at first until you got the gear you needed.
---
You will not play every role as a druid. You will only heal. And you will only be good as a raid healer. Everything else is just a waste of time. As a druid you can do everything but nothing pretty good. And you have to pay gold if you want to respec. To respec you have to move to a specific location. (I actually do not remember correctly when you learn the port...if in vanilla or tbc).
---
If you want to be a good
---
healer play priest
---
tank play warrior
---
meele play rouge or warrior
---
caster play mage (warlock does not cast. He dots. And fears)
---
If you just want to have need on every loot - play hunter!
---
If we can trust PServers, druids are quickly becoming seen as better and better tanks due to their huge amounts of damage and threat generation.  Though, we will have to see how it plays out at 60 if it was just a miscalculation on the PServers part.
---
But historically, yes, warriors were usually the best tanks for raiding, with druids only having case-by-case uses as tanks.
---
My main gripe with him is the low effort "content" he puts out.
---
I'd much rather have 1 solid video a week, than 5 low effort ones.
---
Just personal opinion though.
---
If you dont like it, dont watch it. + the beta will get bigger once more people are invited. These beta invites always go out in waves
---
Check out staysafe's interview where talk about the same stuff.

---
Who wants 1k players in elwynn anyways, tho.
---
They are suppose to be neutral. Only Defias folks are aggresive in Northshire :)
---
That‚Äôs dick of you.
---
I don't get why not playing during vanilla is a factor. Shit does my opinion not matter because I decided to be born in middle of no where in Ireland and didn't fucking have internet til BC came out? I don't get why playing a 14 year old game is a factor when any one who played it can't really remember what its like. He's play the private servers like the rest of us and that's all of our reference points
---
There's an unwritten rule in game development never delete code you already wrote it might be useful later , just hide it from the user
---
It's WallpaperEngine so yeah, it will loop without cuts
---
My guess is that it's actually both; when Tips was talking about mana, he was referring to their level 40 characters, whereas all we've seen so far in beta is low level regen, so I'd say regen is higher in low levels and lower in higher levels.
---
Just a theory though.
---
Is it possible to get Stan‚Äôs armor?
---
Once you reach lv30 the beta sort of stops. They will probably play a week and maybe jump in later during stress tests. 27 aug is still very far away
---
Tell me, does enemies run around obstacles like they used to?
---
Retail makes mobs ignore obstacles and makes them run through them, like fences or wheelbarrows, etc.
---
Lots of people here not understanding what this topic is for. "I remember \[x\] was different" for something that was 13 years ago is not gonna cut it.
---
Please stop spewing misinformation.
---
sad with money and sad without money are both sad mate
---
theres something weird about streamers
---
Thanks for asking that, I too will be playing via a Mac so was hoping (assuming) that the Classic game will run as normal via the retail install.
---
He does that shit because it something that requires little work and allow him to interact with his fans, none of which is true when dealing with a limited access beta.
---
Well, reporting it is one solution to make the devs see it, instead of almost aggressively screaming "WHAT THE FUCK". Since having two Fear debuffs on two seperate mobs isn't possible on Retail either it is definitely not intended.
---
It was my experience that they did very little dps or threat generation but as I say I must be misremembering them. It would open things up a bit if more than one class could tank but then I hope it‚Äôs as close to classic as we can get
---
Are they preventing young girls from receiving education in Guatemala? Does a percentage of their proceeds go toward supporting al-Qaeda? Do Activision employees euthanize healthy puppies on weekend team-building events?
---
I think we have differing definitions of **REALLY UNETHICAL SHIT**.
---
If that list will prevent you from playing Classic WoW, then you are going to struggle finding a game you can play. Shit, you are going to struggle finding a car to drive, a bank to bank at, and a store to shop in. Business is a harsh mistress. Ain't hardly anybody's hands clean, my friend.
---
I'm okay with streamers getting first dibs on invites.  The more content they create early on will only generate more hype for the game.
---
Edit !
---
That would make a great deal more sense since the steam has been going on all night.
---
So many people that LIVE for vanilla wow, streamers and normal players alike, none of them get an invite. Meanwhile you have cata babys that farm transmog and have shit talked classic for years PLAYING THE BETA RIGHT NOW.
---
Blizzard aren't doing this beta for bugs or feedback whatsoever.
---
The guy is involved in some crazy shit, think he started a cult of sorts, and his own crypto currency scheme where he got his viewers to buy it or something. Not someone I want back in the scene any time soon!
---
I wish they would make a classic catagory they are 2 different games
---
dont want poor children making the mistake of thinking people are playing retail
---
I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised by was taken a back a little by the most blatant of clickbaiting by those who I thought were serious streamers
---
Canadian lol, but that may as well be true as well
---
Layers are intended to be semi permanent for the duration of a session. Each layer contains an entire server population of players. 
---
If a given layer is 2500 people, what‚Äôre the odds you and your friends are deposited into can different layers in the first place? Once you get online, are you going to track who‚Äôs been online in the guild longest, and thus most likely to be on a different layer than those most recently to come online? 99.99% of people won‚Äôt. 
---
The few who do for resource spawn are die hard try hard‚Äîthe sort that exploit if they knew one‚Äîand pussies on PvP servers.
---
Yeah I see what you mean, however every other sentence in that paragraph is referring to tester selection criteria so it seems pretty safe to assume. Actually I want to say it was worded differently when I first read it on Monday but maybe I'm just misremembering.
---
Strafing is different when you're targetting an enemy and if you have nothing selected.
---
When targetting someone your whole character turns to face that way
---
Clip from perplexity's stream: https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/AliveNeighborlyDonkeyAMPEnergyCherry
---
Wait, what do you mean by promoting this for free?
---
You're entitled to an opinion even if it's wrong i suppose.
---
No, you just dont understands hit, warriors dont regen that fast... I played a warrior in vanilla and remember it well, i even have videos of me back in the day doing random shit.
---
You do not regen fast after level 10, you need to eat..
---
I fixed it :

Could of been playing with a full world for the past 5 years lol.
---
Which he has been doing for years since he's been streaming. WoW is the only thing he wants to stream so why would he stop playing it? i'm sure he will be fine.. The only streamer that's known that would get burned out is probably Towelliee since he hates Vanilla.
---
I think his videos even got DMCA'd or something because Blizzard thought he had filmed a private server with his old footage.
---
Exactly. I despise question thats why I thought I would never ever ever play classic but if the community is huge and fun, I might struggle through it just to play a game with a great community
---
Both of these are known issues on pserver cores.
---
Enemy mobs on vanilla are \*in general\* softer and some lower levels than they are on pservers.  
---
On the other hand, some enemy mobs in vanilla will hit harder, due to their spells and AI actually working, where they were likely broken on pservers.
---
No, you can be friends with someone and be put on different layers
---
&gt; sad with money and sad without money are both sad mate
---
If you're sad with millions in the bank, you seriously lack perspective and creativity.
---
Well with 15 years of theorycrafting and playtime on PServers, people were able to figure out that at full minmax mode like what we see in today's raid scene, everyone does so much damage that a tank needs to be able to match threat.  Warriors were tanking in fury spec and dual-wielding, and druids used the Manual Crowd Pummeler from Gnomer to do as much damage and threat as possible.
---
Like I said, it is yet to be seen if that was just a function of PServers having their numbers wrong, or is this will be the case once classic goes live.
---
People have been QQing about small UI changes like this since it was announced.
---
What stuck out to me was folks that appeared they've never played WoW at all or at least have never seen anything other than a pserver.
---
I'd argue WoW is exactly just that - a game. The thing is "game" have had a bit of a bad stigma for a long time as a waste of time.
---
WoW is just a game, the thing is a game can be a wonderful thing. Some people read books, some people do sport, some play music and *some play games.* Regardless of parents thinking "oh, but it is such a waste of time, it is better to read or do sport" gaming is a hobby exactly like those other things.
---
Personally one of the most important things to me is playing music. Playing several hours a day, always having music in my ears when I can't play myself. Still, I would say gaming is equally important to me.
---
Fortunately, with the rise of Esport it actually seems like gaming is being seen better than it used to.
---
Right, but I can go watch jooana's videos from 2005-2006, compare them to classic stream gameplay, and clearly be able to tell mana regen is fucked.
---
Yes it's disappointing that they got it wrong again (or something is bugged), but it's definitely not right.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236
---
Basically it's dynamic and in most cases won't be needed after a few weeks. He stated that regardless of server size it will be gone in all cases after p1
---
classic wow and retail wow have nothing to do with each other i hope so
---
What a mess this thread is, nobody knows what a bug even is
---
There's nothing I want to particularly want to rush for, since the progression is only partial. If it was a full progression, I'd definitely want to rush and do the content that happened before my time...basically is just Pre-BWL patch MC and Ony. I did pretty much everything else, I just didn't get into raiding until later since I played mostly during off-hours on my server till  I changed jobs.
---
So who knows, I might make a Profession guy to sell gear at cost for fellow lowbies.
---
They deserve the golds from 1 layer not from 3 layers, no ?
---
This topic made me nostalgic.
---
It's just people being salty.  I'm sad too, that I didn't get into the first wave of invites, but at least I can live vicariously through streamers until August.
---
CLEARLY! Except Ion didn't say that at all, he said they'd gradually reduce the number of layers over the weeks after launch until there was only 1, and it would be 100% gone well in time for P2
---
Every thread there have to be someone who think they are fucking enlightened by whining about whining, especially when there isn't any real amounts of whining to start with.
---
So? They don't in this thread. This thread is literally full of people praising this change. I just found it funny how you went all batshit from the start when everyone in this thread are positive.
---
Come one, it's just a bit of fun.
---
FYI Shroud was an avid wow player
---
Delusional twitch boy. Is this what the new generation is about - being happy about being sidelined?
---
/thread
---
Blizzard suck ass. Not okay!
---
Best case it should only last a few weeks.
---
However, I am wondering if, like last time vanilla launched, we are all underestimating how popular the game will be and we end up with way too many people.  At least blizz has a bunch of extra servers on standby, this time, just in case...
---
Unless streamers like Ninja, Timthetatman etc. REALLY like a game, they are usually sponsored by the dev-studio to play it for a certain amount of hours.
---
They will play classic even though they wont get payed.
---
On the other hand, don‚Äôt you earn more now than back in 2004? If not, RIP
---
They said they promise it will be gone before phase 2 because of world bosses. They also said something about it being removed as soon as possible. 
---
People are assuming it will only last a month since the population will probably have levelled out by then and people will be spread throughout the world, but who knows, maybe classic will continue to grow and we‚Äôll be stuck with it until they make more servers lel
---
wow I now understand when people say memories can be wrong, I was convinced the laborers in the mine were the first hostile mobs a human player encountered! ty mate
---
Ah, I'm so glad they decided to keep this feature.
---
Regardless of how you feel about retail wow, one thing that always impressed me was the art and music in every zone and expansion.  Huge props to blizz for that.
---
And that's every 2 seconds.  
---
So if you had 0 mana it would take you 7 ticks, or 14 seconds to regen to full after not casting for 5 seconds.
---
I've just been getting YouTube recommendations to watch WoW ambience soundtracks and I've just been falling asleep to them.
---
Streamers and YouTubers are a part of the hype cycle and SHOULD be. It makes sense in multiple ways.
---
My beef is that there are a few streamers who didn't care for classic and even heckled the community until Blizz came knocking.
---
That's not a good look for your game.
---
Streamers and YouTubers yes, but nix the toxic asaholes. You don't have to be all in on WoW, but definitely don't pick the d-bags that screw with the community to represent your game.
---
NARU-cocaine sir
---
I wonder what blizzard is trying to test because so far is sounds like they‚Äôve just give a bunch of personality a chance to generate a bit of publicity. Because the stress test I can think of that blizzard will want to preform is a lunch day test which would mean resetting everyone‚Äôs progress to zero again.
---
&gt; ok, link the logs? Since armory is saying you havent:
---
How about you just look at the page you just linked?
---
&gt; Gear = stats = stronger. This trivialises mechanics that would otherwise 1 shot you etc.
---
You're right, it does... in retail, it doesn't in classic because the scaling is completely out of control in retail.
---
&gt; For example, the latest round of Jaina nerfs make her a complete joke
---
So killing the boss is a complete joke, yet it's simultaniously hard... I'm sorry, that doesn't make any sense.
---
&gt; You want to heal with vivify? You aren't moving.
---
But what makes you unable to move while casting mists or essence font?
---
Chuck Norris can bake a cake in the freezer!
---
My life has been consumed by thoughts of classic for the past 6 months and I still can‚Äôt fathom why people are so obsessed with the idea of playing an incomplete beta. If you want to play a broken version of vanilla that badly go play a private server. I‚Äôd much rather have other people test the game and point out bugs than do it myself.
---
We think that because they said a few weeks to 1 month, BUT, up to the end of phase 1.
---
So it's more than likely you who got the info wrong, OP. There's a ton of quotes and info about it if you put the effort in to search what was ACTUALLY said.

Someone said to me recently ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it kind of sad, a grown man playing computer games instead of going out and doing things‚Äù. 
---
Well honestly, i‚Äôm a grown man, so i can do whatever the fuck i want. That‚Äôs the whole point! You only get one life, and at the end of the day you only feel your own feelings. I‚Äôm happy with who i am, and i‚Äôm gonna do the things that make me happy! 
---
Some people are just kind of immature and are probably pretty sad tbh, imagine being so stuck in societal norms that you can‚Äôt even play a fun computer game.
---
It's hype day so if you want to build subs today was the day to stream as long as possible. I don't think any of the guys playing today will be going for or getting server first 60s when it launches except maybe staysafe.
---
So in classic, if I want to play on the same server as my friends we need to create characters around the same time to be in the same layer? Or does the layering happen each time you log in?
---
Nah its Muru brand. No wants that generic Naaru stuff.
---
Nice.
---
My boss pretty much said "Nope" when asking about changing summer holiday. Feelsbadman
---
Asmongold does fuck all most of the time and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs prepared for just how terrible levelling a warrior is but I‚Äôve been told it only for like three days so maybe he‚Äôll get lucky and get denied the chance to burn out.
---
Towelie, "the retail shill," of course
---
Exactly, also a lot of late game stuff is instance based, and so not as much of a direct competition issue.
---
Blizzard has offered free realm xfers off of overpopulated servers before. So reroll or quit aren't the only two options. If they have an overpopulated server with a queue time and they offer free xfers to a low pop server for a brief time then the problem will partially correct itself.
---
I think I ended up leaving darkspear(?) as a result of one of these free xfers but I can't be sure. It's been so long.
---
Can you name a few examples ? I certainly heard doubts and criticism on whether or not classicc will succeed but I havent heard anyone be "toxic" or a douchebag about it
---
So because I'm not 12 my input isn't valid?
---
while i dont mind things that dont effect gameplay it does show a pretty piss poor attention to detail.
---
are they trying to replicate vanilla or not? stuff like this encourages people to ask for other QOL changes 
---
if i wanted all the modern QOL changes id play retail
---
As they should, then the devs can check the reference 1.12. and it's either right or wrong. If it's wrong no harm done, if it's right then they fixed a bug.
---
But they literally get paid for streaming it.
---
what happened to the paladin 1"-pre raid bis" gear? I am missing the crit sword from maraudon as well as the green plate wrists
---
I don't think it was a joke. If it was then I missed it. But I wasn't trying to be an asshole.
---
So I can't laugh?
---
The question is, will they reset character progression and give templates because right now people are just going ham.
---
Even though I can understand you point of view completely, I personally cant wait to play the beta.
---
Its the same with spoilers for movies or tv-shows. Most people hate them but I love spoiling myself by reading leaked scripts etc. 
---
None of us are in the wrong though its just personal preference and not at all  connected to the people I was targeting with this post
---
This is still in? Wow. Like Warlocks need to be more OP. Now they can move up to the top if they are an alt?
---
That kind of power is dangerous and upsets the balance of the whatever.
---
And the guy you reported?
---
I'm guessing you OP.
---
Completely agree, if theres one thing in life we should be doing, its what makes us happy.
---
I randomly got an invite for the classic wow beta back in the days, which was awesome because all my friends preordered (which included beta access) while I was going for the collectors edition.
---
That's the only one I ever got. I feel salty every time I don't get one but then again I still feel joy thinking about how much luck I had back then. I went fucking apeshit when I got that mail. I was super afraid of a scam, so I carefully marked and copy pasted the activation key, avoiding clicking anything in the email, and then manually went to the activation page and it fucking worked. What were the odds? I couldn't fucking believe my luck.
---
what exactly do you expect ? i cant exactly login to vanilla to double check things
---
i have like 1 video reference from the end of vanilla i need to test the rest from memory
---
Everyone is saying this. But I don't think Blizzard has ever based their first beta invite waves on the people that have played their games the longest.
---
Wow..that is so stupid :/  
---
Joana has contributed so much to vanilla/now classic WoW
---
I'd pay even without free sub.
---
He broke the rules of the thread when he cursed at me.
---
You cursed too
---
They would get paid for streaming ANYTHING. You are not getting my point.
---
The fact that these streamers are streaming the game shows that they care about it. It massively benefits the classic community (except for the few gatekeepers I suppose).
---
Im sure some of them do it because of the hype but they could instead just pick a mobile game sponsorship and earn 10x what they would earn during a classic wow stream.
---
I don‚Äôt even have a subscription, I won‚Äôt subscribe again until the game officially released before I intend to take it nice and slow.
---
Some skills like that Curse in SFK from the guardsmen even specifically lowers your innate class skills, including skills that don't normally have skills associated with them. (it's the ones after Odo that put up a curse that randomly gives a random skill debuff).
---
Toweldry or whatever that scrub's name is has been toxic to the community before. He's not a good rep, IMO.
---
Blizz should definitely pick folks that stream, even folks who might not be super interested to at least check it out, but picking folks that are known to treat the classic community like shit is no bueno.
---
CTFU = cracking the fuck up. Not cursing at him.
---
Great advice üëçüëåüëçüëå
---
You said the f word. Reporting you again
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425207655](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425207655)  15:56:50  
---
454/524 HP and roughly 25 Spirit so 20.48 per tick every 2 sec  
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425207655](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425207655) 15:56:52   
---
473/524  
---
So 473-454 = 19HP regen per tick  
---
So best case scenario it is 2-3 point lower or higher but not "DURR THEY ARE HEALING LIKE DISCI PRIEST DERP"  
---
Also take this in count  
---
* Health Regeneration is increased by 33% while sitting.
---
* Trolls regenerate 110% of this amount while out of combat, and 10% of this amount while in combat.  
---
Plus Rogue HP REGEN was like this    
---
[Spirit](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit) \* 0.50 + 2 in the 1.09 Patch Notes so if somebody can countercheck...
---
I dont think you really understand why people are angry, this is how atleast i feel about the situation.
---
I, myself dont give 2 shits about if i get the beta or not, if i get it i'll play, if i dont get it, no big deal.
---
The reason im alittlebit angry is that every big boy streamer gets an invite because of money reasons and not actually improving the game for when its released to the "normal people".
---
There are several big streams that started after Vanilla, they never play it, so they dont know what should do what, and how things was back then. Now, im not saying they dont bring anything to the testing, surely they'll notice some really important gameplay-breaking bugs.
---
But people that actually played alot back then (even normal people), that KNOW or atleast remember how things worked/feel back then dont get an invite, because money is more important that having a great product at launch. A prime example is Joana, no invite because not a big streamer, this person probably knows more about vanilla WoW than alot of the streamers combined.
---
some pservers*
---
like good luck finding 1080p video from back then too lol
---
its like low res or nothing
---
the world of roguecraft videos were pretty high res but that was all high level and in combat
---
I got access but don't want to ruin the surprise for myself
---
But when new potential player checks wow section he might open a bfa stream and gets driven away from the game.
---
I would agree with this specific example. He has done scummy shit in the past and I personally dislike him as well. 
---
I just think that people him are few and far between and we shouldn't generalize it
---
You got me xD
---
If you‚Äôve never played any MMO, maybe try BFA (or a vanilla pserver) so you aren‚Äôt totally lost and clueless at launch, know about basic mechanics and roles etc
---
Otherwise just wait for classic imo
---
Fuck that fat fuck
---
or the unwritten blizzard rule, hide it in the secret room under the Deadmine's galleon.
---
Well I live in Germany and we've got 30 days here. Which is 1.5 months if you are able to take them all at once.
---
We also don't have sick days here. If you're sick, you're sick. Most companies also only make you go to the doctor when you're sick longer than 2 days, so practically you can stay home for 2 days and not even go the doctor.
---
This right here is a good argument to allow layering for exactly 7 days and then no more. 
---
If starting zones are shit afterwards then tough. If there has to be a queue time bc of overpopulation then so be it. I think preserving the economy is too important.
---
Templates should become available if blizz wants specific stuff tested.  Also, I would not be surprised if there were periodic character wipes.  Those are common in most beta tests.  Or, if not, they might just raise the level cap every now and then...
---
As always the people in this sub will say Classic
---
And they're correct
---
I played on pservers. Loved the game. Subbed for retail WoW and played it. It's fun for killing time. Can't say I didn't have fun playing it. Classic is more competitive and hard, which I like. In my opinion Classic is the much better game. But retail is a chill game.
---
So if you just wanna relax and kill time, retail is good. If you really want to get into WoW the right way, I would wait for Classic.
---
&gt;  Since having two Fear debuffs on two seperate mobs isn't possible on Retail either it is definitely not intended.
---
Who gives a shit what's on retail? I remember warlocks fearing more than one target but in all likelihood it could've been pre-1.12.
---
&gt;How about you just look at the page you just linked?
---
How about you point out exactly which mythic end boss I'm over looking, since as far as I can tell that page shows none.
---
&gt;You're right, it does... in retail, it doesn't in classic because the scaling is completely out of control in retail.
---
It's not 'out of control' its designed so that worse players can clear content over time. Hence why they also apply nerfs to bosses.
---
To that effect, WHEN you kill a boss is very important. 
---
It's a very conscious design choice and not "out of control".
---
&gt;So killing the boss is a complete joke, yet it's simultaniously hard... I'm sorry, that doesn't make any sense.
---
This is a non sequitur. The boss *was* difficult. Now it has been nerfed to oblivion and people are also over gearing it because they want people to get to experience / kill the boss.
---
Any competitive guild views BoD tier as over at this point. Crucible is already out too.
---
&gt;But what makes you unable to move while casting mists or essence font?
---
I'm not sure what your point is here. One is a channeled cast you can use while moving, and the other is an instant cast like a rejuvenation.
---
EF isn't something you want to just pop, it's something you use at specific times. Especially because of its interaction in that it applies a buff to targets hit which makes your mastery (gust) proc twice when you activate it on someone.
---
How do you activate it? With Vivify.
---
So, if the encounter is constantly forcing movement then it is literally impossible to "perform to their maximum while moving.".
---
Did anyone confirm this yet? Dont want to continue my sub if there isn't anymore rollouts.
---
 - The world makes sense again...
---
 - Taking a picture of your screen
---
Pick one...
---
Now where's the "triggered reddit nerd" starter pack?
---
All kobolds outside of the starting 1-6 human area should be red. Thats how its been since the first private server
---
its a bug and shold be treated as such, its not a report bugs you dont like beta
---
How much does the beta last
---
Don't let the salt get to you {yours or anyone elses).  Stay hungry, though, you'll get you chance to play before you know it...
---
For the love of gods, hold out and wait for Classic!
---
Personally I‚Äôd suggest starting with WoW, they have done so much to the starting zones since classic, making it easier to learn and less of a grind, it is completely different and a great way to dive in, in the few months you will know how the basic mechanics work, etc. then go try classic, it will be different, don‚Äôt expect it to just be a simpler version, once you have played both for a bit then you can decide which you prefer, which classes you like, horde vs alliance and which you will play on mostly.
---
they don't know. It depends on how successful the project is and what the community looks like by the end of Phase 6.
---
We might see TBC-Classic servers. 
---
We might see never before seen Post-Naxx content that goes in different directions from what it originally did.
---
Or it might not do well enough financially that they feel it's not worth continuing and simply leave it as a museum piece to visit.
---
REEEEEEEEEE THIS WILL DESTROY CLASSIC WHERE DO I SIGN REMOVAL PETITION
---
I can understand why some people do care. To most it's not a big deal but some people want to literally feel like they're back in 2004 playing vanilla wow and all these small changes to UI are easily noticeable to most vets and ruins that feel.

REEEEeeeEeeeeEEEEe
---
You do realise that when I say days I mean actual 24 hours...So 8 days = 192 hours. 8 entire days. Not, I started on Monday and by Tuesday next week I'll be 60...
---
Hi, /u/catastrophicprophet
---
Who can do it better? a hobbyist amateur? or Blizzard?
---
First of all thanks for engaging in an actual argument but I still disagree
---
&gt; every big boy streamer gets an invite because of money reasons 
---
This is true. No arguing here. However I am saying that this benefits everyone. Blizz will make more cash. The streamer will make more cash. More big streamers playing wow = more people playing wow which is a win for me because I feel like the community makes or breaks classic. 
---
&gt; and not actually improving the game for when its released to the "normal people".
---
I agree. Shroud wont go out of his way to report bugs and make sure that we will get a classic experience. But thats what we are for.
---
Sooner or later most people will get an invite to the closed beta. And even if they dont there will be an open beta as well.
---
We will all have enough time to provide feedback and from that point on, its blizzards responsibillity to improve the game based on the feedback
---
&gt; There are several big streamers that started after Vanilla, they never actually played Classic, so they dont know what should do what, and how things was back then. Now, im not saying they dont bring anything to the testing, surely they'll notice some really important gameplay-breaking bugs.
---
Betas these days are not made for testing purposes only. half of the people in this sub wont report a single bug because they'll just play it like a private server. Again the real beta testers and the people that care will get the opportunities
---
&gt; But people that actually played alot back then (even normal people), that KNOW or atleast remember how things worked/feel back then dont get an invite, because money/hype is more important that having a great product at launch. A prime example is Joana, no invite because not a big streamer, this person probably knows more about vanilla WoW than alot of the streamers combined.
---
She will get an invite soon enough. Do not tell me that you believe that whether classic will be great or shit depends on Joana having a beta invite 2 weeks too late. Of course its sad that the most dedicated people have to wait but don't be childish about it. 
---
Streamers having safe access is an overall positive for classic wow
---
What's the life tap icon doing as a 10 min buff?
---
No, because your input is worthless.
---
I meant if you can physically see them in game, and your not group, they are in the same layer already, so grouping won't change layer
---
It's tempting to message you for help, but to be honest I just need to  move my ass and earn some money for myself. It's a great thing you're doing though and I applaud you for being so generous.
---
yes bcs dota players started complaining that they cant find dota streams at all, otherwise there wouldnt be new category.
---
On the one hand, you say classic will be more popular than the live game, but on the other hand you say that the people o the official forums saying these things aren't the intended audience. Who IS the intended audience and what makes you think that they outnumber the the non-intended audience (those who prefer to play the live game)?
---
Geniunely curious here, I'm not trying to start some shit. I personally don't see Classic overtaking the live game at any point except possible for the release and the few weeks, maybe a month or two afterwards. But I'm fairly certain that a vast majority of the people who create a character on the classic servers will drop off before they hit 60.
---
That is possible but if you add in the 6k to 16k viewers from retail the position on twitch will be higher making more people check it out. So let's say it is a 70/30 whether they click a BFA stream vs classic (which is very generous because I think the first three rows will always be classic and people tend to primarily stop after that) just having the higher number of people looking at stream with a 70% chance to be classic will result in more people overall watching a classic stream.
---
100% wait for classic.
---
Are you using tips as your baseline for a good streamer? LOL
---
thats a scroll of Spirit.
---
You probably played on a private server also we have the video proof of him ticking the "right", Mandela Effect is bitch i know.
---
yeah I'm quite confused as to why it's capped at 30
---
&gt; And also "You are complaining that these people are promoting the game that you love FOR FREE because they love it as well"
---
This is nowhere near this simple of a topic. Its their JOB to stream, if they play classic (which is the new most popular thing) they earn more money because more people watch them, and if they enjoy playing it its a double win. We dont need to thank any of these people for streaming it, its their job, and their hobby.
---
Somewhat true. I agree that its not this simple of a topic and that we need to "thank them" or anything like that.
---
All I am saying is that it benefits us and the fact that they COULD do something that would earn them more money like mobile sponsorships is a good sign that these people are passionate about the game
---
I'm in the same boat as you, I'm super salty, lol. 
---
I did everything I could to try and get "noticed". Bought two of those $350 wow statues from their store (you never know what might flag your account?)
---
I turned back on my wow account, even though I'll never play BFA
---
I connected the Bnet app thing to my twitch that I'm on 7 days a week. 
---
Now I wait. 
---
Agreed we can't all get in, but at least some sort of "here's our criteria" a few months in advance would have been nice, so those of us dedicated enough could actually get in. I mean, isn't that the end goal? Get dedicated players in for 3 months that will find bugs? 
---
/rant
---
2 Months, I think. They'll probably do it in three phases, where there's an open beta towards the end, but now that it's being advertised the wait seems way longer
---
i dont think so, simikar thing just happened with dota2 and auto chess, DotA category started to get 2x or 3x mroe viewers but ppl couldnt find dota streamers at all there so they complained heavily and twitch had to make Auto chess category.
---
Yeah sure I'll share my non beta invite, here you go:
---
Can you explain why?
---
Remind them when they go watch any kind of super hero movie or nerd content that is now mainstream.
---
Just not really a valid sample size to contradict what was said above - Sorry if I sounded like a dick.
---
I know man, I know. They'll probably do it in three phases, where there's an open beta towards the end, but now that it's being advertised the wait seems way  longer, haha
---
Does it wipe afterwards on official release? If yes why even care, you'll be more motivated if you go in fresh
---
Which I stated in the following sentence, immediately. Use your eyes and your brain mate.
---
Some streamers are getting less viewers because they want to try out the Classic beta. See Shroud for example who played it for a couple hours even though his fan base is almost exclusively interested in FPS/TPS games.
---
Worst example of a sellout, don't understand how he even has any audience
---
I'm still sceptical about how this actually solves the launch problem that sharding solves(not that I'm a fan of either)... 
---
If 9k people are on a server and are split across 3 layers, that's 3k people per layer. There are 6 starter zones, so assuming an equal split (most likely won't be equally split, and some will have a lot more such as northshire), there is going to be 500 people in esch starter zone. That's easily enough to slow down the whole experience for everyone and is the exact problem they were trying to fix. 
---
I think if they're doing layering, they need to do sharding inside each layer for a couple of days to allow people to get out the starter zone and spread out due to different levelling paces.
---
I wish streamers would hurry up and not be a thing any more. It‚Äôs literally the lamest thing and just elevated these awful people with no skills to feel like the are a somebody.
---
I have day 1 EU acc too and no inv, so i doubt it.
---
&gt; might not happen at all.
---
False. They repeatedly stated that they will turn it off before Phase 1 ends.
---
Your experience during the first few levels will determine how you feel about any mmorpg for rest of its life. I say better to wait for classic release or you will always judge it by live wow standers.
---
It finally makes sense!!
---
You know that was TBC?
---
Been unsubbed for years and still am unsubbed. 
---
I've waited 11 years to play Classic. A few more moths is nothing. Although, if I get hit by a car between now &amp; Aug 27th I'll be a little upset.
---
ok so it's large scale sharding, I want to see 6000 people on at once in my vicinity not only 3000....
---
 I dont think its salt, but giving beta key to a guy that is known to hate vanilla wow crowd is just another proof how disconnected Blizzard is from the actual community. Why not hand out keys to people that actually knows classic wow and could contribute tons more than just run around mindlessly and saying everything looks fine.
---
cringe
---
More motivated, but also really far behind, because beta players get a 3 month head start on learning where to quest and grind. 
---
True you can google it, but the experience of actually doing it is much better. Hands-on goes a lot further than watching a video.  
---
Being even 1 level a head of the pack is enough to get you into open areas with mobs not being tagged. 
---
I know they have their new tech to solve a bit of that, but watching streamers today, they were all struggling to tag mobs.
---
Well said
---
Fwiw, the bestiary has been proven to have wrong values on armor. There is many videos on different vanilla bosses which contain enough information to calculate almost exact armor value and it was quite wrong in bestiary (3731 actual vs 4700 bestiary or so).
---
Chuck Norris doens't get wet. Water gets Chuck Norris.
---
Hey, don't know you? It isn't about the end goal, it's about the journey \*insert Kappa\* lol 
---
That's some dedication right there and you should have gotten rewarded for that - a beta key should have came with that for sure
---
Exactly though, they should have let people know how they were going to send out invites, so that they could prepare their community. However, they have been too focused on money
---
It‚Äôs so funny these children don‚Äôt see it as it is. Totally with you on this. If you are watching and donating and subbing to a streamer you are literally a marketers dream - we are laughing at you.
---
This is next level editing, more of this!
---
Since the 1.13 Classic version uses a freaking reverse-engineered 8.0 client, it is more relevant regarding bugs than any shitty private server values and videos that may get posted as reference.
---
Warlocks were never able to fear more than one target because of this:
---
    PTR client.png Patch 0.6 (2004-04-13):
---
        
---
       *  When Fear wears off, you will no longer keep running.
---
       * Can now only be used on one target at a time. 
---
Unless it is a bug, of course. You can hate on retail all you want but it is bound to have certain bugs found on retail, since it uses the same client as a base.
---
Me: 
---
paoper:
---
Thanks you!
---
Troll Racial + Sit , so 10% Racial and 33% Sit bonus
---
My only problem is that most of these content creators have no interest in reporting bugs or helping to ensure consistency. They care only about generating clicks and views.
---
Why so negative man?
---
They usually cap it at the start of betas and then up it later on as it progresses. But then again, might be different for classic but im betting my money on what I said in the beginning.
---
Quissy? Or something? Yea I was watching that too, the whole dungeon looked a ton better, shadows and lighting I suppose. Whoever was the Gnome was super fucking annoying though.
---
&gt;Some people pay to go watch the WNBA
---
Not many though.
---
Probably not because classic wow will use legion game client, which is pretty recent. Also, you can't upgrade de graphic drivers of mac laptops, so thats a no go also, your only solution should be getting a new machine, if you need any help doing that, throw me a private message.
---
What are you talking about now?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
*Not yet in the game
---
its built on a completely different client and libraries compared to vanilla though ...
---
Clueless.  
---
- Not everyone 'only has private servers' as reference points.   
---
- It makes total sense to criticize someone who acts as a guide and community member for vanilla WoW when said guide has never even played that version of vanilla WoW.
---
- TipsOut cares more about his subscriber total than about the actual game. Honestly this last point says it all.
---
Exactly and there is no other possible way to counter them because they'll be able to hop to other layers when your PvP group comes to kill them.
---
Yes do it.
---
It won't be very different from pservers in my opinion, either way I'm not paying 15‚Ç¨ to get access to a beta.
---
Fun fact: He is also a Castlevania speedrunner.
---
I saw him at AGDQ (under a different name I believed), and in the interview after his run he casually talked about how he actually was _the_ Joana, and how WoW "speedruns" are so much different from what he does now. Blew my mind.
---
Fair enough.
---
It's a Mac Pro, not a Macbook Pro.
---
Seems like a solid design.
---
I actually wanted this :D
---
never, ever, ever, ever have your boss join your guild or add you as a friend in wow   
---
they can check your last logged in time to see those days you were supposedly so sick you couldnt get out of bed but still managed to level up 15 times today
---
What about Joanas?
---
I am more bummed about the nights...it doesn't feel nighty at all.
---
Illegal is a bit of a stretch
---
Shitty streamers don't make any money for Blizz. Let's just face it. Whoever is responsible this PR section (Classic beta and information flow in general) is a fucking moron.
---
No the mobs are doing correct damage. Best source is watch old school Joanna‚Äôs videos. Pretty much all damage lines up perfectly.
---
Like Anilusion said, this should be treated as a real beta.
---
And given how vocal some streamers were about the interest for classic WoW this is not a bad step, as I think a lot of them will take it more seriously and report any bugs seen while playing. 
---
All while hyping the game up till release. 
---
Sure some will abuse it and won't contribute anything, but that's the same with normal betas though.
---
Uhm i didnt look at the post and got so many answers.
---
Thanks guys ill wait for classic.
---
Any guides (readable) u could suggest me?
---
If you're in the same layer yes, and grouping does change layers, see this video  https://i.4cdn.org/vg/1557985481624.webm
---
They need large scale testing not just stress testing, how leveling is from 30-60 and how broken raids.
---
Serious question: 
---
Whats the difference between a 6k pop 2 layered server with basically 200% of resources and two 3k pop classic server with 100% (the normal amount) of resources. 
---
You have more resources, but you will also have more demand.
---
Where am I wrong?
---
I wouldn't say really far behind, but you'll fall behind nonetheless if you're trying to speed-level. I personally don't think that's a huge deal, considering that on release there will be an astronomical amount of players around; this will make it easier to catch up through the buddy system. As an example, Asmongold was consistently rising and falling through the ranks when it came to the highest level(s) on the server. However, they flew to the top of the list when they started getting gear - if you have somebody else there to catch you, it makes the game easier
---
If you like competitive and hard, you'd be better off on retail for both PVP and PVE. Especially PVE which is far far harder on retail (mythic raiding). 
---
That said, classic will be more fun outside of raiding :p
---
 Stop showing clips of very buggy game, rather post memes, be thankful to blizz and go watch sellout streamers that will hype you up.
---
What if what I want to do is hate streamers
---
&gt;No. Its hard. At least compared to anything they are likely to have played recently.
---
Imagine Blizzard's face if after classic release the numbers for it were consistently higher then retail. 
---
There would be a lot of confused executives looking for answers.
---
there is hope for me then, restarted my sub when bata was announced and played for a large part of BFA. was worried that i had no chance of beta as i stopped my sub about 2-3 months ago as was getting bored of BFA
---
Point proven right there
---
Ahh OK, thanks alot for this
---
Damn I loved DArk Souls. I II and III. Also... thanks for the giggles. I could actually hear that  MRGLLRGLRLGRLGLRLGLRLGLRLGLLLL in my head. :D
---
Imagine having to use ur brain to finish something in a video game...ikr
---
You know it's not a 1 day beta right? It's continuous so
---
I think you're gonna have to wait for a proper review in a few months or watch some of the streams going on until then.
---
Exactly this. People are trying to treat the game as though it is retail, and then crying when it's not as easy or more time consuming - rather than focusing on just enjoying the game.
---
Daze is in. They‚Äôve been dazed but in late vanilla ithe chance to daze people below 30 I think was drastically lowered.
---
no they do not lol
---
You spent over 700 dollars to get into the beta?? Holy fuck man
---
Both of them played wow back in vanilla....
---
You can also toggle between them in-game :)

Asmongold Eating at lvl 17??? But wasnt suppose to instant heal up thx to massive regen?
---
Well by the looks of who's got beta access, it isn't gonna be tested well as none of these know anything about classic. Apart from the odd couple.
---
I dont care about beta only about finished product but...
---
What is the point of beta when it is used as content creators material.
---
Then name it "Content Creators Launch".
---
nice try tips
---
If you wanna play world of warcraft, wait for it's release in August. If you wanna play World of childpoop, feel free to start now
---
&gt; Why some peoples opinions are irrelevant. 
---
The older you get the more apparent and real this gets.
---
Raises hand.
---
You never know üòú
---
Some things were just bad, not though of or simply broken. Or do you want all bugs as well?
---
Wow that sounds like a risky undertaking. Good luck.
---
Layering (sharding but bigger) is one of the things that I am firmly against. Not only does it go against 1 server one world one community it also is more of a Band-aid then anything else. In the end of year December phase 2 will roll out.If some realms have a small amount of the so called tourist that left you'll still will have a server with 9k population if the 3 layers merge at end of phase 1.
---
there are variations of 1/29/21 
---
if u go with [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTrsc0dLVxfoso](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTrsc0dLVxfoso)

the 2 points from thick hide talent can be placed in any of the 3 (imp shred , blood frenzy , primal fury) - also points from feline swiftness can be moved around
---
dpsing as a cat without full feral commitment is not the best idea , u are missing 10% dmg 3% crit and omen - also u could tank some trash in raids but i wouldn't however u are perfectly fine tanking any 5 mans or offtanking 20s
---
i would focus on healing , tanking and pvp set
---
u can heal raids or dungeons perfectly fine with this spec and there are plenty of bis lists around when it comes to gearing (i always used this [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#) )
---
the pvp gear is basically rank gear + offpieces  (u want 4 pieces of r10 or 3pieces of r13 and fill other slots up with high stam/int pieces) - u will also carry engi boots helms and trinkets for this set
---
healing stats prio is +healing
---
tank stat prio is stam armor and hit
---
u profs should be engineering and herbing - engineering is a must since u are saying u want to pvp - herbing is great money maker and u can pick herbs in dm e when u are farming lashers  or in the world or in av

u will need an addon to show your mana while in forms and also a decent trinket addon - rooting someone than getting out of combat to put on death ray or helmets or reflectors is a game changer

also dont sell yourself short - ppl will need druids for raiding - there will be usually up to 3 druids in raid ,2 healers and 1 feral , with hotw u can take one fo the healer spots and take the garbage t1 gear that noone needs since its amazing for ranking - super high stam int and armor and its also great for dm farming - try to get the mace from domo asap - its one of the best pvp weapons other than ab exalted

I just completely avoid this problem by being on a pve-rp server muahahahahaha
---
lol he had to raid and after he was done he went back to classic Lol gtfo
---
Not everyone streams tough. Wait for the nex invite wave.
---
Other than bugs (hence beta) it is much closer than any private servers have been.
---
Aggro range definitely seems nerfed or bugged
---
Well yeah, because back then Blizzard shut down the best way to experience Classic WoW with no plans to actually support Classic WoW themselves. It was a pretty greasy move. Classic and live are two completely different games, Classic is an mmoRPG whereas live is like a multiplayer hack n slash. The people were getting mad because it effectively killed that game for them, for years. I was one of those people, thankfully I managed to get my char transferred to the LH pre server.
---
Reporting in for non minmaxing duty
---
&gt; It's not 'out of control' its designed so that worse players can clear content over time. Hence why they also apply nerfs to bosses.
---
So you can be bad and still kill bosses, that really does sound hard.
---
&gt; To that effect, WHEN you kill a boss is very important.
---
So hypothetically, if no one had killed Jaina and method went and got wf today, that would count for less than the wf they actually got?
---
&gt; I'm not sure what your point is here. One is a channeled cast you can use while moving, and the other is an instant cast like a rejuvenation.
---
My point is that you're not forced into turret mode while playing in retail, every class literally have the option to correct their position without it costing their performance.
---
&gt; So, if the encounter is constantly forcing movement then it is literally impossible to "perform to their maximum while moving.".
---
Now who's strawmanning, i never said anything about constant movement.
---
Yep, fairly certain that's a "feature" ;)
---
What gave that away Sherlock?
---
I'll occasionally look at the loot table for a dungeon I'm about to run to see what I might potentially get but for the most part casual lvling is the most fun for me: dueling with friends, engaging in world pvp and lvling professions while lvling is the way to go.
---
This, also I'd be happy enough to put a sub onto my account to be able to PLAY the beta, eg. get the beta guaranteed, need game time to play it. That way im not paying for something I may or may not get, i'd be paying for something I'm using.
---
I will... with my gf. And the another freetime not.
---
well im already subbed to retail just for a chance at classic
---
i could pretty easily level to 40 on retail if i wanted all the modern QOL changes
---
i dont mind in this case but its not very vanilla
---
You should‚Äôve straw polled this.
---
I‚Äôm going to try to be efficient with zone progression and earning gold, but will not be going for the full minmax powerlevel style of play. I‚Äôll still do dungeons and PvP, for example.
---
Its art
---
Lol this comment doesnt even make sense, people HAVE been crying on youtube, reddit, facebook hell probably even grindr about the UI changes, its not about THIS thread
---
And yet this thread was created. You shouldn't require validation from this sub for liking a game nor should you care what people think.
---
This seems to literally be what he's already doing. Not sure for how long though.
---
You need a subscription......  
---
All the info you need, is in that line.
---
Also this is perfectly findable on the BLizzard site.
---
Do you honestly believe that? Believing millions in the bank will keep you happy is a lack of perspective imo. But I am no millionaire, som what do I know.
---
Don't give that dildo the views
---
thx bro
---
And how is that any different to watching TV? Most twitch viewers don't spend any money, whereas you have millions of people paying for live TV and similar services.
---
Use video as evidence, anyone can remember anything they want.
---
Nope just the subscription which would get you up to Legion.
---
But I highly recommend BFA, the game is amazing mythic +‚Äôs, PvP and raids are the best content wow has ever had for competitive players.
---
When it comes to HP regen warriors just regened a lot more than other classes. Also at early levels your spirit keeps up with stamina but then later it doesnt so regen feels faster at low levels.
---
As example I think these were the formulas for regen in vanilla (you can see warrior has way more regen from spirit)
---
Warrior Pre-BC	Spirit * 0.80 + 6
---
Hunter Spirit * 0.25 + 6
---
I expect a lot more will go out to coincide with the stress test dates listed.
---
Well yeah, what would make me happy? Complete freedom, which a million in the bank offers. Great food, the ability to travel anywhere I want whenever I want, honestly I can't even begin to imagine how incredible life would be with that much money.
---
Onces the streamers get 25+ they will find it very hard to do dungeons because there are not enough players online. 
---
In 2-3 days this hype will be gone thats why they will hurry with the stress test, they know this hype wont last forever.
---
 After the first stress test the hype, on twitch, will be like 10% or less from what it is right now.
---
My 2c.
---
Thanks for the quick reply, i was just making a post to clarify.
---
You can play classic and everything other then bfa with a subscription only. If you would reach lvl 110 and wan't to go further you need bfa
---
I hope Towelie and Asmondgold.
---
Fuck those man childs
---
If you howl of terror 1 mob you can still fear another.
---
Just FYI, I was playing on Nostalrius on my macbook pro @ 60fps.
---
The two versions compliment eachother quite well. BFA is fast paced, instant action and hard content. Vanilla is slow, community based and more of an RPG.
---
Awesome, my obsession with having my characters in level order will be satisfied. üòå
---
It had actually been nagging at me. As exciting as classic is, what will happen to our servers after Naxx patch. I certainly hope that they at least give us more than 7 months of naxx and then also an option for some servers to never expand.
---
I would also like to see "classic TBC" at very least as a beta experiment. No flying. All of the content in the zone scaled to level 60 (the best level cap). Abilities unlocked via class quests. The existing raid content not being made entirely irrelevant. I know this is farfetched, wishful thinking.
---
Asmongold (blessed be his bald head) even said that he liked the TBC endgame, but didn't like how it made vanilla raids irrelevant. TBC leveling was meh anyways.
---
The continent of outlands could be interesting endgame content without having any leveling. Karazan could give gear roughly equal in quality to BWL or AQ20 drops (and so on).
---
I dinged 60 shortly before TBC launch (and was a scrub) but I still didn't like having my hard earned blues replaced by outland quest reward greens (which were way too OP).
---
I plan to take my time and enjoy the experience. Classic isn't going anywhere.
---
Oh don't get me wrong I hate towellie. But don't fucking complain because he had to raid for two hours before going back to classic.
---
# ITT: Butthurt OP.
---
This, but not only for twitch!  We need a dedicated youtube world of warcraft channel for this and others..
---
It actually is cheaper than it was in vanilla if you consider inflation.
---
Undead the only aggressive I remember where the spiders farther into the cave.
---
Everybody forget, there are no world/server first achievements anymore. Idk what the sense of this rushing is. You will not find 40 players fast.
---
Not hating, I experienced it myself - I tried private servers in the past. When I started playing there, I immediately noticed all kinds of things that were off. Granted they fixed a couple of them over time, but also, I got used to many others and this was the point when my memory of retail vanilla started to become blurry. 
---
Besides, there are all kinds of private servers, some of them being wildly inaccurate. Sure, you can compare purely client-side things very accurately. But everything that requires interaction with the server - mob paths, combat stats &amp; behaviour, or simple things like how often it rains in some zone are random guesses.
---
use search function on this reddit :)
---
yuo will see this question asked about 100 times, and with 100 times the same awnser :)
---
Cheers
---
i cracked a token and opted in to the classic beta i think thats it
---
i played actual vanilla so fingers crossed
---
Beta feedback is a numbers game and most of it is back-end stuff anyways. The idea that they're getting the "wrong" or "right" people in doesn't really matter for the big picture. The beta will eventually have thousands of people playing and that one issue that the super competent tester would spot easily will be spotted and reported by 10 semi-competent testers purely because of the number of testers. 
---
These first few weeks as they are scaling up the player base are primarily about making sure the back-end tech works and figuring out procedures etc, and to that point they just want active players. Player feedback is in there largely because "why not kill two birds with one stone".
---
Do you get an email as well?
---
Haha I agree OP, Asmond‚Äôs 20-30 warrior levelling will leave him fairly bored and frustrated I would bet. It seems like the novelty could already be wearing off for him.
---
I think I‚Äôm going to go a support class for classic, hunter or paladin or warlock. Something that the raid needs to make others better without needing to smash top top dps
---
&gt;Perform a service
---
Court jester is a service guys, you heard it here first.
---
The soundtracks are nice but it's not like they haven't been there for all those years
---
As I have heard
---
Biggest thing ever is a stretch, everything will come to an end, just s matter of time.
---
nah it fun watching all you people get a hard on for hating one guy and its funyy as hell lol
---
Thanks OP it's all clear now
---
If you make tons of videos talking about how great vanilla was, what great memories you have and present yourself as an expert I think you ought to have actually played vanilla.
---
^ posts facts, gets downvoted.
---
Good old wow community
---
Embrace the nerd
---
Maybe you can buy it somewhere else. It is available other places too. Amazon for example. I got mine at a online store for games/electronics in my country.
---
Speed levelers miss out on a lot of the things that makes vanilla good. You are going to spend a long time as level 60, if you use one or two more days reaching it, it will not affect you at the end game in any negative way.
---
I share a similar life story to yours, both in teens and today.
---
All I can say is, if you're passionate enough about something to share with people you know going in are not interested in them, you need to be ready for all kinds of response.
---
Side question tho, it sounds it's related to weight but what is "21 stone"?
---
Met my ex in wow. Back then I had no idea we would spend the next 6 years together. She travelled to the other side of the continent to come live with me.
---
Looking at the burnout of twitch streamerinios counteracts your point significantly 
---
also boredom
---
But the layout of the zones was only that way because they planned to introduce flying.
---
Other people have pointed out that they wouldn't need to change the outlands that significantly to make it so that players don't need flying mounts.
---
I tell you what I am going to do:
---
I will level 2 characters. A mage and maybe a priest or warrior (currently I am not sure. depends on how many heals are actually played).
---
The mage will be for solo leveling. He will have enchantment and tailoring. Both will be leveled beside questing. I will enjoy playing the level phase until I reach level 60. After reaching level 60 I will try to get t0.5 (if it is out) and try to find a MC guild.
---
The other character will be played whenever my wife want's to join me playing. If we play I will show her a lot of things, secret places, share memories, tell her where I met a few friends of ours. 
---
I will take my time. Because what wow is and always was for me: A journey. An adventure.
---
lol nah it's thunderfury.  was around in vanilla, just really fucking hard to get.
---
Shroud played wow quite a lot before, and he's been branching out to other games like ESO lately and seemingly enjoying it. Just because your favourite player didn't get an invite, doesn't mean it's a bad thing. He'll also bring a lot of attention considering he's one of the (if not the) biggest twitch streamer right now.

It was that way in TBC too, I remember the nuisance of switching to my tank set on my pally and having to heal myself back up to full.
---
what the loot table like for devilsaurs? there is that super elite boss too right?
---
it being visible is a bug, as other people have said it was a system message that would normally be hidden.
---
You already get a huge gold advantage by being the first 60s farming devilsaurs under normal circumstances. 2-3x that advantage is just clunky.
---
I'm just really fucking salty because september marks my LAST YEAR as a student (so probably the hardest) and I even managed to have a summer job that ended just at the start of august in order to have time for classic... Guess i'll have classic week instead of Summer, gotta have to try even harder !
---
&gt;So you can be bad and still kill bosses, that really does sound hard.
---
Is this some kind of potato logic or? Its like if you (who thinks classic is hard) went around saying wow classic is easy, i can kill it all on my lvl 120 no problem.
---
&gt;So hypothetically, if no one had killed Jaina and method went and got wf today, that would count for less than the wf they actually got?
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
If the boss was tuned the way it is now, and the world first was today, then the boss would have released today and people would be extremely annoyed that it was incredibly undertuned and not an acceptable difficulty.
---
Theoretically, then Method wouldn't have a chance to get the kill because US goes live first. And US would have cleared it before it even released in EU. So tyeah he boss probably wouldn't be viewed as of much worth.
---
But this is some next level off topic sperging.
---
&gt;My point is that you're not forced into turret mode while playing in retail, every class literally have the option to correct their position without it costing their performance.
---
If you're trying to say you are in classic that makes no sense. At its very base nature the encounter designs force FAR more movement / dodging / other mechanics etc on live that you HAVE to have some kinda of mobility these days. 
---
Another obvious aside is that anyone expected to do heavy movement f.e - the ranged tank on Cabal is expected to do far less damage than any other dps of their spec simply because they are forced to move more.  
---
In classic you have far more down time / less mechanics / more time to react. At its base nature most classes still rely on hard casting channelled abilities on retail too.
---
&gt;Now who's strawmanning, i never said anything about constant movement.
---
Ok, if the encounter is forcing movement then it is literally impossible to "perform to their maximum".
---
There isn't a single class in the game that isn't affected by needing to move in live wow. And every raid encounter forces movement to some extent.
---
There are plenty of cases in current wow where you simply dont take X/Y class or really dont want to simply because an encounter would force too much movement and it just becomes such a huge dps loss / pain to deal with a mechanic. For example, consider melee on Mythrax mythic and the orbs.
---
Joanas better
---
If traveling and good food keeps you happy then great. No arguing that money can/does provide all the things that could make you happy. Just stating I don't believe having millions in the bank and still being sad stems from lack of perspective.
---
They had to do that recently with Dota 2 and the sudden rise of Dota Auto Chess. Took them at least four months though.
---
If you want to be competitive IMO retail is the much better game in that sole aspect. Less time requirement and way more depth and competition(mythic + for 5 mans, and 20 man raids or arena‚Äôs for 2v2/3v3 or rates BGs for 10+ people.) 
---
Classic is amazing, but it‚Äôs much more of RPG where the fun is in leveling, and more casual type dungeons and PVP, but the rub is to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù you really have to put in a tremendous amount of hours in PVP st least, and the PVE just isn‚Äôt as competence as retail due to old content that has already been done and a lack of class depth.
---
Yes please put as many e-celebrities as possible onto a small number of realms so the rest of us can avoid them.
---
/join world
---
If enough players think to do it then it becomes a custom channel that is full of activity. That's what i remember from playing private servers
---
The beta is way undertuned. Aggro range too short, mob damage too low, hit rate too high, regen rate too high.
---
you wot?
---
15 BUCKS
---
LITTLE MAN
---
PUT THAT SHIT
---
IN MY HAND
---
No, just no, you are against it just because you don't like it, not for anything logical.
---
Ironically, flying was the real "you think you do, but you don't"
---
No there are just gonna be a few extra layers.
---
I'll take it slow when I'm leveling my 3rd character.
---
Everyone went into classic wow as a new player. So it‚Äôs ideal for that. Expansions like BFA are designed for a hardcore veteran audience. A first time player is much better off going into classic. Don‚Äôt let minmaxing talk on this sub scare you; most people will play like noobs anyway.
---
I'm a min/max person all the way! Minimize the number of douche-nozzles in my life; maximize the amount of fun I have.
---
I‚Äôm ok with this, I like arranging my characters based on level etc. This is fine.
---
Probably not. You will probably have login queues and an option for free server transfer to another server with lower population. This is how they did it originally and probably how they will do it now, if they stick to what they have said.
---
Me and my guild. :D I created the guild especially with a "no rush, no guides" mentality in mind.
---
There are 91000 people subbed now. Only very few post or even comment. I'm sure a lot of people just want to play casually and enjoy themselves.
---
Ooooh ok cool :)
---
Will classic have updates that are different to retail?
---
Oh wow nice!
---
Gimme pretty darn close and a great "closed" community and I'll be happy, happy, happy.
---
The classic not even released and you already want to discuss a post-classic future?! How about No.
---
It takes way less effort to google this widely available information than making a post on Reddit, just saying.
---
&gt;Also, it would be really good to see how its viewership and notoriety stacks up next to Retail
---
Blizzard does not want that though, and I imagine would prefer if Twitch kept WoW as one category. It makes retail appear better to an unknowing observer.
---
Similarly, if Blizzard ever releases subscriber data again, they aren't going to separate Classic only players from people who also own BfA. They'd just use one big number to make it appear as though BfA is in a great place.
---
u did not get the purpose of layering
---
 I'm looking for South African players who are planning to join for classic.
---
What realm are you gonna play on (when they are announced.)? maybe we can all join the same realm? Create a guild?
---
Would just be really fun to play with SAffers. Get RL beers n shizz for the hype. I feel like i'm alone on this continent with no one to talk to about classic. Maybe reddit can help?
---
&gt; Why people think that layering will be only for few weeks?
---
I am a skeptic myself but this time Blizzard and Ion was very clear. He even used the word PROMISE that its only for a few weeks in Phase 1.
---
Advertising and marketing is definitely a service
---
Now we just have to wait for retail players to complain about only seeing classic streams then :D
---
&gt; and it should be preserved because it affects gameplay
---
Frontstabbing was nigh impossible in real vanilla, hence it should not be possible in Classic.
---
I got invited, day 1 player (november 23 2004) collectors edition account, was actively subbed. I'm surrounded by streamers and wow e celebs on the horde guild lol. Zubdub
---
This is exactly why I think this sub i needed! (:
---
I actually dont care, you shouldnt too, why to burnout early, when there will be wipe anyways
---
&gt; I got invited, day 1 player (november 23 2004) collectors edition account, was actively subbed. I'm surrounded by streamers and wow e celebs on the horde guild lol. Zubdub, orc warrior
---
I‚Äôm a negative fellow
---
I would expect the wolf to do more damage.. am I mistaken?
---
Would love to see the longterm difference in viewership between classic and retail
---
yeah, *you* won't
---
serious guild already have
---
there are full rosters of min/maxed raiders steamrolling through endgame raids in preparation for august as we speak
---
Only possible if they still live in moms basement after all these years. (They do)
---
&gt;All respect to osrs but wow has a much higher standard
---
How so? More like different standards.
---
Comparing WoW (retail or classic) to OSRS is not a fair comparison, they're completely different games. Nothing is directly comparable: combat, questing, crafting and so on.
---
Fact is, OSRS original content today is loyal to its community, mostly because they only implement stuff the community votes on and, imo, it could potentially work for WoW Classic in the future.
---
Once you get your foot in the door (a change) further ones are made easier. Idk what you don't understand
---
Not to mention people who want to hate on people without streamers. They would be nothing without you.
---
Nothing!
---
Bridges,portals whatever. Wouldn't be difficult to add.
---
no ty, play retail
---
this post looks like a "ANYONE WATCHING IN 2019?????"" youtube comment in disguise
---
Warrior: no impact.
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
More seriously, longer pexxing time but not that much as drinking and regen is not as big as we think (traveling time is huge)
---
yes, but most of it is not plate like the show lets on, i believe that the shoulders are tier 0.5 leather and some of it is mail, so you wouldnt really want that as a pally/warrior (his shield)
---

---
There is a reason to get negative people into beta-testing positions. Those people will give harsh critisism over the hyped up super classic fans that had to get tissues when the soundtrack kicked in.
---
I definitely remember it that way as well.
---
are you drunk or smoked something ? this stuff is 15 years old, there are 50 leveling guides out there, 5000 videoguides, you can go on any private server and prepare yourself if you want to figure out how you wanna level ... the retardlevel and saltyness because like 5% of the playerbase getting Beta access and the other 95% are acting like little crybabys
---
You've watched every single stream?
---
whats wrong with playing wow in my bed when im sick?
---
This. If you wanna be technical about it, some mana heavy classes will notice this earlier (mages at around 10-ish?) while others will notice a bit later (hunters for example)
---
If you're dying 15 times before level 10 you need to hand in your 'best in the world' card.
---
Not sure what you mean, retail is the current version that includes the 7 previous expansions, where classic is solely the original 1-60 version. 
---
There is eventually a possibility of ‚Äònew‚Äô classic content, but it would be years down the line.
---
You can do that? Either you trust wireless peripherals, have a tiny laptop or your bed is interestingly positioned. 
---
The problem is you can be tracked by access to that activity when you just want to be a lazy fuck for a day
---
I watch TV knowing I‚Äôm seeing an advert every few minutes. Outside of those ad spots I am consuming content I enjoy.  GoT isn‚Äôt trying to get me to visit somewhere or buy something. The main goal is to keep me enjoying the show so I sit through the ad spots and earn the network money to pay back the outlay to buy or produce the show. These shows don‚Äôt beg me to pay them anything additional. (Show me a major stream that isn‚Äôt covered in animations for subs and donations.)
---
However if I watch a stream with this same mentality (as you obviously do to make the TV comparison) I‚Äôm still seeing an advert every few minutes just like TV, HOWEVER I‚Äôm also watching one long Blizzard commercial for WOW. Especially when that streamer has been personally invited to their HQ to create content or received a Beta key. 
---
Now I am watching this potentially never ending commercial and to make it worse I‚Äôm being encouraged to paying additional money (on top of the percentage of ad media the streamer takes) as a thank you for someone showing me the advert!!
---
TLDR: TV network pays to create a show which is (99% of the time) paid for + profit from ad revenue. 
---
Streamer outlays nothing and receives ad revenue which is all profit + subscription which is all profit + donations which is all profit PLUS Blizzard gets millions of free ad impressions for barely any investment vs TV with less guaranteed impressions and a huge cost. 
---
If Blizzard is my client and I am advertising the new expansion I invest 90% of media in twitch and YouTube targeted to users already watching my games being streamed. It‚Äôs ad within ads within ads!!
---
Then they also need to get their PC setup from back then if one wants to be so nitpicky. They also need to forget everything they know about the game and the knowledge in gaming in general since 2004. Certain things are understandable like the font on damage numbers but being able to rearrange a character in the character select screen does what exactly?
---
Don't know if you are a scumbag or the reason micro transactions exist
---
I approve.
---
30 is packed? With 500 just group up for things, skip quests and go grinding mobs.
---
lol....
---
Same
---
Man, I loved being a druid. 
---
Yeah, I think the rank 10 pvp gear is good hybrid gear.
---
It also has a great set bonus (faster movement in forms). I remember being heartbroken when I finally had to break up that set bonus, a few levels into TBC.
---
There's some overlap between your sets (I would wear healing rings and trinkets and stuff while pvping; the pvp leathers are decent for tanking; etc)
---
I wrote a program that uses a genetic algorithm to try to pick gear (yeah, I know...). Like any computer program, the quality of the output depends a lot on what assumptions and goals (and bugs) I have put in there ... but it likes the pvp gear too. So that's something.
---
If you want to tank, I think the most important thing is to get some items that give armor in weird slots (ring of protection, mark of tyranny, unyielding maul ... I would go enchanting to get smoking heart of the mountain. ideally horde for thrall's resolve.) I think you could wear those plus the pvp gear and be in good shape. (Also keep an eye out for leather pieces with unusually high armor - e.g. the slaghide gauntlets. Eventually maybe the AB/WSG rep gear.)
---
Here's some output from the program, for whatever that's worth. (you can go up to the /output/ directory to see other combinations).
---

---
Good luck mate.
---
&gt;If you like competitive and hard, you'd be better off on retail for both PVP
---
Nah.
---
&gt; If the boss was tuned the way it is now, and the world first was today, then the boss would have released today and people would be extremely annoyed that it was incredibly undertuned and not an acceptable difficulty.
---
No, I'm asking if it hadn't been tuned at all or maybe tuned harder at the start and gradually nerfed till how it was really released, and it just took this long to kill it.
---
&gt; If you're trying to say you are in classic that makes no sense. At its very base nature the encounter designs force FAR more movement / dodging / other mechanics etc on live that you HAVE to have some kinda of mobility these days.
---
You're missing the point that having that ability to move also serves as a buffer for mistakes, it doesn't matter that i positioned myself 30 yards in the wrong direction, because in the minute it takes me before it would matter i'm not at the correct location I've had enough instant casts to be able to move there.
---
And even forcing everyone to perform at 0% of their optimal for a period of time does not in itself make a boss harder, would a boss that freezes time for 30 seconds every minute be harder than if he didn't do that? No, he wouldn't.
---
&gt; There are plenty of cases in current wow where you simply dont take X/Y class or really dont want to simply because an encounter would force too much movement
---
Which has nothing to do with the difficulty of the game and everything to do with balance.
---
From the one or two streams I saw I couldn‚Äôt tell, but does the cursor change into a question mark or exclamation point when you hover over a question giver?
---
I might be completely off here, but isn't Spirit of Redemption really good in BGs? Of course the goal is to not die at all but it's going to happen sooner or later, especially is solo queues, so isn't *10 seconds* of unlimited flash heal spam really good for just 1 talent? Also considering how it's often better to die and respawn with full health/mana instead of spending upwards of a minute for drinking. 
---
Also, is 5/5 Spiritual Guidance really worth it considering the PvP gear has literally 0 spirit? Wouldn't those talents be better off spent in talents such as Improved Inner Fire, Inspiration, or Spell Warding?
---
The sub is much more receptive to this sort of content during news/activity droughts
---

---
Just because you don't like it as much doesn't make it not true.
---
I hate current WoW PvP. But it is objectively much more competitive if you actually want to push high end arena.
---
On the PVE front there's not really any talk to be had.
---
What makes u think only streamers will abuse it the most? Where did they hurt u?
---
Ian, is that you?
---
Joana/furious Paul gets quite a few viewers just for running a shit quality YouTube video from 14 years ago. Imagine if he would actually play the game
---
&gt;People would KILL to play this game again for the first time.
---
WHO DID YOU TALK TO? WAS IT BRIAN?! FUCKING BRIAN! Wait, what are we talking about? I don't know.
---
Guys... the layering will be there only for launch, like the 3 first weeks... your example with Kazzak will not work. Devilsaurs maybe... but that‚Äôs all
---
Back in vanilla closed beta, cap was at 30 for the first month and a half, then 40 for 3 weeks, then 50 then 55 then 60.
---
I'd expect Blizzard to have the same approach here, even though duration of stages will obviously be constrained
---
I didn't do raids or anything, but we did a lot of dungeons with a bear tank. My wife and I used to duo a bunch of dungeon bosses with a druid and a rogue, actually.
---
I waited a decade for Classic, no regrets.
---
I wouldn't mind a server that had two big streamers on opposing factions. The only thing I actually hate about streamer servers is it brings a massive faction imbalance because everyone wants to be on the streamers faction of choice.
---
&gt; In the end of year December phase 2 will roll out
---
They said phases will roll out "organically", meaning once current content has been done next phase will come.
---
Despite being a member of the #nochanges party myself, I don't see why we can't discuss about future, post phase 6 content, as long as it doesn't break the core philosophy. I approve.
---
Layer is actually PER continent. So you can have 5-6k pop server with everyone no extra layering going on. So the pic is wrong in that regard.
---
Bg premades is your friend my friend, any afk gets kicked by premade leader, ez
---
BIG TRUE ASMON
---
Lol 
---
imagine joining the streamers server just to walk around him and sniff his butthole, only to be in a completely different layer lol
---
Bullshit. When pulling 2 mobs instead of 1 nets you certain death, that's difficulty. It's not complicated, but it is punishing and that is a form of difficulty (see dark souls). And while it is certainly slower than love wow, it's hardly objectively slow. It's still real time and you can feel it when kiting is part of your rotation.
---
Its kind of hilarious though.
---
I got a heroes of the storm beta invite and I didn't even want it so it went to waste.
---
Probably not going to help my case with getting into the classic one..
---
But at least there's less danger of us burning out on a beta?
---
What‚Äôs ur stream?
---
We have countless of vanilla videos and people that actually played in 2005 as reference.
---
Well i think i try min/max as much as i can without stressing it too much. It will be kinda situational. When playing solo i can try to be more effective, with friends i don't let min maxing to be the deciding factor how we play &amp; what we do. Having fun is the prio 1.
---
Then go play Alliance? They have pretty elves over there.
---
So far from watching the streams it doesn‚Äôt look very much like a test server. There‚Äôs none of the normal debug menus on display, from the looks of it this is just a badly timed PR move to build hype, badly timed because 3 months is more than enough time to drove a wedge between your prospective audience and the personalities blizzard is employing to build hype.
---
Stone is the common measurement of weight in the UK, Its the equivalent of about 294 pounds.
---
i got an invite and im not a content creator, just a day 1 player
---
It‚Äôs just for phase 1. If it‚Äôs a high pop server then you‚Äôll see a lot of people
---
How were you in your 30s in 2005 and 15 years later you‚Äôre only in your 40s?
---
This. Though many of these, who've only experienced private servers, will be slightly off in their expectations as far as leveling time is concerned. But expect around 3 to 4 guilds per faction per server to start MC on day 5/6. Remember that you don't need to be 60 to enter, just to be attuned and that can be done at 55. Not do you need 40 people, 30ish is fine
---
thats not really true. i am in the &lt;HOME&gt; guild on horde side and everyone including the streamers have been pretty intent on finding and reporting bugs
---
Agreeeed but I‚Äôm Certain we will have one :)
---
As a twat i approve this message.
---
If you're not playing on a 1024x768 CRT monitor, using Windows XP service pack 1 on an Intel Pentium 3 you should honestly just fucking strap yourself and your entire family to a rocket and launch yourself into the sun because you're not a true vanilla gamer like me and don't deserve to be in the beta.
---
Of course classic streams will be higher. Blizzard knows they will. They also know that views will die down after that until the next retail release at with point live will regain the lead. People are acting like the bump in viewers is nothing to do with the novelty and won't die down after classic is released
---
Most were already subbed anyway, but if they have a big enough stream I'm sure Blizzard would send them a beta invite anyway. It just makes sense from a business stand point.
---
Err isn't this thread only for ppl actually inside the beta?
---
Already seing 3 people report the same bug they've seem on asmongolds stream..
---
&gt;Blizz should either give a 15-30 minute layer-swapping debuff where you can't interact with NPCs/objects and deal no damage but still take damage (or perhaps a Resurrection Sickness-like debuff).

This would absolutely destroy people trying to play with friends. The whole point of layer swapping even being a thing is so you don't get locked away from your friends. And if you make the duration so small that it is acceptable for friends trying to play together, then it is also so low you can still abuse it.
---
&gt;Or a hefty cooldown (2-4 hrs) on how often you can swap layers
---
This would be better, but it still means you can swap for rares and away from ganking. Only being able to do it, for example once per hour, is not that big of a deal. You need quite a long cooldown for it to work, but then you run into problem with friends again. People having to stay logged in while they eat and things like that, because otherwise they can't play together with their friends for the rest of the night.
---
I do fully agree with your concerns, though. People will abuse if it is possible and it is certainly something that would ruin a lot of my experience, especially because I plan to play on a PvP server and want that ganking experience when I level. I want to feel the war between factions from day one (or whenever I get to a level where I meet the other faction).
---
Those darn moths.
---
Every idea needs a home. Hopefully this becomes somewhere we can redirect questions towards.
---
I never once said Mythic raiding was easy. But WoW as it is now, makes it easier for players to get gear. Sure, the top guilds are the ones doing the top raids, that was the same in vanilla. Despite what you read on here, when tBC was released, very few guilds were actually in Naxx and killing Kel'Thuzad.  
---
I like that Bliz are looking for Vanilla player with active subs for the Vanilla Beta. Its these players who have been asking for Classic for years. 
---
Its easier to level, get gold, get gear, raise a new alt, go raid, go instance, look for group, look for raid, change everything about your character in Retail....than it was in vanilla and will be in classic. 
---
This is what I am looking forward to as a player who played vanilla from release.  I've no idea why current retail players who've never played Classic, can be that up in arms about not being invited to the beta of a game they never played.
---
Exactly my thought as well!
---
You just proved his point.
---
If you had a boring 9-5, you might find yourself missing the excitement.
---
The grass always seems greener..
---
ahah good find it proves it :D
---
Most of warrior pre bis is mail and leather
---
Hopefully then! I‚Äôve grown so accustomed to world chat that it would feel weird without it lol
---
I‚Äôm confused how people can claim bugs in regen, damage etc. Blizzard literally ported the 1.12 database so it contains EXACTLY the same values as the original game at that stage. 
---
Obviously bugs can exist related to the code, but probably not related to data such as spell damage, HP regeneration etc. 
---
I‚Äôm sure most people that complain about those things judge it based on their private server experience where all these values were made up.
---
Best feature about wow. Guilds will clear old raids looking for certain rare drops for core raiders and are willing to let (newer to the build) alternate raiders gear up with the "scraps."
---
This could allow you to catch up and be relatively geared but you wouldn't have as much DKP as the core raiders who had been with the guild all along.
---
I love this
---
Ye man, Classic is about the journey, well for a fair share of it. I will be taking my time as I never got to experience Vanilla,
---
At first i also thought about trying to level as fast as possible, but the more i think about it the more i realize that i dont want to do that. I want to enjoy the journey. Going to dungeons, doing quests and so on. It is not a race people. Just enjoy your time.
---
on one hand they say, fuck the mounts coz the casuals might feel tempted to rush through content for a cool reward at 60. but then they are saying, if you reach 60 in the first 2 weeks you will have several layers to farm off, making it even more profitable to rush to 60.
---
Just walk to Stormwind. Intentionally die because you'll move much faster in Wisp form. Then resurrect in your friends starting zone.
---
Exactly
---
They have phones with SSDs 15 times faster than their HDDs in their gaming PCs :/
---
I dont think its any harder. It just takes longer. Players will adapt and learn what they can/cant do without heirlooms and having to rely on quest items and crafted gear. 
---
I am excited that even 2-3 maybe even 4yrs down the line, there will still be many players playing classic, and working on gear progression with the level cap still at 60. Cant wait :D
---
&gt;No, I'm asking if it hadn't been tuned at all or maybe tuned harder at the start and gradually nerfed till how it was really released, and it just took this long to kill it.
---
I'm not sure what point you are trying to make then. If the boss was tuned to the point where it was literally impossible (this actually HAS happened before) and the nerfed and a guild is finally able to kill it that is not the same as your guild being awful and playing their classes like shit and just waiting for bosses to get nerfed and your ilvl to go up so you can eventually kill the boss.
---
&gt;You're missing the point that having that ability to move also serves as a buffer for mistakes, it doesn't matter that i positioned myself 30 yards in the wrong direction, because in the minute it takes me before it would matter i'm not at the correct location I've had enough instant casts to be able to move there.
---
That's a snuck premise if I've ever seen one.
---
On live if you're 30 yards in the wrong direction then you will still either A. lose dps / healing moving or B. Most likely just die. Most mechanics of note aren't that forgiving.
---
Honestly, the way you talk just seems like you honestly have no clue how the classes work, nor any concept of what an actual high level of efficiency is. Note that your original comment was that classes can "perform to their maximum" even if they have to move. Which just isn't true at all.
---
&gt;And even forcing everyone to perform at 0% of their optimal for a period of time does not in itself make a boss harder, would a boss that freezes time for 30 seconds every minute be harder than if he didn't do that? No, he wouldn't.
---
Is there a point you are trying to make, or are you just throwing random scenarios with no actual worth out there? 
---
&gt;Which has nothing to do with the difficulty of the game and everything to do with balance.
---
You seem confused. That isn't "balance" that is BECAUSE these classes CANT operate at "maximum" (your word) whilst having to perform the mechanics which require MOVEMENT.
---
Mythrax is literally a perfect example of this.
---
These classes are otherwise perfectly valid, and may be the number 1 choice on other fights or mechanics that dont require this movement.
---
If you can't understand that concept then this is quite pointless.
---
Hence, your original statement is - as I've show in multiple ways now - utter bs.
---
Welp...
---
Wooosh
---
tier 0.5 is level 60, idk any plate wearing class at 60 wearing leather lol
---
Nice, gonna upgrade my static wallpaper to this when i get home +1
---
Im more worried layering messing with resource scarcity, like Black Lotus / Ghost mushroom spawns being higher then usual.
---
The other problem i see is lvling ab alt who gets ganked, logging over to the main character only to find out you can‚Äôt do shit because Main and Alts are on different layers..
---
Has the potential to mess with world PvP a lot, which was half the beauty of Vanilla‚Äôs open world. How can I stalk people across both factions and gank..
---
I had to check who the f she is. Seen her twitter posting selfies made with the "gender swap app" trend thingy, but I think genetics set her for life with the male filter. I'm just saying...
---
Why should he get rewarded for dropping $700 on stuff that has no indication to help him get in beta? That would be rewarding stupidity.
---
The battle chest doesn't exist anymore, with just a sub you will have all xpacs except the latest one.
---
When Classic is out, the sub (and sub alone) will let you play both versions.
---
You need to buy BFA only if you want to play BFA content, up to Legion it's just the sub.
---
nice name
---
Flying is one of the big reasons that killed the game what are you talking about.
---
I'm already taking my vacation June 10th and I will be FUCKED if I'm changing it now. God damn do I need that vacation.
---
I might have an "appointment" that I need to book a day off for on Aug 27th though.

Undead warlock
---
&gt;layering will hopefully be there only for a short time, a time where everyone is still leveling
---
From a PvE server perspective this might be fine, but many people want the STVietnam experience. Personally I'm most hyped about leveling through all my old favourite zones while fighting the other faction. I enjoy the hunting through a whole zone (or running away). I'd say it is a valid concern that with nothing to counter swapping abuse many people will just abuse it to get to safety.
---
This is my only concern, really. Okay, some people might abuse for some extra nodes or stuff, but in the long run that won't have much consequences. I understand why some people might dislike this if they are really into the economy game early on, but I'd say that is a minority compared to how many want the PvP experience.
---
The system is overall quite clever. The healthy population issue is real and can potentially hurt a realm a lot, so I'm all in for layering, just hope they try to make it hard to abuse.
---
I dont get why ppl think that layering absolutely means spawns of rare things like devilsaur, black rotus etc will get multiplied too. They can limit the spawns to exactly the same number as 1 layers would result. Just add a check that it will pick on WHAT layer the normal spawn happens.
---
That's the world of Warcraft that you play! üéâüé∂
---
&gt;my question is it ok for someone who never played wow to play this? 
---
You are strictly forbidden from playing the game. 
---
Jk man you'll be fine, leveling from 1-60 you'll get pretty familiar with your class so a lack of prior experience isnt too much of a hindrance. You'll make mistakes and do noob shit, but that's the real vanilla experience. Consider yourself lucky.
---
Nice strawman.
---
I honestly feel like if people are upset about this, ur a fucking loser. I get the whole no changes but really??
---
This just goes to Show how People that are super reasonable usually can turn into a big flock of sheeps just repeating what the first one said...
---
I¬¥m totally with you on that one! Although I would love a beta key - I¬¥m at least glad I can watch streamers Play the game :)
---
Wasn't clear in the post but that's what I meant with "consistently higher after classic release". 
---
It will be interesting to see their reactions if this is still the case months after release.
---
Have you ever watched tipsout, if you have, you know the answer to your question.
---
&gt; force        
---
Thank the lord, now my level 37 hunter won't be at the top of the list when I decide that I don't actually want to play hunter
---
35 and watching
---
The chart being split in 3 is just for illustration purposes.
---
In reality, most likely 90% of those who will create a char in Classic wow will not level it to 60.
---
Population will not die down after phase 1 ends, it will die down in the first month. Only those commited to the game will remain interested.
---
They have already hinted they will be making us "stick" to layers but everyone is too busy assuming they know how the new system works before we even see a stress test to experience it in action.
---
I can't say for certain whether it is actually incorrect, but comparing a warrior to a warlock isn't a very fair comparison. Take a look at this WoWWiki article from 2006:
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060901221803/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas%3AHealth_Regen
---
Melee classes get much more of a boon from spirit to offset their lack of native healing. Case in point, Warriors get ~11x more benefit from Spirit than Warlocks do. Perhaps that is what is causing the difference here?
---
I'd say more like 90% of those who create chars in Classic wow will quit soon after.
---
Honestly, why not just restrict layer swapping to capital cities? You can play with your friends but it can't be abuse to run away from gankers and it removes the efficiency of swapping for nodes, rare mobs etc.
---
If this is too strict, add it to the major quest hubs as well, since in general once you are inside a quest hub you are generally safe anyway (might have impact on things like low level quest hub raiding like Lakeshire being taken by the Horde, though).
---
i miss classic¬†paladins ;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;
---
Spirit of redemption is great. I only don't take it in this video because these were all pugs, not premades, so not worth to me. I normally would just take one point from guidance and put it in there.
---
Also 5/5 guidance is not worth if you have full PvP gear but I don't have that. I do have 4/6 for the set bonus, but stack spirit on all of my off set pieces plus 3/8 tier 2. If i find myself lacking in spirit I also swap to just 2/6 pvp for the stam bonus and fill the rest up with spirit.
---
Koreans my dude.
---
Lmao what‚Äôs 33 + 15
---
i dont have a active sub so im not getting in :(
---
You decide. Play it official or not. Also the classic team is awesome and I think although it's not a direct way to support they deserve the success
---
31 + 15 = 46
---
i just looked i still have the Demo installed from Blizzcon
---
I absolutely love that this is in. I always hated knowing that, if I switched main characters, my new main wouldn‚Äôt be at the top. I remember dealing with this for most of vanilla (switched from hunter to warrior around when AQ was about to be launched).
---
Pretty sure thats how it used to be.
---
The original beta ended with a level cap of 50, the original live patch notes quite prominently points out you can now level up to level 60.
---
Cause people take private servers as being fully correct when they're not

---
if they would do that it would be almost impossible to keep up with herbing/mining while leveling.
---
I haven't bought anything from those companies in literally years, it's not hard to boycott those ones.
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs just an assumption right now. It could be random for all we know.
---
You're saying like its bad those streamers exist. Both type of people are needed, it's not mutually exclusive.
---
Priests healing is a million times better than resto shaman. You simply pop LIP if they open on you and spam mana burn the shaman. And yes I'm current glad on shaman but also play on a premade server with all of the best vanilla players like stormx, ohgee, perplexity, tranqenrage, greatwizard, cadet, sodapoppin, monkeynews, etc. I have literally never seen a single resto shaman brought to a premade
---
5th gen i5, gtx 980.
---
that's how you get hours of entertainment out of 1 mins worth of content
---
Calm down. We have no evidence to support these worst case scenarios everyone is already shitting their pants over. They said they have ways to make us stick to layers. How about we wait until we see a stress test and actually get an idea of how it works instead of assuming these half baked plans people came up with after 30 seconds of hearing a basic explanation of layers?
---
As somebody that played retail vanilla from day 1 and many Vanilla private servers, what makes you say this?  Recent Vanilla private servers are pretty damn close to how it was in retail vanilla. Over population being the biggest deviation in my opinion.
---
Count me in. I'll be a slow-paced altoholic.
---
We will have 3k+ pop per layer, but I suppose when the amount of players to be in the same time ine the same zone will reach a treshold chosen by Blizz (say 500 players), then they will create another layer (and so on).
---
We can also speculate (we have no confirmation on this, right?) that say the server is split in 3 layers, then after say 6 hours maybe 50% of the players go offline. We could speculate that means the server will dynamically put all the remaining online players on 2 layers (thus, remove the layer #3).
---
This makes much more sense, thank you!
---
As far as I know, Blizzard haven't sent out general invites yet. They've only invited selected people.
---
Got an email, but not til 11pm. Beta went live at 5:30ish
---
What could possibly go wrong with Blizzard controlling this 'great new idea'?
---
I'm excited as Vanilla was a game you could actually play casually, and hardcore, and still have moderate success doing either.
---
You have to realize that dying is just making you level slower. It doesn't cause you to fail to level. For something to be hard there needs to be a possibility for failure to achieve it.
---
I have heard it‚Äôs streamers/big people in the wow community and blizz employees
---
You can do that silently.
---
Um... no.
---
Your Mac should be able to play WoW classic, but due to it being almost 10 years old I doubt apple would even touch it so youd have to fiddle with it yourself.
---
probably the fov making it look as thought they were swimming faster
---
So, anyone trying to get into the beta should check their launcher. I, and others, never got an email about it and Classic just showed up there. Click on WOW in the launcher and then select Beta: WoW Classic in the Region/Account box.
---
No you're not understand
---
The guys will still control the leather
---
It will just add a dimension in no1 wants
---
If you use "our legal system works" as a means for justification to suggest we live in a good society then I got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.
---
Also consider the viewsonic and Acer models of the same specs. They all use literally the exact same panel from the same manufacturer. The ViewSonics tend to be a bit cheaper and look better imo. Plus the Acer and Asus have had QC issues in the past.
---
A 27" 144hz 1440p with an IPS display is an amazing gaming monitor if you can swing the price.
---
Ah that brings back memories
---
if you want to have the original feel of classic, no streaming is allowed or twitch/streamers influence
---
Quel'Danas
---
it took ages, seeing that shitshow rs3 instead of osrs was disappointing.
---
From the streamer's POV, that's what I've seen so far. I've seen some good players like Stormx get invited, so maybe they were also seeking out very skilled players to test.
---
&gt; ok so it's large scale sharding, I want to see 6000 people on at once in my vicinity not only 3000.... 
---
But that wouldn't be #nochanges if the original servers were capped at 2500-3000 /s
---
Joking aside, I think Layering sounds like one of the better solutions for handling the initial release. 
---
Of course it's not perfect, but it has to be better than massive queues in the beginning, or some servers dying after a while.
---
We know it would take time for Blizzard to sort out a dying realm without something like Layering in place.
---
:)
---
"I am a passive aggressive member of the #NOCHANGESREEEEE-club."
---
/u/Teeb , can you be kind enough to never post again and dont play classic? I assume I speak for the majority of us. Have a nice day
---
I think you are severely underestimating just how influential streamers are.
---
Are we sure they didn't get in? I and many others got in but never received an email telling us we did. The Beta just seems to show up under the Region/Account box in the launcher.
---
Solution: dont shard fkn classic
---
They're close but as blizzard &amp; the people who went to Irvine for the alpha have said, they're getting a lot of things wrong. Base health/mana regen and mob/boss armour/resistances being two of the noted ones already.
---
Also mob patrols if you've watched Staysafe's stream, mobs just don't wonder around on private servers like they did in vanilla.
---
The *data* about every aspect of the game is 100% original vanilla (patch 1.12).
---
They imported those data into a modern client so there will be bugs of course.
---
Haha that Thing is funny af :D
---
I will use that for something - I don¬¥t know when and for what - but I will! Trust me xD
---
:Yeah ‚Äúhorde players‚Äù always chasing for the best racials :)
---
What if you have different friends?
---
Well, perhaps that's why I take public transit or ride my bike and use a credit union and basically live "Zero Waste". And don't participate in the consumerist gangbang.
---
you know that wont happen
---
It is not that shaman healing is horrible. But you have to understand how terrible their mana regen is. The only way to keep up mana wise with a priest (they could never keep up with a paladin,) is to stack mp4, losing out on all other stats. And you have to think of all the mana you're using frost shocking, earth shocking (most shamans will.not use rank 1 earth shock,) and droppinf totems. Then casting lesser healing waves in to a warrior that has MS Debuff, you're ooming so quickly. A priest can inner focus and cover it with a noggenfogget to drop a high rank greater heal, and not have to heal for a while after that
---
I wont be min maxing at all if i do play.
---
some friend has to login first. the rest just follows
---
"While I dont mind changes, I tell people that I mind changes. #NOCHANGESREEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Yeah bud, we know. No one cares
---
Everyone needs to learn humor and remember what sub we‚Äôre on methinks.
---
&gt; I'm not sure what point you are trying to make then. If the boss was tuned to the point where it was literally impossible (this actually HAS happened before)
---
I know, I was there.
---
 &gt; and the nerfed and a guild is finally able to kill it that is not the same as your guild being awful and playing their classes like shit and just waiting for bosses to get nerfed and your ilvl to go up so you can eventually kill the boss.
---
So in reality it's not as much "when you kill it" as it is "when you kill it in relation to other guilds", at which point it's not really the boss you're competing against, it's the other guilds.
---
&gt; That's a snuck premise if I've ever seen one.
---
Either you don't know what that means or I'm genuinely curious curious at which premise I'm sneaking in.
---
&gt; Is there a point you are trying to make, or are you just throwing random scenarios with no actual worth out there?
---
Yes, the boss hp/damage is tuned around people being able to move during periods where movement is required, if no one could do anything during those periods, those numbers would be reduced and as such the only change in difficulty that comes as a result of everyone having instant casts/ability to cast while moving is a buffer for mistakes.
---
&gt; Hence, your original statement is - as I've show in multiple ways now - utter bs.
---
It's only utter bs to the point you're trying to straw man it, to the point you are where you claim being able to move and still do full d/hps is the same as being able to do so constantly.
---
#NOCHANGESREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Hello mate.
---
Her name is Karen.
---
Awe! we are 4 people planning to play, dont want to run a guild though. No time for that, but go ahead and add me on discord DrewZA#8993, Im not subbed at the moment so not on Bnet that much, perhaps we can just join an EU guild together
---
#NOCHANGESREEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
True but its the best solution. Or at the very least give the players a choice. Make some sharded servers and some non sharded servers. Ill wait in que to not have sharding and if blizz is right then my server will be dead and ill have to reroll anyways at no detriment to them.
---
It's a good thing they let the big streamers on first so then they would level up past the mass of people griefing them and ruining the beta. Let them have a few days then let everyone else in.
---
Loot crates are essentially the same thing as slot machines, children are experiencing being "in the zone" as gambling addicts call it.  So yes, there is in fact gambling in overwatch.
---
You fail to achieve leveling in a proper time.
---
"We swear, totally only for the first few weeks... just believe us!"
---
That makes no sense. If you have friends who don't know each other, they will be distributed among the various layers, so if you have friends in all layers, where will you be placed then?
---
&gt;if you reach 60 in the first 2 weeks
---
People will have to play like, 10 hours a day every day to reach 60 in 2 weeks (assuming you are efficient). So going back the the first comment, if they do that then they deserve the gold. If you play 10 hours a day you can easily be rich, one way or the other.
---
As long as they only keep it for a few weeks, a month top, then it is not going to be an issue. Remember you don't just need to get to 60 while layers are active, you also need to have some time to actually farm at 60 with them active. So if they stay for 4 weeks (I can't see it staying for longer than a month) you need to hit 60 it probably 3 weeks to get a meaningful profit. That is 7 hours a day to 60, again - assuming you are efficient enough to hit 60 with 6 days playtime. Most people will probably be 8 or more, which brings it to over 9 hours a day.
---
Overall, if someone are both good enough to hit 60 is a really short time played *and* dedicate so many hours to play each day, then I don't see the problem in them getting a lot of gold. That is such a small issue compared to making sure the overall health of the realm population will be good.
---
I was talking more about leveling, since I didn't do much raiding. Leveling in retail goes so fast compared to vanilla. I can play any class in retail and pull 3-4 mobs at the start of the game and never die. Whereas in classic if you pull two mobs, you probably gonna die. I don't wanna be rude but world PvP is a joke in retail, I got ganked 3 times in the first month playing. And I barely see anyone while questing. Did Felwood and have only seen one player during all my quests. And I was on a high pop server.
---
PvP is competitive on both WoW games.
---
I'm not bashing any of the two games. I like 'em both. But if I had to choose between them, I'd choose classic. It's a much more dangerous world and it takes time to get things done. I never felt accomplishment on retail. I do however in classic.
---
It's not like it's auto-sorting your characters for you, if you don't use the little arrows your classic experience will be safe.
---
You can like them silently
---
Never misunderstood. Sharding is sharding no matter what they call it.
---
I get the feeling that this beta will do more to kill classic than blizzard has been spending years denying the demand exists.
---
My good friend got a beta invite and isn't subbed. He's even able to play without the sub, I know that goes against what they told us but those are facts.
---
Ez dismount, enemycastbar, probably vuhdo since it will be on the new BFA client for raid frames, and some type of modui if it is released for classic. If not, a gryphon remover addon for the standard bars and a flexbar type addon to give me an extra action bar..too many keybinds.
---
No. There will be a wipe.
---
Stay on the road, run it in one shot.  
---
It's not hard, just a bit of time.
---
This dude is who I think of when I think wow leveling guides. Anyone who played in vanilla knows about Joana.
---
I guess this sub has been reduced to people posting bugs here instead of... You know, *reporting them to Blizzard*. Well, that and people yelling left and right about "this is different than I remember it, and my memory is perfect!" while somehow ignoring that Blizzard has the original data to work from.
---
Those are two different things. Joana has a speed leveling guide. Kargoz has a guide on how to level a certain class and has done that for all classes.
---
So both are really good!
---
He got burned out Day 1. Dude was streaming BFA after a few hours
---
If more than 10 people were in, probably.
---
There‚Äôs some kind of weird tipsout hateboner in this thread, just don‚Äôt worry about it. People are salty they didn‚Äôt get in
---
Phew. Ok, hope so. I'll just spend 3 months wondering what class I'll roll then lol.
---
I have a friend with a beta invite and he is not subbed, he is even able to play the beta without a sub. I know that goes against what they said but its true.
---
true, that will be a painful problem. I guess you could somewhat go around that with a facebook like "suggested friends" system where it groups together people with close connections. But this seems perhaps unreasonable. Guess we'll have to wait until the layering period is over
---
That's cool, don't get mad when the game gets launched as a buggy mess because they needed to get streamers in over actual meaningful testing.
---
The vanilla community pushing for this has long existed prior to streamers dude. Just because you and some other folks rely on some dude filming himself sitting at his PC to get your latest news doesn't mean shit to the rest of us honestly.
---
The only guys I see saying "without streamers this game wouldn't be on the way" are the ones who heard about it from a streamer.  The reality is YOU guys wouldn't know about the vanilla movement without them sure, but this community was huge and very vocal about a legacy server prior to these guys talking about it (to get paid I might add).
---
Do these guys bring in some new blood? Sure, thats obvious, but to claim they are the reason for Classic is absurd and a slap in the face to the classic community.
---
We don't use then logic here on the internet. Logic is for politicians and army men
---
awe. ye, i don't want to run a guild either. Ill add you later tonight.
---
I wish I could give you gold.
---
Loot boxes is gambling. It has the exact same mechanicals as a slot machine and has the same psychological effects on people as slot machines.

People are in fact getting addicted to the loot box gambling, experiencing what gambling addicts call "in the zone" which means getting a "high" from the possibility of a jackpot.  It's interesting because gambling addicts don't enjoy winnimg, they get pissed off when they won because it takes time away from them pulling the lever.  
---
The same thing has been showed with loot boxes.
---
Grats Drew! When did you receive the email, i'm asking because i'm courious if they are still sending them out, or if it's over for now and the rest of us have to wait un till our turn (if it comes) I cant seem to find any info on this
---
Don't wear name brand shoes or clothes? Don't shop at Amazon? Don't watch Netflix? Don't play any other video games?
---
Good for you!!
---
That is why I follow Slyvanas. Hearthing, omw
---
"big debate" You mean Some dude opening a thread, with 5 people agreeing with him and 1000 more downvoting it to oblivion? Anyway, what will this sub-reddit actually do? Do you ban people that oppose said changes? Or it will be constan't drama that pretty much shows why that should never be allowed.
---
Find a thread on the matter with at least 3 people agreeing on their different ideas of bonus content. Multiply this by 100 000.
---
Then remember that the people who made Vanilla WoW aren't here no more.
---
Agree    on changes, and ask the current team, that drove us to want Classic  in   the first place, to implement these changes without breaking the  game.
---
After this take a look at the company name: ACTIVISIONblizzard.
---
Good luck creating a "Vanilla+" game that wont turn into ToC/IC dungeons again, which will erase 80% of the content.
---
Or maybe you will approach the OSRS vote? Aka the Mob rule. Check this:

---
People    there can't agree and propose changes on potential TBC and WotLK    realms, and you want those people to vote for content? Good luck, with    not turning into BFA after 2 years.
---
"There    can be realms for everyone", yes except the question how will you not    split the community to a breaking point, remains. Maybe you want    eventual CRS again? Heard it's great for the sense of    community...(Cross-realm-sharding).
---
Private    servers kept people for over 10 years with simple fresh server    launches, but for some reason the official one will die. Go figure.
---
I    hope this time blizzard will be able to protect people from   themselves,  but after reading every singe thread on the subject and the   constant  drama of "this should be changed" which is countered ASAP by   "Lol no,  better change that instead", turning into drama in no time.   Good luck  with post content that wont screw up everything. This is   blizzard, and  they have multiple games, if you think that you will get   100% dedicated  team to make SURE that it will always feel "vanilla"   well good luck. It  will be even harder than working on Retail.
---
The    potential for disaster is big, and sometimes it's better to get a   fresh  server or come back later if you are burnt-out, than risking to   one day  come back to a game you have no idea WTF it turned in to.
---
It shouldn't be shitty, it's better to start with too few servers and add extra ones if there's the demand rather than have to merge dead ones.
---
That‚Äôs quite dark isn‚Äôt it? That means Blizzard is going to kill Vanilla (this time for real) and while doing it, killing itself.
---
Install Linux and Wine.
---
&gt;You're not going to get an unbiased answer from a subreddit of people who are literally foaming at the mouth for Classic WoW to release.
---
Stop being so ridiculous. Only the left side foam is for Classic to release, the right side foam stem from their hatred of retail.
---
In the end you will lose all beta progress anyway. The wierd thing is this isn't like a normal beta, we've all played this before. We all know what classes we'll make and what route we'll take for leveling. Missing out on the beta isn't actually that big a deal.
---
[Pets!](https://i.imgur.com/rYOowfN.jpg)
---
Its not..
---
Eh I know I was really looking forward to it being out earlier in the summer because then my fianc√©e could have played with me during leveling. She‚Äôs a teacher and summer is the only really extended vacation she has until Christmas.
---
Going to be rough leveling a warrior solo again, but we do what we must. Or multi box haha.
---
I‚Äôm mehgin &amp; I will not.
---
I honestly dont think that blizzard cares one bit about streamer exposure and already seing posts about "this streamer should get access" here is rather pretencious.
---
Streamers getting customers is a FRACTION of a drop in blizzards marketing and id 10x times rather have someone test the beta properly than someone just doing a stream for views. (not saying all streamers are like this ofc but just because youre a streamer shouldnt mean dips on beta accesses)
---
And hey, maybe its a good reason some of us dont try the beta cuz it could mean you getting tired of the game in its bugged state and i for one dont wanna ruin that first experience back to the vanilla world we all remember and love.
---
It depends.
---
If you never played WoW before just wait for Classic, it's a very different experience, better in many aspects.
---
If you played WoW before and have a high level char, you could play retail to farm gold you can use later to pay for the sub, no other reason than this unless you're actually interested in playing retail.
---
The only trick I know of is when you first step into the Wetlands from Loch Modan you can kill yourself and spirit res about halfway to Menethil. IIRC it‚Äôs when you‚Äôre through the first tunnel and up on the high pass, you just throw yourself off the cliff.
---
I realize this would be impossible, but i would love to see different servers for each expansion.  
---
\#1: Classic (will stay Classic forever but have the included patches)  
---
\#2: You play through Classic up through Burning Crusade (with all its patches)  
---
\#3: You play C+BC+WoTLK  
---
...and so on
---
Why?
---
Ur so nice, thx
---
You need to be subscribed for that and many people (myself included) aren‚Äôt subscribed and have no plans to do so. I can wait, but I can already feel that the big personality will get burned out when blizzard inadvertently reset character progression a month from now.
---
You rekt him so hard I won't even be triggered by your use of an emoticon on reddit.
---
I kneeeeeew it was coming :D
---
They are guessing it wont be needed by the end of phase 1 or earlier. GUESSING being the key word. I bet we can all guess whats gonna happen if the player dropoff isnt whats expected and we have have 4x the recommended player base on 1 server.
---
You got it folks, sharding forever.
---
Sorry those people are wrong.
---
The problem is, what if people won't die off? If they really remove layering after Phase 1 then a server could potentially get stuck with 9k people or more. (not that I'd mind but Blizzard would surely do as I am pretty sure they will cheapen out on the hardware as much as they can).
---
The other thing I don't get is why people are okay with layering, it is technically server merges at the end of the day, something that people don't want.
---
So somehow dynamic server scaling/merges are magically accepted by the community.
---
Traditional, completely separate server merges are not accepted.
---
I remember her being internet famous because she‚Äôs an attractive gamer grrl, but nothing else is of note.
---
Sure.
---
Correct you want the real experience go play it in a Pentium 3 with a 7900 and 1gb of ram.
---
Thanks, Yes well I've done it several times as a Nelf, just not the other way around with an attempt to do it as fast as humanly possible ;)
---
Blizzard: Mainstream people like sodatrashcan &gt; legit classic players that help the community with guides, etc
---
What if i told you that i don't watch streamers. I draw a line to my nerdiness. The unwarranted hate just ticks me off.
---
I think a lot of people also stick to the "yeah, but what if they keep it for too long" and all that kind of stuff. Honestly, by now I think it is unreasonable to not have any faith in the Classic team to handle this. They literally made up a new system just to cater to us. They could have just kept going with sharding, but they spend time and money just because the community didn't want sharding.
---
If they really did not care how it impacts the game they would have used sharding and called it a day.
---
Ok, speed levelling is hard. But that's moving the goal posts.
---
&gt; where many of them will probably play because of this exact reason
---
Awesome!
---
Warrior pre raid bis is mostly leather and mail.
---
I think they will invite more after some time. And Joana must get in then, anything else would be beyond stupid.
---
This first batch of beta testers is a publishing stunt, no doubt.
---
Can you give a good reason why it'd be any longer?
---
Why and what ?
---
What? Classic is using the 7.3.5 client. Private servers are running the old 1.12 client.
---
Some EU streamers could start in next 4 hours
---
one of the streamers did this yesterday and the orcs in the hills sent him back to loch modan. but a spider right inside the zone did send him to the graveyard there. so some graveyards might not have the same range as they do on pservers.
---
They're testing server and client stability and functionality. This is pretty standard procedure. You put your online game in a live environment 'cuz it's the most reliable way to get accurate readings. Then you start small to deal with any possible major issues and scale up to see how things develop with bigger traffic. 
---
The "game" might be old, but the code is a patchwork of new and old and needs rigorous testing.
---

Find out what her character name is, join her guild, pretend to be someone else.. secretly play with her.
---
I got in!
---
I opted in as soon as the announcement hit.
---
Not a content creator or streamer at all.
---
Subbed on and off from vanilla to BFA
---
Played BFA a little and then quit around January and resubbed a month ago.
---
I'm in the US
---
Account was created either in beta or day 1 of launch (can't remember, but I did beta test a little).
---
I played all through vanilla since launch day.
---
One man's "griefing" is another man's "playing the game" or something like that lol
---
from what I have seen they do run arround. e.g princess kiting arround fence in EW works.
---
As long as I have my Bartender add on I‚Äôll be good. That old action bar was loooooong.
---
I‚Äôm sure others will pop up as well. 
---
Maybe we get a return on CTMOD?
---
IKR? 
---
Classic was tough. I vividly recall drinking after every pull on my old mage. At low levels at least.
---
getting to 60 fast already yields enough benefits as is, but they become insane if you add several layers.
---
its the irony, that on one hand they make it waaay more profitable to rush to 60 extremely fast, but then their reasoning for removing og mounts is "we don't want people feel the need to rush through leveling".
---
Yea that's a bit lame. I am not subbed for a different game, therefore I am not eligible for beta invite.
---
You could just rewind clips back to the start, unless for some ungodly reason you want to be part of chat
---
that's dumb as fuck, layering is basically what I've been suggesting for months but you'd basically have to be a moron with zero brain function to not see how it has real downsides
---
Either that or Private fan forums has had higher range
---
On one hand we have Classic which is based on the *real* data from vanilla.
---
On the other hand we have OP with a 12 year old memory and a pserver 1.12 client that is more guesswork than anything.
---
I wonder which is more credible...
---
I guess this implies that invites are still going out step by step?
---
Than I'd say your defense of something nerdy while not being nerdy enough to actually partake in it is interesting.
---
Regen rates on the beta are probably faster right now than private servers. Mob damage, hit rate, and a bunch of other things seem totally off. I'm sure they'll fix it but I'm not sure how anyone can say the beta is more accurate than private servers atm.
---
Nope it was aids in Vanilla
---
This remembers me Jayce Hall lyrics song.
---
In August a new journey begins
---
What was your opinion on some of his bigger videos? Like the BRD one, or the scarab lord guides, or the Warlock deep dive? Are those the 1 solid video a week vids you are talking about compared to his "Update!!!" posts? Just curious.
---
As someone having played Runescape from 2005-2006 and later on, I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch OSRS, it's something you AFK in the background while watching movies/tv shows, lol.
---
Wait, that guys delusional when YOU are crying for not being gauranteed beta access for suddenly subbing?  L O L
---
I'm so very sorry for your loss mate. I hope playing classic again will bring you closer to your Brother and the memories you shared with him those years ago. See you in STV!
---
No, the point of the subreddit is not to ban people who oppose proposed changes but rather have space where the crowd who isn't #nochanges can discuss what they would like to see in classic+. Or just dream of what they want in classic+.
---
In what way the changes will be decided on I don't know. That is a topic of great importance and should probably be discussed thoroughly (maybe over on /r/classicwowplus).
---
I do trust developers, they are not evil people that are wildly different from you and I. I also assume that "ACTIBLIZZ" sees that there is not point in transitioning classic into the same gameplay and design philosophy as retail. They are pushing classic because they see an opening in the market for a more old-school MMORPG. They don't want to ruin that, neither the developers nor the company.
---
I do not believe that classic would die if it doesn't recieve new content. It would live on just as private servers have (as you mentioned). What I see is a great opportunity for an evolving game following the classic design philosophy. Something that I, and many others, really want to play and continue to play with new content for a long time.
---
How would it be? Serious.
---
thatsthejoke.jpg
---
It depends on what the new API will allow, IMO it won't be too difficult to backport retail addons that don't have stuff that doesn't make sense (or not allowed) on Classic.
---
ElvUI said they're coming to Classic, that a huge plus for me.
---
I also expect a QuestHelper equivalent since Questie was a thing in vanilla.
---
I'd love to also have Auctioner, Gatherer, Altoholic and Prat.
---
Because their modern servers can't handle that many people. The moment a huge raid descends upon Stormwind or Orgrimmar their servers will break.
---
Who hurt you?
---
What they Said in Tips interview
---
Any streamers actually testing stuff and filing bug reports, or are they just padding out their sub numbers?
---
Beta regen rates are SLOWER not faster. About twice as slow. Did you watch the interviews? Think Staysafe's one shows that.
---
yeah ;D
---
I got that from the quote, but I am sure there are some people complaining anyway
---
I'm going to assume there is one person out there actively trying to make this happen right now.
---
its their leather you get from skinning them. https://vanillawowdb.com/?itemset=143 is pre bis for rogue/hunter/warrior.
---
Can we already play the beta?
---
you can run up the moutains right of gnomeregan and jump down to the wetlands, its called mountain skip
---
Lmao, you getting 'abused' by the interns? Still sound like a sheep surounded by foxes if you can't even command the respect of interns.
---
Still you are missing the point of the comments you reply to. You need to go extreme no-life for several weeks for this to work for you. We don't talk about irony with the OG mount and things like that, we just say that the actual impact this will have on the game is minimal, and those very few that might be able to benefit from it already play so much that they will be rich no matter what.
---
You're right, played warrior main at launch through till BC. Not sure why you are getting so much heat. One would assume blizzard can doublecheck and see how it should be if their are any issues. 
---
This sub is turning into a defense force for blizzard like retail, unfortunate but expected.
---
Correct me if i'm wrong. The way layering is going to be done will end up having everyone on a realm and there will be four realms. The layers will collapse into themselves and you will have the single realm with the community aspect you want, no sharding between realms. 
---
Most of the people that go to play classic wont stay to it. I just joined a private server to see if it is something i would enjoy. I'm really enjoying the old school rpg mechanics of the game. I really like that as a mage, I have to watch my mana bar. The pacing is way less neurotic. You need to think about what you are doing while leveling. You can't just go anywhere, no heirloom gear. You can't buy gold with real money via wow tokens. 
---
I  grew up playing games like Baldur's gate. old school rpg mechanics are things I really dig. My parents wouldn't allow me to play classic as a kid due to the subscription because they thought it was absurd that a game had a monthly fee after you bought it.
---
Tons of people will abandon wow classic after a few weeks. I'd bet my bottom dollar you will end up with the community aspect you are looking for. The layering is being done because the people that can't handle the difficulty of classic will eventually leave in droves. Blizzard just wants to avoid ghost town realms.
---
I have no problem with streamers getting beta invites. I have problem that Blizz stopped it's official information delivery and that only streamers got invited to certain events. I might be a grumpy old man tho and basically nothing has changed, only "streamers" replaced old school "journalists". 
---
But I'm missing an official site from Blizz to contain all the information it has released in an organized form. You go up to this site and there is no information on layering for instance (or anything else): https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic 
---
That's what I'm missing.
---
Did you fail 1st grade math?
---
It is, at higher levels. If you have any actual evidence other than janky,  inaccurate private server bullshit then please share it with the world. Otherwise your so-called """feedback"""" is worse than useless.
---
You're delusional.
---
Probably because you started buying game time with wow tokens
---
It could be his location and or computer specs
---
Nope just have sub
---
What mobs?? Lol there are 5 minute respawn timers and a 10:1 player to mob ratio
---
I agree, retail combat text animation sucks
---
All the mobs seem to do less dmg and the player doesn't seem to get nearly as many weapon misses it looks like.
---
&gt;gray gear deleting level 10 rare...
---
Rare mobs have same HP and DPS as normal mobs. Only if it is a rare elite (silver dragon with a wing) will they be tougher.
---
You don't even know what a rare is, maybe you should read a basic 101 guide before trying to sound smart.
---
You literally interact with a player in order to request the invite
---
The human spirit racial did not cause a noticeable difference in regen like that.  Also, 240p or not, you can clearly see the regen speed of the health and mana bars there.
---
brb buying a rocket.
---
Show me on the doll where asmongold touched you
---
I think he means you don't actually have to talk to the person.
---
This!
---
Seems like some people are comparing Classic with private servers. I don't believe Blizzard knows his product less than some enthusiasts that can only try to emulate WoW the best they can, without  access to Blizzard's database, needind to rely on old patch notes, what community says is wrong or right and their memory.
---
Even if there are some things not right, let's just give developers some time, they can check old data and do the fixes wnhen needed.
---
Yeah you're probably right retard
---
I doubt Asmongold would find classic ‚Äùhard‚Äù, maybe his Twitch persona though
---
What I havent seen anyone mention is the probability of massive issues on launch due to a new system like this. I remember when they started using sharding heavily and pretty much every major launch had major issues with server capacity which then messed up the sharding.  
---
I might be mistaken and I really hope so, but I guess we will see in August :)
---
You make around 200g/hr farmin devilsaur on single server. If you optimise 3-4 layers perfectly you can make 4k gold in a day
---
Dude. I am going to level a druid. It will take me probably like 4 months to get to 60. My endgame options are limited due to personal schedule. I guess I will be happy to see inside of MC 2-3 months after max lvl. 5 man dungeons, bgs and wpvp is what I live for!
---
No you dont. If you follow a preplanned path ima bet there are ppl who get it in or even before 3 days /played.
---
Especially with layers making lvling easier because there will be less ppl fighting for mobs and you can hop layers to avoid world PvP if necessary. Its gonna be interesting to see how many ppl hit 60 before week 1 is over
---
Didn't they buff or acknowledge regen was higher than it was supposed to be during the demo? Wonder if they even removed that.
---
Checked my launcher, saw the drop-down, got all excited. Clicked the drop-down, all ready to get the install going, only to find it was just to toggle between my former main account, and the two starter edition accounts I acquired over the years. Balls!
---
Esfand is also gonna be on that server, and a lot of smaller streamers.
---
&gt;So in reality it's not as much "when you kill it" as it is "when you kill it in relation to other guilds", at which point it's not really the boss you're competing against, it's the other guilds.
---
What point are you trying to make? The harder something is the slower guilds kill it. 
---
The way blizzard balanced content is that they nerf and you get more gear over time.
---
Generally the nerfs are more impactful.
---
WHEN you kill it is important because it relates to the NERFS and the GEAR.
---
Obviously we're talking about a standard well tuned boss. Trying to talk in abstract about some theoretical edge case impossible boss or hugely undertuned boss is stupid and irrelevant.
---
&gt;Either you don't know what that means or I'm genuinely curious curious at which premise I'm sneaking in.
---
That classes in live having some kind of mobility actually allows for a buffer to mistakes. Rather than the content being tuned so that you need to use that mobility and thus you cannot use that mobility to counteract any mistakes because you then wouldn't have it for the required mechanic.
---
This is still off topic from your original statement though. 
---
&gt;Yes, the boss hp/damage is tuned around people being able to move during periods where movement is required, if no one could do anything during those periods, those numbers would be reduced and as such the only change in difficulty that comes as a result of everyone having instant casts/ability to cast while moving is a buffer for mistakes.
---
So having movement DOESN'T actually make anything easier after all?
---
Again, this is a completely different topic to your original statement anyway.
---
&gt;It's only utter bs to the point you're trying to straw man it, to the point you are where you claim being able to move and still do full d/hps is the same as being able to do so constantly.
---
Nope. I dropped the word "constantly" the second you got hung up on it for no reason. It isn't important nor relevant.
---
Also, you still haven't addressed your original statement, especially in regard to how mythrax is an obvious example that its completely incorrect.
---
people will go on vacation on release and have experience from pservers. a lot of people will be 60 2 weeks in.
---
How is that weird? two people and one of them did a crit. That is what happens when you crit a mob.
---
0 valid evidence presented, nice
---
Props for acknowledging it. A lot of people seem to be to ignorant to do that.
---
Yeah I know.  It's obviously a holdover from modern client.  Report it and move on.
---
AHH I see, was shaman back then, did hearthglen world epic farm instead
---
Who
---
Except they also said youd be able to phase into your friends shard. Idk how much more clear they need to make this.
---
A lot

Soundtrack
---
What happens if that opportunity turns out to be a disaster? Do you give everyone a server? What about TBC and WotLK, and everyonbe's vision of whether LFG should or shouldn't be implemented again, in case we get WotLK.
---
There are 2 things that can happen, either you split the community to a breaking point, or you force changes on everyone. And this time you better hope it doesn't backfire.
---
People want changes
---
People want TBC
---
People want WoTLK
---
People want Classic vanilla
---
Also people want different rule servers for every single one of these.
---
What if someone decides one day to make a sub about "TBC+"?
---
This is the whole problem with this classic+, everyone and their mothers want something. Its "follow that philosophy, it will be fine", wishful thinking nothing more.
---
Can you make everyone happy? Who should be ignored, what happens if enough ignored people request a "true" vanilla server again? You know, something that happens even in OSRS.
---
Can you split the community enough, without breaking everything and introducing CRZ? What about people that want fresh servers instead of a new game and new content?.
---
Thing is, you don't simply discuss something, you go all in or you don't go at all. The very nature of opening that box is it turning into an unstoppable tide of changes and sad people.
---
&gt;I feel like he should be taking a bit more damage.
---
Fortunately, Blizzard is making Classic based on the *real* vanilla data and not your feelings.
---
It's the legion Clint so you need add-ons that work with the client. I think 7.3.5 but idk. If your bfa addons work with the client of legion (maybe just use old version) then you should be good
---
Retail wow is profitable because they added microtransactions and gold selling while reducing server costs. It is without a doubt that retail wow in its current state has less subscribers than ever. Without subscribers MMOs cannot have a future. They have definitely lost touch with what made the game so great. So many aspects of retail are just depressingly bad and unenjoyable. The game is so disjointed and such a mess with scaling and itemization for anything outside of max level.
---
Good luck getting a invite without interaction. I see this more forming raid tool, where now ppl use addons with keywords to get autoinvited.
---
Yes, thats my entire point. Then its no difference from "sharding but instead of smaller areas, it's continent based".
---
They could just make it so that when you invite someone from a different layer the lower level one goes to the higher levels layer and only if they're both the same level  will the invited person go the inviters layer.
---
At least this way it'll be harder for the people way ahead to abuse it as they'd have to get invited by someone who's higher level or equal that also happens to be on a different layer and you can't just "fish" for different layers on low level alts.
---
Sounds like you want the heart of the wild spec that skarm and Taladril champion.
---
I'd imagine servers will start with at least two layers (maybe several more for the first week). They'd expect X number of logins per 5 seconds and if this was exceeded they can add a new layer immediately. People who can be safely moved (those out of combat for more than 30seconds perhaps) can be pushed to the new layer along with everyone who logs in, until that layer matches the population of the other layers.
---
When servers reboot (either weekly or because it's a new expac and they're always unstable as hell and go down constantly) they could start automatically with the predicted optimum number of layers based on the number of active players from the previous week/session. 
---
I'd guess there are many ways of handling layer populations without affecting farming/grinding too noticeably.
---
So there would be some noob in a unfortunate layer waiting hours for a devilsaur to spawn but it never will because they only spawn on layer 1?
---
As long as it doesn‚Äôt get into the game I‚Äôm all fine with people theorizing. Good luck.
---
And i made up a post that dismantled all this bs.
---
The fact that people thinks that heal and mana regen at the same speed or value is the period that 90% people here are pserver posers
---
Maybe, and I am not even sure for the HP regen...
---
but mana is absolutely 100% off, just watch any stream that plays a mana user and see their regen, and compare it to that video
---
oo oo aa aa
---
Yeah i would never trust it for bosses.  Mostly just use to roughly verify that things are in the ballpark for leveling content.
---
Shouldn't you be thanking private servers and people like me?   Without us Classic wouldn't exist.
---
Playing on a private server is pretty negligible comparison to putting slot machines into your video games and promoting them for children.
---
&gt; The fact that people thinks that heal and mana regen at the same speed or value 
---
No one has said that.
---
I know it's not the same as when I experienced it in-game all those years ago, but the music of classic (and beyond really) is something I play quite often in the background any time i'm at the PC. It's all just so good.
---
No, why should they? Better graphics are completely optional to play with and give no gameplay advantage.
---
My biggest fear is not layering, bugs or slight character selection UI changes. My fear is that this sub is an accurate representation of what the Classic community will be like.
---
Hopefully it is just a dumb vocal minority, because otherwise Classic is dead on arrival to me - and not because of Blizzard.
---
DaVinci
---
And how exactly does having a few layers with thousands of people on each help prevent large scale raids..?
---
Layering's here at the beginning for when 2000 people enter Northshire at once, not for when a few hundred raid a capital city.
---
No its mainly for the streamers, empty servers best way to test mmo game :D
---
Are you catholic?
---
Joana! I bought his (thought it wa a her) guide back in the day when levelling my first char. oh the memories. I had no idea she (he) was still playing? thought he (she) quit?
---
The retail wow sub is 90% art/drawing threads, compare that to this sub where people post about the actual game.
---
I hope your future son is a drag queen, trannykiller.
---
Did you just gatekeep keybinds?
---
Yeah, but he can't go like "hey, remember that one time when this mob in Silverpine..."
---
Go back to your safe space nerd
---
But it's profitable. That's my point.
---
Nothing is free. Changing every tiny little thing like this just eats up development time.
---
Anyone complaining about stuff like this and also complaining that the release date is an oxymoron.
---
Can't remember the name of the green plate wrists, but I remember comparing them to Loomguard and decided to change them. Same thing with the MH after progressive itemization got flushed down the drain.
---
The sooner you break those chains the better you‚Äôll be. I never get how people can stand hating on others for simply doing what they like - with the obvious exception of not hurting or affecting others (#consent).
---
There‚Äôs so many absurd examples, everything from benign hobbies, to sexual preference, choice of clothes or the color of your hair. 
---
When you feel free to do you, and especially free enough to just let others do their thing and not shame them for it, you‚Äôll be much happier in general.
---
It doesn't become funnier just because you post it twice

Once a cobra bit Chuck Norris' leg. After five days of excruciating pain, the cobra died.
---
Thank you for making a good point, most other responses have been bullshit so far.
---
We‚Äôre trying to start up a bit of an Oceanic Classic community on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/Q4NsU5J) if you feel like hanging out and complaining about servers and stuff.
---
Hi, /u/DerelictDonkeyEngine
---
Mhhh but are WoW and Runescape comparable ? RuneScape is open End Sandbox i tought and WoW Classic is a Themepark MMO (alltough feels much more free compared to modern mmos) with "endcontent" that will be fully released at some point, and while Private server players manage to play Wrath for 10 years straight im not sure about Retail Vanilla players.
---
Whenever i rolled a new character i wanted it to be on the top, so i just deleted all others. So even though i leveled many characters, i only ever had 1 at  a time.
---
*When a karma grab backfires.*
---
I‚Äôm fine with it. 
---
Let‚Äôs not pretend that MC is going to be difficult.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it being a bit easier to get tedious things like fire resistance.
---
The few BiS items from quest rewards are a bit concerning but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to break the game.
---
You know the databases isn‚Äôt the only thing that constitutes vanilla? They would‚Äôve had hard coded calculations based on those database value that may be very different in this version that‚Äôs based on patch 8.x. I‚Äôve seen Joanna‚Äôs vids and some of the beta streamers and the health regen in particular for low levels at least seems way too high in this new version.
---
Hello, where is the sign up form?
---
You can crank a lot of stuff up that wasn't in 2004 WoW, like shadows and foliage.
---
It no where close to the same challenge in retail. Classic is a casual amazing game, but if you want competition and difficult retail provides way more depth and options.
---
The point people are making is that this is simply showing something that used to be hidden and is giving us a show of what occurs under the hood.
---
Only if it kills you. If it in no way inhibits your ability to play classic, or even... if it were to enable your playing! The possibilities are endless..
---
That is why this murloc is my notification sound on my smartphone since years.... Soooo good
---
Ah, I see. They said one line without any extraneous explanations of limitations or prioritizing so we can just jump straight to worst case scenarios. I'm glad everyone else has an uncle working at blizzard who can confirm all of this because apparently I'm the only person who missed the in depth explanation that confirmed all these exploits.
---
&gt;They can limit the spawns to exactly the same number as 1 layers would result. Just add a check that it will pick on WHAT layer the normal spawn happens.
---
I'm sorry but it's more complicated than that. And definitely something we should be worried about.
---
Will creatures just disappear in front of you when they are killed? If not, are you going to be able to kill for example prince in arathi multiple times for tidal charm by hopping layers if he is up in all layers?
---
So it's not just the challenge of making the technical change which may or may not be possible, it's the change of gameplay when you add something that wasn't in vanilla.
---
Its not about you or me or "the feels", it's about bring careful who you give your money to.
---
&gt;Its a bunch of stories, that is, quest chains that are mostly unrelated.
---
Well its an MMORPG afterall so it make sense.
---
yeah, although i think STVietnam will be hell on every layer :D  
---
CANT WAIT
---
Kind of like when you go to a subreddit for cracked games and news that a game is going to have denuvo and everyone claims they would have bought it but since it has denuvo they are just going to pirate the game. Yeah fucking right buds.
---
Its just thats how sharding works in retail and this is literally just sharding renamed. So ya know 1 + 1 = 2. It just adds up.
---
What's up with the weak and unoriginal memes in this sub lately
---
Well, obvious answer to that could be that you would take the total number of players in all layers, made a random roll weighted with the number of players in each layer and spawn it in one.
---
Like theres 3000 pll in layer 1 and 1000 in layer two. Do a /random 4000, if the roll is 1-3000, it will spawn in layer 1 and 3001-4000 in layer 2.
---
&gt;The other thing I don't get is why people are okay with layering, it is technically server merges at the end of the day, something that people don't want.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;So somehow dynamic server scaling/merges are magically accepted by the community.  
---
&gt;Traditional, completely separate server merges are not accepted.
---
The difference is that Layering is automatic server merges where you know that you end up with every one you have been playing with since season 1, and depending on how layering works, you might get some extra players from different layers as well.
---
&gt;what if people won't die off? If they really remove layering after Phase 1 then a server could potentially get stuck with 9k people or more. 
---
After a while, players will settle into a pattern for when they play. 
---
All 9k will not be playing at the same time. 
---
They can have queues for the peak times, and worst case, they can offer free server transfers from overpopulated realms.
---
The challenge will be the AQ event.
---
Layering seems like the smoothest solution to the high demand at launch compared to the long term stable load on each realm.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
lol are you fucking retarded
---
awww yiss
---
its anger
---
I think the biggest problem with all of your arguments are that you base everything on that #nochanges is the neutral and good option. I REALLY do not see a problem discussing what you think would be cool to see in the case they decide to do classic+. The truth is: you can simply discuss something. Words do not hurt and they do not break the classic experience.
---
ACTIBLIZZ and the developers have it their best interest to keep the classic experience intact. If they have both a classic more old-school version of the game at the same time as they have retail they will attract two audiences where as before they would attract only one.
---
No I don't think there should be one million servers for every little opinion from the community. There should be one version of the game and it's new content should be decided by the developers. I do not believe good things will come from the "mob rule" as you call it. If they follow the classic design philosophy (and I trust they will) we will have an amazing game on our hands.
---
Keep crying it‚Äôs not a change
---
Oh good, I was hoping things that simple wouldn't require a plugin
---
Then calling people who ask him why he's not strimin classic "a bunch of fucking 10 year olds". Lul
---
great story, i played classic too but i was 15years old. The game that me and my brother played like ur story would be diablo 2. we played so much d2 1hr each back to back non stop. good times.
---
I've legit beta tested a lot of Blizzard games and reported all of their bugs and even dedicated my name to Betas in general and in the end I still didn't get an invite!
---
Yeah, but that doesn't make it feel any better when your prey just phase away. I don't care if the place he goes is also full of PvP, it was MY kill!
---
That video is from 2008, I.e. burning crusade.
---
Yes and that's fine! Peoples opinion on what the best version of the game would be are different.
---
Totally. 
---
Shedo the druid has some great content on YouTube pushing feral dps to the limit and getting some great results right through AQ40. 
---
You're limited in your "hybridness" by the spec you run. You generally have to sacrifice one role in favour of the other two.
---
So generally you choose between:
---
Pure dps spec
---
Pure tank spec
---
Pure heal spec
---
Tank/DPS spec (there are a few different options)
---
Tank/Heal spec (Heart of the Wild)
---
P.s. check out Skarm for bear tanking content on YouTube, and Taladril's written guide
---
We need a part 2
---
Yea if you level fast you deserve to use exploits that didn't even exist in vanilla. Hell, you deserve to use cheats and bots too, let's have special exemption on bans of those who levelled fast.
---
Character arrangement on the selection screen is obviously something that doesn't matter, and in some small ways does actually make vanilla better imo. I used to hate that I couldn't put my current main at the top.
---
There are some gray areas when we talk about QOL in general though. When they upped the stack size of crafting mats, people call that a quality of life change. I would be pretty upset if that was something that was left in.
---
I was watching him, that guy got down voted because it's s straight up lie
---
Oh shut up
---
Streamers are cancer
---
cool story bro wish my bro got into WOW but we were very different lol.
---
congratulations on being able to make such wonderful memories with your brother whilst he was with us :)
---
Answered that in another post in same thread.
---
The post got about right amount of negativity, toxicity and dense people just like back in the vanilla days. Glad we kept that convention going on.
---
rip, i boycott blizzard.
---
It's a depiction of the Alliance getting wrecked by Rag. What's not to like?
---
They already set that world bosses and rare respawns and that there would be only 1 versions of them active right?
---
Why are you being downvoted lol the circle jerk is too real
---
Look at the player characters in the image. They're all Alliance characters.
---
They obviously let in a lot of vanilla players with many years subscribed (first wave).  That says they prioritized loyal customers over popular people.  
---
Fine with me, that‚Äôs probably how I got selected.
---
Yes that's how it's always been like. On Classic though you will be able to reserve three names on a server, I think it's a nod to streamers but what's stopping a gang of trolls to just grab that name on every server faster than a streamer can? I don't really understand the point.
---
I haven‚Äôt watched much Twitch in my time but I wanted to share that I watched Towellie for a few hours yesterday as he leveled through Elwynn. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand the hate. Yea he‚Äôs sucking on a vape half the time but, to be perfectly honest, he acted less ‚Äústreamerie‚Äù than most of the channels I‚Äôve come across over the years. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying he should have gotten in over Joana, because obviously Joana is diehard Vanilla, I just don‚Äôt get the hate against this dude in particular. Even if he smack talked Classic in the past...
---
alright, thanks!
---
Do you really need to have played vanilla for this bug?
---
Classic is an open, living world; there isn't really a centralized story to follow the way that there is in the expansions. I can anything that would count as a spoiler.
---
not really. I want the complete classic wow experience, not something new. I am perfectly fine getting the finished game. If he wants something else, start begging for tbc servers
---
Judging by this thread it's absolutely in Blizzard's interest to keep this beta small and select. Because most of the "bug reports" are coming from Private Server players who are so used to numbers based on asspulls and guesswork that their so-called feedback is less than worthless and would just waste Blizzard's time.
---
I'm not saying I should get it, stop putting words into my mouth. However there are people that deserve it way more than Towcuck.
---
And to add to my previous statement, im surprised there anyone left with even an ounce of good will left for blizz. They literally tore down and crushed WoW with their own hands by and dont listen to what their fans are saying or want. This is just another case of them thinking they know what we want better then we do. 
---
People were already upset about sharding in the lvl 1 to 10 zones and their response to that outrage was to shard the whole game? How is there anyone defending this anymore is beyond me.
---
No. I have no idea what I'm looking at. D:
---
Is that a bug tho? I'm assuming that they have the actual values from that patch, whereas a lot of private servers are gesswork?
---
No, you are assuming they are the same thing. I'm going to wait until after the stress tests before I start shitting on it.
---
He didn't though. That's the problem. He made a joke, literally laughing when he said it ffs
---
Hello cleavage my old friend
---
&gt; But didnt you have to enter a realm/server, to know whether that name was taken or not already? 
---
I don't remember this ever being the case, you're told a name is taken when you push the create button, *before* entering the game.
---
Yep. Any client side stuff in a 1.12 client is going to be correct. It‚Äôs the server side stuff the public lacks a good reference of.
---
Teeb when did I play with you? I have you on my friends list but I don't remember from where!
---
Planned my 3week holiday a long time ago. Apears it starts a couple days before launch. Perfect ü§ì
---
You cannot make people stick to layers because then you would not be able to play with friends. You would not be able to play with your guildmates. And so on. It's like having your cake and eating it too, it's just not possible to prevent layer hopping without also breaking the game in major way.
---
Good lad. I told my boss that I'm sitting in my pants playing video games for a week when I booked it off when I could not give a shit.
---
the whole expansion was designed with flying mounts in mind. you can't just add a few bridges and think that resolves the issue. making TBC non-flying would require a complete redesign of an important feature of the game (i.e. traveling)
---
thats a good thing, 20% more profit for blizz
---
I'm still unsure on this. Take a look at Staysafe's Warlock during the Media Summit after he kills a Boar (13:16 roughly, can't link on mobile). https://youtu.be/wCj_kverRhM
---
It takes about 20 seconds for him to regen to full from slightly above half. Looking at your video, it looks like they regenerate similar percentages of MP?
---
&gt; But I highly recommend BFA, the game is amazing mythic +‚Äôs, PvP and raids are the best content wow has ever had for competitive players.
---
just, factually not correct.
---
You are the perfect example of someone being too stupid to understand an argument.
---
I never said streamers made the game how it is or changed anything.
---
I said that streamers and content creators and the hype that they created is the reason that classic will be released.
---
All I am saying is that no one gave a fuck about you guys before they brought you into the spotlight.
---
ew, so nerdy.
---
Nobodies opinion is relevant but my own to me. I've been recommended so many bad movies that I don't trust a single person in the world anymore.
---
Leveling mining in OSRS while watching Classic streams right now, can confirm.
---
[It's wonderful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfWBF-WhRMM)
---
Classic will be much, much more demanding than the vanilla client.   
---
What happens when you try to run BFA?  I am on Mac also, btw.   
---
I think the requirements will be a bit below what is needed for BFA.  Hopefully you can run it.   
---
The actual released requirements will be useless, I am expecting.  They might now give us new sys. reqs. and just keep the BFA ones.
---
What? You do know what sharding is right? And you do realize layering is just sharding right? It does literal the same thing sharding does except its the whole game instead of individual zones.
---
How are you getting lost here?
---
OMG STOP SPAMMING FFS
---
Players who actually played during Vanilla era just don't give a s\*\*\* about streamers. I guess we are too old to enjoy watching people play. If I have free time I play, I don't watch. So I think streamers will play because they need to be on the hype train to get more viewers, but they will leave soon enough. Especially because the rythm of Classic is especially boring to watch (long fly paths, AFK for crafting...)
---
I watched asmongold for an hour or so, he encountered multiple bugs and didn't report any of them
---
Ah, a man of UML culture I see...
---
I don't think it's a huge deal tbh since the sub gives you classic plus retail except current expac
---
To be fair, I played in 04 in high school, graduated college in ‚Äò11, and finally went back for my MS in ‚Äò18. So yeah. Played in 04, in school in 19
---
Because in a time of outrage for everything, and SJWs, I do not trust people to fairly judge a report.  Let's pretend it is all done by people for a sec.  The bitching by people that it is taking too long to ban people within the game will be immense if even justified.  If they have a report feature it will destroy the game.  Any man-made system will not take care of things fast enough, be biased, and I can see this shit company caving to pressure and putting in an automated reporting system that is abused later because people whine.  You are eventually fucked by people with limited information making a decision or eventually later fucked by a computer.  This game is dead if any reporting feature exists and the original Classic WOW never had one.
---
Okay, I mean.. This makes my shitty videos look oscar worthy..
---
Did you read his post?
---
Because he created a *new subreddit* to discuss things unpopular here, just don't join if you're not interested?
---
33.33% more actually
---
not in the beta at all - for now
---
Okay well that's the dumbest thing I've read all day.
---
Compared to vanilla? It absolutely is. And sure some raids where better, or some PvP seasons, but the culmination of everything has the best options for competitive players.
---
You realize people refer to university as school right?
---
Woosh holy fuck dude are you serious or just can't understand a joke?
---
ah cool, that makes sense.
---
You ever degauss a monitor kid? You ever clean the gunk out of the wheels in a ball mouse? Does the word "Clippy" mean anything to you?
---
War. War never changes...
---
Not quiet sure what you mean with 1/29/21 being the bet overall spec, you mean in a sense that you can do all roles + be decent in PvP? Then yeah. But it's definitely not the best spec if you want to focus on PvP, or focus on healing/tanking etc. I personally am going to use it for phase 1 just so I can tank AND heal dungeons for gear, but after you're done farming dungeons there really is no reason to stay that spec, unless ur guild wants you to offtank raids.
---
Are you really being honest with yourself here though ? Streamers wont be the only ones to beta test the game. There will be many waves and plenty of time for "real" beta testers to do their thing.
---
If there are problems at classic launch I hope we wont blame the streamers for getting beta 1 week earlier and not reporting a bug
---
omegapoggers
---
I think a guy who's not that interested in classic but played vanilla is probably a more valuable beta tester than someone who never played vanilla but is hyped for classic. There's at least an argument there.
---
Harassed by interns? Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? :p
---
I literally just searched "best class" in this sub and get a shit ton of results with threads about best class for all kinds of gamemodes, guides, etc. And then there is google.
---
I'm sure we don't need another thread for this.
---
It wont be an OG experience if I don‚Äôt take masturbation breaks every hour like the good ol‚Äô days.
---
it's ok not to have an interest in streamers
---
I know... It was meant like how dare he suggest that horde &gt; alliance
---
Nobody really wants to watch someone fill out a bug report, I understand why they wouldn't. They are there for the free "viral" marketing. I wish Blizzard had a better way for people watching those streams to report stuff. There are non-streamers in there though. Hopefully they are reporting issues.
---
Bear in mind that this subreddit has a *heavy* presence of former private server players and private servers were always a bastion of the really dedicated fans.
---
The population of this subreddit trends towards the hardcore far more prominently than the general population of Classic WoW will.
---
There is a simple solution. 
---
Just put in a limit where you can only accept a cross layer invite if you are in a rested area, similar to the War Mode toggle in retail.
---
Cross layer invites should still be fine for playing with your friends, but harder to use to exploit farming
---
Yeah, im right There with you Buddy :D
---
Sadly neither my department or interns lol.
---
Wait for classic
---
Considering people have been telling me how I should feel about classic since vanilla servers were first introduced and they were literally always wrong I'm not inclined to listen to you here.
---
I've done the lvl60 grind on private servers twice (one with 12x xp  one blizzlike) and back in the days on live. The game is punishing and certainly not slow. Worms is slow. A game doesn't have to be fucking DOOM to not be considered slow.
---
I mean the BlizzCon demo was also the 1.12 database bit messed up bit still and lots of dmg and regen valuse were very wrong so its entirely possible that some numbers are still wrong.
---
Multiple people online at the same time?
---
Nah, I don't believe it ! It's outrageous, I say !
---
It will be for phase 1. Which includes MC and Ony. It's not a huge stretch to say phase 1 will last until at least some players are in these instances. Especially since there is no scheduling for phases. Blizzard has said they plan on rolling out phases whenever they feel they are appropriate.
---
I would personally *like* phase 1 to last a little longer than the first 3 weeks. I definitely don't have the time or desire to make it to these raids on time.
---
Nobody else wondering what the hell "Just chatting" is?
---
No changes
---
I wanna edit the wow ui to have a little ‚ÄúWelcome to beta!‚Äù Window.
---
No one is saying they are balanced, but we also don't care because it's a fun game.
---
this should be pinned or something
---
If you want to be competitive then no, you would need to farm consumables like crazy and it definitely doesn't fit a casual raiding style. 
---
If you're content with doing mediocre dps then sure. MC and the likes can easily be offtanked by a feral as long as you know what you're doing and got at least some gear for it. It might be hard during the early phases because most of the bear items come from PvP (rank 10+) which might not be attainable casually.
---
Omg it's really good man!
---
Now I need a horde version x,D
---
Right. I'm obviously bring facetious to make a point. If you don't feel right supporting Activision, that's obviously your prerogative. I personally don't see them as a big bag evil company. I see them at company doing what it take to appear shareholders. Like any public organization, that is there responsibility. And they are good at it. 
---
I think there are tons worse companies. We just rarely hear about then because the whole wide world is corrupt. I choose to pay $15 a month for a game that helps me forget that fact. :D
---
Those who play the beta can report the bugs in-game.
---
I once did. Was raiding SoO at the time. I stopped for a while after that haha
---
Not everyone logs in at the same moment.
---
I am going to try an RP server this time. I always get distracted by fishing, cooking, working the AH, exploring, professions, etc. Especially when you hit a plateau it's nice to take a break from grinding. I didn't start to rush last time until BC was on the horizon.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if at least a quarter of this sub is a group of low-functioning, socially inept adults..
---
BFA was bad enough to make me quit for good. If you don't like classic that's fine. But fucking leave me alone with your opinion..
---
The world difficulty and thebdifficulty the average player experiences was miles higher in classic. Top end raiders have a similar or harder difficulty than back in the days, but only for their respective content. The world is piss easy and dingeons and raids are for the largest part of the community as well.
---
Staysafe checked and mana is actually regenning 50% slower on classic beta than on the current big private servers.
---
People playing wow way too much and taking a long time to finish their education doesn't sound like much of a contradiction.
---
"mobs are regenning more than they're suppose to"
---
"You don't miss as much as you're suppose to"
---
Just vague crap by people who don't know any better.
---
I believe it has nothing to do with streamers but with the fact that noone has any idea of how many people will play at launch nor how many will last throught the initial surge.
---
Having people subbing in advance to reserve names is a good way to gauge the interest.
---
To reserve names you need an active sub and you can only reserve 3 names *per account*, there could be some trolling but I doubt many people would waste money just to troll on names.
---
At launch you can be sure many people will rush on every server to create chars for name-keeping but that's a different matter.
---
This is... not a good thing.
---
Just switch layer 4Head
---
What time did you get your email?
---
is there a tldr
---
OK mom.
---
Discipline Priests was actually a thing in classic.
---
As first Mage main and later Druid main  I can say that:
---
Mage:
---
Arcane mage was fun but useless. Not enough dps
---
Firemage was a lot of dps but until aq40 everything was fire resistant
---
Frostmage was worst but the only spec useable for MC/BWL
---
Druid:  
---
Balance was crap
---
Feral bear was ok for instances but missing a taut is a huge deal
---
Feral cat was ok damage but if I wanted to play rouge I would use a rouge
---
Restro was the only good spec in vanilla as a druid. But the problem was you could only rezz 1 peson every 30min/60min (dunno the exactly time)
---
But thats not the point of the old spec trees.  You ware able to combine different talents. For example the 3 Minute Pyro amge where you were able to cast an instant pyro blast every 3 minutes. This was fun if there was a duell with a warrior who thought he would beat the crap out of you. You kite him until he is half hp and then B√ÑM - he dead.
---
this was fun
---
for a few months yes
---
We are both drunk! 
---
Cause you're too stupid to understand what "hands-on" means, lmfao. 
---
But I wasn't being salty in that post, I was literally observing that in action today based on the cluster-fuck of new players to WoW all going after the same wolf. 
---
But yes, let's expect those people to go find a private server that has some differences. 
---
Also, oftentimes a 'y' changes to an 'i', English is cool. Example for you! "Saltiness" and "crybabies". 
---
dunno if i'm berating enough and stupid enough to speak your language or not yet? 
---
meh, I "tryed"... lol
---
Not as baseline for good streamer, but as baseline of someone that could bring lots of followers into his realm of choice.
---
Has anyone determined if reputation values for quests are correct and if the expected 25% spillover reputation to other factions is implemented in the Beta? And if so, at what point does spillover rep start (from the very first quest or not until after the newbie zones) and stop (honored, revered, half way through one or the other)?
---
Then we have server splits. But that's unlikely: what's more likely is that we get to avoid server merges.
---
Yes, it's viable! And there are many hybrid talent builds. You want to farm an on-use weapon in Gnomergan prior to raids (if you want to be close to the top dps).
---

Private server guild. Don‚Äôt worry about it, they‚Äôre lame.
---
Lol I didn‚Äôt think of it that way. Now it‚Äôs sad.
---
way 2 make me feel even more scammed
---
Hes using a third party program to cheat. Thats not a bug or exploit of the game itself.
---
&gt; literally ported the 1.12 database so it contains EXACTLY the same values as the original game at that stage.
---
You realise hp/mana regen is a formula rooted deep within the core gameplay mechanics, and not some flat value you pull out of a database? Same thing with hit/miss chance, it's also a formula.
---
If you do understand this, it then becomes very easy to see how the base formulas could be wrong since what we're playing is actually a dumbed down legion, the default for everything is legion, not 1.12.
---
You care wayyyy too much.
---
Eh, I would've liked to experience a bit of nostalgia on the class/race combos I only really want to play for 20-30 levels, but I guess that's not an option for me, since I'm not subbing just for a chance to get in. xD
---
I love how the title says "Wow classic video" but the thumbnail literally has a Blood Elf.
---
it took forever for OSRS to get its own section
---
And my problem is your optimism that everything will work out just fine.
---
If we are discussing possibilities, tell me what if they break the game. What happens then? And why do you trust them so much? Is the fact that WoW is bleeding people, diablo immortal, Activision greed, laying 800+ off, questionable decisions about assigning people for Phone games? 
---
Im supper happy that they are doing Classic, but that team has nothing to do with the team it was back then. You have like 2-3 people left and they will be thrown around 10 different projects one Classic is ready.
---
You (and me) are against the "Mob rule" and there is a good reason for this, but leaving it all in the hands of the people that made us want classic in the first place? Well...sorry but i don't share your optimism. I can't forbid you to discuss these things, but im yet to see anything else than "same philosophy" being used as an excuse for bonus content. 
---
Try giving like 10 examples and you will be surprised how much holes they will possibly have.
---
Adding more content, trivializes content eventually, it cannot progress like it is in classic all the way to infinity. Introducing more things will cause people to ask for even more. You know that is true and you know there is a change of failure. If you want to take that route, then ok, but if i don't, someone get's left behind, and this is the root of the problem. Also you want them to work on 2 MMOs and assign team that is 100% for Classic+ which should follow the same path as Vanilla did. I hope ou realize that making Retail is easier than this. An the reason is that it will take &gt;one&lt; slip to bring it all down.
---
Wow pvp might leave him missing daoc pvp... But every other system in wow is so much better.
---
wat
---
Trying to make everything balanced is what killed class flavor and thematics.
---
If you want to play a balance Druid that‚Äôs as strong as mage, then you don‚Äôt want to play a balance Druid. Leave it to those who find it fun and find something else.
---
Grow up you utter weirdo.
---
I still think people are overreacting. Sure, the *first* person, maybe even the few few, on each server with presumably \~10k players to get to a level high enough to solo devilsaurs is probably going to have the time of his life, if he figures out layer hopping. I'll admit that. But very rapidly more and more people are going to reach the same point and start doing the same thing. Layer hopping is no use when you've got 10 people on each layer doing the exact same thing. At some point it's going to be easier to just stick to one layer and run the circuit.
---
Yeah, but pretty much only if you roll Alliance. That at least benefit from Blessings over there.
---
Well at least you don't have to worry about female streamers in the Classic WoW section =)
---
Well, that explains most of the post on this sub.
---
Same. 1-2 damage a hit seems off.
---
What am I even reading
---
Yes you die from fall damage and can res at menthil harbor.
---
Its not gone.  
---
Its still there.
---
Yes, let's invite "pro" retail players to the classic beta instead. Fuck the original vanilla players.
---
you can't?
---
i mean i don't really get it, what else would i be doing when sick? its not like playing wow somehow hinders recovery.
---
&gt;Since I was able to play Vanilla on a pserveur , do you think I will have the same error message when Classic will be out ?   
---
You will have the same message.  However, you may be able to ignore it and play Classic.  
---
Vanilla client = very easy to run on old Macs.   
---
Classic client = will be 10x more demanding than the vanilla client.       
---
I am not sure but any decent graphics card should be good enough to run WoW.  Maybe another subreddit can give you good advice on what card to buy.   
---
I don't know if your CPU will be strong enough, but I am guessing it would be enough with a good graphics card.      
---
Info:  
---
https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_pro/faq/mac-pro-default-graphics-cards-dvi-dual-link-mini-displayport.html   
---
I bet build a PC subreddit would help you pick the right card.   https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/   
---
_________    
---
I am guessing just getting a new graphics card would be enough, but to know better, I would want to understand how strong your CPU is.  The speed is enough, 2,4 GHz, but I just don't know personally if that CPU is strong or too old. I am guessing it is pretty good, so you would be OK.   
---
The buildapc subreddit could also help find good deals on graphics cards, when you figure out the type you want.  If you post there, just say you know it's a Mac (not a  PC) but you want to ask for help buying a graph. card.
---
t 0.5 Doesn't come out until phase 5
---
I posted a dream you guys would have gotten a kick out of but one of the mods deleted it so.
---
Can shift + right click compare stats on items, that wasn't in original Vanilla if I remember correctly.
---
Its beyond everything else I have seen.
---
Thank you IT guy for making my day.
---
Search ‚Äúmountain skip‚Äù. There is a path just to the right of gnomergan where you can run up the mountain and fall to your death in wetlands. You then res at the graveyard at menethil.
---
I‚Äôm planning on doing the same but as human.
---
Except they are not getting early access
---
Streamer servers are a *very* legitimate concern. I have zero interest in being on a server where all anyone talks about it what one guy is doing. Hopefully Blizz releases server lists ahead of time to avoid this shit. 
---
But no, I don't care about them playing the beta.
---
25th..  just saying
---
Doesn't seem like you did? If no one kills a rare in one layer, it spawns I  another layer once the respawn timer has "ticked" twice? Meaning you'd have multiple rares up in the different layers, which you could hop between and kill.
---
I love classic, I have been raiding since 2004. But from my perspective retail is the much more competitive game in the end game. Running the same dungeons that just get easier over time in vanilla does not compete at all with mythic +‚Äôa that scale and change affixs, in raiding having bosses with more than one phase and 2 mechanics while juggling actual rotations rather than spamming frostbolt doesn‚Äôt compete, and PVP arena‚Äôs offer much more rewarding skill based combat than grinding 14 -16 hours a day to rank up.
---
Definitely think this is a bug. Trolls used to unequip then reequip gear to activate better berserking bonus.
---
Well I expect that people here on reddit who got the invite to come and share the bugs with us. Not that I'm gonna report the bugs without an invite and I sure as hell don't remember how vanilla used to be.
---
Also people can share bug reports here that streamers found or something.
---
Wetland run reverse... Dun Morogh -&gt; Loch Modan -&gt; Wetlands -&gt; Darkshore -&gt; Teldrassil
---
Did it involve a Tauren female??
---
Be a nerd and be damn proud of it! The gaming community can be toxic. Thankfully most meme-streamers have picked up most of them. But in general, the gaming community is one of the most amazing communities on earth.
---
Doesn't matter where you're from, how much money you have, how you look. People have damn fun anyway and connect with people all over the world.
---
multiple people report losing all keybindings and any settings changed in the settings menu upon disconnecting.
---
Some of the popular addons on private servers are:
---
Luna Unit Frames - a really nice unit frames pack bundled with mouseover heal and healcomms
---
Questie - shows you where (almost) all quests are located, a heretical addon for me because I want to explore a bit, no judging though
---
DPSMate - very complex combat log addon that tracks everything from heals, damage, casts, deaths etc. Logs are uploaded online and are very detailed. I especially like that you can see what people casted during the raid. As a class leader I find it much more helpful to see how many shadowbolts/corruptions etc. people cast instead of just the raw damage. I've yet to see two logs of the same raid uploaded by two different players that are identical though, or even close to identical, so it's not exactly reliable. I think the vanilla client just can't handle it, hopefully the 1.13 frankenstein Classic client will.
---
Aux - the BiS auctionhouse addon.
---
PoM Pyro mage was and is fun. That makes the Arcane spec not useless.
---
I'm aware of combining different talents from other specs (lol) but that doesn't change the fact that some specs are, objectively, poorly designed.
---
remove the flame pls
---
you underestimate the apes.
---
what do you even mean
---
Friend of mine:
---
Played wow 2005 in last year of primary school.
---
Playing wow 2019 going at the University "studying" for his PhD.
---
So technically still in school.
---
You could use WINE (it runs Windows programs on Macs) to run WoW.  It's an option, but I think using a native Mac WoW client is better - if you upgrade your card first.  A Mac client will run better. Sometimes Wine is a solution.   
---
Bootcamp is another option - but again, your graph. card might just be too old.
---
It involved blizzard doing a ninja release, me waking up in panic, me waking up realizing it was a dream, then me falling back asleep BACK into the dream.
---
That's how I feel for RP-PvP but my faith is drowning in anti-hype for each day =(
---
You will die a lot!
---
Dun Morogh to wetlands. Take to boat and walk. 
---
Or wait until a mage can make you a portal to darnassus. There will be no other way
---
I see dice I hit em.
---
Well, he was never subtle about not linking vanilla, so it's not a surprise
---
That bug has actually been there since actual vanilla :P
---
But, what happens if... a feral druid tries to log on?
---
This really isn't that unfeasible? I played when I was 9, am 24 now, and I think this is probably the case for quite a few people. Not everyone goes to Uni literally right out of Highschool, and there's some people doing 6/8 year degrees as well, or just changed their major.
---
I was 8 in 04‚Äô and just finished my degree in December. So I was close. But  I still have buddies older than me still in school. It‚Äôs the 5 year party baby.
---
70% in the UK... sub = ¬£9.99, token = ¬£17.
---
Shame
---
They do... it reduces the downtime between the mobs :).... but   ... everything is hunter gear :p
---
But the classic world is in a specific state, playing in a specific time. So it could be that I read something in the chronicle books that go past the time of classic and the first expansions, right?
---
awesome mate, thank you!
---
Make a Meme+
---
I would recommend backing down your dosage of adhd meds. Lol
---
\* shocked Pikachu face \*
---
It will stack like some cult over time, i hope blizzard will some day come and stomp this Classic+ thing to the ground.
---
Better go for TBC/WotLK than ruining a game many waited 15 years for.
---
Repeating, of course..
---
Lmao
---
Of course we should show clips of bugs, blizzard needs to see issues so that they can be fixed in time for release!
---
You would also have to be a moron to see the downsides of not using it. There wasnt a perfect solution here. Using sharding gives great server stability but has huge ramifications on classic community culture. No sharding or layering leaves you with massive Q times and the need for extra servers which will become Barron wastelands after all the tourists leave. They will then need to be merged and the existing community and economy get fucked. Layering gives you more stability, lower Q times and isn't immersion breaking being as they are server sized layers. After the population dies off a bit they can be removed and we end up with stable server communities. The only draw back is the possible exploitation players may use to jump from one layer to another via friend invites. This could be solved algorithmically to keep you on the layer with your friends to make it much harder to layer jump. 
---
There wasnt a perfect solution in the bunch. They all have drawbacks. Layering just has the least.
---
AddOns can easily replicate that anyway, what's the point of taking that out?
---
Source?
---
Sure but it‚Äôs maximum phase 1. And ony/Mc are instanced raids which means that you are bind to one instance as soon as one boss is killed so no exploit on this side.
---
My point is, let‚Äôs not be over dramatic about layering. It‚Äôs a really good compromise to manage frustration linked to the launch, and immersion.
---
Yep, then add fresh servers for people that want to replay it anew, and one day realize that a community can be split only so much. 
---
People hate CRZ  and sharding but seem not to know why it happened.
---
Wait so i end at Menethil, okay.  
---
But what then? How to get to the N811? Sorry, im not well informed :(
---
Following to know as well, I don't Game much anymore but am super stoked for classic hardcore.  I'm only looking to upgrade if I can't run classic at max settings/60fps constant in cities and raids.  Would love to know.
---
Who cares
---
What's your source for this?
---
Thank god we didn't have complete fucking morons like you prior to the recent hype, otherwise classic would be in a worse situation than it is now.
---
From IronForge you will have to run to Menethil Harbor in the Wetlands. It's not a bad run, except for the Wetlands you're not very likely to die. There's one spot that maybe someone else can pinpoint where you can jump off a cliff and die in the wetlands (Basically when you come out of one of the tunnels and can see down to the Wetlands) and rez at the GY and it shortens it a little bit. You may die a couple times in the Wetlands depending on where mobs are and if people are killing them. Then take the boat from Menethil to Auberdine and there was a short flight to Rut'Theran village outside Darnassus. 
---
There's a ton of guides in the other direction but you could jump off the boat near Menethil and die and shorten it more. Doesn't work the other way.
---
Just want you to bear in mind that as you are a warlock, you won't have access to your skills at all until you hit darnassus. Something to bear in mind. I would recommend maybe getting to the Darkshore level, and even going back and doing the Teldrassil questlines so you benefit from the reputation.
---
This is 100% bait.
---
I am gonna be leveling as dual wield melee Hunter 31/0/19.
---
Big benefit are high proficiencies on all weapons and defense during leveling. Making it best leveling build on pvp server.
---
They are in wrath and beyond, while the defias are neutral.
---
Warriors benefit from spirit gear in open world when grinding. Nice try tho
---
If you‚Äôre comparing leveling between BFA and classic obviously it‚Äôs ‚Äúharder‚Äù in classic as that was half the challenge of the expansion. However, in BFA the challenge is in the end game with mythic raiding and mythic +. Not sure how you can say raids are easy for the large part of the community when most people don‚Äôt even mythic raid let alone even finish heroic. Sure clsssic might have been difficult 15 years ago but now it‚Äôs relatively easy - it‚Äôs just a major time investment.
---

---
Rx580 8gb will run modern client wow like an emerald dream
---
too soon for that stuff probably. wait a few more weeks.   
---
1, its really soon.
---
2, LUA script guys who actually make addons need access to the beta so they can see what they need to do.
---
Not our fault they are giving it to any random youtuber and not accounts made during vanilla only.
---
There will be very little addons out right now as it's using the addon framework from Legion/BFA with stripped away features. I've heard that people have got 7.3.5 versions of Recount functioning but that's about the extent of it.
---
That was a scary moment.
---
Agree with the first point of "not having enough items available to build spec with" because thats the only reason alot of specs don't "work" until AQ comes out. Other than that, there isn't any useless spec, they just shine at different times. Some specs are good for PvP. Some for PvE and some you will have to wait until you have AQ 40 on farm. Survival hunters for example as you mention is actually the strongest spec for both PvE and PvP once you have full AQ 40 gear (0/21/30) same thing with prot pallies, it's an awesome PvP spec if you have gear for it and you can still tank some dungeons like strat and scholo with it.
---
oh lol ya got me
---
Can we get a source on that. Everywhere I saw it in the announced it said subscription was required to participate. But nowhere did it mention subscription was required to be invited to participate.
---
It's pretty much the requirements for Legion/BFA. Run that client on a trial version of the game and if it doesn't function, it's time to upgrade your rig.
---
Except it's the whole world
---
And each layer is the size of a small server
---
And it's not cross-realm
---
And it's temporary
---
But yeah other than that it's literally the same thing even though that's not what literally means
---
Thanks mate I will ask buildapc
---
'huh'
---
'huh' 'huh' 'huh'
---
Good point, wont do it form Level1 then. Thanks!
---
Super sick, mate. Already subbed.
---
They already stated that they can get more servers online if the population won't die down. My guess is that they have layering until Phase X and install new servers if they are needed.  
---
It seems the dev teams consensus on layering is that the tech is only needed for a smooth launch and they plan to switch it off
---
Because it doesn't add any new information. We currently know following:
---
- An almost 39 year old is watching
---
- A 35 year old is watching
---
And we assume that, obviously, everybody else is not watching. So, you saying that you're not watching doesn't give us anything.
---
Why would I go back to his garbage stream, dig through week old vods, watch him for hours until the fat fuck said what I heard he said, just to prove to a guy who is ignorant on this subject wrong?
---
If you want to look it up you can, go ahead.
---
sounds like if spirit gear drops and the healer needs it, it should go to them. if they dont, then it's fair game.
---
me personally, if a chest with +6spir dropped and I was wearing something with less and dps or tank needed it, they'd get kicked from group for sure.
---
It's gonna be painful for you. Leveling in Teldrassil means no Warlock/Demon Trainer. You gotta go back to another starting zone to get your training every 2 levels, so be prepped.
---
I honestly dont care about this dude
---
I never said anything about that not being ok.
---
Maybe we should start compiling a list of working addons?
---
Bingo. People are super impatient, you can see it in their faces, and while they are fighting a single mob. The twitch their character back n forth spamming A and D while deep sighing. These are the people that got into the beta......the same people that won't even be playing when it releases. They will try so hard though to like it, but they will crumble and run back to retail like a dog being kicked in the ass!
---
no it wouldnt. because checking the validity of the beta is a lot easier if you have a target (i.e. heroic strike should work this way when out of range/not facing mobs). with this, the devs get a suggestion on what exactly to test. it's not feasible to say "check everything in the entire 1
---
12 reference build"
---
yes, literally every single person knows that tipsout exist. Can you stop spamming links to his stream 30 times a day?
---
Link to that article when you post maybe. Or try to learn as much as you can first.   I would even call apple and ask them what type of cards you can upgrade to. They might say you need a card with X.   
---
Then post on the buildaPC subreddit.   Just my advice.   
---
Good luck.
---
Haha, why does it matter if hasnt played on a private server?
---
Why are people so butthurt over streamers getting beta? 
---
Is it really that hard to understand why?
---
I want my triangle cheeta when I play druid... Got to go fast
---
Well... Either way looks better then the new Sonic
---
lel
---
What's your setup like now man? I could probably tell you.
---
How do you do it in bed though? My bed is no where near my table, and living back would crook my head badly if trying to see the screen, and reaching the keyboard would suck .... The mechanics of the thing
---
no it absolutely wasn‚Äôt.
---
&gt; You want WoW Classic to succeed, yeah? So we need all the good advertisement we can get, even if you don‚Äôt agree personally with a certain streamer personality.
---
why do you click on the post then?
---
Class Checks out!
---
You know what beta means?
---
Its not for "Uhhh I got lucky and can play classic early yay", its for letting people in finding stuff thats wrong like "whoops, Molten Core Portal actually teleports you into Fireland dungeon instead" or "Whoops, elite guards in towns are level 120"...
---
You sound like one of those people who are just desperate to play and you probably wouldnt even report a single issue or bug and instead just play the game and use it as "early access".
---
Let the streamers test it, they have no job they can play 24/7 so we dont have to waste our limited time on a game where your progress wont even transfer over on release.
---
Let them waste their time and we will get a more fletched out game later on.
---
Very subjective matter. Some like better graphics, some wsnt the old ones.
---
I see where you're coming from.
---
My original post is about poor spec design choices, not spec balance.
---
I don't want Balance Druids to be as strong as mages, nor I ever said that. Only pointing out that some class specs are not designed to the point that is in fact one of 3 different flavors of the same class. If we agree that the original design for Balance druid was to be a "support" DPS spec, providing crit chance etc to other pure spell casters, then it should fulfill that same original design. I don't know enough Balance druids tho that's why I specifically talked about Survival hunters and Prot paladins.
---
horde clearing MC? haha good joke! xD  
---
^((i'm just kidding i'm horde too dont kill me pls))
---
print("let me play!")
---
shh, don't complain, you'll wake the gatekeepers
---
Maybe a single server wouldn't do harm but even doing that to cater to such a small part of the classic demographic might still be considered somewhat of a waste business wise. I had thought you meant initially the whole platform should have no layering.
---
Looks like the new announcement confirms better graphics.
---
So you need to be subbed to get in?
---
It is, indeed, an important matter. Not once I talked about streamers in servers not being a problem, and I'm sure Blizzard will release the server before-hand to compensate for that. But, again, I didn't mentioned any of the questions you raised.
---
It's because you haven't heard him talking about classic a few years ago. His views on Classic turned 180 pretty quickly. Personally I don't have anything against him, but check some of the stuff he posts on reddit, it's something I'd imagine a 12 y/o would comment here. People often call him a man child for a reason (tho I understand it must be hard dealing with all the negativity). I don't mind that he's in because obviously he's a big streamer and he's been grinding WoW for a long ass time, but I definitely agree that if he got in, Joana should be in aswell.
---
&gt; loads of bugs though.
---
not true at all
---
you've never seen a fury warrior in the devilsaur set and truestrike shoulders?
---
they also said sharding would be limited to starting zones and look at where we are now.
---
I actually alted druid on a few "other" servers and just didn't enjoy it as much as priest.  Having almost zero downtime is way too nice.
---
When hate is based on things that classic community actually enjoys it won't work.
---
Not even hots? Because literally everybody got one for hots.
---
This dude don't even have to base game installed
---
This is great. If I had money I would gild you.
---
\&gt;what is a shadow priest
---
Literally unplayable ez mode game now.
---
Downvote and move on, I guess.
---
Boohoo...
---
Yes, but I don't know what could count as a spoiler. 
---
According to the wiki Chapter IV: Old Hatreds, deals with the after math of the 3rd war up to the reopening of the dark portal. That's Vanilla's timeline so read up to that point I guess. Though as I said, Chronicle follows the revised lore and some of it might be different in vanilla.
---
Doesn't work
---
Thats a risk they always run, even if they ask for a subscription. Because there will be players who have a subscription for playing BfA that sign up but dont join the beta.
---
dude, pservers have years of vanilla emulation in them. classic is built on **legion**. there sure as hell is a lot on the pservers that works more closely to vanilla than current classic beta.
---
Got bored of wow after ghuun
---
Yes, the Heart of the Wild with 21 in resto spec is a true hybrid spec that lets you do everything as long as you have the appropriate gear
---
Reality should be by default what I want it to be
---
I really hope I do
---
Each layer is the size of a server ---&gt; can phase in and out of each layer ---&gt; server = realm ---&gt; thinking...
---
And its temporary for now. What if people dont quit? You think their gonna let 4x the recommended server cap on 1 server at a time? If they are just going to do que times after then whats the point in the first place?
---
I didn't mention class balance. 
---
I didn't say they are balanced or unbalanced. 
---
I said there are some specs there are, objectively, poorly designed.
---
Alright, thanks! :)
---
Wait, people are getting triggered by emoticons on reddit now?
---
Good thing there are no updated models then.
---
&gt; Having to read up on a boss for 3 hours and then still wipe 40 times because it's so much shit is just no fun. 
---
How do you say you like the difficultly of Vanilla, yet disregard the actually difficulty of retail?
---
I under if you prefer a certain type of gameplay that classic offers, but that does not make it more competitive which was the entire point of my post.
---
It's still there - it's just that some people that are currently streaming disabled the "modern" water since they prefer the older water textures.
---
Yeah when I used to (or when I get the chance) play all day long for extended periods of time I would very frequently, and right before going to sleep and close my eyes all I'd see would be images related to the game.
---
I'm not :(
---
It's not illegal but YouTube has the right to ban your account for hosting fraudulent giveaways.
---
Really? Just this morning, he was feat juggling two blackrock orcs. When the fear on one ended and the other was close, he feared the close one, causing the other one to stop being afraid, and run towards him. That's still only one fear.
---
Didn't that require walljumping (which does not exist in the modern classic client)?
---
Same reason you won't be able to get to the airfield above IF
---
Bears have two taunts, and are overall great for dungeons.
---
Everything is subjective.
---
In Vanilla if you turned in a quest with a quest reward you needed a free bag slot even if you were trading 1 quest reward slot for 1 item. In classic you don't need this slot and the two items swap.
---
Well, I stopped reading after
---
&gt;streamers are a great important part of a game ecosystem
---
and sort of skimmed the rest, but generally speaking we should welcome our new streamer overlords since they bring in their viewers, nay, their friends, in droves. Also elitism=bad.
---
Very much biased if the combat leveling was after you already leveled 1-40 as dagger.
---
getting pretty old school at this point. 8gb of ram,  Intel i5-2400 quad core at 3.10 ghz.  Nvidia GTX 560.    I wouldn't mind to upgrade the graphics card to something a little newer but don't wanna bottleneck it with the older i5 CPU
---
I sub for content patches typically these days because retail is a collector game now and there isn't much to do outside of that.
---
Played since Vanilla beta and no invite for me but I'm not expecting one anyway because I'm not some superstar youtuber
---
This is reddit, this would probably be better on the official forums. Reddit isnt owned by blizzard
---
yeah what exactly is this thread for? beta players who don't want to use the in-game feature?
---
TFW most replies are people explaining a meme...
---
This guy should have his beta access revoked.
---
Wait you are right. They don't have parry or block right? Because of no weapon and no shield.
---
But the different layer on server X are still server X. They are just copies/instances of that server.  
---
You won't merge with people from other servers, at least not in Classic. Think of it as channels (Guild Wars, Maple story, etc.)  
---
It sounds a lot like sharding/x-realm, but it isnt. You won't get randomly phased out or see people from other servers.
---
Yeah, tipsout is testing how things work in great detail based on a 400 bullet points list of things he want to test and filling bug reports.
---
Asmongold is just fucking around high on WoW nostalgia.
---
In general I think most beta participants are somewhat in between these two extremes!
---
&gt; Last I heard you could SPAM /sit and server lag might make it count as a crit and think you were standing so would pop the talents.
---
It's true https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI&amp;t=27
---
There were quite a few harsh critics on BfA features yet retail is in the position it is......
---
I'd consider this extremely low effort &lt;.&lt;

Hi, /u/actionring12

Sounds like hunter loot

12 years that's cute
---
Dunno if you have ever heard of day9, but about 10 years ago when he was streaming one of his podcasts, he talked about being a nerd. He talked about how people aren‚Äôt happy by trying to hide the fact they love video games and how he struggled with it as well. 
---
Eventually he realized that video games are something he is passionate about and he shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed of something that makes him so happy. This was a great podcast for me, because I had always hidden the fact that I loved video games. I played a ton of sports, was always successful in school and have a successful career. But it wasn‚Äôt until recently that I came out of the closet as an avid ‚Äògamer‚Äô
---
Yes and also make em start at lvl 55. Nochanges
---
No wall jumping or any special jumping required.
---
This won‚Äôt work if blizzard decide to change the terrain before release. But I don‚Äôt see why they would as it was something you could do back in vanilla.
---
i kno dis is joke but isnt layering basicly the same as multiple servers that when low pop will be merged?? Just that they share the same name which makes it less difficult and "immersion" breakin when mergin
---
OhGee, Monkeynews and Perplexity are the only real dawgs. All the rest are just personalities but lack the immaculate and ridiculously in-depth knowledge and skills.
---
Something something pink hair and lots of cleavage.
---
normal person: "look there is a ship!"
---
blizzard shill: "thats a boat, not a ship. blizzard said so. totally different thing!"
---
Words cannot express how much I love this.  The level of 'almost legit' attention to detail (eg the request and response diagrams) combined with the exaggerated frustration.
---
A+ beautiful
---
This is definitely something I'd love to listen too, I'll find it. Many thanks for sharing!
---
I really hope they don‚Äôt remove such insignificant yet so useful things like this. Why on Earth would someone be against this?
---
OH HELL NO!
---
No, but it maybe justifies some of the hate.
---
This is a comment my grandpa would write about games.
---
But it doesn't matter does it? 
---
People who've cleared Naxx in Classic have a huge reputition. Everyone knows that deserves respect and everyone who wasn't able to clear Naxx **never killed KT**.
---
Now on retail you can just lfr the whole content. Sure, the same content in mythic is way harder and the equip you get is better, but who cares? Everyone has killed every boss and every raid. There's nothing special anymore, no legendary bosses or raids or fights. You killed boss X on mythic+? Ah nice, well I also killed him, but in lfr. 
---
And I think that is meant with easy play. You can essentially play the whole content on easy mode by just using lfr. Who cares if someone else played it on a harder difficulty? You've seen it all anyway and you got the same equip pieces, just with lesser gear score.
---
This is no flame, just how I see it. Some killed KT, I don't have to ask on what difficulty, I know he's done some hard shit. Someone killed every boss since WOTLK up to BFA? Well, who didn't?
---
report is as a bug. this is why there is a beta.
---
Literally every one of my friends are against min maxing. I have a feeling the folks that are into speed leveling and world firsts, they will probably be bored of the game awfully quick.
---
I mean they would of had to start playing in 1st-3rd or grade if they went straight to college after high school. 
---
It's possible that they went to college later in life I suppose.
---
Then the mods will remove it.
---
Would have
---
Often. In fact, last night I dreamt I had just gotten my lvl 60 mount. I was moving so god damn fast! Alas, in reality thatll probably not happen till mid 2020
---
Proof?
---
We should rename this subreddit to r/TipsOut
---
This is bait.
---
Looks cool but I don't think the lightning makes a lot of sense, as he is a fire elemental
---
Wait, you need to be subbed to get an invite?... brb.
---
Even though models arent gonna be updated, its still gonna be little weird now playing Classic on wide screen monitors :)
---
He did the same in darkshore, but the 2nd mob bugged out, kept being feared and he sperged out about it
---
I laughed may too hard at this
---
I would hate making more than professionals each month just for playing videogames, who am I kidding I envy them a lot .
---
Esfand has 4k+ subs  , asmon has 8k after his long pause , multiply that x2,5 and that's what they make before taxes . Not counting donations on top of that
---
Right? Thats exactly what i feel like im arguing against right now xD
---
Yeah add Demon Hunters too so we don't have to see Nixxiom RP as one as a night elf warrior.
---
It‚Äôs obvious from your comments you are extremely biased towards and have definitely not done any high end raiding in the recent expansions as you think the only prep is reading boss guides. Also 40 wipes is absolutely nothing as the most recent mythic boss took one of the best guilds 730 wipes.
---
I enjoy down-voting stupid posts like these.
---
This guy is playing private servers.  
---
He said this in another comment:   
---
&gt; I streamed the 2nd test up to level 32 where I just simply couldn't brain questing anymore and grinded to 40.   
---
This is all on private servers. His Youtube channel is all stuff done days or weeks ago.  
---
And no, he doesn't have a level 40 in the beta.
---
WeirdChamp
---
I started early 2005, its just that I havent let my sub run out since late 2007.
---
No idea whats cute about that, but okay.
---
There have been a lot of Critism about my statement, Guess what? I'm right and youre wrong and you donting wnat Dks in the game because they are better tand take more skill than you noob classes, stay mad and say no, but I will make this happen, i will start a petition to add dks in the game and you will see what happenes when I come in as a dk and gank you. end of story, also if dk is so bad, proof?
---
Some of us also gave a good try to the "get out for the sake of getting out" thing. 
---
Been there, done that for most of my twenties. I'm just happier defaulting to the quieter nerdier lifestyle I had in HS, except now I know for sure I won't be missing out on these things.
---
Separate server so no muling / twinking.
---
I got an invite to beta! How many people got one? Servers seem low population.
---
*NO.*
---
Love rockets werent in vanilla
---
#nochanges failed about a year ago. Where have you been?
---
No because each layer will have one server worth of population, therefore each layer has one server worth of hardcore speed levelers, that will compete for each layer.
---
So if a server has 3x layers, it also has 3 times as many hardcore levelers that would then compete for devilsaur.
---
It all equalises in the end. Stop complaining.
---
Veteran here. Only the greasiest of neck beards care about shit like this.
---
So if a server has 3 layers, it also has 3 times as many hardcore levelers that would then compete for devilsaur.

---
No dungeon finder.. Pls
---
There are DKs in Naxx.
---
Well, boats and ships *are* different things. A pistol isn't the same as an assault rifle just because they're both guns. What point are you trying to make..?
---
Me too. Screw Gordon Gekko. Need all the way!
---
I guess someone is going to create an add on copying the original version
---
‚ÄòHumanly‚Äô I see what you did there
---
i did report it in game. I only questioned it as you not only see it when you ding but under your skills tab it also shows it in the UI so was strange.
---
I never used the word competition once and disagreed with you saying that live is strictly higher difficulty. It's a different difficulty (reflexes &amp; complexity vs punishing tuning and working with ressources(mana) and threat) but I prefer the old one and don't care about competition in WoW (if I want competition I play Counterstrike or similar).
---
Since you brought competition up as a reply to my post, I think it's fair for me to say that I don't like how Blizzard decided to do difficulty after TBC
---
Wtf! Retail is still an option.
---
Exactly what I was going to say. I don‚Äôt see many parents allowing their 7 year old to play a game they have to pay monthly for but I guess we all have seen those news stories of the 5 year old who is addicted to fortnight so it is possible.
---
Ignoring everything else you guys are talking about, wireless peripherals are seriously the meta right now. Logitech GPro Wireless is one of the best mice currently available (assuming you dont need 20 buttons on your mouse for some stupid reason). The responsetimes are nothing like you think they are anymore, u should look into it!
---
Watching streamers briefly last night they have no clue what to report and not report.
---
They‚Äôre kiting mobs across the world and then writing big reports that it‚Äôs evading...
---
And I believe Shroud have been playing on vanilla pservers.
---
Yeah, and like I posted elsewhere, this is only a problem if you have one or two people on the *entire server* doing this. So sure, it's a problem for maybe a day or two regarding those first few people to hit Un'Goro. Okay. But as soon as other nolifers catch up they will all be trying the same thing and there'll be no advantage to layer hopping.
---
Dont burn yourselves out.  Nothing in beta will persist to live.
---
Queue the cries of censorship and blizzard "becoming the thjng they swore to destroy" edgelord posts

Spirit is great for leveling, less downtime, everyone needs it.

You can show yourself as ''Offline'' through bnet  **( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)**

Well let the Nabes come.

Coulnd‚Äôt you change the text font? And make it bigger?

wow just wow, what happened to #nochanges? Literally unplayable and ruined right now

Bullshit, chuck norris cant die

My problem is more the , "wait up guys, my mouse needs a recharge" or the " ok tank swap in 3, 2,. ....... "

That was kind of just a joke, but in general emoticons are not used on most of reddit. There are some subreddits that use it, but it is kind of seen as a "facebook / instagram / whatever" thing. I don't really think many people actually get triggered by it, but it more like the etiquette writing on most subs that you write without emoticons. You can do it if you like, but take a look at most post - no one uses emoticons.
---
I don't really care myself either, but I have to admit that I think it looks a bit "misplaced". Not for any logical reason except it is not the norm - still, I don't care if you use it really.
---
Does that effect the guild status though?
---
I had a friend in high school like him. He is just fucking around. Yeah it can get under peoples skin (as my friend did, quite often) but hes not serious. He is just as hard on himself a lot of the time
---
Moron
---
Damage is ok.
---
He's jumping to not get hit on his back + Daze is greatly reduced against player lower than lvl 30.
---
Hello.
---
He's not even lvl 10, wtf are you complaining about, ofc firsts levels are easy...
---
Two people against a single mob, not even an elite, what did you expect?
---
Here is some literature from Wow Wiki : 
---
 Like elite mobs, rare mobs have a dragon around their portrait; however, unlike elites, this dragon icon is silver and lacks a wing on the side. They can also be elite, in which case the wing is present. 
---
 Rares are sometimes erroneously referred to as "silver elites." However, unlike [elite](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Elite) mobs (which have a gold dragon around their portrait), rare mobs are generally **not** tougher than normal mobs of the same level. Rare mobs typically have comparable health and [DPS](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/DPS) of a mob their level, but tend to have an extra skill or two.
---
Second hand info, but people have been saying that blizzard confirmed that.
---
I just think you overstate the importance, streamers are a fad driven eco-system. Nothing lasts forever, the success of vanilla WoW is going to be based on the passion that has existed long before twitch was even a blip for classic servers.
---
l-o-l; no.
---
This is surely not the Queen's English!  But from what I can decipher, I get a golden retriever upon logging in.  Yes, I'm sure of this.
---
So I explained you perfectly and it triggered you? rip :), down vote if I'm right.
---
You can only get to level 30 in the beta right?
---
You‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges.
---
Kargoz makes leveling guides for all classes, while Joanas gives speed run guides. They are both good in their niche.
---
Frost gives gold farming, professions guides, and secret grind spots.
---
They have their own niche that make your understanding complete for the game.
---
A lot more people than you think started with their siblings/parents as small kids, barely understanding what went on. Now they're here because they want to play the game they never truly understood but remember fondly nonetheless. :D
---
were eu beta invites not given out yet ?
---
:(
---
no doomhammer and stockade pauldrons 0/10 not my warchief!
---
BC is god tier.
---
I mean.. there's so few people that got access to the beta it doesn't really matter. Wait for the first stress test weekend and we might get an idea.
---
I understand that, dude, but emulators rely on guesswork, videos and patch notes. Some things will not be right without the official database to check values.
---
Classic uses the actual client, that's it. Its core is based on official values from old data from Blizzard. Of course it could be some discrepancies, but I would not consider it less reliable than private server's emulation.
---
&gt; there sure as hell is a lot on the pservers that works more closely to vanilla than current classic beta. 
---
Doubtful, but I admire your appreciation for pservers.
---
More like TBC... when the horde got corrupted. Sad Times. :D
---
So, a lot of people spend nine years in college.
---
Yeah... They're called doctors.
---
Can't say for sure, but I'm guessing it affects the guild status as well. Offline mode is specifically made so you can kinda ''chill solo'' without any questions. Leaving guild status out of that kinda defeats the purpose, I assume.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking meme people....fuck.
---
I know this is bait and all, but I managed to never level a deathknight even though I played all the way to BFA before quitting and waiting for classic.
---
On paper they seem badass and stuff, but I just could not level one past 55 lol. I made like 4 different death knights and stopped before 56 each time haha and I don't even know why because their spells were pretty cool and stuff.
---
wow cinematic that looks way better than the warcraft movie did.
---
^ has already been tested.
---
Leveling dungeons are not the same as endgame dungeons.
---
it's not my appreciation for pservers, it's my dislike for legion
---
I stopped exactly at the same point lol. Nothing against them but I don't see why I should care about them at all.
---
Retail is balanced, but also all classes have the same button with different names and animations. No changes.
---
Yeah its not a big deal but still different so thought it was worth pointing out.
---
what about t0?
---
But bnet is across multiple games and many of them don't have guilds right? I am not subbed, can't check
---
Not every sub gets into the beta but everyone who gets into the beta must have an active sub
---
I should bind the link of the Rare mob Wow Wiki page a one of my keyboard key, that would avoid me to copy past it every two post...
---
 However, unlike [elite](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Elite) mobs (which have a gold dragon around their portrait), rare mobs are generally **not** tougher than normal mobs of the same level. Rare mobs typically have comparable health and [DPS](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/DPS) of a mob their level, but tend to have an extra skill or two.
---
Graphics don't even matter, classic or updated as long as the gameplay is good
---
This.  Everyone should be a fury warrior with engineering.
---
They should also add blood elf, dranei, goblin, worgen and pandas. As a third faction called failure starting zone stv.
---
Ya but look like if you just go ahead and ignore all externally conflicting information and focus just in THIS THREAD, then youll see that hes actually right and knows what hes talking about. /s
---
Reminds me of politics
---
Found the ret Paladin who never got invited :(
---
People will try out different classes to get a feel for them. Warriors are notoriously ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù to level, and I would assume people would want to see how frustrating that actually is. Numbers will be meaningless for the time being.
---
Yikes..........troll much? Nice bait
---
oh the classic stop complaining shit. only becoz you can't grasp the situation because you lack the knowledge and experience doesn't mean everyone has to shut off his brain.
---
a group of nerds will rush to 60, team up and farm a fortune while hopping layers.
---
Hmm im not worried about that im worried about a fractioned or sharded if you prefer, server community. Id rather have que times then sharding any day. I sincerely hope blizz gives u what u want but i also hope they give me and people like me an option to have no sharding whatsoever.
---
Sharding is, in my honest opinion, what killed off retail the most and i dont want classic to be dead on arrival. Plus, if im wrong and you + blizz are right, then giving an option wont hurt anyone except ppl like me who have to reroll to the formerly sharded servers to have a playerbase.
---
I am willing to bet theres more then enough a community like me though that would rather wait in ques then have sharding.
---
only sub you CANNOT receive beta invite without subscription
---
I know they're instances. But if people *are* raising in phase 1, which I think they will be, then people will definitely, *definitely* be exploiting every angle they can. The main downside here is a completely busted economy. Which will cause a lot of frustration and hurt immersion.
---
As if some of these 'Testers' will report something
---
I think you‚Äôre exactly right. Besides, this sub has been gaining traction over the past year, so I have to imagine many of those people are still subbed. I for one definitely won‚Äôt be getting a beta invite haha
---
As I said in the other comment, Classic uses only the client from retail. Core mechanincs are based on vanilla.
---
My precious!!!!
---
no, the core = engine is based on legion. only the database is classic. besides, as a tester you want people to report specific things to you so you have something to test. let's take two scenarios:
---
a) pserver player writes a bug report: "warrior HS gets de-selected when out of range of a mob for more than 2 sec, that shouldn't be"
---
b) Boss comes along and says: "test the classic beta for any differences to our 1.12 reference cliebt"
---
which one do you think yields more results?
---
I personally started playing wow in 2005 (eu release)  when I was 9. It's also pretty common to take a few years off to work before going to university where I'm from.
---
Classes are balanced. Specs are not meant to be.
---
Everyone in this thread is probably not even in the beta.
---
If you're in the beta, you'd use the in-game bug report.
---
95% of these posts are from people watching streams.
---
"why does Blizzard want free marketing"
---
...and blizzard have the source of vanilla because they make the game or do you think they throw all game ver. in the trash after TBC/WOTLK/CATA/PANDARIA/WOD/LEGION/BFA has released??? And classic is built on classic (not on legion). They only had to upgrade the client to actual database (wow retail format). So, if the actual classic have a "regen bug", just report, stop "meaning"  that pservers players are smart than game devs. Blizzard have Nostalrius team on their side
---
I wish it was the case. I'd resub if they sent me a beta ticket. But I'm not going to sub for an essentially 0% chance to get into the beta.
---
I don‚Äôt understand wtf I‚Äôm looking at
---
Good point, a lot of people go out because they feel like they should and don't actually have a good time!
---
no, core mechanics are part of the engine and thus ported over from legion.
---
So facebook has even stolen emoticons now?
---
And i am sorry but i wont stop using them, they are a great way of conveying emotion in speech.
---
If i write "wtf are you doing?" it seems a lot more harsh than if i write "wtf are you doing? :D"
---
laughing at all the people who subscribed and didn't get in
---
yep, correct
---
I'm not convinced the values are correct, but even if they were the amount the player misses (especially when attacking higher lvl mobs) is definitely not right, no doubt in my mind there is something wrong there.
---
As long as there‚Äôs no funny business!
---
Lol I thought the same thing last night. Especially streamers with less than 500 viewers. They were baiting like craaazy!
---
Don't tell em, it'll just cause confusion.
---
I saw less but there are some
---
I just don't see the point in all of those threads about bugs. There is literally a megathread about bugs, why do we need all of these extra threads filling up the frontpage? They serve no purpose and most of them are just people that can't remember anything from vanilla and think they found a bug because it was different on a pserver they once played.
---
I do. Instead of having to talk to the other player - initiate a conversation and ask for an invite, you just compress that into a button click. In my opinion, one of the key things that made old WoW great was the community. And in order to have that there has to be incentive to interact with other players in order to build it.
---
He doesnt strike people who steal his content and put it on youtube, and some of those react channels are getting 100k+ views.  So now there are like 10+ channels trying to cash in on it and upload his content minutes after he streams it.
---
It's not poor design. It's brilliant design. It means there are wrong choices and right choices. The alternative to that is "there are no wrong choices, just do what you want", that's not super appealing. It's repulsive.
---
‚ÄúA lot of people go to college for 8 years.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre called doctors.‚Äù
---
Not sure why I would be triggered it just came off as a very cringe comment from someone who obviously is pretty old and isn‚Äôt good at games anymore. Most people who got into the beta met certain requirements  and therefore would probably play classic when it comes out as well.
---
Exactly! I'll be in school again next year (uni) but that's because I took 3 years off to travel, work a little and just do other things while figuring out what I want to study. 
---
Of course, I was still a young kid when I played Vanilla which is why I personally say I didn't play, as I didn't fully understand what I was doing and I only got to lvl 8 I think, but that's another story.
---
There is an option for models that are in between Classic and new. Or at least there was in the Demo from Blizz con.
---
a) Blizz doesnt have nost devs on their side
---
b) classic is built on legion core
---
c) they have a finished 1.12 reference client, but they need things to check. they can't just check "everything"
---
there was only like 150 players online yesterday. everyone on the server that i've talked to is either a streamer or youtuber, OR a a OG day 1 player that participated in the blizzcon demo and had an active sub
---
How long have you played/been subbed?
---
You might be able to glean something off of faction and maybe even racial distribution, but definitely not class. Either way the sample size is super small. It looked like there was maybe 100 people playing yesterday.
---
At least from what I could see.
---
Guess I'll sub again, me and gf quit playing retail because classic hype and yarrharr servers got our attention. So guess we'll just chill with retail and getting them void elves again =)
---
It's a worthy sacrifice for classic beta.
---
then it's pretty pointless right?^^
---
Why are you here? Go back to r/WoW
---
Some guy is saying his friend got in without an active sub but that directly contradicts what blizz stated, so I'd be surprised if that were true.
---
I hope I'm wrong and when I go boot up my PC in 10 minutes that I have beta access, but basically 0% chance.
---
Alright =(
---
Welll I was 8ish when Classic came out, didn‚Äôt actually start untill BC when I did stuff with my dad. 
---
Finishing up college atm, so yes unfortunately in school during nuclassic. Basically what Eroscasa said, I had fun then but i‚Äôm really excited to be able to raid and play classic on my own terms.
---
That's the thing, you need an entire guild on your level to experience end game, so..nah, theres way too much to do as a solo player to prep in the meantime.
---
Just coming here to say exactly this! üòÇ
---
I agree, this thread is pointless.
---
I don't understand why this guy's getting downvoted.  OP's post basically opened up conversation about older age groups watching Twitch.  This guy simply responded that he's in that older group, but he's still not watching.  He participated in the topic at hand and got downvoted...why?  Because his personal opinion isn't the same?  That's not how the upvote/downvote system works people.
---
I'm not going to let this keep me up at night until we see how easy/hard it is in practice. They could sneak in some stopgaps to jumping layers every XX minutes. 
---
Plus they confirmed that a layer is the same capacity as a full vanilla server. So you could be jumping from one full layer to another, that also has farmers on it.
---
ROFL the fucking layering monster
---
Not the same people...
---
I played in 05/06, I was in 5th grade 
---
I also should've graduated already, so ... Prob not the best person to base this on lmaoo
---
Thank you eric draven
---
Hi, /u/Onewaye21
---
Fair enough, my post was about the endgame competition aspect I‚Äôm not comparing the causal leveling aspects of each version.
---
Sorry for the misunderstanding! I love both versions of the game and they are different, just take a bit of exception to those that try and say that retail has no difficultly while avoiding the content that is actually difficult.
---
This post... yikes
---
Safety not guaranteed, I've only done this once before
---
My observation was through Asmon‚Äôs stream. My source of it existing in Vanilla is my own experience
---
Those with serious guilds will be starting their attunements and whatnot the moment they hit 60. There's plenty of reasons to push to max level asap.
---
You forgot 'actually playing classic, just on a private server'.
---
I subbed and got no invite, the opposite :(
---
I agree with you.  Retail isn't hard.  It's just more time-consuming and cumbersome.  It's not as if leveling up takes strategy or tactical foresight - you just can't faceroll.
---
I'm not going into DM worried about gearing up the healer. Sorry.
---
Thankfully I lost interest in TBC and moved on with my life. Now I‚Äôm out of school and ready to ruin myself with Classic!
---
this is a low tier meme even for this sub
---
This. My younger brother is 21, still in college and is excited for classic because his first memories of gaming was watching me play vanilla. He was 5 or 6 at that point and I let him make his own character to mess around with at times. He's played more WoW than me in recent years and he's so excited to finally get a real look at the original game he fell in love with as a child.
---
a lot of people had older siblings. i started when i was 8 because my brother made an account for us. didnt really understand what the fuck i was doing until tbc, tho
---
They briefly answered this question in an interview, beta tester will be able to transfer their char to the official servers when classic is released so keeping their ign, they'll get a tabard as well as a title and a companion for those who reach lvl 30 in beta.
---
And a free mount at lvl 60 + thunderfurry
---
Some of us didn‚Äôt do school until mid to late 20s ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I literally don't care about this. I also don't care about the option to use more present day graphics, or that items aren't going to be released with staggered itemization, or any of these small insignifcant changes that people whinge about.
---
Especially this one, because its probably 99% likely that its just something they didn't remove and it'll be gone by release.
---
I swear to god I have never heard of someone using stone as a measurement. But you learn something new every day I guess
---
ncie troll kid downvoted!
---
Right here dude!!!
---
I‚Äôm playing a Druid for the stealth and utility as well.
---
You don't really speak for everyone though. I played WoW the day it launched in 2004 religiously up until sometime in Cataclysm.  I'm over 30. With that said, I enjoy some streamers.  At my age, a lot of my IRL friends don't really play video games anymore, so having a chill stream on and a chat to interact with while I game is fun. I've met some cool people to play games with through Twitch. It's not so bad.
---
What amazes me is someone like Staysafe who is supposed to be a classic guy and has some sort of speed running plan, and he's objectively bad at it.  Not life tapping while moving, not making any min/max timing decisions.  Waiting until his pet auto aggros from defensive stance.   It's hard to watch people who are mediocre at best at this game stand at the top of the community.  I hope actual pros take over streaming once more people are playing the game.
---
Played since vanilla. I've subbed and unsubbed a lot. I currently have a subscription.
---
Did he report it?

Ok, maybe I misunderstood how they recreated Classic mechanics on the actual client. But I don't think they just based Classic on data, problably there's some adjustements client side.
---
I'd took the latter. IMO in the former scenario it'd be faster to just rely on the player's information, but to get the right mechanic it'd be necessary to compare with 1.12.
---
I think most of the "somewhat" famous streamers will play on PvE Servers because they know otherwise it will be impossible for them to level
---
I'm just explaining the general way of writing is different on reddit. Instead of using emoticons to get the point across people instead just formulate the sentence so that it get the point across from the actual words.
---
Also, a really big part of reddit is discussions and sarcasm. Personally I think both of those are better without emoticons, simply because I see no reason for it in a discussion (most of the subs I visit are factual, not emotional) and sarcasm is more fun to me if it is subtle - slapping a ;) smiley on there is like explaining a joke - ruins it for me.
---
&gt;And i am sorry but i wont stop using them
---
Well, as I said I don't really care, so not sure why you apologise to me. I'm fine with it (as long as you don't ruin sarcasm, that's where I draw the line).

My younger sister used to watch me play all sorts of Nintendo games as well as The Sims. 
---
I remember Sims especially. She never had a clue how to play but she enjoyed making a character and I would tell her what her character was up to and how she was doing. 
---
I'm trying to get her to play Classic with me. She still plays games with me occasionally and she loved Borderlands 2. I think Classic would be the perfect Coop experience. She loves that phat loot! :D
---
Thats entirely not true ma'am

Already posted.

I am not sure, we can always find it in the current vod of his current stream

When I played video games I was a hard min-max type of guys. Now, my entire levelling journey will probably revolve around World PvP. I‚Äôve written a little guide for myself, sure, but it mainly has to do with things like Inventory Management, Grinding (when &amp; how), Bank Alt, general rules, etc. When I hit the actual world, I‚Äôll be adventuring, socialising and PvPing, immersion and fun &gt; leading the server. I‚Äôll probably invest some time to get a cool piece of gear at lvl 25 or 30 if it means being a badass for a bit, even if its completely nonsensical from the levelling perspective. 
---
I definitely get the min-max crowd though. There‚Äôs a type of person that has to do this with things they‚Äôre serious about- if I didn‚Äôt have a different outlet these days I‚Äôd probably do the same.
---
Yeah, I hate sharding too. But you have to stop pretending it's the same thing. It just isn't. It's a good compromise to a problem with no one good solution. When you increase the scale on a sharding to this point, the negative effects are going to be greatly diminished. A handful of layers is *so* much better than hundreds of shards. I honestly don't think you're even going to notice layering happening that much at all.
---
There sure will be a lot of people that prefer one solution (like queueing) to the other. But this is a *new* solution that hasn't been tested yet and yet people have decided that it's going to ruin the game instantly, it's just silly. Wait and see. If somehow a server is still at twice the expected capacity (any more is completely unrealistic) by the time phase 2 is rolling around, then we can be concerned with Blizzard's possible solutions, all of which are going to be previous solutions that they're trying to avoid with layering.

He likes it retard easy where one player can fuck up and wipe the raid. Which outside of a few fights, isn‚Äôt very prevalent in Vanilla when you can 20man most raid content outside of Naxx (I think he forgets this). He also ignores that the fundamentals of most bosses now are ‚Äúspread/stack when needed, stay out of the bad stuff, dispel properly, don‚Äôt be dumb‚Äù, which is exactly what it was in Vanilla too.
---
I think he did, just not right at launch.
---
This affects gameplay slightly. I'll start a warrior and level, then realize that its slightly stupid so ill move my rogue up 2 spaces to the top and boom. Another lowlife ganker has been born. Can't wait.
---
Streamers are fine, man.  I have no interest in watching streamers, but that's fine - I don't have to like everything.  Plenty of people do like streamers.
---
My only beef with streamers/content creators is that game devs are starting to show them favoritism and/or make them their de facto PR department.  I don't like that.

Upping stack size though _is_ a gameplay change.

It affects the value of the bags and influences the economy.

If the players don't need that much of a bag space, they won't be that inclined to buy/sell this low-level 6/8/10-slot bags.

They said it would be used for a limited time from the beginning.  They never said it would be limited to starting zones.
---
Except there's another group of nerds on other layers trying to do the same thing.
---
There isn't and there wasn't.
---
Classic uses the modern engine and some things come with that "free", so Blizzard left it in. The most notable are modern shadows, water and increased ground clutter view distance. But the models, textures, animations, effects, etc. are all Vanilla.

Good job. Using tbc talents tho since you are casting vampiric touch.

I've done this on a PServer. 
---
- Level to 6 in the gnome starting zone. Get level 6 spells and imp. 
---
- Run to menethil harbour (in wetlands) and get the boat. 
---
- Do the complete starting nelf zone. At some point you have to run to Darn, do this when you are level 10. Set your hearth there and run all the way to stormwind for new spells and voidwalker quest. 
---
- Keep leveling in nelf zones going back every 4 levels for spells
---
Its wrong to a degree though.  Those things died because something that is similar but better came along.  If Twitch dies, it will be because something a better streaming platform comes along. Not because streaming just dies like you are hoping.
---
I would say the intended audience are old players who quit. WoW subs peaked at the end of 2010 with over 12 million, and has been in decline ever since. Now Blizz doesn't even want to publish numbers lol, I've seen reports as low as 1.7 million active subs today but no one really knows. 
---
I will honestly be shocked if classic doesn't overtake retail in popularity. It's just my opinion but I think classic is the better game. I used to love WoW so much and can't wait to come back, and I know I'm not alone.
---
Oh no /u/Ventez, I love flavor streamers for what they are, day in, day out, I tune in, catch their scoops and takes etc.  I'm just starting that we should all remember what closed beta testing is traditionally for, and it's not world firsting anything
---
I read through 2 years of your comments and didn't see you mention August.

Not sure if that was a pun regarding the latest episode
---
I have the Gpro wireless and it goes about 2weeks without charging, 12+hours on the PC. For comfort, go into your BIOS and enable USB charging when the pc is off so you plug it in over night :) Also, plugging it in for like 10 minutes charges it for about 30-60minutes so it really isnt a big deal

Slippery slope fallacy*

the point is, people hate ships (sharding) because they make them seasick. blizzard comes and says, "ah, so you hate ships? no problem, we got you! there is a boat (layers)!"

Don't bother.  At best you'll get a stress test invite, which is extremely limited duration.  Just be patient and wait till August 27th to re-sub.
---
If I get in the beta I will play Ally to not burn myself on the Horde zones that I know by heart, and I will probably not play the class I want to roll at release either ... so you can't really make any conclusions about beta pop, since I guess a lot of people will do like me.
---
yep. november 23 2004 checking in

Man, I completely forgot about degaussing.
---
Classic will *most likely* be less demanding than the Vanilla client, at least on Windows. It's based on the modern client with all the improvements all the while using only Vanilla assets.
---
Of course how it runs on Mac can be different but I still expect it to run better than Vanilla.
---
See this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQ8w46JOL4
---
Like i said then jusy give the players an option. Remember blizz's "you think you do but you dont" when ppl asked for classic? You think ppl just sitting back and accepting that helped make classic a reality? This is the exact time we have to let our voices be heard so we dont end up with a fked up game like retail. Blizz doesnt seem to understand what any of their playerbase wants and i want classic to succeed because i loved vanilla. If we let them get away with this shit we are going to end up with a literal reskinned version of retail and thats what i want to avoid the most. So like i said before, give us an option. Theres no downside to blizz doing this except they dont wanna be proven wrong by having the sharded realms dead and the ones that were never sharded thriving.
---
But hey at least if this keeps up and blizz kills classic like they did with retail we will have an updated client for the next big private server wooo
---
Things have changed! Last time I had a wireless mouse was like 2010 and it only held up for 6 or so hours. When I played for longer than that in a single stretch.
---
Well as usual they seems to think beta as advertisement rather than actual beta test. I think that requirement for getting key is that you actually fill some kind of form of what you've noticed while testing. Now they just give keys to streamers who randomly play game and don't even bother testing it. For streamers it's just way to get money if they stream game that is very anticipated.
---
mekkatorque heroic has more mechanics than entire raids in vanilla idk what youre talking about saying ‚Äúsimilar difficulty‚Äù
---
the firs thing you do, when you start a fresh game , is go trough the settings anyway.

So i dont think it realy maters anyway.

^(Also im playing with modern graphichs)

Classic will most likely be less demanding than the Vanilla client, at least on Windows. It's based on the modern client with all the improvements all the while using only Vanilla assets.

However if you can't run BfA that likely means you won't be able to run Classic either, sorry.

Im more interested in the warrior charge that happens a few seconds after - could warriors charge around objects in vanilla?

I haven't played seriously since Wrath, and not at all since early Cata (I didn't even get all the way to 85).  Some of these changes blow my mind.

I kinda want youtubers to get access so they could... use that to make videos

Many multiboxers reported having 3x better fps on the demo than they do on retail. Everything being low poly makes a much bigger difference than you‚Äôre making it out to.

Not sure if you‚Äôre delusional or have never done an end mythic boss? Don‚Äôt even know how to comprehend you saying vanilla bosses are harder than retail.

There's a way to get decent DPS out of feral, but you should know that it requires a very weird playstyle that some people won't enjoy. Basically, there's two mechanics to explain:
---
1) [Wolfshead Helm](http://classicdb.ch/?item=8345) gives you 20 energy when you shift into cat form, similar to the Furor talent. They stack and you end up gaining 60 energy upon shifting. You have to switch in and out of cat form constantly and time it carefully between energy regen ticks. If you misjudge your mana and you don't have enough left to switch into cat form, your DPS drops to basically 0.
---
2) [Manual Crowd Pummeler](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449) is an item with three charges of a buff that increases attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds. You have to keep the weapon equipped throughout the duration. This then becomes the BiS weapon for feral DPS, and you have to farm quite a few of them from Gnomeregan for each raid. Basically enough to have 100% uptime throughout every boss fight, with each pummeler providing 90 seconds.
---
As you can see, it's a very bizarre playstyle that takes way more work and attention than any other "rotation" in vanilla, and it involves using weird low-level items so you never really get the new weapon feel. If you can live with these things, and the fact that you're still not gonna be more than adequate DPS, then go ahead. But you should know what you're getting into because it's definitely an acquired taste.
---
Uh, how is that not a bug? Server should not trust client so much.
---
Av ends one of two ways.   A quick rush to kill the boss, or an ever lasting turtle.
---
Not to say others don‚Äôt truly love classic, but you can tell he just loves the game and isn‚Äôt doing it for the money.
---
Hey screw you man. I'll be 28 by the time classic releases again and will also be taking a college course because I want to sterr my career the fuck away from application development lol
---
I'm totally going to min/max my fun.
---
You can do both at the same time.  Sort of like watching a tv show or movie while you farmed in vanilla WoW back in the day.
---
I really don't think this is that impactful under the condition that Blizzard genuinely completely turns it off after 1-2 weeks when players are more spread out, if they keep this too long it'll suck dick.
---
One of my favourite parts of classic was when I saw someone killing a quest mob and I had to spam "inv" to blind eyes, why would you do this blizzard.
---
&gt;  I don't see how it permanently fucks the server population
---
9k &gt; 3k. A permanent three times increase over vanilla in server pop is fucking stupid.
---
I never said sharding doesnt effect the game, I said it was a necessary and *temporary* fix.
---
At this point I'm pretty sure you're just trolling or can't read.
---
To come and say that
---
I mean, we all died early on vanilla. Not everyone has lived, breathed and studied it the last 8 months (or more for rhat matter)
---
I actually do have a friend who played Day 1 while he was in high school. He dropped out of college, then later joined the navy and is now back in school. 
---
And I have another Day 1 friend who was in college at the time. Now he teaches, so he is back in school as well.
---
50k+ people including myself watching 5 dudes run a 15 year old dungeon.
---
MadSeasonShow and Platinum WoW got the shaft too.  It's a shame.
---
yes? but they will have even less competition if they would have to fight for it on 1 server?
---
also the mafia is a thing.
---
Could you imagine if you applied this logic for everything Roflflflflflflflflflflflflflf
---
There‚Äôs a huge difference between someone who‚Äôs generally negative and someone with a predisposed bias. 
---
Your argument is basically, ‚Äúgive someone who‚Äôs worse at the job the job, because they‚Äôll find mistakes someone far more qualified MIGHT not find‚Äù.
---
Genius.
---
Bless, I don‚Äôt know what it is but not being able to organize my characters gets me irrationally annoyed.
---
You f**in hater
---
That will be in the game from the beginning.
---
Im from Bulgaria and if u dont work wow subs seems too pricey for ordinary teens tbh. I appreciate what u do !
---
Exactly, which is why I want them to keep it as vanilla was.
---
We had to do this a ton in my major (electronic systems engineering). We got the phrase WHAT DOES THE CONVERSATION LOOK LIKE drilled into our brains, I'll probably never forget it.
---
Right, because no one who plays BFA has played vanilla. 
---
why would they send out invites to people who's not having a subscription, risking sending out betas to people who's not even active?
---
Bfa raid? lol what a looser.
---
You know when summer ends?
---
Or when the player dropoff is much more severe than anticipated, for example because literally half the server population was made up of the viewer base of a large variety streamer who moved on to the next big thing two weeks in.
---
Funny thing is, both scenarios will be happening at the same time, and occasionally we might even hit the recommended realm population too. You just have to pick the correct one.
---
thanks. So t0 is the goal now.
---
Why would anyone want to watch someone else stare silently? Honestly someone tell me, i dont get it
---
Is that Uhdx gladiator druid from feenix?
---
I'm 22 and I'm in a similar situation with WoW.
---
I remember not having my own Warcraft account, but when I was over at my friend's house we would level this Night Elf on her dad's PC. I thought the /dance was the most amazing thing lol. So entertaining!
---
I remember always wanting to play the game but my parents always said no to the evil subscription. Probably for the best since I didn't know English anyways.
---
Played a lot of Pservers in later years and I'm so in love with this game! I can't wait to actually play it without worrying about server-owner drama! Though not a Nelf this time around. (Sorry child me, Horde is life)
---
That had a lot of implications as far as resources and the economy are concerned. Prices for rare good such as devilsaur leather and black lotus will be much, much higher than it was in vanilla.
---
Whoever is posting these things... thank you. So so much. Every little bit of info, good or bad, is quenching my thirst
---
I think it‚Äôs the general demographic of the players for Classic. Many of us are pushing 30 or already 30+ and didn‚Äôt grow up on streamers. We don‚Äôt watch streamers, nor understand why they really exist.....
---
hes still in leveling greens, there arent shoulders at that level.
---
Analogy still doesn't work when one's significantly better than the other. It's more like Blizzard saying "here's a way sturdier, bigger boat which is far less likely to make you sick".
---
If my options are a handful of layers with thousands of people on each and which gets better and better within weeks vs. people in every zone popping in and out constantly who may not even be from my server for the entire game duration? I know what I'm picking.
---
For anyone who did receive an invite did the invite come via Mail?
---
So what is it then? Is advertising not a service anymore?
---
I don‚Äôt even needed to explain to my boss why im taking last August week off.
---
But to my wife... just told her im taking a week of to myself. She is going to kill me, send help.
---
This exact logic is what brought you LFR, group finder, and the entire reason the current game is so damn bad that they‚Äôre rereleasing the 15 year old original game.
---
I can‚Äôt fully remember, but I think those were available from launch? And since the phase list mentions only t0.5 (even though that‚Äôs a more colloquial term), then imo it‚Äôs safe to assume t0 (or D1) gear will be available from the start.
---
I think they probably would have done something different than talent trees if they could go back. You either end up with useless class options, or if you make every class have 3 useful talent builds you make it so instead of 9 classes you have 27 which is a much bigger work load.
---
I understand why they decided to balance out the specialization options in BC.
---
Did someone say...
---
A logical response on this sub.  I tip my hat to you, good sir.
---
100% agreed there, I'm just dirty Alliance scum. Only class I would play on Horde is Shammy too, so no Undead Female casting animations for me :(
---
I absolutely NEED to have both sulfuras and thunderfury so when I swap to sword and board in pvp people can see how big my epeen is. Oh and also scarab lord mount.
---
Hey at least you got it, I thought my joke would be lost forever \^\^
---
Windfury could still proc windfury in 1.12 there were some other bugs that were fixed with it in 1.4 though.
---
Streaming isn‚Äôt about being the best it‚Äôs about being likable enough. 
---
Alright if players who are very good just aren‚Äôt entertaining because of the autism

REEEEEEEE^EEE^EEE^EEE

And then we wonder why everyone else thinks the classic community is toxic.
---
Started college at 24. Life happens.
---
Did you get an email notifying you got in, or did you just happen to check the launcher? If there wasn't an email, I'd guess some people just haven't realized yet. That, or people are at work.
---
 The concept is clear, but it still is bad for the servers eco-system, how is having multiple sources of goods in 1 server is reasonable? Multiple tidal charms per reset, multiple black lotuses per spawn point, multiple rare recipe farm locations that can be abused by a single player. There are more delicate ways about this, but this is best decision for Blizzard for cost saving and people gobble this shit pie with their happy faces on.
---
Yep. Thats gonna happen and there will be servers where it doesnt happen. Ill take my shot without sharding as a half population server with an actual community is worth way more then a full pop server with no community.
---
my brother in law just graduated with a bachelor's, he was in community college when i met my husband 10 years ago. he has 2 associates in addition to the bachelors.

Me saying that the two games have a different alroach to difficulty and I prefer the classic one is biased, yes. It's called having an opinion. I never claimed that my taste is universal.
---
how do you not understand what a laptop is
---
I just want to maximize my limited time. A little planning should help.
---
Simply having a additional layer implies less players on that layer than the first or the first and second to the third. Not only that it also grants you more chance of finding one simply by having more opportunities.
---
This thread is literally made for pointing out inconsistencies like this so that Blizz can make a decision on what to do about it. whether or not it "ruins the game" is irrelevant.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work and isn‚Äôt supposed to work. NEXT
---
It was.
---
Just to add https://youtu.be/NrSdjsrhX0s?t=474 example from Joana's leveling video. Natural lower level regen was just higher than people remember and what private servers set it at.
---
You'll have to upgrade. Classic and modern WoW client shares a lot of things, graphics rendering included. If modern doesn't run, Classic won't either.
---
Does this for sure work in the beta? I just remember this at all from back in vanilla.
---
Read the comment again and tell me whether I mentioned a laptop as an option, then answer your own comment
---
is this what it feels like to no longer be the target demographic
---
Which is why it is so great - we won't have to play with them because when they are in school we can level past them.
---
The name of zone in center of screen when it's changed is displayed the same way as on the live servers, it's annoying, why they didn't fix it, it was still in the Blizzcon demo .
---
A week off work. Possibly a small LAN party if my cousin is willing to make the trip to my place for release.
---
Other than that, no lifing the crap out of launch week.
---
#NoChanges is not subjective
---
Remember when people said it was pay to win and thought sub time meant "longer you've stayed subbed in total" and not when you first subbed? I agree that having to resub isn't completely pure, but I feel like this proves that people should chill before they freak out about vague wording...
---
You could bribe him a raid spot or some black lotus for a promotion
---
Meh, gf wanna farm her void elf anyway so I might just as well join her to finish it before classic is released anyway. And I'm addicted and a beta invite, even if it's a stress test, is my heroine!
---
It can't cause It would have more viewers than the shit that they call current wow
---
Seems like it just popped up in the launcher (over the play button, where you can choose which account to play on)
---
Well, I mean it was s gnome, isnt that their entire point? So checks out lol.
---
Just ask in the general chat if there's an orc rogue on the boat at Menethil.
---
If yes, come back later :D

Take time off of work only to sit on the log in screen receiving an error when I try to log in and wait for blizzard to announce what the issue is.... ya know, typical launch day BS
---
A friend of mine was born in 05 but his mom was pregnant with him in 04 and she played while he was inside her and he is now in going into 5th grade because he had to take some time off for soul searching and trying to figure out his twitch streaming alter ego so lay off him man. 
---
I don‚Äôt care people.
---
How big is the client?
---
I guess the streamers provide the platform for a bigger audience to spot bugs / suggest what to test, without the need to give everyone the key to get in.
---
If I can't commit to a class/race/faction you think I'm gonna commit to a degree and actually finish it?
---
Hope those people are playing on 800x600 monitors and living with their parents for the real experience 15 years ago. Otherwise why bother?
---
As if the majority of people that are excited for Classic are in school, oh wait they aren‚Äôt.
---
https://youtu.be/NrSdjsrhX0s?t=474
---
Here's proof of level 15 high regen from Joana himself. Going by 'it just feels off' is horrible feedback.
---
Yeah normalization may balance it out. That affected rogues the most, they won't be able to hit so hard with just a barman shanker
---
And they also said each layer would have a full server worth of people on it. Idk how much more clear they need to make this for you people to stop crying about something that's most likely won't be a problem.
---
How are you so triggered over a youtuber? Like I actually don't understand, and I made a thread with hundreds of  replies asking people why they're so triggered
---
Meh, at the very least since M+ there is no argument that there is no difficulty in current wow. It's okay not to like the direction it takes but if you seek a challenge yoi can get it in any content now. So yea, I get that this is tiring.
---
I'm a nerd. I use it as a phrase of affection actually.
---
I was a huge video game nerd. I still am. I played video games for 8+ hours a day in HS almost failing out. It was kinda too serious.
---
But, 15 or so years later I am now spending 10+ hours a day on my computer. This time, its WFH as a software engineer.
---
When I get bored, I walk up my houses stairs, that I own, and get into my BMW that I own, and go for a ride. When I get home, I have sex with my wife.
---
All of this more or less made possible by being a *nerd*.
---
Nerds run the world. People dont like that. People who arent nerds, want to run the world themselves. Unfortunately, they just are not smart enough.

---
and why don't you even consider the vanilla option, normal servers?
---
Can you test to see if any of the graphic modes (like the Classic button) change the FOV?
---
Does it matter if I‚Äôm not filling out a bug report? Blizzard is off chasing a bug that doesn‚Äôt exist because the streamer never played in Classic and is used to BFA crap.
---
Rubbish. Your American system doesn't represent the rest of the world. Degrees in Europe are 3-4 years.
---
Too much sense of pride an accomplishment
---
They aren't stress testing it for sure. Its like 30 people online on each faction right now, but we'll see if more invites roll out. During stress testing everyone with a sub can play for the day.
---
 No, the server has multiple sources of goods in it, there will still be someone that takes control over things one way or another and will abuse the shit out of this system.
---
Its only a fallacy if its unsubstantiated. Slippery slope arguments can have merit but have a bad reputation because of how popular it is with religious fundamentalists and homophobes.

THUNDERFURY BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER DID YOU ASK ABOUT THUNDERFURRY BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER

but then how would he let people know he's outraged and against it.
---
Dude, now the server is lagging, stop spamming :p
---
Why do you need to be in your bed lol
---
Just like they can all get max lvl in 2 days and all played in a top raiding guild and all their dads work at nintendo.
---
No idea if anyone has any plans to test this but would be interested myself.
---
I really don't know why, cause it's nothing special, but "mentally fucking challenged or not" made me laugh more than it should've

sorry but you don't talk about games with non-gamers, even if they're close friends. gaming is still one of the least socially accepted hobbies, and it's just not a good topic for small talk.
---
yeah i have wireless gear.
---
From a blizz standpoint, tgeyd ratger you yake a year per level at full sub
---
It's a minimal difference. The most jarring difference I've seen between max Vanilla (1.12 client) and Classic is the pumped up ground clutter/frill density. (You can also set high frill density in Vanilla, it's just that it needs editing the config file and the view distance is fixed leading to a weird look so I don't too many people bothered.)
---
Personally I'll reduce the frill density to original Vanilla while keeping the larger view distance. I'll also set the water back to original. That way it'll look almost like Vanilla just slightly better to my eyes.
---
Vurtne had the best PvP videos from Vanilla/leveling during TBC launch. Absolutely insanity what he could do on his Mage against 2-3 enemies trying to kill him at once.
---
Who cares about them? If they make fun of you for what you like, chances are they have as much personality as a paper towel. They'll make fun of you for WoW but at the same time watch Keeping up with the Kardashians unironically. 
---
Real people will be happy for you regardless of if they know what you're talking about or not. They'll see by your excitement that it's important to you and encourage you.
---
Hope to see you in Classic! :D
---
Also, that is demo??? In the demo it was sharding.. they changed that now..
---
Well started wow in 2005 and now with 28 years I'm writing on my master thesis which I plan/hope to finish on 26.08.2019 :)
---
I guess if we are counting what people did at 9 years old.  I had a Nintendo at 9, that is too young to remember anything more than a blur and occasionally wanting to break the controller in half.
---
I've been watching staysafe, he's been speed lvling on private servers for a long time, and on classic beta his lvling time is more than 30% slower. He is having a tougher time vs mobs, they are resisting more spells, using more abilities and doing more dmg and have generally better AI. Mana regen is also ~50% slower on classic beta than on private servers after he checked. So unlike seemingly half the people in this thread, it seems to me that classic beta is not undertuned at all, it looks to be pretty hardcore compared to what we've been used to on private servers at least.
---
Yes, I remember all that. Problem is this time it's not so clear-cut, hence why this sub's arguing about it so much. I think layering is the best solution to the problem, you don't. I do not believe it'll "fuck the game up like retail". It's not like the content release schedule where the majority of people were identifying the same objective faults and got Blizzard to rework it, and so many people on this sub still don't even *understand* what layering is, I've seen misinformed posts constantly since the release info went up.
---
It's extremely rare in software for a developer to develop a new solution to an existing problem and then say, "but if you didn't mind the old broken way of doing things here go nuts". It's a bad look for your company, it shows you don't have complete faith in your new tech. As a software dev myself I absolutely would not support old methods of doing things that have been proven to ultimately not work as intended, just to satisfy people who haven't even tried the new solution yet.
---
Thats the main problem. If each layer has a full server pop then what happens when ppl dont quit? At this point why not avoid the bad press with just having more servers and no sharding? Buffer it with "well if 2 servers fall under half pop then we will be looking into merging them" thats still a hell of a lot better then sharding.
---
The answer is they dont want to open more then x servers because sharding costs less then more servers. So if the population doesnt drop then they arent gonna force transfer the excess pop, they are going to continue sharding.
---
This is an extreme problem and this is when people need to talk up about it. Im fine with sharding if blizz and ppl like you think its tha answer but at least give everyone else the option to play without sharding. If blizz and you are right then our servers will be dead by phase 2 and we will have to reroll though i doubt that would be the case.
---
Hello I am Auroc.  I created my guild name, character race, class, and name, almost a year before the vanilla version World of Warcraft was released.  Like many of you are now doing for the first time in anticipation of the release of Classic World of Warcraft.  
---
I am sharing a screen shot that was before honor or battlegrounds of any kind.  This was before you were rewarded for player vs player combat, but Pvp had the had the most value in my opinion.  The rivalries you created, the players that earned your respect, your team on the battlefield, helped connect everyone involved to the world you were in.  The World of Warcraft.  If you did not Pvp around this time, you may find it difficult to understand why I I would long for the time where we did not have battlegrounds of any kind.
---
A lot of people will likely not even Pvp until there is a reward to do so.  In my ideal world, Crossrealm battlegrounds would not exist.  I understand the queue times, server unbalance issues, win trade abuse, and how Crossrealms can help alleviate those things.  I want my old Warcraft days back!  But, they are gone.
---
See you all in Classic World of Warcraft : )
---
1. You go into Retribution until you can respec to AOE grinding. That being said, without spelldmg on your gear, that build is pretty useless imo. So you have to roll and farm on mail &amp; plate with int and spelldmg to be ready to switch specs
---
2. If the group is dumb and won't let the tank do his job, it can be nightmare because you have no AOE heals, no instant HoT and also will not yet have most of your cooldowns. If you have a good tank and group you have the the most efficient single target heal in the game and you're good to go
---
3. There's a lot of guides on that topic and I think we can't say if the old addons will work at this point. Currently they include the updated raid frames in the game, maybe addons need to be fixed etc. PallyPower is a must, though!
---
4. I don't understand where this question is coming from. You mean how to be able to maintain overview in a choatic fight?
---
5. Definitly. It's practice and also efficient, as it's always good to keep the tank capped but not overhealing. And you don't need to waste much mana to heal your DPS classes, just use a small rank so they won't die
---
6. Yes, it is expected. As a holy paladin you will be in meele and auto attack enemies, judge seal of light or wisdom for heal/mana. In dungeons it adds fun to the otherwise boring aspect of healing. Only do this once you are comoftable with healing though, as this is your main job  
---
Just based on my experience &amp; my opinion :D
---
I don't know where you read that I want vertical progression, I never said that. I am just looking ahead and think that new content to progress through would be a good idea at some point. I've said that whether or not the new gear should be better than t3 is up for discussion, but that people would need an incentive to keep farming new raid content.
---
See kids? This is why there should never be Classic+. 100 threads for changes per day, and not a single one where atleast 3 people agree.
---
Wishful thinking.
---
Oh and BTW. This is a bait.
---
This is the 1.4 fix from the notes:
---
Shaman
---
\[Windfury\] - Fixed a bug that caused an additional attack beyond what was intended. In addition, fixed a bug that caused the next normal melee attack to happen sooner than intended.
---
Not sure what it means as I didn't play Shaman.
---
Nice of you to assume how and where I've spent my time since 2004.
---
Not specifically 1 item, but I really want to farm up T2.5 for my enhancement shaman. Sulfuras would be nice also, but I'm not delusional here.
---
Ah now I finally get it. It‚Äôs two servers right?
---
Tips ooooooout!
---
Don't see anyone triggered. Just opinions with lots of upvotes.
---
I can see boosting groups being a thing. Athene would do it to get World first 60/70/80. If people cared that much about Devilsaur farming, they could get together and power level a chosen person to 60 and have them farm devilsaurs.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEEE
---
Because the dude said he could play from his bed, I gave 3 possibilities, I am not sure what your problem is really. 
---
Either laptop, wireless peripherals or an interesting room arrangement. I was curious which it was. 
---
What your problem regarding that, I will never know
---
does this count as a shit post?
---
good luck with that one. if you will ever find it out of Runescape
---
True, the guy is a massive hypocrite.
---
I could sing it for you if you‚Äôd like
---
but there are not beta keys. it will be automatically activated on your account.
---
You can play with old graphics or more modern. Theres a slider.

Classic uses the modern engine and there are a few "free" (but optional) updates, the most notable ones being the modern shadows, water and increased ground clutter distance.
---
All models, textures, animations, effects, etc. are original Vanilla.
---
Short answer is no. 
---
The same questions were asked of the developers at a recent event. 
---
They‚Äôre still working things out in relation to amount of servers and server player caps, but did say that they can spin up more realms if there is higher demand than they predicted for launch.
---
I was actually thinking about taking the first few days of that week off but i didn‚Äôt think about this.. good call

I've already told my family I won't exist from August 26th - Middle of September.
---
I'm gonna have lots of tea for the beginnings and middles, water and diet kool-aid for the rest. I have an instant pot for big batches of rice, potatoes, and I'm even going to have a big stew going at one point, then a gumbo.
---
I have a playlist in the works that is *mostly* era appropriate, and when I get sick of it, I have The Office and Futurama on standby. 
---
And finally, my toilet is close enough that I'll be giving my poopsock a much needed rest this time around.
---
30 days plus bank holidays *muahahaha*
---
I mean I definitely care about having the gold for riding at 40 but I don't care about BiS, min maxing, or even running the cookie cutter spec while leveling.
---
It's very easy to be against something when you don't even attempt to think of alternative solutions. Just telling everyone that you're 'against sharding no matter what' isn't contributing to finding a solution to the problem, it will still exist when the game launches. That's what you want, right? Classic to meet your standards? So stop whining and contribute. How could they do this better, what is your solution.
---
Yesterday the general feeling was everyone in this beta was also in the original beta. Not a known, just discussed in general chat
---
I started in 04 while I was at school now have wife 3 kids and a full time job .... doesn't mean I didn't take a week off for classic heh.

Good luck with your rearming üí™

That's not true at all haha

Option 1: Laptop. Lying down on your stomach with a pillow under your chin/chest for support while you play. 
---
Option 2: sitting in bed against the frame, or a wall with a blanket and a laptop on your lap.
---
Option 3: same as option 2 but with a keyboard and mouse and WoW being projected to a TV near your bed
---
no need to resubbed to check characters anymore
---
you can log in even if your account is inactive.
---
Characters under level 20 would be playable
---
No point in downranking healing spells when you don't have +healing gear. I'd get all the talents you want in ret before going into holy.
---
Its pretty clear the reason why they are STILL in school is they played back in 04.

they won't be lolling when a caster takes a sword or dagger for the stam upg

*^(SPEAKS IN BABY 'NO CHANGES' RAGE)*
---
Who?
---
You‚Äôre the best! That‚Äôs absolutely it, thanks a ton
---
I‚Äôd be interested to hear why you think that. Lots of people no-life video games. Few dominate a server so effectively, let alone a megaserver with a bunch of hardcore vanilla players. I‚Äôm not in Apes, but this is a damn ignorant comment, unless there‚Äôs something of substance behind it?
---
No! Definitely a hunter!
---
Just put Ungoro in 1 layer.
---
Safe bet is to wait till Wednesday or Thursday after they fix whatever issue there will be, otherwise there‚Äôs a 99% chance you‚Äôll waste a vacation day
---
But in this case its gonna be to late if we try it first and theres the problem. If it does fk up classic like sharding fked up retail then were fked already. Sure in the perfect world i get what your saying but you cant change the name of something that fked up your current game and then claim its something completely new. Especially when it doesnt answer the biggest concern of what the problem was in the first place, namely what happens of people dont quit? At that point the only answer is to continue sharding forever or go into que times which makes this whole thing moot since its doing what they are claiming they want to avoid.
---
Haha how good it is? I mean. I too remember the exact agri range and regen rate as it was 14 years ago.
---
It's reason
---
I was going to reply to someone else but figured it matched pretty close with what you were saying so ill put it here.
---
\--------------------------------
---
They are looking into putting guilds on the same layer.
---
You have 2 layers per server.  You also have 2 other friends.
---
1. You're in the same guild, ah well then, no layer hopping
---
2. You all get popped into one layer, ah well then, no layer hopping.
---
3. Both friends get on the other layer, join their layer.  Guess what, you're all on the same layer now.  No more layer hopping.
---
4. You're all on the same layer.  "Oh, lets just relog!"  Thats right, I'm stickied to my layer and keep coming back to the same layer.
---
5. None of you are in the same guild.  You have 1 friend on the layer with you and another friend on the layer with them. Both friends have to remain on their distinct layers.  You can then be invited back and forth between layers.
---
Lets assume blizz does three things. First, Each layer has its own chat.  Second, Each layer has its own /who.  These would ensure that you have to have someone on your friends list to hop between layers as you cant just whisper randoms or world chat to find people in other layers.  Otherwise 1-4 wouldn't hold.
---
Finally A) Add a cd to switching between layers.  B) Keep track of players who keep moving between layers, and who's group they are joining to do this.  In the example above, after x number of hops, pull all three players to the same layer. This could be automated or verified by a person.
---
I'm not saying this will be done or that they will do anything to prevent hopping abuse, but pointing out that there can be methods to prevent it.  I came up with this in 5 minutes.  Blizzard has had much longer to work on this and still has months.
---
I understand being weary of abuse and pointing out the potential. After all, doing so may well put blizz on the track to fixing things they may have overlooked.  However, assuming that there will be easy methods of abuse for this system and prematurely calling out the apocalypse and pulling the pitchforks is just fear mongering and doesn't serve any purpose.
---
YOOOOOO
---
Kinda sad we dont have race specific weapons like totems or dwarfen axes.
---
Say there‚Äôs a raid I don‚Äôt have time to farm the pummeler beforehand. Are there other weapons that feral can use that provide decent DPS?
---
Hope to see this soon
---
You got it!
---
It's still after you've already gone through leveling 1-40, ofc the second time is more boring.
---
No.   Because there was no linking in chat
---
You can, but when I play games I focus on doing just that even when grinding. I‚Äôll maybe go as far as having some of my own music on but otherwise I don‚Äôt watch films or anything during game time since it breaks the immersion.
---
T
---
I dont think you can use the new models, they use a toally different rigging. They wouldnt work on said vanilla ones.
---
It's not dumbed down legion. I assume you said this because the demo was based on 7.3.5 but the beta is a bfa foundation. At least know what you are talking about when you correct people...
---
Paladins free heal when crit would suit you well
---
Do you even know how to read? Where did I ever allude to that?
---
I said the fundamentals of bosses now are the same as then, and many bosses are only slightly more complex at a normal and heroic level than a Vanilla boss. Mythic isn‚Äôt comparable to anything in Vanilla, it‚Äôs a different beast. Vanilla is (in all honesty) between LFR and normal for most bosses, with a few hitting between normal and heroic. Jumping immediately to mythic as your baseline for retail is also silly and honestly disingenuous when trying to compare difficulty. It‚Äôs like using naxx40 as your baseline for ALL of Vanilla raiding.
---
Dumbest meme I've seen so far. Imagine being say, 14 in 2004. That would make you 29 now. Even if you didnt take a leap year you could still be studying. Even more likely if you took a leap year or two, changed program(which is common in EU anyway) etc.
---
Holy shit, I just got my invite to Beta!
---
I renewed my account a few weeks ago in hope to get into the beta. Before that I had been unsubscribed for years. I started my account on Nov 23, 2004. 
---
I am at work right now, but will jump on to Beta as soon as I get home.
---
League is still the biggest game in the world.

---
As is typical, your CPU is too powerful for your GPU. The website recommends a GTX 960.
---
Literally spelled out in the announcement though...
---
Because "normal" servers haven't worked properly in the past. That's literally the reason they're coming up with this new tech. They don't want people to have to queue for 2 hours to play their game. They don't want 2000 people in Northshire on launch nor do they want low-pop launch servers that die after 6 months, then you have to resort to the old ways out, merges and transfers. They're trying to come up with a solution and a vocal group of people are just saying "no this will break the game even though we haven't seen it in action, give us the old way which already broke the game in a different way". 
---
Also this that I just posted elsewhere:
---
 It's rare in software for a developer to develop a new solution to an existing problem and then say, "but if you didn't mind the old broken way of doing things here go nuts". It's a bad look for your company, team and product, it shows you don't have complete faith in your new tech. As a software dev myself I absolutely would not support old methods of doing things that have been proven to ultimately not work as intended, just to satisfy people who haven't even tried the new solution yet.

Ironic as you probably were struggling to write that comment with toweliees cock in your mouth

Thanks for the gold kind stranger!

if I were you I'd just take it on August 30th instead. You never know if launch day will be a shit show and at least this way you're almost guaranteed you can enjoy your full day playing and a long weekend at the same time.

That really makes all the difference in the point I‚Äôm making doesn‚Äôt it...

Thanks a lot! Very helpfull.

I got an invite and actually did get an email, like 5 hours after getting in.

Awesome, thanks.  When I built this my gpu was pretty much top end.  Been years and years and years ago haha.

That's me. I'm just the teacher now.

so you play alliance?
---
I better not see a "wHaT dO wE dO aFtEr nAxX gUyS" ever again now that there's an entire sub dedicated to that question.
---
Oof I am a BC player
---
&gt;but for most of us it's September/October/November = Fall.
---
To be fair, in gaming it is common to use quarters and Q3 is often seen as the quarter for summer releases (which includes september). And in general mid-summer is seen as a really poor time to release a game, fall / winter is generally much preferable for companies. It clashes with the movie industry, outdoor activities, vacation etc.
---
Coupled with the fact that, as you say, the actual time for summer is well into september, I see no reason why we should not consider september part of the summer in this case.
---
Still, I agree that in everyday talk most would consider the season a bit different, but for that I think it is a bit vague. Sure most consider december 20th winter, despite it technically is fall - but then we get into where people personally put the line.
---
Layering will only exist for a few weeks bruv. I doubt all those people will hit 60 in sub 3 1/2 weeks then dissapear forever. When layering drops it's just one big server
---
I fucking hate this god damn song!!!!
---
this is amazing
---
Find some spec that works for both, and maintain another gear set.
---
That's the point, yes. I've seen lots of people claiming that a beta is not necessary because "it's vanilla, everything is already tested".
---
What a small little bubble you live in.
---
Ha! Alliance. Gross.
---
Really I am just 1) not smart enough to min/max, and 2) way, way, way too influenced by flavor to be a good min/max (or an adult) ... I will take something that looks awesome, even if it gimps.

I am here to chew bubble gum and look awesome... and I'm all out of bubble gum.

I'll be ordering an entire pallet of BAWLS energy drink. The best gamer drink ever made.

The most WoW ive played in my entire life has been in the last few weeks in anticipation for Classic. IM READY TO ROCK BOYS
---
I'm gonna try and lose some weight beforehand. Since I'll gain weight for sure when it launches. 
---
Gonna stock up on sugar free energy drinks and soda. Maybe meal prep a little, since im going to a friend's house for a week long LAN party and cooking there might be a bit difficult. By meal prep I mean getting crisp bread and toppings for that. Maybe some grilled chicken and rice.
---
Now I really want one of those guides! Just for the fun and nostalgia.
---
I can screen shot when I get home. At work atm... looking forward to my vacation in August. Made it to level 9. Had to adult and go to bed... Looking forward to long nights and junk food. Heh.
---
But you're supposed to roll need on BoEs for gold.
---
Just because someone had an account 15 years ago, it doesn't mean they would be good beta testers or know anything about the game. That is a total asinine reason for a beta invite.

I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes up about a beta key TBH.

At first I didn't get it, but the dogs made it very understandable. Thanks

If you were 5-6 in 04 you would be 20-21 which is still college age. Also some people skip one year of college to just relax. And some go work a bit so they have some college money. And some do part time college while doing part time work or full time work. 
---
Also people over 22 can go to college.
---
I don‚Äôt know what this even means...
---
yeah there's a bit of a gradiant of lightening and darkening to represent dawn and dusk. it doesn't just flip from dark to light.
---
Still need to keep an eye out on the weather stuff. Also did they make sure to crack their weather effects up to maximum in options??? It might be low by default.
---
It‚Äôs right over your launch button. You might have to restart your launcher.
---
The only answers to your questions are: server types. PvP, PvE, RP. They actually confirmed no RP-PvP at launch but maybe later. No news on server names, how many, and pop. Caps etc

I think these guys have been up all night and are just tired.

I‚Äôll give a little context since I just finished my first year at my uni. I‚Äôm 19 and have never played classic WoW , however I remember as a little kid my first class was a warrior during Wotlk. However it wasn‚Äôt till MoP when I wasn‚Äôt a casual and took the game serious. I remember paying some dudes to run me through those challenge mode dungeons haha
---
Cloth shoulders
---
Interesting. Shadow and lightening is a big point for me, so it's good to see videos like this. Wish I got in so i could've compared myself.
---
What I'm really interested in is nighttime effects and dynamic shadows. For example the nighttime classic Darkshore has a very peculiar light to it that's very immersive,  with strong bold shadows, and if you're on the beach the sand glimmer beautifully. I wonder if that's still there or not, because one of the things I dislike with retail si how they removed those bold shadows. 
---
Thank you for the video!
---
Ok, let's pretend I'm incorrect. Can you answer my first two questions at least? I'm really curious as to why you would purposefully put yourself in an uncomfortable position.
---
You‚Äôre delusional if you think they purposely implemented being able to cast a frostbolt/ backstab while facing away from the person because they were being extremely detail oriented in creating a real classic server lmao
---
Same, but replace TBC with WotLK.
---
Maybe you are being down voted because the image says nothing about retail WoW, and instead calls Blizzard as a corporation a failure. Which from many angles you can see why that would be the case.
---

OPEN THE GATE A LITTLE

Not every wow fan is a grown ass man in case you haven‚Äôt noticed. If they were smart they would have obviously taken advantage of a time when a large part of their younger player base has basically unlimited free time.
---
I clearly stated that it was research.
---
The difference is he‚Äôs collecting other people‚Äôs findings and reporting on it and not actually contributing anything new.
---
I get that, I guess what I mean is that it's hard to watch mediocre players act as though their viewership indicates they are good at the game or are a classic expert when they literally pronounce immolate as 'immoltate'.
---
You're still calling it the same thing when it isn't. Why are you clinging to the notion that it's identical while admitting at the same time that it might work? How can it possible be the same thing if it might have a different end result?
---
**IF** servers remain too highly populated, there's not only two solutions. Yes, keeping layering is one but then they squander good will with a lot of people and hurt the game, they're well aware of that. Same goes for queueing. Blizzard have the resources to increase/decrease spawn rates based on not only population but also login time patterns, i.e. don't have a fixed increase rate, make it dynamic based on how many people log in on average at that time of day. That's just off the top of my head, I don't work for Blizzard though. I'm sure they're not just sat there saying "this better work because we have no backup plan".
---
Basically none of what you said made any sense, next.
---
tips fedora
---
there was 100%
---
I would assume they're weighing when you opened your account a lot. They probably want to get people who played a substantial amount of time in Vanilla to test things out.
---
There is always hope for the open beta stress test weekends though.
---
Well, being 4 when WoW came out and my parents playing it, I've been exposed to it my practically my whole life, I remember when I was a kid, very little like 5/6, running around elwynn forest as a human warrior just hitting boars. So I techinally "played" in vanilla but not really lol. I'm 19 now, graduating next week and been actively and actually playing since late Cata, since by then I was old enough to understand what I was doing. Can't wait for classic to finally expierence what my parents and everyone played back then!
---
Idk, 7 years average checks out at least here in Portugal as well.
---
Easy. Just do the same thing as a Dwarf would.
---
Nice paragraph, lol.
---
He died because soda didn‚Äôt heal him? Am confused/10 at your point
---
I worked part time in GAME when I was in Uni and in the second year we all "acquired" beta codes.
---
damn those were the days :)
---
So by your definition , you are literally the one triggered lol. That was easy, thanks for confirming for the rest of us. Enjoy the block kid.
---
If you are trying to compare it to classic back in the day then yes it looks different it‚Äôs the aspect ratio and resolution.
---
oh, okay
---
Dark Edge of Insanity. BIS PvP.
---
Cairn Bloodhoof has a totem that you get grand slammed by if you raid him. I remember going there in the early days and getting punted halfway across Mulgore - it was epic!  
---
But yes I think those would have been a unique thing to add. Who else could swing a tree !? No other race could wield one of those suckers.
---
&gt;  "higher resolution." 
---
lol.
---
That‚Äôs weird. I was playing WoW, MediEvil, Diablo, Pokemon, Spyro, Crash, and Dinocrisis at 6 and remember them all. And I know I never played Spyro enter the dragonfly after that. Because my Spyro disc went to where ever my orange metal tank ape Optimus prime from beast wars disappeared to.
---
This session is so sad. These guys cannot test anything  -.-
---
I think it might be the lighting and the fact grass moves out of the way. Other than parts of the ui of course
---
I THINK it has upgraded graphics? (It‚Äôs a toggle-able option)
---
I don't even know what to think really.
---
in wailing caverns?!!
---
based REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE posters all get my vote
---
Day 1 player checking in. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get in the beta.
---
It will remain like that.
---
I mean other than the obvious things like aspect ratio being much different then we all played on our crappy little square monitors, there are some graphics improvements like shadows, environmental clutter/detail, and water effect options. Or is it something else?
---
They Said it works differently? What more do you want ? If you dont trust what their developers say, I mean, nothing will change your mind
---
Had some valid points until you decided that him not playing vanilla was a reasonable reason for hate. Toxic elitism is the worst part about this community.
---
Even if the servers don‚Äôt work properly, I can lounge around and relax from work for a day. Not how I intended to use it, but still a very successful vacation imo.
---
"An adult"
---
"very small beta" running for 3 months?
---
I had made some kind of happy remark about the release date outloud when seeing it, which lead to me being asked why I had made said happy remark outloud, i explained it and they responded negatively. Its actually a really simple situation that triggered a thought process.
---
Putting guilds into the same layer won't do anything.
---
Literally just use discord for communications and stay guildless to keep jumping around.
---
Blizzard has made beta for hype purposes for a while now. I don't mind of 2 or 5 streamers just do some media thing, as long as the hundreds who are on the beta do test bugs.
---
I remember people getting upset that you could mail multiple items at the same time in the demo.
---
‚ÄúParticipants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. ‚Äú
---
This is what I read, seems clear to me. Are we not reading the same post?
---
74
---
No but I've been to a few huge festivals. I could barely move :D.
---
I mean, Blizzard is getting some negative publicity right now for NOT giving him beta access for the very reasons that OP stated.
---
The best way to enjoy a niche hobby is to also be self-aware of it. You're absolutely correct.
---
literally unplayable
---
Everything on the internet is serious business. Shame on you.
---
WoW Classic will do just fine without streamers baiting views for clicks and subs. It will also do just fine with the community hating on the streamers for it - I am positive the streamers know what they are doing so I can't really see them objecting to the fairly leveled criticism.
---
Don't worry. Classic will be around for a long ass time and a big chunk will level really slowly. You will have plenty of time to enjoy the game even if you can't play much at launch.
---
Serious question:
---
Whats the difference between a 6k pop 2 layered server with basically 200% of resources and two 3k pop classic server with 100% (the normal amount) of resources.
---
You have more resources, but you will also have more demand. Also since nobody will have gold in the beginning, economy is going to be fcked anyways? 
---
started playing in Cata
---
Then tried to say he played Vanilla
---
don't worry we are getting ur comment removed.
---
you seem to miss one important thing, those normal servers do work and are exactly why people want vanilla, private servers are proof. people hate the idea of sharding and what it has done to wow and the integrity of azeroth is a bigger deal than some queues in the first days until enough servers have established.
---
I disagree, it is tehnically a seperate game.
---
I would rather they invite players from previous betas that actually test and give feedback.
---
But it truely seems so random right now that neither are relevant.
---
Tiresome watching people complaining about everything all the fucking time even though MOST of the things complained about doesn't affect gameplay AT ALL. If it annoys you simply don't play the game, simple as that.
---
Found the necklord
---
Yah I don't see why they couldn't have been. I still think Human and Undead should have been able to be hunters also...  
---
That lurky guy is spooks  AF
---
I definitely do not miss lugging CRTs around lmao
---
How is it not the same thing? We went over this earlier. Sharding is cross realm instancing. If layering has layers that have the population of a server (realm) that you can phase in and out of then its sharding. Its the same exact thing.
---
Also, i never said it might work. I said it might make a server population what they think it should be after the people quit. Thats the only aspect it might work. Id still take a half pop server with a fully grown server community then a full pop server that has been patchworked together with sharding. The server population being full and a good, functioning server are 2 completely different things
---
My only plan is to play when I'm not at work. While I understand all of the people that are unhappy about a late August launch because of school starting back, having the launch date pushed back that far is actually perfect for me as my youngest starts school next year (2019-2020 school year) and I mostly work a 1 PM -9 PM shift at work, so that pretty much frees up my mornings to no-life Classic WoW most every day. And I'm going to enjoy the hell out of it. I'll be no-lifing it up, but in a very laid back easy. No rush to 60. Just sure back, enjoy the sights, explore the world that was and is again, get way too mad at "Your Fish Got Away" and failed herb/mining attempts, and just overall enjoy the hell out of the works I used to know and love!
---
And I'm going to do it all with no real planning involved beyond knowing that I WILL have an undead priest, and I WILL have an Orc (class undecided). I will use no add-ons except for POSSIBLY a bag add-on to help me organize my bags and bank, and MAYBE an AH addon because let's face it, even for casual use the AH UI sucks.
---
I plan to read the text for every single quest, no matter how clearly I remember what I'm supposed to do in each quest and just completely lose myself in the story and gameplay. That story is what first got me hooked on Warcraft, and how accessible the game was (compared to EverQuest which I was also playing at the time) is what got her to ultimately stick with WoW for the long term.
---
I know I can never fully recreate that first time/new to the gave experience I had almost 14 years ago when I first started playing this game, but I intend to create an experience that is as close to it as I can possibly get!
---
Yikes. The streamer hate army is waking up again.
---
the absolute state of someone who thinks having to invest some spare change into a bunch of alt-guild charters or spending a few tokens on another account is going to deter 24/7 discord mafia tryhards from having - get this - infinite gold to be set for lyfe and opportunity to corner markets for the duration of classic thx to said infinite gold
---
That's absolutely not too young to remember it. I remember a lot of bits and pieces from around that time playing my NES, SNES, PS1, Genesis, and GBC. Lots of memories of playing Digimon World, Monster Rancher, Monster Seed, 3Xtreme, Dave Mirra's BMX, Sonic 1-3, Super Mario All-Stars and World, Final Fantasy, Duck Hunt, Crash Team Racing, Tomba 2, Donkey Kong Country, Colony Wars, and so many more. I can't remember much else from that time but I absolutely remember the games I played around that age.
---
The graphics are automatically higher than vanilla, but there is a toggleable "Classic" option
---
Could it be the fact that you remember looking at vanilla through a crappy 4:3 CRT monitor?
---
I was in classic alpha and beta a day 1 collectors edition player and I am not in beta. I also have a friend I play WoW with who works for blizzard who has flagged my account as F&amp;F and have yet to get in yet. More people should be getting in later today.
---
Not necessarily - your party should agree on the rules before an instance begins. Many groups agreed to greed BoEs so that if a person needed they could need and get it. If you need on a BoE in a group setting with those rules you should then equip the item (or use the schematic/recipe/etc) to demonstrate that you aren't taking it for gold but because you actually need.

A/B/C would still provide means for preventing abuse whether having a discord mafia or not.
---
Just take Thursday / Friday off instead of the Tuesday of launch
---
 Dude, now the server is lagging, stop spamming :p
---
Spawn on all layers, despawn on other layers when engaged, simple.
---
Because in a few months when the surge of new players is gone this won't be required and will be turned off.
---
If they just launched loads of servers to compensate when the player count dropped you'd end up with empty servers and people would want to server change or be forced to re roll to the high populated servers, this negates that.
---
------&gt; MoM &lt;------
---
Perfect, let those people go on pserver then
---
I don't remember ever needing to actually use the option or what it was even really for, just that it was there and made the screen go weird for a second.

I mean I can permit you the taste of bawls if that's what you're craving
---
We‚Äôre getting everyone‚Äôs life stories like it‚Äôs a serious post. Also OP stated ‚Äúmost of /r/classicwow.‚Äù He‚Äôs probably referring more to the kids on here rather than the adults.
---
Wowhead has a [classic version of their site](https://classic.wowhead.com/).
---
Other than that there is also [ClassicDB](https://classicdb.ch/) which is what most folks from private servers have been using for a while now.
---
I didnt play in '04 but '05. I was 15-16 at the time and started working right after HS.
---
Started studying again, at college 2 years ago. So yeah, this applies to me.
---
&gt; Haha this is my case. I just worked for years after high school. Recently enrolled for fall 2019 at the local tech college for an associate's degree. Turning 29 next month
---
Exactly. I don't see what makes this so surprising to some.
---
People don't always start and finish school prior to age 23. Some people take more time (most actually) to decide what they want to do for the rest of their lives.
---
Seriously bro, I think this is more of a reading comprehension thing now. No offense.
---
It most certainly is hard and punishing. Once you learn it is not supremely "Difficult" but it certainly is challenging and takes time. If you take someone new to the game and put them on retail vs put them on vanilla.. im sure they would think vanilla is "hard"
---
Not really.
---
Thanks orange!
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs definitely rollout invites (10-20 each day) rather than 1k a month on a specific date.
---
Screen resolution, CRT monitors not being common anymore, HD video quality being commonplace, and network WAN speeds of 100Mbps+ to the home being fairly standard are some pretty big factors that might influence the differences that you're seeing. It's not 2005 anymore.
---
I played WoW at 5 because I got my dad to play (We both loved WC, Diablo and SC).
---
Funny enough even back then I was better than him at games. My altoholic syndrome was in full force back then so I‚Äôd level peps to like 20ish and try and do SFK before rerolling. Where as my dad would stick with his Troll hunter to 40 but had bad gear so I‚Äôd play on it and get it gear through dungeons. And it was night and day gear wise. Killing shit went from a pain to easy asf.
---
Also my dad couldn‚Äôt even make it past the museum in MediEvil 2. I beat the game though....
---
Also now I really miss Sir Daniel Fortisgue back from the dead once again...
---
Well the servers did lag out a few times early on so they're getting something out of it.
---
Nah, literally every single time i come to this subreddit people complain just to complain. I'm a pissed off 26 year old.
---
I spoke to a blizz rep yesterday. I got 4 accounts. oldest one was made in 2005. have one currently active with BFA. They told me it's completely random.
---
Not sure what your point is - I didn't say anyone disliked it. I simply praised how well Blizzard makes their cinematics. I know it is trendy to hate on retail at this sub, but not everything is implied "retail sucks".
---
I was more thinking about my private server experience
---
I absolutely see your concern. But layering is to survive, and enable 6-12k players playing on one realm at the same time. People are taking days off work/school to play the first few days. Lots of people are probably going to log in to just see what all this fuzz is about. There's a lot of extra load the first few weeks because of that. When that rush cools down, they merge the remaining 70% (or however many is left) and the population would probably be higher than what the server can "handle". But then normal routines are back. some want to play only evenings, some can only play mornings and some plays only in weekends etc. That will hopefully also ease the load a bit, and we'll only see queues during peaktimes. 
---
I would also say, personally, that i'd rather be on a single realm with layering and then merge with people i might have met before, than play on a server that dies after the first month and merge with a different server with people i haven't seen before at all. 
---
Also, my previous reply, although maybe a bit hostile, was just addressing the concern of people layerhopping to farm devilsaurs. I don't believe that will be a problem because there will be people farming on each layer.
---
Grade school.
---
Ah, was hoping for new models, textures, animations and effects as well. Guess that'll come some day though =)
---
Theres professional tetris players... We ok fam.
---
What? Layers are basically seperate servers that you can phase in and out of just like sharding. How are those retail servers communities working out?
---
You don't remember what you think you remember.  You were 9.
---
Not  different from any other desk job if not for you being your own boss and yourself decide when to clock in
---
And it then unclogs itself immediately in fear of inconveniencing Chuck Norris.
---
Yeah by stress tests I meant the days they‚Äôve already announced as stress tests
---
Try https://vanillafriends.com/. Also spread the word about it because I'm sure there are lots that don't know.
---
I‚Äôm just excited about having a population high enough to easily find groups. 
---
Being worried about ‚Äúgetting kicked easier‚Äù is straight scrub mentality, and that is not at all a good reason to want lower population servers.  
---
I was trying to help you out, you don‚Äôt have to be a scrub who is worried about being kicked, you can also form the groups yourself!
---
Hi, /u/Yelnik
---
‚ôø vanilla veteran coming through ‚ôø
---
You said this:
---
&gt; If it does fk up classic like sharding fked up retail then were fked already 
---
"if" layering fucks up Classic, meaning it might not fuck it up. Sharding fucked up classic already, objectively. They cannot be the same thing if one might lead to a different result. Unless you meant to say "when it fucks up classic", but you can't make that statement because you don't know what's going to happen - because *they're different*. Two things performing a similar action on massively different scale does not make them the same thing. It's like calling a castle and house the same thing because they're both buildings.
---
Anyway. We aren't going to come to an agreement here but thanks for the discussion.
---
/r Gatekeeping can take the summer off
---
Let me love you too
---
True. I‚Äôll stress test the mess out of Hogger

[Krol Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2244), not for stats but for nostalgic reasons.
---
Are you saying that you MUST have an active sub to receive a beta invite?
---
Is the question 'will Oceanic servers get the beta too?' ?
---
FWIW the Korean servers don't have a beta yet either. Source: me.
---
They can‚Äôt hear you over their rage.
---
Shills out in FULL FORCE. You're just so eager to gargle on blizzards dick.
---
WOAH NO, MY QUEST NPC IS DEAD, YO BRO, INV ME TO LAYER 2 :)))) Literally STV will be filled with people just ghosting in and out of layers as they join different groups for quests. It's going to be a hot joke.
---
thx dude I forgout about that :D dont think i\`ll get an invite but worth the shot :D
---
You say that but OP is everywhere in the thread being a dick to anyone who might actually be the people he is pretending don‚Äôt exist.
---
I think I‚Äôm gonna go for the next week. Friday is casual day so I don‚Äôt like taking Friday‚Äôs off.. I know lame excuse. But I‚Äôll give it to the next week anyways just to be sure it‚Äôs smoothed out, probably the next Monday and Tuesday
---
Thats why im asking for an option. Ppl like you are ok with layering and think its the right choice whereas ppl like me see it as sharding and dont wanna risk my server community being destroyed like in retail so just an option would be great.
---
I'm not in the beta, but I'm pretty sure pserver numbers are way off. Joana in his 2006 video gets Honored with Orgrimmar at level 21. He only skips RFC and a few quests in the barrens. On a pserver you get Honored before level 10.
---
I never once doubted that  this sub is full of doctoral candidates and graduates.
---
they could make some sort of server packages, like 3 4k servers that all share the same name database, but are unique servers in every other aspect. Then once the initial wave dies off those servers could easily be merged without people getting mad about namechanges. not really different to 1 server that is split in 4 3k layers that will sooner rather than later merge anyway.
---
Not bugged, at least is the same on private server.
---
Btw the heal on Guzu hits but he dies without getting the heal, is that normal? Or there is a problem with the implementation of spell batching?
---
me. i'm planning on taking my time to get through the game and will only look at that stuff til the very end when i absolutely need it.
---
Nice, sorry my comment came off like I was telling you how to live your life but yeah just avoid the first day or two and you won't waste your vacation time
---
I work for a school now D:
---
I agree with you, it makes sense for me. Thanks for your insights.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/](https://classicdb.ch/) is my go-to.
---
Absolute Units
---
Wow, Y'all are making me feel old. I played classic in '04 after moving over with my raid guild in Everquest. Had some amazing times but I shutter to think how much time I spent raiding. I'm a parent now with two kids and a busy job. I don't see myself having the time to play classic wow much. I might just leave the past in the past.
---
Find out what server he‚Äôs on and gank him. 
---
Kidding, he sounds awesome.
---
That job would be called "raid healing" as opposed to "tank healing." Off-healing is pretty much always off-specs throwing out heals in emergencies.
---
People think this ruins holy/reck and ret/reck builds, but honestly it does nearly nothing to the spec other than you cant just walk up to someone and delete them. The later this game goes on reckoning just gets stronger.
---
Completely different in my eyes because if the server pops dont bottom out then your an independent server with a healthy community instead of a patchwork one.
---
It's funny watching the retail players struggle with Classic.  They all think they can just rush in like retail.
---
except for the part about tips faking he played vanilla
---
what's the music playing in the background?\^\^ thx
---
Idk dude I watched streams for like 6+ hours yesterday and I literally didn't see a single streamer submit a big report.
---
What you do on/off stream is your own business but I'd like if they set a good example for other beta testers.
---
Lol. Alright, I'll believe it. Sounds like having more self-awareness would fix some of the problems in your life. Don't yelp out loud at work and don't talk about niche nerd shit that is not socially accepted outside of friend groups and places like here. It's perceived as cringeworthy by everyone but us, whether you like it or not. It's socially damaging, and some sense of self-empowerment is not worth committing social suicide over.

Honestly as long as I get the name I want I‚Äôll be happy. Most disappointing thing for me was when I created a character and thought of a good name, only for someone else to have thought of it first.

Ok? Im not talking about non-US people then what the fuck?

I feel like its an excuse to get people to buy subs for a chance. I feel like I'm about to gamble money here but I really would like to see how it runs on my bad laptop since I played private servers for years no worries.

Hi, /u/OBLIVIONpistol
---
Why is that Being a Scumbag ? If u can get someone else to pay for ur account and earn like 50 euro a month playing a month just to let someone log your account for 3 houRs or so a week when you‚Äôre sleeping I‚Äôd take that if I lived in a 3rd world country. Some people don‚Äôt even make 63 euro a month working their ass off..
---
My dad threw me in front of WoW when I was 5 years old. So I played in like 05/06? I graduate High School tomorrow.

Day 1 player, not subbed, not invited :P
---
Streamers saying they just "got lucky" with their invite OMEGALUL
---
Because chances on this sub are that he‚Äôs not trying to actually contribute to the conversation and is more likely posting to say ‚Äúhey look at me I‚Äôm special because I don‚Äôt watch twitch streams like you children ;)‚Äù.
---
That‚Äôs completely false and you know it.  These streamers have to stream consistently and market product when asked by publishers.  It‚Äôs not a dream job by any means.  And I can see how it would take a toll mentally on the streamer.
---
It‚Äôs toxic.
---
Two things. First, you literally said it wouldn't have been made/possible without streamers in your OP. Second, your triggered for some reason.
---
Perfect
---
Who are you to tell me what I do or don't remember? Long term memories start forming before then. That's not to say that you'll remember everything from that time but certain things do stay. I very clearly remember a particular Saturday at that age where I started a new game in Crash Team Racing and beat it by the afternoon because of how well I already knew the game. I also very clearly remember the morning of 9/11 which happened when I was 9 years old.
---
*Highly* unlikely. Classic is not a remaster. It's a recreation of Vanilla.
---
I'm not going to pretend it's a guarantee, and I also don't speak for Blizzard. It bothers me when people do that. That said, if there is a way to switch layers at will, whether it's by relogging, or creative grouping with other players, it absolutely will be used to farm multiples of the same mobs/nodes/chests, etc. Blizzard is going to have to address this.
---
Its Phase 1...
---
It's like fucking a hot step sister you know it's wrong but it feels so right
---
At first the day before he thought that the beta was going to have beta keys, as every other beta ever has had, however comes beta day blizzard released a blue post stating that the beta won't be with keys but they would choose people from their subscribers. He made a sarcastic joke on that day saying that he would giveaway beta keys because of what happened the day before holy shit...
---
9 isn't 4.
---
I watched him for the first time the other day when he interviewed the two devs. How long has he been calling himself "Tipsout"? He seems a little old for that at this point.
---
Then his catchphrase, "And as always, tips out baby." - really? That's what you're going with?
---
The game is slow compared to retail wow. You have to eat/drink, no mounts while leveling, can only pull 1-2 mobs at a time, and it takes players longer to
---
do 1-60 on classic then it does to level 1-120 on BFA. You may not think that classic wow is slow but it IS slow compared to retail and many other MMOs. The fact that it‚Äôs slow isn‚Äôt necessarily an insult or a bad thing, Blizzard put systems into the game to make it the way it is on purpose.
---
well but it has more impact. all those mafia tryhards will swim in 8k instead of 2k worth of devilsaur leather after a month.
---
He prob picked the name to get more buyers kek.
---
It's pretty amazing that there's a fully documented 1-60 of this game. It's pretty disappointing that after 3 years of development there's still this many issues.
---
I turn 30 3 days after classic launches, safe to say I get to ruin my life all over again! 
---
And I can‚Äôt wait üôÉ
---
It's continental sharding, everything else works the saem
---
They said RP-PvP servers might be in at launch. I think just one RP-PvP server for NA and one for EU.
---
Na, seems about right tbh.
---
if its to do with things looking darker thats because i think most of the streamers atm are using ultra shadows. If the shadows are on good or high things start to brighten up a bit even at night
---
Sadly, i don't think they'll make it an option. But i think you will have a very good time playing anyways. I hope that at least! =)
---
i'll take things that never happened for 500 alex
---
i just want a beta invite so i can just log in and stay in the forest killing boars T\_T
---
It's true. We all play Troll Warriors.
---
Need RP servers for Classic Australia.
---
The min/max crowd have their corner. Usually populated by NEETs, anal retentive types, and mild to moderate autistic people. As long as they stay in their corner and don't shout at others playing different ways ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø who cares.
---
My plan is to level slow but efficiently. Sounds like a contradiction but hear me out. I've played this game for hundreds and hundreds of hours. At this point, I know what spec is best for leveling, what gear to grab along the way, how to minimize downtime, all the dungeon fights, lots of quest locations, etc etc. When i'm questing i'll blow thru the quests and find myself with the option to move to another zone, grind a spot(I know the best spots), or do a dungeon. Most people in this situation say "questing is fastest". It sure is, but so what.
---
What im going to do involves maximizing my gear while I level and wrecking Alliance in world pvp. Using a pvp spec to level. The gnomes will fear getting trampled, and the elves will cower in stealth. By 60, the Alliance will know me by name.
---
I tried to make sure to stress that it is not objextively alow but certainly slower than live. Kinda sad that didn't come across
---
i think he did it just for the Lul's in the Chat ,they are also streaming almost 24 h
---
Tbf agility is really good for warriors, but idk about the deleting part.
---
The only players that would know most of the issues are private server players. I'm not saying all of them, most of them are more clueless than players who don't play or work on private servers but some private server players have spent years doing research and most of them have good recollection of vanilla/tbc/wrath and great knowledge. I know because I myself have been involved in a few successful private server projects and worked with a lot of these kind of people, who, to my genuine surprise, not only know a lot about the game but also have a deep love for these past expansions.  
---
It is easy to think that private servers are this lair of clueless people who pop custom servers for no other reason than to cash in(there are some of these for sure) if you are not active on them but you would be surprised at how much research goes into creating a blizzlike, long-term private server that actually cares about quality.
---
I'm definitely going to take my time and enjoy the journey. The last time I really enjoyed leveling was during TBC or maybe WotLK.
---
Was in college in 04, in college now. 
---
But I had 9 years of Air Force in between. 
---
People just make different life choices.
---
Ah i see you too spent an enormous amount of money on an IT/CS degree
---
Its normal read wowhead, hits like truck just bad pre heals and tips made bug report its hitting too hard :D
---
Thanks, man. I joined.
---
By what metric? Games like Crossfire, Dungeon Fighter Online make a ton of money and have a lot of daily players.
---
I noticed the field of view is different. If you compare side by side slides from BlizzCon and their reference client, you'll find that you can see more in the demo screenshot, which has the side effect of making objects in the world smaller on your screen.
---
Also, the fog effects are different, making Classic look "brighter". I assume because they can't replicate them on their current servers.
---
Mobs still slide backwards instead of turning around to reposition themselves when you get too close.
---
Ya i doubt it too since blizz hates admitting they are wrong xD.
---
I personally wont be playing classic if theres any form of sharding but i do hope you and the others get a game you will enjoy =]
---
Oh, well if that's the case then the reason there probably aren't many guides on it is because you can't really train someone to pull off clutch moves that happen organically as a result of dire situations.  If a raid is going well then the main/raid healers shouldn't be dying. I can see it being necessary in some fights though, like C'Thun when people get dragged into the stomach. 
---
In this case - have your heals on a side-bar or secondary toolbar and be ready to switch to them when your primary healers call the need for it. Communication is key in these scenarios.
---
I played since early tbc, and enjoyed it and wotlk. After that everything went to shit - and things were getting shitty during wotlk anyway. 
---
After that I don‚Äôt even know what order the panda dragon wars shit neither did I keep count of how many expansions there are. It was all just shit and boring. 
---
Now the problem is classic/tbc won‚Äôt work in today‚Äôs environment because everything has to be optimal nowadays. 
---
People won‚Äôt just play the game and explore, they‚Äôll complain about broken class mechanics and dead classes and easy rotations.
---
I‚Äôm not saying vanilla is bad it is an attractive idea.
---
But honestly I think it would be a better game if there was a new game that learnt from the old. Something very drastic, like a remake of vanilla.
---
Basically a level squish, a class rework, a de-class-homogeneralisation, removal of toxic conventiances also. 
---
Take naxramas in vanilla and wotlk as an example :
---
Looked great on paper but in vanilla is what hard because of gear and coordination.
---
In wotlk is was hella easy because coordination and people knowing how to play their class. 
---
What I‚Äôm getting at is that players, and their classes, are a lot of... powerful and knowledgeable now.
---
The problem wasn‚Äôt the environment / gaming lacking challenges but rather the classes being broken and the players lacking tools or knowledge to interact with the game efficiently.
---
Density, yes, but you couldn't have the "modern" hd look. It's still old models, which is fine.
---
Thanks! I joined.
---
sweet, thank you :)
---
Who gives a shit. He's like the husky starcraft of classic. Not really a bad thing.
---
This case would be a fallacy. There's no reason to think small changes would result in BFA in vanilla.
---
What a pathetic guy
---
Play something else than a warrior above level 20 and say it again.
---
Or maybe don‚Äôt fake sick to play video games, because you‚Äôre an adult.
---
I agree, there's just something..off about doing the same content on 4-5 different "difficulty modes".
---
Were you subbed the whole time?
---
I beat Resident Evil 1 and RE:2 around the age of 9. I was young enough to be afraid to play it in the dark
---
In the fifth grade, I destroyed Metal Gear Solid (3 discs!) 10 times on the same save file because I read on the internet you would get Grey Fox's katana -- you didn't
---
git gud
---
That too
---
With classic it's a weird because they are only well known from streaming private servers or creating leveling/gearing/attunment guides and interviewing good private server players. They aren't good players or even charismatic but there are only 4 or 5 really dedicated streamers and with all the hype they are guaranteed to get viewership.
---
I will buy the wallpaper engine today! So Awesome!!
---
Hahaha you guys hating on these streamers low key board as fuck. Get another hobby to keep you busy until classic man. Your shits all kind of whack
---
&gt; why would they send out invites to people who's not having a subscription, risking sending out betas to people who's not even active?
---
I mean you had to opt in for the classic beta like yesterday. Im pretty sure that people that opted in yesterday would be active if they would get the chance.
---
Hey, I played in ‚Äò04 and right now I‚Äôm in the 2nd grade.
---
Granted, I‚Äôm teaching it, but still.
---
Understandable, have a nice day
---
this won't fucking happen lmao, stop whining and go outside
---
Or basically just go in to pc world and buy anything today made by acer
---
That's not true at all.
---
And Tips reported it as bugged, saying he does "way too much damage"... I really hope Blizzard doesn't tune stuff like this down because of some BfA cry babies that can't deal with actual vanilla values. I remember this boss from back in the day, because he used to hit really hard. It was definitely not uncommon to wipe on him...
---
Minimun requirements for what ? BFA ? Legion ? Classic ?
---
Graduated in 2010. Worked for 8 years and went back in school 1 year ago.
---
we'll get through this together
---
Doctor here; played then and graduate tomorrow. Boards are in July and was looking forward to classic while I was prepping but the August date is likely for the best lol
---
In 40mans off healing is important. Ele shamans and balance druids are the best. Especially when looking at larger outdoor raids when the main healers start getting low on mana. Usually only needed near the end of the fight
---
BURT #NUR CHURNGES
---
It's feasible, yes, but it's also not much of a secret that there is a large amount of people who will claim to have actually played during Vanilla, but didn't just because it's the cool thing to be a part of. People like to fit in, so whether they never played, or did so on a private server, they will still say they played in 04/05.
---
I mean, they've said multiple times that they are intentionally recreating the bugs that existed in vanilla.
---
["It‚Äôs important to point out that there are some bugs we‚Äôre going to fix before launch, and there are some bugs that we don‚Äôt intend to address."](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-update/113138)

You mean I am not the part of the most ?

I played wow in 04 and am still in school in 19...as a teacher :)

Doesn't seem like the raptors either;

1) Looks for a proper path

2) Resets completely

This does seem like it can be abused.

Bu bU BuT mAh iMmErSiONn!!! cHAngE iSS bAd!!!
---
The new "fov" makes it look further than it is, kinda stupid tbh.
---
Why not just keep them in the game instead of removing them
---
Meh , I'd rather do that instead of waking up early and commuting everyday to a low wage job that wouldn't even be enough to sustain me . If you are even considered by companies for sponsorship it means you already have a huge following of viewers and donators .
---
I got in with the first wave. Just a normal player here. 
---
&gt;When did you opt in?
---
5/14/19
---
&gt;Are you a content creator?
---
&gt;How long has your sub been active?
---
2 Months
---
&gt;Are/were you actively playing BFA?
---
Yes, but very casually
---
&gt;Location(EU/US/etc)
---
US
---
&gt;When was your account created?
---
November 23, 2004. 
---
&gt;Did you play vanilla?
---
Yes. It appears that the only people allowed to play on the beta who didn't actually play vanilla are streamers/content guys.
---
TBH I'd rather have it consolidated here, to some extent, than a million individual posts on the sub saying the same thing. But, I'm trying to comb through and wipe out stuff that's irrelevant and plan to make a master list in the OP later.
---
They still didnt fix this from the Demo? Kek
---
Did he really? Not only is it normal damage like you said.. but Tipsout's armour was red, of course the boss is going to hit extra on him. Reporting problems that he has no clue about is just counterproductive
---
Oceanic rp-pvp is my pipe dream.

Since pvp without lag &gt;&gt;&gt; pvp with lag I think I'm gonna be that one nerd trying to add some light rp to my gaming and everyone being like "shut up looser"

"hey whats up guys it Tips here , today we are going to be going over &lt;Insert generic Classic subject&gt;, now I know that some of you have some questions about &lt;Insert generic Classic subject&gt;  and im going to speculate about &lt;Insert generic Classic subject&gt; and not actually form an opinion or even a coherent point of view.  In fact while iv been padding this introduction to &lt;Insert generic Classic subject&gt; it now allows me at add another advertisement to this video"
---
For BfA. Which means Classic too. They share the same rendering code.
---
This meme is so true that it hurts. So glad I get to return to vanilla under an officially run server soon üòÉ
---
Like I said, you obviously don't want to understand how layering works. Your own solution is just a terrible nonsensical form of layering that stacks random dead communities on top of eachother after the fact, and you're convinced it's a better solution just because it's not sharding or layering
---
If you really don't want layering to happen then grow up and be constructive, actually listen to what Blizzard's solution is and come up with one that isn't obviously just worse than what they're implementing. If you're just outraged or trolling because you don't have anything else going on in your life then scrape together some self-awareness and introspect. That's all I have to say.
---
1. World of Warcraft CLASSIC (The game that is coming out on the 27th of August) would never have been made without the content creators not Vanilla WoW
---
I know you guys like to pretend that there was this huge classic community before it was announced etc. (There was a decent chunk that played private servers but even before they were shut down, there were content creators for them)
---
but in reality you were a small % of the WoW playerbase that actually went far enough to play on a private server. Blizzard didn't give a shit about you then because you were nothing.
---
Nostalrius being shut down was the first time the classic community was relevant in terms of overall gaming news and thats the truth whether you like it or not. Content creators and streamers blowing it up played a monumental part in promoting the petition.
---
If you deny this you are delusional
---
2. I am not triggered I couldn't care less if someone insults a streamer. The thing that pisses me off is people being obtuse
---
?? What groups do you roll with where enjoying a different hobby to others and showing happiness and excitement for it is met with derision and is akin to committing social seppukku?
---
My colleagues and acquaintances, though never sharing the same hobbies have always just smiled and accepted that others have different hobbies.
---
I've never just shared my hobby with anyone outright, but the conversations have always come up and I've never been ashamed or tried to hide my hobby from others. Never been cringeworthy at all or treated that way at all. Always been treated with respect and I've returned the favour.
---
I'm sorry that the people you rub shoulders with are the type to consider you lower than them in your social circles because of your hobby. I do hope you come across more normal and understanding adults sometime in the future.
---
Wow you retarded
---
I graduate hs in '10, ran out of money for college in '13, and am now back in school to finish my degree. I started playing wow 2 months before BC
---
Yeah, kind of shitty for the sub to go for low-hanging fruit like this. It's like no veteran ever has made a mistake in wow after playing for 21+h straight
---
Doctors don't even spend that much time in college. They do an additional 4 years after undergrad and that's it. Their residency is full employment after graduation.
---
Posted an hour ago or so.
---
I'm 21 and in college, played vanilla when I was like 7 years old. Only get a couple weeks to no life it before my last year begins.
---
It's outdated information at best, the new information that it's based on 8.0 instead of 7.3.5 is a month old, and again, a barely relevant detail. You're acting like I said it was based on the frostbite engine or some shit
---
none of these people played mmorpgs before wow and have no idea how vanilla functioned. they claim to be experts because they can find videos online and cut them together and talk over them, yet none of these streamers are actually any good at the game except for maybe soda (who i don't like as a person btw). asfan and asmongold (who i like and started in 2006) who was a pretty staunch #nochanges player was starting to get very annoyed with how low the quest drop rates were and kept asking for them to be increased. a lot of these people keep A and D to turn left and right respectively and had no idea how to use vanilla abilities. i get it was 13 years ago for him but other streamers claimed to have played vanilla when they actually started in wotlk or cata. they did play on private vanilla servers so they think that makes them a vanilla player. as an actual vanilla player who started on day 1 and played UO and DAoC before wow came out, it was extremely frustrating to watch these people try to play vanilla. especially trying to watch staysafe play a warlock was extremely frustrating because even the simplest concept of keeping dots up on multiple mobs and properly using fear was too difficult for him to understand. to top it off, the only person i saw submit a bug report was asmongold and ONLY because his friend talking in the stream had to remind him that the reason he's in the beta is to submit bug reports to help the game.
---
It‚Äôs so bad that is so good.
---
Thanks. Yeah, I figured pservers were off, but I'm trying to gauge by how much.
---
Heinous
---
It says it in the announcement. 
---
-	You must have an active subscription or game time
---
-	You must also opt in under your account management 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be mean or anything, but that is what the announcement pinned to the top of this sub says. 
---
I‚Äôd imagine that that won‚Äôt be the case for the stress test, but it is for the beta. 
---
Similar to how you had to have a Blizzcon Virtual Ticket to play the demo last year.
---
NO. THAT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE. FALSE. WRONG. SORRY TRY AGAIN
---
that's incredibly false. You most people begin forming long term memories much earlier than 9. Especially for traumatic or *repeated* events. I very clearly remember getting stitches at age 6. I remember listening to Eminem in my friend's basement while playing roller coaster tycoon at 7. I remember sneaking onto my dads pc at 530 am to play Runescape at 9. Especially for those who are early 20-30s and finishing up uni, 9years old wasn't really that long ago. Now, will I remembers those moments as clearly in 50 years, maybe not but to say that people can't remember events 15 years ago from '04 just because they were 9 is idiotic.
---
The sad thing is, these retail people are going to quit bc its too hard, and then blizzard is going to get a bad data source for their studies and what not.  Instead of inviting people who quit because retail fuckin blows.
---
I doubt it. They‚Äôve emphasized that they won‚Äôt be retuning anything up or down. They‚Äôll probably just double check it against their 1.12 reference.
---
Explains all the "omg my vacation is over when release date hits"
---
People who played in their 20's when it first came out are like "Yea....and?"
---
Note that this is post nerfed damage also, early vanilla he did far more damage
---
[Infinite mob leash in WC?](https://clips.twitch.tv/SingleSpineyCatOpieOP) They don't seem to evade, instead they just pace back and forth and you can just safe-spot them.
---
Yep, that is why I like deadmines so much, Van Cleef is usually a very hard boss at the end, and small mistakes can easily cause wipes prior to that.
---
This post and all the comments are weird gatekeeping shit.
---
That's a really good question.  My intuition is no but my memory could be faulty.
---
Some hardliners would smack a 2004 calendar on their wall and mark the dates starting at 23.nov.2004 in 2019. They‚Äòd even cool the weather down to feel like the game released in november instead august. On top of that they would modify their identity card to pretend they are 14 again even tho they csnt buy any cigs and alcohol again.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs spell batching. However I‚Äôve heard reports that batching has been a little too generous in beta so things like this are happening more often. Not sure how accurate that is.
---
There is no agreed upon definition for "remaster". But in my opinion a remaster is when the developer actually updates the graphics and perhaps other things too. Like Warcraft 3 Reforged. Now, that's a remaster. :)
---
Still, the point is, there won't be graphical updates for Classic of the kind you hope for.
---
it was not in original game - so it's bug. It doesn't matter if people can add this by addons.
---
Still amazed by how many hours of joy I got out of going game over in the first handful of levels in basically every game. The patience man.
---
My niece gets bored quickly when she doesn't win, basjing my head against a wall like an idiot was pure bliss to me though (reignited with Dark Souls)
---
I may be permanently damaged but at least I got some patience and stamina.
---
This is pure gold

Yeah first test I believe is May 22-23rd. Next wed/Thursday

Was it the fucking murlocs?

It's technically tier 0

man, I bought his guide so many years ago. Legit bought it, I think that was the first time i ever legit bought something rather than pirate it (other than wow sub). Over the years though i lost the email, i can't even remember what email i used although i have a few guesses. My guide is lost to time :(
---
I think you can run it on a modern tablet
---
LoL need gnome.
---
They needed to save spots for TipsOut and Towelliee. What a fucking joke.
---
This guy definitely has blessing of wisdom running
---
Except you‚Äôre a cuck fuck
---
Wont happen
---
&gt; But in my opinion a remaster is when the developer actually updates the graphics and perhaps other things too.
---
Which is exactly what they're doing though? 4k resolution,  better engine, new lightning and shadow.
---
Jesus Christ what an entitled toddler, lmao.
---
its kinda cute how clueless and cocksure you are at the same time
---
if you had any idea how organized and unforgiving any of the historical precedents were and realized they gonna look like babby's first tryharding compared to actual classic armageddon
---
the more sinister option is that you are actually covering for one of the mafias by spreading misinformation but i wouldnt give you that much credit tbh
---
and your brilliant insight that its possible to corner a market when you let 66% of supply go unchecked, for convenience and a lolsorandom unexplainable abandonment of 66% of profits on top of that, just takes the cake
---
You‚Äôre a real weirdo
---
glad to see that at least one streamer is actually beta testing and not racing to lvl 30 for viewers
---
Crown of Destruction
---
I played in 04 and I'm considering going back into education at some point, so I'll be this guy too
---
A month old? November to today, 1 month. Lul
---
Wtf?!?11
---
Okay ty
---
I was in high school in 04, and now I'm in the middle of my college degree at age 31. I'm a late bloomer, but I fit.
---
&gt;  What point are you trying to make?
---
That it's not the bosses that dictate the difficulty of a race, it's the people you're competing against.
---
&gt; Also, an aside, you've conveniently NOT actually pointed out the mythic end bosses you've killed and linked me logs?
---
Because you literally linked the proof yourself, but you've seemed happy enough to dig through my logs to insult me, yet you're incapable of seeing that out of the two tiers I've played till the end since I came back in legion I killed the end boss in one of them.
---
&gt; Nope. I dropped the word "constantly" the second you got hung up on it for no reason. It isn't important nor relevant.
---
it's not no reason, the difference is very important. Do we agree that being able to move while casting provides an advantage over not being able to do so? Even in cases where you're not necessarily forced by the encounter to do so?
---
&gt; That classes in live having some kind of mobility actually allows for a buffer to mistakes. Rather than the content being tuned so that you need to use that mobility and thus you cannot use that mobility to counteract any mistakes because you then wouldn't have it for the required mechanic.
---
This is simply not true, take the instance of the rsham I was playing up till recently, how many of my instant casts can i realistically delay until a mechanic requires me to move?
---
I have a bunch 6-8 second windows in which I must use them, pandemic timer (which is another thing that's easier to manage in retail contra classic) for flame shock, gives me a 6 sec window where i must use it, no mechanic to dodge in that window? That's a global with free movement, same thing for lava surge procs, i have 6 sec to get the instant lava burst, and even then every global i delay it is a dps loss, hell cbt must be used at the correct time down to the second to get maximum value
---
True that
---
I read what you wrote, I was like "yep that's a good comment".
---
Then I saw the vote/karma counter.
---
I remember in the early days of classic cast, tips got laid off and he made a huge sob story post about him and his family and begged people for support .. it was that very moment that I went from "this is my least favourite guy" to "I really don't like this guy at all"
---
It's clear to me that if you are in a situation like that, you put your dreamy 15 year old game aspirations down and go out there to find a way to support your family, and not beg strangers for their support so you don't have to do real work, and continue making shitty youtube videos
---
I think it was joke, not sure did he really send it.
---
This hit home
---
Imagine playing FF14. Oooof
---
Look for any gear that's of the Eagle or of the Gorilla. Those are stam/int and str/int respectively. Super duper valuable for paladins.
---
I never played warrior in vanilla, so I cant say for certain.
---
Hahaha 3 empty ad-homenien replies in a matter of mins. Just look at this shit. 
---
Blizzbots need to update their AI.
---
Yeah and? Tipsout also said during his Irvine video that the regen rates were slow, and now he also agrees they're too fast in the beta.
---
Like, have you watched any beta footage since yesterday? People are near instantly regenerating to full after combat.
---
I mean, I started playing in ‚Äò04 and I‚Äôm back in school. And I‚Äôm having a dickens of a time finding anyone who played WoW at all. x.X
---
I think with some int gear you will be able to heal with your highest rank Flash of Light early on.  I usually don't down rank much when I'm lvling.  
---
The big thing with healing as a paladin while lvling is knowing when the dungeons jump up in difficulty.  Zul Farrak is the first "Hard" dungeon I would say.  The mobs start hitting harder to compensate for the tanks having plate or dire bear form.  This continues all the way into raids and everything hits harder.  Healing before this a huge effort.  You may even be able to apply seals and auto attack on these low level dungeons.
---
Using Hammer of Justice to stun is your best "heal".  It should be used on CD.  You are effectively giving the tank 100% reduced dmg for the duration.   You'd be surprised how often Blessing of Freedom comes up where the tank is slowed than loses aggro etc.  Also Blessing of Protection is great as well.  No other healing class has something like Blessing of Protection.  Other classes have protection spells such as Power Word: Shield but this doesn't make the mob ignore that player and go back to the tank.  The ability to turn off a player's aggro for several seconds is awesome.
---
I also prefer 31/20/0 because holy shock gives you that extra bite in PvP.  Unfortunately the heal portion of it is pretty horrible compared to Flash of Light.  Flash of Light scales better and heals better and cost alot less mana.  I almost never use Holy Shock to heal but I do use it with Divine Favor to get that guaranteed crit in pvp alot.  Being able to throw Consecration down stun judge DF-&gt;Holy shock is sometimes enough to kill people surprisingly.
---
Looking at the talent tree I would go all the way down to vengeance first 5/5.  Than personally I would get  repentance on a pvp server.  Otherwise it isn't super useful.  From there go into holy while lvling.  Retribution is a very solid lvling spec however it is slow.  With the paladin's kit though you usually never die and can even solo elites if you want to.
---
I use Lua frames but only once I start raiding.  You should use pally power once you are raiding in order to get all your blessings in order.
---
Yes, that's my point. In case of Warcraft they remade all the models, animations, cinematics, everything.
---
In case of Classic, they just updated the engine while keeping everything else original. You wouldn't call Diablo 2 LOD a "remaster" of Diablo 2 just because you could run the game in 800x600 resolution, instead of 640x480.
---
Ur brain is whack. Board? Sounding like an uneducated chump.
---
Not really, you wont be able to make up for that lost time for literally months.
---
My iMac 2011 doesn't support Metal and it's a requirement for BfA, I could install Windows to get around that but I haven't tried yet. GPU is a AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 512 MB GDDR5. I was able to play Legion without any problems with an Intel HD 4000 on my laptop, but ever since they made the new models mandatory it's unplayable for me.
---
I have heard that it was prominent people in the wow community and blizzard staff
---
I don‚Äôt even know what layering is for. 
---
And it this point I‚Äôm too afraid to ask.
---
What *you* think streamers experience will be: 
---
Running around in 40-100 man groups rolling everything and everyone they see. "Exploiting" and hopping from layer to layer to make mad money. 
---
What the actual streamer experience will be: 
---
Streamer trying to enjoy the game and getting ganked by multiple groups of people just for the lols on stream and the streamer hopping from layer to layer just so he can do anything but those people try to follow him just to keep ganking him 24/7.
---
I think EVERYONE'S foggy memory of Vanilla will be more work than pserver crowds.
---
Post the video then.
---
No! If you didn't play vanilla you aren't allowed here!
---
Jk my man, of course! Get your butt in here! Healing is fun and can be tough, it can also be mundane. But all the healing classes are viable -- priest, druid, paladin (Alli), shaman (horde)

According to [this 2006 WoWWiki article](https://web.archive.org/web/20060901221803/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas%3AHealth_Regen), health regen is supposed to tick every 2 seconds. Perhaps server lag causes the ticks to lag as well? I can't remember if they still processed client side or not.
---
Who fucking cares man..jesus. This is really akin to complaining that the servers are too stable and not disconnecting at peak hours makes you feel like you're playing retail.
---
Graphics don't make the game. I do not care how graphics look. I'm also partially colorblind and and would appreciate this option as well
---
I put school on hold so I could raid more in Wrath. 
---
 It was a communications degree...I made the right decision...
---
Dying to a sub level 10 mob
---
&gt;*Pathetic*
---
Don't play BfA you might not even wanna play classic after lmaooo
---
Define "played"
---
Staff of shadowflame
---
Hey its teebling from Barrenschat yall
---
Just because you're too inept to do it, doesn't make it the same for everyone else.
---
All I know is that I don't like T-1000 water.

fuck that warrior died so fast !!!!
---
If alliance, it would be those goddamn defias looters
---
Haha. Sad times.
---
Amazing that even this needs/s
---
Or new laws will cause twitch to die out, people growing out and not worshipping random people, at some point it will be gone
---
I received the beta invite.
---
* Opted in a couple days ago (14 May?)
---
* Sub inactive for years (bought 30 days game time just after opting into beta)
---
* Was not playing BFA (last login was like 2011 - earlier?)
---
* Location: EU
---
* Account creation: 2004 (I beta tested the original game)
---
* Played vanilla off and on (probably subbed a total of 12 months since game's '04 release)
---
Yes a month ago, feel free to link your source if you want to prove me wrong. The first confirmation that it's now based on 8.0 came from the upload to the CDN (a month ago).
---
The funniest is when it's the #nochanges people that are literally too young to have played classic.
---
My account is from wrath and I got access
---
Lol imoltate.
---
If you go to FSU you def spending at least 5 on that Bachelors. No reason to leave.
---
same, but replace WotLK with Cata.
---
Joana didn't even get an invite, and one could say that he probably has the most extensive knowledge for a lot of things as he literally researched vanilla leveling when it was current and has a 1-60 video to reference. The beta is a joke
---
What exactly is the point of pointing out things that are wrong with class specs when nothing will change?
---
I want to say no but I'm so impulsive when I'm bored
---
If someone offered to release classic rn if I chopped off my own toe it would honestly be something, I'm ashamed to say, I'd consider because I'm impatient as FUUUck
---
I stood outside gamestop when I was 14 for the midnight release of the original world of warcraft. I was already a Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, ROC and TFT player. My first Blizzard game was Warcraft 2: Battle.net edition followed by years of Diablo 2. With that being said, I LOVE the current state of wow BFA and I'm also very hyped for Diablo Immortal. My wife and I enjoy playing wow together everyday. While I'm at work, I'm stuck playing PUBG mobile because it's the only thing out there. I'd much rather be playing a Blizzard Diablo game. I am now 30 years old and it might be an unpopular opinion but I still love Blizzard just like I did as a teenager.
---
It used to happen all the time, we actually had a meme for that on german realms "heal war durch"
---
Jesus this hit me like a train.
---
not their decision
---
It's all about the class fantasy for me
---
Colorblind options are confirmed.
---
Can confirm. Was also 9 when I played and am 24 now.
---
Tip was level 19 with a red chest piece and Soda didn't heal him
---
I don‚Äôt care for Tips as much as the next guy and I HAVE been playing since Vanilla AND years in private servers and I STILL get lost in that bitch.
---
Classic misdirection.
---
Same... and I still don't to this day.
---
Setting water quality to low should fix that
---
I seriously doubt they're being paid to play.
---
Just being able to stream the beta and have insider knowledge before normal people can play it is a huge marketing boost to their channel.
---
But yeah, people like Towellie and Soda are going to be burnt out very fast.
---
^One ^of ^us

#One of us#
---
I think they were prepared for this after the "OMG!!111 Warlock summoning is borked in demo!" thing. Memories are foggy and pservers are wrong. The golden reference client will decide. I imagine most of their time will be spent vetting reports, lumping similar ones together, and then testing on reference.
---
Nah, nothing started being threatening till like lvl 12.
---
Seemed like all of those people reported getting an email in the evening (which are often late) but it's likely they were given access at the same time as everyone else. I hope I'm wrong though because I'd sure like to see some more invite waves...
---
Nobody is complaining about colorblind mode. Last I heard it was confirmed for Classic.
---
I'd be surprised if Classic doesn't get a "reforged/remastered" option at some point. It didn't ruin Starcraft, presumably it isn't ruining WC3.
---
Give them both access?
---
Ill be playing a fair amount, though certainly not speed leveling or paying attention to /played.  Ill be doing professions, stopping to smell the roses, do dungeons, etc.
---
Ill be just shy of 30 when Classic releases.  I have a job that means im gone almost 11 hours per day.  I just cant treat WoW like a job these days, and i dont *want* to.  
---
Unfortunately im still looking for a guild :(  Its kind of shocking to me just how *few* guilds seem to be using the 'traditional' Tuesday/Thursday night raid schedule.
---
super dope
---
lmao this type of thread happens EVERY time in every new game that comes out and "beats" Fortnite/League etc. in views for a few days maybe weeks.
---
Not like you people don‚Äôt know this already, but it‚Äôs sad to see it confirmed on a daily basis that numbers are the only thing that matters. 
---
Just keep your heads down, bob and weave until release then ignore all of these ‚Äòpersonalities‚Äô
---
Characters fully turned. You used to be able to bug out the animation and 'moonwalk'.
---
I can't take time off cuz otherwise I couldn't stay subbed lol 
---
Not in a rush anyways, the game will be there after work hopefully
---
Graduated college in 2010.  I'm old.
---
I fucking wish I was still in school.  Life was way simpler.
---
Yeah it seemed like a significant amount of the normal people that were invited were day 1 players.
---
according to /u/COHL7500 they are confirmed
---
No, but someone who never played during real vanilla clearly can't possibly have firsthand knowledge. Limiting to people who at least potentially might have played actual original WoW seems like an improvement.
---
Maybe they played a lot on an older family member/friends account when they were like 4 or 5 lol.
---
I watched this so many times back in the day that I still remember most of it by heart.
---
It's especially sad when "going out and doing things" translates specifically to a bar and drinking copiously for no reason in particular as often as possible.
---
You mean August 13th... gotta get your name saves.
---
Which is quite strange as the target demographic for Classic is higher than nowadays fellow kids...
---
Agreed.
---
Its super painful to watch players who just aren't that good gameplay wise.
---
FFXIV is a solid game. No need to bring another game down to build ours up.
---
If you‚Äôre watching TipsOut‚Äôs video, he shows colorblind options as well.
---
And?
---
I think you missed my point. I am glad to hear that colorblind options are confirmed though
---
I'm right there with you with hating on the big streamers but I doubt the devs are looking at twitch chat mob mentality, or even Reddit for that matter
---
No offense to the streamers who have it but he'd probably have better input than most if not all of them. Speedrunning a game gives you such intricate knowledge of it. 
---
Can't imagine all the little unique pieces of info this guy has on quests and mechanics around the world
---
Classic client has options for updated shadows, and higher ground clutter density+distance. It also still retains the grass moving as you run through it from the modern client (which Classic is built off of).
---
You‚Äòre absolutely right. I mistaked! On reddit I just wrote that it will be released end of 2019 (and got downvoted for). I am sorry for my false statement
---
Totally agree with you. I really don't like all this elitism im seeing from the classic community
---
Colorblind ui mode is in and can adjust the strength. For color blind mode for overall graphics I could not find it in n the options.

Bless!
---
Nmplol is 7
---
Taurens are the thing that made me want to play the game way back when.
---
 Story time!
---
 I was hanging out watching my friend play "this new game" he was into when he said that the city was being raided. Him and several other dwarves, humans and elves all piled up in the tram station waiting to ambush the raiders. 
---
 I was bored to tears and always thought this game looked really stupid until I saw the vanguard of the raid...A tauren warrior.
---
 I wasnt familiar with warcraft lore or any of the races so I had never seen anything like it. "What the hell is that?!" I asked him. "Oh, uh...a tauren" he said like I had just asked if the sky was still blue. 
---
 "Is that a person? Like, that's another player?" "Yeah. This whole raid is" 
---
 Instantly, I was hooked. I went home that night and ordered me a computer (Dell dimension 9100. My first computer and only prebuilt). Within 3 weeks I was in the world. I tried to play alliance to be with my friends that played but being new, them being 40+ and not playing with me, it got stagnant and boring real fast.
---
 My last ditch attempt to see if the game was worth playing was to strike out on my own. I chose a different server (one that a webcomic artist I liked had a guild on), made my tauren druid and spent the next few years making friends, having adventures and forging the absolute best memories. 
---
 I still play to this day and have been subbed almost the entire time since my first day (I started right before the patch that Dire Maul came out in dropped) and Scarhoof has followed me all along the way.
---
 He's not always been my main and he's gone by many names and changed from tauren, to NE, to troll to worgen over the years but he always winds up on whatever server I've settled on. 
---
 I'm looking forward to having Scar be reborn as a warrior this go around and carry on the legacy of fun and friendship that I remember from all those years ago.
---
 Sorry for the long post. I'm feeling wistful and nostalgic what with all the classic videos flying around.
---
 Thanks for sticking with my story. See you all in the barrens.
---
/r/takeadamnscreenshot
---
Played day 1, almost continuous sub and played every expac but no invite. It would be nice to try it out before release but either way i‚Äôll get to play it at some point!
---
People who played nothing but private servers are perhaps the worst people to be beta testing. Half of their "bugs" are just private server quirks.
---
Maybe the majority.
---
I'm not friends or family or anything to do with streaming or promoting. The thing is, at least last night the servers were both low pop. I know it's day one but if they plan a stress test next week more invites have to go out.
---
Sit crits were a bug in Vanilla and got patched somewhere around 1.8 with some paladin changes, one of the many things pservers kept for some dumb reason
---
My brother is still in school and we have played since day one...BA, MA, now working on PhD...
---
Between gnomer and dun morogh in the mountains is a skip that drops you into wetlands and you can spirit Rez at menethil. No running through loch or wetlands.
---
That last sentence feels so menacing.
---
To each their own :) Im just not very immersed when farming the same mobs for gold for a mount, or farming materials etc.
---
Unless you're a 50-59 Warrior, then Classic on PvP servers has an enrage mechanic called phase 2.
---
J/k. I reckon it might actually be cool to slug through those hunting grounds.
---
Tank wasn't full health.
---
Pulled when healer wasn't full mana.
---
Healer was DPS-ing.
---
Wipe.
---
God that's nice to see.
---
And it's not as if he was 1-shot, there was plenty of time to top up between the (very slow) boss attack swings.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Is it bad that I alphabetize my characters?
---
I was 12, so I played but no hardcore raiding for this squeaker
---
I just watched the vod, he actually sent in the report. On-top of that, he pulled the boss when nobody was ready and like I said before he had a red chest and waist.
---
That's just sad..
---
I played in Germany on German servers and I think most of the players here were at least 16+ when playing in 04, which makes them 31+ now. I think that very young kids playing on the internet, on a PC, in a MMORPG wasn't as much of a thing here as it might have been in the US. Maybe they let a younger sibling click around for a bit when the parents didn't look. Age restriction was much of a thing here and WoW was seen as a somewhat violent game in Germany for some time and controversial. Whenever I see these childrens rooms with multiple PCs and these young faces, then I am always irritated.
---
Great username
---
Windows 10 has colorblind options in the accessibility settings too, but they aren't as comprehensive as I would like them to be.
---
Guess well have to agree to disagree?
---
I wouldn't hold my breath for any graphic updates... ;)
---
(It's a *lot* of work. Unless Blizzard can charge for it, they won't do it. And I'm not sure there is enough demand for that.)
---
Got chuckle, take an upvote.
---
I forgot to add that they will invite in waves in the next couple of weeks
---
Is this a new feature?! I don't think it's in Retail.
---
Stuff like isn't database data so there was a good chance it was bug in the demo, anyone who reported it was right to report it. However, anyone who reports that mob has too low armor or hits hard, is probably wasting everyone's time since damage and armor are database data.
---
I played in 05 and am still in school. Was in jr high then, in college now. It‚Äôs really not an unknown thing.
---
My biggest issue with bfa is the pvp. If I'm going to spend 20 days play time I better see some results when I play against someone who just hit level cap. I hate dampening. I want to two shot people again.  It's why I put so many hours into diablo 2 and barely played diablo 3.
---
fire is viable, it doesn't have the aoe blizz has. on crowded servers when aoe isn't really viable then fire is better at single target dps. either way though you won't have a problem lvling as fire
---
I'm thinking of leveling multiple characters at once. Taking my time with them.
---
But they're probably all going to be skinning/mining/herbalism. Maybe a tailor for bags.
---
I do love me some gold.
---
Tauren got long arms
---
&gt; Diablo 2 LOD 
---
That's an expansion, do you even understand what you're talking about?
---
I mean ofc it's going to slow you down massively compared to AoE farming on frost. Viable? Yeah, you can do it, but the problem with mages is mana regen and downtime. You'll be able to clear through, just expect to drink a ton.
---
Well you have to remember that all of us vanilla vets are perfect in every way.
---
Rename sharding to layering.  
---
One of Blizzard more clever PR stunts.
---
is the beta locked at lvl 30 ?
---
I dont think anyone is really expecting to get in except the streamers? I sure am not.
---
This gave me chills. Both times I read it.
---
&gt; It all equalises in the end.
---
you, an enlightened liberarian: "the market will fix it! do
---
reality: a guild worth of discord mafia tryhards colludes with another to get [#of layers] times more stock to corner the market for [#of layers] more months at a low cost of having to share the profits with a few more dudes
---
what a huge sacrifice to have infinite gold, im sure the high-minded discord bros would never do this
---
Yes this clip made me very happy. No faceroll :)
---
Not my fault you read things into it that aren't there. OP posted a picture from the cinematic, so I mention the cinematic. If it hurts to read so much, then downvote and move along.
---
I was 11 when I started playing and raiding got through ZG, MC, BWL, AQ20, AQ40 just couldn't get that Naxx till TBC came out but I paid Illidan a visit before quitting the game can't wait for classic.
---
not really. if you're a min-maxer then blackcrow is objectively better, albeit very slightly
---
Along with them actually needing beta testing, I could see a lot of these people never getting bored of classic. Big streamers.. okay you have a point there.
---
But theres some serious vanilla fanatics out there man. The people who have rerolled every pserver over the past 10 years and gone to 60+ and through all raid tiers are what im talking about
---
Tank reported it as a bug immediately after. "Boss did way too much damage" lmao
---
&gt;Ur
---
My hero
---
Yeah, so prob not right? Like I don't wanna spend an extra 6 or 10 hours from 1-60 just cuz I like shooting fire out of my hands lmao thanks for the answer
---
Do you think there are enough older players who quit then to make up that large of a playerbase? 
---
I started playing this game in 2005, I was 14 then and had all the time in the world. I'm 28 now and I know for an absolute fact that I will not be able to squeeze in enough time in my day for classic wow. I work between 8-17 every weekday, I have two hours commute in total. Part of my daily routine is a bit of exercise and cooking dinner until I'm entirely free for the evening at around 19.30-20.00. By 22 I gotta be in bed, otherwise I'll be a zombie at work. And that is all assuming I don't go off for any social events with friends, family or coworkers.
---
Basically everyone I know bar maybe three people - two of whom are currently studying at university - have said the same thing. Between work, families and our social lives, we don't really feel like we're going to have enough time to play this game much. Hell I barely have enough time to play the live game, and it is much more accessible in terms of time spent/things done.
---
Now I do know that me and the people I know are not representative, we're just a small group of people. But I feel like vanilla was always suitable for a younger audience. A lot of us here were very young back then. Are enough of the teens and early twenty-somethings going to enjoy classic wow, enough to overshadow the live game in the long run? I'm not sure... 
---
My gut feeling is that Blizzard would be happy with a long term classic wow playerbase of about 80-100k players. Which would be a pretty huge success in my opinion. Nowhere near the live game, not even in the same stratosphere as the peak of vanilla wow itself but still a small, dedicated playerbase.
---
His point is that this isn‚Äôt an issue. Private servers were wrong.
---
I don't hate streamers. I dont really like the attitude of their chats
---
Sure it works i have done it.
---
It‚Äôs just that you will have a lot of downtime drinking pretty much all the time!
---
Don't worry, they know about this. They know about mail box too. And they explicitly said they won't dedicate ressource to fix those things because it is 100% unimportant.
---
Alright thx
---
Honest question, has anybody recovered an sold account?
---
I 'sold' mine back in the day but not really for a big cash out was just that I was quitting and gave it away to a guildies brother.
---
I would really like to recover it but am struggling if I should try since I don't want to take the account away if he by chance is still using it. I mean its been 14 years so unlikely but still.
---
I mean does it negatively affect people in any way? If someone wants to feel cool let them. It‚Äôs not hurting anyone to let them pretend to have played back then so they‚Äôll feel good about themselves for a minute. Let the people have their fun.
---
Imagine being.... you. oooooof
---
Go fire and prioritize spirit, I'ved leveled 4+ mages.
---
I think if you‚Äôre under 26 you didn‚Äôt really get to appreciate Vanilla wow, and you never really will. That being said I appreciate anyone who wants to get into classic when it comes out and treat it as a great blizzard game!
---
Bandwidth. I don't have the player base numbers, but counting chinese players is always hard.
---
I actually did play back in 2004 but sadly my current account was made in 2007.
---
14 has a pretty good story, problem is is that it feels like a glorified single player game, there‚Äôs almost no need for partying outside of instances, and even then most players just stream roll through then leaving almost no time for any interaction outside of ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù
---
Absolutely fantastic soundtrack though. Seriously
---
You get a sir bonus? 14 years and TIL
---
This man gets it.
---
Started playing aged 9, just finishing my masters degree right now. I submit my thesis around launch and have no job lined up so my timing is spot on üëåüèº
---
Yeah it quite obvious! Every famous streamer has an beta key.
---
They‚Äôre all going for leveling/fun it seems. Lol
---
What kind of work do you do? I need to get in that field if it has management like that!
---
Fire probably has the best mana regen because pyroblast being your opener having a high spell cast allows for more mana regen.  It does so much damage you don't really need spell dmg.  The issue is on higher levels every thing gets more health and fire kind of doesn't work.  You don't kill the mob fast enough and you don't have any shields so you die alot.  Now frost doesn't do as much damage but the synergies of frosting them and getting critical strike ends up doing more damage and allows you to live.  Fire is probably a better single target spec until lvl 30ish.
---
I can't speak for other people. But there's nothing wrong with wanting to like Vanilla WoW. I'm not a gatekeepers at all. But there isn't any real reason to lie about what you've played. I know a guy who is 20 and claims to have been playing and raiding since Vanilla. Like... No. No he wasn't. He can love the game all he wants and be happy with the private servers he played. But he was not raiding AQ 40 at 6 years old.
---
I'm all for Classic being huge and attracting a ton of people. But there's no reason to be disingenuous just to be "cool".
---
‚ÄúHard boss.‚Äù Just jump on cannon to make adds evade. ‚ÄúReal hard boss.‚Äù
---
Well, hunters are in the lucky place where all 3 specs have a place in PvP.
---
BM: great when leveling. Your pet is ridiculously strong and before you have your full toolkit to keep distance the pet can help you keep up damage. At 60 before you got any gear it can also work, but it does not scale too well.
---
MM: Great at 60 from the start and scales well with gear. Overall a great spec for end game PvP.
---
SV: more utility vs melee compared to MM.
---
In general, once you hit 60 and especially once you get a bit of gear you will mostly play MM or SV in PvP. Which one depends on what you prefer, many people like to switch a bit between them.
---
What's your estimate to complete this project?  I won't hold you to the estimate, I just need a SWAG.
---
Spot on!
---
The skill reduction was 100 back in the day which is actually 20(!) levels of reduction.  The saving grace was that it was random which one it impacted and it had a wide range (I think most weapon skills, defense, and at least the mage magic skills).
---
The tank having this debuff and getting the defense portion to proc was almost a death sentence as every attack was practically guaranteed to crit or crush.
---
Rolling a healer and flunking classes irl doesn't make you a doctor.
---
The best 1v1 PvP spec is probably grabbing scatter shot and intimidation. Others may disagree, but bestial wrath is very strong too.
---
Has anyone confirmed that Lupos is indeed physical damage on the beta yet? That could have a big affect on PvP specs.

One thing I would like to globally note was how Warriors actually had their HP regen benefit from Spirit nerfed in TBC (at least, according to this [WoWWiki 2007 article](https://web.archive.org/web/20071220053403/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Health_Regen)). Because of this, Warriors roughly healed at 62.5% of the effectiveness that they had in Vanilla - still higher than other classes, but the difference would've likely been less noticeable. 
---
In Vanilla, they definitely had a big advantage.
---
Maybe you don't play many online games, but the peak of players is in the first 2 week after launch, leater peaks are really rare. Blizzard will observe the population trend and if needed it will find a way, maybe opening new servers and making free transfers like back in the old days. (And some queue to join overpopulated servers... vanilla like)
---
Thats easy, they just need to watch Joana's 1-60 youtube video from back in Vanilla and tune in the things to be just like from the video.  ez
---
The way they worded it, my guess is the short ‚Äòmass tests‚Äô are going to be open beta days.  Point of the mass tests are to stress the hardware.  Thats difficult to do with small amounts of closed beta users.
---
"I need a scholarly essay attached to every Reddit comment reeeee"
---
It's obvious to anyone who watches the beta footage. Warriors shouldn't be able to take on 3 equal level mobs and survive with half health. Rogues shouldn't be the fastest levels because they never miss attacks.
---
Everyone should play how I like to play by default
---
As a gnome completing quest last night in the starter zone I was getting both gnome and iron forge rep
---
Omg, him repeatedly trying to LoS those fireballs was killing me.

I played in 2006 and I‚Äôm still in college
---
Holy crap, I'm in. My bnet account goes to a nonstandard email that I rarely check, but after seeing your posted I checked the blizzard app and sure enough I had the option to install Classic Beta.
---
FWIW, I was unsubbed from retail until the announcement that beta players were going to be selected from subscribers, at which point I re-subbed for 6 months. This is my original WoW account that I used since retail opening day, but it's been unsubbed since 2-3 months into BfA.
---
Issue: Beta Server Invite  
---
Discussion: The incurring problems is every time I check my email account I haven't received my Beta invite yet to WoW Classic.
---
I started mashing buttons on world of Warcraft when I was six in 2006. I have very vague memories of how it used to be. I can‚Äôt remember too much from before Wrath
---
Right so if you compare the two and they match then it's accurate.
---
Didn't the Allies (BfA) end up winning this battle?
---
It took out the gauss man come on. Can't have too much of that gauss.
---
Not a bug
---
I went back to Uni at 30 cause I needed a new direction. So I'll have more than enough time to play WoW thankfully.
---
Other people have pointed this out but... It's not really *hard* per-se; no. What people mean by that is that without properly planning your pills while leveling you may have to fight 2 or more. Which for some classes at some points means you are fucking dead.
---
In retail of course it's basically impossible to die while leveling.
---
Surely you can see the difference here and why people might just say it's hard or at least harder rather than go through that full explaination.
---
Definitely was a freshman in high school when beta turned into live. Played through all the chaos and good times. As much as I want to like what blizzard has done to the game, I hate it equally.
---
Tips' gear was all red if I'm not mistaken, that's why he got blasted like that.
---
My vanilla brain says tauren have increased melee range over other races.
---
POV from the tank: https://clips.twitch.tv/HandsomeRefinedKimchiHumbleLife
---
- Notice how he pulled without telling the healer. 
---
- Healer was too far away to actually heal him. 
---
- Healer wasn't at 100% mana. 
---
- No other DPS were attacking the boss because it was basically a ninja pull. 
---
- The tank doesn't have a chest piece because it was broken. 
---
- The tank didn't use demo shout. 
---
- The tank wasn't even looking at his screen nor did he have his hands on the keyboard when he died because he was reading chat.
---
Oh and Tips won a really good cloak earlier in the run and destroyed it then clipped himself destroying it and sent it to the group to troll them. Not even kidding: https://clips.twitch.tv/VainObeseNigiriPoooound 
---
I watched this entire run and Tips might the worst player playing this beta right now: https://clips.twitch.tv/CourteousCulturedWaffleYouWHY
---
Someone should test this in beta. Did it require wall walking?
---
Reporting in.
---
u me?
---
Upvote for Goldshire Retrievers in the pie chart

I‚Äôm just saying if someone wants to claim they played back then and raided it‚Äôs not really hurting anyone that they‚Äôre lying about that. Just let them lie about it and move on. If they‚Äôre lying al they‚Äôre doing is hurting their own integrity which is their own problem not yours. I get that it‚Äôs annoying when people lie about stuff like whether they played a game back then but I just don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs angering so many people when it doesn‚Äôt affect them in any way at all.
---
I definitely don‚Äôt remember drinking after every pull, maybe every two to three pulls.
---
I have a terrible fucking memory (especially short term, but also some long term blank spots) but at least from 3rd grade on is clear as day. It‚Äôs less reliable earlier than that, but I‚Äôd still say through kindergarten is somewhat reliable. Before that it‚Äôs a whole lot of brain fog and false memories due to stories I was told later in life. 
---
People can DEFINITELY remember 9 years old with considerable accuracy.
---
And here you are imagining in this post what other people you don't know might be imagining in their bug reports about what their memories might be imagining about what authentic Vanilla was like. I imagine you're quite bored.
---
This is why I laugh when streamers get sniped. GOOD! Griefers are doing the lord's work
---
lmao its ok id never go back to school even if they paid me to, happy with my current job
---
Yes you gain 33% bonus regen, that's why char usually sit while eating etc for the RPG aspect.
---
But I'm not sure if this is on the Beta because there isn't the 100% chance to get critd while sit
---
Well I mean people bug reported warlocks in the demo for not having "summoning disorientation" and demons auto-dismissing as soon as you cast to summon another.
---
Hopefully Blizz will do what they did then and double check. I hope they can fire up a 1.12.1 internal server to compare whether or not it actually plays out or if values need to be tweaked.
---
Fire is more fun and better at PVP imo until you get frost barrier.  If youre on a pvp server you will win every single 1v1 because sheep&gt;pyro&gt;fireball&gt;fireblast&gt;blastwave will 100-0 most everyone.
---
I like this guy
---
Except when he pretends to be knowledgeable about classic when he clearly is getting that info from a third party...
---
Omg starshards &lt;3 after they took that away I switched from holy to shadow.
---
Spotted the brit
---
Yeeep you changed my mind.
---
wow, wild, almost like when u exploit the encounter it becomes easy
---
LOL did he really report that as a bug? The mistakes his party made were obvious from the clip be OP posted. And I didn't think my respect for classic YouTubers could get any lower.
---
Sure, but the default setting should be vanilla graphics.
---
fish are not blind
---
Dam that hitbox is bigger than my fat ass wtf
---
Surprise surprise it's the private server players that people complain about that are actually testing stuff.
---
its more methodical you cannot be braindead and pull 3-4 mob at the same time like retail wow. IF you pull more then you're suppose to run for your damn life.
---
Only husky actually played sc 1and 2 decently.
---
And FREAKING FIREBALLS OUT OF YOUR HAAAANNNDSSSSSS
---
Do you not understand the point of a bug report?
---
On air they see VERY VERY bad.
---
Hell, classic is what got me back into WoW after leaving the game shortly after MoP launched. Currently leveling a Tauren paladin to kill time till classic launches
---
I mean, some people go back to school when they are older. Or after getting out of the military. Or just going back to school to get a second degree. Or med school. Oh graduate school.
---
Lots of reasons.
---
Is +3 agi on the bow 1.12? I remember it as +9 on PS
---
Fair points thanks for the input
---
Can't PvP without scattershot. That's 21 pts into MM pretty much mandatory. So you could play 30/21/0 but you get all the BM cake without the cherry on top. You do have scattershot + intimidation though.
---
Personally I would go 0/21/30. Just too many juicy tricks in survival to ignore. Deflection + deterrence + counter attack, entrapment, survivalist, surefooted, improved wing clip.
---
Yeah it's good...I'm still going enjoy stream sniping though
---
Except when it does. I've had conversations with people that will say things that are blatantly wrong, because they didn't actually play and call them out. They double down. This is everyone, but if you never played but argue points about the original game because you played a private server, that is angering. It's like people saying raiding in Vanilla was so easy. I mean yeah, the content is easy nowdays. Shit wasn't back then.
---
I really want to read more on this. Where can I find these things? Her tradechat videos would be a lot to sift through.
---
I legitimately have no clue what you are even talking about.
---
If they match... visually?
---
The 7.3.5 modified client and the 1.12 client look the same in game, but they operate very differently under the hood
---
They might open it up towards the end, but I'm not holding my breath. 
---
Either way, I'm not going to subscribe for a sub 1% chance at a beta key, so I'm never getting one.
---
Please, what do you even know about the whatever?! 
---
I‚ÄôVE been playing since vanilla alpha, BEFORE the whatever was even implemented in patch 0.0.1.
---
That‚Äôs not even true. As soon as the first raid came out, you didn‚Äôt even need to do the reps unless you wanted to.
---
So what?  Yeah you may not like his content in terms on classic, but dude... he at the very least is a classic fan and has been excited about it from day one.  He will actually be way more likely to do stuff like report bugs and actually test stuff out because he loves the game.
---
There are people who got it who have been hating on classic since day one.
---
You destroyed him.
---
It has downsides yeah, but in the current understanding they are minimal, we'll have to see with high number of players during the beta if it causes more problems than it solves. At this point, the people complaining about it have almost no logical basis to complain aside from it existing at all and any version of it will be hated because these people will bitch about anything that is slightly different from their memory of vanilla even if said memory is different from reality (or simply skewed towards remembering only the good things)
---
Grad school is a cruel bitch.
---
You think League is the biggest game by bandwidth?
---
Are you high right now? How do you even know how much bandwidth each game exchanges? What kinda weird flex is that?
---
One of the most confusing comments I‚Äôve ever read in my entire life.
---
I was 18 when wow came out, yeesh that's a kick in the nuts.
---
I'm considering going back to Uni again sometime soon. With credits from previously earned degrees I could knock out a degree in a year and a half. Don't forget that people do post graduate study later in life sometimes.
---
I was doing AQ20, BWL, ZG at the time. There's still plenty of juice to squeeze left for me. Ive been in AQ40 on a private server or two over the years. But it just never has that feeling of permanance to it. So I'm happy that I'll have as long as I like to get to that point in classic.
---
Entering the dark portal and getting quest greens in the first 20 minutes that absolutely trounced the purples I'd earned was such a kick in the teeth.
---
nah dude, it takes 30 minutes to start playing vanilla right now. Nobody talks out of memories
---
Depends on the object, I had a warrior in vanilla and could for sure charge around rocks and trees and certain objects in my path.
---
The last two expansions launches from my experience have not had any issues that kept me playing on launch day. Not saying there won't be, but I'm not sure if it's that cut and dry.
---
So you got an invite? Can you tell us when you started WoW or anything you don‚Äôt mind sharing so we know how closely they are following the criteria they claim to be following? If not that‚Äôs fine too.
---
*laughs in free European BSc and MSc*
---
people just talking with their chat
---
How is this a bug my friend? If anything, this is a fix. Plus its a joke. Jeeez
---
I just went back and took three classes in the evening for work. I wouldn't say I'm a student, but I think that's technically "full time".
---
The way they make it sound, is they are only going to school during the day. That seems a bit weird around 30.
---
1.12 addons will not work. The game has some subset of retail API for addons.
---
Started 10th grade 2004
---
played nearly every day till cata
---
couldnt afford school, so i worked.
---
didnt go to college until i was 28
---
now almost 30 but halfway through school.
---
class starts 1 week before release.
---
There's a common thread between all of these guys playing like shit and it's from spending half their time trying to read chat.
---
Yet Shroud gets an invite while talking about how "dead the game will be in 2 weeks"
---
No I've not had chance. In the interviews they said it was a lot slower than Private Servers. Bit weird for them to suddenly say it's too fast considering they never noticed Private Servers were too fast, where are they suddenly comparing it to?
---
The thing that is the same as with sharding is that you lose the feeling of just accidently running into the same people all the time, getting that community sense going on. Even running into the same enemies.
---
Specific Example.
---
When I played in Vanilla I remember 1 specific alliance (enemy) warrior that always seemed to play when I did in the same zones. Sometimes we played together finishing a q, or when others got involved we fought each other. This happens even more with people of your own faction without spam-friend-inviting all of them.
---
If your layer stays constant per playsession, every day will still be roulette whether you will meet anyone you've seen before. And as someone who started playing then, and will now again do so, without friends, this really does change the feeling. That it's 'just a few weeks' while better than longer, still for quite some people might mean the entire leveling experience of their first character.
---
And that beginning is the most important 'immersion and feeling' - wise (at least for some of us).
---
So, while I understand layering and that it is not entirely the same as sharding, it doesn't change what for me has been shardings most core flaw, and that at the (according to me) moment it matters the most.
---
I'm expecting so hard, that if I don't get in, I will shit my pants on twitch, name of the stream: Holy sh*t I'm disappointed.
---
You've said there are better ways to do this a couple times. What are those better ways?
---
It‚Äôs just a beta.
---
Welcome to min maxing and competitive play. Either way it easier than mythic +.
---
I won't shit on them for not playing perfect. They are on a 15h+ streaming marathon. Wiping? Getting lost in WC? All good fam.
---
But when you're so delusional that you think getting 2-hit by a dungeon boss with higher level than you while wearing half-broken gear is a bug AND ACTUALLY REPORT IT - god damn, what a mess
---
A level 4 warlock with life tap? He's at least lvl 6.
---
my b didn't see that one
---
I like this because it fixes my craziness.
---
smashing that button really fast was lots of fun.
---
I mean, I played back in 2005, I was 12 at the time. People go to school still when they are 28 sometimes, depending on how long they are studying. It's totally possible if you ask me. I however choose to work instead of studying, just starting my 3rd year at this company this month.  
---
So nothing suspicious about stories like this I'd say. :3
---
They litterally Said it was different...
---
Electromagnetic fields from outside sources could make CRT screens get discolored. Degaussing it could correct the color.
---
Just make a Starter Edition account for free.
---
Even on the highest pop pservers it hasn't been supply driving the price of devilsaurs. A certain % of leathers are never sold. Price-fixing here requires control of every layer though.
---
I can't find statistics on the uk. They probably didn't run the same study yet.
---
Degrees in the US are 4 years. The fact is that most people don't earn a degree in that time. They change majors halfway through or drop out and go back. I'm sure it's the same in the uk as well
---
it helped when the monitors were on a long time. 
---
basically it looked like there was rainbow type discolouration in certain areas on the screen.
---
I poked around last night after seeing this post and it looked sold out just about everywhere.
---
That boss does hit hard...
---
2+ emp runs per day for more than 6 months before I gave up on getting hoj.
---
So ez, pservers got things super wrong when apparently all this time they could have just watched joanas video to get it right?
---
Can't believe there's so many comments in this thread about that. How do so many people not understand what the point of this beta is?
---
Anyone in the beta should be reporting bugs to the forums or using the in game tool. People reporting bugs here should be required to include a Twitch clip or something.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
See: "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?"
---
(You don't need BfA.)
---
In addition to the limited beta, there are going to be three (at least when I looked) stress tests that last like 5 days each, where they are going to let, I would assume, everyone who wants to jump on.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
You can't reduce the server cap once it's there. If a server doesn't die what are you going to do? Split it in half?
---
I'm glad you prefer private servers. Go play those instead. The rest of us want vanilla wow. Not some hacked up version with 20m lotus spawns.
---
Nice. You peaked.
---
TFW no one even mentions grad school is a thing
---
Just wanted to add that if you do contact Blizzard, I'd keep in generic.  "What will I need to buy to start a new WoW: Classic account?"
---
I'm pretty sure sharing accounts is against the TOS and even though it's pretty innocent, you wouldn't want to accidentally get banned by an overzealous blue.
---
1999 : I need 3 other guys to help me move my 20 inch tv.
---
2019 : I can carry a 55 inch TV by myself with ease.
---
I'm normal and I got invited to the beta yesterday. Not a streamer or anything special. I did not play the blizzcon demo. But i created my account day 1 (Nov. 23, 2004) (not collectors edition. mine is normal). I've had an active account since Nov 23, 2004, but have taken 3-4 month unsubbed breaks about 4 times over the years. I have kept an active subscription since mid-Legion. I've been playing BfA super casual until about 4 months ago when i decided to try vanilla wow on a private server, and have been obsessed with that. I've been playing on a private server, but kept my subscription just in case.
---
I very clearly remember playing this game with my dad and bragging to kids in my 3rd/4th grade classes that I was playing WoW while they had shitty Runescape.  
---
If you can't remember anything from 9 years old, maybe you have fried your brain or something idk.
---
I was hoping this would sneak in
---
You only need to pay 15$ and you get everything before BFA and also classic.
---
This has nothing to do with faulty private server data, this is someone who doesn't know how to play the game.
---
So its instances of a zone, but on the same server?
---
Why exactly do you feel the need to defend people who, at best, are just commercials for the game?
---
Streamers, if they have any benefit at all, may bring in new players. However, the way they warp gameplay on their server and the way they soak up beta invites is not beneficial for the common player. If you already plan to play Classic, all streamers do is make certain servers worse.
---
At a base level, streamers are toxic for the people on their server, to the point where a "streamer-free" server is constantly demanded. They simply make the game experience worse, particularly in a community-driven MMO.
---
A Classic WoW where streamers are common across all servers is a worse game. To resist these people and the way Blizzard favors them is all common players can do. They make the game worse, end of story.
---
But they‚Äôre testing stuff based off of wrong pserver values
---
CAN YOU MOONWALK??
---
Why do people always ask this shit in every beta for every MMO ever?   I've never once seen this be the case...and I've been playing MMOs since before WoW existed.
---
I'm sure there's one shitty company with a broken failed MMO that has done it just so some smartass can come in here and "prove me wrong"...but that would be the exception, not the rule....by a HUGE margin.
---
Well tipsout can be fun to watch, thing is that he acts like he have deep knowledge about game mechanics when he actually have mediocre knowledge 
---
This causes a spread of misinformation that can be harmful to the game if people (or hell, even devs!) starts to believe him.
---
If tipsout just stops with these lies and just play as the casual he is, then he will be more fun to watch.
---
Look at asmongold, he sure knows a lot and he tends to get stuff wrong aswell but he is not trying to teach people game mechanics he doesn't know anyghing about. Be more like him, be humble and get viewers.
---
Whole lotta projecting going on here. How you interpreted the top-level content to be a dig at Mythic+ retail content is beyond me. You might be on the wrong subreddit friend.
---
I was 7 when I started playing in 2005 and I just started school back then. I'm 21 now and in uni (also school).
---
Whether you're trying to remember how things worked 15 years ago, or basing it off imperfect private servers, your input as a tester is suspect. 
---
That doesn't mean it's useless, we can report things that SEEM wrong and then Blizzard has the data to verify it.
---
I started as 11 years old in early 2006 and I just finished my 4th year of engineering so it is possible but you'd have had to been very young at launch
---
It allows you to get onto your main faster to kill whoever is ganking your alt!
---
No 4:3 CRT? THAT'S NOT CANNON D:
---
its not the classic community, its the WOW community all the hardstuck raider and players who could never do well in PVP voicing their opinions.
---
They are not paid to play. But they are making money by playing.
---
I played in '04 and I graduated high school in the 90s.
---
If it's still 12k by that point it'll probably split into three slightly too small realms...
---
Yeah same.
---
Banks on banks of benefit time .  Sick time, vacation, company holidays, PTO.  It can add up if any carry over, especially if the most exciting vacation you take is playing a video game.
---
Faulty bug reports come from both private server players and players from vanilla who remember incorrectly. I doubt anyone actually remembers the exact values for x but both groups have an idea of what the value is. Both groups are probably wrong.
---
This thread is just an excuse for OP to hate on private server players, low effort tbh.
---
You‚Äôll pay it all in taxes then ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Is someone forcing you to watch his videos, or why do you know them so well yet dislike them so much?
---
That's pretty lazy blizzard, good god.
---
I took launch week off. My RL friends and I have started a battle.net group for recruiting more players for our guild. (RP guild on alliance PM me for info) I would be focusing on recruiting on live but I got into the Beta so... I‚Äôm going to test out a bunch of stuff and give feed back for a few weeks before returning to BFA till launch... maybe.
---
You realize people can like more than one expansion, right?
---
TBC and MoP are my favorite expansions by a mile.
---
You have no idea if it is going to work that way. So stop acting like you know and everyone else is wrong. Their complaints are justified and important if we want to avoid these potentially very bad outcomes.
---
He makes youtube videos and often outsources his information. He's like an intro to WoW guy. I don't even like him that much but the hate he gets is unbelievable.
---
Does that take into account racial weapon skill? That's a huge boost to damage especially on higher level mobs.
---
I got access as well and never received an email until hours after I was given access.   I just happened to see someone post that they saw the Classic PTR in their launcher, I checked my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account and sure enough I had access as well.  As I said though, about 3 hours later an email appeared in my inbox.
---
No. Watch the streams, they are not. They are checking what is wrong on private servers and reporting mechanical issues they find that are obvious bugs.
---
Unless we have hard numbers to compare to (hint: we don't really, the best we have is archived footage of vanilla from people like Joana) the best anyone can do is 'vague'. The idea is to point Blizzard in the direction we think differences exist so they can do a code comparison and see if there is an inconsistency.
---
This.  Plus the toggleable options.
---
What exactly do you disagree with ?
---
Yeah, it's some weird shit. Some guy is saying it doesn't count that I played at 9? Like wtf?
---
Even with access to the original code and data, differences in implementation and the underlying engine can still cause bugs.
---
Having said that, anyone using private servers as "proof" that something like health or mana regen are wrong needs to slow their roll and try to find actual evidence contemporary to Vanilla, like an old video or forum post or spreadsheet or screenshot, as private servers are much more likely to have it wrong than Blizzard.
---
It was definitely a good thing to report it, but IIRC they went to the reference 1.12 client and observed that the 'lock summoning this was working as it had in Vanilla and it was people's memories (whether due to the fog of age or pserver differences) that were off in that case.
---
Isn‚Äôt this misleading? Picking Tauren doesn‚Äôt mean you will be able to do this unless you‚Äôre attacking s other Tauren right?
---
Welcome to the WoW community where nobody wants to contribute; they just want to be angry. Enjoying your stay so far?
---
It activated a metal wire that wrapped around the inside of your monitor which would neutralize magnetism, correcting color issues caused by magnetic fields. So basically, if your screen was looking weird across multiple programs you should degauss it. If the monitor didn't have the built-in feature, you would have to get a circular "wand" that you would wave in a circular motion in front of the screen. 
---
Using the feature \*too\* much could also damage your monitor though.
---
What's your darnassus rep at? It may not be saying anything in the combat log, but you may still be getting some.
---
it's ok... to not like things...
---
I got my email about 3 hours after I had access (saw a post about PTR access in the launcher and on battle net) checked and I had access as well.   Email came way after.
---
I remember that boss. Hit like a truck
---
It's more of a fact than a suggestion.
---
Staysafe is going to 30 and then mass reporting bugs all at once. Atm he can barely read more than a sentence in his chat because he's so tired after 20+ hours streaming. He's definitely going to report those bugs isn't he lmao.
---
Because it's not real vanilla if my character list doesn't randomly shuffle causing me to log in to the wrong char for months :/
---
buddy, just install a quality adblocker and you will never even think about youtube ads ever again.
---
i played WoW when i was 5 lol so its possible
---
this has nothing to do for private servers, the tank was just being stupid
---
Pserver players:
---
Actually reported a ton useful bugs which are true, **BUT** mistake with demon summon mechanic
---
Retail redditor pepega:
---
Checked if male nelf priest animation are good enough ir he should roll a female one.
---
That actually effects gameplay.
---
Yeah, I agree. Seeing players I would have assumed to be experts getting facerolled by this game makes me happy. But then turning around and reporting it as a bug displays a lack of maturity. That's why I asked incredulously if it was true.
---
Ok I'm sorry, he was in 4th or 5th grade smh....
---
Yeah Blizz was just playing it safe. If I were them I'd honestly start just letting more waves in and make the server bumping.
---
No they should definitely only think of literally half the summer as true summer.
---
It's just a joke thread. It's kind of human nature to call people out on obvious lies.
---
IIRC Health and mana actually ticked every 2 seconds but were measured on stats and character sheets in increments of 5 seconds (hp5 and mp5).
---
The API is not the same. It's a modified version of the modern client.
---
This is possible I believe, since his participation in tests may have a value, like rare hardware spec.
---
 I'm out of school, but army + bachelors took a little bit of extra time than just a bachelors
---
I'm 33 and I feel mega old around here. How on earth did people find the time to play wow when they were under 15?
---
Just because Blizzard has access to the original 1.12 client doesn't mean they ported everything over correctly to the Classic client, which is based off BFA. 
---
Weapon misses are something that was drastically nerfed over the expansions so it would not be surprising if they're using the wrong numbers.
---
So this is a dungeon group I do not want to be in. Check.
---
I'm not OP, but I got access as well.  I'm not a streamer or have a youtube channel, not a creator of any sort.   I was Day 2 subscriber and have ever expansion, had many gaps in my subscription when I got bored of the game.   I have been subbed to BFA for the last 8 months and have it paid up until September, however I haven't played it since January.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Yeah, that's what I remember too. While they did make ticks smoother later on in WoW's life, they weren't staggered across 5 seconds for sure beforehand.
---
And this is different from WoW... how?
---
Oh, yeah, they don‚Äôt overpull, wipe, and disband in FFXIV.
---
hey, my opinion as a 5-year old should be respected since i obviously have great taste, also check these fortnite dances and did you see what jamie did on instagram? omg lol ecks deeeeeeeeeeeee
---
See, this is why I don't mind if Blizzard doesn't listen to these self-proclaimed experts.
---
I went back to school recently, won't be done for a few more years. I'm 27, definitely played vanilla wow before. We exist :)
---
It doesn‚Äôt. They guy was talking out of his ass.
---
I was speaking in general about phases/mechanics, nothing in MC can compare to modern mythic raiding and to even compare ‚Äúmultiple add management.‚Äù Or think rotations are at all similar is just simply asinine. 
---
Vanilla was amazing, and it‚Äôs tons of fun. But the fun came from managing and overcoming roster/computer issues and at the time lack of information on mechanics(deep breath theories anyone?) but from my perspective(raider since 2004 top 10-500 guilds every tier since expect MOP.) the fights and classes are much more complex and fun to play now in raids than in vanilla. Having to time CDs, cleave etc. just simply didn‚Äôt exist to the extent it does now.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs brainless, but it‚Äôs simple not as competitively challenging as modern raids and that‚Äôs ok. The challenge comes from leveling and earlier more casual content.
---
I feel like beta tests shouldn't be highly promoted. Showing off bugs might have worked for PUBG but Im not a big fan. Betas should be for testing, not entertainment.
---
Just my opinion
---
Well yea, wolves in Elwynn at lvl 1 do like 1-3 ticks of damage as they're supposed to.
---
Do they play private servers? How can you be a good vanilla streamer without access to vanilla?
---
Downvote and move on. Nothing to see here.
---
It's not too low, it's correct.
---
It can get hard. Some areas don‚Äôt always offer easy pulls.
---
That's based on the old scrubbed databases that private servers use. This means it won't be fully accurate for classic.
---
No one will be fully accurate for classic until we can get a read on the live database and API. Hopefully that'll happen soon with the beta launch.
---
Is the game ~8gb only?
---
Yeah, sophomore year of HS in '05. Now in 3rd year of PhD. Worked a couple years in between undergrad and grad.
---
Release date is brutal
---
Your 14 year old memories are not a source.
---
more like walletsout
---
7-9 year olds playing WoW... Now suddenly a lot of really bad dungeon runs make sense in my head.
---
Notch seems pretty miserable
---
They did.
---
or type /reload
---
lets be honest we're all replacing that gear real soon anyway
---
No, there are a significant number of people who play warrior/rogue/hunter and think they should roll on spirit gear because it helps with leveling.
---
with a reply that fast i see someone who's salty they didnt get beta LMAOLULOL
---
All of Reddit downvotes with the fickleness and determination of a small child, so I would say this is normal lol
---
Yet some random youtuber who started in cata and has only ever played private servers gets in over someone like me who has tested literally every beta including vanilla and reported hundreds of bugs maybe thousands... Guess I should have started a youtube clickbait channel too.
---
True but he has your typical slightly above average gamer pc. Nothing that I would consider unique/rare or an extremity. He's gotten a lot of beta invites from blizzard, we think he somehow got on a special F&amp;F type of list.
---
100% marketing for streamers to show off a smooth leveling experience. Don't want zones clustered making it impossible to quest and forced to stand around waiting for everything. On the bright side, some guildmates just got an invite this morning so more are being pumped out.
---
I try to min/max to a point.  Not a true min max simply because I will most likely always be behind the leaders in terms of gearing.  I do try to do the best with what I have,  but probably won‚Äôt be so picky as to play say, an SM/ruin warlock and flip flop the few pve oriented talents to the pvp ones every week.  
---
I try to think of bis as dynamic and based on the highest content I actually have access to.  I will often pick something more fun or quality of life based vs 100% optimal character.
---
yeah, they will do the same thing after having negotiated supply/prices with the dominant mafia
---
unless they want to be corpse camped for the next week
---
cartels are an ancient invention, world didn't start with your birth, dude
---
&gt;This will POSITIVELY impact you whenever classic comes out because we know that a huge community is a big part of why classic was so fun and successful.
---
The community that comes with immature children like Sodapoppin and relentless poopsockers like Asmongold is a significant downgrade when compared to the non-streamer ecosystem of the actual 2004-2006 WoW. Even if streamers make positive promotional content for Classic, their existence in-game is a definite negative factor. They can single-handedly wreck faction balance and World PvP by the force of their fanbase infesting the server.
---
All that needs to be done is to have some form of streaming prohibition on a single server, to separate those who want an experience closer to the original WoW from those who like to see people scream live on Twitch.
---
I don't care much about the streamers getting Beta preference, but there needs to be pushback to these people in a general sense, as they present a serious risk of ruining the Classic experience for common players.
---
"I totally remember Vanilla haha, good times. Wait, August release date??? My high school starts BEFORE THAT THOUGH!!!!"
---
The tank's chest piece was broken, too.  
---
Afterwards they tried to claim it was bugged.  Was pretty funny.
---
I was a day one player and did not receive and invite, for the record.  I was subbed solidly Vanilla through Cata, briefly in MoP, and then re-upped to play BfA last fall.  Active account.
---
But it's not a big deal to me.  Only a beta.  If I get it, I'll do my part to spot bugs, and have some fun playing something I'm not going to play when classic releases but if not, my hype will not be dimmed!
---
Nice. Grats :)
---
It's one of the best stat for melee during levelling  Because it reduces the downtime between pulls. Best thing would be to have a spirit gear set to use it out of combat and agi/STR during combat. But because of limited bag slots I will prefer spirit.
---
I don't think it's pointless at all. I'm not in the beta, and I'm enjoying the discussion.
---
Who the fuck wants to play and burn out on a broken version of Classic? Retards..
---
Because the majority(not all) of people do.
---
I am curious, did you have the collector's edition fir vanilla or just the regular box?
---
Uhm ... I would guess he just needed it because beta and they think who cares there?
---
I mean, Spirit is not completly garbage as warrior leveling. But you Need tons of it to be real usefull. Prolly better to just stick with some Food and bandages and go full str/agi.
---
Im feared though a bit ... when classic goes live, many many People from BFA will come and will just take gear because "its higher/blue".
---
No, you have to say over.... over.
---
im surprised how few people got in
---
of the content i watched 2 - 3 people per zone seems to be about the max
---
I doubt there is 1k players on the servers ive seen
---
i guess needing to have an active sub and opt in does reduce the pool of people they could invite a lot; it is common for bliz to trickle out invites tho , its prob just marketing bs
---
Looks promising, and it seems they're using the old particle effects for the rain. But I really hope there's more variety in the weather instead of just light rain.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcJyercsiVQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcJyercsiVQ)
---
The biggest slap in the face is needing an active sub to 'test' it for them
---
people may or may not be able to move between layers by joining groups and such, maybe. It's not entirely clear.
---
You forgot the one who actually matters before all of those: Joana.
---
*First, color blind more. Second, character rearrangement. Calling it now, third is LFR/LFG/Warchief Sylvanas/Level boosts/WoW tokens/Artifacts/Free Legendaries/AP farming, REEEEE*
---
Not a bug relatera question but IM really curious. How big is the game ? Ive seen screenshots of 8gb but i dont know IF thats correct?
---
I like it
---
Yea, but it's the best stat for mana users because not only does it reduce downtime between pulls by providing HP regen, but it also gives mana regen. It's literally twice as good for anyone with mana because of that fact alone.
---
Maybe I should roll mage and use AGI gear to swap to whenever the mob gets in melee range. It gives better dodge.
---
Garbage go home
---
I totally clicked spells in Vanilla! I‚Äôd heard about people binding keys, but I was like ‚Äúmeh, I enjoy it how it is‚Äù and continued to happily be an average player
---
I was eight when it came out. I‚Äôm a senior in college right now. 
---
That‚Äôs how that works.
---
Waah I didn't get an invite on the first day waah
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgV6Gk7LfK4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zANeJ_lCSXc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=52
---
Looks correct
---
Any numbers, real comparison or evidence?
---
I agree that someone like you should get an invite. Blizzard should be able to see metrics like your and invite those people who would actually benefit the game. On the other hand, Blizzard also knows that giving big streamers access will generate hype for the game. Its a business decision plain and simple...they know these streamers wont actually submit tickets.
---
The work is done - it‚Äôs called the live realms. Both are running on the same engine/client. They could probly import the updates textures and models into classic?
---
Soda helped you retards to get wow classic in the first place
---
Spirit IS good for non mana users. However, it's BETTER for mana users.
---
In my experience invites are either constantly trickling out or released in waves, targeting whoever they think will be suitable to test whatever content they want tested this week.
---
"I think" "I believe" "remember them to be" are not proof and most certainly not justification for anything.
---
In '04 I was just starting my 2nd (of what ended up being 3) try of college. I didnt get a degree until '17.
---
probably be a way to game the system, all it takes is someone on a diff layer inviting people to it for gold. what happens when u leave that group do you stay until you join another group? easy abuse
---
Because some pserver content creators have made videos explaining how "spirit is BiS for melee classes while leveling!" and stuff like that, so now some few individuals think their warrior needs all the spirit they can get.
---
I just did this kind of math the other day. I figured if wow vanilla ended in 2006 and the average youngest regular players were about 10 then by that logic there really wasn‚Äôt anyone younger than 22-23 now that played vanilla. vanilla was definitely an era of gaming.
---
The private servers were off.
---
Blizzard, bleazze send invite!
---
I started playing WoW in April of 2005 when I was a young teacher. Now I'm a seasoned teacher that still plays WoW (off and on) and I'm looking forward to getting to play the original game (or as close to the original as Blizzard can produce) just for old times sake.
---
Being a teacher, I fell like I've been in school all my life.
---
I mean, it might offer a minor advantage to leveling; but then again so does an enchanter mage rolling on blue plate cause it gives regeants.
---
Hell. At 40 you need 90g for a mount. Need everything to sell it to the vendor
---
Avoid these people. They clearly are have no sense of reason.
---
you are not the only one
---
ReEeEeEeEeEeEe
---
Okay, so um. Do you want us to yell at these unknown secret people you talk about? Do you want us to apologize about the jews as well? I mean, are you trying to blame someone or just lashing out? This "Significant" number you're talking about is pretty much like this post.. Not really significant.
---
Spirit also increases health regen, which is extremely useful for leveling a warrior. Also, it is not a static increase with the spirit you have, it increases exponentially. The more spirit that warriors have the much greater regen they can accomplish
---
sounds like a retail player to me
---
I mean, you‚Äôre acting like the ability to request to join a group takes all that away completely?
---
Most people aren‚Äôt going to just randomly inv people and will message to see what they want.
---
If anything, it will likely remove the words ‚Äúhey, can I join your group‚Äù out of the equation, and that‚Äôs about it.  I personally feel like you‚Äôre being a bit over-dramatic about the ‚Äúissues‚Äù it could pose.
---
&gt;Im feared though a bit ... when classic goes live, many many People from BFA will come and will just take gear because "its higher/blue".
---
I'm wondering about this myself, It's been quite a few years since i played vanilla/classic (I quit during TBC) but i don't remember anyone except mana users ever rolling on spirit gear
---
&gt;I can understand why some people do care. To most it's not a big deal but some people want to literally feel like they're back in 2004 playing vanilla wow and all these small changes to UI are easily noticeable to most vets and ruins that feel.
---
So don't change the order
---
Another problem with memories is that people didn't just play vanilla, they played TBC too. You can remember things from that time period but not easily which patch it was and whether it was even vanilla instead of TBC. The summoning behavior was like that in TBC iirc and without the reference it would be impossible to know without video.
---
Yet accurate all the same
---
That all different servers merged later means that until the merge you are always the same group of people per server. AFAIK which layer you are on is chosen every time you log in and then stays the same only until you log out. The next day you might be playing with/against different people.
---
Guess you conventiently missed the part of my post history where I mentioned I'm a direct-entry PhD student at a globally top-ranked university (and within my 1st year invited to present my research at an international meeting). I don't mean to get into a dick measuring contest but you're talking to the wrong person.
---
I'm 22 and I can most certainly remember many many memories of playing wow when I was 8...
---
Found the Blizzard employee.
---
&gt; I remember a lot of bits and pieces
---
I think that's the point. I remember all of the games I've played - I was playing Everquest at 8/9, and I played World of Warcraft at 14 (both at around launch). 
---
There are definitely things I remember happening, but I can absolutely guarantee you that no one (or at least, as many people as claim to) at age 8/9 remembers all of the things they claim to remember, or really comprehending the significance of what they were doing. A lot of it is probably their memory being influenced by what they've read over time.
---
Obviously, I don't think the person you're replying to means "you can't remember anything that young", but just that... all of the people recalling the exact way everything was at that point in time, including grand experiences and complex mechanics, probably aren't recalling due to what they experienced directly. It's just shit people say, because they experienced it 2nd or 3rd hand, and who is really going to be able to dispute it?
---
I think that's why he is disputing (not just you) most people remembering things of significance and complexity from the age of 9, 15 years later. Not everyone has the same memory, of course, so it is a bit careless to cast such a wide blanket.
---
Same, but replace Cata with TBC.
---
Hey, just because the vocal minority streamers get access doesn‚Äôt mean non vocal players didn‚Äôt get them too. I‚Äôm in the beta, been playing WoW since original vanilla beta, love classic and have been providing feedback. A lot of other players in the beta atm I spoke with are the same. So don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not just the loud ones in there.
---
Chestpiece and belt were busted, Soda was DPSing. A lot of stupid issues here that's a direct result of laziness.  We've been trained to be lazy with Retail WoW and this clip is a perfect example of it.
---
I mean I played WoW with a track pad at one point
---
HAhahahahahhahahahahahahaha, if you pay actual gold to go to a different layer you've got something wrong with you. Stop saying easy abuse when you don't actually know what happens. You're assuming the absolute worst with zero information. Stop trying to create outrage.
---
You should probably add that he reported the boss for doing too much damage, I always thought it was a meme, but the guy's a fucking joke.
---
‚Ä¢ Alexensual
---
Well original point was to start a discussion.
---
I don't understand the streamer thing. I would rather play a game than watch someone else do it. However, I think there is some economy to hundreds of people watching one person playing and picking apart/suggesting things to try. I hate to give streamers any cred, but this might be a pretty good way to amplify any potential issues, lots of people will see them doing things and then the nerds that we are, will do the research to figure out if there's real vanilla evidence of how it should be. Yeah, the streamers are not filing bugs, but they are exposing a lot of people to game play for analysis.
---
wow gatekeepers are so fucking lame lol
---
&gt; Your 14 year old memories are not a source.
---
Please sticky this to the top of this thread mods.
---
I‚Äôm in same boat - I got all excited until I noticed it was sold out.
---
This sub is so easily triggered. Just proves the truth behind OPs post, a lot of the members are kids.
---
The game is not hard.
---
Those streamers are terrible players, that's why they are dying this much.
---
Just the regular box.
---
Searching on my own I found this but I'd love to see more resources https://rankedboost.com/world-of-warcraft/classic-best-class-tier-list/
---
Ooo that's good that's good
---
Are you kidding me dude? Ofc this happens in 14 as well. 14 isn't some magical bastion that has no flaws and is the anti-wow like some people think. There's shit players in all mmos, 14 included.
---
Yeah definitely.. People were saying that blizz had video proof of the bugs implemented, but I didn't see any proof of that. Would be nice if they made a blue post about it or something.
---
Ahh, this my man. This is impressive editing. Bravo.
---
Well, I'm at work right now, so browsing Reddit instead of playing... but I have a Day 1 account that, other than a few extended hiatuses for military deployment and school, played actively from beta 2004-2011. I'm not a streamer, content creator, or F&amp;F. I haven't been subbed since 2011. I paid for a month Tuesday night and got in on the first wave.
---
That's how it was you moron lol
---
OK
---
At least they fucking report bugs.
---
It's also because it's a vocal minority, everyone who played in vanilla will say they played in vanilla but you rarely see people saying they didnt play in vanilla
---
Its a new way to just test mmo games, small closed for the marketing and in the full release full of bugs and exploits.
---
Then we will be brothers in Azeroth!!
---
Weapon misses were always rarer at super early levels. Even getting to 10 or so I've seen misses and dodges increasing.
---
Lol Horde peasant xD
---
So, no cats allowed on laiers or what?
---
You're really just retarded, arent you?
---
They did the same test Tauren vs Orc and the Orc was able to hit the Tauren at those distances and Vice versa. I‚Äôm pretty sure Tauren have larger hit boxes and larger melee swing distances
---
if it's official employment, then you get paid for 135 per month cause you do a month's job. If you don't work cause you have an official sick leave then it's 80% for the days you missed (but that's only for a limited time you can't ride that train indefinitely. If you don't work cause ... you needed to take the day off, then you get paid normal amount if you use your annual LoA days, if not (and if somehow even agrees for u to take an unpayed day off lol) then u get nada.
---
&gt;  thousands of bugs reported by people that only have pserver experience 
---
I think that's an optimistic estimate.i  I feel like, as demonstrated in this very thread, there's gonna be an ungodly high amount of bugs reported based on pserv experience and hazy, incorrect 14 year old memories from people that were literally children back then.   I honestly feel sorry for whoever has to go through and sort that crap.
---
People can suggest that there MAY be bugs, and Blizzard will confirm or deny it. That's the point of beta testing. 
---
Also, the database is not the game. They are using the BFA client, which at it's core no doubt works completely differently. They can't just cut and paste 1.12 numbers onto it and expect it to work perfectly. Hence, beta testing.
---
Thanks man. I really needed to hear this rn.
---
Almost all good MBA programs require multiple years (3+) of work experience to be admitted, and having 10+ years is desirable. My friend didn't finish hers until she was 40.
---
Both are viable, frost is a bit easier since you are keeping mobs frozen/slowed, and the damage ramps up well with Shatter. But fire is a bit more fun than frostbolting.
---
Also don't sweat AoE frost leveling, it's unrealistic to expect those areas to be empty right after release, and even a little mob competition makes it not worth it.
---
no but it can make you a shadow priest
---
Get some dude.
---
Well you are wrong on the first point, but everything else checks out :D
---
&gt;In the end the Classic team might end up with more work cause of the Beta
---
Isn't this, like, the whole point of having a beta in the first place?
---
if i can tell you one thing about vanilla is yeah there will be loot drama over almost any drop
---
warlocks rolling on blue strength swords , hunters rolling on litterally anything that deops 
---
its part of the game
---
So I started playing obsessively during patch 1.10 on a pvp server. 
---
I was ganked so many times by opposing ?? level warlocks that I once had a dream that I myself was standing alone in Tanaris looking out over the desert, when what do I see on the horizon but a lovely ?? undead warlock coming right at me. I tried desparately to run away, but there was no running away from this warlock on his Dreadsteed. The warlock got closer and closer. First he cast Fear and I couldn't help but run in circles while he tortured my soul, until finally I awoke from my nightmare in a cold sweat.
---
and everyone clapped
---
Yes but the information it was legion is 6 months old, it's evident it hasn't been accurate for months.  The proof of it only appeared a month ago but the information you are spreading is old and wrong.
---
Yeah, you're right they are just releasing game breaking bugs like this without even having a beta...  What a sham.
---
Ok
---
That's a big reach, are you okay?
---
How ironic that the first official Classic server (excluding blizzcon demo) is a... private server.
---
Same, one of those red pimples was the worst
---
im min maxing bro. layer 2 got that fresh black lotus and less farmers on it, id pay for that
---
Obviously, the stress tests will have a ton more invites.
---
And I believe they also stated that invites will be rolling out as they need them.  There will be a lot more people with invites on August 1 than June 1 as they get closer to launch.
---
you can toggle that. You can pretty much toggle all the graphics to look much more like vanilla.
---
No money? No funny bunny honey! Lol.
---
You're likely wrong though. My brother was unsubbed when he received a beta invite.
---
Relax, it's just a game. While you may not care about bugs, the unwashed masses will. Blizzard wants a smooth release because that will yield better press and ultimately make them more money.
---
You could also be very creative and mix "Bubble" into your paladin name.
---
because they're spammed 30 times a day on this subreddit
---
Nobody can PROVE it's a bug because nobody can log into Vanilla lol. What do you expect? The point is to tell Blizzard what LOOKS wrong so they can check it.
---
There was a similar blog to this one, but went up to WotLK I think. Does anyone remember/can link something like that? Thanks.
---
The game is running on the modern game client so I think they included some minor graphical improvements
---
I‚Äôm in college if that counts. 28 and just got my AA last semester. Start my bachelors program in September
---
Entitled kids.
---
Rekt
---
Same, but don't replace anything
---
Right, unrelated but does anyone actually use UML to plan out software? I was taught it and have never, ever, seen it used in production environment.
---
I absolutely love the talent trees. They're not perfect but especially while lvling you get a small sense of reward everytime you have a new point available.
---
I remember I printed that bitch out.
---
I was a very wasteful 14 year old.
---
I got to level 50 by the time Cats started then deleted the character.
---
Ooh la la. Look at Mr. Fancy pants with his career all figured out here!
---
(Naw legit stoked for you OP. Just finished the first year of my Master‚Äôs degree in community health sciences here).
---
I played in 2004, I'm enjoying beta. It's a lot of fun. 
---
And the regen feels right. I've never played on a Pserver.
---
Except you are not lol
---
a true warlock deletes his character till he gets a good imp name
---
There's literally 0 point to your argument. You're just another entitled kid
---
Not going to lie, this is me. Hated my life, was so damn confused trying to discover myself. I played WoW to escape reality and lived my life in that world that made me feel a hero to many people, especially if you played in an RP server. I looked at my character like it was me, a person I desire to become. My WoW Character was more appealing that the person I would see in the mirror in reality.
---
My priority, passion was being in WOW. Made me neglect everything in my life, family, friends, and school. As I got older, I realized there are more important things in life. 
---
I finished school late. It is not WoWs fault and it is not a mistake. Everything happens for a reason. I would not be the person I am today if it was not for WoW.
---
Quest givers in the starting zones don't have the faction icon on their unit frame and are not marked as PvP.
---
classic - https://youtu.be/fTnFuUUXHYk?t=1440
---
vanilla - https://youtu.be/SwLjJH8LXfc?t=93
---
Spirit is primarily a mana user stat because as you said it's more beneficial to them.
---
Some melee class players use a spirit set when they are out of combat  to regen HP faster but that's it.
---
If a spirit gear drop, mana user should always have priority on it, especially healer, and if no mana user need it then melee can roll on it for their HP regen set.
---
I think they‚Äôre banking on a majority of the player base not being autistic enough to coordinate layers to their advantage. And they‚Äôre probably right - not everyone is going to be in a hc guild that‚Äôs big enough to work things out. And they probably also know that the hardcore players are going to try and abuse it but it‚Äôs a necessary evil to keep the servers going down at launch. 
---
It‚Äôs almost as if, crazy, I know, some decisions have pros and cons.
---
I don't think all assets are updated which would be needed for Classic?
---
There is also the problem of actually using them. The old assets and old code is intricately linked. They had to work a lot to make it work.
---
Well, I'm not Blizzard but from what I gathered they specifically worked on recreating Vanilla and I don't think they'd revisit the project. If anything they'll work on the expansions next.
---
Done.
---
Because I bet nobody in this thread can find a clip of him saying something like
---
"Man classic is going to fucking suck, why are they wasting time on it instead of retail". 
---
etc.
---
Its not early access its beta and i think its as much about them being experie ced vanilla players as it is about them being streamers. I would not get beta even if i stream and thats because i play only since wotlk.
---
These are the people giving advice to everyone for over a year?
---
I understand your concern but I think you are serverly overerstimating the popularity of classic after 4 weeks of launch.
---
I am by no means a person whos saying the game will be dead but 95% of the streamers that are not "wow-streamers" (that would be your lirik/timthetatman/ninja etc) will have quit the game.
---
The only big streamers that will stay are sodapoppin and asmongold. They have said that they will most likely play on the same server and are split because soda is playing horde and asmongold alliance. So even this server should be relatively balanced in terms of faction stuff.

I expect classic to release with more than a few servers to choose from so you can avoid all of your problems by not joining the server soda/asmongold are playing on.
---
well if he has one chance at building a career on twitch and yt it is now.
---
You people doom &amp; gloom more than MMO Champ Christ.
---
You didn‚Äôt address my other points . And are there any studies ? Do you know of any tf2 players that became gambling addicts ? 
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre similar at all. There‚Äôs no monetary gain with loot boxes , and there‚Äôs no real jackpots to overwatch crates the same way there are in Vegas slot machines .
---
But also larger hitbox
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
I think the difference is that for a warrior, Spirit is actually THE best stat in terms of how it helps the person level. Mana users generally go for intellect when levelling as that increases total mana pool. That being said, I wouldn't roll over a caster for spirit, min-maxing whilst levelling is a bit too much for my liking.
---
I clicked this with full knowledge that it‚Äôll be stuck in my head for the rest of the day
---
Good point, didn't think of that!  Only 6 letters left.  3 if you also use "din"
---
But after that says "screw it" so they don't have to level up again.
---
Did you sneak into Blizzard to get these insider sliders?
---
This is gold!
---
The demon summon mechanics was like that in expansions, someone not playing on pservers could easily falsely remember TBC mechanic and attribute it to vanilla because they were periods close together long time ago.
---
Sharing and layering are different. Sharing in combining multiple realms because of low population. Layering is splitting up one server into layers because of too many players.
---
True but feral (I've heard) is a ton of work to get mediocre dps with compared to rogues and warriors that don't really have to try that hard to achieve middleground dps. Plus feral in TBC is a whole other beast.
---
This is the format all top level comments in this thread should be in.
---
So... what‚Äôs the bug
---
I'm not crying this time...
---
No, I'm not crying this time...
---
üò≠
---
There were still plenty of night elf hunters named xxDarkLegolasxx
---
And as for this argument - play ONLY with friends and guildies so that you can loot council your wailing caverns groups - until then you‚Äôre forced to roll with people who balance their need/greed options differently than you.
---
With one hand too lmao, at least when it's in the new packaging with the handle.
---
They aren't every thread is y'all fucking crying about streamers like a wounded animal
---
I never said majority of playerbase would do it. It's completely irrelevant. Cheats, botting and exploits are bad for the game regardless if it's done by minority or majority.
---
How about you create your own dungeon group with those rules then? Determine your own rules, stop determining the rules for others.
---
There is no satyr‚Äòs bow in p1....
---
Yeah I'm really surprised at how few people seem to be in there. I imagine they wanted to start really small and will probably ramp things up, it's not going to be good for testing or marketing if it's just a handful of streamers running around in a dead world. 
---
Seems like most of the 'normal' invites that went out yesterday were for day 1 players, so it makes me think they will continue to prioritize vanilla players, maybe inviting month 2/3 players next and so on.
---
I don't think this beta will ever be as big as a typical blizzard beta though, since they aren't interested in gameplay feedback.
---
The worst is when you get a really cute imp name and get super attatched and then your blueberry‚Äôs name is horrendous
---
I played it as a toddler in 2004-5 when my brother played. I still remember a fair amount of stuff from it, mostly just thinkin how cool the forsaken were.
---
they only sent out 1 wave of invites so far. pretty sure a ton more people are going to get invited over the next few months
---
I want you to do this for me. You are all over every thread having a pathetic meltdown over this yet not doing any legwork to back up your assertion. 
---
Give me a link to two clips. I want the same class, level, race. I want it to be verified footage from 1.12.
---
The only "proof" I've seen of mana regen being busted is some wetbrain posting a video of a human warlock having different regen than a tauren druid. 
---
You are making claims that something is obvious. Do the work to prove it.
---
Well that does not put a smile on my face :( so as a late TBC i probably have lower chances.
---
This is something I can actually relate to pretty well lol, back when 1.12.1 Private Servers were actually becoming a thing, around 2008/2009 or so, there was definitely a stigma attached to not having played Vanilla. It was a super weird form of elitism that eventually turned into the more hardcore, 100% min-maxed optional raid set up types you see on here today.
---
If I remember correctly, I told everyone I made it to Sapphiron before my guild fell apart in the wake of BC‚Äôs on coming release, and that was my identity on various Private Servers for a long time. Now it‚Äôs far more accepted to come out and say that, yes, I did start in Vanilla, 1.10 to be exact, but I didn‚Äôt raid until WotLK. 
---
Classic WoW represents a chance for everyone who wants to to start over and be a part of something ‚Äúnew‚Äù while it is also something familiar. It‚Äôs really amazing what we‚Äôve managed to convince Blizzard to do here honestly.
---
Alexensual currently shaking
---
You know what guys, but transmog feels as "devaluing" gear stuff only because of split-difficulties and expansions. What I mean is, you'd still had to earn the shit you want to transmog and since there are only one version of high-ranking items (as opposed to LFR/Normal/Heroic on live which are the same, but with different tints), it'd make no difference at all. And there'd be no "cool" and "hard to get" items from bygone eras of WoW that became easy to obtain, due to no expansions.
---
i started playing UO when I was 10. Though only because my older brother played it.
---
I went to college at 25, graduated at 30. Just how life goes sometimes.
---
You see this a *lot* with MMOs though.
---
I've seen people that have played nothing but WoW for the past 12 years of their life and still proclaim that every other game (single and multiplayer) is inferior. It blows my mind how people can be so delusional and ignorant.
---
(I'm not talking about/defending 14, just some MMO communities.)
---
Well, the uniqueness surrounding this beta is that Friends &amp; Family haven‚Äôt been invited. Traditionally FF is invited alongside content producers and media. This time, it appears only influencers have been invited.
---
You can get imp at level 1.
---
Maybe the beta is an older build than the client they were playing with at Irvine, I have no idea. But from watching beta, regen rates are nuts.
---
I have PTR access what is it supposed to look like in the launcher?
---
I see no video
---
If I remember at 4 levels miss rate should be around 1/3
---
I imagine everyone here looks like dwight shcrute
---
It's not bad by any means but shouldn't it be more intense?
---
Yeah I've just been watching. Seems off, probably bugged since they tested it.
---
For it to not be a fallacy you'll have to demonstrate the mechanism by which Event A will lead to Event Z. Just saying "slippery slope argument" is an invocation of the fallacy by definition, cause you haven't demonstrated that such a mechanism exists.
---
I mean, we already have a post about someone complaining "rare mobs are way too easy to kill" - like a rare mob should be harder than any other mob.
---
He was 522/563 hp when he pulled, so...
---
what?
---
Vertical content done OSRS style could be amazing
---
&gt;Where can I find the best guides
---
On google.
---
That's good to know.
---
If they don't allow each layer to have it's own resources, the economy is going to be insane with only the most hard core players will be able to afford anything at all.
---
You are arguing that 9k players should share the resources designed to support 3k players. 
---
If you just look at the issue from the other side, it becomes clear how obviously destructive it would be with a server that has a massive supply deficit because the resources for 3k players have to support 9k players.
---
It‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve always received the FnF invite and I do not have access to the beta yet.
---
Same thing

Better than not testing at all. Blizzard has a reference client.
---
High salt on ur part
---
after nax has been out for a long time they should open a BC server and let people migrate characters to it
---
id start from scratch on there just so i could play either endgame
---
As a Hunter, keep your damn hands off Blackcrow.
---
Blizzards announcement of Classic and this post both brought me to tears. May your brother rest in peace. I will text my small brother right now and say thanks.
---
Just fyi, that boss should actually hit that hard, it's actually quite funny
---
His damage values are documented in the official bestiary guide published by blizzard
---
I subscribed but I cannot download.  How do?
---
More like because no one wants to dig through his garbage twitch to find something everyone on here knows he‚Äôs been preaching for the last 2 years.  He would say it. All. The. Time.  People would then call him out on it and be like ‚ÄúWELL IT CUZ PEOPLE COME IN HERE TRASH TALKIN MY RETAIL SO IM JUST LETTIN THEM KNOW THEIR GAME IS TRASH‚Äù
---
Like I said I don‚Äôt need to prove a fucking thing to you and if you want to stay ignorant that is no skin off my back.  Everyone here has heard it and everyone here knows.  The only people defending him are his fans and people who don‚Äôt know any better.
---
Only one per realm.
---
Yep
---
I don't get how people like Lirik, Shortyguy got in.\*
---
&gt; To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we‚Äôll be choosing dedicated players  
---
How the hell are they considered dedicated players? They're variety streamers. No way they're dedicating time to actually beta testing the game and reporting bugs. 
---
\*I mean, I do get it. Blizz gotta sell out to their investors.
---
So do dwarves basically not have a deadzone? Lol.
---
Or you hit the lottery even up to the succubus, but then your felhunter...
---
&gt; You are all over every thread having a pathetic meltdown over this
---
Hahaha, a meltdown? Come on friend.
---
I can't be bothered to do the work, it's obvious enough that someone will, though. Feel free to remember this comment when the proof is on the front page.
---
I don't understand why you're so angry, blizzard gets things wrong all the time, with classic specifically they have shown they are error prone multiple times.
---
no source then
---
You're not arguing that people didnt go nuts with toxicity...you're arguing that's its justified
---
Actually it‚Äôs German for ‚Äúthe gas.‚Äù
---
De gauss! Der ist gauss in de computerviewerein.
---
Maybe I'm blind but I literally haven't seen a single person complaining about graphics?
---
Note the other comments in here.  
---
I don't have facts but a general consensus is that you need Warcraft also selected and an active subscription.  Not mentioned here but having played in actual vanilla, an account started in 2005 or so, will give you a better chance as well.
---
If you ask me, blizzard has intelligent engineers and selecting the beta you want is enough to give you a chance.  Whether having Warcraft selected is necessary is not clear by this post, https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
It says they are selecting from both.  If you ask me they coded it, grab all names from both list, remove duplicates, weight account age, "random" select.  I really don't think you need both but as I said people on here seem to generally accept you need both.  If I get in with just one I'll let you know.  
---
For the record, this is just a meme.  I don't really care that much about getting in the beta.
---
My ideas for a couple potential Improvements/Techniques they could implement to make use of this layering "technology":
---
* **Layer transfers when grouping should not occur unless in the same zone.**  I can't think of any reason other than exploitable reasons that you'd need to transfer layers while not in the same zone as your party.  This would prevent most of those exploits we're worried about while not taking away the practical intent.  Pass map position icons to other group members regardless of layer and initiate layer transfer on summons.  
---
* **Dynamic population limits could solve a lot of Launch Day worries.**  Issues such as starting zone crowding and the initial determination of how many layers a server starts with, without having extremely unbalanced layer populations, could be fixed by forcing a low population limit per layer at launch and increasing them throughout launch day.  For example, with a 150 player cap per layer at launch, a 1500 player initial surge would create 10 layers with an average of 25 players per starting zone.  30 minutes later (average time to leave starting zone), the population limit could increase to 300 players per layer.  The initial 10 layers would then start funneling in new players and naturally smooth out population per layer and limit starting zone crowding.  Keep increasing this limit every 30 minutes throughout launch day and then start collapsing them when layers begin to decrease in population based on percentage of max to reach the steady state original vanilla population sizes.  I know this could be a "tuning" balancing act between rate of player logins throughout the day and rate of changing the population limits, but even badly tuned, this system would be better than trying to figure out how to smooth player loading distributions for large pop layers at launch as well as how many layers to start with.
---

pretty sure u can just invite them kinda like retail is now and u'll all join one specific layer.

**Any night elf:** Some variation on Ill√≠d√°n
---
I've played Blizzard games since Rock n Roll Racing on the SEGA. Never had a beta invite for a single Blizzard game, ever. Somehow my friend who talks shit about WoW and Diablo gets beta access to both though.
---
This. Had a few people in my guild discord never get an email, but the beta was available to download and play from battle.net app
---
Not arguing that. But every dungeon I run in FFXIV is quick and clean. Raids? Not so much.
---
Last time I tried to run a dungeon in retail WoW that wasn‚Äôt a Vanilla dungeon (I specifically remember a Black Rock Caverns run that fell apart in five minutes), the tank tried to grab everything in the first room when we didn‚Äôt even have a healer. We wiped, he ragequit. I spent an hour in that dungeon queue for nothing.
---
Tank was full health, he just lost nearly 40% of his hp on the first boss hit and died on the second hit.
---
60% mana is way enough for this encounter if you heal the tank.
---
clearly the healer fault here.
---
Yeah, I remember you had to start loading up your heal before the tank got in melee range for this boss or you could not guarantee his survival.
---
It is
---
Defilers Tabard!
---
Still wrong lol
---
1. These will be your last points. Vengeance is core to make ret actually kill shit, you want it asap. 
---
2. Flash of light is great. You don't need aoe healing. You don't even need to top people off. If the DPS is dieing it's pretty much their own fault. I'm not telling you not to heal them, but they should be bandaging themselves and watching their own threat levels. 
---
3. Depends on what is available and what's allowed when you get to 60. For leveling you don't need anything except a swing timer and maybe whatever the classic version of questie is going to be. 
---
4. It comes with experience. Just try to keep using your HoJ whenever you get a chance to stun something that does alot of damage. 
---
5. With 0 +healing gear your end rank spells are the most mana efficient things you can cast. The point of downranking is that when you get +healing gear you can apply your +healing to low rank low mana cost spells. Generally speaking flash of light is not going to do a ton of overhealing so you wont need to downrank to avoid that. Downranking will come into play once you start assembling your prebis gear. 
---
6. Expected to? No. Are people going to notice if you are going above and beyond to use your full toolkit? Yup
---
Do you have a clip of vanilla to prove that?
---
Anyone who wants a higher education than a bachelor's is likely going to be in school after age 24.
---
Wow classic is not wow vanilla üôÅ
---
So many changes
---
Not sure what's wrong. Do you have Wallpaper Engine?
---
They have a working 1.12 client and server for reference. If I had to guess I'd say numbers are inflated so folks can move through content and test stuff faster.
---
Blizzlike. Alternatively you can save it by doing a /reloadui after editing the settings.
---
Watched a lot of this 4 hour session. The dungeon seemed to be far more challenging than what you get on private servers, but it could be on account of how the guys were playing. Everything was hitting harder and dying slower.
---
I've had bun fights on here in the past, predicting that private server instances are far easier than the authentic classic versions based on how the original magnos codebase was set up. Will be interesting to see how it pans out.
---
I was with you until you tried to use edgy buzzwords like SJW. 
---
You‚Äôll find time and time again people who utilize the mass report issue we all complain about are either dick head trolls who didn‚Äôt get their way or people trying to eliminate AH/BG competition. 
---
Literally has nothing to do with SJWs or political issues at all. Stop being an asshole.
---
YEah, for a few weeks then layering turns off and it's back to normal.  Some people will try to exploit it but they'll mostly be leveling for the first week, giving just a couple weeks of exploit.  Probably some bonus black lotus when they inevitably find a way to do that.
---
Sucks but it's better than the alternatives... which I presume you have one that has less downsides?
---
Do they still get stuck in doors, I remember not being able to enter some buildings without dismounting.
---
this is the best idea
---
Are we the baddies?

Our society overvalues college. Many degrees do not produce anything. In a majority of cases, you are better off taking an apprenticeship of some sort. You come out with no debt, experience, and you're more hirable. This is coming from someone with an undergrad and a master's degree. More schooling isn't the answer; more "doing" is. 
---
This is before you even talk about the cost of education...
---
It does. I just never liked that change when it happened. First time I saw it I was like ewwww.
---
It just looks... funky haha
---
This was by class, not race.
---
I understand the point of a beta. What you don't understand is the concept of time management I think.
---
They have enough shit to fix. Shit that can and will be recreated by addons on day one should be on the bottom of the priority list. It is literally wasted development time.
---
Not really though
---
A sequel to this for the season 23 premiere would be epic because it would be only a few weeks after classic releases because South Park seasons usually start in September
---
I haven't played WoW since 2006. The graphics are just how I remember them :).
---
&gt; i even have videos of me back in the day doing random shit.
---
post the damn videos then
---
it probably *did* do too much damage compared with the private servers he's familiar with. 
---
Without starting another row about it, the original mangos codebase basically nerfed every dungeon and raid in the game for a variety of technical and design reasons, and it's a matter of argument to what extent subsequent developers have improved matters.
---
The commenter is speaking on the topic of classic low-level 5 man dungeons (which is what the original post was). Low-level 5 man dungeons in retail are faceroll. Not sure I'm following where the inconsistency is.
---
As someone who is way past that point: stop making personal attacks based on nothing. It won't get you anywhere positive in life, ever. I would be more than happy to agree on the dock measuring contest, but calling someone a complete idiot when that person has accomplished plenty in life is just a dick move and has no correlation to their intelligence in any way. Both my personal and work atmosphere are filled with ex-PhD candidates so welcome to the club and no I'm not impressed.
---
Keep the initial round of servers as 1.12 forever. I don't care what they do after that, as long as there's still the original offering available.
---
The vote is suprisingly close right now lol
---
You cannot accurately remember how something worked 14 years ago so it's a moot point.
---
F you watch them leveling...they are farrr from being assumed experts. They are people that enjoy talking nto a camera, nothing more. Some are knowledgable but most are not.
---
Ya, blizz has essentially handed these guys a living if they take it. To be fair I don't mind Esfand or Staysafe. It's Tips that proves time and time again he hasn't got a clue. Recent vid essentially saying how questhelper was a part of normal vanilla lol.
---
Oh, they are out there.
---
Shocking a game on a wide screen monitor looks different than it does on the generally more square monitors from 15 years ago.

It also doesn't help how rude he is....

I dunno, Solid Snake has told me that war has changed.

Mobs slide backwards instead of turning around to reposition themselves when you get too close.
---
The overall tone of this subreddit makes the entire retail game equivalent to low-level 5 man dungeons. It‚Äôs absurd as someone that loves both versions of the game.
---
Read the post again or check the link
---
Cool do that, have a nice day @work.
---
I'm readying my goosebumps for when I'm gonna level a NE Priest. That music gives me such a nostalgic feeling, it's insane. Can't wait &lt;3
---
If you can't be bothered to provide evidence for claims, stop making them. End of.
---
This was also the case during the Demo, and Blizzard confirmed the parries and misses were off. This is why we bugreport so they can go check it on their reference client.
---
Unfortunately I see a lot of people streaming the Beta who already went in with the mindset that how things work in the Beta is how it worked in Vanilla, even though things are already being shown to work incorrect (backstab while not facing the target f.ex)
---

Spirit is actually amazing for warriors early on, if you get enough of it you can effectively never stop. It's effect on Mana is actually less important.

Tauren hit boxes https://clips.twitch.tv/DeadTiredHareOhMyDog
---
I would love to progress to bc. My only fear is that what do you do post bc and wrath? Do you just start offering server progression through every expansion? It also starts splitting the community across even more servers and games the more expansions you introduce like that
---
It will still be a big hitbox for just one taurem, double tauren just exaggerates it I think

bye bye :)
---
World of roguecraft this is a classic that everyone should watch
---
I've put a few hours into beta so far and can provide some info:  
---
Mob density in caves has been reduced to vanilla values. You will find areas like the furbolg den in Teldrassil much less populated in classic.  
---
Bag drop rates have been reduced to vanilla values. Make friends with a tailor!  
---
Rep quest award rates have been reduced to vanilla values. Expect higher vendor prices for a little longer than you are used to on pservers. Eg small pouch will be 5 silver at level 10.
---
I did, modern one looks much better on a wide screen monitor.
---
Why because it's designed for the standard wide screen monitor.  It doesn't make anything faster or slower.
---
You forgot fresh servers.
---
Hardly changes the point he was trying to make dont you think?
---
Nothing more annoying than people nitpicking details while ignoring the point being made.
---
Same concept, whatever
---
"Combat reach" is the same for all and extends from the edge of hitboxes
---
Stuff you forgot to loot in dungeons get sent to your mail just like retail. Anyone else confirm?
---
Well your first video shows a tauren mage so clearly a Pserver and the second show TBC footage from 2012 so Pserver again, this is invalid.
---
I personally always enjoy Sodapoppin, he is a guy that definetly plays the game with passion however I think since it's only the beta people don't really take as much time as they would for the real release
---
I mean, I played in '04 and only graduated from my bachelor's 2 years ago, and am thinking of going back for grad school. Not that far fetched :P

I played back in classic. I was a real og gamer. I was also 5 at the time so I had no idea what the fuck was going on. Mostly ran around thunderbluff or herbed. My dad sold the flowers j found haha. Made home some good money afaik
---
Lol what? Tree dude always hit hard.
---
Just have the tank use demo shout, have the dps ready, and have the healer precast heals and spam them it isn't rocket science üòÇ
---
Can even kite tank if you need to.
---
Seems like none of these streamers who talk about vanilla actually played vanilla

Character selection screen left a retail feature in https://i.redd.it/ud21dd0gziy21.gif bug fix pls
---
Thanks. Can you confirm if the splash rep is happening. For example, if you complete a quest for 100 rep in SW, is it giving you 25 rep in the others?
---
Its probably because they've done this a leveling a hundred or more times. If you're looking for content, I suggest just not watching streamers and experiencing it yourself.
---
Otherwise just watch whichever streamer you like or think is funny. Only one I can stand is Asmonbald
---
&gt;Really glad that blizz chose the cr√®me de la cr√®me for their bug-reporting needs.
---
One douche represents the whole of the beta pool? That seems dramatic.
---
as others mentioned this has nothing to do with private server, that boss hits super hard (probably even more there than here) on private servers too. tips is just braindead
---
Was 20 when it came out, it fucked my life for over two years, worth it.
---
My bad didn't see the previous ones
---
Looks more like it's both.
---
That's even better yes :D
---
Where? I haven't seen anyone complaining. There's a "classic' settings button, that should be plenty to satisfy people.
---
Classic graphics are best graphics
---
its a very, very good game.  Its too slow for me, but its more similar to wow classic than it is modern wow
---
MrGM is a cool guy
---
I don‚Äôt understand how people watch these slobs.
---
Tier 0.5 is also a  pile of steaming garbage for dps, so yeah.

Well the game is a far-cry from what it was in its early iterations, so you of all people should understand how folks would want to enjoy what originally pulled them into the game. You seem to assume that because people want to be challenged, that Mythic+ raiding should sufficiently scratch the itch which is not necessarily the case.
---
That's a nice referral link you've got there...
---
It'd be a shame if you were to get banned.
---
Because 5 years is all a normal person needs for a masters. 
---
Doctors... and people doing phd excluded.
---
Nice, thanks for the reply :)
---
do explain how its lazy
---
please do
---
you don't really have demand in the first weeks of a server since most people are still leveling, you stack that sweet devilsaur leather up to sell it later when the masses want their prebis.
---
layering now means that the trihards will have not only 1 server to harvest when there is still not alot competition, but instead can jump layers and kill 12 devilsaur an hour instead of 3.
---
None streamers I have watched done suck at the game unfortunately. They can still be entertaining to watch though.
---
It's why this boss was kite tanked a lot - but you still need a healer ready to do their job XD
---
I was talking generally about people not understanding that one of the main purposes of this beta is to restore as much authenticity as possible. Sure this particular item is not high on the priority list, but the attitude I'm talking about is still present in this sub.
---
I still would pick the bow.
---
I have 2, one is WOW PTR and the second is called Classic PTR.   So when I opened my launcher I chose Classic PTR and was in.
---
This is sick, and the laughter after he gets melee'd from a quarter mile away is hilarious. This is the goofy shit I love about vanilla, fuck the whining for all the fun to get normalized. I hope people start accept it for what it is and learn to laugh about this kind of nonsensical stuff
---
Also yeah, it's also nice to see someone actually beta testing the game in a beta test. I'm glad they've got people like Perplexity mixed in with the obligatory clueless Wow streamers, I was on my toes as soon as I heard "Classic beta," knowing how that went for the last three expansions
---
Pretty sure that's intentionally left in.
---
!
---
I agree wholeheartedly with this.  The larger FoV made for a completely different experience than it is currently.  Going to Solliden Farmstead in Tirisfal Glades, for instance.  Back in vanilla the fields seemed HUGE compared to now.  It changes the immersion, in my opinion.
---
Something called looking up videos and archives and proving things by comparison instead of blatantly saying trust me i remember
---
This is pretty similar to my situation. I have an old vanilla account that has been active for at least part of every expansion. I played pretty heavily vanilla, tbc, wotlk without lapsing. My biggest gap was probably 2.5 years inactive in the cataclysm-mop era. I've been on and off since then. I reactivated my account about a week before the beta announcement and played bfa for the first time then. I got access to the beta, and then a few hours later got an email notifiying me about it last night.
---
This comment alone sums up everything on why Classic is so anticipated. Also is this a metaphor for life?????
---
Yes because he‚Äôs doing different things / has more people to group with than the alpha testers may have had. Did you even read the comment?
---
I had an imp named fizkip. He was so cute. I should check what my blueberry‚Äôs name was, I just remember being so mad about it.
---
It‚Äôs bad that I remember my imps name on a character I got to like level 30 13-15 years ago right?
---
if the druid just spammed mf/wrath woulda been a kill. evasion tank worked well and bought enough time.
---
I guess you could say that it's the crows coming home to roost, eh?
---
I agree that it‚Äôs all personal preference and that it was changed for a reason in Wrath, but I disagree with your latter point. If you have a 1.12.1 client running side by side with the BFA client you will definitely notice the difference. It‚Äôs actually extremely visible.
---
I would too tbh haha
---
This happens even in retail wow that's why you have to log after making changes like that.
---
That would be a fine outcome, and I am very glad those two streamers have decided to quarantine themselves.
---
Still, even smaller streamers are a problem. If there's a single streamer with 250 viewers, that viewerbase alone is 10% of a full server layer. I am a die-hard anti-streamer activist, and I sincerely hope for a server with 100% prohibition. Hopefully they will just wither away, but I will still advocate for preventative measures until Blizzard explicitly states they will not create such a server.
---
That's for Blizzard to decide. People should simply report all differences, no matter if they're gamebreaking or QOL. Blizzard can then decide what t keep/fix/ignore.
---
healer was shit, and could have healed better or dps'd it down, but wasnt his fault.
---
nah everyone who played pservers know that boss hits hard af, tips is just stupid; he fell multiple times on the little jumps
---
I hear you man.
---
Depression got me good between 2009 and 2015, dropped out of my English undergrad degree. Went back September 2015, just finished a Psych degree last spring, been doing a master's degree in community health sciences for a year now and loving life.
---
Life is like the first time playing WoW, for most of us it's not a mad blitz to 60, but congrats on the people who do choose to do it that way.
---
So no worries if things aren't exactly on track, as long as you keep plugging away at it you'll get there.
---
Thanks buddy :D
---
"Little" monetary gain. Classic will introduce millions upon millions of dollars in revenue.
---
I played in 04 and now I'm working on my MBA part time. silly meme

Of course it's visible it's supposed to be visible, part of the advantage of using the modern client is that it will improve things like having the engine optimized for wide screen aspect ratios.
---
That doesn't mean it makes the game faster or slower.
---
Had this problem with p99 and eq progression servers.  You end up remembering the emulated servers far more than the original experience.  Makes it really hard to accurately bug report .

If you join a party with that friend, you‚Äôll move to the same layer &amp; will stay on that layer until you party with someone from a different layer

I loved the visual effect of it.

Bored at school!
---
He is making an updated version for classic wow. You can support him again and have a fresh version, with an in game add on!
---
I'm not supporting it, I'm just repeating what I heard. It's an innocuous enough QoL addition that doesn't affect gameplay that they think it doesn't need to be removed.
---
And just like that it‚Äôs been removed.
---
"People who criticize these streamers are just jealous haters"
---
Awww downvotes. Soda fanboys mad
---
Because it's a nice little feature that people want and it does no harm to the actual game
---
Most of my classmates in grad school are around my age (30). It's really not as uncommon as you're making it out to be.
---
I don't recall Blizz sharing video proof. I'm not even sure if they fired up a 1.12 server to test how all the variables *look* when they play out on-screen. As far as I know they just ported the database over. I don't know how their client works, I'm not a programmer by any stretch of the imagination but I don't know if there are any client issues that could interfere with how data is handled between the server and the user.
---
That boss hits notoriously hard. The entire party is at fault here.
---
yeah the only question is should they ever launch fresh vanilla servers
---
i dont think we really need that
---
i started vanilla pretty late and was still able to do all the raids plenty of times
---
like the good thing about MC is its still worth running even when your guild is mostly in zg or aq gear. the nature of 40 man raids is you always need to recruit fresh blood and they need gear. people also always want the legendaries so i dont really think fresh classic servers needed
---
bc on the other hand i personally enjoyed a lot more than vanilla , the raids were fucking amazing , there was a lot of content , the classes all had a lot more power fantasy .
---
I dont see much point in them making new content for vanilla when bc was such a great and loved expansion. 
---
emerald dream, hyjal or kara would be the obvious choices to add on to vanilla but they have already done them , i cant really speak for how good or bad emerald dream was but i really enjoyed hyjal and kara. making up new raids for vanilla would be wierd when they have already done a take on all the obgious raids
---
i think it gets too far from the spirit of classic to start developing a second wow product on top of it when development should be focused on retail wow
---
There are definitely non FnF that have been invited. A friend of mine that started in like MoP or WoD was invited but out of the 10 or so FnF people I know (including myself) none of us got in. I'm assuming we will get hit in a slightly later wave and for now they just wanted to get a bunch of random people (and streamers) in rather than doing it how they typically handle betas where they send out FnF in the first wave.
---
There's a drop-down menu above the play button for wow labeled "REGION / ACCOUNT". If you're in you can select Beta: WoW Classic and install the classic client. There's only one world of Warcraft tab on the bnet launcher, and you swap between the beta and live bfa with the drop down menu.
---
I enjoy sodapoppin and asmongold because they‚Äôre funny to watch
---
TBC was my favorite time in WoW. While it was worse than Vanilla in some ways, I think it was better in more.
---
That said, my dream is that Classic is so successful, that it evolves into a different WoW 2.0 that goes in a totally different direction. I'm talking horizontal content, still at level 60, but maybe taking some ideas from other expansions to provide character progression and slightly better class balance. Obviously, I haven't fully thought through this, but I'd like to see something like it.
---
Shiz sorry I had no idea that did anything. Cheers done
---
Then you should look up a tutorial about how to screenshot and upload images.
---
Played priest, can confirm.  This wipe in the clip is something that happened all the time if not ready on this (and a lot of other bosses) in vanilla.  Pre-healing was a thing.  Healer should always be casting a heal, ready to either cancel or let it fire.
---
Potentially little. It's essentially free for people that are already playing and subbed to WoW.
---
WoW was first on twitch yesterday, beating the second place by more than 50k viewers and that was before even beta launch
---
&gt;People that played only on Private Server doesnt have really the right to submit "bugs" kek
---
This private server hate is getting really old. Especially when you consider the Demo had a huge list of issues that was pointed out by... wait for it.. private server players.
---
I might be wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure most weathers had different kinds of intensities.
---
Healers dps'ing wasn't really a thing back in vanilla, you saved every drop of mana, and stayed outside the 5 second rule when possible. 
---
 Even wanding (priest) can be dangerous as it triggers the gcd which prevents you from starting up a heal cast immediately if you need it.
---
I completely forgot about hunter dead zone.
---
Some monitors were set up that you couldn't do multiple degaussings. The monitor knew when it needed it and the coil wouldn't work otherwise.
---
It‚Äôs not pulled from them, the challenge is still there, they refuse to participate. Challenge is much more a la carte now which should make everyone happy.
---
Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre looking for validation in liking a game, more just sharing a story from their day. It‚Äôs nice talking to like-minded people who share your interests and ideologies.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=5168](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5168) 
---
You have all Timberling in Teldrassil listed there
---
Yup. Most of my classmates in grad school are around my age (30).
---
Over several several years with each person building on each others progress. With tons of bugs/inaccuracies, but hey who needs context right?
---
This one actually gave me a good laugh. Your subconscious was worried about ?? Warlocks so much that it had to remind you of that fear sleeping üòÇ
---
To the people who want horizontal content, how would you address the item level creep?  Arguably, the AQ and Naxx gear is pretty game-breaking as it is.  Adding even more powerful gear would certainly not be wise.
---
Who could have possibly imagined that these guys were full of shit the whole time!
---
I completely agree, it really scales the world down.
---
Wish I heard this before starting school.
---
Ok I did and I ignored it...
---
It's just the field of view making it seem that way.
---
There is no real answer to that. Some classes like mage, warlock, warrior and rogue will always do good dps. Feral druids can do good dps with the correct setup and tons of farming.     Feral tanks are really nice as offtanks or even maintanks on some fights. Even the paladin can be a useful AoE tank but it takes a lot of dedication to pull off.    
---
Hunters are quite weak in dps but they are not terrible, especially on longer fights they excel because they have infinite mana. They also have many niche roles in the raid like tranq shots, kiting, traps etc. You only notice the hunter when he doesn't do his job and holy fuck do you notice it allright as mobs are running haywire into your raid and the boss one-shots the tank.    
---
Paladins are excellent Nightfall wielders because they get double procs, we don't know if this will be true on Classic. If it isn't then they are pretty garbage tbh.
---
Moonkins are pretty bad though. They run out of mana and their spells don't hit very hard. Doesn't mean you can't bring one. We had a PvPer who basically only dpsed a bit, provided the ranged with the crit aura and innervated a healer (usually me hehe) and grabbed whatever the ranged didn't want anymore and that was his job. In a 40-man raid you can afford having a couple players like that. What guilds generally want is for those to be very dedicated and consistent at the game. I've seen it work and I've seen it not work very well...
---
They must be quite confident that all the higher level content/mechanics work as intended
---
My brother's uncle's nephew's wife tanked on one famous private server and texted me to say it did look like the whole dungeon was doing more damage than what they were familiar with, but idk.
---
I came out of the womb on a university track. When I finished high school, I went straight to college, worked for 10 years in my field, went back for a master's degree and now work in my field again. It was what was expected of me and what I wanted.
---
the OP and comments like the above are just silly yo
---
Still wrong combat text being used, needs to use the old combat text as the new one is way to subtle and horrid.
---
Atleast let us use the old ones as a addon or a option ingame, the new combat text is so dull...
---
So I guess there‚Äôs no downsides to no layers, like thousands of players all in the same zone, right?  
---
Because nothing says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having fun‚Äù. Like running at 5 FPS and being stuck in the starter zone for a week.
---
These guys put the Beta on their backs. Super good stream actually testing and reporting stuff.
---
You can turn on and set the intensity in the wow command line
---
Oh that‚Äôs precious. But that‚Äôs fine you just never get to log out or die or let him die for eternity. No big deal.
---
except that is vanilla and we are getting completely different graphics settings from the beginning? what other argument do you want?
---
Your comment is flawed, which might be a product of unefficient interpretation.
---
As you can see pretty quickly, my argument wasn't "basically" to provide a "job" to a lesser individual. It was to send both positively and negatively attuned individuals into beta-tests.
---
Really? Long monotone boring as fuck woethles hype videos from private server kids, even tips is better than those two.
---
well gives us new models then.
---
I am sadly yet to squee.
---
I bought one lol
---
Technically they are testing all the quests, mobs, npcs (etc) they are encountering, even though they are rushing to 30.
---
I‚Äôm under the impression that not enough people are aware of this. Like I said some of the recent streamers have said ‚Äúit feels like we‚Äôre moving too fast‚Äù
---
Very nice, how much?
---
Plenty of non streamers have been getting in lol.
---
Idk why people are spreading nonsense like they‚Äôre the only ones.
---
Well yes, every class needs stamina for leveling.
---
&gt; building a career on twitch
---
He's had a career on twitch for a while now dude.
---
Warrior Charge was a bit messy back then.
---
You could charge impassible terrain if a target was in LoS ( any Hills ) and sometimes no
---
That's true, I do remember light and heavy sandstorms in Tanaris, it gave the zone a really nice feel.
---
I dont know why you expect the game to cycle through multiple different weather patterns in the first few hours of the Beta but.. Just have some patience? If the weather remain the same for days we can maybe say its missing.
---
Well yeah because I fucked up the first time playing video games, so I'm going back to college at 28.
---
most people i know want classic to be like vanilla. layering is in opposition to that.
---
2
---
Well at least we know who the triggered people are. hehe :)
---
Private server kids are not good testers, they don‚Äôt know vanilla. Like when tips said quest arrows on minimap were in vanilla...
---
They have Tip tanking what do you expect.
---
JOANA
---
*Every* degree has value. It's just that most people either can't or won't go to where the jobs are. And while you are correct about overvaluation, a decent section of the population desires higher education because not everybody wants to be a welder. Not that there's anything wrong with being a welder, because my younger brother is one.
---
I cant either, however theres a big group of people who watch hardcore ironmen and high end PvM. A couple streamers are just entertaining. Occasionally there's PvP events which are defenitely something to watch like Deadman or PvP championships.
---
I took a 6 year break because I hated school. Ive gone back because im finally ready...
---
So it's okay because it's minor? Seems like a bad argument
---
did you even read? I said it would be nice if it was the default setting, then if someone wants to change by all means.
---
I played in '04. I was there, man. I'm still in school...
---
^(PhD)
---
Kargoz. Don't know if he's on twitch but he is very passionate about the game.
---
Nah.  It had been pretty lackluster for a long time, but theyve actually gone back to it being pretty intense now at times.
---
Where did you hear this?
---
Yeah, its getting boring watching streamers try to play and complain about the game. 
---
Nothing in beta matters though really so fuck it.
---
No not at all, but it does affect how fast or slow the character movement is, as well as the general scale of the world.
---
From my memory this wasn't vanilla. They indeed had bigger hit boxes but this is much more pronounced than anything I can recall.
---
Thats definately a bug. It would mean you can equip some really high stam weapon combo to give yourself slightly more HP for when the initial Aimed Shot or whatever is about to land on you in PvP.
---
tbh i never liked the glitchy nature of it, im glad its out of the game right now... :3
---
well, tips is a remarkably bad player. He got lost in the instance multiple times
---
&gt; like it happens on any vanilla private server
---
this whole thread, ffs
---
I was in HS in 04 and I'm just finishing college now.
---
Cancer and drug abuse may me lag just a bit..
---
Yeah. Because they keep skipping classes to play WoW.
---
His "opinion" reaches such hights of absurdity that frankly I can't imagine a real person thinking this "takes away from the experience" and can only assume it's someone making a joke. 
---
I get that you're playing devil's advocate for him, but, come on...
---
Not correct my man. Their reference client is not based on BFA. They have a client based purely off of 1.12, but they had problems getting proper integration with new systems on that client, which is why they had to strip features away from the a legion client. The beta is based on the stripped Legion client, but they still have the 1.12 reference client they can use to compare with when looking at bug reports.
---
You don't have the real values so how would you know if they're correct. No ones played REAL vanilla in 14 years. Private servers don't count.
---
I see. I really misunderstood how they created classic in the new client. TYVM for the clarification, I appreciate that!
---
"Tauren is new best race"
---
 What's this "new" business? Beefybois always been God SS tier.
---
 Glad to see the rest of the world coming into the new age of enlightenment, though.
---
What? Then what if they wouldn't have even given u the option to switch? I'm saying since it's supposed to be classic they should have left everything by default, then if someone wants to fiddle around with the setting who cares.
---
&gt; they should just get rid of the new shadows and graphics too
---
They have though
---
I'm not a developer but I'd assume either catch-up dungeons or some gear squishes.
---
I can't fathom the idea of people thinking they can make everyone happy with their suggestions again... Not only many want 2 expansions but many also want Classic+. Many want only Classic vanilla, many want fresh servers to start over eventually. Many will want that for every "type" of WoW or expansion that could be released. No one wants Sharding.
---
I mean, how many people do you expect will play this and how much can you split that community? 
---
"Its fine as long as its follows vanilla". Literally no idea if people even make a single attempt to look a bit further than this sentence...  10 threads a day, not a single argument than "i trust blizzard", "the can follow the old philosophy". Yea right, it's that simple. Take that risk and turn this shit into BFA yet again. Changes bring changes, changes bring different people over time, different people turn a game into something it wasn't.
---
He gets a lot of hate around here but I find Tipsout to be pretty watchable. I think all of the big streamers are leveling pretty quickly though, you might be better off looking for a small streamer who got invited the normal way.
---
Lots
---
it‚Äôs NOT A TOY
---
Wow dude all these streamers are shit at the game
---
Well, it's not my personal definition. It's the standard for these words in the gaming industry.
---
assuming each expansion takes a couple years and is popular i would not be surprised if there was demand for expansions after wrath
---
for sure it would split the community but they wont do it unless there is a lot of demand so there should be enough players so each expansion has active players.
---
all you need is a sub so i see no reason to not be active on 2 or more servers
---
you are right though the concern would be splitting the community too much
---
for now i just think bc is a better option than then developing content for classic
---
development effort should go into the retail product 
---
it would end up being wow 2.0 if they started developing classic content
---
Top quality! and can't wait for my old Thrall back in hes comfy chair!
---
Dat mustache tho
---
So you tested it in beta? Got a video link?
---
I think it would be a nice touch and people would commend the devs if they found a way to put it in the game. 
---
I don't think it's a deal breaker for anyone if they don't.
---
Met a guy like that back in '07, was a Guadsman who got activated in 2003 and basically took the better part of the next decade to finish a degree he started in 2002. This was back when the Guard and reserve units were being mobilized left and right.
---
Around this sub, on steams etc. I haven't seen anything official from Blizzard.
---
It was a failure at all ends.
---
Tank pulled too aggressively. Tank charged in and went out of range for healer.
---
Healer wasn‚Äôt full mana.
---
Healer isn‚Äôt that great
---
Dps was lagging because of the quick pull
---
Retail kiddies front and center on this video.
---
I meant the updated classic graphics not bfa
---
Sorry I wrote the wrong thing, I‚Äôm referring to how fast or slow it looks not how fast or slow it actually is.
---
What are you even comparing this too?
---
i know that grey quests give full rep in tbc and was under the impression that it was a tbc change, not vanilla.  i know later vanilla added spillover rep which greatly increased overall rep gains but haven't read anything about grey quests.
---
The problem is, all these "Little" things that are intentionally left in all add up. Where does it end? watching people on stream and man it looks easy as hell. (2004 player here)
---
Haha yeah, I realized that after I subbed to check.
---
Glad I did though since it seems to have gotten me the beta invite.
---
Yeah no, I'll @ you when they fix it to tell you you were wrong
---
What he said. Has not been a bad launch day in many years.
---
If you consider something a child could do hard...
---
Are you telling me that these people claiming they remember the exact mana regen numbers from when they played as an 8 year old might be pserver frauds?
---
Yesterday he reported that a quest chest‚Äôs respawn time was incorrect...based off of??? Who the fuck knows...i don‚Äôt think this guy knows what a bug is
---
Holy shit my comment was downvoted into oblivion, I actually don't know why folks don't like him - proper question!
---
Do you have a link? Ive definitely heard that Tauren have larger swing distances. I guess I'm confused on why the two taurens wouldnt have bigger range against eachother than orc/tauren give the different hit box size you mention
---
Sorry but that's a "insert x class besides hunter" weapon, brah
---
I think this is an important distinction to keep in mind.
---
That said, I also think it's important to bug report everything that seems suspect and to be thorough. They stated their goal was to be as authentic as their implementation can be, and to that end I do think the feedback and debate is still valuable.
---
Also your supposed to kite that boss in retail vanilla.
---
Can you do anything else or contribute in any way to this topic instead of just being toxic?
---
OSRS also have people that quit and many that demand "true vanilla" OSRS. Bu i guess as long it's the masses way, everyone else can go to hell.  Also blizzard isn't Jagex.
---
I don't know he makes me laugh. That's really all I want out of a streamer. I know some people want to see raw mechanical skill, drama, boobs, collab projects, etc.
---
I just watch the streamers that I think are funny. I think Asmon is funny.
---
so this got me going down a rabbit hole and [this article](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181112-severely-deficient-autobiographical-memory-is-surprisi) is the closest thing to what I would say I experience as "memory", specifically this passage:  
---
"For her, past events are experienced almost as if they were in the third person, as if they could have been someone else's past episodes." It's like the memories I do have from back then, when I recall them it's more like I'm watching a movie about myself with someone else playing my role, rather than "seeing" it from a first person POV, and I don't really recall what I was feeling or thinking at the time. But at least now I think I have a name for it and can do some research, so that's something...
---
So you know as much as I do, thanks
---
The "automatically track quest" checkbox doesn't work.  But it didn't work in vanilla either, as I recall.
---
Worth mentioning, because I'd like it to actually work.  It's not really about vanilla gameplay.
---
Did they update Raggy, Onyxia...?
---
I can assure you daze is in.
---
You mean you didn't have the time of your life holding the hands of nervous 8 year-olds as they jumped into Razorfen Kraul?
---
Won‚Äôt know for days. Only a handful of things on the AH as of last night when I went to bed. Mostly joke stuff like apples for 99,999 gold lol
---
They said they may raise the cap or provide premade characters at a higher level to test endgame content at a later date.
---
I didn't address your other points because I don't contend them, if tf2 is doing that like you said, that is also extremely shameful. 
---
Gambling addiction has almost nothing to do with money, it's about brain chemistry and the dopamine rush of pulling the lever, in fact gambling addicts will very often get upset when they win big money, the reason is that it requires them to get up and go claim it from the casino; takes away from their time at the slot machine.  I'll explain more on my next break.
---
&gt; My brother's uncle's nephew's wife
---
this sounds so much like satire but I still feel like its serious
---
Yeah, I know - but unlike a paid contract they're not really obligated to any terms like specific playtimes.
---
Report it as a bug. This is a beta, not early release.
---
Do u see how few people are online? There was like 50 people online on horde on the pvp server recently when soda checked.
---
I noticed one streamer claiming they played at launch but they would have been 12.
---
Yeah I understand, just don't normally see people admit to liking him. I personally don't mind watching him over the likes of Towellie, but if I had the choice I'd watch someone who can actually play the game *and* entertain me.

I've only been in Teldrassil so far, and confirm that the only rep being given there is Darnassus. I'll be testing a lot more and will update when I see some splash rep happening.
---
You realize what beta is for right?
---
Hey what's up guys madseason here with another classic video. Bummer though, I like his vids
---
It feels like it but you‚Äôre not. I would prefer to have it running the way it then with crap graphics and feels like I‚Äôm walking slower.
---
Well because most people do it, it must be the right thing then huh? How close minded are you? Everyone makes their own life choices and LOTS of people go to school at an older age once they've experienced some real life.
---
Absolutely needs to be in the game.
---
I don't see the point in min/maxing in vanilla. 
---
It's all going to be figured out already. Who would I be impressing? Not anyone else, and most importantly not myself.
---
If I want to challenge myself and play with more complex rotations and a higher skill ceiling and compete, I'll go play retail.
---
Vanilla is for a slower pace and adventure and the journey, it's about the people you play with. 
---
There's nothing to prove, achievements in vanilla aren't as impressive anymore because A.) it's been done before over a decade ago and B.) time spent and luck matter a lot more than actual proficiency and skill
---
So thats why the Barrens got all screwed up.
---
that makes sense
---
I LOVE IT! Retail kiddies getting fucking pissy at each other because they are used to care bear shit!
---
Some guy made a youtube video saying it was good, so therefore it's okay now.  Also be prepared for warriors rolling on staves with good damage numbers on them, because that was also in the video.
---
Remember, this is vanilla.  Everything you do, your guild does, your faction does, your entire server does, is to cater to the whims of warriors, because they have it "so much harder\*".  That's actually the point of the whole game.
---
\*in 2004 WoW in general was considered an absurdly easy game where you could breeze through max level, even as a warrior, compared to any other MMORPG
---
It's the same beta style they ran back in the Overwatch closed beta. Lit. no one got invited. You have to be very lucky. Maybe things change at stresstest.
---
Great question.
---
&gt;frame your argument in a way that isn't so authoritative and leaves room for you (and the shithole psevers) being wrong.
---
I'm arguing the exact same way everyone else is, someone claims a bug exists, everyone gangs up and says blizzard couldn't possibly be wrong and that person is just a private server retard. Plenty examples of this in this thread, and I'm not talking about myself.
---
&gt; Maybe it will be proven there's a slight issue. But I find it far more likely Blizzard got it right and that people are reacting based on Pserver experiences.
---
Most people in the community who can't possibly fathom blizzard getting anything wrong (like you), already had the exact same reaction when people claimed the regen (and several other mechanical issues) was completely busted. It's the default by now. You guys will be proven wrong yet again and the same will repeat when a new issue pops up.
---
It's a hot enough topic that youtubers will want to talk about and make plenty of videos about, just gotta wait a bit.
---
no, the reason classic wow was created in the first place to to recreate the old game for "historical" reasons, kind of like a museum exhibit.
---
I fail to see what that has to do with the fact that not only streamers are getting invites.
---
Did he ever sit in it? I remember him just standing in front of it.
---
Yeah they seem pretty serious about keeping it small. I have a friend with a pretty high position at blizzard and they haven't been able to get me an invite. So..... Yeah small.
---
I do agree vanilla feels slower due to the fog even if you are moving the same speed. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good thing.
---
It doesn't matter what I say or how I say it, you'll be mad either way and down vote. lol super predictable people
---
looks like C&amp;amp;C ion cannon xD
---
if you dont care, why argue in the first place?
---
i think little things like this and wall climbing added to the charm of vanilla
---
i hope for a product as close as possible to classic
---
The fact you think Blizzard giving streamers beta keys is a disgusting practice. When they are the people most able to share the joy with others. Also says a lot about you. It says your a retard.
---
Nice to see the face of the community making a complete fool of himself as per usual
---
Yup, this sub is becoming shitty. Now that we have content to actually consume, we can watch that instead of read post after post about shills complaining about layering, no progressive itemization and Bnet integration.
---
It could act up similar to this video if both players were moving and/or lag were a factor, but those are hardly a factor so this is clearly just off.  Basically the extremes seem to be the norm atm...
---
Except, you know, it's in the game... That doesn't mean won't be removed but I'm just basing my prediction on what is currently the reality.
---
I doubt a child could do it just like that but you're probably not being literal
---
It matters very little how fast or slow it LOOKS as king as they are moving the same speed
---
weve known it wouldnt be a thing for a while, since the blizzcon demo
---
Stuff like this is cool.  Always weird to think of people sharing an experience with you but experiencing some aspect of it very different from a sensory perspective .
---
Yep. That's my story. 14 or 15 in 2004. 30 now. 
---
Depression got me good between 2009 (2 years into my English degree) and 2015 when I went back to school for a psych degree (switched my major from English). Finished my undergrad last year and hopped right into a masters degree in community health sciences that I've been working away on for a year :).
---
&gt;checking what is wrong on private servers
---
must be a big list
---
Everybody is jealous of the streamers getting to play so they're raging about them not reporting bugs.
---
It was uploaded to youtube in 2012. Footage is from 2008.
---
https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=82055
---
Why would a private server player ask "Blizzard please fix"?
---
If I had seen this in my Network Engineering class, I probably would've gotten higher than a B, lol.
---
There was a tbc mod that changed zone music, was one of my favorites. Used a python script. Not sure if it existed in vanilla.
---
On topic, after playing last night, I can say that I don't think it hurts the game to get some cosmetic upgrades. You can manually set them down, though the water comparison is a nice example; minecraft quality vs liquid metal at low vs ultra.
---
Don't care about min/maxing at all. I'm gonna play how I want like I always do and even raid when I eventually get there.
---
Mine was Charlos lmao
---
Not only for streamers.   There are some of us that have access (yes I'm one of them), I don't have a twitch channel, nor a youtube channel, I'm not a creator or media of any sort.  Maybe I and some others just fit through the small holes of other people that received beta invites.   However I do agree that many of the streamers got access strictly because they are streamers (free advertising) that either never played Classic, or were anti Classic in the past.  Which sucks.
---
Lul at the salty cucks complaining about streamers not reporting bugs....
---
Your probably joking but if not go to the ER. Like now....
---
Start your sentence with "I predict" problem solved
---
I had access this morning when I checked my bnet launcher, but apparently I got the invite late last night at just before 11 eastern.
---
I got one ! :D
---
YOU ARE THE MVP, THANKS &lt;3
---
only buy if you want the rag statue they are putting the mounts in the cash shop for some reason
---
Yup. I would always be rolling my biggest heals on the tank before pull. Then we‚Äôd have dps go crazy until the boss was dead.
---
Whenever I am sick, I get issues with light sensitivity too... Something to do with my sinuses and pressure on my eyes or something. A doc explained it to me once so now I pop decongestants like candy and go to work
---
I think counting 12k people per server is a bit of an overstatement, also the chance that one guy out of 12k is getting the idea of farming devilsaur leather is a bit weird.
---
I see your point yes, but I don't think it as Overtuned as you think.
---
More than vanila? hell yeah! But no way he will get 12 per hour.
---
I‚Äôm starting to think you are worried.
---
Not really worse graphics, just a different field of view. It doesn‚Äôt really look worse at all imo, I have tested it on a widescreen monitor and it doesn‚Äôt really come with any downsides that I can think of.

Thanks OP for giving the inspiration.
---
Literally yesterday I was watching his stream thinking "this guy isn't bad at all. Reddit is just overdramatic." But yeah... the fact that he reported a bug for this is just sad.
---
If people make small mistakes they are more likely to make big mistakes
---
Honestly, this sub is super toxic. I only stay subbed for updates or that 1 useful post per week from someone who compiled info. The people want the game as close to vanilla as possible because they want to live in the past. The amount of crying and "no change" reeeeeing makes it seem like they'll even buy an old ass monitor to play this
---
ummm... what?
---
Congrats on [Wirt's Third Leg](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9359/wirts-third-leg)!
---
Wouldn't worry. The people rolling just because will get left behind long before 60.
---
Oh tips sucks i didn't know thx for reminding me
---
honestly though, i wouldn't be surprised if his thought process was "this is stupid and toxic af, if i do this people will probably clip it and maybe my channel will grow"
---
Jesus Christ, I hope these people aren't the ones determining how Classic will be handled. Reporting a bug because keyboard mashing didn't work, smh
---
I agree after seeing that i kind of unfollowed. Hes garbage and sadly people follow him and turn garbage too
---
can you make one for mage
---
&gt;  we didn't know 
---
speak for yourself, it was already explained a few weeks back that you can play classic on old-school graphics or newer graphics with lots of groundclutter etc...
---
Considering it's a button combination, finding a file and a dropping and dragging it's really not much of an exaggeration. An 11 year old could definitely do that. I can't believe you've spent this much time pretending to not know how to upload an image when you could've provided us all with some proof of your claim. But apparently I'm in the wrong here.
---
Says the guy, trying oh so hard but knows oh so little
---
he was also level 19 and I think the boss is quite a bit higher.
---
My son rolled his first toon (undead warr) when he was 5. I was actively playing and he watched me all the time. 
---
He's now a very active paladin healer on private servers and is chomping at the bit for classic.
---
&gt;  a player will have possibility to hop through layers and abuse this system
---
But you have no idea if that's the case you are just making assumptions.
---
There is absolutely no way they go into this without safeguards. Not sure the last time you played retail but you used to be able to "realm hop" which was being able to instantly go to a different phase in any area of the world just by joining a group in the group finder.
---
They put a stop to this by requiring you to be in the same zone as the person who invited you.
---
They aren't stupid, they realize people will be looking to take advantage of layering. They will for sure do something to stop it, like a cooldown or making you be in a rested zone before you can switch layers.
---
Shield Block is nice on him too.
---
well didnt almost everyone have QuestHelper back then? I havent seen the video but from what I remember everyone and his dog had QuestHelper, CT Raid Assist and TitanBar
---
Settle down
---
Even Taliesin, someone who was AGAINST Classic, got an invite and she didn't. Goddammit Blizzard
---
I am not a streamer. I streamed on twitch one time ever to learn how. I got into the beta. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs based off of sub time more than anything. I have had an account active since month 1 of vanilla. Except for 8 months during WOD. (My guild died and the game was in a bad state).
---
I got a beta invite. While I saw a lot of streamer names in chat and playing during my session last night I‚Äôd say 95%+ were names I didn‚Äôt recognize and I watch a LOT of wow YouTubers and Twitch streamers. 
---
This streamer only narrative needs to stop. It‚Äôs factually not true.
---
People complain that everyone will know what the fuck they‚Äôre doing this time....nope.
---
Clearly Classic is much harder than private servers, I haven‚Äôt played in 10+ years, and the retail kiddies are going to do stupid shit like this.
---
Thats actually surprisingly cute and wholesome
---
Get a hooker.
---
Pretty sure the size of their dead zone is the same, it just starts a few yards further away.
---
I mean this was player error but ok.
---
Are you really this upset about the ability to move your characters where you want?
---
This sub is like those facebook pages that go like " only 19xx kids remember", everyone likes to suck eachothers dick because to them their life sucks so much that the best thing they can do is hating shit just for the fun of it, to which sheep idiots follow. this subreddits name should be changed to  /r/gatekeeping ,
---
I played on private servers a fair amount and rarely encountered players as bad as what I see in this clip.  It's not the content here, it's the players.  The healer was dpsing lol.
---
Yeah, I started playing in 05-06 when I was around 6 years old. Quit a bit after wrath came.
---
5 months late, but you guys are nuts. You can get to level 40 in the first 48 hours of a server and have 100 gold from just questing.
---
Why is someone who makes money on creating content for youtube/twitch inherently a piece of garbage? Like what fucking imaginary clown world does your mind live in where these people are going to spend hours and days creating content and outright refuse to receive anything in return for it? This isn't a fucking art student utopia or some shit where we're all painting and doing street performances all day. 
---
By your standard, literally anyone who's made money doing anything is a piece of garbage.
---
Seriously, how old are you people? Grow the fuck up
---
It's going to mess with speedruns strats for-sure.
---
Yeah this has crossed my mind. Some of those guys are going super tryhard. Just not my thing though I guess.

pserveur are not accurate
---
Ya I reworded. My bad.
---
People think beta = early access
---
Is 30 the cap?
---
Tank was also only level 19
---
Yup, and I'm gonna be hitting up every dungeon I can :)
---
Programming is also an oversaturated field and the bubble is going to bust soon. Just like nursing.
---
Yeah.. can't wait for the expansions again that this subreddit is some how already dying to be introduced.
---
i agree. i think it will become popular opinion to have quality of life changes or class changes after the game has been out for some time.
---
i would prefer they try and stay true to the source material and not make changes because they become popular requests.
---
i would not be surprised if increasing xp rates becomes a popular request after the game is out a while or hairlooms ; just because something like that becomes a popular request its not true to the game
---
i just want to be able to play vanilla like super mario or any other classic game
---
Yeah the order of your characters totally impacts gameplay
---
Also means harder to dodge AOE spells.
---
It's not a moot point. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good
---
Actual real memory of classic, while imperfect, still beats out not having any memories of it at all.
---
You have the choice between inaccurate memories or no memories at all, inaccurate memories win by far.
---
Plus, some classic players have old videos screenshots notes etc saved. It's impossible to have such content saved if you never created it.
---
I recall the first time in VC having some issues with aggro on the ship where some of the mobs in the ramp going up would aggro on us as we walked under the scaffolding. So we hopped on the giant waterwheel for safety. It‚Äôs been over a decade (and this was in TBC, so maybe something changed) but I believe that is how they acted, but i believe they were in Evade mode until someone hopped off the wheel.  
---
I think there was also talk of a way to cheese Greenskin by having a ranged class or the healer stand on a cannon, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen it work
---
Started High School in '04, So I started a bit later on but still played in classic/vanilla
---
Exactly. I started playing WoW at launch when I was a sophmore in high school and have gotten back into it off and on since then during the course of a military enlistment, university, and now grad school.
---
Ready to return to those good ole days dueling in front of Org eating pizza rolls at 11 pm!
---
Yeah he doesn't hit fast so shield block prevents most crushing/crit from coming through.
---
Improved shield block makes it much easier.
---
I legit rolled Tauren in TBC for this exact reason, they had a 7yd melee-reach as opposed to the normal 5yd which gave you an incredible advantage in arena when opposition tried to pillar-kite.
---
Worked the other way around, 7yd hitbox.
---
Why is your Tuesday in the Sat/Fri box on your calendar. Please correct.
---
And you wonder why ppl were in favour of loot trading to make grouping with dickwads like this slightly more bearable.
---
To which I'd like to add that this is a beta, and very soon all will get to play, but talking to people here feels like talking to kids, they just scream on your face and insult you.
---
I still fucking love this episode. So damn good.
---
You misread my comment.
---
This inspires me to actually play a tank.  I forgot how good it felt to shepherd people through a run successfully.
---
Priest. 
---
Every group needs a healer. It‚Äôs what I played before and I absolutely enjoyed it.
---
And then everyone clapped.
---
maybe later in vanilla, my first 60 had no quest helper. (tho i did have Titan lol)
---
Can confirm this is true. I was also applauding.
---
I got my invite today, and I am a day 1 subscriber and I have an active sub right now, but I've only had it for a few weeks. I don't have BFA.
---
Honestly both versions of water are bad. I prefer the vanilla water after seeing it again on a pserver shortly before the classic announcement. It's a little too tiling but it's pretty.
---
I hope there's an addon that lets me customize and add new music. I like the vanilla music, but I like a lot of the music added later, too. I'd love to add a few extra tracks to Ashenvale or something.
---
I started wow as 5 in 2006 couldn't play classic as a baby unfortunately :(
---
Daze is in every major private server
---
I think I just assumed he'd be using shield block üò≠
---
But yeah he doesn't even have it on his bars? What are they lvl 20? Don't you get shield block before then?
---
Waiting for that Best Buy release to get it for $80
---
My old CRT fucking exploded in my face when I was questing through the Wetlands.

There was a very loud pop and a crackle. And then there was smoke. The monitor obviously died.

And I‚Äôm failing around, slapping the monitor because I can hear my Rogue being eaten by a crocodile.

Those shitty shitty days. Those were the days.

---
When I started in Vanilla, one of my buddies from Ventrilo rolled a lock.  His Imp's name was, 'Pagmat'.  I was way into the level 30s before I realized this was just a random name for his pets.  I would be in dungeons, asking to locks to pull out their 'Pagmats' for the HP buff. 
---
Really looking forward to Classic.
---
Hand of Edward the Odd?
---
I mean, it's beta day 1, there's a level cap, none of it matters.  I am super anti ninja in general but this doesn't hurt anyone.  Sodapoppin rolled need on like thirty green items he isnt ever going to use in the same run.  People need to relax.
---
Yes, that boss did massive damage.  One of the design choices in most vanilla dungeons, even the early ones, was to have a boss much higher level than the start of the dungeon.  Some dungeons the starting mobs would even be grey if you outleveled the final boss iirc.
---
And yeah between broken gear, and other factors it was completely normal.
---
I'd much rather they put up new servers for TBC and let us poll on what to remove from that expansion.
---
Well it‚Äôs a good thing classic wow wasn‚Äôt made for you then isn‚Äôt it. Who gives a shit about cosmetics, it should be gameplay &gt; everything else.
---
bc if lucky
---
classic wow is not wow 2.0 there is no need to develop new content
---
they develop new content for the retail wow product
---
Any chance we can get a printable version of this? I have a lot of difficulty reading off a computer screen and would love to print this out. The google doc says I cannot do this though. :(
---
Order a ton of groceries Monday morning, smoke myself into a coma after delivery, wake up confused and angry because it'll only be 3:30pm.

Tkzzzzzznnnnt
---
This is a comment my grandpa would write about people.
---
Because claiming regen is wrong based on a 15 year old memory of something as trivial as low level regen is fucking stupid. None of these claims are being substantiated. Meanwhile we have people in this thread doing the math and posting videos from vanilla showing regen is accurate, or worst case very close to accurate, and not the ‚Äúlol BFA version of vanilla‚Äù hyperbole being thrown around.
---
Could you imagine in PvP? Hahah you would get hit by any and every AOE going off in the map.
---
wHaT hAppEnDs aFtEr ClASSiC
---
Warriors were broken and op in 1.12 also.  But they needed gear to get there.
---
The mechanic that reduces the frequency of daze when you are low level might not be included in private servers.
---
Don't reward them for choosing this scummy approach to testing a product. Just wait the next 100 days and pay for it when it's actually been launched.
---
you know when little kids have a crush on another little kid and they tease them? That's this sub with tips/some other youtubers. They literally sit in this sub and piss and moan all day about them because they're actually in love with them
---
My 10-year-old brain didn't even know addons were a thing until much later. So it was all quest text for me, lol! I think it genuinely helped with reading comprehension, though, cause that was usually a strong suit of mine in school.
---
I hope by then people stop making these threads.
---
It is definitely Bubblehearth
---
We had the quest log which copied the quest title into the chat bar. We then highlight the text and cut it, minimised the game and pasted the quest name into thot. That then gave us the coordinates to the quest objectives and a forum of replies by the players under the main text. 
---
I could do that action with my eyes closed to this day and it sure as hell beats following an arrow.
---
Theres a chance im mixing it up with a different one, but doesnt it *still* hit fairly hard on retail?
---
Edit: Hrm...i wonder if im thinking of Dire Maul or something.  Now im not sure...
---
Mad season , frostadamus and Kargoz
---
Tips is a hit or miss and he misses 2/3 times so no
---
How are these 2 things even comparable? 
---
Moonwalking has to do with the way the game is coded on the 7.3.5 client and it would take actual effort to recreate.

The only reason Nogginfogger wouldn't work is if they went out of their way to disable it, which they obviously would not.

they're so bad lmao. turning back to boss and jumping away ayyyyy
---
Still beats something that never did. A base point is somewhere to start.
---
Play the game, stop gloating
---
This is not a bug. Taurens had bigger hitboxes and longer melee range, therefore bigger ranged deadzone.
---
Seems like NA is favoured more from what i can see, Wondering do they have like a US/EU server or is it just a server in the US?
---
my favorite content creator is platinum wow, he is fairly new but he has some great quality edits! i suggest you check him out

Millions? They‚Äôre not exactly streaming Fortnite over here.

His chest piece is broken. Healing in vanilla means having to be smart and heal before hits land sometimes
---
Sucks thinking lore will...
---
Tipsout's skill is subpar... He played 1000s of hours on private servers and still sucks. Would not recommend watching if you want to get better/learn.
---
1/2 influencers , 1/2 random I would say
---
I agree with the other guy responding. You're implying there is more than one different solution which is better.  Care to give an example of one?
---
I wish people would stop posting this thread every 5 minutes.
---
It's so much easier to select my character now, it's really ruined the classic experience for me.
---
Or poll whether or not to add another a raid before tbc or content that was in concept that was never added, like emerald dream or something.
---
Dude if you really believe that the ROI on Classic won‚Äôt be in the 100s of millions then you are not paying attention.
---
Never heard of him , but I will check it out !
---
Old School Runescape wasn't Runescape 2.0, but they developed new content for it while also developing content for regular Runescape.
---
Well... reporting bugs is literally the whole point of a beta... it's not intended to be a sneak peak of the game.
---
This clip also gives me the smug satisfaction after everyone said over and over on this sub that dungeons are trivial, and you don't need to be tank specced to tank or heal specced to heal and you don't need to be at or higher level than the dungeon to do them.  
---
Like yeah this guy is a moron, but this shit is still not trivial.
---
Thats not what i am saying if you read it... Im saying its a slippery slope
---
Double post, but more relevant here:

When I started in Vanilla, one of my buddies from Ventrilo rolled a lock. His Imp's name was, 'Pagmat'. I was way into the level 30s before I realized this was just a random name for his pets. I would be in dungeons, asking to locks to pull out their 'Pagmats' for the HP buff.

Now I know you're the real deal because that's the most boomer-ific meme I've ever fucking seen lmfao

They're just frustrating because you get overwhelmed so quickly, and then the foragers fucking potion at like 40% hp, and you probably won't have a way to interrupt it. I usually play that area safe and stay the fuck away from the center of the camps.

Diagnostics are likely to get automated, but not nursing as much. There is a really amazing book/audiobook on the subject, "What to do when machines do everything." I highly recommend it for anyone getting into the work force or making a pivot in their career. Automation is going to start happening rapidly. It sounds like you are very woke to this idea so I thought I'd share. :)
---
Lol. Im not in high school this time around. After I put all of that energy into WOW I turned around and used that same fervor becoming an engineer. Now I have a professional job and a family. I don‚Äôt have the option of letting it become an addiction this time around.

See, the problem is that in 9 out off 10, women are the part of the relationship that seems to have problems with giving "partners free time".

You should consider why it is that way. I give you a hint. Women like to controll men, cause they genetically still programmed to rely on them (caring for babies). Get over your girl friends biology.

Tanks not using shield block is triggering me a little..... not sure why.
---
They said it was based on several factors, including sub time. Based on the size of the beta so far, it's also a healthy dose of RNG. Yeah, some streamers got to jump the line, but it's definitely not streamers only.
---
There aren't that many great one handed swords for mages
---
&gt;  just go to another layer   
---
&gt; empty ungoro layer 
---
u dont seem to know how layering works, thanks for posting though :)
---
I will be rolling druid because I love the lore, theme, and play style of the class the most. Being able to off heal with high mobility are my favorite things about druid, I also love the varied play style of using all of your forums in pvp. Plus stealth is super handy of pvp servers.
---
 No thanks. Have been using a modified 1.12 client for a while now to fix the FOV issue. Makes the game much more enjoyable for me.
---
Posers get hose-rd...
---
^^^^^^^^^^GetRekt!
---
Ohh yea I‚Äôve watched Mad Season a few times . I like him so far . I‚Äôll check the other 2 out , thanks ! 
---
And with Tips maybe I‚Äôm wrong , but it seems he talks more about things he‚Äôs researched than actually played ? Just overall seems a little corny and not entertaining for my taste , but might be great for someone
---
Warrior always felt like this.
---
"I should have enough health to finish this mob off"
---
\*misses swing\*
---
It only automatically tracks new quests added to the log after enabled in vanilla, if I recall correctly. Is it not doing that?
---
Maybe they're in college or Uni? Or played when they were like....3-4
---
Same 15 bucks though.
---
We have 1-60 leveling videos from Joana, thats a lot of hours of vanilla gameplay. Stop acting like feedback cannot be correct simply because private servers were a thing.
---
You misread mine. BFA is a great game and the people that two crap about it either are too poor to play or want to be miserable. This outage clickbait culture we live in is annoying alt-right people like you and alexsensual are horrible for our game and hating on something you don‚Äôt play is just a miserable waste of time.
---
Have you even looked at how layering even works? I'll answer the question for you, because it's obvious. No, no you haven't.
---
Check out the video Faster Horses on YouTube. It's enlightening.
---
Aren‚Äôt the only doing it for a couple weeks?
---
This really is the true face of Classic WoW.
---
And I love it.
---
You can easily hop to another layer simply by grouping up with another friend on that layer.
---
[With the LFD addon everyone is using, it will be easier then ever](https://imgur.com/4Z0RpId)
---
Remember, this is a beta... bugs are expected. Not laziness, it's simply a matter of testing and bugfixing, an integral part of the software development process. The "lazy" thing would be to not do any testing or bugfixing.
---
both those things are gameplay
---
the point is if a few little things are changed yeah whatever but if fuckloads of little stuff is different it wont feel anything like vanilla
---
people are so defensive about little changes or differences not mattering
---
i think a lot of little changes could change the feel of the game
---
It could also possibly be because they are both tauren.  The hit box on this would be cut in half, making it way smaller but still big compared to others.
---
Same here. I'm coming back in solely for PvP since I mostly focused on PvE way back when.
---
whats with this endgame spoilers?
---
Anyone that got at least 2500exp in retail at one point. Some streamers (like the Classicast, Swifty, Defcamp etc.) might be knowledgeable, but their skill and game IQ is very low.
---
I'd rather watch a good player with less knowledge (they will catch up really fast anyways).
---
During the old betas, did you play and submit feedback?
---
Hey guys, so Classic release is imminent and the beta's happening now. This has let me see some of the Classic classes in action.
---
At first I believed I'd main a Paladin, but now I'm not sure. I still love their aesthetic, being support heavy, and having that role versatility depending on the content (Dungeons/Raids/PvP).
---
But now, idk, something about seeing Mages and Warlocks slinging spells looks really cool! Being a caster looks dope.
---
Mages have so much utility, the idea of being a glass cannon with a lot of tools for keep-away is intriguing.
---
Warlocks have a special place in my heart for being dark casters and I like the complexity that comes with managing dots/debuffs/pets.
---
Both these casters are less support but still offer great utility compared to the Paladin.
---
I know it takes a lot of investment to get a character up to lvl 60, which is why I'm not sure which class to prioritize?
---
I'd definitely like to give a go at all 3 eventually at cap. But it's hard to narrow it down further than these 3 before getting a hands-on myself.
---
So what do you guys suggest? Leave your advice and reasons for why you'd start for one or the other two that'll hopefully help me make a decision before release :D
---
Have the pure vanilla experience but what about in a year or more? What happens next and I think polls need to be added to determine it's future.
---
Be prepared to deal with "retail kiddies" and take time to teach them the differences and how to play. I'm worried people are just going to en-masse insult nooby players like a bunch of elitist pricks.
---
Because there's going to be thousands and thousands of people that don't know what they're doing.
---
Ion Hazzikostas said they're not doing layering at the point of world boss release due to spawning on different layers. It's just a way to handle the initial load of release. Calm down.
---
What‚Äôs the character sheet like for caster stats? The original one in vanilla was pretty broken if I remember correctly.
---
Oh wow, a dungeon run where the tank and healer are trash, and it actually matters!
---
We are indeed back, boys!
---
Everyone needs to calm down, the beta invites aren't even finished going out yet, and this is only the first wave. Each day more and more invites will go out. if you didn't get one today, keep checking your launcher daily and you'll probably eventually get in during the next couple weeks.
---
You might get lucky and get Rofl'zor.
---
yea going to be a tough call on going war or not, will depend on guild i guess, already did leveling as warrior once... TT
---
I am not streaming yet because of deployment, but I will be when I get home. A more casual approach is what I will be doing hopefully with friends and fans. Check out my small YouTube channel, Icosiol, and I will announce there and Twitter when I begin streaming.
---
MrGM is defintely my favourite
---
immune to crushing blows?
---
how about you let people make any claim they want and have blizzard access it as bug report and determine what is correct?
---
Sounds probable!
---
ungoro's empty on layer 5 because horde are raiding darnassus
---
doesnt matter where the friend is? wrong.  
---
will there ever be an empty ungoro layer except the first 2 days? nope.
---
Another Triggered. hehe hi
---
I think the argument for streamers is that they have more followers for a Pr perspective, not that they have any real insight into playing the game.  
---
They are likely average WoW vanilla players at best, just broadcasting their embarrasing mediocrity to the world.
---
And as sad as it is some get viewers by being shitty at games.  Dunno why blizzard games attract that but this kind of behavior but a lot of the streamers seem like they can be morons at times.
---
The ramifications it has on world pvp are pretty severe tbh. Breaks immersion when you see people disappear into thin air
---
I‚Äôm using classic as a way to experience wow for the first time again.
---
I always played the horde and never experienced what the alliance went through.... so alliance I‚Äôm here to help.
---
Always pick a support character, Whether a priest or a tank, to help my guild... so mage let‚Äôs get dps‚Äôing in here.
---
Well I am sure glad you did, because this is solid gold.
---
wishful thinking, they'll prioritize layers over opening new realms since they can remove layers later but can't really merge realms
---
I'm in, I know no one, I'm not a streamer, nor friends and family. I've been playing since '04, but with large gaps in between years. 
---
Everyone I was playing with last night was also not a streamer (From the impromptu straw poll some dude took) about 15 people.
---
He literally equipped everything he needed for the int/spirit bonuses since he got funneled onto healer.. but nice try I guess.
---
He hits decently even on a level 60 character lol
---
they have said it wont be around after phase 
---
i think there will be group finder addons that make it easy to exploit this functionality because as you say you can control what layer you are on.
---
they wont change it , they want less servers because they think the player base will drop the fuck off after a while (which it may).
---
if we are lucky they may put some limit on how often you can change layer
---
In combat? You can't unequip non-weapon slot items while in combat.
---
Thou shall not doubt the infallible Blizzard! all is truth!
---
Only way this conversation ever happened
---
How do you know what layer he is in? Hoe do you know what layer you are in? How do you move between layers once you've jumped to the same layer?
---
Emotional, over a videogame, lol.
---
Yes and i've seen 20+ posts of people saying the regen is very similar to his videos.
---
Everybody knew there will be some kind of sharding for a while, guess sometimes we have to deal with it. If blizzard don't keep on their word to remove it after Phase 1, then feel free to craft a pitch fork for me as well.
---
I didn't play til MoP. I still want to try classic warrior so I can hate myself.
---
Its going to take forever to get Jakqua, i bet :(
---
I remember some patch a year or two after i started playing (maybe the cata prepatch?) fucked up warlock pet names.  I was so incredibly sad to have some random, worthless imp.
---
It actually kind of surprised me, because i normally dont get attached to things like that in games.  I have no idea why, but despite punting that little fucker around all the time im really attached to him.
---
Yup, always have and always will if included
---
You think that one of the first things they would test is melee range
---
Tips sounds really truly hard reading  forums and believes to be an expert using private server as factual data , I really hate when people use private servers at factual data for anything ...
---
I mean, you can start with the drama between him and Asmongold before BfA release. Every single one of his streams was bitching about Classic and how people are going to hate it. Then he had to calm down a little bit because he saw how huge Classic playerbase is, but you can literally just go through his reddit account to see the hatred he has towards Classic.
---
why would that be lame? thats the only way it would be fair otherwise everyone would play hunter as tauren.
---
If you dont have your healer on the cannon you are doing VC wrong tho
---
Is anyone claiming it has no downsides?
---
Tell your wife that she deserves a day of relaxation. If you can afford it, give her a day at a spa/something she likes and you will have enough good boy points to play WoW.
---
Why the hate. This video may have nostalgia value, it may be fun and entertaining, but it's simply not accurate to say this is the best PvP video ever. It's not.
---
I am in the beta. Not a streamer or a friend of one at all. The servers were very empty last night. I didn't have to fight over quest mobs or item spawns a single time playing last night in the undead zone. There is no way this is all the invites they are sending out. To echo the other comments, I am sure more will be sent out.
---
I hope not, waste of someone's time verifying something pike that when they could be working on something else
---
Loot distribution. Fear is an alright cc, banish sometimes, summoning. You rarely AOE in 5 mans anyway.
---
Totally agree, we‚Äôre not hating on vanilla, just simply stating that it‚Äôs not necessarily harder than bfa.
---
It's not a collectors edition for classic, it's the 15 year anniversary edition.
---
I'm actually glad I played a bit on pservers, just for a reality check on the more cynical parts of vanilla like devilsaur mafias and the state of BGs/ranking, and also getting a feel for just how fast the poopsockers level and progress.
---
A lot of people like the guy you're replying to are going to have their illusions thoroughly shattered.
---
If they 8 yo in 2004 they 23 in 2019, doesn't sound like a reach
---
If fire balls to the face is what you're craving I can help you out.
---
You guys complain way to fucking much.
---
we have to wait and see to which extent we can comfortably control layers. also if u doubt for a single second that wow classic isnt loosing half its week1 players by week5 youre kinda off imo.
---
Or warrior, right ? Or are we all just gonna forget feral has two roles?
---
So you are saying a frech lvl 60 warlock is good in dungeons in case someone leaves?
---
Almost was me, I had the choice between Wow and Dofus but I chose Dofus cause I was a broke boy
---
Imagine caring enough about items in a beta that you make this thread
---
&gt; Tips reported a bug on the boss because it did too much dmg.
---
....I don't think low level 5man bosses are supposed to smack a warrior for 60% of his health in a single hit.
---
Yes, because if a warlock happens to message you first when you're looking for dps, instead of being a tryhard dork you could just invite them and have fun playing the damn game.
---
I‚Äôm one of them
---
Pretty sure he's referring to a highschool education, not college. Otherwise the joke wouldn't really make sense.
---
I'm just glad I won't get denied guild invites because I'm 12. That and people asking me "if my balls have dropped". 
---
Gonna take some sweet VC time and no life it while getting paid. Truly the dream.
---
How kind of you to offer your face as tribute, fair mad'am.
---
To be fair. At the age of 18 which is the oldest possible age to still be in school, they would‚Äôve been 5, which (while way too young to probably get anything out of it and probably doesn‚Äôt really count as playing), they could truthfully say that they were playing wow in classic.
---
No problem :D I only knew because I had an email from amazon. I knew lots of people wanted them so glad I could help :D
---
what is the sign? that you didnt get invited to beta because you didnt have a sub like was required?
---
‚ÄúUnefficient‚Äù are the types of people who don‚Äôt understand someone who is generally negative with no stake in something will do a lesser job than someone who is positive and invested.
---
It‚Äôs not a fucking argument lol.
---
Then why would it be posted here?
---
You are arguably getting less in this CE than those for past content, as there is no box cost for a normal sub to classic that a prior CE would have included.
---
Doesn't it increase your chance to block, not make the next attack 100% blocked?
---
Only the huge streamers will have any real effect on servers, but even then you're over exaggerating the impact. Just play the game, have fun and enjoy classic.
---
&gt; you are against it just because you don't like it
---
OMG NO CHANGES /RAGEQUIT
---
I watched his video last night where he was playing the Beta and a few times he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if it was this way on classic or not ‚Äú .....then why are you making a video as if you‚Äôre an expert . I guess because people keep watching therefore he keeps getting paid.
---
To be fair, you absolutely do not need to be tank specced to tank, nor do the healers need to be healing specced. However, if you play like a fucking dipshit like we see both the tank and healer do in the video, then you're going to have a bad time.
---
I played priest in vanilla and I intend to heal in classic too so either priest or shaman.
---
If people don't quit, then the logical solution is to split layers into realms. The goal of layering is to not wind up with dead realms and then have to realm mergers down the line.
---
This man SIP traces
---
i believe it just needed the slow fall from noggenfroger
---
they much later nerfed the duration of the slow fall
---
there are videos the first time it was amazing you like jump off a sort of shrine area and float for ages into hyjal , one of the first things ill do when i can
---
Could this be updated to include the class/race? :)
---
True, except your Hunter implies Nelf. Non-nelf hunters don't name themselves Legolas.
---
We whined on the forums.
---
I think all dungeon bosses hit hard AF.  Except maybe ragefire, but even then.
---
The hydra from BFD hits super hard.  
---
Arugal is tough as hell.  
---
The krone from rfk is one of the easier bosses, and still puts out high dps with fast attacks.
---
Stockades, RFD etc.
---
#TAUREN MELEE RANGE RACIAL CONFIRMED BOIS
---
It's not strictly a Classic CE. It's just a WoW 15th Anniversary set that comes with a month of sub for the whole game. Classic ain't mentioned anywhere on it, hell it even comes with retail mounts, was just a good time to release the info.
---
That said, the other CEs didn't have a 10+ inch statue making up the bulk of the value. I hope to god that thing's worth it...
---
Because they are who messaged you and it literally doesn't matter what you bring for DPS. 
---
I feel like people in this sub really don't understand how easy it is to get into groups in vanilla WoW.
---
Tank is wearing broken gear, incorrectly fighting a boss known to hit like a train, and everyone is playing like garbage. Problem in definitely in chair, not in game.
---
indeed, but they need to remove layering at some point, so they cant just load 10 layers with 3k pop each on one server. my rough estimate would be that around 60% of the first time players quit after a week or two. so that means 12k people may come out as a stable \~5k population, which is already too much for one server afaik
---
I know right? we must put our faith and trust in the same devs and company that completely ruined Warcraft to begin with! 
---
Send blizzard more money bros, maybe we can persuade Ion to let us be on his "layer"!
---
People talked about this a long time ago and would get downvoted into oblivion because of his fanboys but i'll say it again.
---
He is awful at the game, worse than awful. He never played during vanilla retail ( **Don't get me started on gate keeping everyone is entitled to make content as long as you know what you're talking about** ) When he started making Content the highest character he ever had was 33 on a private server that was known for having incorrect values on spells and really bad pathing among other things.
---
He repeats what everyone else says; You watch his videos where he interviews "well known" players to pass it off as his own knowledge, there was one about warriors which he had absolutely no idea how to play a warrior, when that is what he considers " His main ".
---
Someone makes a video on why BRD is the best dungeon ever in vanilla, 2 days later he has a video on why he loved BRD ( something that he never did in Vanilla ) and how it was the greatest instance ever.
---
you also forgot during his PoV clip:
---
* Charges in and turns his back to the mob instead of strafing 
---
* No Shield block learnt / On his bars
---
* No rejuv/regrowth on the tank
---
* Gets crit for 405 Damage
---
Look don't get me wrong who ever that loser is healing, shouldn't be playing also : 
---
* Casting Wrath when the tank is at 50% 
---
* Followed by a moon Fire right after wrath
---
* Running around in circles instead of healing the warrior that picked it up after the rogue
---
Though i will admit this you can see how badly they fucked up with their " attempt " to recreate Spell batching If you look at roughly 35 seconds in the main clip from the healers PoV he casts Regrowth it effects the player for Half a second ( **You can see the buff applied to the Warrior** ) then the flat healing takes effect. 
---
Esfand mentioned this in one of his videos from the test they had last week at Blizzard where he mentions he would cast judgement then half a second to a second later the damage would go off.
---
I know you have an opinion but you can be level headed and see my point of view as well, you were just coming off as a bit stubborn. I can agree that leveling could be difficult if you‚Äôre new to the game or just not very good at it.
---
Was a Pally when I first played retail classic. Did Hunter and Lock on PServers. Think I will go with a Priest this time around to change things up.
---
lol yeah classic
---
i think my one had a good name but i forget what it was
---
That‚Äôs a Tauren swinging at a Tauren., which is uncommon outside of duels. They both have wide hit ranges. That looks like a range I remember.
---
That being said. I‚Äôm fairly certain they tested it with an orc and were still hitting him from about that far away. Which looks a little too long if that‚Äôs the case. We will need a fixed camera angel and fixed FOV to really tell. How long it actually is
---
Until yesterday, I forgot about my Tauren Paladin named Milknheals. I laughed longer than I should have at that.
---
Guess I didn't have enough room for the din.
---
were you around at WoW launch? if so. Then you would understand why they doing what they doing.
---
[http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft](http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft)
---
&gt;At launch, things took a turn for the bizarre. Blizzard‚Äôs forecasts for the game were dead wrong, the swell of players flooding servers was too much for them to handle. Stores were selling out of the game fast and online vendors were taking orders left and right. When they flipped the servers on, the little light flicked from ‚Äúon‚Äù to ‚Äúburning on fire please help‚Äù as server queues reached the 1000s. The servers were crashing harder than burning ship trying to walk into Mordor.If you got past the queues, you were greeted with latency issues, including the infamous ‚Äúkneel and loot stuff for half an hour‚Äù and the even more infamous ‚Äúdisconnect because Internet was really sketchy back then compared to now‚Äù and be greeted by the 1,000 person queue. Blizzard issued game time credits for lost playtime and the rocky ride lasted over a month. Afterward, the servers were plagued with dilapidated hardware that wasn‚Äôt optimized to run the game and the entire issue wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúperfected‚Äù until all the servers were upgraded.
---
Your clearly a glass is half empty type of person and just sound like a big baby whiner. Its 2019 not 2004 anymore. To think your going to get the exact same experience and launch as the original your crazy. Everyone already knows everything about classic wow.  Even if blizzard released everything EXACTLY how it was in 2004, it wont even be close to the same experience or game its impossible. Unless you know how to collectively wipe everyones memory of WoW classic. Once you realize this, sharding/layering and the "changes" they are making are for the better of the community and the launch of the game. I am glad you are not part of the Dev team or we would be playing a DOA game at launch.
---
Actually it was 94' for me. Some may call it gating but if you started in 04' you're also late to the party. WORLD of Warcraft is simply the evolution of Warcraft.
---
Ofcourse, since I don't have a beta invite I solely rely on streamers doing /who though.
---
Quick the tanks dying....moonfire and wrath haha
---
And old vanilla players didnt bother because was a DEMO and not the BETA
---
While the BETA is out and guess what? PRIVATE LEECHES were going ham for the REGEN HP that has already been proven to be = like it was in 2004.  
---
So lets say that PS crowd need to be not trusted asap? ok.
---
how is one supposed to "play better" to avoid being hit for 60% of max health? please explain
---
That was only rank 1 moonfire
---
Great newb story!  We've all got those.
---
Mine was being a hunter, not knowing what "threat" was (based on previous games like Diablo or KOTOR I assumed it was critical strike chance, and it wasn't worth it), I thought I was brilliant for using Concussive Shot to get an extra auto-shot in before melee.
---
Mind blown #1: you can have your pet tank so you can get infinite auto-shots.
---
Mind blown #2: you can kite.
---
Now I regret my decision to try alliance this time thanks.... haha
---
on the Horde side:  
---
"Rexxar, is Misha's growl turned on?"  
---
"Naw, man. She's cool"  
---
"Dude Misha keeps pulling threat."  
---
"Well gee, Cairne, maybe if you actually equipped tanking gear then this wouldn't be an issue."  
---
"Don't you blame my tanking for your pet... Thrall why don't you have Tranquil Air Totem up on the DPS?"  
---
"Cause WF is dope, dude."  
---
"Yeah but I can't keep threat!"
---
Prob cause I said it looks like a biy with it tits lol
---
Nice fireball shooting at Rag.
---
Well played sir.
---
Almost exactly the same here lol. I graduated highschool 10 years ago and didn't do college right away. However, I started 4 years ago and just got my Bachelor's last week :P
---
They don't?  Oops.
---
Watch Esfand, he's legitimately good. Great wholesome personality that's easy to watch unlike other streamers who's target audience is people with the attention span of a 6 year old.
---
You are min/maxing 5 man's?
---
It means a lot of things.  Like as a caster its harder to get out of melee range of a tauren. But as a melee user, you can hit taurens from farther away.
---
Double edged sword, but it can be played into many classes advantages.  It also screws with hunter dead zone ranges as they need to space differently which situational but can be a huge advantage for the tauren.
---
Please explain how I am gate keeping? Did I say they can‚Äôt play? Did I make you feel bad for not playing back in 04? Do you feel slighted? Did I ever say that you had to play back then to play now?
---
\&gt;this is the best representative classic community could muster up
---
Bartender? One yike, please. Put it on my tab.
---
I am used to being called all kinds of words when I tell people that I met my wife through WoW and that we have a beautiful daughter now just because of this stupid game for nerds. No one really understands. Oh well, just fcuk 'em! It's most certainly  their loss, not mine.
---
Yeah I distinctly remember either having a hunter kite it for part of the fight and often having a dps die when pulling aggro.
---
But we still managed to do it even when people were much worse back then with worse computers and bad internet because they followed basic mechanics and took it seriously.
---
well said, his sarcasm whiny character is why this sub has such a bad rep :D
---
Having your gear in good condition makes you take less damage.
---
yeah there should be massive drop off when people see how slow it is
---
but i also think a hell of a lot of people will start day 
---
like its a blizard product and there are not a lot of other good mmo's out there
---
i think blizz would just rather have less servers with layers than make more servers and provide free transfers like vanilla 
---
question is what hapens if 1 popular server has too many people for a single layer?
---
whatever server streamers are on could litterally have too many players for them ever to disable layering completely
---
Obviously a jab at people complaining that the game comes out when they have to go back to class. Well, classes are not just in schools, they are also in colleges and universities and those have people in them of all different ages.
---
In my case, I‚Äôm in neither, but I‚Äôm complaining because I wanted to play with my cousin and my friend - my cousin is still in school, so he won‚Äôt be able to play with me now because he has to go back to school, and my friend is in pharmacy school - a very work intensive education - so he likely won‚Äôt be able to play much with me either.
---
Its a lot easier once your behind to say, wasent trying anyway
---
Anyone who has done this in vanilla will remember that this guy hits like a truck. That was my thought as I watched his stream just before the pull.
---
Imagine giving a level-headed reply to a 45 yr old mad neet on reddit. Respect yourself bro
---
No one would really have improved shield block at this stage, you'd have to put basically all points into Prot which is pretty much universally agreed to be a bad leveling spec.
---
maybe because they want to run a dungeon?
---
You dont remember warriors pulling with axes?
---
Not have broken items and have the right abilities up?
---
I'm going to make the assumption it'll port you out similar to how it did in WoTLK. There was a work around but that required bugging the client using a vehicle mount.
---
It looks like there is no reputation split i.e. you get some reputation with all horde races after each quest. I don't remember that being a thing in vanilla but I have seen some comments about it.
---
Also what's the maximum video resolution you can set and is you native resolution (desktop) higher than 1080p?
---
Nixxiom and esfand would bro out so hard.
---
Can anyone confirm if the /sit macro still procs enrage for Fury Warriors?
---
Right, so take your experience with that ret pala as proof that weirdos that want to min max everything and tell you most specs aren't viable are simply full of shit
---
at least we get some gametime with it + a real good looking figurine. just take a look at the last ce. bfa collectors edition did not have game time. you got a book, a big flip/coin to put somewhere on display and (which frankly does not look that great)... AND.... an envelope... containing two codes, one for bfa and one for the soundtrack to download. that was such a disgrace, id call it an insult even. the new ce is also not that great, lacks some making of content, best of 15 years music etc. but the figure looks better than the last one so that makes up a bit for that
---
Rogue (Dagger) OH is a BoE low chance drop. Any chance you can swap that to something... "obtainable by the average player"?
---
One group wipes in wc and this means all private server players would wipe there
---
Got it
---
As someone who heavily exploited shard jumping for years, I completely agree. It will be exploited. But the opinion is getting shot down at every turn on this sub. Not a deal breaker for me but it will absolutely change the feel when I can grab a layer hopping addon, join a random group from a different layer to get my boss kill and hop back
---
This is the actual answer.
---
Fair enough. A slider on which the default option is the Wotlk fov would be great but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see that.
---
You act like there's mythic plus in classic.
---
Well that's not possible anymore so let's just shut it all down lol
---
They should cancel this guy's beta...
---
They all have the same /played. It came out at 4:45 pm CST  yesterday so you can do the math
---
Thank you, glad somebody isn‚Äôt a blind fanboy.  Kind of disappointed my rather nonaggressive response has been downvoted as it has.  Oh well, can‚Äôt compete with Twitch, I suppose.
---
Ion specifically said they CAN'T have it on when they turn on world bosses. Can't you at least save your pitchfork for when and if they backtrack on that?
---
It doesn‚Äôt.
---
Warrior becomes considerably faster at 30 with sweeping strikes and r2 cleave.
---
I did the same thing. Stay strong.
---
I may or may not rewatch it now
---
&gt;Blizzard please make more 15th anniversary CE's and don't make me buy one on e-bay for 3x the price. 
---
No one is making you do anything.
---
Yea. I‚Äôm in the same boat. Instead of being in high school I‚Äôm an engineer with a family this go around. I loved AQ so much. Both the 20 and 40 man raids. C‚Äôthun was a blast once we downed him. I remember being an armor whore. Even when it was obsolete I kept my T1/2/2.5/3 in the bank. I did that will all of my armor sets. My wife has never played an MMO but says she will give it a go with me. She‚Äôs an engineer also. We met in school. 
---
I‚Äôm pumped about this.
---
Holy crap, I was defending him just yesterday.  I feel like a total tool.  I even commented him directly and said a ton of people like his videos and to ignore the hate.  Jesus what an ignorant thing to do.
---
People who dont support Blizzard don't deserve to get in the beta
---
are you trolling or are you sincerely on this level? lmao
---
The damage values are very likely correct. The tank was missing 2 items (broken gear), didnt use defensive abilities, and was out of heal range.
---
They wiped and tried it again without issue. 
---
I am sorry, but I downvoted you because you are incorrect.
---
Naa, the mana cost it negligable ecpecially for locks, you have life tap.
---
did lock pet names get changed ?
---
man that sucks i stopped playing lock after bc but i would have been cut
---
this same vid was def during TBC, it caused a huge forum post on arenajunkies at the time.
---
[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpcmpr/the_classic_5_man_dungeon_experience/enrhswr/) is a way better breakdown than I would be able to provide. 
---
The biggest ones though are no demo shout, no shield block, and two pieces of broken gear. 
---
I'd like to add also that their group composition is fucking stupid.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre serious or not.
---
haha thanks. But i dont think he deserves that much credit. You dont get that whiny all on your own.
---
Druids aren't that great at soaking until Dire Bear Form either...
---
&gt; How can you say layering will not effect player saturation?? 
---
 Because in my mind the alternative is just rolling with an original 3k server, not a 6k server. There is no difference between a 3k layer and a 3k server
---
Lol, no. If you want to be Legolas, why would you be a dwarf? Or a tauren or orc?
---
Not a criticism, btw, cause I think it's true! I'm sure Nelfs are disproportionate among hunters for just this reason of wanting to be Legolas.
---
yea robin williams and anthony bourdain really lacked perspective and creativity. lol dude.
---
Well, there has already been talks on this sub about armor not being the same for bosses in Vanilla as they are on private servers. Vanilla never baselined armor ratings, so each boss had it‚Äôs armor rating, and this might be why some players on pservers barrel through content.
---
I dislike the new water, and it seems to give a small advantage when used, that's an issue if you ask me.
---
Otherwise I love the clearer image, the increase in foliage, looks sweet.
---
I would be more than happy with a fov slider, like the one in Guild Wars 2. And yeah I really hope they work more on the lighting, glad they‚Äôve changed this type of stuff since blizzcon.
---
My god thats a beautiful green man
---
Its easy in empty server, going to be slower at release with full server and with the ganking.
---
Not sure if it was that extreme, but I do remember as an alliance player seeing a few horde videos from back in the day and noticing tauren warriors standing miles away and attacking.
---
Curse vs Firemaw is one that springs to mind (as an acquaintance of mine *was* said warrior), I very briefly tried looking for it but couldn't find it &gt;_&lt;
---
I think they updated the API to BFA's from what i've been hearing
---
Outrage is all the rage.
---
They reverted it back within a couple days.  It was an accidental thing.
---
Oops, forgot to expand on that in my original post.
---
Everyone is a healer lol
---
Graduated HS in '01.  Graduated College in '19.  Several years of life/service in between.  Two years of school left to go - should finish in '22.
---
These numbers need to stop.  Bro, I thought 2000 was like the top end.  Why? :PepeHands:
---
It was announced lol.
---
Put it into perspective. 3 months isn‚Äôt far away
---
No, this is the shittiest, least explanitory sequence diagram I've ever seen.
---
If the community is so fragile that layering will kill Classic before the end of Phase 1, then it deserves to die.
---
Assuming nobody took breaks or slept. Also don‚Äôt tell me what I can and can‚Äôt math, you don‚Äôt know my abilities lol.
---
Madseason is the equivalent of a nice slow paced BBC documentary. Just show me the stuff and narrate a little. 
---
Some of these other creators are like Alex Jones, yelling and screaming about things they know nothing about.
---
If I'm playing alliance there are two options.  Dwarves use guns.  As much as I like guns in real life, I don't like them in WoW.  So I play Night Elf.
---
Step 1: Reduce the #nochanges group to its most extreme 3 members, or failing that, just make up arguments for them.
---
Step 2: Once you have your bit that nobody is complaining about, shout from the rooftops about how everyone needs to stop complaining about it. Repeat with as many obviously good changes as you can, regardless of how nobody is bitching about them (colorblind mode, moving characters in selection menu, graphics updates etc).
---
Step 3: Make sure you characterize these fictional complainers as sweaty cheeto-dust nerds, and expand that to #nochanges as a whole. *This is very important.*
---
Step 4: Ride the new wave of people who are interested in trying out Classic "to see what vanilla is like," and rapidly outnumber the people who have been fighting for this for years.
---
Step 5: Now that you have those sweaty nerds outnumbered, continue to push the narrative that they are awful nerds who shouldn't be liked, and tie that perception to the #nochanges community.
---
Step 6: Extend previous arguments to changes that "only barely" effect gameplay "for like only 1% of the population." Make sure to emphasize that the only people who are against your opinions are sWeAtY NeRds. 
---
Step 7: Gradually push for more changes because "I have a job and a family and no time to play WoW I'm too busy having a life not like those SweatyNerds^TM who can *grind all day* seriously they disgust me. This game should cater more towards people who don't have time to play it.
---
Step 8: Shit all over my dreams, like you did with retail. 
---
Or maybe I'm just being dramatic, idk.
---
Almost 33 (looking Like 23, but whatever), degree as dental hygienist, worked some years and decided to try once more the test to study dentistry (quite hard one here were i live) . Passed it at age 29, and working/studying atm, also dealt and dealing with depression.
---
Life can be shit but you are never alone out there.
---
I assume that the priority right now is to get basic systems checked and functioning. End game content can always be patched after release and it will take players some time to get to it.
---
Has anyone tested any addons on the beta yet? Is there a website that has some in development? Is Blizzard even allowing addons on beta?
---
Man ,why are you so aggressive? I am just asking questions here. oO
---
Big summonz
---
This is dumb and a non issue. Just set it at whatever you want.
---
Communicate with your healer so he is ready and can heal you up before the next swing since the swing timers on this particular boss is very long. Use Shield Block so you can't get crushed and heavily reduce the damage this boss can do.
---
wah?
---
I guess that is fair they are not making me, but this is not like Blizzcon where there is a limited number of seats for people... they could easily just produce more of these.
---
Okay thanks, looks like I‚Äôll be leveling Arms!
---
i'd like to get a /played when we find them at 30. I ever get a Beta invite I plan on actually leveling a Warlock just to show that these players running around with the Blueberry are doing it wrong.
---
1.12 was a good spot for leveling and using the IMP up to Succy was the fastest/ It was easy doing a type of Fear killing and putting the Imp on Passive but macroing them to attack. They would break the Fear normally so you didn't get adds most of the time but also kept them off of you so you could chain pull/kill effectively.
---
It‚Äôs a joke that people have felt the need to tell me how they started playing when they were 5 as if I gave a shit about their story. Or how they went to college later on in life because of something. It‚Äôs a jab at all the kids on this subreddit who talk about they played back in 04 yet their in high school. What it‚Äôs become is every 30 year old saying that ‚Äúcollege isn‚Äôt just for kids under 24‚Äù. This is not slight to you just the one I commented on.
---
I dont really care what would be the most accurate recreation. I watched a few minutes of Preach questing in Mulgore and that loved how the game looks.
---
We still are, just in smaller numbers.
---
I didn‚Äôt pay attention! Cater to me so I don‚Äôt have to admit it was my fault üôÅ
---
meirl.
---
I actually loaded up bnet on a flash drive at work just so i can check here and there, which is pointless since its not like ill be downloading/installing it here.
---
They kinda make the game, at least insofar as they impact style.  I know I have a preference between SMB 1985 and SMB All-Stars 1993.
---
Definitely prefer Mad Season over the likes of Tips and that asshat Esfand
---
Yep I'm in the same boat my friend.
---
It's a geoup effort. They didn't say anything and just went with the flow.
---
imagine thinking ff14 is worthy of an "Oooof"
---
Doing an asshole thing when it doesn't matter is worse than when it does in my opinion.  Kicking someone when you will never see them again is way worst than doing it to someone you know.  Obviously assault isn't comparable to doing something like deleting an item, but I try to do the right thing even when it doesn't matter.  I would never delete an item I needed on, even when I have done betas before.
---
New textures for the world, old city layouts and shit, old models.
---
Thanks for posting, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have any info about whats going on!
---
no they dont?  if layering works and the game is popular enough to need it, there's no reason to remove it
---
It's not a Classic Edition. it was just the 15 year edition.
---
Because the voice you used in your head to read my comment sounded aggressive. I'm just telling you this min max nonsense and trying to scope people's class and spec before inviting them to a 5 man is playing the game wrong and isn't going to be fun
---
Does Tauren Hunter's Deadzone have different distances then too?
---
Did they mention how they're doing the waves on invites? Daily or weekly?
---
Has anyone got an new invite today?
---
Had a go making my own, thanks for inspiring me it's also my first one.

Druid. Versatility in PvP seems like way more fun to me. 
---
Probably roll a Priest as my alternate just for Mind Controlling people into lava
---
Oh my goodness thank you so much for this brilliant post I can't express enough how happy this makes me. These are the emotions that drive the recreation of this game and it's community back then and hopefully again. 
---
The level of mystic this game had will never be truly relived because of obvious reasons (we arn't all 15 year olds with 12 hours + a day and no social lives and we've been introduced to much higher graphic technological improvements). But I hope with enough players like this that throw a little more passion (rather than just number crunching spreadsheet raiders) we can have another deeply connected , unique experience! 
---
It is impressive you stuck with it.  That experience you described with the lvl 40 friends is a real thing and it totally sucks and can definitely ruin the excitement of playing this game. 
---
P.s
---
I can't believe Taurens sold this game to you (though I'm glad it did).. like..whew ...my least favorite race next to gnomes. They are so goofy!
---
When he deleted a cloak after needing it, then just acted the asshole in the WC streaming run, I lost a lot of respect for the guy.
---
I'm glad they are catering to colorblind people :)
---
Nope.  Have to open log after picking up quests and shift click the new ones.
---
its all about server identity and mergability (is this even a word?) a few weeks in.
---
They cant load up several server sizes on one server and expect layering to be gone in a few weeks (they gotta have a rough estimate on how much % of players will remain after initial hype, my guess is around 25-40%)
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
My Barrens is ready!
---
Thanks for sharing, looks really good.
---
That healer is Soda rofl. I can't stand Tips either but you can't seriously say Soda is bad, he wasn't taking the run seriously at all.
---
So far it seems like most of the invites have been literally day 1 players, which is pretty wild. Hopefully you get in the next wave :)
---
I started 1 month after launch so I'm cautiously optimistic.
---
Good one dude, see you at lvl 30 at 50 hours played.
---
Were you subscribed when you got beta access?
---
Still trying to figure out if it's a requirement to be subbed to be chosen for beta.
---
Depending on time you could have been on a new layer. I will say in Northshire I never did any quest that I wasn‚Äôt fighting over mobs with less than 10-15 other people. I played till level 9 before I had to go to bed. I don‚Äôt remember any time while I was playing that I was alone.
---
Except watching this fight that damage looks pretty consistent, the only issue is the actual gameplay. If soda would just heal normally then they probably would have survived easily. I‚Äôve healed this boss a few times on pservers and he hits like a tank but I just kinda spam heals on the tank and dps can usually do their job before I run OOM.
---
This is just poor playing
---
Thanks for the laugh friend :)
---
Private server
---
I was kind of assuming they'd send out quite a few invites right before that.  Ive read people speculating that more invites will go out after those tests, but to me that doesnt make much sense.  if you want to stress test, you open the game up to a bunch of people all at once so theyre creating a bunch of characters and logging in within a few hours of each other.
---
Who knows, though.
---
I'm 19 now, and started playing in 06, when I was 6. My dad played and he let me and my brother play too. We weren't very good, I cant say i remeber much about the game, and i didn't hit max level until Lich king when i was about 12. But I still have some fond memories of the Pre-cata game in my childhood.  Also funny as i've aged with Anduin, he was expac by expac my age.
---
lol i did play, i was 4 and my mom had me on the raid calls
---
Honestly if out of bounds exploring is your thing you are probably going to be highly disappointed with Classic.
---
All I want to do is start a guild called the Roman Empire and change the Guild Master rank to Caesar
---
Then whenever we‚Äôre in voice chat I will demand tutelage and obedience
---
The emails were delayed you most likely had access at the drop.
---
So were warriors in vanilla 
---
Warriors on pservers are not great until they get gear, just like vanilla
---
I'll need to see a video of a female undead rogue sprinting while stealthed...  That was one thing that made me race change later on.
---
Post removed. Please use the [Beta Bugs and Probelms Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp61yw/beta_bugsproblems_megathread_report_issues_here/)
---
I reckon you'll get in with another wave, especially given that you've been accepted to a beta already.
---
Lol my thoughts exactly. Everyone is in grad school or just finishing their PhD. I‚Äôm also getting my doctorate in mechanical engineering and just got hired as a senior level designer at nasa to design the next rocket that will get a human life form to mars. Please send good vibes!
---
Ugh I wanted to post this comment
---
Ya man, I'm going to take the time to individually respond to the literal hundreds of people bitching in several threads about them
---
Did you ticket a GM because you knew your account history in BNet went back farther than what it showed?  I'm a day one player and my earliest transaction shows me purchasing an authenticator in 2010.  I petitioned a GM to see if they could actually find out when my WoW account was created but I haven't got a response back yet.  This is cool to see though.
---
I hope they don't listen.  I love that streamers are dying all the time, I want the old game.
---
There are, and since Classic and the Current versions are such different games, I doubt most players will play both equally after the initial launch.
---
I see there being mostly 2 categories of players:
---
Those who are currently playing that prefer the current version, who will try out classic for bit but ultimately go back to retail.
---
Then you have players who haven't played in a long time and who couldn't get into any of the latest expansions even when they tried it. And perhaps current players who just can't stand BFA. All of these will make up the majority of the Classic crowd imo.
---
Too expensive in Blizzards mind. You always scale your technology towards it's needs. And if the demand is not there 99.9% of the time you do not scale your architecture up to the 0.01%. So yeah, since you don't understand it you remain an idiot and you do nothing to disprove my points. Your loss, i win. Internet war ftw, epeen deluxe. Feel free to call your mommy for emotional support.
---
Missed a great ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me how to survey!‚Äù opportunity.
---
Post removed.
---
You seeing the rest of the posts now?
---
So? This is the reason people say these things, if they are not 100% like classic, thats another issue.
---
I'm seriously wondering what's wrong with you, champ.
---
to be fair, i'm 23 and started playing when i was 8 with my dads subscription
---
not in school tho #dropout
---
Let fate decide what happens.  For most wont hit 60.  And if they do, they will have that reputation as the tank who took the healers gear.
---
Starting period i dont think mattered at all or a small portion of invites.
---
I went through multiple accounts back in the day before they allowed linking them to 1 battle.net ID. The account i currently been using for years was from WOTLK even though I played vanilla.
---
I'm pretty sure my invite and past beta invites (MoP, Warlords,Legion,BFA) all came from testing the hell out of them when I was invited. Both legion and BFA i was invited in the first month with no active sub at the time. I'm quite certain part their criteria is re-inviting previous testers who actually tested.
---
Then im sure long standing accounts, media, streamers, etc have a part in it all too. Then just random luck.
---
I love all the people "MaH ReTaIl hAs FiVe MiLlIoN pLaYeRs!" Yea because they made it free and, added a shit ton of micro transactions. Make that shit cost 15$ a month no negotiations and, take out the micro transactions and watch that bitch boat sink like a ton of bricks. Retail sucks donkey balls. Shit even claiming it has 5 million players is pretty spurious considering Blizz aint giving us the numbers.
---
I'm with you that I'm stoked to visit unobtainable areas but there's other areas that are kinda rad to get to (under Org, troll village, maybe Disney Land DM's since we're in a 7.3.5 build) and the very off hand idea that it might get used for content that isn't Cata if classic is popular.
---
The options are in the beta already
---
I've been playing since mid-TBC. Thanks for the insult though, "lol".
---
I don't think you've thought through your perspective enough.  Kicking someone when you will never see them again still matters to that person.  Deleting a cloak on a beta with a level cap doesn't really hurt the other person either because it was clear none of them are taking it seriously.  This is a pretty pure example of no harm, no foul.
---
I hear you man. But, ultimately, Blizzard is the best of the worst in my mind. I'm gonna sub to the game. I ain't that strong not to. But if you're gonna stand by your principles then I (a random stranger on the internet you'll never meet or interact with) respect that.
---
Maybe, taurens had a huge area compared to other races because of their size. I guess they can just report it just to see if it's actually a bug or not. I know taurens hit targets from far away but I don't remember it being THAT far away.
---
I‚Äôm being a dick because I can bro and because I want to be.
---
PlAyErS aRe MuCh BeTtEr NoW
---
&gt;except it breaks immersion, can be exploited
---
acceptable losses for being guaranteed to play on the realm you want to apparently.
---
&gt;and its crucial for worldbosses in phase2
---
world bosses are just rarespawns, it's okay for those so, eh, who cares.
---
since world bosses are tuned for a max pop realm, if there's 3x max pop there *should* be 3x world spawns, it would be broken if there weren't.
---
&gt;where ion already said it HAS TO BE GONE by then, hopefully a lot earlier (like a few weeks in)
---
better get blizzard to write that into the T&amp;C or "sorry guys, we underestimated how many people would still be playing"
---
Fuck, I‚Äôve leveled 5 warriors to 60 including vanilla. Here‚Äôs to number six. Lok‚Äôtar ogar, brother!
---
Paladins get a lot of extra DPS against Undead and Demons thanks to Exorcism.  They're great in Strat, but in general they'll do significantly less DPS than Mages and Warlocks.
---
Betas haven't been about reporting bugs for a long time. Blizzard especially have been using them for marketing since like Cataclysm beta
---
Missing 2 pieces of gear would not make a boss smack you for 60% of your health in a single hit.
---
It's a bigger thing than you might imagine. I can see the appeal in just chillen and having fun, that's what classic is about, the journey, but there is a lot to do at 60 as well :)
---
[Yes](https://web.archive.org/web/20080319141926/http://tkasomething.com/deadzone.php)
---
Are you being sarcastic? Warlocks bring THE most utility out of any DPS class.
---
Wipe recovery
---
Summons
---
Off tank
---
Buffs
---
Fear tanking
---
High sustain in fights, in case multiple packs get pulled
---
Healthstones
---
Why wouldn't you bring a warlock? Slighly un-optimized DPS because they're affliction? I mean if that's your argument, then why bring an arms warr or a SPriest to tank or heal?
---
Is this blizzlike?

 [https://www.twitch.tv/tribe\_tv1/clip/TangentialCharmingOtterOptimizePrime?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/tribe_tv1/clip/TangentialCharmingOtterOptimizePrime?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)
---
yeah like they have to have some sort of server limit
---
so made up numbers lets say there is a max of 6 layers and 3k people per layer 
---
lets hope people get queued and there is a limit 
---
thats like 18k people on a server assume 50% drop off then they disable layers
---
you now have a 9k player server with no layers.
---
obviously 100% made up numbers but this is the obvious problem
---
if they massivly inflate the number of people per server then remove layers it couod be terrible for the game
---
Your hate speech bro. Clearly you dont like black folks.
---
True. Possibly a lack of people making undead too. Don't get me wrong, I saw people. A decent amount of people but it never felt crowded or never had to fight for mobs. Got to 9 as well.
---
The layers, pvp server and horde/alliance balance will always very your leveling experience.  I just hope that everyone who wants to experience the beta can get to. We've all waited so long for this.
---
Sure bring a lock, but charge him 4g for the trouble of bringing him.
---
Sometimes graphics issues are gameplay issues, though.  As a hyperbolic example, really old games have actions tied to frames.  So if you were to take a game designed for 30 FPS and play it on a modern computer that can run it at 210 FPS, you're running the game itself at 7x normal speed and it becomes a heck of a lot harder.
---
In the case of WoW, especially WoW classic with the shorter range on nameplates, there are things which modern graphics may affect, and if you use legacy graphics you may not even realize this.  The two biggest things are bushes and water.
---
* **Water** \- in Classic, it is very easy to hide in the water.  if you dive down a little bit you're barely indistinguishable from the NPCs.  This matters especially for things like horde players swimming up the STV coast to do Deadmines, or just PvP in general in areas with water.  It's also useful for sneaking past the road mobs in Arathi Basin.  Modern water is a lot easier to see through.  So if I have classic graphics and think I'm being sneaky, I might be easy pickings for someone using modern graphics.
---
* **Bushes** are the same thing.  If you go from a bush that's basically one big doodad to a more detailed bush, it can change how easily you can hide in bushes.  With the shorter range of nameplates appearing, hiding in bushes is a legitimate way to avoid WPVP.  
---
So it's not just "we don't want you to have pretty models."  It's "I don't want people with better graphics cards or people less limited by nostalgia to have an advantage."  It's also "I don't want to feel forced to use modern graphics to overcome any potential disadvantage."
---
I'm personally requiring all raid members to show up 2 hours before raid with a selected screen sharing program installed so I can inspect and ensure they are in a PvE spec, have proper key bindings, addons, and farmed consumables. If you have anything outside of the required meta you will be instantly gkicked.
---
Haha to be fair, I am in this category. I was in junior high when vanilla was released, and now I go to a technical college. I did attend university but hated it, and took a few years off between the two post secondaries, so that accounts for the large gap and still ‚Äúbeing in school‚Äù.
---
There is no point in trying to defend anything or say anything because everything gets twisted into being a sob story about them and how hard they had it or how something. Thanks though.
---
Yes. They'll be fine.
---
Influencers
---
LOL this again.
---
Until you think you're hidden but someone with better graphics sees you clear as day.
---
Try [this](https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html?rp=%2Faccount%2Fmanagement%2Fwow%2Fsubscription%2Fpayment-history.html&amp;r=US&amp;l=LOVEOLIVIA) link. I can't see prior to 2010 on the normal account management, but I can see my old history there. Oddly this one stops at 2014 for me though.
---
I don't want to sound like a toxic redditor, but if you missed that whole drama how do you know people are just being toxic for no reason?
---
Towelliee and his army of fanboys insults Classic community, if you want to see how toxic that guy is you can just check his reddit profile. I'd recommend basically his most downvoted comment on r/wow where he was insulting Asmongold for no goddamn reason.
---
I'm sorry I called someone like this "idiot". I guess I'm a toxic redditor.
---
I looked up schadenfreude on wikipedia and all it was was a link to this video.

I like this change tbh

I will play with my wife on a different character. It would be either a Warrior or a Priest - based on what my wife want's to play and if healer are needed or not.

So they only invited 2k people yesterday including Streamers, content creators and media.

They are not doing a brood beta this time around. 
---
Age of account only increases your chance to get invited to an extremely limited beta among millions of older accounts. 
---
So it is still random
---
You dont deserve beta
---
How so? It's the same cap as a vanilla realm and people don't disappear into thin air unless they get invited to a group from a player on another layer which there is no way of telling if they even are on another layer unless you're near them in game.
---
It‚Äôs not a paradox. I‚Äôm saying our memory might be skewed in some areas. Warriors on the beta are 4-5 shotting mobs in west fall with a shield and one hander.  Other than the past week or two ive never played a private server, and even in the past two weeks I‚Äôve been playing a mage on the private server.  However I did play a warrior my whole life  and I know that wasn‚Äôt possible to do for a long while. Wether that is possible now because A. Damage is too high. B. Hit chances are skewed for melee(I‚Äôve rarely seen melee attacks miss on the beta at least not as often as they used to) C. Mobs have different res and armor.     I‚Äôm not saying these are the reasons I‚Äôm just saying these are definitely possibilities. Also I am not complaining, I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs no way a warrior with a warrior with a 1h and a shield is tearing through west fall with little to no trouble solo. If this is correct then it‚Äôs correct.  But if it‚Äôs not correct then it definitely needs people to bring attention to it.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be Tank specced, but it helps if you‚Äôre at least 5% competent.
---
[It doesn‚Äôt](https://web.archive.org/web/20080319141926/http://tkasomething.com/deadzone.php). It only makes the deadzone be further out, think of it as it being 7-10 yards instead of 5-8.
---
Some zones were darker than they are now on BfA.
---
Some zones were brighter than they are now on BfA.
---
The only zones that were anything close to being very dark in Vanilla were Dustwallow Marsh and Thousand Needles. They have the nights right on the beta.
---
Beautiful. Classic male dwarf beautiful.
---
Nerf Casters
---
&gt;**Druid:** druids are rare enough that whatever clever name you can come up with is probably available.
---
Unless you're Horde, in which case some sort of cow pun is the respectable way to do it. :P
---
You are incorrect. Welcome to Classic WoW.
---
I have zero interest in the min/max philosophy deciding how I play the game. I've had enough of that in Retail.
---
save time. more success.
---
I heard they made every race have the Tauren hitbox?.
---
Tips just seems like a guy who thinks he remembers exactly how it was and the game is only right if it plays like it should in his head. 
---
He sounds like the typical "I played in Vanilla" but "never really played it" type of player. He pushed the right click reporting shit so far like it was literally THE thing to make or break classic. It's all I ever heard him bring up in podcasts and it was eventually like "again with this shit?". I can't watch any of his stuff anymore.
---
Yeah, tauren vs tauren combat range is basically a telekinetic fight. It's less egregious when a tauren is fighting opponents with normal hit boxes.
---
This is true in alot of private servers I've played. Could be true in the beta as well.
---
I was in elementary school when I played towards the end of vanilla. Just finishing my bachelor's now. Doesn't seem that unlikely.
---
People who complain about graphical settings are complaining just to be obtuse and contradicatory. I get the feeling if they kept the graphics the same as 1.12.1, they'd be complaining about how the game should run better on modern hardware.
---
Or a moron
---
I started uni when I was 24 so yeah.
---
So u can randomly get a stomach bug and have to leave early üôÇ
---
The humor did not age well for me.
---
Man this subreddit is starting to get real toxic..
---
lol, if i leave early its going to be so i can go fishing.  Weather looks like its going to be shitty this weekend, so i have to try to get fishing time in when i can :(
---
I remember logging into my warlock on my brothers account when I was like 9. I was in Tarren Mill. And there were several hundred people from the horde and alliance all just going hard on each other. I was so confused and this mage gave me some food and said to fight! I was like ok. Level 25 warlock getting killed over and over. But it was a sight to behold.
---
Hard to prove a negative. Maybe not solely based on sub time but I never talked to anyone last night that was a Wrath Baby or beyond. Everyone I talked to played during.  Vanilla.
---
I want to preface my answer by saying I, personally, am not strictly nochanges. I want a graphics remaster, more specifically.
---
That said, I also personally believe it is unwise to let the playerbase decide on content and changes, even with a vote, *even* if we limit it to level 60s to weed out tourists who aren't as invested in the game. Why? Because the WoW playerbase is the reason the modern game is what it is and many of us vanilla/tbc/wotlk fans don't play it anymore.
---
We have the benefit of hindsight. A lot of changes over the years--class balance, flying, gear catch-up, speeding up many in-game tasks, reducing grindiness and tedium, etc, changed the pacing and feel of the game over time to such a degree that a lot of us quit playing and trickled off over the years.
---
Additionally, Classic is a thing for copyright reasons. Deviating significantly from the "vanilla" model bring Blizzard right back to one of the biggest reasons they started this--competing with private servers in countries that don't enforce Blizzard's I.P. rights. Brack said they can't just let these servers run unchallenged because there is no clearcut protection for Blizzard's rights in that scenario. This is a way to draw a lot of us back into the fold, turn a profit, and discourage a lot of pserver activity. As soon as the players vote in an ilvl increase, class balance, or something else I think would be detrimental to the classic experience, I'd be one of likely many saying "so long and thanks for all the fish" and quitting WoW entirely or starting up another pserver.
---
You also mention in a comment about trusting Blizzard. Well, a lot of us don't. That's the problem. Blizzard has a history of knee-jerk reactions, opposite extremes, and if given an inch will take several miles so to speak. I don't trust modern Blizzard, as good as their intentions and as passionate about WoW as they may be, to adhere faithfully to early 2000s MMO design. I simply don't, the entire spirit has changed, the main MMO demographic has changed, that would undoubtedly leak into classic development if they aren't sticking to what's in the database.
---
Would you be happy if you would get into the beta? Yes? So why should anybody give you something for being happy?
---
If you think this is how life works...you will be disappointed!
---
(Please note, as always, layering and sharding are used interchangeably because they're the same fucking thing)  
---
The problem with these diagrams is that they can't answer the questions that Blizzard has glossed over or avoided.
---
* Are layer assignments persistent (Will we always be assigned to the same shard, meaning will we have persistence of community with the collapse of layers being akin to server merges) If they are persistent, does that mean we get teleported back to our old shard if we leave a group/guild, in much the same way that we get teleported out of an instance?
---
* If they aren't persistent and are basically just "start a new one when the old one is full" how are you going to deal with the "6004 people on the server, 3000 in shard 1, 3000 in shard 2, and 4 in shard 3" problem.
---
* Will chat be connected?  3000 people in Durotar - General is going to be an insane chat log, but It'll be hard to group or recruit between layers once the population spreads out a bit if chat isn't connected, especially once some people pull ahead of the pack.
---
* Will we be able to move freely between layers? Because if joining a guild or a group gets you teleported to that guild/group's respective shard then we might as well be allowed to just right click the map and choose a shard the way we became able to right click and "reset instance" instead of having to keep inviting someone to group, make them leader, and disband to flip.
---
* Are shard sizes going to be dynamic?  It's not population that makes the tourist problem so bad.  Private servers managed to do just fine with 10k populations.  The problem is population density.  3000 people per shard split over three newbie zones is a lot more of a problem than 10,000 people spread over the entire game.
---
Rolling a Shadow priest this time around, never had the courage first time:p
---
You cant casually play feral dps unless you just do 5man and mc.  Off spec classes are more for your advanced player that is willing to go through the social stigma of playing an OS.
---
I tuned in for five minutes during that run.
---
Fucking hilarious. Tips out getting lost and dying repeatedly during an easy dungeon run holding up the group for everyone else until his gear turned red. Dude doesn't deserve to be in the beta.
---
Have you even read anything about it? Ion said it's 100% gone once world bosses come.
---
I think a lot of people like to min/max raids just because you want to see success and may as well do it quicker I suppose.
---
That said, there will 100% be more casual raiding guilds that will let you run Elemental Shaman or whatever it is that you want to do.
---
I just resigned after not playing wow for years.... where‚Äôs my Beta invite? Reeee lol.
---
TIL TBC videos uploaded on WarcraftMovies in 2008 are ‚Äúpserver videos‚Äù.
---
tbh thats sweet :P
---
The point of my post is the comparison between a warlock and a ret/shadow/ele/balance as dps in comparison. 
---
All of the mhave some sort of utility.
---
Gimme free shit or U dumb.
---
Why not adopt the BDO server hop system where there is a cooldown before you can hop again? Let's say it was something like an hour or so. Then at least you would think twice before hopping as you're temporarly stuck but you can still join friends/groups.
---
Someone is upset that they don‚Äôt get to play the beta.
---
Right.  You can min/max your character and spec and gear choices while still playing casually.
---
Take my upvote.
---
You act like its going to be a common enough thing to have a "severe impact" on world pvp.
---
No it did not.
---
exactly, im guessing:  
---
2 kalimdor and 2 eastern kingdoms layers.
---
Temporary maximum capacity: 12k  
---
dropoff to around 35-40% of that initial size should be enough to get merged into one server after a few weeks :)  
---
(again, complete guesswork  here from me)
---
Wrong, this was definitely shot in TBC, I remember it being on the forums back then.
---
Hmm, maybe.  One of the things I try to do when I come across stuff like this is not just go with if something feels wrong but why it feels wrong.  The is for certain something that feels wrong to me but I'm prob just taking it too seriously.  I first saw this clip after he ran in and wiped on the wc 2nd to last boss and was like what an idiot, I was ready to dislike the guy after he caused the party to wipe.  Maybe it's jelousy too, I know for sure if I was in the beta I'd be treating it differently, but I'd want to work more  on bug reports and addon development then stream it lol.  I wrote so much about something like this, let me innnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!
---
it'll be too late by the time it happens, just like how we go through this every single expansion
---
Dude has tried and played more content than 99% of beta users currently..
---
Many beta testers outside of these streamers have commented that mobs actually have skills. So, you‚Äôll be stunned, get aoe‚Äôed, etc. by just general mobs.
---
It‚Äôs my understanding that many pservers couldn‚Äôt get every skill for each mob, so many mobs just stood there and took a beating.
---
Naturally, if this is the case leveling will be slower and harder for everyone.
---
They don't give streamers access to test bugs. How do you not get this?
---
update?
---
My guild is from a vanilla Pservers, we‚Äôre going horde to it have any ret pallys. But also no meme spec shamans or Druids either, war/rogue/mage/warlock/hunter dps only.
---
Why does this sub hate efficient players? Mabye its fun for me to be stacked with gold and the best gear for my class. it sure does help you in the long run
---
These guys aren‚Äôt there for their quality bug reports. They are there to promote the game.
---
/r/Gatekeeping
---
People complaint about ‚Äûimproved‚Äú graphics, are just people complaining about everything. It‚Äòs not even updated graphcis, just some little textures and lightning improvements. Can‚Äòt take these guys seriously..
---
Right. Ideally you want Blackcrow. And for the first Phase of the game, it's your only option.
---
Satyr's Bow is budget Blackcrow.
---
up in canada
---
https://www.ebgames.ca/
---
itll be too late to flame/whine? what are u saying? do you want to propose an alternative solution?
---
All of Blizzards betas are closed, especially at the start.
---
if you could not stand in fire or pull agro you were the right guy for the raid
---
My friend's back must still hurt from carrying the raid on his disc in SoO.
---
&gt; It's like Blizzard sits down in meetings and asks... "What's the dumbest  things we could do to piss people off the most", then instead of  avoiding those things, DOES them. 
---
No, they probably sat down and thought, hey what can we do to make more money? 
---
Because that's what a company does, their ultimate goal is to make money. Don't act so shocked about it.
---
How do you bug test?
---
By completing the content
---
It would be crazy for them not to have color blind mode. That's not even a game play thing. It's just letting some people play without being disabled. I am sure they will have that.
---
Ideally I hope they have both updated and classic graphics. If they only do one I hope for the classic graphics though. The reason is access. Part of classics magic is you can play it on a potato. So no friends get left behind because of their rig.
---
I posted the silly pickachu meme a couple days ago. My inbox since then has given me cancer. I‚Äôll see you in the chemo ward soon.
---
I by no means go hard playing games, new releases etc. But I play with a goal in mind, whether thats "I'm going to get 2 levels today" or "I'm going to finish this zone today"
---
I won't be able to play day 1, it'll be about a week in I believe when I can play as I have work away around that time. I think I'll end up being around 2-3 weeks behind the hard-hardcore players, which i'm not worried about honestly.
---
Classic always takes time, yes people will have cleared Molten Core by the time i'm level 60 but i'll catch up during patches.
---
I don't care if there are optional graphics upgrades but don't force new particles on people. I heard several spells had slightly altered effects.
---
Meh/10 
---
This is from a just released cinematic though
---
I don‚Äôt like the guy very much but you are very stupid for this comment üôÇ
---
They are harder than end game heroics, too.
---
I agree with him, he isnt asking for free shit, he said he is fine qith paying a sub to play, just isnt ok with sub being required for a chance for inv.
---
Can you add stream links by chance?
---
People in their early 20s could be in college at this point, and if they played during vanilla when they were kids they could have been around 10 in 2004-2006. So it's not at all unfeasible. 
---
What's more likely though is that the subreddit isn't a monolith and its actually different people saying different things. Unless you can point to a specific example where a user has said they played in 2004 and are still in school now.
---
But this is the first time it has required an active subscription to have a chance to get into.
---
&gt; completely re-creating vanilla 
---
porting the world data from 1.12.
---
It already exists, they just fucked with it enough to get the new client to understand it.
---
You dont use block because you block damage, you block because you can't be crit or crushed when you perform a block. I can guarantee he was crit there. But besides the point, 2 pieces of broken gear is a decent hindrance. Especially a chest piece. It's just the classic didnt wait for healer/soda is not paying attention.
---
If we want servers to have communities closer to Vanilla than the toxicity/elitism of private servers, this is exactly what we need to do. Part of the appeal was that we were all clueless and had to help each other learn; I remember still needing to teach new Warlocks in my guild to dismiss pets for jump skips a year after launch, and Classic will be no different.
---
Min/max is fun to me. But I don't give a hoot what others do, unless it's making things difficult for a group. The group is more important than the individual wanting to play however they want.
---
Yeah, being able to avoid pvp by just shifting to another layer is pretty severe desu.
---
because loot trading sucks and many people would abuse it
---
You know he has been reporting bugs as he went right?
---
I was young when I played wow a little after release so probably started in 05, finished my undergrad 2.5 years ago so I'm close to that mark. And if I decide to go for my masters I'll still be in school technically.
---
Loads of reasons. I think you were thinking just straight k-12
---
I'm going to disagree on that. I didn't see anything that looked like night when I was watching streams.
---
It‚Äôs just people who didn‚Äôt get in complaining.
---
Desperation is a stinky perfume.
---
I up voted you. I will not let him strike you down friend!
---
https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok?t=148
---
Look at where the range this tauren stops when he charges the human
---
Watch the whole fight
---
The clip in question is two Tauren who both have large hit boxes and could appear longer due to FOV and larger monitors these days compared to back in the day. It does indeed look long I will admit. But honestly the distance between them and the length the hammer reaches on the swing seems very familiar to me from dueling Tauren.
---
lmao whatever you say bud.
---
I agree, similar to obtaining like the pirate hat or the parrot from STV, they're niche things to do outside of the core game itself.
---
lol its no wonder the classic people get such a bad rep...just look how you all act LOL
---
Yes, Tauren should have a bigger range, but that's WAAAY bigger than the Vanilla one.
---
That does feel petty, I'll prob just unsub to his youtube.
---
&gt;but its more similar to wow classic than it is modern wow
---
Gonna have to chime in as somebody who has played both games since launch through their latest expansions (for XIV that means 1.0 as well as ARR). ARR is much **much** closer to retail than classic.
---
-Leveling to 50 took less than a week at ARR launch. Most of that was honestly the MSQ too. Taking a class from 1-50 with just fate grinding could be done in 2 days.
---
-Questing is much more streamlined like it is in retail than vanilla wow
---
-The job system is like dual spec taken to the extreme, a lot of raiders I know will main a role and just have everything of that role capped if not maxing everything and just playing whatever their static needs.
---
-The same thing applies to crafting/gathering jobs (the equivalent of professions) you can do everything completely by yourself. You never need to rely on another player to have something crafted for you.
---
-Classic fans often complain about the MoP talent rehaul and praise the greater flexibility the old talent trees have. XIV doesn't even have anything like MoP talents, every player of a job will have the exact same skills except for a few role-based options which are largely homogenized.
---
-Classic fans also complain about ability pruning and how a lot of the quirky vestigial RPG-like spells have been pruned (stuff like sentry totem, eyes of the beast). XIV doesn't have any of this due to the way their job system works. They don't even have stuff retail still has like mage food or lockstones. Every spell has some combat purpose with pretty much nothing extraneous.
---
-Duty finder (Dungeon finder) existed in ARR. I can probably count on two hands the number of times I've actually walked to a dungeon (most of it is just to unlock it on the duty finder) .
---
-Every character can teleport to any town they've been to any time they want for a nominal fee. The only time you walk or mount is going to a specific area within a zone or traveling to a new zone for the first time.
---
-World PvP straight up doesn't exist. 
---
I could go on but this is just off the top of my head.  **I think ARR was an excellent game and enjoyed playing it** but it is clear as day to anybody who plays it that it is firmly entrenched in modern MMO design philosophy, arguably even more so than retail WoW in many respects. On that same note I don't think there will be as much overlap between XIV and classic since unlike retail it's not like their sub fee gets them classic access too. And for the overlap that does exist, blizzard gave them almost 2 months to play shadowbringers before classic drops.
---
Haven't watched the clip, yet. Is it the horse in SFK?
---
The op used Tips and Staysafe as an example of "rival" streamers and /u/DontGiveMeGoldKappa decided to dump on staysafe, but not tips.  
---
I responded that Staysafe has a larger viewer base on classic beta launch, so he would have a larger chance to impact a server pop.
---
I didn't say staysafe was good, but that he was relatively larger than tips in the original comparison.
---
Honestly when you‚Äôre raid leading you want as optimal a comp as possible. Not just for yourself, but for all the other people in the raid. You can‚Äôt afford to carry passengers and it‚Äôs not fair to the people who are contributing more. That being said if you can perform with an off meta spec well enough that you are above the pack you will always have a spot with me.
---
Honestly, I want your dismembered and broken body hung from the walls of Orggrimar. Was that too much?
---
Man. I would still be like level 10 in that shit. I would've been trying to explore and interact with everything to make sure Blizzard doesnt fuck this up.
---
Agreed! Someone approaching the game the same way they would retail and expecting the same outcome should make for some quick realizations. Not everyone who is interested in Classic is going to have past experience to draw on, and they shouldn't be lambasted for it. 
---
But if a player coming from retail rages and assumes the game is broken and complain about it, rather than trying to play differently, that we run into a problem. It seems like the Classic team is a good bunch and knows what they're doing, so I hope they're able to look past toxic players like this to deliver a great experience.
---
&gt; It's pretty fucking obvious that they're leaving the door open...
---
Where'd you get this?  Last I heard they explicitly said it will be gone by the end of Phase 1.
---
I'm sure the devs are grown adults who would prefer a bug report that says "Hey, I'm not totally sure but I think mechanic x is working improperly and may be worth investigating" as opposed to having stuff go ignored and be wrong on release.
---
Lol literally every keyboard warrior comes out. I‚Äôve gotten /r/gatekeeping about 20 times. People are just so soft these days that they rush to defend something. Oh well they all just prove a point I guess.
---
Fair. It's also the first time they've admitted they're taking into account things like account age and other stuff. Starting with an open beta is a pretty ridiculous request.
---
you'll have plenty of time to flame/whine after phase 1 when layering is still in the game
---
we had a better alternative solution, sharding starter zones for the first few days
---
I'm at work atm and don't have access to my authenticator, I'll check it out when I get home though, thanks!
---
Tried hard for 3 years on the private server grind... now i just want to savor the leveling experience by taking my time to dork around with noobs and do sidequests and just be silly.  The best time for wow is from initial launch to the end of bwl, in terms of community and overall server activity.  And there really is no rush to complete content unless your goal is to fight for top dog.  For me, that overwatch, esports mentality is killing gaming and at this point... i just want to be a part of a living, breathing, honorable community.
---
Idk how old you are.
---
It doesn't matter what you are aiming for. When you've completed your goal it's now just completed. Best of luck!
---
After playing 3 different Warlocks in Vanilla I doubt it is even anywhere close to that
---
I forgot about that shit - just "/who 60" and start spamming for ppl to finish a dungeon with us. "you're on last boss and have a summon? invite"
---
Ion Hozzikostas states in this interview Layering will last 2-3 weeks and certainly will NOT be implemented at all when world bosses launch.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8) 
---
You guys love getting hysterical over NOTHING. stfu and enjoy the game.
---
As an older guy who start vanilla in my early 20's, I'm surprised that there isn't more discussion threads in this sub as well. Hell, even you had to express your opinion in a meme or no one would have read it.
---
But I soon can to realize that a lot of the original fan base is still in their 20's, maybe in the later half, because they all started playing at like 10 years old apparently. It's hard for me to fathom trying to level to 60 and then do end game stuff at that age. But I suppose it's not that surprising considering how good my nephew can be at games in general.
---
Now get off my lawn kids!!
---
Of all the flavors to choose, far too many chose salty.
---
For sure not 50/50. If you are just watching streamers that are grouping together to level (And a lot of them were) then yeah your going to see a lot of streamers playing. Me personally anyway only saw a handful and they were the to be expected to play humans streamers like Asmongold and Esfand, Towelie?(spelling).
---
Use Case diagram AND a Sequence Diagram?
---
I give an A+.
---
I've always been poor too but you get so much gold from quests in tbc.
---
Don‚Äôt forget how it feels when the DPS each focus a different target, accidently ninja pull or DoT the sheep.
---
MMO's live by the law of the Highlands friend. There can be only one. Their is only one MMORPG, AND HE DOES NOT SHARE SUBSCRIBERS!!!
---
Sometimes you take a sick day for your mental health. Doesn't always have to be a bed ridden sick day.
---
I have never in my life seen someone do this
---
The sense of community and feeling like you're apart of something like in wpvp is why a lot of people would prefer it over BFA right now. Retail raiding is amazing and the complexity isn't a negative however the gearing system and the abundance of quality of life features in the game makes the game good for nothing but logging on for raids or arena.
---
The turn around for making content is much higher in WoW and it involves a much bigger string of people. The fact that Wow ended up being so good was the result and accident by some awesome developers. Blizzards work processes and philosophies are so different today that I don't trust them.
---
Ge doesnt want to play beta for free, he said he is fine qith paying a sub to play.
---
I could put in more
---
&gt; So we hopped on the giant waterwheel for safety.
---
Yupp, definitely how it was in vanilla.
---
I was 15 when I started playing the game in early 05 but my brother was 9 when he started a little less than a year later, and was main tanking Karazhan clears at 10 years old. I'm confident he remembers doing that and playing well into Cata.
---
im tired of discussing this tbh. Maybe you wanna read one of the many dozens discussions here regarding this topic in the last 48 hours to see the benefits/disadvantages of the different propositions.
---
i, for myself, think that layering is the best solution everything considered (and considering it works how were told)
---
Hahaha, true i did stand around a LOT playing on my old toaster I upgraded with an abacus!
---
Glad I‚Äôm not alone in this thinking lol
---
Hi, /u/1v1rustmeleeonly
---
You right, hopefully blizzard doesn't change a thing but once all the content roles out I hope players get to decide where to go next. I think they should always keep classic, classic and always keep a state of the version were it's completely vanilla.
---
Mid TBC =/= Vanilla
---
He didnt say at any point that he diserves or should get an inv.
---
Normally I don‚Äôt care about most streamers and I don‚Äôt understand the hate they get.  My opinion is: if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt watch it, don‚Äôt talk about it, it‚Äôs not
---
worth living your life with a bunch of negative opinions floating around in your head. 
---
BUT- the fact that these guys reported this as a bug is absolutely juvenile to me. What a group of entitled children.  
---
I get the situation the dev team is in.  This couldn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt been an easy sell to the board (launching Classic).  They really need the numbers at launch to prove that it was worth it to the shareholders (shareholders who btw couldn‚Äôt give a shit about your nostalgia), so they need the streamers to be on board to bring in the new generation. 
---
So I guess I see both sides of the argument. I guess my point is that these streamers have been given a big responsibility here - beta testing and hype.  They are good at hype.  Shame to see they don‚Äôt care as much about the quality of the game itself.  Reporting your bad play as a bug just means that you care more about the way your viewers see you as some ‚Äútop‚Äù player more than you care about your role in the development of the game.
---
The pay for a sub, and a chance at beta, problem solved
---
Exciting!
---
He also doesn‚Äôt have shield block on his bars which will prevent a crit if used

Is it possible for this sub to get any more salty at content creators for their beta access? Really. Find something productive to do. August is way off into the future.
---
Wasted over 3 hours in WC
---
We don't know how frequently the waves will happen, if it will be daily, weekly, etc. Just keep checking your launcher daily and report back if you got an invite so we can try to figure it out.
---
That is pretty cool, I didn't start til the end of vanilla so the chances it will get to me are pretty low but I like seeing they are going after people passionate about the game.
---
You‚Äôre going to simply throw away an opportunity to insult someone? üëÄ
---
18s more than enough, doable at 17 but a bit slower due to trickier pulls. There's no excuse for this.
---
I'm pretty sure chance and the rest of them have been up for over 24+ hours at the least by now. I think they're all just dead ass tired so they make simple mistakes.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
You should look into doing this kind of thing as a job then!
---
Why? You don‚Äôt pay for the game. You don‚Äôt support the company. You don‚Äôt pay their bills. Why would they invite you? 
---
15 years ago the game set records, it‚Äôs proven successful. They need reliable bug feedback, not freeloaders. Get a job.
---
If you didn‚Äôt max math in your early levels, you‚Äôre not permitted on this sub.
---
Lol there are no keys. Unless you bought an account with beta access from eBay.
---
you know, I agree with you actually when reading this 100%, but when playing it, no.
---
I do think youre right it just doesnt feel that way to me.  Modern wow and FF14 feel NOTHING alike to me, as ff14 feels like an old school mmo rpg (which is what I like about it) and reminds me of wow classics/everquest. 
---
modern wow feels like modern wow.
---
with that said, I actually PREFER the feeling of wow right now as a game, but my god I hate how every class plays except warrior and its ruining it for me.
---
cheers though, great post and youre correct
---
I see a lot of people not understanding the point that is being made with this post. Its **not** about being salty that you are not invited to the beta and its **not** being about wanting to play the beta for free.  It's about having to pay to be in the pool of players eligible for a beta invite. It's basically a lottery. I for one wont buy a lottery ticket. But i would pay to play the beta if i got an invite beforehand.
---
Anyone who played back then will remember Verdan the Everliving hitting like a monstrous truck. I always got spooked whenever healing for this boss. Working as intended, tips is just not a good tank. But muh bugg lmaoooo
---
And friendship was made.
---
Paladin.
---
Only healer that can really farm without respecting. I could even tank dungeons, easy boost to low lvls etc. I just love the versatility and the class fantasy.
---
They're really similar, vanilla content was unchanged.
---
I've been playing vanilla pservers for the past 4 years. Thanks for the insult and block list addition.
---
What if I did Max it but I also maxed out lying?
---
My aunt took 8 years to finish her bachelor's while working full time. She is almost 50.
---
There is no excuse holding you back but your shitty attitude. In the wise words of lebouf... JUST. DO IT.
---
&gt; I'm surprised that there isn't more discussion threads in this sub as well. Hell, even you had to express your opinion in a meme or no one would have read it.
---
Well I posted a thread earlier this week asking people what the hatred is around youtubers/streamers and I got a shit load of long form responses, so people are willing to discuss these things, but for this thought I think a meme sufficed in getting my general point across. Having said that, if people want to discuss it in here I'm open to that
---
I'm assuming a lot of people here are in their 20s and I thought that was old enough to not have the collective here seem to whiny to be honest. It actually feels like the tone of this sub shifted dramatically in the last few days since the whole content creator/blizzard/beta release has happened. Everyone just seems salty as fuck now and the community as a whole appears petulant because of it. Maybe it's a small vocal minority causing that but their opinions seem pretty popular in the threads comprised primarily of bitching about content creators
---
I'm gonna print this out on a post-it note to my monitor to read every time I see yet another fucking retail rogue think their role in a group is to solo down an elite.
---
And as he pointed out, they are asking for all this people to give their money so they could just have a chance, which is not ok.
---
Oh, just saying, I'm 35, was a day 1 wow player, but, haven't touched WoW in probably 8 years.
---
Can't remember degaussing, but holy shit thank god for the invention of the laser mouse, those balls were magnets for every sort of crap imaginable.
---
No, they are giving a chance to people who actually currently play the game, perfectly fine to do
---
The official schedule announcement on Blizzard's site only has:
---
* Stress Test 1: Wed May 22‚ÄìThurs May 23
---
* Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19‚Äì Thurs Jun 20
---
* Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18‚Äì Fri July 19
---
i wonder how old my main account is
---
some time end of vanilla i transfered my main onto a totally different account so i could dual box
---
i think for a short period you could transfer alts on to a totally different account
---
i unfortunately dont have wow tokens on both accounts so i cracked one on the account i did , im not actually sure which is the older totally 
---
i actually have 1 account that has 2 accounts on it and the second main account not sure why i ended up with 1 account having 2 accounts on it
---
Hah, I NEVER wanted Hunters in my first few dungeons...always aggroing stuff with their pets and shooting mobs that we hadn't pulled.
---
I also just remembered that I didn't know what 'Fade' did on my Priest.  I thought it was like a Rogue's stealth and would try to Fade past mobs.  It was like level 25 or something when I saw another Priest used it to drop aggro lol.
---
Don‚Äôt blame them. Salted caramel is so good ü§§
---
Of course it's a cash grab. As much as I hate it, its honestly a genius move. I would love to see how many subs renewed the day they announced prior to beta opening.
---
Or maybe use the time off that you have earned in the way that you deem most fit, because you're an adult.
---
thats just so incorrect its funny
---
He literally thinks Vanilla was BfA but with no expansions, he's actually a tard and him and all his fans seriously need to stay away from Classic
---
I played in 04' and still in school. I mean it's a master's program, but still in school.
---
If I'm not in a guild, do I get the surname "Solo"?
---
You know what‚Äôs up.
---
If it makes you feel any better I've been subbed every month since bc as well as on and off in vanilla and didnt get an invite :D
---
*pact
---
Will do for the ones I know
---
Design decisions have already changed from when they announced classic because of community feedback. If no one argued that ZG and BWL shouldn't come out in the same phase, that's probably what would still be happening.
---
Dude read the sticked link at the top of this sub
---
GOT MINE

---
I was pleasantly shocked when I got home. I would hope at least most other OG Vanilla players get a chance to test things out. The more eyes the better IMO. The more interest people show now will lesson the chances of server overload on launch day. Smooth launch for me really matters. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to sit and wait for fixes on my vacation time heh. My wife and I both are going to play together. She is a Legion baby. Looking forward to showing here the eras of the game I truly cherished. Vanilla - Wrath.
---
Sharding will be only in starting zones and only for first couple weeks! Ion said that didnt you watch the stream? :D
---
Ok thanks
---
Oh man. Gonna report myself for being idiot
---
all u need for classic WoW is an active subscription, nothing else.
---
Not really related to raiding but Twinking can be a ton of fun, but I see why it's not for everyone.  Min Maxing a lv 39 is a ton of work, and if you don't enjoy the ride I don't think you will get a commensurate amount of joy out of steamrolling bgs.
---
Yeah, the whole concept of threat and aggro was foreign to me.  Other games I've played, it was dependent on proximity.
---
That system just isn't in place anymore. You could try contacting blizzard and see what they say but you're more than likely going to have to pay 15 to sub.
---
The statute, mounts in game, and I want to say there was an art book
---
Still need a cc from what I remember but yes 1 month free...on a new acct
---
I don‚Äôt trust anything that you‚Äôre saying.
---
For them to be rare enough to still be a big accomplishment to have them, but still a possibility to get through lot of grinding.
---
 I don't know if you really know the impact it had when they got removed on patch 1.4 but it cause quite a huge commotion.
---
Almost as if "Blizzard" isn't one team and as soon as money's involved, the money men come in. Huh.
---
Fuck that, it would be a shit show if it was an open beta.
---
Looks like it is :) [https://github.com/Daribon/wow-ui-source/tree/classic](https://github.com/Daribon/wow-ui-source/tree/classic)
---
Not really. A masters takes 5-6 years total if you don‚Äôt take advantage of college credits earned in high school, which would make you 23-24 when graduating.
---
I'm in, subbed on and off since launch, not a streamer media or content creator.
---
Just won the lottery I guess?
---
How is wallpaper engine? Worth using?
---
&gt; old history there. Oddly
---
Can confirm that this worked for my account! Shows all the way back to my "free month" 1/2/2005.
---
Thanks for that link.
---
Well yeah... we‚Äôre talking about it
---
It's way smaller cause of resolution?
---
Are you insinuating every single wow streamer suffers from depression because of some random dude on reddits hot take? This entire sub is full of bitter people because they didn't get invited to the fucking beta lol
---
This is the actual right answer
---
Spoilers ban was lifted a few days ago, if you haven't seen it yet you probably didnt care that much.
---
He hates the vanilla wow crowd because so many of them are toxic little shits who don't seem to understand that someone could like both versions of the game. then those same people would sit there and argue with him about why their prefered version is "better".
---
While there are still obvious bugs like this? I don't think Blizzard is actively seeking out shitstorms, lol.
---
I'm not sure what's causing it but it seems smaller but the same style.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/FunnyInquisitiveMouseVoteYea
---
Isnt this very similar, on gnomes no less?
---
Yeah people keep saying it's random, but if you look at the beta post on the front page or the classic wow forums, it seems like a significant majority of 'normal' invites went to day 1 players.
---
When did you start playing though? Day 1?
---
Pretty much.
---
Oh yeah.  Big part of it is effectively marking and calling for CC and kicking retards. 
---
But at least as the tank you have some control as opposed to being a healer where people expect you to just heal everyone through everything.
---
Omg a change, the game is *clearly* unplayable now.
---
You go ahead and check how many people make it to 60 in under a week vs how many total players there are and get back to me ;)
---
I'm watching the stream now, he's getting smoked doing regular quests lol.   Yeah mhmm it's bugged, sure... haha
---
Slide 10 is global.
---
Number of connections is also really astounding and includes mobile but that can easily be misleading. I would wager the mobile market is much more fragmented.
---
yes, the dead zone starts and ends ~3yards further out. So i.e. a mage needs to stand much further back to position himself correctly without being in melee range of the hunter which can be more difficult to judge.
---
That's true, but it's also true that many people simply lie about playing vanilla wow.
---
Jesus walked on water.  Chuck Norris swam through land.
---
Not a fan of ret paladin game play =P
---
Completely agreed. The people that say layering is the same as this but seemless are just delusional in my opinion
---
That's closer to how they were in War3.
---
http://classic.battle.net/war3/orc/units/tauren.shtml
---
It wasnt rated well for sure, but my expectations were so low that I wasnt disappointed (even with all the lore differences).
---
have you been watching? I can dm you loads of clips with them
---
Wouldnt it be the other way around? Higher graphics has more foliage/reflections/stuff like that.
---
A group of 5 people who know each other doing a dungeon together who happen to be streaming it are horrible people because they play a way you don't like? Some people on this sub have become quite literally the biggest whiny babies I've ever seen on this entire fucking website.
---
The game doesn‚Äôt come out for 3 months. He‚Äôs playtesting the game, he‚Äôs also advertising for blizzard. It‚Äôs exciting, let people have fun. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs blatantly not trying to find bugs. How is he going to test the level 30 stuff if he doesn‚Äôt level up? It‚Äôs part of the game this subreddit needs to chill out. Sorry you didn‚Äôt get into beta bud.
---
They can tank 5-mans really well at higher levels. They cannot tank raids.
---
In raids they specialize in tank healing through Flash of Light. 
---
&gt;DPS
---
If you want to tank Raids, you pretty much have to be a Warrior. A Druid is serviceable imo too
---
It was in Strat Live. :)
---
I fail like constantly but I do try to be a good person lol.  Like I would feel like shit if he actually read my comment, though I think the chance is super low.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be more fun to spice things up a bit? I‚Äôd take at least 8 shadow priests
---
I was wondering if anyone was doing that.  Blizzard prob hates it as it can make pservers better and more accurate.
---
No one cares
---
May I suggest moving to a country that matters?
---
The average player will min/max to their depth of knowledge and patience. So the question is kind of loaded.
---
Does a NE priest with full world buffs and two bags of consumables count as a min/max player?
---
Not sure why tips is popular. I watched one of his ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù videos which was kind of terrible, and after the 6th ‚Äúabsolutely insane‚Äù and 9th ‚ÄúI gotchu I gotchu‚Äù I had to turn it off
---
Yea but then I'd have to watch a Paladin level. Ew
---
I'm dying of laughter. We've come full circle. People are now begging for mob phasing in classic. We're fucking doomed
---
I've started on Feb 14th 2005
---
I did r/sleep in the first church at undead zone
---
I didn't know how to get up...
---
I tried to ask in general chat but I didn't know how to type. 
---
I slept for a few hours, typing /wakeup /getup, and figured I could just start moving :')
---
I don't think he makes a good living only from his brand.
---
When one of my employees found out I played WoW he flipped out. 
---
"You don't look like you'd be into that kind of thing. WoW is for nerds!"   
---
"Did you just call your manager a nerd?...  You are correct".
---
I pretty much spammed all of my Vanilla guildies until they replied. I think we‚Äôre sitting at like 50% re-join rate, and they all expect me to run the guild....lol oh boy.
---
Then don't sub, i think its pretty fair that only paying customers have a shot at it.
---
Yeah.. Raggy and Onyxia are both raid bosses in cata+ expansions.
---
That means absolutely nothing. Most people want to get to 60 fast, but they might not have the time or skill to do it. Doesnt mean that they arnt interested in doing it, or attempting it. Thats why speed runners are so popular i.e. Joana.
---
Wait you sort of just did that thing you described
---
I can admit I started TBC. My friends kept asking me to play vanilla but I thought it looked like a boring game.
---
I will draw on my experience of raid leading in private servers from mc all the way through naxx.
---
It depends on what you are progressing,farming etc. 
---
There will be specs that will not get an invite, such as ret pala, enh/ele shaman. They don't offer enough in dps or utility to warrant a raid spot. Especially in progression, you need the best of the best and most optimal setups to succeed. 
---
For example, MC is easy and doesn't require a hugely optimised raid, however consider later more complex raids like AQ40 and beyond need more careful planning, better melee/ranged dps ratio, specific healers etc. 
---
There are other specs which opens a discussion, especially in light of one of the limiting factors of private servers was debuff slots, so that will give more flexibility with 16 from the start. 
---
From my point of view I will continue to pick the most optimal group for progression, farm content I am more flexible. My guild in particular will operate mid raid swapping for more complex fights that require more optimisation.
---
Hahahahaha
---
I'm really enjoying this sample of a leveling race. It's going to be quite the show on release.
---
Politely tell him you are disappointed in his actions and that you feel he would benefit more from not being a douche
---
A well-played Warlock is an awesome addition to any group.  I absolutely love having locks in my group.
---
Put on a dress and press Flash of Light
---
Seriously, it's hard to watch.
---
I don't need to take time off since I work from home lol
---
That would be pretty great. If Classic is successful enough that there are no fears of splitting up the playerbase then I'd definitely be more open to exploring new content or tweaks and changes that are still in the classic spirit. I'd probably even try them out. I just think it's important that those who want classic to always be classic have that option as a priority.
---
A pipe dream of mine is "pristine" versions of expansion servers re-tuned to be more in-line with classic design.
---
This is a Classic ^^tm L2play moment.
---
Can't use Retail strategies in Classic unless you actually know what you're doing (i.e. not the things you just listed...)
---
tbh im surprised there was no pet for classic
---
that would have been in line with vanilla
---
Although I'm an "older" guy, I actually watch quite a bit of twitch, but I think I'm an outlier. Most of twitch viewers are of the younger crowd, some in their 20's but a ton who are even younger. 
---
So I think what you said about "content creator/Blizzard/beta release" is probably quite true, especially as of late since streamers  are the ones who broke the news about beta and the release date. I bet a lot of older folks found out about from their kids, lol. 
---
I didn't get in to beta, and although it be nice, I don't expect to and I'm not upset about. But more immature people will usually act out and rage all over the forums. So maybe that's it.
---
Look man, this boss always hits like a truck. The tank messed up and it led to him dying. The boss is appropriately tuned.
---
They did a 2nd pull and it was smooth. If he was overtuned then the 2nd pull would have shown it.
---
You are just digging yourself into a hole and getting mad at me for pointing it out.
---
Looks like it will be a separate client.
---
Thanks! I've been bouncing around but it's hard to keep track when you don't follow them.
---
Questhelper didn't come until late late in vanilla iirc, if at all.  
---
I never ran it on any of my 60's in vanilla because it didn't come out until my last one.
---
What I love about this classic launch and how they developed new tech to deal with it, makes me think that they perhaps didnt develop it just for classic for that authentic experience. But also so that they can use it for their live servers and bring some of that unique realm-feeling to a certain point. Nothing is ever created just for one purpose, when you can clearly see it may have multiple uses.  
---
That's how I choose to see it. And the interviews with the devs regarding layering makes me believe in classic even more. All they want is give us the authentic feeling of vanilla, nothing more, nothing less.  
---
It's not on their planned horizon, but they even said in an interview that if there is enough interest and demand, they may make new content for Classic.
---
&gt; no worries just go to another layer.
---
It's not going to be as simple as you are making it out to be. 
---
&gt; brokentooth/Lupos up in my layer 50g for invite!
---
Lupos isn't even going to be a thing. You are barely even paying attention to what's going on in Classic.
---
&gt; wts empty ungoro layer 90g
---
You just seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how layers have been explained thus far. There is not going to be specific layers for specific zones and in general we still lack enough knowledge about how layering works to just make blanket statements.
---
&gt; b-but it's only for a few weeks at the start!
---
If you can't make your argument without mocking the people that disagree with you, you probably aren't making a very good argument. 
---
&gt; implying they won't just turn it back on after the servers shit the bed when they turn it off
---
Server tech has come a long way. Layering isn't for them because their servers can't handle it, it's to give the players a better experience. The servers aren't going to shit the bed, and even in the worst case scenario a queue would be enforced.
---
&gt; You can bet your bottom dollar they'll force it during world boss releases
---
They have already guaranteed that there will only ever be 1 world boss up at a time. They have promised that layering will be completely turned off by then.
---
&gt; It's pretty fucking obvious that they're leaving the door open on purpose for further layering down the line despite what they may say
---
The door is certainly not open. They have made a hard commitment to have layering turned off before world bosses start spawning. Name 1 time blizzard has reneged on a hard commitment. There has been plenty of times where they use wishy washy language to purposely leave the door open for the future. There has never been a time where they made a legit promise and then just backed out on it. 
---
If they had a history of this shit I could understand where you are comming from, but this is just tinfoil hat conspiracy shit at this point. They have consistently honored these types of commitments in the past and there is no reason to think they would break that consistency now.
---
They're two extremely different games and no polling would no work in classic. They haven't even said anything about content after naxx so theres nothing to really vote on.
---
fuck off lol
---
This guy is a fucking tool.
---
Let Blizzard know this guy is a fucking retard. Let them know who they really invited into the beta.
---
You didn't even mention PvP. MoP was the best shape wow pvp has ever been in.
---
Are you dumb? They're **selectively** choosing people with active subs for the beta. Not everyone with an active sub gets in, and you HAVE to re-sub to even sign up for a CHANCE at getting in.
---
Where from my post did you get that I want to play for free? I explicitly said that I'd be fine re-subbing to play, but re-subbing just to be able to sign up for a **chance** at getting in, which 90% won't happen, is ridiculous. 
---
Reading comprehension.
---
Can't see through old water, can with the new water is what they were referring to
---
No, it was cordless...
---
Nope that means quite literally everything as I stated the amount of people trying to get to 60 "**as fast as humanly possible**" is a small amount. As fast as humanly possible would be hitting 60 in a few days. Very few people will do that. End of story.
---
Paly buffs are 15 minutes not 5 btw. Got changed well before 1.12
---
Probably more min/max than not in this case. An NE priest with full world buffs and all consumable would probably lean more to the heavy min/max side than the other, atleast in my perspective. I chose only two options to keep it simple for now but there are of course nuances.
---
Its not free heals, rather your health% stays where it is when stats change.
---
And I will. Nobody is telling you to send money to blizzard. If you don‚Äôt like what they are doing to classic then don‚Äôt play. Quit bitching and moaning about it. Its not going to change shit.
---
Imagine thinking "gloat" is fancy lol
---
Yeah I'm actually scared of this.  They've lost a lot of cred over the last few years.  BFA was imo a disaster.  If they screw this up I fear we will never see that starcraft mmo that I've been waiting for for over a decade.
---
Lol k
---
That is one of the most satisfying kills ever... So good.
---
Maybe it's talking about the token, and even then, it's not "free" because someone else bought the month instead.
---
Apparently to you it is because you can't even use it correctly.
---
You're surprised Activision-Blizzard is doing a money grab?
---
I would like to play it myself, but I have not had an active Sub for a while. I do not like the idea of it being a gamble, so I'm going to do the adult thing and simply not participate.
---
Be real, you know most people aren't there to test it, they just want to play and are treating it as an altered form of early access.
---
They commented that the murloc seemed easier on blizz server.
---
I do remember and counter you with!

Let's say you own a caf√©.        
---
You have a new cookie recipe to hand out as a freebie.           
---
Would you give it to your interested paying customers or the random people outside screaming about not getting the cookies they are owed?
---
"wasn't a full health" he pulled at like 95% hp. lmao that boss can easily 2 shot a tank. it's always been like that. he would've needed hots and precast heals to not get 2 shot right there.
---
Under level 10 has special rules for most things like HP regen, to hit, and even HP per stamina.
---
Maybe in US, in EU it was sold out very fast.
---
I hope my chances are lowered with my sub being paid for by gold.
---
Watch again. I don't think that's the issue /u/ayayalol123 described. As soon as he approaches the mobs, he dodges, gets hit for a white 2 and then white 6.
---
Paladins are the absolute best rank Healers in the game, they  have absolutely 0 mana issues unlike priests/Druids/shamans. 
---
Paladins are the best 5 man tanks because of there ability to easily aoe pull. They do not have a taunt so any boss with a taunt mechanic throws Paladins out the window. All pally tier gear is holy so they do not have viable tank gear and will have mana and aggro issues if you try to run warrior tank boe gear.
---
Retribution Paladins are the absolute worst dps in the game.
---
It's called reading. Top to bottom. Left to right. Group words together in a sentence. Take Tylenol for any headaches. Midol for any cramps.
---
classicsow.live/live has a bunch of streamers
---
I played the tail end of classic like 06-07 when I was like 9-10 and am still playing now..... parents can get their kids into gaming.
---
I mean, just learn to pull and don't be greedy. Once you do that it's slow, not hard.
---
Legion raid frames will be brought over to Classic.  That‚Äôs confirmed.
---
a few people i had grouped with last night were day 1ers   a few were pre-launch alpha/closed/open beta people too.   There were a small number that had said they started in Cata or Wrath.   
---
Before the pitchforks come for me for saying Cata or Wrath people got in,  I'm an open beta pre-launch.
---
k
---
Can you make a screenshoot?
---
They will take the best group available to them, friends included. No one intentionally leads a 39/40 raid when you could bring the moonkin in blues and just not give him gear.
---
It's only my personal opinion but I really hate this kind of thinking.  It's ok to get upset when something you want sells out, and has nothing to do with making someone do something.  When i was complaining about them bringing retail items into Classic several people messaged me about, well no one is making you go out and spend 8000$ on a collector's edition on ebay.  It's ok to not like that you can't get the same thing other people got because of a quirk of fate.
---
College means far more to me now, as a 40 year old, than it did when was I 20.  I dropped out when I was 21 and it was a good decision.  Coming back to college a few years ago to finish my degree has also been a good decision.  I've made plenty of poor ones in the intervening years, but whatever those were I'm in a much better place.  There's no real script to adulthood.
---
It‚Äôs back in stock on EU as of this morning

Reading comprehension....

That's the only thing I can assume, I feel like half the people on this sub don't actually know what current retail is like so they just hate on it as hard as they can without doing any research /s
---
ITT: People who played Wow at 9 years old.
---
TIL WOW was the Pewdiepie of the mid 00s
---
No one cares about ninja looting before level 60.
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
It ticks with the "Server heartbeat" so to speak. The same pulse as energy for rogues and druids in kitty. It's just converted into "per 5" for their maths.
---
It's free to a vast majority of it's sub's I understand someone has to pay for it. However that is called using whales. You can use whales to float any game. If players had to pay for their subs. Of the 6 people I know of that still play. One would continue to play.
---
it's as simple as not getting something that you want.  It would be weird to me that if I went to get some figure at a con or something and it sold out before I reached the front of the line if I didn't feel upset.  Why would someone be happy they couldn't get something they were willing to pay for?
---
Also I think its' not really that butthurt, this is a guess, but I'd say this qualifies as a 2/10 problem for the poster but hey its fun to talk about warcraft.
---
As a 26 year old, I can honestly say I wish I played since launch but I didn‚Äôt...  I was part of the original beta !
---
Please stay on topic, k?
---
Begging for them to be fixed literally while exploiting them to gank opposite faction players.
---
Yeah, streamers get beta because its free advertising.
---
Welcome to Orgrimmar. Have you come to serve the horde?
---
Damn actually true as fuck. High key truths over here.
---
It is if you only play retail and are just clueless about being good at your role (like you said, not pulling early as a tank, having a healer pre-cast / cancel big heals, &amp; dps being on top of killing things fast without pulling).
---
But these concepts are totally lost and irrelevant in retail so it won't be uncommon that these streamers/retail players just suck.
---
There are a lot of live-wow QOL features I like seeing and would love to see in Classic that don't effect the Classic experience. This is one of them. Holding shift to compare gear is also a big one for me.
---
Esfand is definitely the "classic streamer" I dislike the least out of them all. Asmon is funny, though, but if if I'd even consider him a "classic" streamer as much as a general WoW streamer.
---
I hope they invited people dedicated to bug fixing and not just the hype and popularity of being in this beta has created. Specifically people like you that complain the moment you weren‚Äôt invited.
---
I said thru are giving active players a CHANCE, maybe read before jumping to conclusions.  If you don't want to resub, then don't, there is no reason they should give unsubbed people a chance, would increase the pool, and possibly give someone who will never play a beta invite.  Its the smartest way they can do this
---
or a pie
---
I took some years off between my bachelor's and my masters and just finished this past week!
---
Summons, no other of the many reason needed.
---
And if people don't understand this now, they inevitably will after their fourth or fifth dungeon run in classic.
---
How does all that streamer dick taste?
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre too experienced
---
It's a very very small change but I feel like not having it disencourages reserving names a bit?
---
But the people that pay for the tokens are paying 20 bucks per token so blizzard is just making more money if your friends that farm for the tokens really, and if the game is so trash why do they spend the time playing to get the gold and pay for the token in the first place, for anyone with a job it's easier to get 15 bucks in a couple hours of work than it is to earn the 120k gold
---
So?
---
You can even get Kresh's Back that has a ton of armor and a little extra +def to help with higher level bosses like this.
---
Probably had some white garbo shield while being underleveled = rip
---
Well, it can be about being the best. There's some fps streamers that have the personality of a wet noodle but still get thousands of viewers just because of how good they are.
---
Maybe it's Maybelline
---
Sharding fucks with economy more than dead servers do. 
---
It's funny how everyone bad mouths multiple servers like it would kill the game when that system literally made WoW what it was. Sharding wasn't implemented until Cata. Sub numbers show that Cata was the beginning of the end, sharding was certainly one of the major problems. People who think this is a good idea never played Vanilla. I'm cool with hour long queue times, I'm cool with getting kicked for being inactive for a while. Just give me the vanilla experience.
---
No Fucking Changes.
---
August 27 I renew my subscription
---
&gt;most people aren't there to test it, they just want to play and are treating it as an altered form of early access.
---
It's true.
---
Using the mouse after cleaning all the gunk out was fucking orgasmic.
---
Will that work in the new client? I wonder if the mob path finding is slightly different.
---
I'll be leading our raids for the most part and I advertise our guild as "Semi Casual" so take this for what you want. 
---
When it comes to meme specs / off specs that aren't optimal, it is possible to raid with them; however these specs have to try a little bit harder than other specs to stay relevant. (**These are made up numbers**) If we bring a fury warrior that is pulling 600 DPS in MC and a ret pally wants to come and he's pulling 150-200, we're going to replace him. We don't want to gimp our raid because someone wants to play a meme spec. If that ret paladin is pulling 400 DPS and we're clearing content in a reasonable amount of time, sure he can stay, but as soon as we run into issues like DPS is preventing us from killing a boss, or we're taking 2 nights to clear a raid instead of 1 then we'll start looking into replacing people if they're just not playing to their fullest capability.
---
You‚Äôd never be able to live my glorious life. ;)
---
That's definitely a TIL for me.
---
Kinda happy about it, though. I've always had a hate hate haaaate relationship with the default raid/party frames until about WoD. Maybe I won't need addons now lol
---
To bad :( But still, 10k is way more then just vendoring would give :)
---
I hope they ban your accounts now.
---
Same but I was 2 when WoW came out
---
What a piece of garbage
---
The only reason I had any success in Vanilla (at 10yo) is because I played the game with my dad, lol.
---
Eh, considering the level of armor most players have, its like a bear going from psuedo mail to psuedo plate.  Compared to a warrior in mail+shield its about the same.
---
I‚Äôve played enough FF14 and other mmos to make these kind of calls. I don‚Äôt just talk crap about a game because I don‚Äôt like it. Everything I say has meaning and some sort of reason behind it. But I feel you.
---
Anyone see this at any Canadian retailers yet?
---
Not everyone that is gonna play vanilla is diving in face first with the "Lets fuck myself up AGAIN for the next 5 years" attitude. Some people actually can manage a job normally and have healthy gaming habits
---
I'm gonna go back to college to learn a trade at 24, will be done when I'm 28. You're never too old to learn, people!
---

---
Tips ? Race to first 30 ? This is just like Nixxion saying hell get R14. These dudes lol
---
Yes that will grant you access. Their code should still work and if it doesn't contact their support. You will need to put a credit card though but you won't be charged(if I remember correctly) until the free month is over.
---
there were transfers in vanilla
---
heck half the time servers had free transfers
---
It's a combination of getting people hyped for the game, which was to invite lots of streamers, and get good feedback by inviting people who have active subs and accounts that have been around for a long time and have participated in multiple betas.
---
I do think Tip played, but never reached lvl 60. His content is enjoyable at times, but i wouldn't count him as a go to authority when it comes to authenticity.
---
I actually intend to.
---
Education is a life long process. Some people take a long time to finish school. One of my good friends in hs was 17 years old and a junior when I was a 14 year old freshman. He graduated the same year as me. He's far from dumb, he's one of the best strategy gamers I've ever seen. In the years Ive known him he's kicked my ass at chess, yugioh, mtg, checkers, dozens of different board games, and even a game I myself designed. He's just horrible at taking tests. At my old high school you couldn't graduate unless you passed a gradution exam. He failed in 3 years in a row.
---
For good players that are still "used" to playing vanilla it will be trivial. 
---
To someone rushing in mindlessly without any form of communication from retail it won't.
---
L2play or wipe.  The way it should be.
---
Are you a big streamer or influencer?
---
Human Warlock because I don't need the internet's recommendation on how to play a character I enjoy. I know how to think for myself and don't need to be told what to do.
---
Yep, IQ translates to Armor in Vanilla. 
---
Looks like it'd adversely effect performance while gaming...
---
I've seen tons of people complain about it, typically with the reasoning that "everyone should see the world in the exact same way" even though that's literally never been a thing.
---
I'm guessing a lot of people will or already do feel the same way, hype may have got the best of us.
---
Pottery.
---
added to original comment
---
I think the base game is free (quit in WoD), so you only need the sub, no activation needed.
---
Just let it go bro u cant do anything about it
---
The truth sometimes hurts.
---
Asmongold is a living, breathing shitpost
---
Once you accept that you understand.
---
$$$ though
---
I guess his sarcasm went straight past you?
---
As others have pointed out, this isn't the WoW "Classic" Collector's Edition, it is the 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition.  With that said, if you're US you may have a chance.  I kept a close eye on a few retailers yesterday and Amazon briefly had them up and I was able to preorder one in the 5 or so minutes they were available.  I still haven't seen them pop on Best Buy, so, assuming they are actually getting some and I just didn't miss the window there, maybe keep an eye on their page.
---
Bobby Kotick probably cares about your opinion.
---
Is it not possible he did the quest in WOTLK and is referring back to that? I was there when he watched this video live and he never said he for scarab Lord, just that he did the quests
---
No... I don't even watch twitch streams :(
---
We invented wireless internet, eat me
---
Tauren range in general is messed up right now. https://clips.twitch.tv/DeadTiredHareOhMyDog
---
Rip
---
Why do you deserve a chance over the people who have been/are already actively subbed?
---
Just to shove some input into this conversation: On OSRS you need a certain total level which requires some time to get. In Classic, that could be like "You can't vote without 10 days played on your character", for post-Naxx content etc.
---
I'm not sharing my standpoint on if it should be in the game, just adding some more info into the discussion.
---
That's a little harsh... Just the way I like my vanilla
---
lmao @ these fucking retard streamers
---
Good job you took the bait.
---
Can the mods ban this guy too? Its clearely u/ cuuuuuuuuu from the other day.  
---
Downvote and move on.
---
An option would be fine but I would prefer this along with you.
---
This is God-Tier.
---
FOR THE HORDE

&gt;"Its not my fault, its the game fault for being too hard!"

Retail plebs.
---
Oh really? I never noticed that in new wow, but I havent really pvp'd in new wow. I am sorry I didn't realize.
---
Nice job man idk how you did it
---
I'm very #nochanges but I am really OCD about my character list and I hope this stays.
---
He was quite clearly fucking joking. Thanks for contributing to this subreddit with your outstanding post.
---
I know, I read your comment.  I'm saying what you experienced is not typical, because Stratholme (including "Live") offers a lot of targets for Exorcism.
---
You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?
---
&gt; Quit bitching and moaning about it. Its not going to change shit.
---
This is literally the same response that people would give to people asking for classic.
---
My eldest kid was born 2007 
---
He killed me as I quested with him on my arm (catform sneaking through a cave) and he stretched out hit 2( attack) and whopping 6mobs swarmed me.   
---
This time around he is 12 and will play with me :)
---
Would you give it to loyal customers or people who were loyal customers 10 years and hate your company? 
---
People are dumb. ‚ÄúI DESERVE IT MORE THAN YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS!!!‚Äù
---
Hard to ignore them when they‚Äôre plastered on the front page of WoW Twitch.
---
They specifically said they are keeping multi item attachments to mail even though that wasn't in Vanilla, "because add-ons could handle that anyway".
---
You can certainly point it out, but it might be intended to keep it.
---
lol, on his stream he just said "I don't want to level with someone else because, honestly, I don't want to talk to someone for like 30 hours" ... while he is talking to a stream while leveling for the past 24 hours.

Lol see that's how you know you're awesome. I revert my previous comment. Give this man BETA!!
---
The whole reason I want to play classic again is to NOT min/max. I rushed at launch to keep up with friends and I regret not enjoying the quests and lore on my way to 60.
---
Classic Wow will be my zen this time around, not a 2^nd  job.
---
Are you sure? I thought you had to have an active sub to get into any of the other betas.
---
&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if it was this way on classic or not ‚Äú .....then why are you making a video as if you‚Äôre an expert
---
Give me a break. So you know every single detail of a game you played 15 years ago? If that's the case then I guess Blizzard can shut down their reference computer and just ask you.
---
Asmond is a good entertainer, but yeah he's more of a "generic" wow streamer than specifically a "Classic WoW' streamer.
---
It was fun watching him get tossed in Dark Souls tho.
---
#nochanges!!!!
---
Soda isnt that good tho, from what ive seen. 4h is about right for a really shit group
---
This is something I was hoping for. Nice.
---
The mental gymnastics you people will go through to justify #changes. We get it, you *don't want classic*.
---
See these are people that should be beta testing. Not fuckin people who report bosses for doing too much damage because they're fuckin retarded and don't know how to tank.
---
You can't really afford constant respecs. You stick with one spec and it may not be perfect for both PvP and PvE but that's ok. When you change specs it's because it'll be something you stick with for a while.
---
I played in 06 when I was 14 and went to college when I was 21 and just graduated a few days ago. Not *that* much of a stretch.
---
THANK YOU I wanted this as soon as I saw the wallpaper. That was quick!
---
So is it in your opinion better to have only positively attuned participants in beta?
---
We‚Äôre talking the general difficulty of raiding as a whole, not only the top tier of content. With that mythic can‚Äôt be the baseline, just as Naxx can‚Äôt be. They are completed by far too few for it to be fair when discussing raiding as a whole.
---
Many of the mechanics in CoS are reimaginings of old mechanics, which we‚Äôve see loads of times before. Only in mythic (which again isn‚Äôt the baseline) has the mechanics that have only been seen a few times before (ex: star augur marks). The core is still ‚Äústay out of puddles, don‚Äôt stand in swirlies, kick the adds‚Äù.
---
I heard all of these came with expansions. Lets keep it that way and add Argus along with the BFA raids and dungeons.
---
All I did was put a screenie through [an online photo editor](https://www142.lunapic.com/editor/) :)
---
yes yes no
---
dont think you will have a great time trying to grind as a holy paladin
---
There were realm transfers in vanilla.
---
**P R E A C H**

What do you expect? This is a guy who started in Cata, he has no idea how grouping pre-lfd is supposed to work. Honestly sick of this fraud.

Play retail for 1 minute.
---
You know, I think we‚Äôve started off on the wrong foot. Let‚Äôs try again.
---
I like the dungeons in FFXIV. For me, they are a pro. They are not the same kinds of dungeons as in WoW, so you have to approach them differently. If that type of gameplay doesn‚Äôt appeal to you, then it doesn‚Äôt. And I do like the community in FFXIV. It takes a little more effort to join in because it‚Äôs not forced on you like the RAID OR DIE!!! mentality of some other MMOs, but it is there. So for me, FFXIV is some magical place. Not perfect, but still magical.
---
I also like the dungeons in WoW, not because they are hard, but for the sense of exploration. If you have a competent team with good tactics, the risk of death in a WoW dungeon is not appreciably higher than in FFXIV. You avoid patrols, LoS the adds, tab-sunder for threat, etc. You could argue it‚Äôs more mechanically involved than an FFXIV pull, but it comes just as naturally if you know what you‚Äôre doing. I will disagree on the community aspect in WoW; since dungeons are optional, it‚Äôs actually easier to treat WoW as a single-player game. More than once, I‚Äôve outleveled a dungeon I wanted to run simply because I was out questing. The roulette and level sync systems in FFXIV, combined with storyline-required dungeons, actively encourages you to engage with the community. And with linkshells, you can join communities outside your free company (guild) with shared interests. Way back when I played Vanilla, I rarely interacted with anyone outside my guild. And nothing in the game really encouraged me to.
---
That‚Äôs separate from the current retail version of WoW, of course. Leveling dungeons are no better and often significantly worse than the FFXIV dungeons you dislike; randoms want to pop in, burn down, get loot, and get out. Anything which interferes with that process gets flamed mercilessly and generally leads to instant ragequits. The community there is... less than ideal, and is one of the major cons of the retail game. That and the use of RNG to create an endless loot treadmill designed to retain subs above all else.
---
I want to see WoW Classic succeed. It has things FFXIV does not.
---
I want FFXIV to continue succeeding. It has things WoW does not.
---
Both games benefit from the other existing. Game devs have gone on record saying they were inspired by combat mechanics and encounter design from the other side. It could be argued that WoW has stagnated because it went so long without a true competitor. You can also argue that the direction retail WoW has taken is a direct result of them trying to adopt FFXIV‚Äôs game model without understanding the philosophy behind that model. WoW needs to go back to what originally made it a great game. What made WoW great, though, is fundamentally different from what makes FFXIV great. They are both great games aimed at very different audiences.
---
This thread started because someone thinks WoW will steal FFXIV‚Äôs base and destroy the game. FFXIV isn‚Äôt even competing. They just want to make a fun game. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù or ‚Äúlosing;‚Äù having options means we ALL win.
---
One of the smartest things Blizz is doing is holding off til August. That means that everyone will have a chance to play through the story, get geared up, and even the World First Savage race will be over. The casuals which are FFXIV‚Äôs primary audience will keep playing it. The hardcores who want difficult content will jump to Classic. There will be a significant overlap population who plays both. And that should keep both games alive and thriving.
---
you said, **people who think its FUN**. Again, the popularity of speed running streams and guides online for the most optimal leveling routes proves you wrong. End of story.
---
Nice try, troll.

Bro I know a guy who burned 25k playing looney tunes world of madness. Then he quit a month later. You can't explain whales. As far as the 6 people I know who still play. They don't put out any effort into making gold. They all just have fucking dragon hordes of it because they have been playing for a long time. I am sure some people still like the game. That being said a vast majority of people still playing MMORPG's have been waiting for many expansions now. For someone to put wow out of their misery. As to why they still play when they don't like the game. I have no idea.
---
i would like that aswell, or atleast a really long CD on char trans (so a ninjalooter can only come back after 6-12months with a different name)  
---
but they were there in vanilla, so there is no arguing with all no-changes-people, even if it would enhance the classic experience imo
---
WTB shitstorms 50MSK
---
Thats about how long it took back then. Deal with it or play retail.
---
Lol no
---
It depends on warrior level. 
---
16-18 you kite
---
Lvl 20+ and decent shield and healer tank. 
---
It‚Äôs more common to have a low level tank
---
In 2019, Hunter names are any variation of "Jon Snow."
---
like 90% sure troll lol
---
It‚Äôs +75% chance. And tips doesn‚Äôt have that extra defense from the turtle shield, so he probably has like a 7% chance, making it 82% for 5 seconds, 1 attack. But you can also time it better than tips here, and get 2 melee swings on you in those 2 seconds to guarantee it will proc.

I dropped into his stream last night when he was in Durotar killing quillboars. He teamed up with a random warlock killing quillboars until they got to a chest and tips straight up ninjas the chest, no /random or anything. Says after the fact "oh shit i ninjad that," but continues on regardless until the warlock opens the trade window to give Tips a sword that dropped, then Tips gives him some of the loot out of the chest finally. Dude nearly had to have his dick twisted just to share some level 5 loot.
---
Shit my dumb ass is paying for a sub I don't use rn so I can get in the beta.
---
Yeah, only 95% accurate, obviously it's a completely different game :\^)
---
I also saw another change today! There was a little red arrow thing when the player was on a flight path mount so you could get off the next spot instead of picking where you were initially flying, this wasnt in vanilla..
---
WHATS NEXT LFR?
---
I want that old janky texture that I know and love. The rest of the graphics options I'll probably crank up.
---
The water texture is just right in that uncanny valley. Its just "too" glossy, too calm and too plastic looking.
---
That's the best part about classic! Just making meaningful upgrades if the are BiS or not
---
love it, thanks
---
This is the last thing we should be complaining about. Layering is the biggest of them all. T wasn‚Äôt in the FUCKING game back in 2004-2005 so take that fucking shit and shove it up your ASS Blizzard!
---
"New reputation factions and rewards can be found in these new zones. Can adventurers unlock the Mysteries of Uldum?    
---
Can groups of adventurers defeat the ancient monsters of Hyjal?     
---
Rewards and fun await players who desire a challenge!"
---
I did too! And became a high school dropout.
---
No, it is a fallacy to disprove an argument because a small irrelevant fact is wrong. It is not a fallacy to claim that making a part of your argument wrong shows its unlikely the rest is accurate. But thank you for not knowing what you are talking about, I hope you actually read up your fallacies next time.
---
No . I was admittedly a very casual noob who played so little I didn‚Äôt hit 60 until TBC released . I also don‚Äôt upload videos pretending I know about the content either sir .
---
Didn't play in 04 but I started in 07, when I was 4.
---
Why is Jaina's hair white
---
Ok. Might be worth a watch just to see.
---
As in you both played together each on your own account? If so, you got a pretty cool dad :)
---
Well you didn't say the locations, you just said "Raggy, Onyxia..."
---
As long as you pick up some int gear.
---
You can just swap it in when you need it.
---
Pre 50 or so.....you can realistically so whatever you want if you just have the right gear for the job.
---
But the closer you get to 60 the more people will want you to have a more reliable build.
---
You could do a good 50/50 ret holy build. Thats what i do when i level. Also...if you get to like...40? You can do a prot holy build. And heal and aoe grind.
---
The 3-12 week range is scary but otherwise I agree this is an ok solution for friendly zones.
---
For neutral zones layering is a real problem... game breaking but It wont stop me from playing of course.
---
lol, the down votes. This is MMO history folks. Some blizz dudes who are now devs said something similar to the Everquest devs long ago.
---
Horde paladin you say...
---
You can go hybrid holy ret or holy pvp and heal with no issues up to aq 40 , it is then that a full holy will make a difference
---
So while there might be a perfect holy pvp spec and a perfect holy pve spec, I‚Äôll be able to find one spec that does ‚Äúgood‚Äù in both pvp and pve and be just fine?
---
Yes, I remember that he actually could hit you for half your life.

Cool story.

unfortunately offline mode works only for the bnet client, your character still appears online in guild rosters or when doing /who! mystery alt characters nobody knows the name of is the only way to "really" hide when appearing offline.

This list is terrible.

It‚Äôs the FoV. Definitely needs changed

*role  
---
Warrior. I like the feeling of be integral to the success of a party/raid. Tanks are the key element you can't do without, and warriors get the best toys.
---
It's a fucking beta
---
Did that in Cataclysm.
---
Holy shit I needed this. Thank you Kargoz!
---
I went on Twitch today to watch 5-10min of beta. I just picked the most popular stream at the time. The chat was the most retarded thing I've ever witnessed. WTF is even happening.
---
Turned that shit off in a heartbeat. I'll wait for Soupa's videos!
---
"High level bosses await skilled fighters in the Caverns of Time.   
---
Will players invest the time to acquire the needed resistances to defeat these temporal monsters?"
---
They mean swap to the set after combat, while walking, regen, then swap back before you get back into combat.
---
I had to explain to Tips that blocking a hamstring, rend, or gouge was possible in original and it stopped the effect from applying.
---
I considered not uploading this because the other thread got a lot of hateful comments. Please don't hate too much on streamers/youtubers. I uploaded this because his facial expressions are very funny, and the moment shows that even experienced private server players can be surprised and fail in classic. I don't particularly like "tips out baby" either, but I think we all know by now in this sub that some people don't like him.
---
Fuck off with your anti private server circle jerk. That boss hits just as hard on pservers. This just is just an idiot. The healer was also an idiot and dpsing during the pull.
---
A hear a lot of it's just beta, it's limited, who cares it's all going to be deleted, but I always thought how you act when it doesn't matter it indicative of how you act when it does.
---
I‚Äôll be 26 next year when I (finally) get my undergraduate degree. I feel so far behind everyone from my Highschool, but then I think how only a few people from my family have even attended college and how I‚Äôm still pretty young... yeah life isn‚Äôt that bad. Do whatever you want at your own pace and just live your life.
---
&gt;reporting bugs is literally the whole point of a beta... 
---
Player feedback and marketing, mostly. Actual bug reporting is obviously something that should be done if you encounter bugs, but that's not why Blizzard has beta tests like this.
---
That turned out great! /s

Personally I would much rather have this stay updated. The vanilla way only served to be an annoyance. Especially when considering you sometimes trade in multiple quest items for multiple rewards.
---
I do
---
Played since beta. Met the love of my life over WoW but she was in another country. We dated long distance for a couple years before I went aspens stayed with her in Canada for a couple months then she came down to California with me. 
---
10/10 would classic again
---
IT.
---
Software development is going to grind to a halt in early September.
---
Personally, I LOVE the updated shadows, lightning and ground clutter. It just makes the game feel more vibrant while still looking "classic". It's great!
---
fair enough, I'll report it with another title
---
can you substantiate your claim that blizzard won't address a variety of bugs and reports? Can you provide details on that process?
---
You‚Äôre kidding right?
---
https://i.imgur.com/MuTR9O7.png
---
People like Joana didn't get invited because they don't brink 70k troglodytes like Sodapopin and Asmongold do.
---
What about "I pretend to be a min/maxer on reddit because I like to posture myself as Elune's gift to gaming but when I actually play classic I'll wind up in a garbage tier guild blaming everyone else for sucking."
---
That should be an option.
---
People have already said this.
---
Lies and heresy.  I disregard your reality and substitute my own.
---
Shes turning 19 now, and will fight you.  I wouldn't want to face her vicious mockery.  She's killed with that shit.
---
Doesn't do you any good though :)
---
There will be no ganking this early lol.  Level 20 gonna run to the Barrens and try to gank level 12's?
---
Thrall will not lead the horde though it would be cool if he did. The only way I see Thrall taking throne is if Saurfang dies in their battle VS Sylvanas
---
Most if the big streamers are rushing. Few are actually testing shit, MVPs right there.
---
Wow, seriously? Fuck you tips.
---
A lot of strong contenders for the most dumb post of the day but this one gets my vote.
---
You have a perceived level of popularity for guides you've concluded in your mind. I'm telling you the numbers will show a small minority of people will get to 60 in the time those guides intent for people to get to 60 in. It's not that big of a deal to be wrong, honestly.
---
fuck me lol they were trolling around a lot, people are so keen to hate
---
Really who needs WoW when we can complain?
---
Exactly.
---
Why give it to two undeserving millionaires when there's actual vanilla vets who could provide good feedback.
---
When he just foreplays with you but then you feel his dick's about to enter your butt
---
I think it's the best video game movie out there. Though that isn't saying much.
---
I'm in no rush to 60 and will take my time, as I always have, to get great gear along the way, keep my professions leveled, and take time to help guildies complete hard quests.   
---
I'll run a dungeon 10 times if I must to get weps and armor that will make the next 10 levels less excruciating.
---
Most people who are beta testing are big streamers anyways. I saw tips put a bug report in for a boss in WC doing too much damage when half his gear was broken lol.
---
Just seen an ‚ÄúEU‚Äù streamer so there must be EU invites, only US servers??
---
Warrior is by far the best class in vanilla, they only really struggle when solo
---
Right? So dumb people want to start changing Classic but only in ways they see fit
---
Because it makes sense, they've been practicing the routes on private servers in order to prepare to practice because that is all they had available. Now that real is available ofc they're going to be compared.
---
Really glad to see this. I'm 24 and am just now about to finish my associates degree. Felt mixed feelings about it as well as going on to continue my bachelor's
---
They invited a lot of pserver people to test it as much as possible.
---
So what is the point of his videos ?
---
So is their plan to never allow Joana to play classic...? Brilliant theory!
---
Yeah, no... this dude hits like a truck on Private servers. He‚Äôs notorious for being a chunky boi. They‚Äôre just being sloppy and idiots here.
---
If you get a lesser magic wand and go right at 4 after imp and corruption you should be fine until 10 :)
---
I wonder how feasible it would be to duo level yourself (as in have to accounts, in my case a War and Priest).  Could be kind of fun if all the first groups are going to be duo levelers.
---
Remove vowels as needed.
---
I love learning new words
---
Dad?
---
In that video I think he mean't the quest return arrows on the minimap which were a thing in Vanilla. Otherwise there's no quest markers.
---
That's true. I didn't mean to imply that they aren't receptive to feedback, just that they aren't interested in having a back and forth argument with the player base about it.
---
cant handle twitch chat maybe.
---
Ok that explains why Blizzard isn't inviting Vanilla Vets and just gave out keys to streamers hmm?
---
Vanilla Vets would be able to tell you if its legit Classic or not
---
The pserver guys barrel through stuff because their hardcore.   Casuals don't go to the trouble of figuring out how to play on private servers (not that it's complicated - they just don't have an interest).
---
While Pserver players may have to re-learn some things in Classic, they'll gonna barrel through things just as easily still.
---
I still can't believe Twitch is even a thing. I remember hearing about it and thinking about how stupid it is.
---
I mean yeah, I would definitely be interested in watching professional CS, or Dota, or other eSports. 
---
The best are the "hot" chicks on Twitch that play games and are god awful but virgins sit there and provide them with an actual livable source of income.
---
No. Fucking. Joke. The little wheels were sooooo bad.
---
So? Private servers get a lot of things wrong.
---
This is a type of hasty generalization fallacy. I took a logic class as a general elective and you learn about all the different types of fallacies. There's not just a single kind.
---
Have you considered that the people who have played 10+ years of classic private servers haven't actually been playing true vanilla either? Just as close to vanilla as possible.
---
After spending 10 years playing a "simulation" of vanilla anyone would feel like that is the correct version when in fact it may not be. Stop tin foil hatting and wait until we get a completed version that you can experience yourself.
---
OR blizzard doesn't want guide makers to make guides that will let people level up quickly. They rather people just wander off and be subscribed for 2 months more than usual. Thats my tinfoil hat
---
Marketing.
---
Yeah, but it only works in pairs. Otherwise you are just a guy called Offhand.
---
There are a lot of differences that were in vanilla but not on private servers, many mobs had spells in vanilla that they didn't have on private servers, how often they cast them etc.
---
After Chuck Norris left the Virgin Islands, they were just called the Islands.
---
If a Warrior gets crit for 400, a Druid ought to take similar damage then.
---
&gt;Why give it to two undeserving millionaires when there's actual vanilla vets who could provide good feedback.
---
Because they are trying to hype it. They are a company that needs to make money
---
The wave yesterday had  2000 people in it. So remove all the streamers from that number and you are left with 1900 + people actually testing. 
---
Stop being salty.
---
Yes, it's a good thing. It's just a observation? Why the aggressive tone
---
i guess my understanding of alpha testing isn't well informed.  
---
I thought they would at least notice something like this, i mean, anyone playing it at all should have noticed this.
---
They're not stupid.
---
Do you think they would nerf something just based on the report? They will check if that's correct.
---
It wastes them time though.
---
These formulas likely still get pulled out of a database.
---
Mage, warlock, warrior... choose the class you like. I‚Äôm sure blizzard will find a way to balance the classes after some time.
---
Agreed some people are so blinded by their jealousy the topics coming out of them are absurd lol
---
Yes, I had a current subscription with BFA, but last time I logged on was in January.
---
#YEAH BUT LAYERING IS THE BEST SOLUTION GUYS *draws infograph mental gymastics*
---
Me too. He is the best content creator for Classic.
---
Yeah, like Windows since 3.x
---
Good thing you're not important, byee
---
Yep, this is a lot of my thought.
---
I kind of want to be a warlock, but even in Wrath i remember soul shards being kind of annoying, and honestly lack of soulwell just sounds like it'd be hell.
---
The other major factor is that i want to play a Dwarf, so its pretty much Pally or Priest.  
---
Priest just seems to look more like what i 'want' to play.
---
I heard staysafe say something similar like half an hour ago.  I think some kind of tool is gonna be put in place but really don't think it will be that big a deal.
---
Maybe but we don't necessarily know that's the case. This is the first time they've publicized the fact that you need a subscription, likely because this time they know there will be a very large group of unsubscribed people who are interested.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve been a tips fan from the start of his channel, and I‚Äôm unsubbing today. Reporting a bug because you made a mistake is just a new level of sad.
---
Easy to say that on the internet. I'm not entitled and I'm not a kid. It's classic. The default settings should be classic.
---
Born in 93. Played in 05-08. Started college in 2014. Working full time while taking part time classes to not have to take out loans on GE/AA/AT classes. Im currently 26 (well I'm 26 in 5 days) and have about 2 more years of schooling before I can graduate if I continue part time classes.
---
I think its more common than not for students to rely on working while going to school to not go into lifelong debt which causes many to take longer than usual. Also school doesn't have an age cap to it, you don't need to start college right out of highschool to progress in life. I dont understand why its surprising that many people who played in 04 are still in school.
---
The Classic team definitely does know that the transition from modern MMOs to Classic will be a big adjustment for a majority of the population.
---
 For instance, MP5 rule for healers is the opposite of healer gameplay in at least one leading modern MMO. In that one (final fantasy), healers are shamed if they're not acting like secondary dps and dpsing in any downtime. The metric for a "good healer" becomes how little you can actually heal, pushing dps.
---
I am very pleased that healers will actually be praised for being good, smart healers in Classic, the way it ought to be.
---
Arms Warrior wrecked rogues like no other due to Overpower and dodges and as a Fury Warrior, i routinely melted warlocks outside onyxia's lair cause they always thought they could fear me and they learned the hard way when i'd pop berserker rage.
---
I dOnT wAtCh aNy oF tHeSE sTrEaMeRs. Yet here you are, gobbling on their dicks. Also nice projection.
---
Bro a vast majority of us have played on private servers. There are no glasses. I understand why you would feel that way but, the reason why we love the game is actually really simple. 
---
Firstly classic is a far more accessible game. I know that sounds crazy but it is. My 54 year old mother can casually raid in classic. She can't in retail. Raid Finder is awful for casuals because even though it's easier. You don't make any friends doing it. So my mom won't do it. Raiding alone is no fun.
---
Moving on from that. Every class feels distinct because, they haven't been homogenized chasing balance. In classic you can actually tell a lot about a persons personality based on the class they chose. Also you can't play the entire game from Orggrimar.
---
I think Classic can easily be improved upon. That being said. They haven't done that. Not for a vast majority of people. When they drop classic you are going to see people playing you would never have  imagined would play. The reason being is that classic wow isn't like playing a game. It's like inhabiting an avatar while you visit another world. Classic wow appeals to non-gamers in a way retail simply can't.
---
But im sure he values your opinion and wants to know why! Also i am 100% serious, just like r/turfa10
---
If Nathan doesn't get more glory soon I'm gonna be pissed. He's done 10x more for the Horde than Sylvanas has this expansion.
---
Wouldn't they get hit by AOE easier? Also are shouts based off your characters center or your outer hitbox? I would assume it's your center, but if that's the case you would need to move your hitbox closer to others to get your AOE to hit them.
---
Think about trying to get out of fire or blizzard when you have a larger hit box. If it was focused on your character center it would take longer to move out of it wouldn't it?
---
I mean, I have a communications degree with a psychology minor. I have thoroughly studied this, please actually learn this then come back and prove me wrong.
---
Tips started in Cata. The more you know.
---
If you didn‚Äôt need an active subscription we would know. It would posted everywhere.
---
So who should be testing then? The streamers who don't know shit either apparently? Obviously everything isn't 100% correct on the beta because they're down porting it from retail for God's sake. Either way there's going to be a lot of guess work unless blizz outs out their reference client then we can really get down to business.
---
warlocks are really good for their utility, they're strong enough but I hated soul shard farming.
---
It seems to me that if they are providing an option for legacy graphics settings, then they could also provide a FoV conversion.
---
&gt;Questie
---
I would hope that the Wholly/Grain or QuestCompletist adding could be available with updated data. The ones that query the server for completed quests.
---
Makes not much sense, blizzard invited normal ppl which are old vanilla gamer. So why should blizzard block ‚Äûcontent creators‚Äú which have the same exp. at the end it‚Äôs the same, ppl which share their exp.
---
Honestly I wouldn't worry about what's op and not. If you hate playing the class and it's op, you're going to hate playing. It's not easy and quick to reroll like retail.
---
Play what you find fun. Warrior is most "op" technically in vanilla. It's limitations are solo leveling, reliant on gear, and over population.
---
You are thick, aren't you?
---
As I suspected they have not given us Original Spell Batching.
---
To everyone who has posted that they've confirmed this you've sadly missed the entirety of the post.
---
They have not given us original spell batching but rather Post Cata Mechanics. Check out Perplexity's stream to see what I'm talking about.
---
 Id guess most of these "veterans" have played on private servers and think that's real vanilla
---
Graduate school is a thing
---
Elaborate?
---
Just reading 'HP buff" and remembering that small tid just spiked that excitement reaction lol
---
Nah fam, you right 100%. The change in ideals in this sub are night and day from last year.
---
can't the mods just make a rule against all these people just linking twitch clips with no info?
---
We‚Äôre all nerds, man
---
It wasn‚Äôt bad
---
There are plenty of streamers that also didn't get invites. 
---
They are invites after all, you should get off your high horse and realize you're not that important. Don't be so entitled and you won't be so let down.
---
He also maxed out persuasion!
---
At this point they only want promotion. 
---
Literally less than a month ago they Activision Blizzard invited professional football players to check out the latest Call of Duty, not even game journalists, but these guys.
---
Not that I don't believe you, but I'd love to see a clip of that.
---
The last point goes for esfand, staysafe and asmongold too.
---
Charge switch dot,want switch back, probably pretty easy just a lot of apm unless you have some multibox setup.
---
When a player keeps trying to hurry things up and fail the gap jump, that's when you know.
---
Most op spell in the game :) it‚Äôs a huge advantage we get it at launch this time.
---
The mental retardation that people fall victim to when they think layering is some holy grail of an idea when it's literally repackaging the sharding idea. Oh, and it's not just being using for launch but on demand from now on. 100% they shard that AQ event a year from now, but they said they never were going to use it past Phase 1 remember?  
---
Go do some research on the promises of corporations that weren't legally binding and how much they give a fuck to hold a candle to it. Layering/Sharding is now here to stay forever because we've come to accept sub-par quality. It's sad really.
---
White Knighting for streamers, good try bud!
---
What is that? I'm not really accusing you of any of this, or at least I didn't intend to. It just sparked some musing. For the record, I am very glad you got a colorblind mode.
---
Also a Mac user - but I use a 2014 mini w/ an egpu setup. The mini‚Äôs finally got refreshed last fall, and appear to be beasts of a machine for their price(in Mac terms anyway haha). Easy upgrade for less than $1,000 which should be more than capable of running classic
---
I don‚Äôt think return arrows were a thing in Vanilla either.
---
You might have gotten them with addons....
---
Judging from the success of some streamers, or twitch as platform in general, I'm guessing that it actually is entertaining.
---
No xp bonus at launch please.
---
Yeah i was 11 also, I was so shitty back then but i loved every single second of my time in Azeroth
---
Personally I'm for a cool down of like say 30 minutes.  You can join groups fairly often when questing but can't dodge that rouge if he decides to layer jump just to fuck with you.  A middle ground is usually best imo
---
Cool, thank you!
---
I admit that my chemical engineering degree has little to do with logical fallacies, but even your tone and elitist choice of wording is biased by your generalizations not just against the op of this thread but against me as well. Please get some self-awareness
---
Chop it off. Eunuchs make the best no-lifers.
---
Yea, it isn't toxicity it was justified anger.
---
Yeah sure dude, level 60 farming black lotus with other level 60's partying you to different layers in 2 weeks. Good luck with that.
---
Multi-boxing is very feasable and can be very strong; however it relies on some third party software to manage the multiple characters. I've been tempted to try it out with a priest/hunter, it sounds like a perfect combo for 0-downtime.
---
Wow, then it must never happen then, because your experience is the center of the Universe.
---
Is classic going to have classic graphics? It doesn't bother me either way but I could understand why they would give it a HD pass or something.
---
They're fielding new tech with classic. While you're probably right, I personally wouldn't take PTO's on that kind of chance :)
---
To be honest: my hope is to keep the server communities alive!    
---
TBC and WOTLK will split and fracture the servers.    
---
TBC was the beginning of the end of WOW.     
---
This isn't mental gymnastics.   
---
I want classic to stay classic.    
---
Classic WAS A PHILOSOPHY NOT A SET OF GEAR AND ZONES.    
---
TBC changed the philosophy.
---
Na only horde -.-
---
Yes I'm fine if they bring back the vanilla CE edition pets or not (even though I have vanilla CE), I wouldn't be upset either way.  
---
Same with my original 100% speed mount, I have that on live still but whether they release them in classic, let us purchase them or keep them out is up to them. 
---
I understand that things sell out, i guess I was more just being sad about it on a forum then anything...
---
Warrior mains. As a tank these are amazing early.
---
Yea the rush to 30 is fucking pathetic.
---
&gt; context is really important here.

Mechanically, IMO, fun as hell.
---
Kill it slowly via Affliction
---
Nuke it down via Destruction
---
Demonology you are a Hunter in Robes but without all the cool toys.
---
It took a lot of knowledge though in PvP to be great. i was average in PvP at best but was able to get Senior Sargent title when they announced they were taking those away. Thats when I started the PvP on him.
---
As for PvE, you are a better farmer than Hunters as you never have to go restock ammo. Only thing you have to stop for is emptying bags.
---
I miss the pre-cast dance
---
I genuinely can't tell if this is serious or not.
---
Nice try but nobody is hating on these guys because they "play a way you don't like". Calm down.
---
Are there people actually stupid enough to think private servers are accurate replications of vanilla? Nothing on those servers are accurate.
---
Yeah this isn't going to stop me from enjoying the game, it's really not a big problem in the grand scheme of things but it is something I wanted and completely missed out on which made me sad.
---
I can tell you suggested some pain-in-the-ass things to investigate.  Whether you were trolling or genuine, I think people will be finding themselves in these types of situations at some point. I might as well see what happens.
---
This chart is sort of designed exactly for people like you, then. The point is to show how someone's approach to leveling (on a spectrum from pretty casual to pretty hardcore) will work out with their timing goals. This can be useful once we have phase schedules to know if your approach lines up with your goals for raiding, if any. For example, if we find out that phase 1 is 12 weeks long, and someone wants to raid or clear MC before phase 1 is over, they'll at least have an idea of how hardcore a mindset they need to reach max level in time and get in there.
---
&gt; Going to enjoy destroying all the fotm private server kids that roll warrior
---
*laughs in Rank 1 Frostbolt spam*
---
Hitman, though.
---
How is the pet pathing?
---
That's a big fat
---
 #no
---
so changes?
---
glad i'm not the only one who noticed it
---
One other quick note - what version is your MacOS? It sounds like classic will also require 64 bit, so you may be forced to upgrade from a software standpoint anyway
---
Nobody was bitching and moaning for classic lmao. I think your definition of ‚Äúbitching and moaning‚Äù differs from mine.
---
Doubt it. That will likely come with phase II beta testing, id assume.
---
wow i haven't seen this in years, but this was definitely one of my favorites. i used to watch it all the time!
---
All the upvotes
---
Wallpaper engine pauses when anything is running infront of it. It's incredibly lightweight
---
Yep. Gotta figure out what adjustments to make. Luckily, the route shouldn't be too different. Just gotta do some more quests or possibly grind more. Just gotta figure out how much.
---

---
wtf no changes!
---
Private server players are useless for beta.   That's like having a ex Ed teacher that is a virgin, but has mastered masturbation.   It's useless feedback.
---
Streamers get invites because it generates attention to the game.   They want more people to know.   Like I didn't know about classic until about 3 months ago.  Thats why streamers get invites 
---
They don't need feedback like.   "Hey bro, I can't spam only world buffs.".  Hey bro, I was a fury tank and kill raged in dungeon blues, now he's killing me, wtf."
---
Because private servers aren't blizzard servers, and that's what they care about.
---
Guy is a perpetual joke in every sense of the word. A true turd furgeson.
---
Do?
---
When did we find out that it changed from 7.3.5 to 8.0?
---
Kargoz is one of my fav classic YouTubers
---
I don‚Äôt want to hear the truth ):
---
getting my bachelor's in June, perfect timing to nolife this.
---
Warlock's are not OP.
---
In early raid content, they will usually be less DPS than a mage. In later content then they are about the same, perhaps slightly better than a mage (ignoring skill).
---
In PvP, they have better survivability than a Mage but a Mage can usually out-DPS a PvP spec Warlock, assuming the mage gets their cast off before dying.
---
In terms of raid utility, they are probably more useful than a mage. A mage has poly, food/water, and an intellect buff. But the warlock brings various curses that are vital.
---
I'm not playing warlock vs mage here, personally I'll be playing a warlock, but they are not OP.
---
Hehe now I feel bad. But it would be funny and interesting to see you doing this things.
---
Overall, garbage, but if you've been a fan of the series for a long time, it's probably worth a watch, just to see everything realized.
---
if world of roguecraft taught me anything its the starting weapons are fine
---
Entirely possible and even likely.
---
You know people sometimes go back to college in their later years, right? Like what is continuing education my guy?
---
I fell asleep in a WC a week ago because it was really late, and we still got it done in less than 2h with escort kill.
---
Nah ‚Äòlike‚Äô
---
I hate tips but his deep dives are actually great. At least the rogue and warrior ones are.
---
I think this is to prove them wrong.
---
For real?  That's hilarious if true.
---
Betas are such a clusterfuck, I'll never do one after being in the warhammer online beta. I remember people constantly whining in that one that a class was overpowered due to an ability that literally did not work.
---
Oh my b, I read your comment as a meta-criticism
---
Are there people actually stupid enough to make that assumption?
---
Not to mention they all watch twitch which influences their minds, WHILE DONATING TO THEM PAYING FOR IT
---
"Hey guys whos your fav streamer btw I hate Tips. Anyone else here hate Tips? God Tips is awful. What was this thread about again?"
---
If you just wana make a thread to shoutout how much you dislike Tips, go ahead, but why are you trying to pretend you are here to shed light on streamers you like when it's obvious by your responses here you just wana let everyone know how much you hate Tips.

A workplace, especially at a large headquarters where most people will remain as strangers, is not a social group. That's my whole point. My social groups, the people I hang with, share a lot of what interests me, and even if they don't, we still coexist with no drama. What I'm suggesting against is essentially going up to strangers and saying "hey, ya heard of this digital cocaine called wow classic". Learn to read.

Hell yes baby I'm all over the professor plums!
---
Every streamer I've seen has been reporting bugs like crazy. Ive seen sodapoppin report at least 20, and even saw him testing the tauren hitboxes just like in this video.
---
Private server kids stay salty.
---
Yes, this video looks very correct. Definitely working as intended. And so is regen. The people that have been researching this for 10+ years know can't possibly know more than the average pleb that just became interested in classic 5 weeks ago. Those people know what's up. We better trust their 'memory' instead of knowledge based on tons of video evidence of the real thing.
---
Ok, thanks for responding. Enjoy the beta!
---
Don't love or hate tips but I also plan on getting lost in WC, and I bet a lot of other people will too.
---
1 hour and 47 minutes.
---
Hey moron, you are completely missing his point. Blizzard is asking for an active subscription for a game that is from 15 years ago and nowhere close to the current expansion in exchange for a raffle ticket for the beta. I didn‚Äôt sub because of this. I don‚Äôt need to throw away 15 bucks for a slim chance at looking at the beta version of an old game I‚Äôve played many times. Sure I‚Äôd love to check it out but I‚Äôm not just handing them potentially free money. And yes I have a job I just don‚Äôt piss away money for stupid shit.
---
He‚Äôs brought that up multiple times and I‚Äôm like this is the hill you‚Äôre going to die on? I seriously don‚Äôt even remember if that‚Äôs a thing...why does it matter?
---
It's completely possible to expressed justified anger in a toxic and over the top way.
---
NO DONT LISTEN TO HIM
---
NOCHANGES
---
Same here, pretty much word for word.  Joined on day 2 of initial release, subbed on and off, all expansions, have a current subscription (but haven't played since January) not a streamer or creator of any sort.  Got the invite.
---
It's just that tips out is that much of a massive douchebag, he's not even worth memes.
---
Favourite: probably Countdown to classic
---
I like Joshs open discussions, good interviews, lore etc it's a good variety that breaks the mould of what you see with other creators. He mostly does podcasts but you can find him on twitch too, it's for more mature audiences who likes to critique subjects. 
---
Least favourite: tipsout
---
Absolute joke of a creator. 
---
Couldn't even get an exclusive interview right without a shit camera angle, poor production quality, sound quality and talking about taking drugs. Not to mention the fact he can't even abide by an NDA and his lazy regurgitated unoriginal content (e.g. 12 reasons to play wow classic)
---
Can you explain yourself? Loot trading in 5mans could easily single-handedly ruin the community aspect of this game, in my opinion. No one would run dungeons outside of an immediate group of trusted friends, and there goes the community feel
---
Saw this and thought I would create an image for the Alliance counterpart, can be found here -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpf7zx/alliance\_rogue\_sword\_progression/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpf7zx/alliance_rogue_sword_progression/)
---
And people say private server players shouldn't test the game.
---
I think having the whole game converted with proper polish is a bit different than hacking in a few models. :)
---
In any case, I'm not Blizzard, I'll leave it to them. But as I said, I seriously doubt they'll touch Classic after release (the planned content rollout and bugfixing excepted). The reasonable choice for them is to bring the expansions.
---
The only ones who have a backup of ‚Äúreal ‚Äú data is blizzard , so yeah
---
a niner? were you callin from a walkie talkie?
---
One can only hope that they would not nerf, but who knows what they are thinking about. On its face, based on reports in this thread the bug report seems to be a bit over the top.
---
Code setup in the bug report system
---
If report = *streamer user list*
---
Dump
---
I'm just sad Frostitute is going to be taken by the early reservation (jk I wasn't going to play mage anyway.)
---
Ya but *who cares* and *why do you care*? Just don't watch the guy
---
Tips is a known idiot and isnt "most streamers".
---
Asmongold, sodapoppin, staysafe, and shroud were literally reporting bugs like every 20 minutes last night.
---
Yeah I agree with you, Blizz has the real values, and if this was the way it was way back then I hope they keep it that way.
---
tbc is not vanilla
---
where's the vanilla clip verifying this range? 
---
it appears wrong
---
No thunderfury?
---
You've actually been able to do that by logging of. This caused you to drop down at the next point so there's not much of a difference. Still, I believe it shouldn't be there for another bit of vanilla feeling.
---
Bye
---
This list is so bad it hurts. First off going swords all the way is fine but there is zero reason to pigeon hole yourself into one weapon type while leveling especially when you can not even put points into Sword Spec until level 30.  (Can't even train swords until level 10 as Horde.)
---
I was going to show my list but fuck it, go figure it out for yourselves. To me thats where the fun is instead of following some drones list.
---
There's a video on r/classicwow right now from one of the twitch streamers stream clips of them dying to a dungeon boss, go look at the comments, people could not be more hyped about dying in a dungeon lol
---
Umm thrashblade on a mage is OP
---
You\* are the plague.
---
This is correct, thats why you go female tauren if you plan to PvP as a druid on horde side.
---
I‚Äôve seen one or two from Kargoz . He wasn‚Äôt for me , but not annoying either . Asmongold seems too much about money then love of the game
---
Bite the pillow, I‚Äôm goin in dry!
---
Correct.
---
It doesn‚Äôt show weapon stats apart from dps, and it has all the items just listed based on level requirement. Plenty of the weapons on this list are noticeably stronger than others further down, but someone new who would actually use a list like this may not know that.
---
No it‚Äôs stupid. They are basically saying ‚Äúhey community that requested this game Bc they hate our current one, u can resub to our shitty games you hate for a SLIM CHANCE at trying out the beta for the game you‚Äôve waited for years‚Äù. Lol fuck that. When ur turning back the clock 15 years it‚Äôs not the same as playing a direct expansion beta from the current game ur playing that is VERY similar. Most people who want classic wow play zero retail wow.
---
What are you talking about man? He‚Äôs played thousands of hours on private servers. Those dont have lfd either
---
As I understand it, female Tauren has the same sized hitbox as male. Is this incorrect?
---
It's a generic term to encompass the streamers people are complaining about getting in over Joana. Trade Fortnite for any other popular game and the point stands.
---
That's cool, keeps both parties happy.
---
Yup, like others I've never streamed or had a youtube channel, I played Vanilla and been in every expansion, had an on and off sub and yes I'm currently subbed as I usually just get the 1 year sub instead of monthly, and I got an invite yesterday.   The only thing I've done that may have helped is I've had Beta access to many of the expansions and I actively bug test, fill out the forms and send stuff up.   Maybe my account has been flagged as someone who actively bug hunts.  This is completely speculation on my part, but who knows.
---
Did he go over Shield Block? :V
---
Does me a lotta good lmao, I couldn‚Äôt even legally own most of my cars in the majority of European countries
---
Idk I checked my self, at early levels it seems similar but in Joana videos the regen speed really went down a lot past lvl 5/10, which deosn't seem to be the case in the beta
---
Can you determine if reputation values for quests are correct and if the expected 25% spillover reputation to other factions is implemented in the Beta? And if so, at what point does spillover rep start (from the very first quest or not until after the newbie zones) and stop (honored, revered, half way through one or the other)? Also, could you skip a few quests that you know give rep and see if they give reduced or no rep when you go back and complete them as gray quests?
---
Ideally, it would be great if you could list a few quests in each level range and how much rep they give at what level (both to the main faction and the amount of spillover rep to the other factions).
---
Says in the bottom right corner for each slide "BoE Green drops not included*"
---
tips is such a poser
---
Kargoz has a ton of these for each class.  Check out his youtube, I liked them enough to make a playlist of all the class guide that I'll play in the background sometimes.
---
i played vanilla but not pservers 
---
if i said something was different all the fan boys would tell me im wrong or it does not matter anyway lol
---
It really is not at all the same thing tho
---
By all means, the pserver guys are going to be the most prepared out of the lot of us. However, they will experience some changes to the game that weren‚Äôt on pservers.
---
Underwater breath timers seem way too long?
---
Any streamer on twitch right now.
---
14~ hours sounds way closer to what i remember being able to accomplish in vanilla. 8 hours to hit level 20? sounds fast af. in vanilla 1-20 was your whole day.
---
The first wave was the streamers to build hype. Friends and family invites haven't even gone out yet. Patience.
---
Preach it brother!

There's a lot of threads on this topic, and this has been removed as it's both a repost and misinformed: You can be selected for the beta without being subscribed, but you cannot access it without being subscribed. The article was poorly worded, however several people who are not subscribed did access the beta.

Assuming you mean for warrior, Kargoz put together a similar presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HyCiVeKMS9MDOHxEHyDH38i0q2kJD-3qjSMxFjTZk8k/edit?usp=sharing).
---
I laughed, and I promise no roasting from me.
---
I'm sensitive to that sort of thing, get really frustrated when people play badly or whatever. But I was watching Sloots stream yesterday (retail streamer), and despite him having no plan whatsoever and pretty much just running around doing random quests, I didn't get that feeling at all. I think because he was continually min-maxing how he did things as he learnt/remembered new things. So pretty much the opposite of what you describe with Staysafe. I guess good WoW players are good players regardless of expansion, and only because you have experience might not necessarily mean you play well.
---
This isn't super useful.
---
"Hey blue BoEs are worth something" yeah, no, that's not really a surprise to anyone. 
---
What would be useful is walking through *common* drops that are worth something. e.g. leather armor "of the monkey", cloth "of the whale", key green wands with decent DPS/level, key green ranged weapons with decent DPS/level, or marking out what weapon DPS is "good" and might actually sell on the AH at different levels.
---
Listing stuff like deviate scale belt and saying "oh hey this is worth something" is like, yeah, no shit... And you'd probably get as much/more gold just selling the mats, the recipe is free with an easy quest to all leatherworkers.
---
To entertain and inform people, and based on his viewership and subscription numbers he seems to be doing an alright job of that.
---
So you‚Äôre all in on this beta? Will you even play the finished product in August or will you be done on 08/26?
---
Im not playing now because I know I'll burn out b4 classic happens if in unlucky
---
VC was that moment in Vanilla where I went from "this is just a game" to "Hold my calls."
---
Jumping on the wheel for safety was a part of that run.
---
Yeah apparently your definition is "anything I don't like."
---
If you come around redridge at 20 you'll get your shit pushed in
---
He's been hitting the gym in his self exile.
---
????????????
---
The dream comp
---
i dont know what "Advertising " they would need exactly. 
---
Everybody knows when the games coming out and how to play it.
---
Melee range seems to be bigger, also hitboxes are different i think
---
They did it during wod iirc. In the settings, they had a checkbox for "improved player models" or something like that. I'd be perfectly happy with that so long as I get to experience classic with classic graphics on my end.
---
Underated comment. 
---
Adult nerds, please stand up!
---
Irony is majority of people who played vanilla private servers never touched retail vanilla. Yet they cry at a minor bug, cringey
---
it is a bug and been in since the demo. blizzard has a bluepost from vanilla showing the exp rates and 2 player exp is too high
---
And this is why Tips probablu doesn‚Äôt care. He knows he has people that will defend him and still group with him regardless of if he acts like a dick or not. Hell, a lot of those people will probably encourage it and act like him.
---
Quality &gt; quantity. I bet devs have go through hundreds of ‚Äùthis is broken‚Äù reports with 0 value
---
His a tauren.... did u play vanilla
---
Yeah same with beta
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousDirtyOryxNomNom](https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousDirtyOryxNomNom)
---
Can't remember how it compares but doesn't seem that bad.
---
Do combat rogues in vanilla use slow MH/slow OH? Or slow MH/fast OH?
---
I was at university when I started playing in vanilla and I actually still am... apparently there is a PhD in there in somewhere but not much else has changed, lol
---
I'd give asmon a pass because he doesnt make classic guides etc
---
Okay but again, the only non-wow streamer Ive seen playing is Shroud. Who exactly are you talking about?
---
If he's averaging 2k viewers per stream he's making a shitload of cash, probably in the 40-60k a year range. More if you add on whatever he makes from youtube.
---
Jokes aside, he actually seems nice a pretty friendly dude and is a lot less cringelord than some of the other foreveraloners like Asmongold etc.
---
Dang i came to comment this :P
---
I love the look of the Night elf character models in classic, think they are my favourite.  Ill be going horde though
---
Sorry DownvoteMeYouPeasant. You're arguments with facts and logic are too strong for my weak and feeble brain.
---
Pserver values aren‚Äôt correct, your statement is invalid.
---
Two mice doesn't give you two mouse cursors, or let you have two different active windows.
---
The third party program is so that your macros will affect different windows of WoW, not just the one you have up. There is no way in the base game to do that, you would need to manually click over to the other window or alt-tab each time you wanted to do something on the other character.
---
No BG's until phase 3.
---
The who list in vanilla capped out at 50 people. It didn't display every single person online the way pservers do.
---
Breaking News:
---
This kind of makes me want to watch the whole stream.
---
Idk, Tips was on the edge for me. This pushes me over the edge.
---
Exactly, he‚Äôs a Tauren, not an Undead. But no, I never played Vanilla when it was current content.
---
Are people getting offended by players looking for bugs or what? So fucking weird this community sometimes man. They are looking for bugs to help the game, ITS A BETA. They are not attacking you.
---
&gt;You don‚Äôt have to turn the other cheek, just don‚Äôt pay him any mind
---
i agree with you, but just a heads up, paying him no mind is literally turning the other cheek.
---
Turrible. 
---
JK, I think it‚Äôs good, it may be missing something from the mid levels, and it‚Äôs not listing pre-raid BiS swords from Rend, which is fine. That belongs on a pre-raid BiS list, not this one.
---
&gt; Now if it was someone like Asmongold I would expect more out of him since he pretty much only plays WoW.
---
To be fair, Asmongold is known to be shit at the game, he's pretty much the representative of the "casual" crowd in retail. Mostly running around collecting mounts and transmog and stuff.
---
Sounds about right if your questing. Grinding was always superior on vanilla, Not so much on private servers.

Apologies for it been a WoWhead link, but I think this needs to be shared, and I don't think anyone posted it already.
---
If they did, don't worry just link me the previous post so I can check and I'll delete this one.
---
It just hit me after reading this, that the twitch gaming scene is just the Soap Operas that dumb people get caught up in.  The fact anyone would defend or oppose some noobs running Wailing Caverns in a 15 year old game, in a closed beta, really drives the point home.
---
LoL...."vanilla vets"
---
Lol, no, I literally did not know what an addon was until I started raiding about a year after first playing WoW, no joke.  People kept telling me to get a threat meter, and I had no idea what they were talking about, and I didn't want to ask.  If I had to guess, most people that played during Vanilla, pre-AQ did not use addons.
---
It's a small beta where they are trying to market the game to people with big WoW audiences and trying to find some bugs. I really want to play the game too but people just need to go hit the gym or hang with some friends and come back in a few months. I love Warcraft to death but at the end of the day it is just a game.
---
Lol private server experience =/= vanilla experience.
---
The entertainment part ; fine . Different strokes for different folks . I understand what I find entertaining some don‚Äôt and vice versa . The information? At least make sure you really have accurate info or skip that area all together. If we‚Äôre saying off viewers that you‚Äôre good than Esfand and his ret pally are leet . For entertaining content I watch the likes of SoupaSoaka who admits ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad , but I have fun ‚Äú and has an entertaining channel .
---
You cant train weapons until level 10 which is a good start to why this list is bad.
---
1. Yes, make sure to be collecting int/spirit gear as offspec healing gear. Going full ret while leveling is fine up until about early/mid 50's depending on the rest of the group. 
---
2. There's _ideal_ specs that perform slightly better in each kind of content. But there are hybrid one size fits most specs that will do good enough for your needs.
---
3. Prot/holy can farm pretty okay if you get the gear for it.
---
You are here to spread hate. Nothing more.
---
&gt; I couldn‚Äôt continue to watch any of TipsOutBaby
---
&gt; makes me want to kill myself
---
&gt;*Least favorite is Tips*. Glad I‚Äôm not alone in this thinking lol
---
&gt; over the likes of Tips and that asshat Esfand
---
&gt; Just overall seems a little corny and not entertaining
---
&gt; I guess because people keep watching therefore he keeps getting paid.
---
&gt; I also don‚Äôt upload videos pretending I know about the content either sir
---
&gt; So what is the point of his videos ?
---
&gt;  yes Tips is horrible
---
Link worked for me, turns out im a little after release, I'm sure plenty of people share the same date as me :)
---
https://i.imgur.com/3N8f3m9.png
---
&gt; The wave yesterday had 2000 people in it. 
---
I really doubt that considering the server seems to have like at most 50-100 people online according to streamer's /whos
---
Who is Joana and why do I care?
---
Its not only streamers? My buddy is playing as we speak.
---
Ohhh, that makes total sense.  If I do it I'll go the sketch option and just play on a shit laptop combined with my normal setup, I have a duo monitor so I'll pipe it thru that.  I'm sure the third party option if way more eficent but this way I'll be able to play while I go poop or take a 10 min Netflix break (joking of course).  Not sure if I will or not but I might.
---
People like you are so weird, the sort to hit 60 and bank level 20s to 30s. Awkward as fuck because you know you‚Äôre dead against a 60, so you need to kill lower levels. I‚Äôll never understand how people can be that bad.
---
You absolutely do not need to be specced to tank/heal for lowbie dungeons, but you do need to not absolutely suck at the game.
---
Nathaniel Blightcaller. We're on a first name basis.
---
I'll come out and say I never played Vanilla WoW. Started in Burning Crusade, but BC is a hell of a lot closer to Vanilla than current iterations of WoW.
---
Vanilla was the beginning of the end of wow
---
You are dumb af. You can resub once you get the ticket. Why would I resub without any product guarantee? I‚Äôm not paying $15 for potentially nothing. I haven‚Äôt played retail wow since 2007.
---
The point was caring more about sub count, so if anything he is top of the list.
---
Looks pretty legit, don't think it was more intense before.
---
Are you streaming / have a discord?
---
You generally want a fast OH for poison application/white damage.
---
Wait, am I the only person that remembers it this way?  It was never an even split...  You always got slightly more experience than you would splitting the solo experience in half.  Are we 100% sure it wasn't like this in vanilla?
---
Rule 3: Be civil and respectful.
---
That overstates the permanence of the layers. They can be dynamically created or destroyed (not exactly correct technical term) as needed. It's may also be easier to imagine it turning the entire world into an instance that holds one server's worth of people.
---
Sure did, raids in cata were pretty awesome

While I can respect that not everything in bfa is garbage, good cinematics and graphics on a bad game, to me, is like putting a super gourmet gravy across a cheap steak.
---
the dude from the clip isn't against it actually.
---
What r u talking about? I‚Äôll resub on 8/26 when I can actually guarantee myself the ability to play the game. I‚Äôm not shelling out 45 dollars over the next three months for nothing....
---
Nice. I am looking forward to seeing old Menethil Harbor. I spent too much time fishing there.
---
lol not really actually I just use university online since most of the rest of the world does.
---
&gt;a lot of people act like they are perfect 1:1
---
I dare you to find a single person who has said that on this subreddit ever.
---
Many of the twitch streamers are private server veterans though.
---
Also, RELAX, it's day 2. Beta invites are ongoing and continual, more roll out each day. Just keep checking your bnet launcher and I bet all of us will gain access eventually during the next few weeks.
---
You have to opt-in for the beta. The beta opt-in was made available the day before yesterday.
---
Unless I fall over dead from a heart attack or a stroke, I'd say the likelihood of me suddenly going inactive is astronomically small.
---
As a healer in Vanilla, anyone can eat a bag of dicks if you pull fast.
---
I‚Äôd generally heal everyone except the person who pulled and wipe the group on purpose if needed.
---
Everything you get is in plain sight. 
---
They don't need to justify anything to you. You are getting what you see and if $99 is worth it to you, then that is your choice. 
---
Apparently it's worth it to alot of people because it sold out in a few hours.
---
Mad season is sooooo good.  I love his videos about his memories of WoW Vanilla, and the series he did on famous and infamous players.   It's were I learned some lady sold sex for a flying mount.  SOLD SEX FOR A FUCKING MOUNT!
---
If two groups want a product, and the former group is already being served, would the latter being served by gettibg a product they want, cinsidered gatekeeping? Youre misusing the term. 
---
In retail certain values and design philosophies are being held, and in classic others are. I sont agree with this "everyone should have a say" narrative youre painting; this was never intended to be for that group. Why cant people enjoy the product as it was intended to be?
---
Also, way to go conveniently brushing aside the other 85% of my comment
---
Platinum WoW, Frostadamus, Classic Winds and MadSeasonShow are tied for my favorite.

Agreed, see a lot of beta footage that's sort of negative/"not classic" in tone.  I get it, some is sort of discouraging but it's a beta and that's the exact purpose of it so hopefully they're making the most of this time and looking to polish things.  If beta were completely polished they wouldn't be waiting 3 months
---
He is a living(debatable) manifestation of an actual turd.
---
I agree. That is until I need to go to get zumbabwa's head (or whatever the fuck his name is) die to about a billion trolls and tigers with some rapters sprinkled in.
---
Yeah, its better to have people with no experience in vanilla from either retail or pservers in instead.
---
Sure I get the argument that pservers might have been different, especally when it comes to specific number values, but again the priate server playtesters have also been referening these issues for a long time in order to simulate them in the first place, to discover what "seems right".
---
Its not like they made everything completely custom, it was suppose to simulate vanilla so a lot of things should be almost identical.
---
Yeah I hope so too :)
---
Ultimately a good warlock will outdps and average mage, but skill scales with gear so an ‚Äúequally skilled‚Äù mage should normally be outperforming a warlock until later content.
---
Just play on a PvE server if you're scared
---
This ain't a cry post. It's just something I found funny.
---
&gt; The vanilla way only served to be an annoyance. 
---
Bag management is a part of the RPG experience; an annoying part, but a part. It forces decision making. When you have to choose between Stringy Red Meat and Single Linen Cloth to dispose, you give value to one over the other. It also changes how you might use that item later.
---
Notably, Skyrim did a great job with this. The weight limit would be reached quickly and you have to decide what has priority and what doesn't - all the way down to wheels of cheese and bear claws. 
---
So yes, you're right it's an annoyance, but one that should be there rather than not.
---
Then I suggest you wait till August to resub, you know ... when it releases.  Even us active subscribers don't have beta invites.

---
I played warrior in vanilla. Like early vanilla. My recollection of warriors is vastly different than 1.12 warriors.
---
Sweeping strikes is in the wrong tree guys....
---
To clarify, you still have classic animations, models, etc in Classic regardless if you toggle that setting on or off. Turning on the "Classic" setting just rolls back some lighting and texture updates built into the current client, to the original Vanilla lighting and textures. As well as some other settings IIRC, like max view distance, and "grass" density.
---
/u/huskeruk
---
I‚Äôm not offended, I find it funny that people instead of reporting bugs, go out of there way to try to validate shitty private servers by bashing minor bugs that classic has, floating about them in fact. Yikes dude.
---
yeah I would for sure say there's room for both types for sure

What can you expect from activision. They only sellout for streamers with highest views.
---
Haha yes I remember that from years ago . Out of the 5-6 ppl I‚Äôve seen more than a video from , I like him quite a bit . Kind of sounds nerdy but funny at the same time . Guess he‚Äôs got the favorite spot currently .
---
I'm not sure if this was mentioned here but, given the game is based off the newer engine im assuming this means the client will put more stress on the PC than the original game.
---
The only reason i ask is because currently my wife uses my old PC to play on a a private server with me.. hopefully that PC can run WoW Classic so she will still play!

This looks so good to me.
---
Who is the streamer? Because the only way you dies in dungeons is if you are so experienced in retail leveling that you just don't expect to not be able to pull half the instance. If you take it one pack at a time. You should not be wiping. I mean you can wipe but, it's not super common.
---
A voice of reason, I hear.  Downvotes, I sense.
---
I mean I was in 1st grade when I started playing . Got my own account in 2nd  If I went to college right after high school I'd be graduating next year
---
keep your feet underground
---
&gt; People with 10+ year of vanilla private experience 
---
you mean private server experience? which has a lot of differences to the actual vanilla client, which only blizzard has access to?  
---
fuck, that post really is the dumbest thing ive heard here and ive been discussing layering with non-informed apes for 48 hours now
---
Asmon is under the guise of a vanilla player, but he only played for a few months before BC came out, so it's no surprise really but I think he gets a leave pass because of his persona .. not much of an excuse is present for anyone else though
---
It appears that none of them coordinated with each other and all just went warrior.
---
Not bait, this is an honest question: don't we still know the formulas to figure out HP/MP regen based on spirit, or have they become unreliable? Should be something that could be tested mathematically over a range of levels (assuming someone in beta is willing to do it)
---
Username checks out.

I have done the same. For past Betas. Like some have said I think it‚Äôs a combination of factors.

I noticed this too! I miss how the old text seemed slower, and how long a crit would sticky!

Emoticon?  You mean emoji grandpa?

Someone else mentioned Frost . I saw him on the ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù tab last night so I‚Äôll look into him !

I laffed.  U should too.  I was watching live this morning and listening to soda bitch was hilarious.  Stop taking everything so seriously guys.  Lighten up

I think it was soda but I could be wrong
---
Literally nothing this guy could ever do to beat me, there‚Äôs no reason to go pve because I‚Äôll be 60 months before him. You know the type, you probably are one to sit in stv ganking low levels, then a 60 comes along and puts you in your place. You know the feeling.
---

---
Please tell me there‚Äôs a video. These guys raging is seriously making my day!
---
No worries, this is great news and thanks for sharing!
---
Because some people don't want to realise that the world has changed since 2004.
---
crap fart!
---
There are a lot. A lot of people believe that pservers are actually accurate and will end up more accurate than classic (it won‚Äôt).
---
What tree is Tipsout going down? Arms or Fury?
---
I don't have access to the beta, and although private servers aren't 100% females on them have had like 1 yard smaller hitbox, on top of that certain WSG jumps have been easier. can effectively just run through obstacles others can't if ur a real tryhard u should go for female in pvp. but don't quote me on this probably wait until late beta to see if they change something
---
This isn't from the movie, it's from this: [https://youtu.be/umAgdVTBae0](https://youtu.be/umAgdVTBae0)
---
What‚Äôs funny is those who insist the graphics be shitty polygons are most likely not going to be playing on a crappy pc with 2004 specs. I mean, no changes right? I think shitty dial up Internet should be all such people are allowed to use too.
---
That could be bad memory. Blizz literally have a reference build and aren‚Äôt going by memory.
---
who is doing that?
---
Because this is a marketing endeavor you cuck, stop complaining.
---
We try to, but have to turn to them for beta news and content....double edged sword.
---
Did he get off just after this? 24 hour stream at this point wow
---
Not surprised, private server rates have always been fucky
---
I don't really like or dislike him in particular. 
---
My issue is with you and the disingenuous nature of this thread. You are posting under the guise of pretending to have little to no knowledge of the classic streaming community when in actuality you are just here to shit on a particular streamer you dislike because he made an outro that annoys you. Grow the fuck up. 
---
If you don't like it, turn it off.
---
Hopefully, just seeing some of the beta posts there seem to be a lot of negative posts rather than critical/feedback.
---
TBH why does it matter, I don't mind the guy but he is not very knowledgeable if you are trying to see which is better.
---
Yeah maybe, poorly worded. I meant it more as to just don‚Äôt get riled up and pay him more attention, as opposed to just ignore him. Get your point
---
For longer dungeons, like gnomergan, people would jump over certain ledges and land deeper in the dungeon essentially skipping a portion of the dungeon. Unfortunately, pets don't jump and they'll run through the whole dungeon normally to catch up to you bringing with them every mob in the dungeon they aggroed. To prevent this, warlocks and hunters need to dismiss their pets before they jump.
---
I mean in scandinavia, where im from, it's not uncommon to take 1-3 years off after high school to work and save up to buy an apartment or travel before you start college. The average Swede take their bachelors degree at 28 and start studying at 24 and we're not even in the top 5 in Europe.
---
Let‚Äôs pretend your statement is true . That makes you a hypocrite does it not ? If you don‚Äôt like my post , scroll on .
---
I do t think you understood what they just said
---
Or, just take level 20's and not have to deal with it and clear the instance faster.
---
Yes! That‚Äôs truly awesome!!!!
---
WELL, THE BOSS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS SPELL BATCHINGS
---
Its a marketing initiative man....is this what the sub is gunna be like until launch? Just shut the fuck up. I thought the BS posts would end once the beta came out. Guess not.
---
The tank and healer are completely out of range of each other.  Sure, the healer shouldn't be stacked on top of the DPS, but that was ridiculous.
---
Yeah, it'll work for looking at base regen though at least.
---
my kind of player
---
although this doesn't look like foothills (i think that was the name)...and lets be honest, that's where the real fighting happened.
---
eitherway I can't wait, battlegrounds killed the enjoyment of pvp servers almost overnight.
---
[Yessss!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/yes/yesjacknicholson.gif)
---
Bud i started in '06 because of my dad. I was six then. It really isn't to far fetched to have people that have played classic and are still in school
---
Private servers were significantly easier. ‚ÄúVanilla vets‚Äù who earned their stripes in the simulations are in for a shock.
---
&gt; Twitch is stupidly profitable even with a small amount of viewers. I remember reading that even averaging 100 or so viewers per stream makes you enough money to live off of, on average.
---
Do you happen to remember where you read that? I'd be really interested in the source.
---
Docken. He streams pservers on YouTube until the release. Pretty chill dude.
---
Two shitstorms, 75 MSK. Shitstorm very fresh, just picked this morning!
---
Maybe I've never made the trip before. Frankly it was a joke. I am all for ganking but, shit I'm not walking that far lol.
---
This makes me wonder how charge works. Does it leave you ontop of your opponent or does it only bring you to the edge of melee range? If it's the later then you'll end up further away from your target if your warrior is a tauren.

---
The art of pulling mobs 1 at a time I‚Äôm a cave or crowded area is actually pretty hard.
---
I get it, I wouldn‚Äôt do it either, I just don‚Äôt like the hate train, for me it would just ruin the experience more to take part in actively hating someone opposed to just ignoring them. 
---
I also feel context is valuable in this exact scenario. It‚Äôs not like it was done out of malice or was important in any way. It‚Äôs more like a douchey joke.

I used to have an egg timer going next to me when playing on the computer so I could share with my brothers. There were multiple VC runs early on where I had to sneakily increase the timer without anyone seeing. But completing it the first time gave me similar feels to beating a dungeon in Ocarina of Time for the first time.

I graduate from medical school next week and played soon after launch in middle school. So... its a thing.
---
Ya man that's exactly what's he said almost word for word...
---
Working as intended
---
Ha ha yea Soda is a Cata kid. He won't be wiping too much once he realizes you can't face check half the instance. Don't get me wrong classic dungeons are harder then retails easiest onese but, they arent "hard."
---
Stockades are easy.  
---
As long as your taking it slowly pulling one room at a time fighting by entrance.  As runners pulling adds is what kills most groups 
---
The end boss tho hit hard but can be burned down fast.

Zoiii-oioioioioioioiiiiii

The anti content creator hate in this thread is fucking hilarious. Yall are really this mad over a fucking WC item in a closed beta with a level cap? Holy shit
---

To be honest - its a system which also needs to be tested ;)
---

---
I disagree becuase sharding or layering as they call it now is inately disruptive to a community since your literally fracturing the community from the get go. Ive already said it numerous times on this reddit but id prefer a half full server that doesnt have any fractured community over a full one patchworked together.
---
Either way ultimately all i want is an option. If im wrong they can destroy my server, ill accept it and re roll no complaints i just have enough faith in the community that actually wants classic and will stick with it to pick no sharding over sharding.
---
It‚Äôs still pretty damn fast, I normally do 1-20 in 14 hours on a warrior. Average player is 1-20 in 20-24 hours.
---
Or they could reward loyal subscribers with a chance at beta. Everyone can play classic when it releases, beta isn't something you are entitled to be a part of. They could just as easily have done no beta.
---
Retail is 99.99999999% faceroll 30 iq content and 0.000000000001% mythic raiding.
---
Classic is far better balanced.
---
Is the boss supposed to be flying around?
---
Sure....
---
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre back. Make Wetlands Wet again.
---
A reminder from the comments: The UI of it is good, but the actual BiS pieces are not accurate depending on the spec/phase/ability to actually get rare drops and more.
---
Good idea, needs more accurate info/secondary choices.
---
This right here. 
---
With the exception of SFK (only because I love that instance so much) I'll probably run each dungeon just once to say I did it and call it a day. 
---
Of course, my SO is going to be healing so if she wants to run more to practice along the way that's fine, but I'm not going to be running the same instance multiple times for an item that'll get replaced relatively soon (before 60).
---
It‚Äôs me your brother
---
Ok?  It's not "2004/5".
---
I bet I could still get kicked.
---
My favorite Tauren name I've ever seen is Eetmorchikin.
---
It's impossible to prove a negative, and are prob right.  I think one of the reasons people are upset are how some of these same streamers said SUPER negative stuff about classic over the years and are now falling all over themselves to GET DEM VIEWS.  I saw SUPER negative stuff about Tradechat (who I personally love her videos) just cause she said stuff about vanilla players that she later apologized about!  Have fun with the BETA (no matter how jealous I am :)
---
Blizzard has been whitelisting streamers for early access for some time now. It's not a big deal. They serve their purpose. Invite waves will continue to go out over the next three months. Plenty of testing will get done.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Yea, usually an associates takes about 2 years. It took me 7.
---
There's a few popular dungeon routes that involve jumping off platforms to skip trash packs, most common one being jumping off the balcony in UBRS into Rend's arena. Warlock &amp; Hunter pets will run through the dungeon geography to catch up to you, since they have no ability to jump. So a few seconds after everyone jumps down, a pet will come running through the normal entrance followed by every trash mob it aggro'd between the jump point &amp; where you landed. Usually ends in a party wipe and getting yelled at. Dismissing your pet &amp; resummoning after the jump avoids the issue.
---
Same with me but I was in the army.
---
...varian‚Äôs army.
---
Downvotes...definitely butthurt fan boys lurking.
---
But what if your friend is in a guild that's currently on a different layer than your guild?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fine. I think you in general should be a bit more aware of context in this situation. It was a group of 5 streamers/friends of streamers who were obviously joking around. 
---
It‚Äôs by no standard a big deal, at all. That‚Äôs what I mean by people looking for a reason to hate him. There‚Äôs plenty legitimate reasons to not like him or any other streamers, actively sowing hate is a poor excuse for building community or having fun, in my opinion. 
---
To each their own
---
No, alliance did not have shamans at all.

If I were him, I probably would've gotten off \*during\* this. It looks so good.

Does the beta really only last 2days? Where is this said?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8engm3/realistically_how_much_can_you_expect_to_make/
---
Top comment from this thread. It's anecdotal, but that's pretty much the most accurate way to measure twitch revenue because Twitch doesn't publish any numbers and it would be stupid for bigger streamers to because then people feel less inclined to donate. 
---
A streamer who has a channel that averages about 100 viewers per stream says he generally gets enough donations to add up to 24k a year.
---

Hey i played back in 2004 but im back in school today at 32yo
---
You can see in both this vid, and the tank POV vid posted, that no, he wasn't.
---
(you can also see in that vid that he got hit for 202, then crit for 405, but that had the healer been close enough and healing, he had enough hp to survive)
---
A lot of people in here are making the argument for "it's technically possible" 
---
When the reality is there's just a lot of young people that want the old school cred and you can't prove them wrong, so they lie.
---
4 of them if you're lucky enough to get ~~layer~~ laier 1.

Did you say...

Entry level position. 30+ Years experience required.

I don't think any of them are actually trying to speed level.  They're just playing and enjoying themselves.  You wouldn't do WC if you were speed leveling.

They must be trolling, Shaman is horde only in Classic.
---
That's exciting, having a community will be amazing and I'm excited for all the things I miss from wrath before lfg and things like that, but I can't see myself getting home after a long day and wanting to sit and grind 30% of a level vs doing a high level mythic and getting some gear or feeling like I actually did somthing, I feel like classic will be a Friday/Saturday long hour gaming session type thing for me

Until you wipe 40 times on a boss and people are angry at the worthless ret pally are start fleeing to guilds with better raid lead.

No beta invite (yet, fingers crossed I‚Äôll get in a wave), but that‚Äôs okay. I enjoyed coming home from work yesterday and spending a little bit of time watching others play it.  Just hoping we get some solid beta testers in upcoming waves to get this as close as _possible_ to vanilla, since we know the CCs/influencers are mainly there just to market this. 
---
Account is from July 2006 with active sub and have played every xpac since.

Our time will come.

---
Why are ppl saying it's only a 2day beta? Is it ending so soon?
---
LOOOOOOOOL.
---
Honestly I'll cry. Reason why i dont play private servers is the high ping really fucks with me, both PvE and PvP.
---
If theres no oceanic servers, I don't know if i can play classic.
---
Lol na I wish I was though.
---
Haha! Awesome, and relevant username I notice :).
---
Now I'm rethinking letting him join my guild...
---
Nah. People did this dumb overconfident shit in Vanilla, too.
---
are there people actually stupid enough to think that private server player are actually trying to say blizzard is wrong about stuff on classic?  when all they are doing is expressing surprise at how different the game is actually suppose to be?
---
im much more hyped for bc than vanilla
---
i just found the zones amazing and the raids were so good
---
it was so much more modern compared to the base game was a huge leap at the time. i think vanilla to bc was the biggest change the game ever had with 1 expac
---
The problem is no mana regen and lack of taunt. Won't work sustained.

My guess is that it's trolling.
---
I would actually care. I don't like the mentality of, "Its a beta I can do whatever." The fact that he even has that mentality and laughed about doing it is scummy as fuck. That being said I don't watch/follow streamers, I get nothing out of watching people play and maybe his audience will love him for it.
---
tbh, I don't even remember retail Vanilla having *that* much weather. Certainly could be false memory, but either way, I love the way that looks. You practically can't see his character in some moments.

He started arms, at least

Yep, initially Dwarf mages were a thing but they took it out because the Alliance had more race-class options than the Horde.

I think the downvotes came due to your post and negative attitude not anything else.

Tips didn't play vanilla back then, he doesn't knows how important server rep is.   
---
  Another point on why tips is a bad "content creator" and should be ignored and chased off, he's quite toxic and if making up insider info and leading people on with nothing but lies to get views.   
---
 It shows there's absolutely no reason why he should've gotten an invite over Joana, I have no clue why he got a pass to blizz interviews over people like madseasonshow.
---
I was a little miffed to see Panzer streaming it on my FB feed after all the drama around her and classic. Though I feel like 90% of that drama was not her fault. I am self aware enough to know I was being petty though.
---
So is it less xp from mobs, less xp from quests, or is he just being inefficient since he's streaming?
---
The hunched one looks like he's taking a shit
---
People here are always angry, even moreso now that streamers get to play and they don't. Welcome to the classic sub :)
---
Apparently but you will still see endless whining on here about it.
---
Can't imagine somebody saying 'see you in azeroth' outloud. Even if I shared the hobby I would immediately think less of them.
---
Reaction of the other players?
---
Good thing that this time we get BC and still have Vanilla then, right?
---
oh cool, how did it preform ?
---
wouldnt this work against you in raid against boss mechanics
---
New to Classic, it has been a feature in regular WoW for years.
---
I absolutely should not be getting this much satisfaction at seeing a popular streamer - a know-it-all who has made significant amounts of money on this game - fail to understand:
---
1. Equipment Repairs
---
2. Line of Sight / Spell Range
---
3. Shield Block
---
4. Coordination
---
For those who have watched all of the streams, purchased merchandise, and studied every guide he ever released...welcome to the *original* World of Warcraft experience.
---
I'm feeling smug af right now. I'm gonna downvote myself
---
All I want is a BC server.  Best memories in WoW :)
---
So Orc shaman it is then.
---
If this is a change, I approve.
---
I've played on pservers like everyone, but I do hope things shape up differently.  I think it would be cool if my planed War route is like totally unviable and I have to change it up.  The exp seems to be off, I'm looking forward to when the theorycrafters get to 30 and start experimenting.

University can take up most/all of those 15 years if you become a doctor.

Assuming you got a masters degree. Here, that's 5 years of university, 3 years of high school and 9 years of primary school. Some are a year older due to being immigrants and getting another year in primary school for learning the language. Quite a lot of people take a year or two off from studying between high school and university. If you did all of that, and you were in your last year of university right now, you would be 13 at the time of launch assuming your birthday is before november 23.
---
Wow is rated "teen" as in 13+.
---
Bus shock?
---
I must still be high from yesterday. #nochanges
---
It's hard to just shard a single zone without causing pop in problems when you move zones. Having the entire content layered allows for players to thin out more naturally as you get to higher levels.
---
Well, normal people who dont stream got invites too, so no, that is not the reason. Joana didnt get it because he wasn't lucky, AND his audience isnt that big
---
False
---
Obvious hate ? Well if you were 1/4 as smart you‚Äôre trying to appear you would see the communications with others who actually commented the streamers they like . Then there‚Äôs captain save a hoe like yourself who feels they are putting someone in their place , getting some virtual straightening if you will . I made my intentions pretty clear . I stated what I‚Äôm looking for which are this communities favorite streamers and least favorite streamers while also letting them know my least favorite . And the fact I haven‚Äôt watched enough to truly deem one my favorite. In the words of some jackass from Reddit ‚Äúgrow up . If you don‚Äôt like it , turn it off ‚Äú
---
I feel this on a personal level.
---
Idk how old you are at 13 but I was in that grade. Now I‚Äôm in grad school. Still school!
---
I wasnt going to entertain this but I have to ask. How is my general question of why people are so upset about this edition and what it provides negative? 
---
If that's a considered a "negative attitude" yall need to get your feels in check.
---
Do you idiots realize this is a joke from their friend group that Esfand did to Staysafe in the invitational?
---
Too late I think
---
[yes.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/6ADLV4r.gifv)
---
yeah because there isn't already a million leveling guides available
---
With some practice and a tool to set your registry to activate the other windows by just hovering over them (I used X-Mouse Controls) instead of clicking you can play all the screens very fast without needing any 3rd party software.
---
Because it means they started WOW late and never played vanilla
---
I watched most of it from Soda's POV.
---
Tips made mistakes that can be excused as inexperience, such as failing the jumps and engaging without knowing what to expect.
---
Soda is literally the root cause of most of his complaints about Tips. He just played really, really badly. 
---
Tips' deaths was mostly due to Soda flat out forgot he was healing, being distracted or running oom from inefficient healing / spending mana on damage where he shouldn't have.
---
I don't really care for either of these two players, but while the complaints Tips regularly get on reddit might be justified, Soda was way worse in this run. Other than ninjaing and deleting the cloak, Tips wasn't bad at all. They're both about as annoying and obnoxious as any other 14 year old boy, though.
---
Good to hear, thanks for the answer
---
"I can't see myself getting home after a long day and wanting to sit and grind 30% of a level"
---
I think you will be pleasantly surprised. That being said. Soda wiping on low level dungeons is part of what people mean when they say the game is actually hard. But they are communicating poorly when they say it.
---
The dungeons aren't actually "hard". They simply demand you slow down and take them seriously. If you do that they are far from "hard." For an expert like you that may mean nothing but, think of it this way. If you are a non-gamer and you get to 19 and do Wailing Caverns. It might not be "hard" but it does command your attention in a way. Retail leveling dungeons never do.
---
The retail is too easy crowd come from a place. Where they are casuals who never make it out of raid finder. So no piece of content they have ever played. Has ever demanded to be taken seriously. Not the leveling not, the dungeons not the raiding. 
---
It's very true to say Mythics are much harder. That being said 99% of people never make it their so they hate retail. Which is why I say classic will crush retail. It's not that it's better at it's peaks it isn't. It's that it's better for the kind of people who never make it to "mythics." Because of this the population will explode. Then even people who prefer retail will move to classic because of it's popularity.
---
MMORPG's are a lot like planets. The bigger they get. The more gravity they generate. The more pull they have. Once classic reaches critical mass. It is my opinion retail will die because it's too niche.
---
The mind control seemed to be bugged
---
Why do you think that?
---
&gt; Man sounds like it's gonna hurt when you get ganked as you try to cheat the very system you're trying to hate on so hard.  
---
This doesn't even make sense. For all you know, I'm a loser who plays on a pve server. Even if I were afraid of getting ganked, layers help me avoid them LOL  
---
It's just shitty implementation. Go back to being a retail baby where you can shard away from pvp freely.  
---
&gt; World first Rag or you're nothing.
---
Rag is a joke and can be like 30-manned. You must think this game is really hard. Vanilla was always fun because of the community and awfulness of getting anything together - NOT because the content was particularly difficult. You'd know that if you ever played it.
---
THIS beta only lasts 2 days. There will be more, with more people and stress tests.
---
Ok and this is for classic wow. A game in which the people who don‚Äôt play their games requested for due to them shutting down the only quality access to a game they not only purchased, but spent hundreds of dollars on in subscriptions during the time they kept that expansion running. 
---
You really think the people still subbed are the majority of people who wanted classic wow? It‚Äôs entirely different from other expansion demos where if you were interested in playing, you were most likely already playing their previous expansion. 
---
Many people are going to be shafted out of $15 because of this when they subbed and didn‚Äôt get a beta invite for a month. Just charge the sub as soon as they get selected for the beta and don‚Äôt make them actively subscribe for a chance. 
---
Activision stock is almost cut in half from its high last year. You better believe they‚Äôre trying to improve their bottom line in any way they can and this is just a poor way to treat your potential customers.
---
Because that's were we've been playing vanilla wow untill now. It's interesting to know what the major differences are.
---
Some people are just slow to catch on.
---
Enough talking to me!  Get back in the game! (I kid)
---
Just curious as I haven‚Äôt played vanilla in well over a decade and wasn‚Äôt sure which tree is better for leveling.
---
Does he really present himself as such ? He seems to be a modest nice guy, never heard him bragging about anything. His content concerning dungeons (like the BRD video) is just great though, no need to be hating on him. Also, if he actually continuously played WoW since Vanilla and didn't touch the PServers too much it's not surprising his memories are foggy.
---
Douchey is the key word.
---
I don't hate Tips. That should be clear. But I'm not gonna treat big streamers like celebrities if I find them in game, so knowing that Tips is a douche would influence me in the same way that I think...... Steve Spurrier is a douche. Will I ever see him? Probably not. Would I have a beer with him if given the chance? Hell no.
---
To catch mew?
---
I haven't played in 9 months but stayed subbed hoping for an eventual 20 yr anniversary statue to go with my 10 yr one. I got in the beta.
---
how dare he make a misplay
---
Layers are big shards.
---
Save them from fortnite, hype classic for them kids.
---
Yeah. Because that's what I said.
---
So go to wowhead/mmochampion like everyone else
---
I'm starting my first teaching job this year.  :'(
---
Not planning on leading, but I was in a top guild US on my rogue and got away with running my seal fate dagger build that I used for pvp until like half way through AQ when I had to switch combat to keep up. Ended up just pvping the rest of vanilla. Hated pve combat.
---
i think this guy has been stabbed by Angwe during his youth
---
Taurens used to be able to autoattack each other through the nagrand pillars...  
---
It was fucked up
---
Yes, very big shards. I know.
---
Your post implied a warrior fury tank but you linked a paladin spec. Paladins are not viable tanks for raid content as they have poor mana regen, with extensive mana needs, and no taunt. Fury warrior tanks do well depending on the fight, and are used when healing isn't as big of an issue, such as speed runs or previously cleared content. I'm not sure how viable it is for progression.
---
Guess we'll just have to wait a bit and see üòÅ
---
He wasn't life tapping when I watched him while he was complaining about low mana while on full hp. Lock main btw
---
"Everybody" doesnt know, only hardcore wow followers so far. Classic Wow needs casual crowd also
---
I actually really like soda.
---
I know it's not what you asked for, but I'm 99% sure tipsout rolled orc, so that would be the same starting zone... so maybe that'll do?
---
My post is focused on the area over which the system covers - hence my title - but yes, just phase 1... if you believe them.
---
So $84 worth of goodies then?
---
It‚Äôs one of, if not the largest, reason why this Classic is coming back in the first place...
---
There will aaaaaaalways be people doing the dungeons. Don't worry.

There's a distinct difference when you compare them to retail, it's worth actually calling them by their name else people assume it's going to be like retail.
---
Staysafe was averaging 1,100 - 1,500 viewers the past month.  he's has a pretty good audience.
---
which can be all the time.  /1 LF1M HOGGER  \*poof*
---
When I get off work... and do some house work. Relatives coming in for the weekend unexpectedly... Adulting sucks. I hope to at least get from 9-10 tonight though before bed.
---
Maybe. Community will be split.
---
yah idk who to give credit to. i just bookmarked it
---
So what? That doesn‚Äôt mean the difficulty isn‚Äôt there...
---
lol @ Shadowpriest
---
different mechanics such as pathing, mob locations, spawn rates, hp/mana pools, attack speeds, abilities
---
the list is long, the small things add up
---
Cataclysm?
---
Yeah I agree. If you look at a top down view ARR is designed closer to modern than classic. But experiencing the game it *feels* closer to classic. I think that's mainly because modern wow has lost the ability to hide its progression systems well. It *feels* like you're just going through the motions of the system to get rewards instead of being invested in a game. As of yet I don't think ARR has that problem. 
---
And, while somewhat small in scope, combat in general is slower and more challenging in ARR than modern wow. And since the majority of gameplay in both games is combat, that changes a lot of how the game is viewed.
---
the manual even still says dwarves can be mages.  also druids can use 'spears'
---
lots of different things with spells too like priests having 'holy word' instead of 'power word' (same functionality though)  and paladins having healing aura.

moonfare
---
Depends if general chat channels are linked or not. I genuinely don't know the answer to that question.
---
Less CPU usage on the servers. 
---
Why include it when the vast majority of us couldn‚Äôt see or lagged to death on our Compaq presario desktops. 
---
It was awesome, but only 2 of my clan makes from EQ could run it on anything more than mid. 
---
I had the BARE REQUIREMENTS to play Vanilla. 
---
Potato with a toaster of a GPU. 
---
It would take 20 minutes to zone in EQ to major cities.
---
I‚Äôm really not convinced the amount of keys are so limited that it cannot cover both purposes.  You‚Äôre talking about maybe 10-15 more invites going out to people (Joana isn‚Äôt the only one) who would give good feedback to improve the game (in case they ever get someone in the team who pays attention to this shit) and possibly raise interest among other viewers as well so from a marketing point of view its not lost.  
---
In addition it gives more visibility on twitch to people who watch them, that is an advertisement on its own.   Regarding the streamers from other games; you don‚Äôt even know how much they would play to promote the game, some of them probably don‚Äôt even care and won‚Äôt play at all; whereas these guys who are interested/hyped have more guaranteed to being viewers in. 
---
In addition if you want to introduce people from other games into it, it would be more influential if the game was at least a little cleaned from major bugs, even though it‚Äôs beta some people get turned off by this shit.  The game usually improves with every new wave of beta going out, you can introduce these players a few builds later and really not lose anything at all.  There‚Äôs still more than 2 months to win the hearts of these people. 
---
While I definitely agree it is good to reach out to other playerbases, I think the value of both scenarios are much closer than you think.
---
Nice that will be fun times!
---
Do we know how dark nights are, especially in Duskwood?
---
Ashenvale or Stonetalon will see some of the earliest contested action. Barrens is not really used by Alliance, unless they are cutting through from Theramore to get someplace else.
---
Im pretty sure subset of players who would be ok with this definitely exists
---
&gt;u beat me by one day, I'm December 26. The Christmas gift that lasted 15 years.
---
Lol that's what mine was as well! (waited till 1/2/05 to activate though).
---
r/gatekeeping much?
---
&gt;Tips made mistakes that can be excused as inexperience, such as failing the jumps and engaging without knowing what to expect.
---
I'll take your word for it seeing how I didn't watch the video, but at the same time [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/PoliteModernWormMingLee) is pretty damning. In my experience groups coordinated pulls and everything, i.e., the warrior waited to make sure the healer (and dps) was ready before doing anything. Again, I can't stress enough that I didn't watch the video like you did so this could've just been a one off, but just does not give me a good impression. 
---
&gt;but while the complaints Tips regularly get on reddit might be justified
---
I don't know enough about Sodapoppin to have an opinion, but I "noped out" of Tips when he came out w/ that video saying he "had an inside source" on Classic and that he was "70% sure we're getting a 1:1 recreation of WoW from 1.1-1.12 patch by patch," or something to that effect, then everything else he did after just was, well terrible. The point being,  I fully admit to my bias of disliking Tips so I may not be analyzing Soda's incompetence as much as I should
---
I had Kiss of the spider on my 1st warr.  These are obv. terrible weapons for pvp and yet they were far and away the most fun weapons for pvp I ever had.  I kept them til wotlk and I'd like to get them again.
---
Same with me. I don‚Äôt think I deserve a beta invite... but I sure was happy to see that Blizzard email last night with the beta invite though üòÅ
---
And now in BFA they dont care anymore and load EVERY CLASS into Hord Allied Races while Ally sits there crying
---
I think he's pretty clearly joking because he grouped up with him later with no issues for something else.
---
I think expecting a quality product for your money rather being a corporate bootlick is pretty mature myself
---
Yes. There are only two sentences in that comment, I don't think it's too much to ask that you at least read both. :)
---
This a big program / will it make my computer lag?
---
There's always people running dungeons on a server with a healthy pop, even by the time the dungeon set upgrade chain gets added. Scholo for flasks, UBRS for getting alts attuned &amp; flask recipe, Righteous Orb &amp; mount farming in Strat, etc.
---
It's just a clip dude lol is it not okay to say what the fuck?  For all you know he did report it after this clip.
---
Chuck Norris doesn't flush the toilet. He scares the shit out of it.
---
I had a bunch of addons in vanilla, and that wasn't one of them. I'm not even sure if I used it in TBC.
---
Salt?
---
gz! have fun!
---
Why? In Vanilla entire guilds got free server transfers.
---
I'm saying there wont be enough 60's after 2 weeks for it to be possible.
---
Absolute quality
---
This was initially about high taxes being bad, not about you finding countries where conditions weren't ideal.
---
I live in one of the highest taxed countries in the world. We also happen to have a higher PPP median than the US. Which means more people can afford a car (or anything) here than in the US.
---
There, an example of high taxes not being bad. The initial assertion is debunked.
---
My guess is mobs take longer to kill due to higher armour values so players take more damage due to the increased duration of the fights and require more time to recover.
---
You can't gank in the Barrens, it's frigging Horde territory. Unless ppl intentionally flag themselves
---
so how is the chance to get an inv when i sub now
---
There‚Äôs a difference between using time off and faking sick, this shouldn‚Äôt need to be explained?
---
Lol what? It‚Äôs not about rewarding people, it‚Äôs about baiting people into subbing and risk getting nothing but losing $15. Yeah you get the ability to play retail wow but that‚Äôs not why people resubbed and they know that.
---
Is that how it was in Vanilla? If so, that's how it should be in Classic.
---
Layering is something that decreases over time as the tourist playerbase shrinks. Once its 1 layer the server is how it used to be. For some realms it will take 4 weeks. For some 8 weeks. For some 12 weeks. 
---
But if there are servers still having multiple layers once phase2 arives. That server will have queue timers instead.
---
It is sharding done right.
---
Yes, people will be running them, especially the 58-60 dungeons, many of the dungeons have mats that even lvl 60 geared players will need, for enchants/crafting, ect. Scholo gets run for the flasks, and the tailoring drops, Lbrs for the tailoring and keys to Ubrs, Strat for orbs, skin, and holy water, Ubrs for the scales, and recipes, BRD for the pristine things, and rep with TB. You also have alts to take account of.
---
TL;DR yes people will be running them for a long time
---
The level of retardation..
---
This happens with every game i play, i always remember the graphics being way better and im surprised when i actually see screenshots of that game later on. And with franchises with multiple games in my mind they all look the same. Was talking with a friend about this a few days ago and an example i gave them was gears of war. In my mind the first and the last one look the same. Then out of curiosity i googled gears 1 and boy looks it worse than in my mind.
---
Forgot about that cause i stopped playing my pally around when BWL came out and i switched to warrior onward. Good catch.
---
Seems like you were talking about yourself this whole time.
---
Unfortunately he didn‚Äôt get a beta invite (as of 9:30pm last night).
---
and every expansion launch after mop, and every hype event in the last year and a half, wow is boring to watch, wow events are exciting to watch, that's the twitch cycle
---
he's an idiot. at one point they didn't know which way to go (they were doing WC) and the chat was giving them instructions, sodapoppin said to follow the people (instructions) at which tips said in the in-game chat "fuck the people". fucking clown
---
I refuse to hype for BC until I am actually playing classic
---
When I played, I first played lock. So when I saw hunters running around with their pets named "Fluffybunny" and "Buttstuff", I was thinking, "How did the random name generator give them THAT??"
---
Holy fuck.  Thats beautiful!
---
On 1 server and you need to remember while you certainly are correct this is peak eu time, most Europeans wouldn't have had a chance to play yesterday and if they came home from work today, made dinner and sat down to play, they wouldn't have reached barrens yet.
---
Joana's audience consists of people who are going to play Classic. Blizzard is using the streamers to hype it up, they need to justify the development. Especially if we ever hope to see TBC/Wrath or anything like this again.
---
No this is useless
---
Wow, you took it to a rape example and you‚Äôre talking about controversial comments. The meme is directed at high school kids, not adults who are bettering their life by continuing their education.
---
One of the things I loved doing is running lower ilevel characters in ffxiv thru some old content and helping them.  While I do that, since it's faceroll stuff I'll act like a tour guide and tell them different shit, like read this note and it will tell you the color you need to click before the boss, or mechanics that are usually ignored but are still there just for fun.  Or different pets that drop or gear they might like.  I'm certain I and many others will help many lowly recruits to whatever guild you join get geared up.
---
Dwarves weren't in the game til CATA
---
If phase 2 arives and servers still have multiple layers because of the big playerbase. That server will be called "full" and will probebly have queue timers when trying to log in.
---
if they're not that'll make all the more reason to join your realms discord or whatever so ur not missing out on huge swaths of your community
---
There will definitely be ganking man.  Plenty of people either won't have much interest in playing Classic or are simply in no rush to level, and the idea of screwing with people by ganking them as soon as possibly will definitely appeal to some.
---
Honestly, if I wasn't trying to race as far as I can the first week, I'd probably do exactly this lol.
---
Oh so is "hybrid" the same as "off-healer"?
---
&gt; stabbed by Angwe
---
I love that people like him exist but, no I would rather do some content as well. To me the fact your server can have villains so reviled that I actually knew exactly of whom you speak is part of what makes classic amazing. For me ganking is like shaking the bag. I want something to come loose. War I want conflict and war to come loose. It's a means to an end.
---
I wonder how much of that is just the simple fact that PCs were pretty shitty back then compared to now?
---
I wonder what max graphics vs what most people were running on did to weather effects in Vanilla.
---
I mean shroud is the literal #1 streamer currently (numbers) and he did stream retail for a few days/weeks and has said multiple times he's pretty excited for classic WoW. He also represents a slightly less hardcore viewpoint as well.
---
Which is why I don't play BfA, I just subscribe to r/wow and the cinematics shows up on my front page. I simply praised how well the cinematic team is doing.
---
Oops, saw the other thread first.  This is absolutely beautiful!
---
Please, that's nothing. You can unlock Goblin Luigi if shoot out of the cannon outside of Peach's Keep near Stormwind.
---
You can see through most of the old water in Vanilla. There's some bodies of water such as rivers in STV that you can't.
---
a little bit. The rogue was trying to run away after his evasion was over which was hurting party dps some, even though he wasn't even getting out of the boss's hitbox so it really wasnt accomplishing anything
---
i don't have the drop down menu, does it come with the beta? i tried applying for a ptr account in account management, but it won't let me create one.
---
A level 20 Rogue will do alright for himself.  Especially if he brings a friend.
---
Lmao Sodapoppin played the actual WoW beta in 2004 due to his friend‚Äôs dad having access to it iirc, reached 60 in the full release, and as far as I know he has played every expansion since. Think what you want about the guy but he‚Äôs pretty much the definition of a wow veteran.
---
Yes. Then mere the ones that die, which is functionally identical to having layer in the first place
---
I think calling people butt hurt is negative. Also saying what did the $100 get you besides a statue is pretty disingenuous as I think you know what else the CE comes with.
---
I know when out of combat he said he doesn't want to life tap because with the current beta regen rates it's faster to wait five seconds. Don't know if this is true or not. In combat I guess he wanted to play it safe and not tap in case fear pulls more mobs.
---
He always hit that hard, I remember being one shot on my rogue the first encounter.
---
Private servers aren't retail vanilla lmao
---
OP didn't ask how close classic is to private servers.
---
Thats right...Menethil got pretty fucked up in the Cataclysm, didnt it?
---
It depends on a progess state. I was a main tank back in vanilla and frequently I had to replace a raid leader. I must say that the biggest issue for raid was an ability of people to follow a strat. It was not crucial to have best dps because with decent dps you can fit in enrage timer pretty good. Im not sure I will lead in classic, but I want a more social raid with a smart people rather than raid of dumbass best in slot dpsers and healers.
---
Oh I quickly learned to take care of my healers. My pet would slowly die on certain pulls (raid or dungeon). If I wanted the healer to heal Whiskers, I had to try harder to make their lives easier.
---
Now that I'm going to be tanking dungeons, I will be prioritizing healers and dps I want to play with as well. Good tanks get to be choosy as well. :)
---
&gt; updates textures
---
They could for those that they have actually recreated.
---
&gt; and models
---
Anything **except** player model will not be possible or such an unfathomable task that it would be considered impossible.
---
Another example of childish jealously on this sub.
---
Eh on a scale of "no changes" to "WoD 0.5" I rate roster management somewhere just barely above how extra options (like colorblind accessibility) are being carried over from retail.
---
If the dev team working on classic didn't care about what kind of vanilla experience they're giving, they would have kept loot trading in its original concept, not listened to phase feedback, and have not understood (or cared about) the fuss about sharding. if it escalates to something like micro transactions, it will be because the project was fundamentally perverted, not because of an innocuous UI addition.
---
Sounds like you didn't get world first rag. Dang man. It's ok maybe next time.
---
tbf, theres a lot of competition for that.
---
...though you may be right...
---
The worst part of the pservers is the bigoty, racism, and sexism in all the chats. Thank god they wont make it pass the pay wall or get banned from classic
---
Sounds profitable.
---
Sure but how was it toxic?
---
And tons of people started in BC and Wotlk. BC isn't vanilla, so why no hate to them?
---
Were "spears" supposed to be a range weapon or the original name for polearms?
---
This is very much me as well! I suspect there will be a slew of guilds with the original/older crowd that'll only raid on weekends / 1-night/wk due to commitments. There will HAVE to be. ;)
---
OMG will you find a job instead of creating new accounts and posting on reddit all day?
---
I'm certain tons and tons of People are in the same position as you.
---
Top notch response üëç
---
So tauren hitboxes back then were actually enormous. It isn't as bad-looking if it's a tauren vs. a mob or different race, but tauren vs tauren you both have the gigantic hitboxes so it looks goofy and buggy af.
---
I think its moreso that some people genuinely want to be mad about certain things, and theyre willing to ignore facts and logic to continue being mad.
---
Don't expect much of a conversation there's at least 5 posts like this a day.
---
Solid shortblade is a deadmines quest. Requires completion of defias escort and another chain. The items probably also won‚Äôt drop from any defias like they do on pservers but only the elites in and around deadmines. 
---
Probably won‚Äôt be getting that around lvl 15.
---
the idea was if it worked for warriors too dps/tank then maybe pally/dps tank sorry for the misunderstanding
---
Revoke his Beta pass
---
I'm afraid I'll just be chasing nostalgia that I can never truly relieve as a jaded adult by playing classic. Maybe it's best to just let it be a wonderful memory from another time and let it go..
---
nice, didn't even consider the use of the word troll. thanks for the info on the orc starting zone, i couldn't remember if they were the same or just close to each other. I will check out tips start.
---
haven't watched the video, but I'm guessing the players are so used to the latest expansions, that they were simply unprepared for the challenge. I'm guessing the first few months of release will filter out a chunk of the casuals.
---
No fucking shit.
---
I mentioned private servers because the previous two comments were comparing to them.
---
Use those reading skills that they taught in the 4th grade. I believe in you!
---
I'm just going to pull out one part of your conversation, the Naxx comparison, from what i've read and seen in a couple of interviews, WotLK Naxx wasn't tuned correctly. Which sort of makes sense (how are you going to make a 40 man raid where people back then barely knew what they were doing, both players and developer). It's funny though everyone seems to say raiding is easier now, we just didn't datamine everything to hell and back, it was all still discovery and fun (thats why you still have people saying they are gonna roll subpar specs for classic). I'll give Vanilla a shot but I doubt i'll be able to make a commitment for raiding as I work evenings and almost every day. It just requires way more time especially with certain classes having to gather their own stuff.
---
Are you okay with some of the UI changed, or battle.net being put in also like it is in the beta currently? Genuinely just asking out of curiosity
---
You're correct, no need to buy anything anymore, with just a sub you have access to everything except the latest xpac.
---
Every time a new xpac comes out they give for free the previous one to all accounts, even if inactive.
---
Classic will share the sub, no box to buy nor anything else.
---
TIL no one should ever advertise because everyone already knows about them
---
Your know what else is incorrect? Your reading comprehension.
---
yeah, that's perfect. couldn't remember if they were the same, so thank you for that.
---
Yup, had I not already had a sub I wouldn't have resubbed for a chance. Absolutely not worth even $15
---
Of those you mention Barbership and the pet food are the only ones that wouldn't make me instantly not want to play.
---
As for what I'd be okay with, I've a position since the anouncement that's pretty simple: If it can be done with an addon, I don't care it makes it into the game as default.
---
Sorry for the late reply.
---
A TL:DR completely depends on goblins in your server
---
A good question, and honestly, most of this will depend on 1: your servers playerbase size. And 2: how many goblins.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of goblins preparing and discussing tactics on classic, to the point I‚Äôm expecting a lot on every realm and most will find a hard time even getting scraps.
---
It also depends how they choose to operate. For the most part, on retail, the entire economy is controlled by us. If we want something to shoot up in price, it does. If we want it lower (to make crafting something) we can push it cheaper.  
---
It‚Äôs really, really, hard to ‚Äúoverload‚Äù a goblin on how much materials they have, more less multiple goblins.  Because most good goblins will want to keep all of their gold in mats / items / pets ect.  And we‚Äôll often own multiple guild banks, character banks, and in my case multiple accounts, to hold more. 
---
A example here that I can think of that kind of (but not entirely) fits from personal experience.
---
Winters kiss during BFA launch. This was extremely easy to farm, especially with. Warmode. (Even easier multiboxing) I ended up farming 50k pretty quickly myself, and put them up at 85g (each)
---
I only would keep max stacks of 200 up, and only a few stacks at a time to make it seem there wasn‚Äôt much of a supply.
---
Prices obviously would attempt to drop, so I simply would buy them out and add them to my storage.  On this realm I started with 5k earlier this week (due to joining friends) but due to winter‚Äôs sales I was able to keep buying more.
---
Eventually I got a 200k stock pile.  But the problem, much like layering is said to bring, is they started dropping in price ‚Äúmajorly‚Äù - down to 30g globally.
---
At this point though, which was about six-seven days in, I had made 2.7m (not including what I invested into other things) and I decided, you know what? I want the price to be 85g, period.
---
So I forced the market back up. Anyone listing under me i‚Äôd Buy out (unless they only listed 1-2 stacks, or non-max stacks) and is still but the super cheap ones. 
---
This was Brute forcing, which is dangerous if your low on funds, and isn‚Äôt worth the risk. But I knew I owned the vast majority of the supply so I already controlled the market here.
---
Eventually over the coming weeks I sold off 85% of my supply, for 85g a pop (despite globally being back up to around 45g)  I kept the rest for my own needs and to help my friends do mythics. 
---
Once I ‚Äúexited‚Äù this market, the prices did (over the next month and a half) go down to the global price.  But at this point most people also weren‚Äôt farming it.
---
I could have kept the price high, but I had better things to do. So what I‚Äôm getting at is, it really will just depend how goblins play the classic market.  I believe a lot will make it appear there aren‚Äôt many materials on the market (or, in my honest opinion, there actually will be a lack due to how many players playing, being more skilled and needing things quicker / more often, wanting to be more efficient this time, ect) 
---
Long term, the economy will even itself out (except for the cases of goblins forcing prices) but due to how many people are playing, I wouldn‚Äôt expect prices to be ‚Äúlower‚Äù just because of layering. 
---
And the more and more I think about it all, layering may actually almost be ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to get even a decent amount of raids what they need to begin progression.  Otherwise, even a single guild will be lucky.  But /shrug. That isn‚Äôt really a problem i‚Äôm In, so eh.
---
In the interest of fairness, I think many people are less concerned about the actual layering and more concerned that it won‚Äôt actually end after several weeks. 
---
Blizz doesn‚Äôt have a flawless track record on keeping their word, and many see the change from no sharding, to some sharding in starting zones, to ‚Äúcontinent wide sharding‚Äù for weeks or months as a concerning trend to ease the community into accepting sharding or some variant thereof.
---
I'm now 45 with 3 kids and full time job. Most nights I dont get online until 9pm.
---
If need be I'll find people like me and create my own guild and have a great time in this game.
---
Here's the water from 1.12: [https://i.imgur.com/ZTdLaac.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZTdLaac.jpg)
---
Here's the water on BfA: [https://i.imgur.com/HHebkkb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HHebkkb.jpg)
---
Here's the water from one of Joana's leveling videos that he made in 2006: [https://youtu.be/v0BPUXwqpeg?t=3230](https://youtu.be/v0BPUXwqpeg?t=3230)
---
There are some rivers and other bodies of water that you can't see through but most of the water in Vanilla was transparent/translucent.
---
Well, we're starting to get heritage armor. Maybe heritage weapons next?
---
Bombarding Tradechat/Panser calling her a stupid pink haired bitch was the very definition of toxic Haha 
---
Honestly man idk what to tell you. If you dont see how toxic the classic community got after Nostalrius I cant help.  
---
Im glad Classic is coming, I signed the petition, I dont like the current XPAC, but I still think the community gave itself a bad name
---
So we're in the same boat! I'm excited that we will see those level of cinematics in the remastered W3.
---
Your Post is dumb af
---
World PvP, imo, officially died with the ToC patch in WotLK. Dungeon finder meant no one used dungeon summoning stones anymore and the raid stones were all located either in a neutral zone with no PvP or inside the raid itself. With no meaningful farm areas at that point in the expansion people were left to gank levelers and the occasional raid in the opposite factions capital cities.
---
I feel like they tend to be very outlandish.
---
I read one that was basically trying to make classic = retail (wow-tokens, weapon skills being erased, etc.)
---
I guess I am just curious on how hardcore people are to #nochanges, or if they are flexible on quality of life stuff or cosmetic things
---
People already got beta invites
---
He's not saying there shouldn't be bag management.  He's simply saying that illogical situations like this one are OK to fix.  If I'm turning in an item, and then receiving an item in exchange - I shouldn't need an additional item removed in order to make room.  The item I'm trading in provides the new.
---
I'm OK with this change.  I'm also OK if they fix it, simply because that's how it was in Vanilla.  But acting like 'fixing' this would nullify bag management is laughable.
---
Pretty sure soda wasn't even paying attention either
---
Well, this is something that is indeed very common on PServers because of their gigantic populations, but I remember that back before LFG (including in Vanilla, but also in BC/WotLK), if you weren't on a big server and wanted to do some dungeons while leveling, you sometimes had to take whatever you could find, and that meant you very rarely could make high level groups for a dungeon. That made them even harder.
---
Wait people are complaining about the graphics? That's just no change for the sake of no change and plain dumb.
---
I am a purest, I want to relive the experience for what it was. 
---
I don't want any changes that impacts gameplay negatively or positively.
---
QOL changes such as moving characters up and down on the login screen is fine. 
---
Changing key mechanics and numbers as you described in your post would alter the game and meta.
---
WoW culture is best culture.
---
Unfortunately it may be the case but who knows. I‚Äôll just be excited to actually have hard leveling content again. As well as actually not zerging every dungeon and being able to slowing crawl through it.
---
Yeah he did, I honestly had no clue that WCIII had a beta going for it. I mean I know the remaster is being worked on but I just didn't think about it.
---
It auto pauses the program/animations when you have a video/game in full screen.
---
And this is how guilds form \^.
---
Alliance? PvE realm? :D
---
Which is still research, which I stated in not original post. You need to reread it if you have missed that after two replies.
---
To be fair she was calling people who just wanted to be left alone and play their game losers/idiots stuck in the past. By any standard, she is a stupid pink haired bitch, who only changed her mind when Blizzard threw money at her. She's an intellectual whore. No better than a common politician.
---
whatever makes you feel superior
---
Yes entire world is layered and has the same pop as a vanilla server. Why are we making shit meme's about this?
---
Every single change that led to the decline of wow was liked by someone
---
I think #6 will change eventually.  Either that or we're going to have an awful lot of fury warrior engineers...
---
That is fair, I tend to forget that some addons will add a level of quality of life that may not of been there in classic.
---
What type of help are you hoping addons give?
---
Quest trackers?
---
I'm fine with that if it means more people are playing.
---
Sweet! No more shallow end of the pool. Let's head to the deep end and see who knows how to swim!
---
Maybe no one has said that exact thing, but plenty of people have said variations of "this is not how it's supposed to be, it's different from private servers", the implication being that private servers are in fact 1:1 perfect copies.
---
It‚Äôs what my RL friends and I are doing. Sunday raids. Maybe one other day a week like Wednesday‚Äôs.  We are not aiming for server firsts or Scarab Lord kinda stuff. Hope we get RPPvP servers as we are all RPers and most of us like to PvP.
---
This is a conversation we don't need, at all.
---
Point them out, I'll hate on them. Filthy plebs.
---
&gt; Dual spec or cheaper respec costs
---
Kill me.
---
Undecided on Faction
---
Pve of PvP doesn't matter. As long as I find players who game at the same times I'm on I'll roll with the crew
---
Are you talking about [this one](https://i.imgur.com/g525yCE.png)?
---
This is neat! Has one been created for Mage?
---
I'd test that.
---
Install them all, see what (kinda) works.
---
You‚Äôll get your face crit off, a beautiful sight to see
---
Why are you implying I'm worked up?
---
Hi, /u/Gorrtan
---
Hes a poser. Which I dont understand the point of pretending to be knowledgeable about the game. Pretty annoying hes in the beta over Joana.
---
For example https://youtu.be/CDXylJZuVLY
---
&gt; grey quests give full rep in tbc 
---
I'm pretty sure it was during WoTLK, they changed both quests and mobs to give full rep in any case (green/grey).
---
That is true but given the circumstances of rereleasing a game from many years ago and is vastly different from their current game, most people are unsubbed prior to this information. It‚Äôs not like ur playing vanilla wow and now there‚Äôs a beta for tbc which requires an active sub to be chosen, most likely 90% of people are subbed Bc the expansion is very similar to the original. They are turning back the clock 15 years, that is more than half my life.
---
I have to be OK. These are things that are kinds required by the company in order to make the game.   
---
Your changes are just changing the design philosophy of classic
---
Very highly support this
---
Just download CT mod. Keep it  og.
---
I recall being upset by Tauren Shaman windfury procs from ‚Äòtoo far out‚Äô in vanilla BGs.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Would you be okay with any changes happening after the first 12 months - 2 years? Or you hope the server stays the exact same always?
---
Are there any other QoL changes you would be open to?
---
Yeah I can laugh about it in hindsight but at the time I got mad because it took me out of the game for a few days.
---
Minor tweaks to garbage dps spec trees like boomkin / feral / ele/ enh damage better. Other than that nothing .
---
False. You can boot up any bootlegged 1.12 client and verify because this is client side behavior.
---
My chemistry teacher played it
---
MrGM used a sellJunk addon and it worked just fine
---
Indeed. That gcd feels like forever when you want to cast!
---
Don‚Äôt you have some infowars special to be watching? Or some rabies vax to get?
---
&gt;Layering/Sharding is now here to stay forever because we've come to accept sub-par quality. 
---
Unlike the high quality of the original AQ40 launch, you mean? Unlike the high quality of dozens of dead servers?
---
It's exactly those sort of mechanics that make me so excited for Classic, and why I'm so hopeful for it being given a proper chance. 
---
As a resto main, I can't wait to be solidly in a supporting role again. I was a doinky little kid with no concept of 'overhealing' (lol what is mana efficiency?) back in 2005, so I'm excited to have a chance to do it right this time around!
---
HP regen is dependent upon gear, stats, race/racials, current level, class, sitting/standing, patch, etc.
---
Unless there is a drastic/extreme difference, there‚Äôs no way you can just watch a 10 second clip and make any kind of authoritative statement on HP regen.
---
Someone needs to check if quest helper works asap
---
&gt; private server player are actually trying to say blizzard is wrong about stuff on classic?
---
Maybe not in this particular case, but yes.  They insisted it was wrong when Warlock summons disappeared as soon as you started casting a new one.
---
Huh, none of my spelladin PreBIS shows up.
---
It's stupid. If you want that level of classic you're not even playing because the game is fun but just because you want to feel like you're in a different year at that point lol As asmongold said, if you want that experience go play on phone. The graphics will suck, your connection will be shit and you'll barely be able to move around. Have fun.
---
Not in the exact same boat but I‚Äôm trying to find a guild that raids one day during the week as well.  I think we will be fine.
---
&gt;Reagents get a specific bag to de-clutter your bags
---
Meh
---
&gt;Pets don't require food to stay happy anymore
---
NOOOOOOO
---
&gt;orcs get straight backs
---
&gt;Barber shop introduced to capital cities
---
&gt;Summoning stones placed decently closed to the entrance (not right outside it though, still make a group run together for a bit)
---
&gt;Class balance to numbers, make more specs/classes viable (this doesn't mean nerf things, just balance damage and healing numbers)
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Don't you imagine that Blizz is having this same conversation internally?
---
It's better to voice it and talk about the "why" behind it than to just be blindsided or not have a say in it.
---
Just my opinion, I am okay with being wrong
---
i didn't play beta so i'm honestly not sure what they are, but they were separate from polearms since it says warriors can use both polearms and spears.  i assume they were one handed polearms?  i've tried googling it but nothing really comes up
---
Totally fair. I get you
---
*4 years have passed since the united races banded together and stood united against the Whatever Legion. Though Azeroth was saved, the tenuous pact between the Horde and the Alliance has all but whatever'd.*
---
*The drums of whatever.. thunder once again.*
---
Tipsout is a huge piece of shit, and he has been exposed months ago.  He gained popularity by claiming to be a voice of the classic community - even though nobody knows who he is - also he claimed to be a vanilla VETERAN, can you believe that? This pathetic guy says he was there at the top raiding hardcore, a fucking moron that doesn't even know how to complete Wailing cavers (he has been playing horde for all his life, so no excuses faction excuses). It's just a shame that people are so naive and so easily manipulated by randoms that appear out of thin air and somehow manage to gather a following by basically being charlatons on Youtube.
---
but if your account was made US it would still be US. Did you create a second sub on EU within your same email account?
---
I also started in USA and moved to EU in 2013. They will not/can not xfer an US account to EU. 
---
I ultimately bought a new game/sub as 'EU'. Today I have both a US sub and EU sub within my account. (Naturally the US sub is inactive and EU is active).
---
If you never bought a second sub, but started as US. Then you'd still be US today. I am quite positive blizzard never migrates a US account to become an EU account -- from personal experience trying quite hard to make that happen in 2013.
---
Wtf is a floppy?
---
Hahaha, thanks for letting me hear your opinion.
---
I appreciate the clarity :)
---
Interesting, would you rather that happens before raids release or on the other side of it?
---
As long as they dont mess with the art style or animations who cares if they add some higher options? Computers have changed. I for one dunno if I could play on that old manilla box screen in 720 pixels anymore.
---
Free with your normal sub
---
I can assure you they don't discuss any of the topics you mentioned at Blizz.
---
QuestHelper nearly guarenteed wont work, blizzard intentionally broke it at some point (3.0?). That's not to say you can't create a similar addon
---
the weapon for mage doesn't matter....
---
Get the one with the most +int, or +int and +damage and healing, or the most +damage and healing (but you don't really get into spell power stuff that matters until later.)
---
The other stats on the Sword/Dagger/Offhand/Staff are pointless.
---
I played back in 05, I was 10 then, now I am in my fourth year of uni working on a master's degree so the math works out, still in school
---
Didn't start college till I was 29, and didn't graduate till I was 38.  This was just a 2yr degree, just took forever due to only being able to take one class a term at a time, and having to retake some classes due to failing them.
---
In this case, I'd have to pick both!
---
&gt;we want the hardcore dungeons and raids
---
Then can we all agree they need to be significantly retuned?
---
Source on it being a 2 day beta? Didn't see any date mentions on it, apart from them having stress tests for 2 days
---
No on 2,3,4,5
---
Don't tell me to shut the fuck up, that's childlish and idiotic. Now go back to Towcuck's chat where you can be his loyal fanboy.
---
In what way does having a different looking version of water give anyone an advantage?
---
No timelines posted on phases yet, right? IF we look back at vanilla's timeline, approximately how far after launch would phase 2 and phase 3 take place?
---
ui hidden but his face still there?
---
Some people like different things.
---
The video is unavailable for me, can you watch it? 
---
"Blizzard please fix" could just be a meme, but it's a bit of a stretch.
---
If you knew classic was coming out but didn't keep up with news on it, you don't care very much about it then.
---
That's a bug - there is no skill associated with each spec in Vanilla / classic
---
I don‚Äôt think so for this first wave. Streamers and random mainly for this round.

Haha I know I did
---
If I was actually playing the beta it might actually kill some of the excitement and hype for me personally because I don‚Äôt want to experience classic until the real thing comes. 
---
Just watching the stream increases my excitement, though I might feel different about that by late July or early Aug.
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand a Troll Warrior. The rotation is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the abilities will go over a typical player's head. There's also slam's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into the rotation- its theorycrafting draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these macros, to realise that they're not just necessary- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Troll Warriors truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in a Troll's existential catchphrase "Stay away from the voodoo," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Chris Metzen's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Troll Warrior tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the raid leader's eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé
---
Cap of the Scarlet Skull. Or Scarlet Skullcap. Whatever it's called. Poor man's Nef cloth helm. 2% crit and high Stam and int made it great for PvP.

---
You're reponses were overwhelmingly negative and almost exclusively against Tips. Who are you trying to convince?
---
For somebody as undecided as you are, while simultaneously despising Tips, you sure do seem to watch him alot.
---
Too busy banning abortion to distract the public from the Trump obstruction Mueller report scandal.
---
Can I ask why you dislike BGs? Wow was only out for 7 months prior to them being added. How did it change the game so drastically for someone who doesn't even play those games modes?
---
Hasn't there been an interview where they stated they are open to making changes long term if that's the direction the player-base is interested in going in?
---
This may of been in reference to BC servers, I took it as meaning both. Could be wrong.
---
Damn those Coca Cola commercials!
---
Raises both hands.
---
Any warlock players who were watching mind elaborating on how he was doing overall please? He's made a warlock leveling guide and talks about the subject like he's an authority figure, so I'm curious how much that's actually true.
---
Alliance did not have access to Shamans.
---
Horde did not have access to Paladins.
---
The only races you could play back then were, on Alliance side: Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Night Elf.
---
and Horde: Orc, Troll, Tauren, Undead.
---
Forever my Warchief!
---
Im also one of those who dont have as much time as i did back then. Im now 35, busy job and a little family.
---
A guild which i could tag along raids when i have time or that raids late (and preferably on weekends) is what im looking forward to. Let‚Äôs see what pops up! :D
---
That's how it works, but it's still lame as it's the only Class/Race combo that gets a disadvantageous racial ability.
---
When I played vanilla I was 18, single, living in an apartment as a sophomore in college. I played like 30 hours per week, raid nights 3 times a week. I finally burnt out after about 3 years of playing and haven't touched it since.
---
Now I'm 33, married, with a teenage step son and a 5 month old baby. I have a career, a house, and have kids sports and family events nearly every weekend.
---
Playing vanilla again looks like SO MUCH FUN. But I'm fairly certain I will quickly end up single and living in an apartment again if I even try it.
---
I'm against it. Also, I don't care
---
It's so stupid that people want 2004 coding in a 2019 video game to the point where they want terrible UI setups, input delays, laggy servers, no sharding so you have to wait hours for a quest boss. How stupid can you be? Even OSRS recognized you can still have the original game and stick to its roots while keeping it modern and enjoyable.
---
Username checks out
---
I was 13 in 04. I'm in grad school now. Granted, I didn't play when the game first came out, I've only been playing since the fall.
---
Just play retail if this is what you want, these changes already exist.
---
Yep and a small bite of humble pie there would have done wonders: "wow. That was an embarrassing display. I hope no one was watching that fight just now xD"
---
Would have bypassed so much hate and criticism.
---
This has got to be a meme.
---
Moral of the story: TipsOut is not only a scrub but also a piece of human shit. Stop supporting this manchild with your views.
---
I‚Äôm sure the OP is not going to deny a warlock a party spot.  (I would hope) 
---
I feel they are more asking an objective comparison on damage from a warlock in a 5/10-man capacity.
---
damn i am so excited. I miss being able to just wander randomly in cool realms and get immersed. 
---
I'm guessing the graphics are definitely more demanding than how vanilla was, right? I'll need to upgrade.
---
haha that's funny. charge physics op.
---
Last time I checked this game was a considered a classic and the vast majority agree with this.
---
I remember seeing tons of people during the opening of AQ gates, low fps on my computer and high latency at times, but playable and I saw community. Sharding says hey look here is low ping and high fps and a fraction of your community. Sorry buddy, but I'll take community over technology gimmicks all day. This game became a classic because of community.
---
Again, don't hear people complaining about ghost town servers during Vanilla, just stories and creating amazing friendships and playing an amazing game.
---
I'm very curious how they figure out the "active members" I have a YouTube channel, twitch channel, I've been playing and playing since classic released nonstop every month I have paid, every collector's except classic and BC. Every single class and every race at 120... it sounds like a load of trash, and I for one feel this crap needs to stop.
---
Man, tons of reasons.
---
1) Absolutely garbage content. Videos stretched out to 10 mins so they can monetize them, when it's something they could have wrapped up in 2 mins.
---
2) Stealing content, from each other, from reddit, from 10 year old guides, etc.
---
3) Lack of knowledge - Depends on the youtuber in question, but a lot of them aren't contributing anything new and are just re-iterating things they've heard, which sometimes (often times) are false.
---
4) Streamer babies - They get so much preferential treatment from their fans that they become really annoying to listen to. For instance, there's the one streamer who literally started throwing a fit about a warglaive of azzinoth until the guild gave it to him; even though there were other people who needed it and weren't even allowed to roll. He got it because he had a crowd of followers who would have flamed if he didn't.
---
5) They warp the server balance. Tons of people join up on their server just to piggyback off the streamer. It ruins WPvP since it makes it very lopsided.
---
6) The constant brigade of unnecessary speculation. It's making people rage about things like loot trading, sharding, and the beta when it really wasn't even news in the first place, and everything blizz has released actually looks pretty good.
---
That's just some of the main points why I don't like them, but I'm sure there are more. They do some good to the community and there are plenty of content creators making really informative and useful stuff; but then there's ones like tipsout and azmongold who just don't really seem to do anything for the community. IMO streamers are WAY worse than people who exclusively youtube, but every streamer also has a youtube channel.
---
Out of pure curiosity:
---
What is the difference for you between 1 and 2,3,4?
---
The concern is that Blizzard might actually be listening to his feedback and the feedback of people like him.
---
If sodapoppin is a multi millionaire then you can rest assured all the other moderately big streamers are making decent money. Maybe not millions, but certainly plenty.
---
i see the patch notes for wotlk changing it for mob kills, but this thread from 2007 on wowhead talks about low level quest reputation

Would kind fuck you on Heigan and Thaddius, among others, I'd think. Unless it isn't in PvE for some weird rason.
---
None.
---
You can revive Aeris if you go back and collect the White Materia on Disc 3 and take it back to where Jenova was held in Mt. Coral.
---
Lmao! Yeah, when I found out he played Dark Age of Camelot during my interview, I told him how I lead a 233+ man raid on EK. Needless to say, I obviously got the job. 
---
Nerds FTW.
---
Oh I fully plan on playing Classic, regardless of these get changed ever. They are not deal breaking for me, in the sense of if they are not changed I wouldn't play.
---
I am just curious about what level of changes people are okay with. Quality of life, balancing, etc.
---
I think that's at least a third of us!
---
Jealousy mainly, and a bunch of back seat babies. "omg they just dont understand the vanilla experience LIKE I CAN"
---
Graphics rarely break a game, uncommonly make a game, and more often than not give a game true beauty. Pretty much always, though, they are the first turn off or turn on to a game.
---
Lol lucky, what'd you do?
---
This was something Joana (who, I would argue is the player with the most authority and expertise on this issue) predicted.  
---
Somebody leveled 1-60 in a bit over 3 days on a private server relatively recently (it might have been Joana himself? I forget though. Don't quote me on that specific point). And Joana said hey, that's neat and all, but it's not representative of vanilla, and it won't be representative of Classic. Certainly his vanilla record will fall, since players are MUCH better at the game than he was in 2006, and there's far more people who are interested in speed running. However, private server XP values are not accurate and not indicative of how long it took to level in vanilla.
---
None ever or none for now?
---
Just interested in your opinion :)
---
Healer was looting the gem from the boss as the tank pulled. Tank was NOT full health, ran directly away from the healer to immediately pull the boss and tank from the far side of the boss, ignoring the healer's location and mana level.
---
Which video did you watch? 0% healer's fault.
---
It's people like this that made me stop playing WoW on private servers: self-absorbed, immature, playing more than anything to aggravate others (in order to be able to reply "Hey, it was funny to 'need' the item just to destroy it - it's just a game!"), not anywhere near as good as they believe they are, and, ultimately, with no interest in what WoW used to be for most people way back - a world to live in. You didn't need to RP to feel that way. Instead, it's speed leveling (which it even isn't given that rushing straight into a wall at full speed isn't that fast if you want to get through it) and reading up online on what to min-max for, while collecting the current top raid tier level items ("There's \*literally\* nothing else to do in the game!" as I heard on private servers). 
---
If this will be the world I'll join in August, it'll be a one-month subscription for me.
---
The funny part is this guy was all over private servers for the past year. I remember seeing him leveling and leading a roaming gank squad through Ashencvale of like 60 horde when the server who won‚Äôt be named was fresh last summer. He has no excuse to be this bad at vanilla
---
Since when can mages use maces
---
Hahaha you're one toxic fucker, know that? God I hope you play Alliance
---
Well yeah that's usually how it works. Reddit is stupid and rewards people for being shitty. Most recent example: destiny mass posted spoilers and look what happened to his view count. Skyrocketed.
---
Yeah the guild I joined is looking to do 1 weekend night of raiding. Horde PvE. Looks like everyone is around that 30-35 range. Really enjoying just chatting with these people on discord already so it should be fun.
---
Blizzard is in control of how many keys they're willing to send out, so of course they could invite 5 or 5 million people.  Their method for calculating the amount of invites available is known only to them.  It might even be arbitrary, but more than likely they've figured out how many people they want playing the game right now and have sent out the appropriate amount of invites.
---
I think the hype for Classic is at a peak right now and weighing that against potential bugs, it probably occurred to them that they should push advertisement for it right now while it's buzzing/trending.  It's also entirely possible that Blizzard reached out to streamers and said "Hey, we can get you into Beta if you sign this NDA and then commit to X hours of streams a week."  But you're right, we don't know.  
---
I can't and am not speaking for Blizzard, this is just me rationalizing objectively why they would be withholding invites to prominent mainstays of the Classic community.  I think it's good to set aside biases and look at it from the company's point of view and if more people did that, we'd get less outrage overall.
---
I would agree if this was retail wow. The devs on the Classic team seem to actually care. They listen to the community more than any other dev team at Blizzard and seem to genuinely care about making this the most authentic they can. They have gone on record to say that Phase 2 is the absolute latest they will have layering because of world bosses, if that means people will have to wait in a queue then so be it. That is enough for me to simmer down. I highly suspect that most servers will be merged well before phase 2, the popular servers will lag behind that curve for obvious reasons but will still have the hard cap of Phase 2.
---
Its a circle jerk when it isn't even on topic to the thread. Its like me making a thread with the title, "Whats your favorite instance?" and you come in and atart posting how you hate Leatherworking because its a shit profession.
---
I am 6'5 and 240 lbs, so I'd say I am a big angry man.
---
But yeah I agree. Fuck you
---
Yeah they never shuffled like that idk what he‚Äôs talking about. If you made a new char they were stuck where they were for good.
---
Some are cool to watch, some are spoiled manchilds who thinks they deserve special treatment cuz theyre streamers: 
---
https://youtu.be/eWAdB8IEb_o?t=176
---
I'm watching the stream right now and they're actively testing things I didn't know about. These are the kind of people blizzard want for their beta and I certainly am not them.
---
Absolutely no one does that ever /s rofl
---
I try to avoid noisy stupid people irl. So how can i find love for those who force unto others over youtube?
---
Pretty much every piece of software ever. "This is broken". Okay well how is it broken or what did you do to break it? "Idk its just broken"
---
lol, if I'm going to spend all my gold on repairs from dying all the time, how will I afford respeccing for dungeons?
---
I THINK that's a bug. Maybe.
---
To be fair, I could see it never happening and the game staying in its base form forever. If thats really what the majority of the community wants.
---
Take heart young one!
---
The OP changed his comment about switching to agility gear when in combat because agi =dodge...
---
The healer was looting the fucking quest item. Christ I hope I don't play with any of you retards.
---
this is the only real answer, but it'll get downvoted to shits because you're not allowed to complain on this sub
---
My reason is that for over a year they have given inaccurate information(front backstab, /sit criting etc). I am appreciative of the passion and promoting of classic they have done but this Beta has shown how off they have been. There are some really good ones though which are not as popular.
---
Retail.  Maybe not directly related to classic, but still related to WOW.
---
Barber shop would be fine by me, nothing else on your list tho.
---
It is freakish how this is exactly what I was thinking and then boom, there is is when I click!
---
I get what you're saying, I really do, however Blizzard said at this time they are willing to bring back Vanilla/Classic WoW the way it was; not the way some people want it to be, not to fix old mistakes, and not to try a new path to see if a better option could have been done.
---
Nost and the other PServers showed that there is an interest in the **original game****,** with all its perceived flaws and imbalance. Yes, some are downright stupid issues that could be a quick fix that would have little to no impact on the gameplay, as your changes suggest, but thats not the point; what they are giving us is an opportunity to play the game the way it was, with no changes be them QoL or game changing.
---
So how about we let people get these months/years of enjoyment, the good and the bad, how it was. Then once we see how successful it is let Blizzard and the community decide how they should proceed in the future.
---
What would be your preferred cut off for new servers then? End at BC? WotLK? Cata?
---
At some point aren't we just reliving the things that we didn't like from those xpacs too? 
---
I guess I am more for a design philosophy than simply letting me relive exactly what I experienced 10-15 years ago with a launch. I don't want to grind for my mana-ray mount again in BC hahah
---
Skorch is at 25 now, seen on Asmons stream
---
Supply and demand
---
Even back in the day, I‚Äôd like to actually see weather effecting you. Say, higher miss chance when raining. Longer casting time during sand storm. Longer HP/Mana regeneration for snow. Just to make everything harder.
---
Okay with sharding, dungeonfinder and flying
---
Thottbot was a thing... before thot was thot
---
Pretty much no to all of that. All of that list ruins the gameplay of Classic.
---
If you want things added it would have to be something that doesn‚Äôt change that.
---
Say like a client side only graphics option...
---
Class balance passes might happen but will be frowned upon if it changes the meta too much.
---
Besides, let‚Äôs just get to August and go through 2 years of stuff before we try to tackle this beast
---
Pretty sure that's always been a thing.
---
I actually went and gave them follows (I don't watch almost any streaming) just for this. I applaud you gentlemen.
---
Wait, is it a closed beta? How do you get in
---
This is probably the idea that receives the most vitriol if you dare bring it up, yet I've not seen a compelling reason for this. I'm confused as to why many specs in the game being completely pointless is crucial to the vanilla experience. 
---
I get the feeling that if this happened people would be terrified the blatantly overpowered shit they play might get brought in line. Maybe that's it. 
---
The people I actually played vanilla with are all in favor of a minor pass to allow more people to enjoy the game /shrug
---
Anywhere there's a virtual economy there is real money involved. Anywhere real money is involved, there's people who'll exploit whatever they can to make money. Gold farmers have always and will always exist. It's really up to Blizzard to stop the bots, though.
---
Sodapoppin Litteraly took a month+ off streaming several times, came back, and still had the same (if not bigger) audience.
---
This may be true of smaller streamers, but the big ones really can decide their schedule.
---
Hi, /u/Aconceptthatworks
---
How resource heavy is it?
---
We did it in about 38 min with a pally tank and me as holy priest healing. It wasn't hard with that group. In other groups there was always one or two people who couldn't make the adjustment from playing "well" to managing their own mana and health efficiently.
---
My worry is that few will put up with it since the actual set is not strictly worth the effort for most classes.
---
I didn't play in 04, found out about it mid 05 in 7th grade, boy did my life change then lmfao.
---
Wow, this really aged like a fine casserole!

Level are different, spirit is drastically different. What did your tests show when re-creating the issue with all things being equal? Are you sure there weren't changes to regen across different patches? Changes to how spirit affects regen?

Might want to get that checked out buddy

Does not appear to be in this build, no. Doesn't mean it wont be in when it launches but it appears to not be in this build

Less of a problem than it has been in the past. WoW tokens kinda removed a lot of the gold sellers, since people can buy gold straight through blizz now. Also, gold is just a lot less important/valuable than it was back in classic... You can get the gold for all of your mounts very easily just by playing, it's not like vanilla/TBC where you actually needed to have a plan to get the 1k/5k/10k for mounts.
---
We'll have to see, it could be an issue, but it's more up to Blizz to implement good monitoring to prevent gold sellers.
---
Because I'm not trying to hate? Just saying that the later a person started the more of a learning curve they will have in classic. He expressed all of this in a simple "he started in cata" comment which you asked for clarification on and I provided.
---
What is it?
---
Shit, I got my first job at McDonald's when I was 14 specifically so I could afford to play when it released.
---
Oh yeah, that guy hits like a fucking truck for his level.
---
Totally respect your opinion, thanks for wording it so well. This is a solid argument for no changes.
---
Yup, I was using thottbot though, and since I started 2 weeks after release, all my friends had a bit of info if I had got stuck too.
---
Still need to know what macros work too.
---
Because it's cool to like classic wow now, duh
---
Thanks for your input :)
---
Out of curiosity, why the barber shop over the others?
---
I agree. I would at least want a toggle.
---
You retarded ?
---
It uses the BfA API. Why would a 8.x client use the Legion API?
---
I am looking forward to full-functional quest tracking. On the Siberian servers I currently play, like many private servers before it, often times a quest will not track, the values will not properly increment, or it will display multiple instances of the same quest. This seems like a UI issue and I hope Classic resolves it. :)
---
1. Get a bag mod.
---
2. No.
---
3. No.  But I'd be OK if you wanted to toggle new models for YOUR view of them.
---
4. Yes.
---
5. No
---
6. No.
---
people with better graphics cards always had an advantage.
---
Well, we don't know they aren't, but I get what you are saying.
---
Oh I don't think they are for all the changes people are asking for, including the 6 that I said I would be interested in :)
---
Some people (mistakenly) think that the water in Vanilla didn't have any transparency to the surface of it as opposed to the newer water rendering of today, and thus people could hide under it to avoid PvP. When they are completely misremembering.
---
[Proof in an earlier comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpcpb2/to_the_people_complaining_about_the_graphics/enslifv/)
---
I don't have a problem with content creators getting keys first, even ones that didnt play vanilla.  It's mostly done for advertising and I get it.
---
But.... clearly a lot of people left out feel like they can contribute to the bug reporting, some streamers are not taking that part seriously. Some of the big streamers (not all, of course) have openly scoffed at people telling them to report bugs because they are too busy enjoying the game. That runs me the wrong way personally.
---
You‚Äôre actually retarded if you think that.
---
Yes, they're cosmetic and right now only available for allied races, dwarves and Blood elfs.  They are releasing gnome and tauren heritage armor in the next patch and more to be announced in the future.
---
I got a few recently for retro consoles. They're nice but probably not worth it. When the set I have eventually dies I'm over it.
---
No stats u casual
---
Asmon is the most entertaining and low key sarcastic. He knows a lot about the game but i wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs great at playing it. Watching him he might tell you something you didn‚Äôt know but won‚Äôt impress you with his gameplay prowess. 
---
He doesn‚Äôt take himself too seriously, and doesn‚Äôt have some overbearing 1337 ego.
---
He did take time to warm up to.
---
This is just my opinion.
---
Yeah dungeons aren't a joke in Vanilla.
---
You have to take everything seriously, and often times with some caution and patience.
---
It was incredibly satisfying.
---
I was in a guild that raided maybe 3 times a week but because of their schedule I could only make it on Saturday nights. They were nice enough to let me join even though I was bad dps. I ended the expansion with a mix of UBRS, aq20, MC, Ony and BWL gear.
---
hey that's what happened to &lt;every single fun niche subculture&gt;
---
In what ways would you say cosmetic changes ruin the gameplay of Classic? Not saying I don't agree with you, just interested in your opinion
---
Alliance have the pally and horde has the shaman
---
Dude, I havent been in a college class room in like... 9 years now.

I was playing last night and it would auto populate when I killed the correct mob or picked up a quest item
---
I would like to see to the end of WotLK. After that I personally don't believe the game went in a great direction, I think that opinion is shared by a few people.
---
Some would even argue WotLK was where the wrong turn was taken however I loved that expansion for the narrative and end game, as well as the time in my life I played it and the people I played with.
---
That's exactly what classic is though, a reliving of the past forgotten.
---
Or for those who were not able to experience it, a discovery of the origins of the story.
---
The Scarlet Crusaders in Deathknell were aggressive, as well.
---
Here's priority for raid spots.
---
Show up on time/consistently
---
Know mechanics/stay alive
---
Be good at your class
---
Proper specs/raid comp.
---
The only time I would enforce specs is if we are not geared or possibly naxx and aq progression. Everything else is show up and don't suck. Make the effort get the rewards
---
Thanks for the input. It is interesting to see how many people would be interested in a barber over everything else
---
easier to see through?
---
There's a lot of "If it was good enough for my father its good enough for me!" whinging going on.
---
I played in '06 when I was 6 years old! I had no idea what I was doing but I was doing it
---
Really hard to gear up a warrior though (obviously hard for everyone in vanilla) but warriors had it rough
---
lol rip Asmongold
---
What the fuck is a vanilla vet? Private servers are not god damn vanilla. 
---
I got in and played from closed beta to BC non-stop, but I've never touched a pserver. I don't have a photographic memory but it certainly feels spot on to me.
---
&gt; There probably others doing the same but the majority seem to be just leveling or doing dungeons terribly (seriously Tipsout getting lost in WC?!?! How!?!?!)
---
Playing like a regular player is still a valid form of testing, assuming they're reporting inconsistencies/errors/bugs/etc.
---
What the fuck?
---
I think we‚Äôre the same person. Started playing at the same age and we‚Äôre both 24. Only difference is that I dropped out of school for a PhD last year.
---
Where I'm from, absolute minimum for an engineering degree + masters is 6 years. Regular time is 7. But the whole thing is ridiculously hard, so it's common for it to take 8 like it did for me (and that's not counting the years I took in-between to make some money).
---
So, doctors, PhDs and a ton of other exceptions...
---
If you didn't have your settings up or the sub time on before then, do you not get in at all now until next beta?
---
People aren't being dazed enough when running from mobs (with their back to them)
---
but an FOV slider wasn't in vanilla...If they add an FOV slider. It would become the thing you started this thread over.
---
Man it‚Äôs very difficult to afford a $300 Lexus like mine
---
Or a $1500 Supra like mine
---
Or a $3200 V8 6spd BMW like mine 
---
Sooo expensive, no one can ever save that up!
---
And what about when that philosophy changes? Blizzard adds new content based on what they think the players want, but then original classic is gone. 
---
*This literally happened 13 years ago. We've been through this. It took the community 13 years to get their game back. Stop trying to ruin this for them.*
---
I've got a friend who never played before.  Hes going to take his time, actually read quest dialog and shit
---
A lot of people won't play a game until they see a stream playing it.
---
I haven't gotten into this beta but have gotten into others. I am pretty sure they don't just pick streamers. It's either random or possibly based on play time. Either way I am hoping to get in.
---
At least this time to West Coast my ping will be 180-220 instead of 260-350 because of 2005 era routing and overall ISP quality.
---
I did, and still am.
---
Not saying I was any good, but ten level 5 characters never hurt anyone.
---
I just scheduled three weeks off myself. I'm going to revert to a garbage human being for that period of time, and it's not going to be pretty
---
They are magically summoned entities so no.
---
If you think something might need to change, just don't post it. Dont. You're losing karma and your sanity.
---
Classic wasnt perfect but it was classic and it's what we want back.
---
Cynical people will always be the best testers. They want to find the flaws.
---
I still have issues coming to terms with the fact that people are willing to intentionally make the game worse for their group members and other people are okay with that.
---
Because changing the way your characters face and hair looks isnt a big deal. I literally wouldn't care if people wanted to do that, as long as it stopped there. It doesn't change how the game plays or feels or anything like that
---
Where did I claim that?
---
With the remake of FFVII announced I'm hopeful to see rogue/hunter/warlocks named XxsephirothxX or xCloud69x or some combo.  These were the cringe names I remember from 2004.
---

---
Guy's signoff is "Tips out, babe". I mean, it shouldn't exactly be a surprise.
---
Nah, a lot of those effects in the rain here are a product of modern technologies.
---
A few of us (i expect 5-10 in the first 2-3 weeks) will. The others will help us switching layers when we need it. It won't interrupt their questing.
---
Do the updated graphics include things like updated effects for spells, abilities, etc.? 
---
I've tried watching some streams on twitch but it seems everyone is playing with the older graphical settings. I'm sure I just didn't dive deep enough into streams to find out....
---
oh yeah I was super pissed at the time
---
&gt; The name of zone in center of screen when it's changed
---
Are you talking about when you go from, for example, Elwynn Forest and into Westfall?
---
I was looking at the end of their run and was feeling anxious for their tank, 2 warriors charging right in and a rogue jumping out of stealth in places where the mobs will spawn. I know it's just WC and stuff, but why not wait the few seconds and actually nuking one target to make it easier xD
---
You're the first person I've seen articulate this argument, and I get the concern as they're not unfounded.
---

‚ÄúThat wouldn't have been my goal, that SoR is the proccing seal and SotC isn't.‚Äù
---
So suck it, Tardigrade89. Ah this is such sweet, sweet justice.
---
Because Classic/Vanilla has a very limited set of gear. Visually you get used to what each item looks like and any effects they might have.
---
So fights just aren‚Äôt about the class it‚Äôs about their gear along with skill. You play around all of that. You add a ‚ÄúTransmog‚Äù you hide that ability to plan around that.

---
My dad sat me down in 05 and taught me how to do mithril runs in winterspring, I was 4 years old... I was my dad's own personal Chinese gold farmer and I made enough gold to farm an epic mount when I was 4... Nobody will ever again have the excuse "it's to hard to grind that much gold"
---
Wow arnt you big brained.
---
I think it's safe to assume that most bugs will be "subtle" like the regen issues and this clip.
---
Extremely obvious bugs have probably been mostly ironed out.
---
Yeah I am terribly toxic, lets me get the lash of shame and whip myself. How many until I can regain the approval of the mainstream sir? 
---
You're pathetic lmao. I am sure your whiteknighting will get you far ;)
---
So suck it, Theloras. Ah this is such sweet, sweet justice.
---
I love building twinks, it‚Äôs literally all I did as a kid. Me and my brother didn‚Äôt have enough money for 2 accounts so we would take turns. He was like level 55 as a warlock and I never made it past 30 because I loved making twinks. I would make money on his character farming elemental fire in ungoro and then mailing myself money for enchants, gear and money to pay people to run me through dungeons. I loved it. Once you finally got to a point you were happy with, going in and play wsg was so much fun, I plan to do it again in August.
---
So I have previously tried classic WoW on private servers and enjoyed it. Do you guys think I‚Äôll get burned out if I start leveling on a private server before launch because I wasn‚Äôt a sub nor important enough to get closed beta. Just want to try to familiarize myself with the zones more so when launch is out I don‚Äôt get fucked.
---
I have no idea how to call it, I have never raided myself in vanilla. Here's the video:

As I recall you needed 3-5 people in the party at a kill in order to trigger a group bonus.
---
Well streamers are not content creators, they just stream a game they're playing and act like entitled babies while doing so.
---
Especially when it had taken them 2 hours to finish that instance
---
Thanks for the solid answers and reasoning being them.
---
I hadn't looked at the pet loyalty aspect of food, totally understand your opinion about it
---
Out of curiosity, why no balancing changes? What if it happened after the raids and not before? Legit just curious
---
Well I believe they're recruiting. If you're interested I can hook you up with the GM's discord and you can have a chat with him. Shoot me a PM if this interests you.

I'm assuming your speaking for raiding gear only which sort of not entirely true. I was speaking about quest/factions/professions/toys/mounts, and it also seems like this expansion had the most reputations.
---
Hell I only speak English and WoW taught me a lot of words above my age when I first started playing. How many 12 year olds do you know who say shit like "conjure" or "subtlety"
---
You can't claim slippery slope fallacy when the entire timeline of World of Warcraft over the past 15 years shows that it is, in fact, a slippery slope leading from "improvements" to LFR, sharding, and weekly slot machines. 
---
*The slippery slope happened. That's literally how we got here.*
---
I would say it could run Vanilla but idk how the 8.0 engine will effect the requirements, interesting question
---
It's probably even more doable now with how much information everyone has about vanilla. You guys could prob just spend the week running dungeons and farming matts and spend a couple hours one day a week clearing raids. My guild was a very late guild as all of us hit 60 about 6 months before TBC came out. Everyone knew all of the strats because some of them had friends in older guilds that explained everything to our raid leader or would even come in to help out.
---
of what ?

More time to try to get the complete defias leather set.

I played a prot paladin a bit on a priv server, was holy for raiding, but respecced to get stuff done with guild when DireMaul came out, TPS and holding AoE threat was a breeze in 5 man consecrate and a lot of reflect dmg from aura and thorns, nagelring, holy shield, shield spike etc. I was apparently easy to heal, because you block a lot. Probs don't want SoC, as righteousness is every hit and more reliable, especially with no taunt. 
---
Elephant in the room. You don't have a taunt, which is a limitation, however you can use BoP as a defacto taunt if someone does get aggro off you, so long as you are second on threat and they wont immediately be above the threshold to pull it back when BoP fades you're good. It's hard to rip threat off a prot paladin that has mana. There's also the rationale that if taunt is needed someone done fucked up, they were either hitting the wrong thing or not paying attention to threat meter. I'd say it's less of a problem in classic than in private servers because you wont be having DPS warriors needing to taunt off you, to sit and proc enrage expecting you to taunt it straight back, because the sit forced crit procs interaction won't work in classic. 
---
Raids are a different beast, as you don't have mana to sustain max TPS for very long. Although now I think about it, fights aren't very long either with stacked groups, so it's swings and roundabouts. Between mana pots and runes, you're probably going to be able to just about sustain. Taunt in raids on most bosses is a none issue as they weren't tauntable and was based off threat gen to switch, so having the paladin start, burn his mana pool and the other tank taking over may be viable. Notable exceptions being ebonroc with the debuff that you taunt, but i suppose with good paladins across the board can always BoP the debuff... and 4HM switches you'd not be able to do, at all. That's probably where you keep a healing set in your bags. That's me really thinking and it's 1 fight in the entirety where there wouldn't be a workaround. 
---
You can make it work for you, but it will be a lot of effort. People will be skeptical, and you'll have to deal with that. You'd be farming mana consumables, like magebloods, and and tank consumables like titans. for much later fights where warriors would be chaining stoneshield pots, and you'd need yours for mana, you might not be viable either.  
---
I'd wait to see what happens down the line in classic beta and beyond, as I have a feeling fury tanking won't be legit. We didn't suck so much dick in vanilla that we (cutting edge raiders) didn't think of things like that, gift of arthas pots, prepotting stoneshields. Depends on the formulas, CoR is a must for every boss on private, but I remember some janky interactions with it back in the day with boss specials hitting super hard so we just left it off for the most part.  
---
TLDR: there's plenty of people that tried it on private servers, there's a beta, if you know and understand the limitations, both of the class and the community... and accept it might not work going in, give it a go!
---
WoW tokens won't be in classic though, fortunately.
---
Thank you for the nice laugh
---
Omega lul. Imagine being shit at the game but reporting it as a bug... not sure the right people got the beta access
---
1. no  
---
2. no
---
3. no
---
4. yes
---
5. 50/50  
---
6. yes
---
Nah, this was entirely the healer and tank's fault.  The DPS still managed to get the boss pretty low even without a tank.
---
/r/KenM
---
Thank you for this. Already connected with an old guildmate. Now we are already forming new guild to run when Classic comes out. At this rate, we may have around 40 for the guild at release. 
---
Used to play on the Aggramar server as a horde mage. Also moved to Argent Dawn server around WotLK. Hit me up if you knew me on either server.
---
Some people here just look for something to be angry about.
---
The murlocs in Elwynn are a scourge for level 8-10 players. Shit's not a joke
---
Sigh, yeah, I'm so tired of people complaining about this.
---
Y'all, Layering is just basically glorified server merging.
---
Instead of having Lightninghoof, Daggerspine, Blackrock, Frostwolf and Pink Pony server, you'll just have Lightninghoof.  Except Lightninghoof will actually be multiple servers in "one" - Lightninghoof 1, Lightninghoof 2, Lightninghoof 3, etc.
---
They'll remain that way for a few weeks until player levels even out.  Then the Lightninghoof iterations will be merged into a single Lightninghoof.  The alternative would be having Lightninghoof, Daggerspine, Blackrock, Frostwolf and Pink Pony, and then running the risk that in 2-3 months all five servers have inadequate player counts because of the inflated launch numbers.
---
This method helps ensure one healthy server, as opposed to multiple desolate servers.
---
I cannot find the source but I do remember reading Tauren had about 2.5 yd additional melee range.
---
The pupil has become the master.
---
The one mod i absolutely want to work is Bagnon.  Ive tried other bag mods, but even with errors here and there i always go back to Bagnon.  Its also one of the first mods i ever downloaded.
---
This is going to muddy up those \#nochange arguments...
---
First and foremost, just because you don't like something, doesn't mean it's a "problem" that needs to be "solved". Classic is supposed to have RPG heavier elements, heterogeneous class design etc.
---
Point 2 and 6 is just outright trying to make classic into retail, this is the same path to nowhere repeated again.
---
Your "harmless" ideas aren't "improving" the game, they are what destroyed it.
---
This is why nobody dares talk about even the little things because you will eventually have retail players bunching up all kinds of changes to gameplay to fit their ideas of how it should be. Because using consumables, having different class aspects or whatever else doesn't fit them and the game then for them needs "QoL", streamling, normalisation and become ever easier one change after another until there is no game left to play.
---
Why would you even want to remove pet food mechanics? What's next, ammo removed, quivers, all consumables and RP elements?
---
Why don't you play retail, it has all of the things you want.
---
I've ran a late night weekend 10pm PST raiding guild from BC to Legion basically.  Not active at the moment but will be for classic.  I never had to do 40 man stuff (as a guild leader) but im sure there will be plenty of late night players.  My vanilla guild was also a late night guild that someone else ran i was just a member so they will certainly exist and we did everything other than naxx.
---
I'm okay with this change as well, since it's more of a buggy thing and less of a QoL improvement. It's literally just an annoyance when you have full bags of quest items and are trying to turn in all your quests but have to stop and drop stuff every time just to give the NPC your quest item. This makes plenty of sense to leave in to me.
---
They have always allowed multi-boxing, as it requires additional subscriptions it's just extra money for them.
---
The only limit is that 1 keypress = 1 action on 1 character. So long as you don't break that rule, you're probably fine.
---
Yeah there is nothing against multiboxing in the ToS. Blizz has acknowledged it and is fine with it
---
Just to reinforce, I re-watched from Tips‚Äô perspective (I don‚Äôt watch it regularly), but he wasn‚Äôt really doing anything wrong most of the time. He was clearly inexperienced and maybe used to it being easier than on Classic, but Soda was riding him pretty hard. Tips told them multiple times that he couldn‚Äôt tank because he was under level and under geared.
---
This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they are mostly all equally annoying....
---
They've always been OK with multiboxing.
---
It was allowed in vanilla and has been allowed ever since. Lots of people on here will tell you they should ban multiboxers but they will almost definitely allow it with the same old rules.
---
Thanks for the guffaw in my cubicle.
---
I don't think anyone who watches his stream played classic either... Or was even alive during classic.
---
Everybody else is a load of bullcorn
---
Im sorry... but... meh.
---
Colorblind was confirmed back in November bro...
---
Wands are awesome
---
Assumptions are all there is when we're given so little information. It's really not so far-fetched to suppose Silithus wouldn't be sharded based on this quotation.
---
Healer stopped healing to lolwtf at the tank dying. Alround good times.
---
Thank god
---
It will be allowed as it always has been and rightfully should be

I love that weather!

I personally would say no to all. I'll just give 2. as an example. Along that line of thinking, why have ammo for hunters anymore? Then why should Warlocks be capped at soulshards in their bags, just have them stacks of 20 instead of 1. The list goes on and on. I'm not trying to flame. Think it through though, not having pets require food would dent the economy and dramatically change the experience and you'll have other classes demanding QoL changes. Just sayin', ;)
---
He said the Regen was about half what it was in private servers.
---
NE female has been the best character model the entire game.
---
Because Classic is based on the Legion client and not BFA.
---
that's not how "advertising" strategies works. Why do you think we still get new coca-coal commercials every Christmas even though man kind have known about it for over 100+ years?  
---
Surely everyone "knows" about it, right?
---
If one does  not have beta key yet,are there still a chance of receiving one?
---
Tauren hunters would be impossible to deadzone.
---
Got out right before WotLK, and classic is exactly what I've been wanting to get back into WoW. Especially now that I'm out of school and working a job and have the sub money available.
---
Speed leveling warlocks will quite often pay the gold at 40 to get a real mount so their regeneration is not interrupted. 
---
I'm not saying it should be changed, but the whole mana thing is actually impactful.
---
"**Warlock:** This is the only class where clicking "Random" on the name is acceptable. If it's good enough for your pets, its good enough for you. "
---
\*giggle\*
---
So, meaningless trash that no one except collectors care about?
---
Hehe, not trying to defend anyone here, but I'd blame soda for that one too.
---
During the run Soda is actively encouraging Tips to just go, so that's what he did.
---
Charging out of healing range was clearly a bad idea, but nobody was expecting the damage that boss was able to dish out. Soda is not even paying attention to Tips' hp, he's more focused on casting moonfire and wrath on the boss itself. Charging out of healing range in my experience is something a majority of warriors do if they're inexperienced or experienced enough to know how much beating they can take.
---
The impression I got from this run is that Tips is really inexperienced with vanilla and wow mechanics in general. I don't believe anyone who's played this game that long can fail so many jumps in WC. He doesn't strike me as someone who has much experience playing at all, but he seems to have done a buttload of research on the game.
---
Soda is a multiple rank 1 gladiator feral druid in wotlk+, but he's just not playing as good as he thinks he is in vanilla. The impression I get from watching him is that he's so used to being the godlike feral that he rarely spend time analyzing his own gameplay to optimize or find mistakes. It's like he's a 70 year old driver who's so used to driving the way they did 50 years ago and therefore driving on autopilot and refusing to see anything wrong with it.
---
One example is one pull when he was running a little low on mana and all of the group was on 50% ish hp he decided to hit everyone up with a rejuvenation, which is like 25% less mana efficient than Healing Touch. That would be fine if everyone was taking damage, but Tips had every mob attacking himself. Eventually they had to kite the remaining mobs because he couldn't heal the tank anymore.
---
I could definitely be wrong about this, or potentially just have a bas case of backseat gaming, but I don't think I am. Soda is a good player, but in vanilla he's not a gladiator equivalent player, especially not as a healer. Tips seems knowledgable, but inexperienced. They're both dicks, though, and imo not very enjoyable to watch.
---
well yeah but the other guy was acting like geared warriors weren't super powerful in vanilla, when we have PvP videos that show that private server warriors are pretty much the same as vanilla in terms of damage capability
---
Whats the max level for the beta?
---
Many multi-boxers break that rule so I don't think that's actually a rule.
---
Nice, thats what I was thinking.
---
I could see doing WC if you were horde as it is in the Barrens, but nfw if you are Alliance.
---
Everyone on the subreddit is pissy they didnt get a key.
---
Before level 30 the chance to be dazed from mobs is much more slim, this was a change that happened during vanilla that private servers did not implement. This is not a bug on the beta.
---
Tell me you played on Dark Iron, where PA and Player vs Player formed rival sides. I was a little runt who liked to drop Chuck Norris bombs in general Barrens chat while I was leveling at the time.
---
Nameplates don't show up at long range, and I think any advantage, no matter how small, needs to be looked at, _especially_ if it isn't in line with the original game.
---
I'm thinking there's not much dialogue to be had with you, though.
---
Cool !
---
Thanks a lot for the reply mate. 380 subs for 100 average viewers seems like a very weird ratio to me, and he says he's in a very generous niche - but still, that's a lot of fucking money. Again, thank you for replying.
---
envy is a terrible color but you wear it well
---
correct.
---
yep
---
Thanks a lot!
---
This is why i hate sorting this sub by new....the most moronic posts down here i swear.
---
clean shaven and fit, thank you very much. Next time stick with your NPC script and tell me to have sex
---
There are all sorts of ways to contribute to testing. If you want to go out of your way to try to break the game and help them fix shit, that's useful. 
---
It's also useful to just play the game normally, especially when we're talking about what is essentially an open beta with no NDA. They are collecting data based on things you're doing, and you're likely to find important bugs. 
---
I've been in many many betas over the years, and if you're not doing a narrow focus test with explicit instructions, there's nothing wrong with just playing the game. 
---
I have to say I find some of the feverish jealousy kind of unsettling. Like this "It should be me! I'm a world class beta tester who will fix the game, no one else can be trusted" crap is not the behavior of a well-adjusted person lol.
---
It‚Äôs just a tempest in a teapot. Stop your squallin‚Äô.
---
more graveyards
---
remove any design decisions made due to technical limitations, that includes limited debuff slots and spell batching
---
some specs need to be made more viable, give prot pally a taunt maybe
---
game needs to be enjoyable, not allowing people to use certain weapons/cast certain skills because debuffs are going to be pushed off the table is not fun, spending 20 mins after a wipe to do corpse run is not fun, getting paladins to buff a 40 man raid every 5 mins is not fun, spending 10 days played time to get a character to 60 just to realise he is severely outclassed in what you want him to do is not fun
---
It really isn't a hard concept to understand is it? I can't fathom how people are struggling with this. This is better than sharding IMHO. This is better than every scenario that I (or my friends) can come up with. If people have a problem with not trusting the devs then thats a whole different problem and deserves a different conversation.
---
I sure hope there will.
---
does not really matter, high enough to not get crushing blows (only 2 levels from the boss)
---
entertainment is a service
---
Yeah I dont understand how is WoW OBS addon didnt remove all ingame elementsüò†üò† bug reports inc
---
&gt; na getting lost is fine,
---
Yea NGL, I ran WC probably, more than 10 less than 20 times across my various characters back in vanilla and got lost in there a lot even later on.
---
I can check when I get off work but I thought i heard addons were not enabled at all currently for this phase of testing.
---
Yes it did
---
I saw a warlock on K3 w/ a Void named Charlos, guess the name bank is the same !
---
sick burn, bruh. I better break out the aloe now
---
based fanboy
---
Guy makes a thread asking a legitimate question about warlock advantages and disadvantages. 
---
Guy is answered by condescending asshats who proceed to give the most mature, well thought out answer ever devised by man: "uh BECAUSE"
---
I wonder why people say  this sub is toxic.
---
Probably will be via an addon but its looking like the numbers have are what we will get, time will tell tho
---
Mages named Dracarys.
---
I have done the hardcore realm first grind.  I am going to go a little slower paced this time and spend more copper and silver on ales.
---
It's a premade.
---
Going from 9 hours to 14 is an order of magnitude by definition.
---
You will not be able to raid full naxx but you will certainly be able to raid MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 and you might see some AQ40 bosses
---
A slider wouldn‚Äôt interfere with your VR adventure though, and wow that sounds like fun!
---
Beta is a great time to bring these things up. They literally may not know about these small issues
---
What changes would you be okay with? ---- None. Besides they need to be changed for the new s erver system bla
---
Lol, Buttstuff.  I think I remember that being a thing.
---
I'm sure you know 100% about everything in vanilla WoW :)
---
I hope Blizzard sees this and leaves him out of the equation in the future
---
I haven‚Äôt watched all his videos but he never claimed to be an authority afaik.
---
These soft ass kids can barely beat these easy games we have today. Maybe 10% will last. I hope I'm wrong, but the crying that will ensue when this game goes live will be legendary. I'm fully expecting it during the beta too.  I just hope the devs stay strong. Wow classic for hardcore people. Retail for the kiddies.
---
Penny Arcade did this against Player vs Player back in the day.
---
Telling adults how to live their lives is obnoxious.
---

---
I'm thinking you ran out of things to complain about.
---
This whole thread is a garbage fire holy shit
---
Easy there fascist Trumper
---
Could be both? I don't know if the Classic setting affects weather?
---
I'm like 99% sure that quest return arrows were introduced in BC. I remember having them for a q in STV where you had to find a chest that worked as a quest turn in npc. Bookie something something.
---
The classicast people wear red "Make azeroth great again" hats.
---
It's really not surprising to me that they're assholes.
---
Wow, fuck that. I can see why people want to avoid streamer servers at all costs.
---
Floating combat text is what its called i think. It looks likeon beta theyve got a weird hybrid of legion and vanilla damage text( the way it pops up and stacks.) I really hope they fix this as well
---
Never had any arrows or map indicators in late vanilla, early TBC when I started. Had to use an add-on for that
---
Would someone be able to sum up for me where the appeal is for racing to level 30 on a temporary client designed to hunt down bugs and inaccuracies?
---
Hahah. Look at Mr mini-dick over here losing the argument so he has to flex his oh so impressive cars.
---
Nobody cares, and your cars do not change the facts above.
---
This isn't about you, you narcissistic little loser. This is *not. about. you.*
---
The reason I dislike BG's is because it destroyed all the world pvp that was the main draw outside of raids.  It was a blast to be in a guild and have one of your members request help because some jerk decided to camp their body.  But more so, the constant fighting in certain areas where Horde and Alliance met for quests, made those area feel dangerous.  It made them feel alive.
---
Foothills was one of those areas, everyday there would be a battle that'd wage for hours, nothing was ever gained or lost, just who could hold the area that day and ruin the quests for the enemy.  And when you were in the area it made questing dynamic, you weren't just worried about pulling mobs.  You were worried about the war happening just over the hill.
---
Anyway, once they assigned an instance where battle happened, all of that went away over night.  PvP in the world just went away, because well the best loot for a while was to be found in the stupid instanced battlegrounds and well...
---
but also from a lore standpoint it ruined the game.
---
The entire fiction of this game world was built around the idea of Horde vs Alliance.  So much so that once you chose your side, that was your heros side.  And you could wave away instanced dungeons as just part of the design.  But the introducing of battlegrounds game-ified the entire world.  The largest conflict, the driving factor behind the world suddenly became a capture the fucking flag game, complete with prizes being handed out for whatever reason.
---
Seriously, whomever introduced battlegrounds, did not understand their own game.  I know nothing about what happened after the first expansion because, like what was the point of having chosen a PvP server, if there was fuck all PvP to do.  I wanted giant battles that I engaged in, not the 8v8 or whatever battlegrounds was.
---
Anyway I'm excited I'll get to play for at least a month or two before they reintroduce the battlegrounds and fuck it up.  But till than I'll enjoy stalking mages with my undead rogue, and enjoy baiting rogues into fights with my mages.
---
Dude don‚Äôt forget every Vanilla player also raided Naxx ;)
---
having sex while camping is fucking in-tents
---
Sounds like too much work...
---
Thanks. Except you can't prove me wrong because it's true.
---
True, I don't think blizz has put much effort into enforcing it and I'm sure people break that rule, but I'd still toe the line. Blizz didn't enforce things like model editors for a long time and people thought they were basically fine, until they did a 180 and a massive banwave hit tons of people editing.
---
Obviously lol
---
Classic WoW isn't ready
---
Chuck Norris is ready for Barrens Chat
---
I think they know but its definitely Not a high Priority Change.
---
Imagine the response to Tigole's rants if he was a player today...
---
It's hard to get clarity here.
---
By "Better Graphics" are we confirming that the Classic WoW has updated player models as an option?
---
&gt;You rock. What a wonderful post.
---
Normally that would be true but this time I was actually trying to contribute. 
---
But apparently all the children couldnt handle that.
---
It did, at least for a while. It was a hit or miss feature for people depending on their rig. But I remember it  being \*heavy\* if you turned the slider all the way up.
---
\&gt;Probably had some white garbo shield while being underleveled = rip
---
Like that white shield that drops from Kresh, for instance.
---
What do you mean if he have a chance, he've already done it..
---
:P
---
The difference in healing in vanilla, having to precast or cancel casts AMD actually watch mana, compared to retail where you pretty much need youtube or netflix on a second monitor to not fall asleep actually excites me.
---
Ok ok I get you, just hear me out though. So next time you are about to click a stream you don't want to watch, just move your mouse cursor *away*.

Thanks a lot for the in-depth reply, that was a very interesting read. A very good friend of mine is a successful goblin too, and he's operating similarly from what I've gathered in discussions with him so far. It's a very interesting way to play the game, unfortunately I never really got into the craft. Any good resources to learn?
---
Dont rogue train swords at 10?
---
For whatever reason they seem to watch people they hate, which I don't understand at all.
---
Why would you check the box for Classic Beta then? You're taking up space for someone else.
---
Totally agree, I see no reason to NOT have Tauren Priest, Human/Undead Hunters, Human/Troll Druids, remove Gnome Warriors. Ahhh, a man can dream.
---
Hi, /u/minecrafter59049
---
I have a friend who graduated high school in 2003, got hooked on WOW in 2004 and basically made it his whole life for several years. He finally got off the WOW and started college when he was about 30 and is about ready to graduate now.
---
So, yeah, it‚Äôs possible.
---
I‚Äôm almost 21 and I started playing in early BC.
---
Wow, you're totally right.  I 100% thought the boss was higher than 21.
---
Did they pretty up Vanilla? Like, are they using modern textures/polygons?
---
To number 1 - you can monetize any length video. 10 minutes is for mid-rolls.
---
There'll most likely just be addons for this if this tracking stuff is hard for them to fix, so they'll most likely not even bother. It all depends on the classic team obviously.
---
This beta is also good for the development of addons.
---
This were quite wierd to me too, but theres actually many streamers with more subs than viewers. Twitch prime ftw
---
But MUH SPEED LOOKS TOO FAST
---
You said people can‚Äôt afford cars I showed you how cheap my fleet is, proving you wrong. If you have a job you‚Äôre at least bringing $300 home every week, therefor you can afford a car
---
For fun?? They have two months to look for bugs man. Most people are reporting stuff anyway. Chance reports anything he finds, Tips is reporting literally everything he dislikes regardless of it being a bug because just "in case". Staysafe is making a list to report after his speed run.
---
Game is hard enough as it is! Maybe I just suck though.
---
banning multiboxing is a PServer thing... why would blizzard stop a player to spend more money on multiple subscriptions?
---
as long as you dont use third party programs to replicate inputs, its fine
---
No the Tauren hitbox is what I was referencing. Not making comparisons to whatever is in retail.
---
i mean, you go in under geared for the dungeon then you just ask to get bent by every mob in there
---
Huh
---
SellJunk has remarkable forwards and backwards compatibility. Downloaded one for Nost and that same version worked all the way through MoP!
---
Yea why would anyone want to share their thought's on a subject related to that subreddit. Crazy.

I mean, I was a little kid sitting on my Dad‚Äôs lap the first time I explored Dun Morogh. My age doesn‚Äôt invalidate saying I played wow.

I will be returning to raid and finish all the content I never reached, however.

---
You are not reading what I am saying. We KNOW for a fact that things were wrong in the Demo. 200% spell crit multiplier on spells were one of the many issues.
---
When we can conclusively prove that there are unblizzlike behaviour then it stands to reason there may be other unblizzlike behaviour. It would be incredibly dumb to assume that everything always work correctly.
---
A private server player who does have more recent experience can more easily spot several issues. Doesnt mean they are always right, but they DO have a rough understanding of the game which they can use to submitt bug reports and have Blizzard check it out.
---
The countless threads and posters who prompted him to make this thread, they will never come in here.
---
Then again, this is the magical enabling land of Reddit where opinions handed directly to a person somehow carry more worth. I mean, that and also, making a public call out thread is always good when you feel like you need to hear other people are also on your side. Internet hugs.
---
Yeah, but druids get a stam multiplier, and leather gear has as much stam as mail.
---
thats identical to me
---
That‚Äôs too much BFA for me to understand what that piece of gear is. Did two rogues rolls (Seven and soda) and Soda rolled lower but got the gear?
---
You first have to get inside the underwater crater of course.

isen't it one of those caster shields? Based on its apearence
---
You should go back to banning abortion.  So hawt right now.
---
Except there is, it uses 3rd party software to automate the usage of abilities on all but the primary account. That is against the TOS. They seem to not care about it but they also didnt care about TMorph, until they did.
---
&gt; Ya, the key to multiboxing is that 1 button = n actions (n being the number of accounts you are using). 
---
Not quite.
---
1 button is still 1 action, regardless of how many clients are going.
---
frontstabbing is currently in the beta. im sure itll be removed though
---
Because they are using 3rd party software to automate all the accounts other than the main one? Well see what happens, I doubt they ban people for it but they surely could if they wanted to
---
Most underrated comment
---
Yeah I think it's that people don't see the nuisances as intentional to emulate the 'role-play' in the RPG game element. Buying arrows to shoot out of my bow, which needs to go into my quiver, that takes up a bag spot, which is already getting limited from food/water/bandages/pet food, is all part of the RPG of being a hunter, as silly as it may sound.
---
Balancing changes simply change the whole game, as major or minor as you may think they are. Balancing is a constant act of buffing and nerfing, as these systems are very complex and hard to predict outcomes. Vanilla is simply in a state of balance where I think many people are happy with it. It's not perfect, but it works and it's fun. Every class has something it brings to the table, excels at one thing, and isn't the greatest at the other. There are real trade offs in vanilla.
---
Please check the thread before posting things already in the thread.
---
Sounds like me too only I‚Äôm 40.
---
Night/day cycle is a big element to the game play for me. I hope they made it as dark as it was (doubt it.)
---
1 button = 1 action on every account at the same time. Therefore 1 button could = 40 actions
---
ah shit, forgot that step. Long time since I called the Nintendo Power hotline.
---
I‚Äôm doing it on the 13th to secure my names. Small price to pay.
---
&gt;‚Äôm confused how people can claim bugs in regen, damage etc. Blizzard literally ported the 1.12 database so it contains EXACTLY the same values as the original game at that stage.
---
Because they're fucking stupid lmao. People genuinely think that private servers know more than Blizzard themselves. I'm literally cringing at Alexsensuals twitter.
---
Private servers are wrong, and Blizzard is right. It's simple unless it's blatantly obvious. No one actually has the numbers besides private server devs.. Like actual devs that coded their database, and Blizzard.
---
Do think think this subreddit has every person who has heard of private servers or consist of every player who will try classic? If ‚Äúno one ever‚Äù thought they would be 1:1 then the topic would never come up... and yet it does.
---
Why on earth does anyone care? Streamers are hyperbolic by nature because that‚Äôs what gets viewers. If you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to look past that just don‚Äôt watch their content..
---
You don't need to be tank specced, to be fair. You just need to not be a moron and put shield block on your bar. And repair your damn gear.
---
If the tank is a moron, and the healer is also acting like a moron, all the mainspec in the world won't save you.
---
I guess if you're doing a ton of instancing it would help, but personally I stuck to solo grinding or group quests if it was a difficult mob or great reward. 
---
Blood craze starts to help you right away at level 20-22.  Enrage is also a big help at 25-29, then death wish can basically be used on cooldown to really pimp out your damage.  Flurry isn't AS good without great gear but is definitely a bonus from levels 35-39 as well. 
---
If you put the first 11 points in prot, it delays all those bonuses by 10 levels.  I just can't endorse it, I'd rather be as strong as possible as early as possible for what I prefer to do- solo grinding.  I think with effective play you can still tank fine as fury while leveling but ofc Prot would help you be a more effective tank.  I suppose if you're going to do every instance 2 or 3 times and/or maximize your rested XP then it could be more effective.  
---
You could also get a healer friend and 3-man instances just to grind the elites for XP but that would be slow =P  Probably better off finding dense normal mobs in the world and going nuts that way.
---
See I just don't get these Vanilla only people. What in TBC did you lose the heroes journey? Or Wrath? Sure TBC added flying but thats because they literally used flying to gate people out of content (which they dont do anymore, the flying part). Wrath added LFD which wasn't super bad. Everyone seems to not remember that doing dungeons used to take hours, part of that was getting the group and then traveling. I remember several times people wouldn't join without a lock or as soon as 4/5 people got their the last person was like oops, gotta go. If you were lucky enough to make it in god forbid you died, I remember doing the arena in BRD (which is probably the most fun dungeon fight in Vanilla), if you wiped it sucked going back, finding your way through and not getting lost, then once you got back half the mobs had respawned. Some people just up and quit. Welp, time to go back to town and find some more adventurers! In a world where you have hours of time (I was like 12 or something, i had plenty after homework). All I can say now is it'll be easier cuz I have discord/rl friends to do this with rather than random strangers (although some of these discord friends are from WoW back in Cata).
---
Ah 1 action per character, thanks. I don't have a problem with multi boxing on principle, maybe on PvP realms but PvE I don't care at all.
---
The edges are polished yeah they released a video on it. It's hard for me to notice though
---
Sounds like you might get to view this game from a fresh set of eyes then! I bet many people would pay to have this new experience all over again.
---
I‚Äôve had 3/4 streams up at a time and most people are reporting stuff. Can‚Äôt deal with Asmon right now with his constant motivation speech stuff about classic haha
---
Depends on if you enjoy leveling or not. If you don‚Äôt then I would just watch guides/streams and videos instead. Less of an investment. 
---
I am enjoying leveling to practice with a particular class to see if it‚Äôs one I want to power out to raid with.
---
The best part is the people who complained about it before and got weather effects removed are not going to be playing Classic this time
---
The DPS warrior didn't switch to 1 hand and a shield and taunt the boss especially after the rogue's evasion was over. I don't know what kind of person rolls a warrior and doesn't immediately do that when that situation happens.
---
Some might say that is overkill
---
Oh I know. I'd invite everyone in the area and normally have 3-4 people going for that carcass
---
You have never once had to guess at what I was saying, my communication is clear. The receiving end of the communication is not a factor that can be controlled on open sources and will have a variety of reactions. My communication will be very effective to some and others will go "hurr durr your wrong cause my daddy works at blizzard" so have at. I have not once been disproved.
---
No. 
---
I said there are people in your country who work two jobs and still can't. 
---
Do you not understand English so poorly you don't know that does not mean ALL people? Or are you just so fired up and angry you can't think straight?
---
I remember the moonwalker.
---
When did the change occur?
---
Well, good thing it‚Äôs too late to be implemented now.
---
I am with you. I still play the game and I barely remember anything about my time in Vanilla/TBC especially the higher end dungeons in vanilla. I think that will make it more fun. Relearning things and almost seeing it through fresh eyes.
---
1 button = 1 action (40 times) is still 1:1
---
As do platitudes suit you, mon'amie.
---
Only you know how quickly you get burned out.
---
&gt;The reason I dislike BG's is because it destroyed all the world pvp that was the main draw outside of raids.
---
I think that varied on the server pop and type though. My experience was much different. I was Detheroc-Horde back then and World PVP was very common after BGs came out. I personally loved that addition to the game. Different strokes I guess.
---
They seem to be pissy about everything.
---
Nope.
---
then the question comes, do they do them at the right timers? That is something nost confessed they had no clue about since its not in the pserver emulation sourse code.   
---
So while they have all the abilities and use em, its more or less a guessing game.
---
Some quests did give you rep with everything and some gave rep with specific races.
---
TBC killed Azeroth.    
---
No forced migration a to TBC. (I hated it in 2006)
---
Finish Vanilla content please.
---
Yep, not cheap but waaaaay better than a standard one
---
Client side only? Sure.
---
Im extremely aware of my tone and my word choice. The counter argument is silly and wrong, with minimal research that is provable. People that make statements and spread misinformation deserve to be spoken down to.
---
Really? I don't recall ever noticing it in Retail and I've played Legion and BfA.
---
soda is better than this now. he is one of the only ones that does not beg and hype for twitch subs.
---
Exactly, literally no one knows. I hope a blizzard community manager will address some of these things to clarify for people.
---
In college now at 43. Life Happens

"plenty of time" 3 seconds  from first hit and killed him from 55%\~ with an unknown amount of overkill. Not sure sodas heals couldve saved him there in those 3 seconds

---
I think the point was more that there are many people who don't follow the "College immediately out of high school, Master's immediately after Bachelor's" path.
---
Or the ogres that when interrupted immediately starts casting the next spell in its line up even though that was not how they worked in vanilla
---
inb4 ''no changes''
---
Transmog defeats the purpose of identifying someone of class, level range, spec and achievement. 
---
If you're going to want to look good.... Just use the tier set that you're going to be in for ages. you're going to transmog to Judgement anyway.
---
o yeah, then tell me how do you see if the enemy is green fodder or a main priority target? 
---
how do you make any kind of pug party/raid without having to inspect every single person?
---
go back to retail pls
---
He's just childish. Everyone grows up.
---
Multiboxing in classic... :D goods luck and thanks for the ez honor
---
In theory, it's a good troll attempt, but the legions of trolls before you spamming this subreddit with the same fucking questions a million times a day justify deducting trolling points, so I'll go with 4/10
---
&gt;as long as you dont use third party programs to replicate inputs
---
Yeah, that's why it's sort of legitimate to rag on him. Like, the healer was bad, but they were probably new to the game. Newbie's gonna noob, that's fine. Tips has little excuse.
---
He says he did at least.
---
Ya it is nice to see I went and watched his stream and followed him.
---
Option two is do the grind twice.
---
I think it was 7th grade for me and I‚Äôll be a doctor next year!
---
A simplified answer is the engine is going be using certain values or "weights" to determine things like regen rates. The values that were in the 1.12 database are correct, but the weights and calculations made with those weights and the database values could be wrong since the engine is different.
---
The WoW engine has changed A LOT, even all the way to it's foundation and things like vanilla and some of the ways it "feels" can even be part of bugs with the engine that used to use that were never intended but also may not have been caught. So just because values were ported, things are very likely not going to work as they used to without tweaking.
---
One server is going to have an Angwe type guy and it will be hell here
---
The same meaningless trash thats in the vanilla you want so badly. Yeah. Not everything about WoW is raiding. Sure its probably the most fun part (except for people who enjoy PVP). But yeah I guess professions are meaningless in Vanilla, don't tell that to your hopefully competant raiders who want you to bring pots/resis items/trinkets/etcotheruselessitems.
---
It can be hard if you dont have good strategy.
---
I'm sure Alexensual is bitching about this somewhere.
---
Damn those terrible over powerd murloc quests
---
No I think the UI slider only increases the size of the UI on the screen. Check the link to see what the difference is.
---
Do any of them have jobs or other IRL responsibilities? Do they actually get paid to stream... like enough for rent and shit?
---
I seriously hope to god they go the OSRS route and have a separate dev team that designs content based off the tenets of vanilla
---
Next time please split this into two paragraphs. I have trouble reading a wall of text. Used to have to use a playing card to keep the lines right lol.
---
To be clear I like TBC but, hate WOTLK. TBC still has many of the elements I love. I just despise flyers. If they redid that expac but, remolded it to not have flying. It would be my favorite. The blow to world pvp was just too much for me though.
---
This is the consequence of the "No Changes" crowd having so much influence. Clearly good QoL changes are dumpstered :&lt;
---
&gt;Hehe, not trying to defend anyone here, but I'd blame soda for that one too.
---
No need to explain yourself lol, I don't mind a good back and forth as long as it remains civil. That said, thanks for giving me more background on this, as I said I didn't watch the whole video so I didn't know Soda told him to "just go", so it sounds like they were both way out of their element as far as game play goes in the sense of they're both inexperienced when it comes to vanilla/classic, which honestly just further reinforces my opinion on tips.

34 here, my body is ready for PVP.
---
Only reason I played the game to begin with, can't wait to gank lowbies /spit and wait for the guildies to come and start a war. Can't wait to be the captain of the boats going from continent to continent and killing other factions on sight so they can't transport themselves.
---
I wanna come home.

I believe they misread the part where Blizzard mentioned the 2 day stress tests happening on a few dates.
---
Click the link in the class avatar image at the top to find out. Should be multiple alternative items there.
---
on a casual standpoint, if you don't know how to open the wtf file, you are basicly fucked. I honestly think those are the things that have kept most players away from private servers over the years. Its piss easy to do but the majority of people are goddamn crippled when it comes to basic PC knowledge.
---
No, but if you have the gold on a higher level character it can be automatically deducted.
---
Is it because US actual economy is so weak compared to EU or why is it always at like 50-60% of EU prices
---
The cost of respec was a DESIGN PHILOSOPHY of "individual identity".  
---
You choose a spec, and roll that.    
---
The constant respec is a thing because of Min/Maxing
---
Holy crap. "Stone" is actually a measurement?
---
Is that confirmed?
---
I'm happy to admit I did the leveling in 2005, took me about 8 months of leveling on slow but steady (once I could solo Dead mines at like level 42 that's the only thing I did for weeks üòÇ) but did a bit of pvping back in the end of 2006.
---
( \* ) Show characters in their actual gear.
---
(¬†   )  Show characters in their tmog gear.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to that setting.  Classic is about having fun with an old game.  If it's fun for you to play dress up, but I can view you in your actual gear, sure, whatever.
---
Hmm...I seem to recall them during into question marks, but I might just be making that up :\  I'll try to find a video
---
Oh look the same question asked for the 10th time today.
---
They have already stated they they would consider JUST DOING Vanilla.
---
Please stop trying to make OSRS a thing with Vanilla WoW because it will never happen.
---
Never.
---
#NOCHANGESREEEEE :)
---
But you're referencing foliage, water, shadows - etc? I don't think there are updated character models.
---
No one can has my mini diablo anymore.
---
1 US dollar is .78 Pounds, I couldn't tell you much about wow token prices between the two regions though
---
Oh man, this guys gunning for record downvotes.
---
How is it pathetic? You sound mental
---
OG here, those that raided naxx were pretty limited at least on my server.  Don't believe the lies!
---
The streamers don't seem to give a fuck about bugs or content testing, it seems to be more about getting "world first" and rushing through the content for the... bragging rights (lol)?
---
Pat themselves on the back, give themselves a bonus and start working on TBC. "Blizzard" was the one that greenlighted classic, they don't hope it fails. If improvements need to be made to retail then they will do it. Classic is a data point, not a referendum.
---
This is probably the best compromise.
---
I mean, ill be using some vacation up after release im sure :P
---
How long do you have to play per night? Lets say you play on average 3 hours per night, rounded down to 20 hours a week. It's going to take you about two months to level up to 60 in the first place. I'm sure after that you need to dungeons if you can't get carried for another two months.
---
Damn so your personality really is as shitty as you are stupid. Crazy how trashy this community is.
---
The barrens chat guy honestly whined about the fact that you can order your characters in the character screen.
---
If people can whine about that, they will complain about actually fucking everything
---
Which is a server gold sink, which is very needed and possibly even more so with layering .
---
Settle down Beavis
---
There are no consequences to the no change crowd... There are however ramifications from those coming in and wanting classic to be tailored to how they want it to play, and not the way it WAS played.  
---
Classic was perfectly imperfect. Sure some will care if this spec is good or bad, but play what you want to spec how you want to. Enjoy the game cause there are damn sure 60 levels of it.
---
Right. That's probably correct, then. My account is still a US account. Never bothered setting up a new one, because I've never had a problem subbing or adding time to that original account.
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard didn't realize that some people wanted to do both PvP and PvE, and that talents are far from balanced that way.
---
Soda is the only one i could manage to sit through, he did a lot of his stream with Guzu. Most of the other guys are fake elitist personas, squirting over twitch prime subs and talking garbage. idk if its just me, everything i find cringe about other streams i don't get from his.
---
I know people complained about how dark nights were but they complained about the weather as well?? What plebs. The weather effects were so comfy!!
---
Yeah. Theres alot of things that are wrong on private servers, like spell casting. And alot of the time, it's both harder and easier, as with many mechanics. People try to paint it in too broad of a picture, as "private server easy mode, classic hardmode".
---
But, for example, private servers are easier when the mob doesn't have the spell in it's profile, and won't cast it. But theyre harder when they use every ability on cooldown.
---
I remember in Silverpine, fighting a dalaran sorcerer on my warrior. I think it killed me without breaking a sweat. It would frost nova me, run away, frost bolt me 2 times, and 8 seconds after the first nova, it would nova me again. Thats not right, or working as intended.
---
you definitely don't need tank/heal specs for dungeons, just have to use brain
---
Hah i worked for a number of years abroad, now in uni. Looking forward to having to explain that a bunch i guess
---
Honestly, while I might get caught up with ‚Äúrose colored goggles about some things‚Äù this is not one of them. The one thing about Vanilla-WotLK that I miss is ‚ÄúHard dungeons‚Äù or actually having to pay attention. The thing that makes me ‚Äúun sub‚Äù is when I do dungeons we just roll through them like a ball of death. Mythics are okay, but not the same. I liked the ideas of ‚Äúsapping‚Äù or ‚Äúice trap‚Äù or being creative if you didn‚Äôt have a specific DPS (warlock kite anyone?). 
---
Of all the things I miss, it‚Äôs this.
---
He always says he did play in vanilla. But often times people say he didn't and there is proof of that. 
---
Is there actually proof one way or another?
---
What a non-issue to complain about.
---
You want to make it, a toggleable setting, default to the other setting, of which you can freely choose yourself, because reasons?
---
Dude, just toggle it yourself. What a weird hill to die on.
---
 Ah they‚Äôre gonna use letters this time.......
---
That cracks me up too. I graduated high school in 2013. In 2005 I was 10. I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgreat‚Äù at video games at 10. I got to level 40ish and it took me 2 years. I‚Äôd consider myself a kid still.
---
All those juicy swifty muscles
---
If wow paladin's are just priests in armor, why aren't there nelf pallies?
---
I like that it's not a thing. It wouldn't stop me from playing -- so I guess in that sense, I am "okay" with it -- but I like the idea of knowing what people have on. Helps a lot with world pvp but it also give more "value" to items... you know their look and name and that matters. Something missing from retail.

Woa the roast game of mr ''LOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL'' is strong. In hindsight, i should have expected no less of a reaction - lol.
---
I‚Äôm 23 thank God I made the cut
---
Yup pretty much. This is why classes like combat rogue or frost mage are nice, no need to always respec.
---
Close, he was missing ~40 hp from full. It wouldn't have saved him from being two shot though as he only had 560HP, total, and received 600 dmg.
---
It wont be. People who swap over to BC will likely be playing less on Vanilla anyways. Holding people "hostage" as subs in the game, when the other option is what they prefer, is HOW you make a community more toxic. 
---
There will always be dwindling populations, over time. Merges are inevitable in the long run, you don't think were going to have 3m people playing Classic in 2040, do you?
---
Thats Tips for you. Make sure his persona dies.
---
"Balanced".    
---
Some good some bad. That's balance.    
---
All good is not balance. :/
---
I've made this sort of mistake on entities outside of World of Warcraft as well.
---
Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head but it definitely is an "Oh shit." moment.
---
But thats the thing. Smites and corpse are also not even on the leveling guide.  None of these are.
---
What i am wondering is do the guides consider your damage output..
---
8 down votes  
---
Looks like the pserver community is still butthurt of critic and general knowledge lol
---
Looks like it happened in 4.2.
---
There wasn't any value in it beyond further trying to pigeon hole hybrids into healing, exactly the issue the OP is having.
---
I think it'll come back to you once you get into the game. It's like riding a bike. You haven't used a bicycle in 10 years? You still got it once you hop on.
---
When people are popular it‚Äôs a natural response for some insecure individuals to hate.
---
yep, stopping the murder of babies is hawt right now. Hoes mad
---
Just tech support, its a pretty nice gig.
---
we already know what its future is. its called burning crusade and lich king. it doesnt matter how the game is a year from now because the purpose of it is to have vanilla forever, so anyone can play vanilla whenever they want. if they add stuff to it that wasnt originally in the game, its not the same vanilla anymore
---
True, that is what we have grown to call these larger cost items, but they did not have that title when classic was first released. We did not call things gold sinks, because we had not yet reached the point where we had dumped gold into so many of these gold sinks that we didn't think of them as their individual specific things, paying for a respect, flying, mounts, we lump them all into the generic term gold sink because we had grown a little bit tired of it and it felt a little bit like more work and less fun. But that's what overtime burnout does.
---
It's why I make a concerted effort not to refer to anything in classic as a gold sink because I choose not to think of it that way. It's not, oh gosh I have to put all this gold into this gold sink. It's, I choose to spend my gold here and this thing has value to me and I want to get it. Maybe it's a minor separation but there it is.
---
I have noticed that when folks are looting some boe green items the stats are displayed with a &lt;random enchantment&gt; affix in the tooltip underneath, while looting. Once they loot, this is gone and no extra stats are affixed to the items.
---
Sweet Christmas you guys need to relax. If this were a group of randoms in the released version of the game it would be one thing but holy hell this is a group of friends playing a beta...
---
Blizz literally said Tuesday they are considering new content for Classic WoW.

Honestly, I'm not. People give him shit for the wrong reasons sometimes. You don't have to like the guy, but the amount of "10 minute video, ree" comments were unreal. Like, shit, fuck the guy for trying to make a living.

Unfortunately because of a ‚Äúbug‚Äù / design oversight, the Holy damage from SoR unintentionally counts as a second white weapon swing, which gives SoR a 200% extra chance to procc effects, compared to SotC's 40% extra chance.
---
This bug existed in 1.12 is why SotC isn't even worth purchasing as a spell for Paladins.
---
The fact that even the class designer says it wasn't intended makes me wish they'd fix it.
---
When I tuned in last night, it looked like he'd spent a ton of silver buying 2 stacks of Water from a vendor and was drinking between mobs.. he could be life tapping for mana and just bandaging back up to keep going. He is at a very low risk of getting ganked..
---
He had his Voidwalker on Defensive and wasn't sending it in to aggro mobs at a distance.. so the mob would run up to him, hit him, then the VW aggros.. hes losing damage and taking unnecessary damage. Very poor pet management.
---
I played a Warlock from Vanilla through the end of BC and what I saw was not reminiscent of someone that played a lot of Lock back in the day.. but the class was radically different when you raided SM/Ruin or Pet Sac BC  specs compared to Modern WOW where I dont even know if Mana is a thing.
---
It‚Äôs fascinating interacting with cultists.
---
Some people may, but it is definitely not the usual for that to happen.
---
If people need something, they‚Äôll need on it.  Otherwise they will roll greed
---
Can we at least put some effort into bashing people if that's what we're doing? 
---
It doesn't matter whether you're a veteran or not, the large majority of people will get lost in dungeons, outside of dungeons, in the major cities. I have never in my life found my way into the correct mara instance.
---
Damn I need this kinda list for my Holy priest
---
Ying Yang. Light dark. Good bad.   
---
All of human history and enlightenment understands this concept.    
---
All good. All Perfect. This is not balance.
---
I would be more than OK if instead of making burning crusade they some how distance and make a separate story line, like an alternate universe where it can be expanded to get different expansions that can be built and modeled around vanilla gameplay.
---
It wasn't a server gold sink though as only specific class/specs were in the position of needing to respec frequently.  Now if every class was in the same situation in regards to spec it might have been a realistic gold sink.
---
Probably right before combat
---
I'm sure they all went back, though, and killed that boss the next try. Or if they didn't, they could have. It just took a fully ready group, with a healer ready to drop CHUNKS of healing. Thats also a kind of boss where health pots for the tank and mana pots for the healer are helpful.

Asmongold was afk

Paladin rez = FULL HP rez?  [https://clips.twitch.tv/FineAmericanLionDxAbomb](https://clips.twitch.tv/FineAmericanLionDxAbomb)
---
That's what I think aswell. I would be all up for new lore too.
---
&gt; World PVP was very common after BGs came out.
---
I can't remember the names of the servers but at launch all the large guilds chose which servers they'd be battling on.  When game launch the first two were completely slammed so many of the big guilds settled on a 3rd, which was the 2nd or 3rd most popular server after all of it settled down.  That's the server I played on with Goon Squad.
---
So sure there was different experiences, but to say World PvP didn't die off by like 90% is not remembering or maybe you played on a small server with not many guilds competing against each other for whose the best bragging status. 
---
 Foothills battles ended as soon as loot was introduced.  I'm not talking about when there was beta testing the battlegrounds, I'm talking about the weeks after when the bg rank loot grind commenced officially.
---
I don't know how you can like the giant battles becoming capture the flag instances, I don't understand how anyone could of loved that.  It was so lame.  Sorry not to harp on this, but like, those instances are what ruined the game for me.
---
love it.
---
vanilla/classic may not be harder, but it will punish you for being stupid
---
That's why it's sort of subjective.  I mean fury gives you that sweet increase to cleave damage which allows you to pull more than one mob at a time, but arms also has it's perks.  You can't really go wrong tbh.
---
Had a M+ run in Legion ruined by a Warlock not dismissing his pet. Was kind of tickled to see that a decade later it was still something to be aware of.
---
I would be ok with the CUSTOM dungeon listings like you use for mythics, or at least did in legion. Not sure about BFA. Randomly placing you?? Nahhhh
---
The value in a Respec cost is subjective, it's different from person to person. And I guarantee nobody looked at high Respec cost in the way you just said back in 2005.
---
You play as whatever spect you want to play and if the guild you are with does not want to use your spec in a raid, you can look for another guild. Or you can make a guild. When is, not everybody will be able to conveniently block out of their minds the fact that instant respec's exist in retail and for them somehow make this high cost gold sink of respecting feel pointless or just busy work. It's the way classic always was. And the way people found value in that 15 years ago keep naturally because they didn't know any better. It's up to you if you can choose to think that way again.
---
Well, you didn't know much during Vanilla though right?
---
Any new content needs to go to separate servers with the option to copy characters over.  The whole point is to not over write the old stuff.
---
NOCHANGESREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I am with you on this. The game is supposed to be fun. Bring on the meme specs!
---
Triggered enough to reply to every comment lol. Obviously feeling embarrassed bro. It hides it better when you just skull away üëå
---
&gt;naming conventions
---
There is an old school naming policy, which I am sure is a shade of grey from being the same thing as a 'naming convention'.  
---
Introducing someone to RP? Seriously? My truncated response is that WoW is a horrible platform to start someone on RP. But since RP is just making shit up to say anyway, then it won't matter much. I do suggest something a little rudimentary for an introduction to RP, like Dungeons and Dragons. (shoutout to my gaming group, shout out to the hobbitweed smoking half-orc barb)
---
People don't simply stumble into RP in WoW with little exception. The exception is when it makes for a good excuse to cybersex. Make sure all those 13 year olds going through puberty attend your naming convention. 
---
I have zero sympathy for any nerd who rolls on any RPPVP server. They are so horribly bad that they are being systematically being removed from the game.
---
except the entire reason vanilla is being made is to keep it as a sort of "museum artifact" where you can go and see it as it was anytime you want. adding or changing things changes it from being a replica, to a remake, and we didnt ask for a remake we asked for a replica. and weve asked for that for a VERY long time
---
"You think there will be 3m, but there wont".    
---
Where have I heard that again?
---
That's what they said about OSRS aswell yet here we are.
---
That is wrong. Please actually post correct quotes in regards to that.
---
TBC would be next.
---
Wouldn't be too certain about the jumping since we'll be getting the retail version of how terrain works. No wall-jumping for instance.
---
Two of the people I know that played Classic WoW back when they were in 4th grade are in Grad School atm, so it legit works. I'd be in the same boat, but I was a later addition.
---
LOL HOW MANY PLAYER U HAVE IN EACH LAYER?
---
I love it
---
Theres actually a psychological reason that businesses like McDonalds and Coke advertise. If you see enough background bullshit adds, it's more likely to be the first thing you think of when you get that initial craving for a flattened burger or some soda. It won't actually teach somebody of their existence, since it's common knowledge, but it encourages that subconscious initial connection.
---
But WoW is a different story. Shit man, theres probably people *playing WoW* that don't know Classic is coming out.

---
Balance is being able to do both PvP and PvE without screwing yourself over. Being able to only do 1 thing is not balance. Also this is a video game, not some philosophical religion or whatever.
---
Paladins using rank 1 Redemption ress the target with full hp. It should only ress you with 65 health at that rank.
---
Example: https://clips.twitch.tv/CredulousAmazingAyeayeUWot
---
That he lost the roll on..
---
But they dont. This is based on the 7.3.5 client.
---
Never heard of the guy until yesterday. I had his stream on in the background at work so I could know when beta was up. I thought he was a jackass when he was heavily teasing a July release date, or potentially even earlier. He knew the release date (as he had a picture of it once he was able to announce it). Kind of a dick move getting people excited for a July release date when he knew damn well it would be the end of August.
---
And then, 15 years down the line, they will announce Classical Classic WoW, for the people who still want to play the original game without any of the extra shit they come up with. :-(
---
Joana should have at least got a key, one of the only ones this sub agrees would actually contribute.
---
Regen rates end at level 15 I believe. I think that feature has always been in wow.
---
If you‚Äôre an adult who lives alone you should probably be working at least a $12/h job, minimum wage is for high schoolers
---
Discussion of wrong opinions is strictly forbidden by the elitist assholes who patrol this subreddit. Prepare for downvotes
---
Fucking christ 7% lol, gg
---
Well the requirements will probably be pretty much the same as retail which are really pretty low.  As for download size I guess now that the beta is out we should have a pretty good idea how big it'll be.
---
BTW why go to class at all if you're just going to play WoW.
---
If you don't think asmon played classic you don't know enough about him to talk shit...
---
Exactly, these live chat reps are just interpreting the language as we all are
---
People just rightfully hate the super obnoxious ones like asamafuck, tipsouch, or estafart.  They are toxic for the community putting down other players and acting self centered.  Watching them play the beta they would curse and insult other players.   I couldn't help but cringed when I heard asamawhatever his name his go on a swear laced rant against casuals last night, don't these guys realize kids watch their streams?
---
LOL i know right
---
I'd be okay with the Barbershop. It's such a minor thing that will only affect yourself that it seems fine. Also I'd honestly prefer an option to enable AOE-Looting.
---
Haha solid.  As long as you know what a toxic fucker you are, I'm satisfied
---
Yeah I weirdly still remember real arguments I had with those people. It was the same logic behind why dark nights were removed. Stuff like this is why blizz had the ‚Äúcaters to the vocal minority‚Äù reputation from early on.
---
You throw around the term 'beta or not'....but come on dude... he is in a group of friends...on a beta.  Seriously now.
---
News 404?
---
Defensive stance should make it attack whenever you cast. Aggressive back then made them literally attack everything around you.
---
triggered? where is the rage posting? And yes, I always respond to responses. I have to ask myself, why are you making it personal? You could have A. ignored my post B. simply downvoted my post but you went with C. snarky personal attacks. Yet you say I am the triggered one, interesting how people always project
---
Fuck off, lol.
---
Some people have reported that they got into the Beta without a subscription. The Beta profile checkbox for WoW Classic beta were only introduced on Tuesday morning as far as I know.
---
Lol. If you say so.
---
In an RPG being able to do everything is just stupid.   
---
Classic was designed with DnD style RPG.   
---
Your choices have consequences.   
---
Why is this so hard to understand?    
---
(Everyone gets a trophy generation)
---
There really is a lot of inherent vitriol here.
---
Extremely not healthy.
---
The engine is modern with some optional improvements (shadows, water, ground clutter distance mainly).
---
The art assets (models, textures, animations, effects, etc.) is Vanilla.
---
I know, tell me about your time as a Democrat.
---
Ahh 2004, the first year of high school for me and the year my family finally upgraded from Dial-Up to a DSL connection. Far too many nights that I should have been studying instead devoted to leveling my Human Rogue (or trying to actually make it through the queue to get into Stormrage server...).
---
You hated World PVP or you miss the ability to gank? If you killed someone, they should have been able to move on with their lives and do something else, not sit there and be camped for an hour.  
---
World PVP was fun, go and raid the horde or alliance starting area in Hellfire Penisula. They also had anti flying mobs so you had to get a bit further away before flying away.
---
I mean it was confirmed on the release information...
---
It's so people who aren't familiar with the classic game and want to learn will watch and think they can rely on his opinions and ideas. He's trying to turn a dollar by acting like a reliable source of info and generate those clicks.
---
lol classic is as hardcore as you make it. someone can play 5hrs a week and still be better than someone who puts in 50+ hrs a week. have you tried any games that are labeled as difficult recently? games have gotten way more challenging dont kid yourself. btw i hate fortnite nut thats besides the point
---
Back in 05 it wasn't unusual for /played from 1-60 to be 19+ days played, at least, in my experience. 
---
I even remember we had a guy (who I hated because I was an immature little shit) quit the Horde, re-rolled alliance and get invited into a relatively decent guild because he was able to get to 60 in 18 days /played (at least, that's what I was told). 
---
Moral of the story, leveling was a time consuming aspect of the game, but that's awesome because that's how adventures happen and it allows you to meet some awesome people along the way.
---
Are you tall, skinny, bald, and goofy looking?
---
I guess you can‚Äôt have a sense of humor to play a video game, especially with friends
---
Soda died like 10 times in the few hours I had his stream on in the background. Stay safe as well. They were both just solo leveling. I think people underestimate how much harder it will be in certain areas with proper scripting (actual pats and groups that chain) and mob hp/damage/armor values increased from pservers
---
It's exactly as it was in Vanilla. (You can check on pservers.)
---
&gt; 1 button = 1 action on every account at the same time. Therefore 1 button could = 40 actions
---
Replicating keystrokes has always been allowed, and it isn't a secret that multiboxers do this.  Blizzard is well aware of how multiboxing works, and key replication does not somehow twist the "rule" that you are repeating.
---
Likewise, you can already perform more than one "action" in a single key press through use of the in-game macro system, so the "1 button = 1 action" statement holds very little weight, and, unfortunately, keeps getting thrown around by random players as if it's gospel.
---
Tips is just proving what most people believed anyway.
---
He never played during Vanilla no matter how often he says that he did.
---
Also the whole cloak thing? Not cool.
---
Joke's on you. The reason they have even started with Classic WoW are the huge amounts of people who played on private servers for over a decade, not needing new content after a period of time. So please get out of here and play retail, if you want new stuff and not the old game and nothing but the old game.
---
time-wise
---
&gt; dying to a boss and then reporting the boss for doing too much damage
---
He seriously did that? Or are you trolling?
---
If true, I hope blizz learn fast to just ignore his feedback.
---
What weird straw man are you making?
---
Dude your reply was personally attacking the OP lol. Did you bang your head today?
---
This, this is what i want to see in a beta test
---
So "off-heal" is a contraction of the phrase "off-spec-healing".
---
Well thankfully it's not like there will be any "firsts" for fights. That's already been done, 15 years ago...
---
Greetings and welcome to the WoW Classic Beta Test!
---
Below is a list of known issues for the initial WoW Classic Beta release. Please note that this list is not a complete depiction of what we‚Äôre aware of, but a sampling of issues we believe players may encounter with some regularity. We‚Äôll try to keep this updated with trending issues when possible.
---
Classes and Combat:
---
Activating Raptor Strike while Auto Shot is toggled on does not cause the hunter to begin to Auto Attack in melee
---
Hunter pets do not auto-cast Dash or Dive when engaging their targets
---
Hunter pets may not immediately return to your side upon entering passive mode
---
Many talents are currently missing their requirements text
---
User Interface:
---
Attempting to sign into twitter through the interface option crashes the client
---
World map path indicators during transport loading screens may be inaccurate
---
Items with randomly generated stats will display the &lt;Random Enchantment&gt; tag in the loot window and chat tooltips when being looted
---
Creatures and NPCs:
---
Some creatures in the game world are missing textures
---
Environments:
---
There is a strip of missing water in the Mosshide Fen area of the Wetlands
---
Dungeons:
---
There is no water present in the Ironclad Cove area of the Deadmines dungeon
---
If you find any other bugs in-game, we‚Äôd like to encourage you to use the in-game bug reporter to send those bug reports off to us before posting bug reports on these forums. For more information about the in-game bug reporter, please see this post:

PTR Bug Report Update¬†21
---
Thank you for playing the WoW Classic Beta!
---
yeah i was 8 yo when i played vanilla and i was homeschooled. i played 12 hours a day. i was bad but still better than a lot of people considering i was a literal child
---
At 2:36, like 5 seconds after your timestamp, a night elf charges the tauren, who should have that massive hitbox. And sure, it's not 2 tauren, its a night elf and tauren. But theyre like 4 yards away from the model of the tauren. There may be other factors, but I think u/xypez footage is WAY off from that.
---
It's a hate bandwagon and downright deranged. People are losing their minds raging over streamers they could just refrain from watching.
---
works as intended
---
You know beta selects are a lot more systematic than that, right? It is probably a very complex algorithm that takes into account your region, play history, computer specs, subscription habits, your age and gender and race, etc etc etc... and then they want a good cross-section of all that.
---
Lifetap doesn't stop regular spirit based mana regen so that is wrong.
---
Gotta love that fucking amazing S P E L L B A T C H I N G on that last Healing Touch to Guzu.
---
16ppl in barrens an hour ago. Probably Not too late.
---
Not just the manchildren but the womenchildren and the childrenchildren too.
---
Your username is literally ripped off from 'The Newsroom'; your psuedo intellectual facade is showing. Moreover, you could only be bothered to respond with an oh so catchy quip rather than address the actual points. Well done, I am impressed.
---
Feigning internet outrage is addictive.
---
This might be a modern client feature, like wall jumping, that's glued to the modern game.
---
That's the best thing about this thread; it's not entirely obvious whether some replies are jokes or not.
---
class balancing completely changes vanilla, hunter pets requiring food is one of those old RPG elements that you dont see anywhere else and is part of why people like vanilla so much more then modern wow, and summoning stones and new reagent bags are QoL changes which is another reason why people like vanilla, because it doesnt have all of the QoL things that led to wow becoming what it is today. theres no reason to make any changes to the game because we like it as it is and for what it was, just leave it be
---
This convo makes me wet
---
Theyre not interperting anything.
---
http://imgur.com/a/zUSJBEM
---
It's literally posted information.
---
PvE and PvP in general = "everything?"
---
Quit your straw men.
---
Guys. It's based on a lot of things. They want a broad range of player-types testing. How is this hard to understand?
---
So if a lot of people used it but not all it‚Äôs not a good sink? Does that mean arrows are not a good sink because it‚Äôs only for people with a bow? Or certain mats like dyes don‚Äôt count because every on isn‚Äôt a bs or tailor?
---
Given the linear flow of time it's kind of the exact audience haha
---
People are all worked up over the beta, may be a little bit before actual discussion can happen here in any capcity again
---
And the reason for that was flying. 
---
Weather effects only went up so high.
---
Hello?!
---
I‚Äôm a socialist, actually.  
---
And before you ask where I‚Äôm gunna get the money for all the ‚Äúfree‚Äù stuff for all the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù bums (handouts)...the answer is simple.  Taxes.  Lots and lots and loooooooots of taxes.  I‚Äôd vote for a law that literally took half of your money and gave it to undocumented refugee families to help em out.  After all, America is the ‚Äúbeacon on the hill‚Äù so ‚Äúsend us your poor.‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs the American way.
---
I was making fun of the OP, not "attacking" and hence we come to your problem in life.
---
This is lit, but sad that Benediction is not animated :(
---
the reason vanilla is being created is to restore vanilla as a sort of "museum relic" so you can go back and see it as it was at any time you want to, changing stuff makes it not as special. imagine going to the museum and seeing someone repainted the mona lisa cuz they thought it looked better that way. people would be pretty pissed right?
---
Honestly I think the range in the video is accurate.  IIRC normal melee range is 5 yards while tauren was 7 which is quite a difference.  It gets goofy when you bring two tauren into the mix.
---
Oh yeah, but are you planning on paying 2 subs just to get a level 5 bank alt faster?
---
Not to mention you'll have to pay this sub forever or you'll lose access to your bank alt.
---
Lol i know such bad coordination and theyre all on discord.... these baby boys are in for a treat.
---
Tips is a tool
---
Any computer built within the last 10 years can run wow no problem
---
&gt; In the total absence of any compelling evidence, I believe it's more likely that the company rebuilding their own game got it right.
---
I would agree with you if it wasn't for the fact that they already got a ton of shit wrong, which is expected, really. I don't have anything against Blizzard for getting it wrong, I just don't understand why people behave like dumbass fanboys when someone brings even a linger of doubt over a mechanic, there's no need to be so defensive.Not talking about you by the way, just most people in this subreddit in general.
---
&gt; "I'm right, I won't put in effort to prove it but just you watch someone will eventually do it for me."
---
Well yeah, that's a stance that I can take for now, either I will get proven wrong or right in the next few days, I don't really care which, I just want to have an authentic experience, and all I'm trying to do is bring attention to something that I believe isn't authentic, I honestly don't get why that's bad.
---
What a twist!
---
Special drops like those will (or should) be mentioned in the rules. Obviously you should never join a guild that does loot council and doesn't post very specific rules on how they are managing it (tank gets gear priority for example). It's not perfect, but no system is and DKP still has tons of problems. It's very easy to cheese other guildies out of gear and sometimes it can be difficult to prove someone is doing it.
---
He's an adult and knows its a shitty thing to do
---
has there been any comment about classic gold being tradable for game time since its the same account? and if so, I wonder what the conversion rate is for classic gold to retail gold.
---
This could be a series and/or a movie.
---
Devolopers have said layering should not be necessary after the first month.
---
The beta download size was like 4.5gb, if I recall.
---
This. This is reasonable.
---
good luck with that
---
dude what are you talking about? All you guys do is bitch and moan.
---
Fuck TBC develop it in a new path. DON'T INCREASE THE LEVEL CAP!
---
next step, listening to the streamers and nerf all content
---
Like the sound of a duck lol
---
https://naibuzz.com/how-much-money-sodapoppin-makes-on-twitch-youtube-net-worth/
---
True
---
That's why we have dkp. So you don't have to decide who gets loot.
---
Jealously over preferential treatment, essentially.
---
I've always maintained 2 accounts, and the second account will likely make boat loads of gold during the first 2 months or so.
---
I can always make a second bank alt on main acct and xfer shit there if I want to get rid of the second acct.
---
If your PC can run BfA, Classic will be *less* demanding than Vanilla. (Modern engine with the old data.)
---
See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQ8w46JOL4
---
I've seen stronger retorts from kids saying "I know you are but what am I."   
---
Then again, if I had actually wanted real come back I'd have wiped my dick on your mom's face afterwards.
---
I liked both Wpvp and BGs so that was Golden Age WoW in my eyes. It all simply boils down to preference.
---
holy shit what are 9 points really gonna change that much. i was arms and MTd ubrs you do not need to be specced prot to tank or resto to heal these guys are just bad.
---
Damn man,  you got me crying in shit. I never got to play WoW growing up, but i was a big fan of Warcraft 3. I just recently started looking into WoW and then i heard about classic, im really struggling to make friends after my move so im hoping itll be a good way to socialize.
---
Your stories great man, those are the kind of memories you hold on to.
---
Yeah exactly my story right there. Gonna be done with my degree next year :)
---
People who can't understand people who compare sharding to layering must not realize those people were going to be hostile to anything that resembled sharding.
---
They also said it will be only for early levels for couple weeks.
---
jeez, the people on this sub might be the most pathetic beings on reddit. 
---
If everyone on Classic would be like the people on this sub, Classic would be dead in a month. Really looking forward to not play with players like you.
---
Supply and command*
---
How are you playing on a VR Headset? I kind of want to do that now‚Ä¶
---
That's not true, you absolutely could.
---
Source: GM got sulfuras, server transferred to better guild next day.
---
I mean, you *can* go there at level 1.
---
WoW tokens can still be used for sub time in classic since classic and BFA share the same subscription.
---
The game is feature complete already, it‚Äôs basically in the state that it will launch in. Big fixes will come later, but what you see is what you‚Äôre gonna get. This test is more about finding catastrophic issues that cause server crashes, stuff broken to the point where it doesn‚Äôt work at all, and making sure it doesn‚Äôt have serious glitches with hardware that is supposed to be supported.
---
Provided people who are picked actually play the game and the stress tests have their intended effect, there‚Äôs no difference between streamers and speed rushers.
---
It came last night at about 10pm pst. :)
---
Oh nice man! I wouldn't mind doing something like that. Did you have to get certified or anything?
---
water looks crapy on every stream I see
---
&gt;Attempting to sign into twitter through the interface option crashes the client
---
That sounds like a feature to me, not a bug &gt;.&gt;
---
You have to be subbed. And you go in your account settings page on bnet, and click the thingy where it says you want to be invited to betas and pick classicwow as something you're interested in.
---
It has not always been a thing, but it is a result of the Legion client that Classic is based on. This was actually confirmed by Blizzard that it is not being removed.
---
The scarlet crusade. Bastards.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been subbed since Vanilla but I‚Äôd take occasional long stretches off.
---
Looks like it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=CgV6Gk7LfK4
---
This place has always been touch and go but everyone pretty much turned into swamp monsters these last few days.
---
Huh!
---
They give keys to non-streamers. A good amount of beta players are nonstreamers. You just don‚Äôt know about them. Because they‚Äôre not streaming.
---
I‚Äôll be just like these guys my man. I haven‚Äôt played in 10+ years and won‚Äôt have a fucking clue what I‚Äôm doing. However, it‚Äôs going to be entertaining as hell waiting people wipe and rage.
---
Sort of, yeah.  A battlegroup that's going to collapse into a single server.
---
The current most popular vanilla server.
---
Wrong. They're updating the framework every expansion to make sure the client is up-to-date with new changes.
---
&gt;Stop Advertising your game
---
FTFY
---
im totally aware that people are against any form of this sort of thing, but expecting there to be no systems in place to help with launch was a totally unrealistic expectation in the first place
---
Yeah I was. I also have a friend at Blizzard who knows I‚Äôve been waiting years for this.
---
Yeah you're not wrong.  To each his/her own.  generating 1 rage per block also lowers the cost of ISB by 2 rage basically so that helps considering def stance is generally very rage starved.  I guess toughness/last stand would be your other points which are quality PVE points.
---
You say that but there isn‚Äôt even water in VC atm
---
I think only streamers should get them. I find it hilarious.
---
There are people who reliably used it in vanilla. May be you played with too low ping to experience that.
---
New models aren't an option? That's a bummer. They could easily have made them a toggle -- that's how they worked in WoD. Some races look way better with the new models. (Not saying they're *all* better, of course, but I do prefer the new night elves and forsaken.)
---
An email last night. :)
---
LEEROY JENKINS!!!!
---
id love new content, based on old content, like after classic wow release mists of panderia, but garrosh obviouslyt wont be thge bad guy.
---
or do a south seas expac.
---
or northrend after classic, then Outland.
---
However i feel it would be best to stay on azeroth, i feel that is more in the spirit of classic. Never introduce flying mounts, which i feel was only down because outland
---
Yes, but they can't be sold on classic for gold, so it won't affect gold farmers in classic at all.
---
I don't even want client side only tbh. I think it slightly chips away at the value of gear. Anything that does that is a no go to me.
---
&gt; as long as you dont use third party programs to replicate inputs, its fine
---
Using software to replicate keystrokes in World of Warcraft has never been against the rules.
---
I believe it brings you X yards away from your opponent.  You use to be able to jump intercepts and be out of hamstring range, but it didn't work against tauren warriors.
---
And suddenly stun abilities and first aid become important again.
---
I‚Äôll try to post more. I just rolled my warrior so now it‚Äôs off to lvl!

---
The point is that you don‚Äôt need any sub to opt in,  anyone can do it.
---
Just get spirit. More spirit better spirit is fine.
---
That's good to hear, I dont want people grinding out gold in classic just for the sake of grinding out gold. But yea, it has me thinking that if it's still tied to your account, unless noone is playing both retail and classic I bet there will be some who are willing to trade retail gold for classic gold/items/etc and vice versa.
---
I'm very curious how the economy will change due to the fact that playtime is account bound and playing retail can earn you playtime.
---
Not if Imp has Phase Shift on right? it's untargetable
---
Only eye of the storm confirmed so far

---
You can still effectively sell someone a token for classic gold.
---
Stay strong brother. Only 3 months until we can all play.
---
Also using heals that we‚Äôre not the max rank available to you.
---
I would like Blizzard to create new items and add them to the existing loot tables of raid/dungeon bosses. It makes the game fresh without really "changing" anything. 
---
But then again the purity sickos probably wouldn't feel like that is a viable option.
---
i disagree with increasing the level cap. Maybe just curve the power creep. people were replacing naxx gear by 67 or so. Maybe just lower a lot of the item levels
---
I don't understand this comment at all.
---
This topic has been discussed to death in dozens of threads throughout both this subreddit and the WoW one. Most people are against it. Use the search function if you'd like to see the past discussions on it.
---
you realize this is only the first wave of invites right? theres going to be many more going out of the next few weeks. just because only large figures get into the beta immediately doesnt mean that nobody else will ever get it. and whos to say theyre not testing stuff? ive seen plenty of streamers testing bugs and whatnot, so yes there are people tearing it apart "like normal testers."
---
You guys need to relax. 
---
Classic's beta testing isn't going to hinge upon a handful of streamers bug reporting, or not. Even if they don't report a single bug they still serve their purpose, which is to show off the game.
---
This is almost identical to how beta rolled out for BfA. Small initial pool and more invites went out as time went on. By the end there was mountains of feedback. The same thing will happen will happen with Classic. 
---
Stop acting like you're doing something noble. We get it. You just want to play the game like we all do. Relax. Either you'll get your invite, or August will be here before you know it.
---
Thanks! Played a few hours today. You‚Äôre gonna love it! Super nostalgic and a superior game all around without all the hand holding and QOL clutter. :)
---
hahahahahahahaha
---
This is an easily googled question... they're going to have WSG, AV, and AB
---
My drink came out my nose when I read Nathan
---
Classic and modern are based on the same base. They don't want to update two (or later even more) different clients. 
---
The Blizzcon demo was an older build which was created when Legion was current.
---
It seems more pronounced because its tauren v tauren.
---
Swifty openly said on his stream he plans on multi-boxing (something about protecting himself from opposite faction stream sniping + the obvious benefit of leveling multiple characters at once). He explained to his viewers that if you are paying for a unique subscription on all the accounts, you are not breaking ToS.
---
You dont make a ptr account, just opt into the beta. then pray
---
The drop down menu may not exist if you dont have PTR, beta or a second wow acocunt tied to your bnet--I've got all that (cause how do you kill that which has no life?)
---
Is layering even going to still be active when aq40 drops?
---
Nah, Nathan is the lawyer
---
there are people testing the game. 
---
there are also key players in generating hype for the game. we knew this was going to be the case. there are the figureheads of this 'HOLY SHIT LOOK AT THIS 9 TOP DAMAGE MACE BRO' type attitudes that get the kids and autismo type people excited. if they want this game to be successful they have to generate the hype. its just good business. annoying, but necessary.
---
pc requirement is to have any pc thats not more then 15 years old basically
---
He really reported that? 
---
"Retail baby" is spot on. Christ they are infants.
---
Yep that's what people were saying, but tbh how many people are still gonna be playing modern wow pretty hardcore? I just feel the only people that would have gold like that on modern are people farming it just to trade it to for classic gold.
---
The market will find it's equilibrium though

Get off my lawn!
---
I never played classic but I played wrath in 4th grade. Still hyped for classic though
---
That's true. Since the bow comes with DM Hunters will have to compete.
---
&gt; Items with randomly generated stats will display the &lt;Random Enchantment&gt; tag in the loot window and chat tooltips when being looted
---
Were there supposed to be random stats on items? That seems like a newer thing. I was under the impression that back then, gear was gear, and you didn't get "McGuffin of the Feverflare" or whatever.
---
Yeah you could trade someone on retail and get gold from them on classic *theoretically*, but that may or may not be against ToS, requires serious trust between the two parties, and there isn't any standardized market for it which means you'd have to negotiate a price somehow.
---
There isn't really a way around that potentially happening, but I doubt it'll be common because of the lack of security.
---
You know what works better than Spirit gear? Eating food/bandaging. I'm not standing around staring at the next mob waiting for my health to regen.
---
Do you really think that they only gave out a hundred or so beta invites? The streamers got keys for hype. Everyone else got keys to test the game. More keys are being given out over time as they ramp up the population. That is part of the beta. Slowly ramping up population and checking for problems.
---
The video shows double that
---
This thread is the most accurate representation of a bug report list that I have ever seen (except it needs to be thousands of entries long). This is honestly just kind of how it goes. There will be several layers of people sorting through it before the developers even get a chance to look at it (necessary evil).
---
What, you won't miss what is the most wretched *hive of scum and villainy* ever,  /wold?
---
I started playing in 2006 and I was 9. Although now I distinctly remember watching Prisoner of Azkaban while waiting for the game to download so it MIGHT have been even earlier than that.
---
Remember, yes, but look up videos of ACTUAL vanilla, and man, my eyes hurt lol
---
I thought order of magnitude was 10 factors?  like 1 is an order of magnitude from 10?
---
Not really. People regularly kite in M+.
---
So if I rush to level 60 and make a friend, they might end up in a different layer after layering takes effect in higher levels? Or am I just misunderstanding? (Probably misunderstanding)
---
lol im taking this class rn
---
Same thing with runescape. Although most people always had to restart because of unstable servers and communities. Same as with WoW amirite
---
is it really shocking to you that the streamer whos running with his viewers gets the legendary?
---
Yup I totally get it. I've seen the layering pie charts but it didn't make much sense. If it were a diagram of stacks it would make more sense.
---
Go outside
---
It is glorified server merging, except that the layers are fluid where servers are not. I would have preferred planned server merges. Tell me why this is preferable.
---
What do you mean by find the time? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking. I had more time when I was under 15 than I did later on.
---
It was also ok for non-fans (my wife), Thrall looks good!
---
This is the trolling I like.

---
Already saying QoL change's are good, not long now till you guys openly accept addon's and other little thing's :D

Is this how normal people say that they want something?
---
Damn, inflation is really that bad in retail?
---
That boss ALWAYS hit like a damn tuck and it was funny watching unaware players get rekt everytime (The same goes for the last boss in BFD)
---
I believe he said he dinged 60 just before the original AQ opening event.
---
That‚Äôs a different thing I‚Äôm certain. The stress test and beta should be two separate things since the stress test is more about how the servers will handle the mass amount of people.
---
Definitely. I remember heavy rain and mist in Wetlands.
---
Although it can also be a case of *memory distortion*; seeing this and the brain going "yup, that's exactly how it was". Humans do that a lot unfortunately.
---
based
---
Classic water was just a repeating texture

BASED
---
I‚Äôm going to love seeing all these mythic plus heroes trying to rush rush rush and wiping.  Vanilla dungeons were slow af because you had to strategize. Mark targets for cc...check to make sure everyone knew which mob they were assigned, drink up, do a countdown prior to a pull.
---
No there's still going to be more invites in the future and stress tests. So I'm sure a lot of people will at least get in for the stress tests.
---
FYI if you didn‚Äôt have an absolute potato of a computer back then this is pretty close to how the weather effects were. My dad had a customer built rig that he used for B rated movie editing back in ‚Äò05 and this is what the weather looked like on his computer when I played WoW on it.
---
Ok lets leave it. Truce. Hope you have a nice rest of your day. Didn‚Äôt want to cause any bad vibes. Nobody wins this shit.
---
Normal melee is 5 yards.  Throw a tauren into the mix and it becomes 7 yards.  Throw two tauren into the mix and it becomes 9 yards.
---
Being a streamer from what I see on Youtube.
---
no im rolling orc i will not get my dreadsteed as im rushing to 60 and i think orc locks look way better on wolves
---
yeah same here, 39s are so much fun, just high enough were it is a crazy time sink that most people will skip, but still achiveable with crazy good twink gear.
---
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
---
and i asked him if reckoning being stored and used to unleash multiple attacks and he also said that wasnt what he intended with it
---
sign me up for whichever server this guy is not on, thanks
---
Tbf a bunch of 7-12 year olds aint gonna make a good wpvp guild
---
Joana, like many of us,  will get invited shortly. They are not done sending Beta invites and will continue to roll them out over the next few weeks. So do not fret.
---
yeah im not gettimt my dreadsteed. maybe further down the line for fun but i like how orc locks look im t2 on a wolf
---
It‚Äôs not for 2 days. The stress tests which are 2 days and aren‚Äôt current are different than the beta.
---
There's dozens of us!

---
TBH I don't think anyone who has played pservers for years should have a learning curve regardless of if they started in cata or not. Tips just gets things wrong because he somehow hasn't educated himself despite playing pservers.
---
Yes. One WoW sub allows access to both classic and retail. WoW tokens for gold are only a thing in retail, but can still be used to purchase in-game time, which you would be able to use to play Classic.
---
Right.. however I was recently thinking since they will be two different games in the launcher you could log on to both characters maybe to secure the trading a little bit more? Dunno just a thought , but I agree the risk of scamming would be extremely high. 
---
It will be interesting to see if it goes against the ToS.
---
How would you feel if they implemented the retail WoW spec-saving system, but with the same costs as Vanilla? So you didn't have to redo your bars and shit, but still had to pay? That would be ideal to me.
---
Also, if you played on a certain private server, they lowered the cap to 25g instead of 50g, and the world didn't end.
---
God forbid some who isn't here all day every day gives their opinion on a topic that got 4 replies a month ago, gotta make room for shitty memes and retail bad!
---
Elitist no-change advocates.
---
Classic and modern share the same base. So you could say it's currently "based" on the 8.1 client (or something like that, I don't play BfA). The Blizzcon demo was an older build, made when Legion was current.
---
In any case, Classic will run on anything which runs BfA, just better. It'll even run better than Vanilla. Modern engine, old simple data.
---
Yeah fuck that guy, somehow in the shitshow that is the classic streamer community he still manages to stand out with how much of a turdwaffle he is.
---
you obviously dont search out for good games. jusy because theres a lot of shitty games now doesnt mean there wasnt a lot of stupid shitty games back then. maybe use google and look for some games lol. cynical old fart
---
Time to report those bugs!
---
1000% agree.  Tho...i did used to bump di.fm vocal trance as i traversed arouhd Darkshore
---
i think that bug was introduced in BFA, i see that happen from time to time on live
---
...K
---
&gt; It shows there's absolutely no reason why he should've gotten an invite over Joana
---
There's no conspiracy here, Joana probably just happens to not follow rule 1 of getting into the beta which was "Be subbed to retail WoW."
---
By ner'zhul! great news :)
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude
---
Going from a one digit number (9) to a two digit number (14) is an increase of one order of magnitude.
---
Classic and modern share the same base. So you could say it's currently "based" on the 8.1 client (or something like that, I don't play BfA).
---
This means that Classic will run on anything which runs BfA, just better. It'll even run better than Vanilla. Modern engine, old simple data.
---
My panties sure are.
---
Some gear was random. That of the feverflare green was randomed it could have been of the monkey instead. It isn't has random as the current game but it random the enchant from a select pool of names.
---
most of the streamers i watch have been very critical of blizzards direction with Wow for a long time, certainly not 'suckling at the teet'
---
and all of them are speedrunning, pushing to get to the next zone or the first dungeon they can do.
---
they are testing the game by playing. how else are you supposed to test it?  
---
you sound jealous you're not in.

This is SO crazy to me. I absolutely cannot fathom why anyone would EVER want this in an MMO. It's so mind boggling why you'd want to appear different from what you're actually wearing. If I'm in PvP, I should be able to infer certain things about players based on their gear and weapons. This idea of transmog, if implemented, would make me never consider playing classic.
---
"&lt;Item name&gt; of strength, of the bear etc. did exist.
---
I played in the original beta and happily, I'm getting to play in the Classic Beta.
---
I think this case &lt;random enchantment&gt; may be referring to 'X of the Owl' or 'X of the Bear' suffixes
---
I haven‚Äôt been reading most of these as sob stories, just personal stories. I actually think it‚Äôs interesting to see all the stories of people in this thread that are at least connected by vanilla WOW.. so thanks for facilitating that even if it wasn‚Äôt your orbital intent.
---
Shocking? No.      
---
Annoying? Yeah, why even bother rolling if you're gonna scream "give it to meeee".

Not sure how long or deep I'll play it, but the stars are aligned it seems, I'm gonna step back in for it. After all, i was a talented 2k disc with a mean grip on offensive gameplay/Mana burn, so, I don't wanna just waste these dormant talents. it's like walking into a house you grew up in but left years ago- it'll be fun, sad, and familiar all at the same time. I learned from Hydra, and kept that playstyle up until leaving in '16
---
This will be neat, I don't think every player is going to be able to stick around through the whole thing because of where we are as a soxeity with twitch-everything, but I'm glad they did it. really stoked to see mounts disappear when you touch water, blowback spells, deep keybind setups, and eye if the beast. I'll be missing a lot of the quality of life improvements but there were a few neat little things in vanilla
---
I've never heard of that but it makes perfect sense
---
You dropped p servers for a beta that lets you level to 30?
---
You sure you actually like classic brah?
---
That might be you but I read stuff like "Ha! This idiot didn't use item x you get at spot y, what a fraud" and other gatekeeping constantly. Who gives a fuck if you did it on a private server or on live, the more people who start playing the better. 
---
I watched his stream for 20 minutes yesterday and they weren't bitching at each other at all and been playing for 16h at that point. No shit you make mistakes, just seems like people use every possibility to shit on streamers. Imagine telling some multiglads that classic is too hard for them.
---
Reporting this as a bug and deleting items is pretty poor though, I'll give you that.
---
&gt;t wasn‚Äôt in the FUCKING game back in 2004-2005
---
Based on the childish way you type, neither were you.
---
Played 04 just graduated school, albeit Master's.
---
i appreciate the paladin info.  What do you say about getting the 3% hit in prot tree?
---
in regards to the guide,  I am looking at joannas and https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-leveling-guides/ . I guess since they have speed leveling in mind they cater more to the classes that scale less with specific gear. Paladin solo is very slow. 
---
Do you recommend your route for leveling quickly? 
---
which i think joanna said he used heavily to influence his alliance runs.
---
These guides often only include uldaman and ZF as dungeoning is otherwise slow.
---
I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt have a list of stuff that they are fixing already, but most bugs are either going to be kicked down the road. Stuff you report now isn‚Äôt going to be fixed before launch. See BFA beta for a clear example of this.
---
it is not but thats when most people would head over there
---
Which occluded view.
---
that guild will just become a bunch of social outcasts who dont get to do anything with anyone outside of the guild because nobody wants to do anything with them or be involved with them in any way, honestly shouldnt worry too much about it. and its pretty likely that anyone with the goal of just harassing other people wont make it very far to begin with
---
Do I need to actually Subscribe or will only buying 30 days game time suffice?
---
I wasn't expecting no system - that doesn't mean there isn't another system I would have preferred.
---
They will be letting more people in once they start their server stress tests.
---
He is a clown. Imagine being this childish.
---
Except I do look for games. Non stop. My crew of friends and I are always looking for the next new awesome game to play together like we did EQ, classic wow, diablo 2 and 3, LoL etc. There just isn't anything now. Retail wow, anthem, fortnite, apex legends to name a few.  All garbage. Try again uninformed young person.
---
hes also playing with a priest and a paladin so that might have something to do with him not having to eat. and he might be using alot of spirit gear as well to help with downtime
---
Because its two tauren, so everything becomes +4 yards.  Melee range is now 9 yards instead of 5, dead zone is going to be at 10 yards instead of 6, and minimum shoot range is going to be at 12 yards instead of 8.
---
Soda (horde) vs Asmond (alliance)
---
Just like every time I load Super Mario Bros into the old Nintendo Entertainment System, I have an aneurysm, shit myself, and die.
---
&gt; you didnt post anything that proves me wrong about it being an intended feature. to be fair i cant prove it was unintended either but ill go ask the wow vanilla class designer and see what he says
---
That was your defense. That I couldn't prove to you it wasn't intended. Well I proved to you it wasn't intended. Now I get to enjoy how you move the goalposts / backpedal. Lol.

&gt; especially in light of one of the limiting factors of private servers was debuff slots, so that will give more flexibility with 16 from the start.

Most of the times Tips died he could have been saved by Soda if Soda was actually paying attention and precasting heals like he was supposed to. Even the clipped wipe on the big boss.
---
They were streamers or media probably, so they were not randomly selected, but picked and flagged for beta by hand. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, please ‚Äî it will make me happy, I‚Äôm not subbing to get a CHANCE to get into beta.
---
Then your server was allowing transfers for balance. The were no paid transfers in vanilla. It's why server reputation was a legit thing in vanilla. I played it vanilla at a very high raid level. We could only recruit from our server because the transfers didn't exist. At least not on lightning's blade US

Not gonna lie, part of the reason I'm looking forward to rolling a tank is the kind of attitude you need to have.  Sometimes it's important to say things like *"hunter, if you pull like that again, I will kick you."*
---
There's nothing wrong with mistakes, and we're all here to play and learn and have fun.  But part of having such a community driven game also means letting people know that some asshattery won't be tolerated.  DPS who can't focus targets or who pull without regards to things need to be reminded that's not okay, and in my experience it falls on the tank to play that role, even if it means they come across as a bit of a diva.

Crater of Azshara 80v80 but only for players level 5, 27 and 43.

Sometimes it seems like half of this sub wasn't alive during classic.

Isn't that phase 3? So at launch there will be no BG's?

I won't care at all. All specs are welcomed. Only specs not welcomed are slackers, and bad vibes.
---
I think it was mostly that these players act a little cocky and that they know everything, and then they do everything in the textbook that is wrong....
---
It‚Äôs whatever, I‚Äôll point fun at them because I honestly don‚Äôt like streamers regardless of who the streamer is. I just have never gotten into the whole streaming thing. However, if you talk you‚Äôre self up like you‚Äôre the next best thing since sliced bread, you better show it.
---
It‚Äôs going to be a clash between pserver players, veterans, retail players, and new players so Classic may sink or swim if any of those different factions can‚Äôt get along. However, I do feel everyone will be much more forgiving to each other when it is released.

I‚Äôm not in the beta gotta be the worst bug of them all
---
There's a story to it - Esfand did it to Staysafe before, so it's kind of an in-joke between them. Obviously if you do it to strangers you're a dogshit human being, but this \*is\* a beta.
---
Second this
---
I'm not even complaining, I hope they manage to get it closer to fair. This is EXACTLY what I meant by not being able to have a dialogue with you.
---
Always on the attack. Pitiful.
---
It's fine in premades.
---
Nope they were random people. MULTIPLE cases prove this is wrong.
---
Yeah but everyone will be downing rag in month 1

---
You anecdotal experience does not beat statistics. This is a universal truth. If you don't accept that you might as well become a flat-earther.
---
the same reason you attend a funeral tbh.
---
That‚Äôs subjective. Your melee range increases.. this tends to confuse people in pvp as they are accustomed to kite a deadzone distance that will actually put them in melee range vs Tauren.
---
Some people would call it an advantage. I don‚Äôt but some do.
---
did i know much about endgame? no. did i and do i know much about leveling from 1-20? absofuckinglutely. what's there to know? it's just quest/mob memorization and common sense routing. when you do the same quests and zones over and over again on multiple alts you end up pretty efficient at it.
---
This is why I believe streamers are literally the worst thing about the wow community.
---
Because we didn't think the game would be this broken
---
Which is one of the few things that the #nochanges crowd accepts
---
DW arms for overpower fuckin madness and anger management until Whirlwind axe MY FUCKIN DUDE.
---
The frontal temple cortex.
---
The whole point of Classic is to bring back Vanilla because it was changed into something else. So no changing Classic ever!
---
Everything else can be talked about later. Whatever they are, they should be separate from Classic.
---
Personally I'd be happy to have TBC servers.
---
Finally your discord got a hold of the post, welcome
---
his settings were everything max but water
---
They really are testing everything that gets suggested. And anything parallel to suggestions. Been good streams.
---
They need 3 months to test this? Not only that, they gave a bunch of invites to people that don't even remember most of the stuff from vanilla.
---
Well than, you made me happy :)
---
So the question now is - can they play without subbing after they receive beta invite? I guess not
---
I think any expectation of private server-esque free-for-all went out with the exact panel referenced by my meme (this is the first time the question was addressed). People pretty immediately accepted that there would be SOMETHING to address the initial hype population in the same way they seem to have immediately accepted layering. Between then and now it was only a question of what they would do, anyone still calling for absolutely nothing was definitely in a pretty small minority by that point.
---
Nice try, Alex.

You know what a beta is for?

---
Agreed. It's better than broken servers and as long as it's short term I'm ok with it. I just want it to be as short as possible.
---
I really hope they keep all the 5 mans nice and difficult for their level. Going to make 1-60 so much more memorable and fun. So pumped for maraudon, scholo, and strath
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say - Yeah, no.
---
Since I didn't get the beta I joined a private server to kind of demo it. I figure I'll play to lvl 30 or so to get used to old mechanics then wait to play at Classic launch
---
It's cool that disguising their post as an ironic meme gets them past the rule of spreading misinformation.
---
We‚Äôre here to make fun of you. Soy
---
I like how everyone is taking the high horse as soon as streamers fuck up and act like they would never make a mistake while trying to keep 60k people entertained in the process after already being live for 20 hours, then go on a thread and bullet point list every mistake that played into a wipe in Wailing Caverns of all places.
---
Just sit back and laugh like everyone else does.
---
Important question is facestabbing possible? Assuming not because pretty sure that's a pserver glitch with the mobs but very interesting to see what will be happening in the classic client. I'm also looking to find out if we have to use lua code or modern macro code as it is in retail.
---
"**Phase 3:** Alterac Valley and Warsong Gulch" Yes launch is just wpvp but pvp ranks won't be added until phase 2.
---
It was confirmed in an interview with Ion that Classic will start with 16 debuff slots from the start. The reason it was less before was technical issues with data limits. 
---
It was at the blizzcon Q&amp;A 2018 I believe, I'll see if I can hunt out the source for you. 
---
It will change the meta I believe.

I have yet to see him play beta without his friend on a mic playing as a human paladin
---
Joana is also coming back so maybe he'll break his own record.
---
I played this char at level 49 and got Blood Guard.  
---
Fun times one-shotting people with windfury.
---
Yeah thats not a meme im interested in banking on, don can keep it
---
Yup.  In vanilla weather effects went up approx 25 feet from any surface (with a small bubble/tube around you when on a flight path.  Since flightpaths were static this was easy to program.
---
With flying, it would have had to render up to 1500 feet, and that was way too much for their system at the time.
---
Not any more it don't!
---
Like I said my man it‚Äôs all subjective I don‚Äôt think one can really be claimed as better it just depends on what you prefer.
---
You‚Äôre the joke mate
---
No, they had to sub to log in.
---
You can follow Joanna's guide, that's what I did. 
---
I made sure to read ahead and understand when Joanna is doing something only Hunters need to do (like jumping back to Teldrasil to get spells / training, or farming some rare pet.)
---
For Paladin leveling to be fun you're definitely going to be more gear dependant, which means trying to get at least some of those 2H upgrades.
---
In terms of a quest-by-quest guide specifically for Paladins, I don't think one exists, but Joanna's guide is also made to show you which quests are relevant and which ones are just wastes of time in general, so it's still a good path to follow.
---
&gt; What do you say about getting the 3% hit in prot tree?
---
Absolutely not worth how expensive it is.
---
Why would me ignoring a beta of a 15 year old game mean I would stay on p servers?
---
I would prefer blizzard just use a newer mangoes client and put their GMs/Admins on the servers and be done with it.
---
I have no interest leveling to 30....again hahah
---
Hmmm I could go level a toon that wil be deleted in a few weeks or go play on a thriving p server hmmmm.. Which should I pick
---
If you like the game there is only one option
---
&gt; you'll require a higher level friend to run you through SFK (or an extremely generous party.)
---
Am I missing something? SFK can be done in the early 20s...
---
The link in the OP does go up to WotLK and a bit into Cataclysm.
---
And is more indicative of a YouTube problem than a Classic streamer problem, no? I try not to hate on people just trying to make a living.
---
That‚Äôs the spirit!
---
Funny when I googled it all I got were forum posts from people speculating
---
Multi boxing won't have nearly as much of an economical impact as it does in retail given you can have 40 characters harvest each node 40 times. So I doubt it'll be off limits if it's not on retail.
---
I love it!   
---
I spend every mod and researching making every game I play harder.   
---
Playing with people like that is fun. HardMode!
---
nobody:
---
staysafe: wait everyone SHHH
---
Good point there. But I remember that Molten Core would take an entire weekend to clean and to find a guild being a casual... well...
---
To look cool and not look like you are in a clown suit?
---
I'm hoping they'll have the philosophy of "Classic is meant for people who want a difference experience. Might we suggest current retail WoW?"
---
Hahahaha nice advice! XD
---
upvoted to try and get some of that luck
---
The one true Warrior's name:

---
I wonder why so many restored old characters have broken gear?
---
you only proved that the designer didnt make seal of righteousness as the main seal of proccing extra item attacks. but thats how it ended up being and it should stay like that. go ahead and ask him if it was his intention for paladins to be a healer class that stands back and im sure he will say its not his intention. 
---
and in other part of the arguement i was saying just because somethings not intended doesnt mean its a bug and i said reckoning is proof. it was not intended but once they found out about it they put a cap on its charges and kept it in the game. but you said reckoning was always intended to act the way it does and so that wasnt an unintended feature. but i asked kevin jordan and he said it was never intended to be used as a way to get crit and store up chargers and unleash on someone. it was more of a get crit, and you get an extra attack for that hit
---
&gt; That's your fault.
---
Dude... lol.
---
I hope so since I still don't have one either
---
A lot of people don't seem to understand what a true alpha is nowadays. 
---
True dev alphas are: Some of the core function is complete and some isn't like: combat may be fully implemented but gathering could just be not implemented at all.
---
True betas are: All core features and art are implemented and designed, but they still have issues like; being able to shoot through walls or falling through the ground and stuff
---
what? ofc i am. whats with the entitlement? :S
---
Having to play the game 10+ hours every day is a big meme. You can chill for an hour or two, even less, and still make friends and have a good time.
---
Will you be king of the hill, known to all the neckiest of beards on the server and have your own personal army of bootlickers every time you stand on IF bridge or Org bank roof? No.
---
But you're 35, so I don't expect you to value stuff like that anymore. Appreciate the quality of time you spend ingame, not the amount of time.
---
**&lt;Byte Club**\&gt;
---
I had a random thought, which lead to an idea that might or might not be something I turn into a reality, which is why I'm making this post; to try and get a reaction and see what people think.
---
**The short version:** create a guild for serious players who like me also have to deal with life so they are forced to play as filthy casuals (that was a joke), but who ALSO either know how to program or are interested in programming. I'd call the guild: "*Byte Club*".
---
**Tiny bit of background:** I'm currently a student studying Software Engineering (mostly C++, a little DirectX11/12) with a slight background in video game design, in Sweden. Next year will be my 5th and (hopefully) last year. I'm really looking forward to playing some classic WoW, even if it won't be in a more hardcore manner, but I thought doing so with a bunch of like-minded people could be an interesting experience.
---
Thoughts? (:
---
P.S. Since I'm already posting, to any C++ (possibly C too) programmers out there; I'm currently working on an Isometric game engine that I'm hoping is going to turn out quite user friendly, with some (hopefully) decent guides. (Y)**Region:** EU
---
**Realm/Prospect Realm Type:** PVP
---
**Faction/Prospective Faction:** Alliance

**Timezone/Active Hours:** *(GMT+2)* Sweden

My only gripe tbh is that it's releasing at the end of August. Yes yes, get all astronomical saying how it's still a part of Summer, but c'mon... people are going back to school and classes and stuff, you'd think you'd want as many people as possible playing your game, right??
---
Not a very Classic Summer. Should've been July.
---
Normally it is sent via PM, and not commented. If you see a comment that you think violates our rules, please report it so the mods have a chance to check it out. We don't/can't do a deep dive in all the posts.
---
Obviously lol. 
---
Alright that's good to know, thank you.
---
Right, actually had no idea either but as soon I saw the troll hunter face I immediately remembered.
---
it was definitely heavy like this. the best part was if you jumped enough the rain would bug out and come down in big clumps instead of a steady stream. hope you can do that.
---
looked at the video and hp regen is way lower at lvl 15s+ than the shit I am seeing on streams.
---
Yeah I wont ever join a guild that does loot council. It needs to be some sort of participation system.
---
This is retail as well. Like 90% of the retail playerbase claims to have been playing since Vanilla.
---
That's strange since 
---
&gt; Nonetheless, we‚Äôve fixed some fairly high-priority issues:
---
&gt; ...
---
&gt; Dodge, Parry, and Miss were all not happening often enough.
---

---
You have 11% chance to miss if your weapon skill is 30 against lvl 10.
---
Right! Thanks, had completely forgotten about that trinket.
---
2.5 hours to level 10 is considered a pretty decent time back in vanilla. Were you attempting to level quickly, or were you just casually leveling?
---
On a real note, you should check out the guild recruitment Discord channel. You‚Äôll find every type of guild possible. Guilds for dads with kids, late night or early morning guilds and everything in between. 
---
You‚Äôll have enough time for sure.
---
Haha you're such a pathetic narcissist.
---
Uhm no it's based on whatever client version is the current one
---
You're a horrible person. I don't usually have much sympathy for hunters, but damn.
---
i don't recall my exact fastest 1-20 in vanilla but it was no fewer than 14 hours and no more than 16. a rogue i believe. before i even got a character to 60 i was addicted to re-rolling around level 30-40 just because leveling was so goddamn fun.
---
I wish I could, I hate that thing... it persists inside arena, and always throws me off when I face people with it &gt;.&gt;
---
You're dumb as fuck if you read that as "noone can".
---
Also, you're retarded if you think a person can believe that.
---
Unless you're leveling as prot, no one wastes money to respec tank spec to do a leveling dungeon.
---
Post locked.
---
Your example is not only wrong, but also racist that that is the first place your mind goes. If statistics show that a certain ethnicity committed more crimes per capita than a different ethnicity. Saying "that ethnicity is more likely to commit crime" and then you arguing telling me that I am wrong because not all of certain ethnicity commit crimes is meaningless and taking my argument out of context. That doesn't mean I'm committing a fallacy
---
&gt;Agree that porting is always, always a lot harder than it seems. However, a lot of what I am seeing seems pretty controversial tbh. Blizzard is running into a bunch of 14 year old memories and private server feedback. There are going to be bugs without a doubt but my first impression is that a lot of current "common" knowledge is going to be wrong. The classic team have handled this sort of thing really well in the past so I think they will be fine.
---
Well in that perspective, private servers are also in a sense getting "deleted" when Classic hits. They'll all be dead essentially. So we're talking semantics here; a beta for a few weeks or a private server for a few months. Does it really matter?
---
Dude, your comments are really really fucking sad and sound like a terrible mash up of r/iamverybadass and r/gamingcirclejerk
---
"DAE think games today have no soul and big bad corporations ruined fun games?" has been said a million times by people like you in an endless circle jerk that will never end
---
Hey buddy! If you are able to squeeze in a little play time with your busy schedule I would definitely recommend doing it! i work seven days a week, usually half day on Sunday. I still play wow although I‚Äôm not the fastest leveler, and gearing takes a little longer. However if you can stick it out to 60, i am sure there will be plenty of guilds that offer different raid times to fit your schedule. It might take a little poking around, but you will find one eventually.
---
There are a lot of people in positions similar to us. I think this time around server progression, and the leveling experience will be a lot different, just based on the kind of demographic that will be playing. 
---
There will absolutely be speed levelers, and younger players with almost no time constraints, devouring content. However this time around there will be a lot more players like us. Weekend warriors some may call us. Good luck have fun!
---
Not solo'd, which many Paladins try to do because putting together an Alliance party for SFK *can* be daunting‚Äîespecially if it's only because you need a quest item halfway through. 
---
Kind of like poor, unfortunate Warriors desperately trying to put together RFK groups for their class quest. 
---
Don't forget that SFK is really far away from level 20ish Alliance questing areas, relatively deep in Horde territory.
---
If I don't look like a retarded clown, then that's not a true classic experience
---
But i said madness and anger and used big letters. Therefore better.
---
&gt; But you're 35, so I don't expect you to value stuff like that anymore. Appreciate the quality of time you spend ingame, not the amount of time.
---
This is quite true. One thing I've been thinking in doing differently from back then, is reading the entire quest logs. Understanding the small stories and dramas of the NPCs and the lore that I forgot. We'll see... still... raiding with 40 people again... that would be awesome... or not XD
---
Weather effects are back big time in BfA. The rain may not look as THICC but there's weather in almost every zone in the game. There's even rain in the Culling of Stratholme dungeon: [https://i.imgur.com/c2culxU.png](https://i.imgur.com/c2culxU.png)

---
I'm unsure if anyone here has experienced the same abundance of green item that drops in the open world like me. Every streamer I watch and the green just drops so frequently that it could reduce the value of them.
---
Tribe, Kraunz, and Perplexity have tested and submitted reports for everything they and the viewers can think of.
---
While everyone else levels, which is fine too.
---
From what ive read, no one on F&amp;F got in yet. People said they were on the list but arent in yet.
---
Yes! You can totally find a casual guild that does 1 maybe 2 nights. You and many of us are in wildly different positions in life from when we first played.
---
I'm in the same boat. I won't be able to no life like I did. Wife. Kids. Career. But damn I will play and I will enjoy it.
---
Y'know, just literally changed the continents, nbd.
---
 Server divided into smaller realms that would merge into the parent realm. Like Cyclone realm consists of Cyclone1, cyclone2, cyclone3 up to whatever it takes. Each realm has no sharding, no layers, none of that shit. Each has seperate eco system and will be merged when population dies down. Player cant abuse this by hopping between servers(like he could between layers). 
---
 Even simple idea of making more servers and merging them later is closer to authentic classic experience than what they are doing now.
---
there's only 1 real way that transmog would ever possibly be allowed and that's if only YOU see it on your character.
---
The real problem with transmog though is that you then get people running dungeons and stuff and Needing on items because "It goes with my Transmog". THIS is the real problem with this system in Classic, especially how some of the more rarer items take so much time to actually get them to drop. Due to this I really doubt we ever get this as an option.

Thank you! This will actually help! Best regards!

I'd prefer if they don't release BC and make a Classic+ as it should have been years ago.

No flying mount, no arena, no small world.

I mean, you salty that YOU don‚Äôt have beta, if you got a beta invite yesturday would you have made this post? Think about that.
---
Hey look I changed a single pronoun and invalidated your last two comments! Have a nice day
---
lolwut, you can integrate your twitter into retail wow?
---
I actually totally agree with you... there's this holier than thou attitude that these ex wow players turned "Adults" have where its almost like a justified excuse.. Noone forced you to pro create or to go be a full time wage slave.
---
"few weeks" can turn into months when it comes to Blizzard, do you really need examples of their soft lies and broken promises? 
---
  About better options. Server divided into smaller realms that would merge into the parent realm. Like Cyclone realm consists of Cyclone1, cyclone2, cyclone3 up to whatever it takes. Each realm has no sharding, no layers, none of that shit. Each has seperate eco system and will be merged when population dies down. Player cant abuse this by hopping between servers(like he could between layers).

And a special appearance by the infamous Stormshroud armor set, even at the time I got teased for wearing that garbage but 15year-old me thought it was the best thing ever...
---
I have an HTC Vive and was using the Vive wands but I just bought parts to make my own MMO specific controller. While you can use the vr controllers I just found I didn't have enough buttons so I've planned out two 15 button onenhanded controllers with a joystick on the right one. As for how to just get WoW running in VR I have a post on it here
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9x4iza/i_will_level_160_completely_in_vr_hmd_treadmill/
---
Now that the release is right around the corner I'm going to start throwing up some youtube vids and probably stream it all on launch
---
Yup, can be hard enough to debug at times let alone when what's actually "right" is being questioned (and not always in good faith).  All told seems like they're going to have their hands full for a bit
---
I'm sure there are going to be way more casual guilds than there will be "hardcore" guilds, especially this time around, for the reasons you listed.
---
From Private Server experience, MC can be cleared in an evening, not even with a somewhat knowledgeable and prepared group, even if the raid is not fully manned. I would not worry too much about stuff like MC, once people are getting into Naxx, that is what will separate the "casuals" from the "hardcore" especially when it is first released.
---
&gt; For Paladin leveling to be fun 
---
I guess im just looking to be efficient, I remember losing so much time going after certain pieces of gear only to replace them with a quest item later.
---
If you get verigans fist at 20 its amazing, but then you realize SFK has bosses all the way up to 26. 
---
Im just trying to plan out what i do when the game launches to stay somewhat ahead, if the time investment is worth it. considering on a fresh launch not many people will be much levels higher than me, so carries arent an option.
---
I'm getting a second degree while working my regular job and some of my friends are in college for the first time after going into the workforce right out of high school. Totally possible.
---
I did Google it unfortunately due to previous Google searches and clicks I was only being directed to form post speculating.
---
The good news is someone provided me a link so the post is no longer necessary.
---
Before removing posts it is important to understand that the Google algorithm takes many factors into account including websites you have already visited, latent semantic indexing, word placement priority and more. Essentially this means two people googling the same thing can receive wildly different results.

cannot sheep a mob attacking another player.
---
Yeah I find it kind of ridiculous. I've got a ton of irl friends who played in Vanilla/TBC, and will play with me in Classic and none of them are pissed about layering. Honestly it seems like an excellent idea to a very real problem that did not exist in vanilla. Is it perfect? No not really, but we don't have enough information on how it will work.

Exactly 37.

I always try to change ‚Äúefficient‚Äù to ‚Äúfun‚Äù in my posts because I get mass-downvoted by smooth-brained carebears who hate the idea that being efficient = fun. To me they're the same.

Doing lots of damage and not wasting time are part of what makes playing WoW fun.

&gt; If you get verigans fist at 20 its amazing, but then you realize SFK has bosses all the way up to 26.
---
This is the biggest problem, especially for a fresh server. SFK is really more of a horde dungeon. To get an Alliance party willing to leave their questing hubs and trek *aaaaalll* the way over there (wasting possibly half their day) just to do a Paladin a favor has always been the biggest wall to getting VF.
---
This is why all guides put VF in parenthesis and only recommend it if you know you have a level 60 friend willing to carry you. Otherwise, just keep Smite's until SM.
---
&gt;  pro create
---
If you pro create then you will casual create.
---
So here's my two cents on this.
---
People at Blizzard are not idiots. Well some are, every work place has it's fair share of idiots. But that is beside the point. 
---
Point is, streamers with many viewers = free advertising. Blizzard knows this, they also know the streamers. Blizz staff are on reddit too, they follow twitch, they know 
---
the same, if not more, about the streamers as we do. Hell this one fuckup during WC dungeon got attention of more people than any of the other streamers who are 'properly' testing it.
---
Blizz almost certainly had a meeting or two with a list of all streamers they want to have in the first beta wave for xyz reason with a quick overview of who these guys are and who to take more serious when it comes to bug reporting etc. 
---
Some braindead streamer reporting the damage of certain mobs to be too high...he will probably get a more unique reply than just a random people would, but at the end that reply will have the same conclusion "it is working as intended". Now is *enter name of streamer* a good person? I don't know. I don't know him. Wouldn't be the first people to put on a mask in public to make a living off of it no matter what. Bottom line, Blizzard is very aware of the knowledge and skills of the picked streamers. If I'd be in marketing at Blizzard, hell yeah I would pick the ones with the most viewers. As for deleting items, being a ninja etc...just keep doing it and you're reputation will be so bad you won't get anywhere anymore. That simple. 
---
As for 'kiddies', just teach them. Every single one of you was new once, even in Vanilla. It's up to them to take or leave your advise. It's their reputation in the end.
---
Retail players keep forgetting or don't know how much it's about reputation in Classic when it comes to grouping. 
---
Anyways...Happy almost Friday!
---
I was 8 when wow launched. At the time I played only trial accounts.
---
Needed to let the druid drink &gt;&gt; pre-HOT &gt;&gt; start drinking as he pulled.
---
Nah, the early character creation is just to reserve names and give you a fast track to logging in if there aren't any server issues at launch, since you have to log into the server first to create a character.
---
How many bugs are famous streamers who don't know vanilla going to glaze over?  Most of them my dude.
---
This is only the beginning.
---
Back during Blizzcon he hosted a dueling tournament and reported someone for ‚Äútrolling a community event‚Äù for jumping on top of dueling players in bear form and getting more people to do it. Imagine being so butthurt by something so stupid.
---
hahahaha.
---
From what I've heard they say they will lunch it based on the community feedback... so... we'll have to wait and see how the hardcore guys will play the game... I guess.
---
I do often but honestly most people on my server seem excited for it.  There are some people that shoot it down, but they get ganged up on.
---
most of the pserver player base think they are
---
We all know you don't really exist before the age of 12, so you couldn't have played before then. It's logic!
---
As far as I remember, the armour in those slots got converted to Plate/Removed from the game.
---
I assume this is a troll. If not this may be the dumbest thing I‚Äôve read today
---
Not the op, but he said it somewhere in his Paladin 1-10 vid on YouTube.  Sorry I don‚Äôt have a time though. (Was just bored watching it and remember him bringing it up)
---
Lmao you gotta earn those though!
---
This is exactly why I don't want to see polling like OSRS. Take us to TBC and WotLK if you're going to poll anything it should be what to remove.
---
Let's call it an unconscious bias. You didn't even know you did it. No one is blaming you. It's ok.
---
&gt;You'll see.
---
Not until it's too late.
---
Lol all the negativity in your posts and I'm the problem. Have fun playing or don't I really don't care. I'll be enjoying it have a good day my dude.
---
Grade 7 was the best 4 years of my life.
---
I'd probably still be in school if I didn't drop out because of WoW itself.  
---
(34yo)
---
You don't seem to be familiar with what a "beta test" actually entails, do you?
---
I‚Äôm 31 and I have a full time job and a SO that I live with. We work opposite shifts so I‚Äôll have 6 hours a day during the week and 7 hours on Saturday to play. And we will spend Sunday together. It works out nice.
---
I'm burning banks on p servers
---
I already did the work I can now consume to my hearts content. Buying rocket boots, flasks, and thorium nades
---
The beginning of an MMO is about building a bank...lol
---
Ok thanks. But you still didn't respond to my actual point and just acted like an asshole. So you suck.
---
AFAIK demo ticked every 2.5 seconds instead of every 5 seconds, so yeah, demo HP regen was effectively doubled.
---
Today is Thursday and there is no simple Sunday thread to be found.
---
the question has been answered already so there's really no need to argue about this anymore
---
So many things mentioned are Blizz just not removing retail things for convience
---
Personally I want the "suggest an invite" feature removed, all it does it save you one whisper. This is classic just whipser
---
Im well aware of what I did. It isn't what you think it is, it isn't bias. If your opening premise isn't based on logic or facts it isn't worth wasting your time on reading the rest. 80% of the time ish. Not always, but more often than not. That 20% is why the fallacy exist, that is not this
---
Ah, so it's not that they are broken, just that they are no longer equippable by your character.
---
&gt; To get an Alliance party willing to leave their questing hubs and trek aaaaalll the way over there (wasting their time) just to do a Paladin a favor is damn near impossible.
---
i have a friend playing priest, who wants the robes and says he is willing to do it once. But 1-20 is damn near 14 hours and i dont think my friends are gonna pull an all nighter like me. I am worried that getting verigans fist will rely on whats happening at the time.
---
Are you playing paladin? Is your plan to group level with dungeons?
---
I don't know anything about Tips but this hate brigade is a bit lame.
---
For the most part I will want the "proper" specs for all the classes
---
Prot Warriors need certain talents, but past those one I don't mind as much. They need imp shield block, last stand, imp threat, imp sunder, shield slam, etc.
---
Priests should all be 21/30/0, with 1 being shadow
---
Paladins should mostly all be the same(something like 31/15/5 for all improved blessings) with at least one going 30/21/0 for Blessing of sanc. No rets sorry, it's too meme-y for me.
---
Mages will be arcane frost, with 1 or 2 deeper into frost for winters chill( likely the mage or mages who pvp the most)
---
Rogues will be mostly combat swords. Might have a Hemo rogue
---
Locks should all be 30/0/21 Sm/Ruin, maybe one DS/Ruin for improved Imp buff.
---
Druids are free to be 24/0/27 or deep resto. I wouldn't mind one of each. No boomkins. We will 100% have a feral Druid as a dedicated offtank.
---
This guy is such a tool
---
If only I didn‚Äôt play vanilla Pservers for the last 5 years. I wish I could go in fresh again.
---
That‚Äôs not true. Less than half of students finish their 4 year degree on time, meaning even less will make it to their masters on time.

Asmongold could get 10k viewers sleeping, he doesn't need to bait people into watching his stream.
---
Just sounds like vanilla isn't the game for you.  There are plenty of other games out there that offer what you want.
---
Who cares? I don't want to see a bunch of perfect looking toons. I also don't want to see a toon who is actually wearing end-game gear appearing in low level stuff. It defies the authenticity of the game and the experience. If you want to look cool, do the hard work to earn a full, matching gear-set.
---
Yeah i feel like this isn‚Äôt super uncommon at all I‚Äôm 21 and started playing wow when I was 6-7 and played on and off till current, was playing Diablo 2 before that. People tend to think they‚Äôre the only generation that exists it‚Äôs weird
---
Lol. I don't mind. It was always for casuals and the masses. Millions played the game and even more will play it again.   
---
Higher the pop the better!
---
It will probably be a success but it wont be THAT popular.. its just hyped  right now.
---
As a "young" 49 year old dude, if I can come back to classic anyone can. We all have something else going on and I'm just going to take my time and enjoy it before I start ganking the kids, or they start ganking me.
---
Don‚Äôt worry dude, I‚Äôm coming back as a 41 year old. I‚Äôd like to get a guild of people in our situation. If we can get enough people even at a few hours a week per person there would always be some of us on.
---
how about who cares? just play the games you wanna play and enjoy them. stop worrying about what other people are doing lol
---
I am playing Paladin. And yes, I'm totally going to focus on running dungeons mostly because that's the funnest part of WoW to me.
---
Every F&amp;F person I know (myself included) didn't get in. With that said the in game population looks so sparse I'd expect them to add more people daily. Help spread people out so zones aren't over populated.
---
That is true, but I participated in a number of those very big private server launches and in my experience the thinning is much more rapid than anyone seems to account for - and more rapid than layering accounts for (because it's not really necessary for a region like Eastern Plaguelands to be layered at any point, and yet it will be). 
---
Elwynn at the very instant the server drops, absolutely crazy. Westfall, crazy but less so, and so on. The difficulty is in pinpointing the actual places where layering would cease to be necessary, and the rate at which places where it was previously necessary fall off that list. There is never a point where it would be necessary to shard Tanaris, for example, in my experience and in my opinion, because the leveling rates of people are varied enough that not an unsustainable number of people are ever there at any one time. Duskwood might need to be layered just as the bell curve hits lv 20, but not before or afterward. This is all hypothetical; my only point is that what you're suggesting is not impossible but I do understand what you are saying. If it was literally just the first regions that were layered then it would feel like a population explosion when you step into Westfall. I think there's a middle ground. THAT SAID, this wasn't my preferred alternative in any case - I wanted planned server merges!
---
The more noobs I run into, the more HKs I can collect. I don‚Äôt mind one bit.

The more the merrier!

This... actually explains it very clearly. Thanks!

No, the demo was based on legion. Beta is based on BFA.

No, this post ruined classic wow for me.

argal is level 26 or 27, i dont remember much about the levels i was doing SFK at but can a group of 20s do it?

My point is, how many bugs are going to fail to be addressed because testers don't think it's a bug/they don't notice it/etc?

Yes, both of those are plate armor now, which cannot be worm by a shaman, but used to be mail in vanilla.

I would really like a source please.

No one sane ever said that, so you obviously shouldn't cite it.

Plenty of 1080p vanilla videos here https://www.youtube.com/user/TheClassicWoWMovies/videos
---
If you have any warcraftmovies video on your computer and upload it to youtube it will be good quality. Or literally any video that was not butchered by old youtube.
---
No, this video is not accurate. Taurens couldn't melee each other at 20 yrds
---
I'm not going to reply to each point you made because I asked the majority of my questions were hypothetical for the purpose of illustrating that there are still a *lot* of uncertainties about the specifics and not because I haven't made my own educated guesses to their answers. And, as a software developer myself, I mostly agree with your hypotheses about how the system will be implemented.
---
&gt; Because our fingerprints do not match, and because our addons can each determine this information and because they can communicate with each other, our addons can recognize that I am on a different layer than you. 
---
I got what you meant by side-channels, but I don't think I was clear that my question was not with the logic itself but its reliability in a practical scenario. My first inclination is to be skeptical because the second someone logs in or logs out the finger print changes. No matter how small the sample interval is, there is always going to be some uncertainty due to the unpredictability of the exact moment players will log in or off and from which zone and so there will always be some amount of guesswork, and in fact the amount guesswork increases with population. How significantly that guesswork affects the correctness of the addon, I don't know; maybe it wouldn't. But that is what I meant when I initially said I don't think it will be possible to work reliably. 
---
I think I initially made it seem like I think layering is a fool-proof system with impenetrable protection that make it impossible to abuse. But I don't believe that at all; working in software has taught me that it's almost impossible to prevent all forms of abuse with 100% certainty. I'm not trying to say that it is going to be absolutely impossible to abuse the system. Rather, I think it is not going to be nearly easy enough to abuse to a point that is actually damaging to the health of the game or community. Every potential abuse you outlined or that I have seen others outline, I think, is fairly obvious, and I have faith that the developers have enough sense to consider these possibilities and care enough to design the system in such a way to minimize the risk (read: make abusing it as difficult/unreliable as possible, which both deters and mitigates abuse). 
---
The other important thing to note is that Blizzard gave their word that layering would continue no later than the end of phase 1, if not sooner. Thus the advantage people could gain from abusing it are confined to only a small part (albeit probably the most pivotal part for the economy) of the life of the game. I'm not saying that no one is going to go to great lengths to abuse it during that time, but I'm sure that fact alone will deter some people from heavily abusing it if they don't think the effort is worth the temporary benefit.

&gt;Find a guild that raids once a weekend
---
Hi. My fellow guildies with wives, kids, homes, and careers all plan to drink beer and raid every Friday or Saturday night.
---
I‚Äôm sure there will be plenty of guilds like us on your server that you roll. Don‚Äôt worry.
---
A full group of 20s would probably struggle quite a bit. I personally consider SFK a 22-23 minimum; you could probably carry a single level 20 through it as long as its not the tank.
---
By these calculations I'm going to be lvl 60 right about before Christmas, playing 20 hours a week. Realistically later. I'm not going to be efficient, I can feel it.
---
&gt;Is warrior leveling really THAT bad? I know it's the second slowest class to level
---
Warrior is THE slowest to level. A lot of downtime, lots of bandages and eatting. You're as good as your gear, so basically you're not good at the start. They are fun even while leveling imo, they're absolute beasts in PvP and PvE, often people call them the best class in WoW because when they do hit 60 they can Tank, Top DPS charts, and destroy faces in PvP. 
---
&gt;How balanced are the different talent specs?
---
They aren't very balanced at all. Hybrids are more or less all healers. Some different specs work for PvP, like Arms, Shadow, Elemental, etc. But a hardcore raid definitely isn't bringing an Elemental Shaman or  Boomkin.
---
&gt;How the heck do you make up an original name?
---
I smashed my keyboard and just put vowels between the strings of consonants that appeared until I found something I liked.

not gonna lie the orgrimmar part was pretty enjoyable, I expected the whole thing to be far worse

I love reading this. I'm 30 and planning a career switch. The decision is scary but it's good to know I'm not alone.
---
Might be neat to see, but I plan on maxing everything out.
---
Yea, nostalgia, but what I want more than anything is to play Classic with today's tech.
---
This is total copy pasta at this point, and basically everyone is complaining about the streamers everywhere.
---
But whatever.
---
yeah that's exactly the kinda thing I wish I could test but I'm not in the beta so I hope someone does.
---
Psure you get shield block at lvl 16. Tips doesn‚Äôt even have it bound. It‚Äôs kinda critical when tanking hard hitting mobs like this so you don‚Äôt get crit and two shot like Tips did here. 
---
He has a lot to learn. Communication, abilities, not being suicidal, etc. It‚Äôs really sad so many Warriors new to Vanilla are going to look to this guy for feedback. 
---
Source: Leveled a Warrior to 60, primarily tanked, raided in a competent guild, have MC/BWL/AQ/Naxx experience.
---
There's literally no point of speed running, you will not outgear people by phase 2 anyway.
---
OKay... this just gave me a boner
---
They should eventually release it in classic...every race should have race specific gear for their class at some point imo
---
You Eurocucks really can‚Äôt help hating on the US, can you?

If that person has two jobs as a burger flipper, then sure, they can‚Äôt afford a decent car. But no one is stopping them from getting a good job. It‚Äôs their own fault, not the country‚Äôs.

There are literally millions of Americans with a single job and have a car. I don‚Äôt know why you think the US is a third world shithole.
---
And that's not what vanilla was like.
---
The increased melee range in vanilla was almost imperceptible. Many 60s didn't even know it existed.
---
I don't agree that normal was 5 yards and Tauren added 2. Maybe a quarter to a half, 1 full yard stretching it. And might not have been additive for two tauren either

Not catching obvious sarcasm. Pretty sure scorcher got wooshed too but maybe he was joking along

&gt; From TBC (or Wrath) WoW switched to "horizontal plus" mode, where you see more at the sides when the aspect ratio widens.

time to get me a [wraparound 32:9 monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LC49HG90DMNXZA-Curved-49-Inch-Monitor/dp/B072C7TNC5) so I can see those rogues sneaking up behind me
---
I just did a quick google search and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zANeJ_lCSXc) video which also shows a very generous hitbox in TBC. Also several old threads discussing/complaining about the Tauren hitboxes.
---
Edit: [Another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgV6Gk7LfK4)
---
No one is asking you to explain yourself. No one is calling you a bad person, no one is blaming you for anything. It'll be ok. Just be a little more aware next time.
---
I was trying to tell them there was no way Blizzard wasn't updating the graphics as an option. That's just how they are remaking their classic collection for all their IP's.
---
I believe they explained that they have a working old 1.12.1 server that they a referencing off of. If something gets enough reports, they'll just check it against that. I dont think we'll see any type of balancing unless it's truly a bug
---
Can we have this discussion in 4 years please and not now
---
I am assuming that if they want layering out by phase 2 and some servers would have crazy queue times once they were removed, they would open free realm transfers off of that high pop realm to designated lower pop realms before they pull the plug on layering.
---
And yes, they certainly did this in classic. Before paid character transfers were available. (Hence why they were called PAID character transfers, and not just character transfers)
---
((private servers)), amirite?
---
As much as I dislike twitter, and this IS classic, this won't affect anyone who doesn't care about it. All it lets you do is click a little button to submit a screenshot directly to twitter without having to go to the website and find the screenshot there. I don't use it, but I really don't care if others do
---
&gt;Hell, a lot of those people will probably encourage it and act like him.
---
Same goes with most streamers or "e-celebs" and their crowds. They can do shit and get completely away from it. They ninja shit? Who cares? Hundreds/thousands of people will still group with them, they'll face no reprucussions from their actions and will continue their same behavior.
---
It's just one reason to avoid their servers like the bubonic plague. Even if you won't ever group with said streamers, you're still bound to run into their toxic shithole community. 
---
(Btw, I'm not saying ALL streamers are bad, it's just unfortunate that most of them give them all such a bad name.)
---
And now its confirmed that fire mage is the best way to level.
---
For PVE, Troll or UD don't really offer any real benefits other than trolls have more hp regen. (UD cannibalize is meh for a mage, since you can make your own food).  Troll berserking also doesn't work with spells in vanilla, so it's basically a wasted racial.
---
For PVP, yes, UD all the way.  MAges worst enemies are classes that can fear (Priests and Warlocks) so the extra CC break is invaluable.
---
No worries, I'm just glad my comment didn't come off as snarky, a lot of people react that way to my comments.
---
My peronal preference is somewhere in the middle. New water looks weird, but old water just looks "flat", I guess. I'm really glad they gave us the options to tweak graphics to our liking.
---
I refuse.
---
Can we start banning morons like this from the sub?
---
during leveling noone cares. do your best and you'll do fine.
---
You can do the raids. Just raid as a Social rank, it's quite common. You get to experience everything normal raiders do, just not being geared to the hilt.
---
Realistically, outside of hardcore guilds going for server firsts guilds will not be able to form a competent group of 40 raiders for the first couple months.
---
Expect Mc to bet cleared by ultra hardcore guilds in the first 2 weeks, but then there will be a lag for the rest of us moderate and casual players.
---
This seems like a consequence of the new charge mechanic. They're making you go fast instead of transporting you to a fixed point like back in the day.
---
Have they proven it?
---
Played in 04 and just finished my doctorate before a Classic comes out. Sadly will be busy with my internship for most of the first year... enjoy it for me!
---
Wrath baby doesn't even have name on his account.
---
Really? Which patch?
---
That's not how it works.
---
Three. Take it or leave it.
---
Also in TBC, Dranei were the only alliance that could be shamans. Dwarf shamans didn't happen till Cata I think, if they're even in now.
---
All it lets you do is submit a screenshot to twitter from in game when you take a screenshot. Some people do use it, its a pretty small thing tbh. I don't use it, but I don't care if its in Classic or not
---
On the flip side, i'd be the worst bug of them all if I WAS in beta
---
I was unaware of this. That's very interesting, and will could definitely have huge impacts for classic.
---
Where are you getting your values for column B? Those seem way WAY too optimistic.
---
Omg stop with the ad hominem attacks!!! Go read the official communications ya fuckin muppet, I'm not holding your hand through it
---
WotF is good, but massively overrated. You have a ton of tools for PvP as a frost mage, wotf is not a requirement. You will have much more fun playing a race that you enjoy, rather than picking something for the "optimal choice."
---
My son played in 04. He was 4 years old. He is still in school now, though college.
---
Probably a few.  We are all human, by the way.
---
I wouldn't worry about it.  If any bugs make it though, none of them should be game breaking, since those are more obvious.
---
It seems like he's just trying to help. I'm not a tip fanboy or anything, but why hate on that?
---
There were at least two posts in this sub yesterday saying as much as well as someone in one of my discords who has shown screenshots of beta access and account statement showing inactive sub status.
---
Did I hear a niner in there?
---
Classic launch will be 1.12 as well but the content releases are coming in six phases. Honor is a part of Phase 2, BG's (WSG/AV) are Phase 3.
---
Playing with meme specs isnt so great when you're the one trying to carry the meme specs and after 4 hours of wiping because you have 8 people who literally aren't doing anything.
---
Then people start leaving and replacing a bunch of people in vanilla means you either poach from another guild or run a bunch of fresh 60s through old content for a couple of weeks. Then more people leave because they dont want to go back to content they spent months progressing through
---
I don't know how to help you. Sorry :(
---
haha exdee good humour my fellow adults =D
---
Sure it's probably more immediately fun on a pserver right now. All I meant is that both pservers and beta are imminently imploding in weeks/months, so what we're essentially talking about is which ship to go down with and drown on.
---
Damn, thanks for answering before the post got automatically deleted, that's impressive.

&gt;I smashed my keyboard and just put vowels between the strings of consonants that appeared until I found something I liked.
---
That's smart and hilarious. Definitely gonna give that a try.
---
Hah, definitely not bugged. This boss was optional in WC because it was a huge pain in the ass. I remember wiping on that boss often back in the day.
---
Nah not if you're speed leveling, massive waste of time, pretty much all dungeons are
---
The real point is that its a grey area, at best. Some people read it as you need a sub to log into the beta and some people read it as you need a sub to even get an invite. I highly doubt that the live chat people have much more information than the paragraph we are all reading, they are just interpreting it their own way too. I could be wrong on that, I could be wrong about everything, who the hell knows.
---
Why go further than classic... Each expansion introduced changes that in the end ruined wow.
---
&gt; P.s I can't believe Taurens sold this game to you (though I'm glad it did).. like..whew ...my least favorite race next to gnomes. They are so goofy!
---
On the one hand, not liking tauren...
---
**I SAID GOOD DAY, SIR!**
---
On the other hand, you have gnomes at the bottom of the heap. Where they belong.
---
I'm so conflicted.
---
Its for fun dude.. they have literally months to test the game. Also, going from 1-30 is actually testing it
---
Condolences on the contract.
---
wrong. berserking works with spells.
---
It's a beta. Bugs exist.
---
Yeah, you're right. the bugs that get through are probably not a big deal
---
&gt;Dude, now the server is lagging, stop spamming :p
---
ERROR 429 - exponential backoff triggered, please try again in 32s
---
It would be 850xp at launch.
---
We will only know when the product is "officially" released to the public. I personally have "faith" in the engineers working on the Classic project, but I don't have any "faith" in Activision-Blizzard as a whole.
---
no u m8
---
I know a way you can help ;)
---
Streamers get a lot of hate, but one thing that people forget, is that unless they or their followers are toxic, streamers come with a built in community.  This comes with a ton of benefits and you have a large support group already established.
---
It will vary from streamer to streamer, however...
---
Bad troll is unoriginal
---
Never pull the boss if your healer isn't at full mana.
---
Healer never should have been DPS'ing except for a faerie fire at the start.
---
This was a combined fail.
---
Yeah, even the "casual" guilds will clear MC in 2-3 hours this go round. Not the 8 hour marathons I had back in vanilla lmao
---
Okay buddy retard
---
Either they should evade, run back to their normal location or path to the one who is on the island. Them not evading or pathing properly is wide to abuse.
---
What a fucking retard, I never liked that asshat.
---
There is no doubt that many of the people on this sub could do better than these streamers but fat chance we ever get to prove that (before Aug 27 that is).
---
&gt; You hated World PVP or you miss the ability to gank? If you killed someone, they should have been able to move on with their lives and do something else, not sit there and be camped for an hour. 
---
I can see how some people may feel this way I just don't. I love the war in warcraft and part of that for me is terrorizing each other. Obviously this is not for everyone but, I love conflict and, am not concerned with fair. I am perfectly happy to be ganked and camped. As I am happy to gank and camp. The idea I or they could just fly away. Is boring and, kinda takes the "war" out warcraft for me.
---
Looks like you have no idea how business works.
---
Ok, gatekeeper. Maybe you're right, they shouldn't try to seek a bigger and different audience than the ones who already want to play the game.
---
Well I can't see your discord and I've been on this sub for the past 3 days and I haven't seen anything like that. Can I have a link? I don't need identifying information, just some proof.
---
Gamestop hahahaha
---
cant wait to level my tauren through here!
---
They didn't have to have a beta, and why would they advertise to people that already will play the game?
---
Relevant: https://youtu.be/atZEc_ohTtc
---
And  anything "of shadow power"
---
Going to add assuming you won't enjoy it the way you did back then.
---
God, Zuldazar rainstorms are so fucking /comfy/. Everytime it started storming I'd just sit at the top of the pyramid outside where everyone hangs out.
---
if youre entertaining a bunch of kids, yeah?
---
I've read them.
---
You should teach them to use an imp in instances, not to dismiss their pets for a jump skip.  An imp can run through the whole instance and not aggro anything.  The imp gives stamina and does good damage while being the safest pet to use in instances.  If a group needs seduce you pull out succubus for specific pulls.
---
Hey, it's almost like they're having a beta to test for bugs or something...
---
I‚Äôd rather have it than not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sucks no free ship but after all day searching and calling stores they had it up online. Plus they didn‚Äôt limit me to 1 so that‚Äôs a win.
---
Weather was added in patch 1.10  
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weather\_effects](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weather_effects)
---
Those are Joana's speedrun record times.
---
So fairly optimistic.
---
It's not the way I want to be catered to. Like a brainless idiot. A more traditional way would fit classic more then this.
---
I think you're giving him too much credit.
---
Hey man, I'm 31 and I'm a year away from my bachelors degree. It took me twice the amount of time since I have been working while I go to school, but it's worth it if it's for something you want to do. I chose Geology and you'd be surprised how many older students are here.
---
Keep going. The time's going to pass anyway.
---
"I am mad that I did not get a beta invite."
---
We also frequently end up picking up the mess.
---
Says the guy stuck in the layer with 100 people, eh?
---
I‚Äôm not talking about having to purchase the game or accessing it from a sub, I‚Äôm talking about physically installing the client but someone already answered the question!
---
I won‚Äôt do fishing and cooking... I don‚Äôt think. I always went back for that. I‚Äôm thinking mining/ herb. Will try and save my ore and stuff and use the herbalism as my money maker for my mounts, then switch to mining / Eng like I did in vanilla. I was more into pvp than pve. Once I get my mounts and a good amount saved up I can still sell ore for gold. But this is my current thought. Who knows if I‚Äôll end up selling everything and not look back into switching  at max
---
In BC most of the stuff was still the same, WotLK as well, but not as much. Cata changed a shit ton
---
I've seen screenshots of people who did not have an active subscription get invited. They had to pay for a sub to play though.
---
This entire sub is so salty today. It's actually hilarious lol.
---
I dunno about that. as much as i want to agree ive watched Soda and the way he thinks i'd die 60 times more than he does.. he pulls off some pretty crazy moves.. but ASmon is levelling a warrior of course shits gunna be hard. Classic you can only do sooo much before taking a beating.

---
its shocking how bad they actually are. most of those guys have supposedly played private servers and you would expect them to know at least the basics...
---
You know they invited a bunch of non-content creators too, right?  Also, if nobody wanted to watch the beta footage, there wouldn't be anyone streaming it.  The fact that There were over 200k people on Twitch watching classic beta streams yesterday just shows that your opinion is really in the minority.
---
As someone else who didn't get an invite, I'm really happy I'm able to watch the content somewhere.  If there were no streamers (or a market for streamers) then I'd just be wondering about it until the August release.
---
U have to log in to start the rested timer
---
Noone said you can't have a single job and own a car. That would be a ridiculous statement.
---
&gt;But no one is stopping them from getting a good job.
---
Except the literally aren't jobs available, and certainly not with better pay.
---
Also need I remind you that it was *you* who started this whole thing with your inane tax comment. You americucks just can't help hating on Europe, can you?
---
Also, lol "eurocucks", way to show your true MAGA colours. It's been nice knowing you, tiny-dick.
---
Perfect thank you!
---
well wow is more important
---
No...
---
Then you should know that the difference lies in the implementation. Merely having multiple servers would qualify as sharding in your excessively broad definition.
---
Wow!  Just wow!  Awful.
---
I would like to add that when the boss enrages you are supposed to kite him not stand there and get beaten on.  It‚Äôs a rookie mistake with this encounter.  
---
The boss damage is really high and supposed to be unhealable when enraged.
---
I played on a private server that was "blizzlike" with a few exceptions, one of which was 5g respec cost. It was great. I probably spent more gold on respeccing than I would have otherwise because  I was able to do it so frequently.
---
Too bad you missed out on that.
---
IMHO the people in the spotlight are rarely the real experts. The spot light folks are loud and needy/social people like loud. They see their confidence and want to be them. The experts don't care about being watched. They didn't become experts by spending time saying "look at me". 
---
Just look at any huge tech company. Its run by attention craving business people while the real experts chill in the background being the best at what they do. 
---
(Some exceptions may apply)
---
None of them got access to beta. It's a pity for all their hard work and for their communities
---
How are the regen rates? Are the fixed from the demo?
---
Can't believe there were two replies before the post got automatically deleted. Thanks a lot!
---
If you know, I was mostly curious about subtlety being viable. Cause out of quite a few talent trees I've seen none of them did anything with subtlety.
---
Just in case I wanted to play it
---
Way easier to make a spread for most efficient leveling, and then people making there own assumptions on how effectively they will personally be, versus trying to come up with an effeciency medium and then put it in said spread sheet.
---
Yeah people have a lot to learn. They think they know about classic but from watching streamers they're still treating it like retail. Healers didn't start DPSing until mythic plus came out. There's no mana for it.
---
No, as far as i am aware it is just environmental details.
---
How are people getting such high levels in no time at all?
---
Beta been open only a day or so?
---
A good thing would be to make a classic token to discourage people from buying gold from China farmers. Less demand, less supply I guess?
---
Because the only way to bug test is to sit at level 5 doing abilities over and over again /s
---
So much salt in here today.
---
or r/wow even
---
Layering is here forever. It's whole purpose is to create server stability, it will temporarily seem to disappear when server pops stabilize, but will be used every time surges happen - i.e. world events, new phase release, etc. It's not going away because we've decided to tolerate a shit idea from day 1 that we should have vehemently said no to but didn't.
---
He won a cloak and instead of giving to someone (another streamer/party member?) he clipped himself destroying it and sent the clip to them
---
Troll because RIP Totalhalibut
---
They really did test a lot of shit . At least 7 hours each day at least only ability testing lol. Heroes :&gt;
---
Wouldn't that technically be childrenbabies? Followed by babyinfants. Then maybe.. infantfetuses. Fetuseggs? Eggcells? Cellenergy?
---
But you have to spend the gold and therefore have it in BFA
---
Well i got 3 months to setup my battle station. The week of release is a week off work. Already done. Now I just need to stock up on weed, veggies (gotta eat healthy stuff if im to be on classic for long periods of time which is 100% whats gonna happen) and maybe some booze.

I also need to love my GF very much before I disapear never to be found again üòÇ

No it'd be retarded. There's absolutely no reason why that should even be a thing whenever the two versions of the same features can look so different. Like my preferred face for human male looks literally retarded updated. You can't pick a good face/hair/color combo and just assume everyone is going to be seeing it even vaguely the same as you chose. It doesn't work.

Basically what you are asking is if a movie which is still in production will be of lesser quality than a fanmade bootleg.

Please crunch the numbers to show how much time that would save!
---
They need to come out and specifically say "In order to be invited to the beta you need an active subscription or game time". None of this participant ambiguity. It's really not hard for them to clear this up once and for all.
---
I should say that this post pretty much confirms that you do need to be subbed. I still think the post was ambiguous in the first place.
---
You could go to the forums and try to post the bugs there.  Or reach out to a streamer to try and get them to submit the bug.  or post in the mega-bug thread that is pinned on this sub.
---
It was a two day beta and, he did it to his friend. To me this sounds funny. However I also know what friends I can and, can't have that kind of fun with. For instance my friend silverbro woulda had this done for sure but, I would never do to my brother. Not because he's family but, because he would take it serious. I wouldn't if it happened to me. I would be calling silverbro a bastard in between laughs.
---
I also love RPG elements like that. Makes the world feel more alive!
---
But the fanmade bootleg is always in production as well. Think about that.
---
honestly
---
I played on RP-PvP. It happened weekly, sometimes daily. 
---
You guys were softies.
---
I dont see why anyone who isnt a streamer or addon creator would even bother anyway. One of the best things about official servers is that we no longer have to worry about our characters getting deleted when the pserver dies. Why spend hours upon hours on a character you know will be removed soon?
---
What? No it isnt..
---
Friendly reminder that vanilla wow is the casual mmo and raiding isnt necessarily the point if the game like in later expansions
---
You can heal pretty well as 30/0/21 shaman, you're really just missing mana tide.
---
My word there's a lot of boring bitches in here that can't take a joke. Yes this was and will be annoying but if you don't do shit to annoy your friends I feel bad for you, because your friendships must be awful
---
You do realise you are allowed to sit and eat on top of benefitting from spirit right? Ya dingus.
---
I was just letting you know why some people might actually WANT such a thing, since you seemed unable to even fathom it.
---
Smarten up.
---
I played WoW vanilla beta, and every expansion ever since. I went back to school and finished end of last year, because I never got my degree when I should have. So I guess maybe I'm a person OP is talking about, or not. I can't tell.
---
**You** already know that you want to play the game. Blizzard just wants to increase the audience for classic. Let's be honest, what would WoW be without brainless idiots? ;)
---
But we didn‚Äôt have flying in Azeroth till Cata. I understand no weather in outlands for that reason, but that doesn‚Äôt explain Azeroth.
---
Awesome! good to see they're aware of it. Thank you
---
31-point sub might not be completely optimal, but snagging Preparation was almost mandatory in pvp.
---
You shouldn't dismiss graphics as if they have no impact however.
---
OSRS to RS3 is a great example. There are just some things that directly affect the quality of the game that are reliant on graphics. Things like clarity, story telling, detail, atmosphere, immersion, functionality, visibility, ect, are all affected by graphics, however minute the effect is.
---
Obviously good graphics  are not all there is to a game, but you shouldn't act as if dwarf fortress wouldn't be better with a graphics upgrade.
---
honestly i dont even play private servers because the spawn rate is wayyy too damn high. Caves are impossible.
---
pretty sure an excellent feral druid would be able to out-dps an average combat rogue given equivalent gear. It depends on the player too. A complete ban on certain classes isn't necessarily the way to go.
---
Dungeons only START to get difficult around zul'farrak
---
Sorry, mate, I see your point and we're really not trying to be toxic shits here, but it's really, _really_ simple.
---
Was the transmog system implemented in Vanilla? No? No.
---
Then it has no right of being implemented to Classic. It's simple, really.
---
Also, transmog ruins the point of the visual factor of your character's progression. It undermines the factor of other people recognising badass gear.

He admits he was wrong in a pinned comment
---
Yes - you can definitely be competitive in Classic WoW... extremely quickly even I‚Äôd say if you have previous MMO experience, which it sounds like you do.  Classic is a pretty straight forward simple game.  Some classes literally spam 1 button as their top DPS rotation for example.  PvP is typically a bit more involved, but it‚Äôs far from rocket science.
---
Ok hang on, this is actually frickin cool. Do we really wanna report this? Lol
---
I am talking about streamers/people in the beta right now. They are mostly practicing leveling routes. Most leveling routes do not have you go to duskwood before levl 29
---
One change I hope stays! :D
---
Oh that makes sense, thanks again!
---
I played in 04, I was 5 and I sat on my dad's lap and auto attacked plain striders
---
Lol - 150% is almost mount speed, and it's faster than travel form. You're saying travel form should not escape mobs?
---
Yeah I saw that too.  News flash for beta testers from retail - there was no built in quest help in Vanilla!  The Questhelper addon was your savior.
---
deleting an item while messing around on a beta while in a group of streamers is probably the worst transgression in human history if you ask me.
---
Sounds cool. Don't forget to draw weird shit on their faces while they sleep and you all giggle like little dainty schoolgirls. #whiteguystuff
---
Thank you for pointing out the kind of toxic attitude in talking about.
---
You mean the game has lots of bugs 3.5 months before release. UH HUH. I hope they establish some sort of system to start testing this thing soon...
---
I had no idea what I was doing haha. Pretty sure I only got to lvl 36 before BC cause I didn‚Äôt know how to do a lot of the quest so I just killed things.
---
Today I came up with the dream of an Orc Hunter named Roguesbane. Pretty into it :p
---
Will there still be private servers after classic?  Sure.  Will they be better now, that we have classic as a reference?  Absolutely.
---
But wasn't the POINT of wanting classic, that we wanted an official legacy server by blizzard?
---
They did it before.
---
i was watching soda the first time and was suprised by the amount of avoidable deaths. his healing in wc was also pretty sketchy. i thought this guy had experience.
---
tuned off asmonoob when he said he wants to level fury dualwielding.
---
Yea but one is just leveling to 30
---
One I have a 60 where i can dump on dudes in t3 in t1 because I have a massive bank
---
If you're choosing one over the other as just a regular guy idk what you're doing.
---
Beyond like the engineering items I don't care. I'm a paladin player. Healing ain't gonna change

If you like classic and already are active on a p server...WHy woudl you?

That is a name I haven't heard in a long time. Seems they still operate too.

If I remember correctly, when I first moved from the States, I could select between US and EU servers, but I tended to just stick with US, as the few friends I had still playing WoW were in the US (that‚Äôs now just one). But again, this would have been around 2007, so I don‚Äôt know if they changed their policy. I can definitely browse EU/Latin America/Brazil servers now, but I‚Äôve never bothered joining anything other than the US one. Think I moved over to Sargeras from the initial one in like 2005 cuz a friend was on it.
---
Bear in mind, I‚Äôd be surprised if I‚Äôve put more than 15 hours into WoW since 2009 - hence why I‚Äôm keen on Classic. The last expansion I bought was WotLK, and that‚Äôs where my very first character - started at the game‚Äôs release - still resides at level 75. =P I was a solo player almost exclusively and that‚Äôs as far as I levelled before moving on. When I log into current WoW, I don‚Äôt know what end is up!
---
So, yeah, that‚Äôs really interesting! Strange to have had a slightly different experience with the whole process.
---
Tips never played vanilla back in the day and if he did he was somehow worse at the game then which is insane
---
IIRC it was the second biggest feature of its patch, alongside selfie cam. WoD was an.. interesting time.
---
An *authentic* official legacy server. The word authentic was used numerous times in their advertising.
---
I understand that. But it's really just sharding but internal to a single server. Thus it carries over many of the problems and exploits that come along with sharding.
---
Looking forward to ganking carebear shits like you
---
Stafff told me that you needed a sub to play the beta, but could still be picked for it??? Do some of them not know what they are doing, or is this for real?
---
I legit dropped out of school because of WoW, yes I still finished school, but I did it in outreach program and got my diploma, but Vanilla WoW was everything to me. 30 now, sadly when it releases in August I'll be away PepeHands
---
I mean... you can? But I havent hear of anyone even trying because why would you?
---
Their efforts are commendable but what worries me are potential issues with mechanics that aren't well documented. If those kind of things have issues then it will go completely unnoticed, which is why I'm still disappointed that they're recreating the game piece by piece instead of just redeploying a patched iteration of the original product.
---
With raid gear. Casuals will be way behind the curve on that.
---
Ah, memories.
---
&gt; In the original World of Warcraft, the level 60 Naxxramas raid was essentially the last major content update for the game before The Burning Crusade arrived. Den of Geek noticed many players on the ClassicWoW subreddit and elsewhere talking about Blizzard creating new level 60 content, including brand new 40-man raids if Classic is a huge success. It would be an opportunity for Blizzard to continue developing the game with its original sensibilities in mind. We were a bit surprised when Blizzard told us it's a real possibility and not a crazy pipe dream.
---

I was in 7th grade when i started vanilla. Now I'm in trade school for IT.
---
I think you can totally raid MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 in a 30/0/21 spec with nature's swiftness. The only thing you really miss is mana tide, but you can be in a melee group providing WF and throwing chainheals. I know because I even healed as enhancement in vanilla. All that assuming you're not in the ultra-hardcore guild
---
In my **personal** opinion.  Who the fuck cares?
---
They're racing to 30 and not testing the levels in between.  Who the **FUCK** cares?
---
Every class can do both... that's balance.
---
Just because it is costly to do so does not make it imbalanced.
---
This makes me 10x more scared of tauren knowing im gonna be ally this go around in classic. O.O
---
thank you for the input, i have forgotten how much consecrate drains mana... 
---
i appreciate all of your feedback. I have a lot to consider now... I feel most of peoples plans will go out the window on launch, especially if there is login queues and queues for mob spawns...
---
Blizzard should've just sent it. Went live instead of beta.  Such little issues found thus far, good performance, they missed an opportunity there to have something for people to play during the off-time for game releases in summer.  Though, making people have active accounts for invites, trying to skeeze their fans to get just a little extra cash.  They probably want to ramp up advertising because they're stupidly oldschool and didn't see how Respawn handled it, probably something-something investors, and of course their genuine dislike for their community for making classic happen and not liking their "we know better than you paying customers" failed live expansion.
---
Damn really, spam 1 button? Why are people so hyped about classic? Is it really about the mmo aspect, lvling and pvp?
---
Ahha, I really should have read the info graphic. I'd seen the previous posts figured I didn't need to. Sorry, and thank you!
---
Since you really cant expect a raidspot as a druid just roll warrior if you want to tank its the only real tank in classic
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/TemperedShinyCurryHassanChop
---
Read chat
---
Just keep compiling all of these clips and make sure Blizz is made aware of these bugs either through the beta-game client or on the forums. They'll get around to addressing these things before the final release. (hopefully)
---
You should make a new account called I\_didn't\_play\_WoW\_ever.   
---
The reason I brought up Vanilla was because, well lets see, without vanilla we wouldn't have any of this and oh this is a subreddit for Vanilla/Classic.
---
And yes, required raid professions were locked behind reps in MoP, mainly Gems and Enchantments, but some other rewards were in there.
---
I have **no plans** to race to 60.  World PvP sub 60 is *so much fun.*  Yes, I will be ganking very early on and trying to start massive battles.
---
With the added bonus of kicking you out of the theater in the middle of the picture. And offering give the ending to others around you if they'll only make a *donation*. And periodically cropping over the legit movie with their home-made frames because they don't have the whole film to work with from the start.
---
No thanks!
---
Tips is an idiot.
---
True, doesn't trigger 5 second rule.
---
Sure dude, sounds legit. Keep creating that fake outrage. I'm sure the 1 or 2 other layers will be uncontested btw. Damn you about to ruin the server, oh no!!!!!
---
Who gives a dusty fuck lol.
---
2 rogues, or a rogue and an spriest... mmm fun.
---
I forgot I asked this question, but I figured they were just trolling, as a second later they continued talking about whether or not they liked the fact Shamans are Horde only and Pally's are Alliance only and continued for a bit about the subject. Anyway yup I took the bait I'm a dummy.
---
Edit: spelling
---
My computer in 2005 when I started playing was a potato (Gateway computer with 17" CRT Monitor) compared to the rig I have now. I expect "Classic WoW" will look better than it did then.

Yeah, I don't know. Wanting to still play on private servers after Classic launches would amount to something ACKCHYUALLY resembling brain damage.

But there will be people who do it. Godspeed.

I typically don‚Äôt use many hots on the tank and save those instant casts for side members who tank random damage. Tank is easy enough to keep up with the regular heal.
---
I'm anti-min/maxing and purposely play as unpopular class/specs and try my best to excel at those classes.
---
Min/maxing just makes you the same as everyone else. It's too generic, and I love the rarity of unique builds. Of course, I can't suck or else I'll never get invited, but I've never been at the bottom of the group in dps. That's all that matters.
---
Sure
---
What was toxic about what I said. Ret is a buffing class in raids. Best case scenario you're a nightfall swinger. Which you dont need gear for
---
people die on pservers at lower levels too 
---
all im saying is it looks about the same to me, which is good imo. some mobs might be a little harder but not really like a significant amount
---
Slow mh for harder ability hits and then faster OH for poisons.
---
You don't kick people from vanilla retail dungeons, even if they are bad. It usually takes 30+ minutes to find a replacement depending on class.
---
Good thing streamer privilege still gets them in the beta
---
Lots of people do things like 2 hand tank on private servers all the time. It‚Äôs obnoxious as a healer.
---
The resource argument is silly, if there's layering or sharding it means there's more people playing.  Which means the ratio of resources to players stays the same.
---
I want to say it was around 1.6.0.
---
I found this: " The base chance of 20% is decreased for players under level 30. As a given example, a level 10 player running from a level 10 mob will only have a 7% chance to be dazed. "
---
There is a thread for this
---
eh yeah they're nice in BWL gear tho and that's pretty easy and casual friendly
---
No he didn't u dickwad, stop spreading misinformation
---
I‚Äôm about to be 32 dude and started playing when I was 16. A lot of older players are coming back to enjoy the game. I actually will probably have more playtime now as an adult though since I don‚Äôt do athletics anymore.
---
The Tauren hitbox thing needs to get looked at ASAP
---
I can‚Äôt quest in stranglethorn without thinking of dragonforce or trivium which I had on repeat non stop at the time. I remember I listened to a lot of Zebrahead and Story of the Year quite a bit during vanilla too.
---
I mean, stuff like that definitely is the authentic Barrens chat experience.
---
Mage/priest will be competing with each other for loot.
---
So you live in this weird fantasy bubble. Nice.
---
A day has 24 hours, not 20.
---
What kind of question is this lol
---
I‚Äôd suggest something that isn‚Äôt a clothie for gearing purposes. A shaman would be a good pick imo
---
While you have them on the phone ask about battletoads as well.
---
93 seconds.
---
But that's where my mount money comes from!
---
When you create a new character, it doesn't get placed into the game world until the very first time to log into it. So no, they won't get rested XP.
---
In my first guild we were on a new server that never got populated, I starting playing after a year the game was out, and we are kd barely gather 26 ish people but we managed to reach ragnaros (did not beat him). I moved to another server and there it was like MC and Bwl on the same evening, then wiping at anquiraj for the rest. That is more or less when I quit wow.    
---
I am sure people , some older and more experienced in online games, can wrap mc pretty fast as well , even in blue gear.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm glad I snagged mine so quickly. Statue is fucking lit.
---
How does this look like a lot of work? Half of these are spell batching.
---
Yeah, that part of quests was odd. It is like if you are holding water in your left hand and soda in your right. 
---
You want to hand over the soda and get a cookie. 
---
Quest giver says "No, I will hand you the cookie first, then you hand me the soda. So make room for the cookie, toss that water away"
---
Warrior, because your not completely worthless.
---
That must be a crazy fun week....presumptuous of me to ask for an invite?
---
I am going to out pace her in leveling eventually so I planned on giving her my hand me down cloth gear while helping her catch up.
---
I think about this all the time.  I played the hell out of Vanilla, and didn't even bother with TBC since I was burned out on MMO's by the time it was released.  I remember the "feel" of it, and when I see things in videos or screenshots it sparks my memory a little.  Hell, that was 15 years ago.  I would have to sit down and think about it for a minute before I could even tell you where my apartment was in college at that time.
---
Honestly, I can't remember whether I took a shit yesterday or not.  I mean right now, I think I did, but I can't be totally sure.  I mean, I'm pretty sure I did.
---
Another big negative of inviting mainly streamers. Probably gonna be a lot if false reports like this one because they don‚Äôt want to spend time on actually checking it compared to vanilla
---
&gt; it carries over many of the problems and exploits that come along with sharding
---
Now you're making shit up. You know how I know? Because there's been no official statement. What, exactly, is your point? That in your head blizz already fucked all this up? Sorry you're such a Debbie Downer. Could have just said that at the beginning and I would have given you a hug, Deb.
---
Yeah, life is completely different with kids.
---
Shit, did not realise that. Have a link?
---
thanks for the reply. I honestly don't remember my motivations either. I just assume I must of had 'no choice'. I mean why else would I of bought a new sub(full game) to play as 'EU'. I lost all my toons, achieves, titles, etc by doing so. It was a huge burden that I fought hard to avoid.
---
Why I felt the need to do it, I don't remember now:D
---
It would save you the time of killing approximately 17 mobs.
---
‚Ä¶. So like 4 minutes at level 1-3
---
7 yard melee range and 7 yard hitbox. It was like this until at least through TBC. Gnomes had reduced melee range and hitboxes too but I can't recall the exact numbers. I don't know if this still existed in Wrath but tauren hitboxes were big enough to melee each other straight through the pillars in Nagrand arena.
---
Lol I can‚Äôt comment on his mental health and I did pick the most extreme example I could think of, but I‚Äôve seen the sentiment expressed in many different places by many different people. The guild leader of a hardcore guild on private servers has vowed that they will clear MC in a week based on the fact that they have a secret private server route that allows them to level faster than joanas record. Not impossible, but it‚Äôs seeming to take 48 hours /played to get to 30 currently... I think the differences between beta and private servers are significant and interesting and for me personally they are satisfying. It would have been disappointing if leveling was faster and easier.
---
i dont think its a coincidence a lot of streamers with young audiences act like the people on kids tv shows do. something like ninja is pretty similar to the dude on blues clues or some shitty nickelodeon shows
---
I really hope they get more people involved in the beta fast and expand it well.  I don't care if I never get an invite.  I just want to see bugs found and dealt with so we have a nice sooth launch.
---
The ‚Äúfun‚Äù of Druids is baked into their mobility and flexibility with spells and forms.
---
If you want to do serious tanking or damage, go warrior.
---
tbh I wouldnt even go wc at 19 if i wanted a full run
---
like I usually wait for like 20-21 especially as a melee
---
We‚Äôre not worried about layering anymore. The issue of today is that apparently people didn‚Äôt realize betas have bugs.
---
Because why form your own opinions whenever you can just circle jerk?
---
Damn, this brings back feelings. 
---
Kamahl on Spinebreaker (Druid), heyo Req!
---
Sheeeet. fixed column `E`, date is still right.
---
1) Blizz doesn't care. They don't appear to be willing to scale anything up. Their assumption is that even in big BGs the groups are separated (it's a stupid assumption but that's just what it is)
---
2) The demand is there in classic. So much more than in retail.
---
3) Why bring code into the discussion. It's got pretty much nothing to do with it. It's all about CPU power - or more precise - cores+speed for any given shard.
---
4) CPU throttling. it happens on your PC, too. If one programm is retarded and completely burns one core the whole system get's slow.
---
yes, very rekt as you can see
---
Not necessarily - my point is that there are exploits there that are the same problems that we would see if Sharding is present. They need to do something to mitigate these exploits.
---
This is what happens when Cata babies test Vanilla.
---
You're me, minus kids and a bit younger. used to 'no life' the game Raiding and PVPing to rank 14.  Now I'm looking to do what I can as time permits.
---
Feral tanks with MCP actually have the highest threat per second compared to all tanks. People have tanked all through Nax as feral druids.
---
24, 2 kids, wife and career. Going to be much different this go around, but instead of no lifing, being that invested into the game, I think I'll be able to enjoy it differently. Find a semi casual guild that likes to have fun while progressing, drink on raid nights, etc.
---
Mage is probably the worst duo leveling class unless you're playing with another mage to pull off some crazy aoe grinding
---
It's fixed flat amount but nowhere near 500hp at this level, so yeah it's a bug https://web.archive.org/web/20060622173223/http://www.thottbot.com/?sp=7328
---
That's interesting, if they just directly used 1.12 spell database they would not get this wrong.... so what's going on?
---
After about level 15 maybe, all the items you start to pick up bind to your character when you equip them, so you won‚Äôt be able to give them to her unfortunately
---
not even sure what that means. I enjoy world pvp if thats what you are trying to say. It's obvious you don't. Theres nothing wrong with that but, I am hardly in a bubble. There millions just like me. How do you think pvp servers got so popular in classic?
---
Its cool mate, all those comments are hidden anyway because people downvoted them into obivion, probably since it was off topic and as you said, thats how reddit works.
---
They're doing a stress test next week, so there's a chance that you could get in for that since they'll want a lot of people. (presumably)
---
93.333 repeating, of course.
---
I love the model for vaquisher's sword, it's probably my favorite non epic weapon, and the only one I'll actively go after while leveling, I also tend to keep it for a lot longer than I should too.
---
I'm pretty sure I've healed better while fucking DC'd or desynced. Yknow when all the action pauses and then catches up in a minute or so. Don't happen too much anymore, but could still cast and act during the pause.
---
Yeah I know. That's why I know it's a terrible idea, I've seen the consequences of it.
---
Deathwing blew up stonewrought dam and it flooded the entire area
---
There were a few EU people invited.  I don't follow any big names, but I am pretty sure EU and NA share beta servers.
---
Tips is terrible. No fucking way he played vanilla, 80% of everything he says is just wrong...
---
no alternative item for now, it would require a lot of work to do this (to gather alternative for every thing)
---
You have been playing wow since 2004 and havent played horde yet?
---
I'll be a hunter and I tried it on retail as a Demon Hunter. I must say gnome rogues are... an annoyance. If I pick a troll and a gnome runs up on me I'll probably get raped before I learn to adjust as. it's honestly hard to see and keep track of the little fucker. I'll make due though, I've been waiting for this since VR was announced.
---
Just search for what to play in search bar and limit results to this sub
---
Did he really get $881.10 thrown at him by a bunch of fanboys, just for watching him play the Classic beta?
---
#wtf
---
lol. pve frost mage is a horrible spec for pvp.
---
i guess .. to me :)
---
The most notable PvP groups in general, at least on our end (Horde) were the groups that people like Ghellscream / Veralier ran with folks like myself (Kamahl, DA / DoV), Tactics (DA), Reign (DoV), Exitwoundz, Blitzkrieg (DA), Tarpit (DA), Bravery (DoV / DA), Gudz (DA) etc. 
---
I'm so glad I found this thread.
---
I'd love one example. Several replied about beta invites in the other thread, all NA based. The one EU person confirmed their account was actually a US account.
---
I've not seen anyone confirm they had an 'EU' sub and received an invite.
---
yeah but thats classic IMO. 
---
its a totally different game. Fuck i kinda enjoy them being noobs! since thats what everyone was back then ,
---
Ian literally said himself it's not about player feedback since the game is not going to be changed and it is what it is.
---
Thought as much, no worries. It's more for things that are not likely to drop or are expensive BoEs (again off hand dagger for rogue) than everything, because that would definitely be a lot of work.
---
Deep Ocean, Vast Sea has returned to bring misery upon us all.
---
Many were yeah, lead by Althor I believe?
---
Am I remembering incorrectly but didn‚Äôt we have a feature at one point that allowed you to order Pizza Hut from ingame. For some reason I am remembering this.
---
Anyone on beta please report this and help them to achieve authenticity!
---
thanks to those who do :)
---
Hello stranger, creator here, thank you for advertising !
---
How do you know
---
Since the damage component of roots is a dot, if you follow dot logic for other spells roots should not cancel food/drink. I could be wrong though.
---
I ran with DoV for quite a while during Vanilla, what was your character?
---
Classic will be far closer to vanilla than pservers at launch. Only after classic has been out a while and things can be datamined, logs can be crosschecked, and then some will pservers come close to vanilla.
---
What you should really be asking yourself is why do you think pservers will be closer to actual vanilla than classic?
---
Blizzard has the data, the hard data. They have already disproven a few things that pserver enthusiasts claim to be ‚Äúthe way it was.‚Äù So why would their product not be closer to the original than some reverse engineered fan made money grab?
---
Richard, who's your favorite Little Rascal?   
---
Alfalfa?   
---
Or is it Spanky?   
---
^^^sinner
---
In some ways, 2 mages would be kind of cool. Having 2 polys and 2 frost novas during leveling could be very useful in a more dangerous world with a new player. Plus imagine how disjointed it will be if only you have teleport while your gf has to run to the city. That will break up your flow. Although frost is the superior spec for leveling, it might be fun if one of you were fire spec.
---
All this is non-efficient points, but might be more fun if fun is your thing.
---
I remember less things then I would have liked. There was this topic about where you dinged 60, and I honestly can't remember and it pisses me off haha.
---
So they'd just get an email at some point saying they got in? Or does the game just show up on your client? I thought I read the announcment but my memory is failin gme
---
How do you get lost in WC? Very fucking easily.
---
Are you talking about Guzu? He's Danish and he's in the Beta atm.
---
oshit is this _the_ Pherr?
---
Kamahl here, wsup buddy.
---
Gotta side with Tralls on this one. You don't get to be number 1 at everything unless you are willing to pay the troll toll. And yes pve+pvp is basically everything. What else is there pv? One of the crappy things about retail is everyone running around in the most imba spec for what they are doing.
---
What school? I played in 2005. My brother stole my account and bought me a new one. He ended up getting to KT and 3 pieces of T3 when it was current. I never made it further than MC/Aq20 clears. I‚Äôm in college now, 28 this year. So I was around 13 when I first started playing. Depending on what ‚Äúschool‚Äù you‚Äôre going off of I‚Äôm still in school. Not everyone goes in at 18 or finishes before 22ish.
---
A good raid leader knows always what every single person have to to in the raid. dictating things and even replace not skilled players.
---
Warrior tank is really fun. For me, collecting the equipment to gear out a warrior tank is a blast. You get to find a cool one hander and a shield and a full suit of plate.
---
Legion legacy realms! Get hyped!
---
Gimme a main tank and good healers....I don‚Äôt give a fuck what everyone else does, just please show up.
---
On that note, I'm still waiting for global warming to afflict Chicago.

---
Mechanically, sure, there's no reason most of those^1 shouldn't be a thing, but that's one of my favorite aspects of Vanilla/Classic WoW: the racial restrictions often have as much to do with flavor as with mechanics.
---
There are no tauren priests because their culture doesn't have an element of dualistic morality that facilitates the existence of a priesthood. Instead they're animistic and all about the balance of nature; one thing flows naturally into another until the cycle completes and begins anew.
---
Humans, meanwhile, are *all about* that moral dualism and completely lack the sense of/belief in natural animism that bolsters shamanism and druidism being a thing. Which is why they have paladins and priests but no hunters (let alone druids), as that requires a deeper connection to nature than their culture generally fosters.
---
As far as trolls (and orcs) having shamans but not druids... Let's be frank: tauren druids are kinda' shaky, lore-wise; they were a quick patch job to give the Horde a druid race as well, and it shows, both in the lore and the animal form models. I mean, I love 'em, but I'm not gonna' lie to myself about it.
---
I agree with you about gnome warriors, though. Much as I enjoy the absurdity of a pint-sized, full plate berserker, it doesn't really fit with the characterization of the race. Alas, nothing to be done about it at this point.
---
^1 ^Excepting ^undead ^hunters. ^The ^whole ^point ^of ^the ^class ^is ^it's ^strong ^connection ^to ^nature, ^whereas ^Forsaken ^characters ^are ^fundamentally ^unnatural ^beings.

I always used an addon to adjust my viewport and fow to be higher perspective of the character.

Honestly I am grateful because it means I can work hard now, request time off work, and no life for a few weeks worry free that I am screwing up my adult life by doing so.

Fucking lopsided tube TVs.

This. I took a few classes when I was 18, took a few years off, went back, took a few years off, just finished a few classes this spring. I‚Äôm 27 now. Played in 2005 when I was 13.
---
Those three are doing an absolutely outstanding job trying to find actually game-changing bugs and I commend them for it. 
---
Boons to this community.
---
Its been 15 years, thats why I wrote that I might be wrong. It indeed was a flat amount.
---
iirc, things like PPM were added later in the game.  So, during Vanilla/Classic time frame, it was just a flat percent chance to proc.  This meant you could get some bs where you don't get procs for long stretches and other times where you get back to back procs.

Well played man. Keep grinding.

Seems like private servers wasn't that close to the real thing after all ehh?! :-D 
---
Let's see how good druids will end up being.
---
It's been one day dude, give it time and I'm sure there will be plenty of bugs discovered that will need to be fixed.
---
I donno about boomys but most hybrid dps gear is completely independent and doesn‚Äôt even come from raids for the most part. Until aq 40 when hybrid dps gear comes in the form of t2.5.
---
I know two other swedes playing the beta, but I doubt they were randomly selected.
---
That magical blue smoke is just the electrical fairies escaping their prisons.
---
&gt;Thank you for playing the WoW Classic Beta!
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Because reporting a boss whose only mechanic always was "deal a lot of damage" for dealing a lot of damage is really bad. Someone has to go check it out on the reference build at Blizzard now, wasting their time because Tips is a baby
---
The logistics alone are baffling, where fools gonna sleep? OP do you have a big house?
---
Back in vanilla/bc time I was practicing speed leveling and my fastest time was 2h 15 minutes on a troll rogue from 1-10. Which is why I was asking if he was trying to speed level or if the leveling is faster in classic inadvertently. But I assume considering his /played was 8 seconds after leveling that he was attempting to level fast.
---
So two example of content creators. Maybe they also had US subs..or maybe they are special.
---
I'd love to hear of random joe blow who got an invite from EU --- As it seems plenty of NA folks did :)
---
I need pics.  For science.
---
What about MrGM, I think he has an EU account. He used the EU server tag on his livestream this morning.
---
Like this? https://i.redd.it/0s5t263kerx21.jpg
---
Omg streamers waaaaaaaah
---
I had the exact same though.
---
Rather telling, I think.
---
This is brilliant. Just brilliant. I have a hard time naming my toons and I love this.
---
The Earth Mother smiles upon you!
---
There are a couple that I don't mind, but for the most part they can get obnoxious.
---
I don't get the hate though... I feel like people need to get over themselves and stop feeling like anyone cares about their nerd rage.
---
Just don't watch them. Works for me and I manage to not spew streamer hate on reddit ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 
---
Makes me feel like these people secretly watch streamers CONSTANTLY.
---
Lol bro, most of this sub starts foaming at the mouth at the mere mention of streamers/youtubers, I sincerely doubt this will ever happen
---
If it was an Alliance town, it got fucked in Cataclysm. No bias by the way.
---
I have a good cure to your problem, just don‚Äôt roll Alliance.
---
No ret paladins to worry about!
---
I actually completely agree with you. I'd probably level a Rogue if I could level as subtlety.
---
It's so much more fun.
---
We're a gaming subreddit, we were fucked from the start.
---
Nothing can stop the slow, steady decay of this sub into /r/wow short of new rules and enforcement.
---
My anniversary is on the 28th.... This... This is going to be challenging.
---
Fuckin yikes for me dawg
---
Maybe they disabled it so people can't grief quest givers in the beta.
---
I loosely remember in vanilla on my druid (my like 6th alt at the time) knew quests by heart at that point... i got to lvl 30 in like 28 hours played.. i am sure some well rested was involved
---
It's not clips of streamers, its mouth breathers wishing they were streamers, but just hating on them
---
Even though retail WoW has tokens and OSRS has "bonds" (which are essentially the same thing), black market gold prices are still considerably lower than the cost of these and this is always going to be the case. Sure, it helps, but there's always going to be a competitive black market.
---
No one I know in real life got an invite yet.
---
Perhaps content creators got them, but not seen an 'average person' in EU who got one. Where as lots replied in the other thread from NA that got one.
---
At the moment feels like EU was only content creators and NA was a mix.
---
On broken private servers. You need to accept reality of vanilla, real vanilla or continue to hope. I completed Naxx in retail vanilla, we used a Tauren Warrior from Onyxia to Kel'Thuzad because Tauren Warrior was the most min-maxxed tank in the game. You need shield wall to complete most of the bosses, even early in the game, among countless other things warriors are better at. 
---
Threat is not really a massive issue, it just takes a little practice for players to know their limits.
---
Even things that should work correctly out of the box from database are not working correctly. Paladin resurrection spell has the data that it resurrects with 65 health (at rank 1) yet it resurrects with full health (retail behavior).
---
Christ you guys are salty
---
Its a beta. He's goofing around with his friends. It's level 20 content. You guys just look for any excuese to hate tips because he's more involved in the community than you'll ever be
---
I demand an invite
---
Simple things like grind spots no longer being as viable will have a significant impact on leveling speeds. More variety in monster stats meaning it is harder to cherry pick the best mobs to grind on(because they were missing something that balanced them against other mobs) so on and so forth.
---
Raiding is peeeerfect for us 35+. Meet up with 39 other ppl that are adults and have fixed their schedule and now got 3-4hours free in the evening. Much better time spent compared to being a casual and trying to pug stratholme only to have your tank leave halfway in. 
---
Lvling though... that will take some time so better to just enjoy it. 
---
See you in Azeroth

Apparently the guy he's talking to is EU.  Though, I don't know if it's like what you said, where he just has an NA account
---
Apologize.
---
Till now I only know from content creators. But this forum isn‚Äôt the best source to find the normal guy from EU. Maybe in wow forums?
---
I believe Warriors (human at least) get a green sword from their level 10 quest which is quite nice.
---
Hating Tips. So hot right now.
---
The more people from private servers gets invite, the less bugs ll be there, since those are the one, who actually stayed in touch with vanilla wow for all these years and know stuff much better than any other retail-only guy. I honestly dont understand, what is blizzard doing with inviting random retail boys. Hopefully, lots of people among invited players have played vanilla lately
---
fuck streamers
---
[Yes, here‚Äôs the video ](https://youtu.be/Wi-7oKvOM4c)
---
lol no, this has nothing to do with healing hybrids. rogues mages and warriors also can't really pvp in their raidspec.
---
Give me an update if you find someone :D
---
My man.
---
Does anyone have any video of downpour in Lorderan areas?  It was HEAVY there.
---
I used to dual box alt tabbing to a healer.  You basically just accept the healer is only healing and won't be playing to it's full potential, it worked best leveling warlock and priest because life tap made downtime non-existent.
---
I'm considering leveling my rogue this way but idk if it's worth the effort to tab over and deal with quest looting and turn ins.
---
Why do you feel the need to say what people can and can't play? Why not just present the information and let the player decide what is fun?
---
Aside from this omission, really good job on the site. Thanks for making it.
---
What else are we going to do? Talk about what comes after Naxx for the 1000th time?
---
Can we confirm that works on classic client?
---
there are currently a bunch of german streamers playing it:  Kimuh, Stevinho, JohnnyCDerp
---
I'm trying to convince the people I'm playing with to go Horde this time (we all played Alliance during Vanilla). Hopefully I'll succeed because I really want to play a Shaman this time.
---
Yeah us normal people can keep hope until someone else gets the invite:)
---
Classic graphics + old talent trees = ultimate nostalgia
---
Never played Alliance, might go ally just so all the quests and story is new
---
Why do people watch streams with webcams? I can't stand having a neckbeard box on my screen.
---
There is flawed logic here though. Off specs can still be EXTREMELY helpful when you get into the thick of things. DPS druids can still step back for a second, invigorate, heal, and battle rev. Ret Paladins can heal, provide buffs, etc.
---
I‚Äôm not saying fill your raid with tons of those, but they all provide something for your raid. They might not do the most dps or heal the most, but that being a jack of both trades has definitely saved my raiding group plenty of times.
---
Content creators..no regular people reporting yet:(
---
Your limb broke, bro. Dat shit broke homie. Ayy sometimes you get it, sometimes you get got.
---
What level are these guys? Sure you can start doing WC and get through some bosses and mobs at level 18, but you really should be 21. Especially the tank.
---
People want to play the game they remember from 10 years ago.
---
What's so hard for morons like you to understand after being told hundreds of times already?
---
45 here. Not so quick anymore. Looks like PvE server for me.
---
When you put a checkmark in the box, it automatically adds a timestamp, and the rows are grouped so as I add they'll sort by date/time completed. By no means is this done, and many are long term goals, but I still think this could be a good way to keep track of my adventure.
---
Boss in WC hits too hard kappa
---
&gt; in retail given you can have 40 characters harvest each node 40 times
---
Node tap caps out at 10.
---
It could also be people didn't understand how to itemize druids in vanilla. Who knew Warden Staff and Manuel Crowd Pummler were BIS weapons throughout the game.
---
I don't post for upvotes and thanks for learning how reddit works.
---
It‚Äôs definitely got a lot to do with the mmo and community aspect.  World PvP is also a completely different spin on PvP that mostly died  after the first expansion was released. 
---
Not sure if you‚Äôve ever played other old school MMO‚Äôs like Classic EQ or FF XI, but the allure is similar in those games.  They, along with Classic WoW, just have a certain soul to them that current MMO‚Äôs (including retail WoW) are completely missing.  It actually feels like a real world complete with flaws, imbalances, and unfairness.  Everything about the current MMO landscape is so homogenized and predictable that they feel like the fake artificial worlds that they are. 
---
I‚Äôm actually in the same boat as you from a competitive side of things.  I like topping DPS meters and pwning nubs in PvP.  But I dunno, there‚Äôs just something about Classic WoW that I love.  Guess you just have to play it to understand.
---
childish way I type? lol theres absolutely nothing childish about the way I type. Its called the internet dumb fuck. People type like that all the time. Based on this comment I can tell you're a dumb shit.
---
The system is working already :-)
---
What polygons have been changed? As long as the shitty HD models aren't in, I'm happy.
---
I started playing 1/22/2006, I had just turned 10 y/o! Saw the game on X Play and I begged my mom for it haha, 23 y/o now looking forward to playing it again.
---
I think the combat text you're remembering might be SCT? Which was an addon.
---
(SCT = scrolling combat text)
---
So what you guys think is going to happen after Naxx?  Will they re-release BC &amp; WotLK?  Would you guys be okay with them adding new content to classic?
---
Was expecting a link to [The Brothers Tauren] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSEyKIUqGn0).
---
This was not that, but I'm still not disappointed.
---
^And [^part ^two] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7X1apSgGFo), ^for ^those ^interested.
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla, switched to Horde for BC onwards, but I'll be going back to Alliance for Classic.
---
&gt; That's interesting, if they just directly used 1.12 spell database they would not get this wrong.... so what's going on?
---
Even tho the correct data has been imported that does not mean that the engine interprets it correctly. This is most likely a bug related to that.
---
u didnt asked for non content creaters tho
---
Beta just started yesterday and no one has seen any gameplay footage since the demo in November. Of course we‚Äôre interested. 
---
I think you may be overreacting a bit early. It will die down.
---
i never said you shouldn't play what you want, i just don't have the data to do them, as said in the credits part of the website and everywhere i speak about it, data are from the most famous spreedsheet and i help the creator to correct the data as much as i can with all the feedback i got, but if he doesn't want to create them, it's not my fault
---
You're absolutely correct, but if you want to clear a dungeon with relative ease, you should be around level 21 IMO. There's no harm in being 18-19. but your chances of wiping are gonna be higher.
---
Especially UBRS. Ony key, bwl flag, and a shit load of pre raid BIS for all classes.
---
Sure if you're being pedantic, but you wouldn't use it in this case. 
---
Going from 4 to 40 hours yes. Going from 9 to 10 hours no. Its not a hard line but most people would not call a less than 50% increase an order of magnitude.
---
No, even if it did work that way the area you first spawn in at isn‚Äôt even a rested area
---
&gt; Why bring code into the discussion. It's got pretty much nothing to do with it. It's all about CPU power
---
bro do you even MMO?
---
CPU power requirements grow exponentially. it means problem at some point is not fixable. at some point they sacrificed scale for smoother interactions at low numbers (just shard them lol - and even that doesnt work properly), and have been battling with that problem since. there is no indication that problem is solved for classic.
---
https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=6185
---
It's just a huge sign of disrespect. You only use low level items for a bit anyway so it being a beta doesn't really matter in terms of "it's onlaaaui temporaaary looooool"
---
yeah lol fuck this guy. let me name 3 battle royals and thats it thats all the games we have theyre all bad.
---
you are wrong, yes.
---
Re read my post. I didn‚Äôt diminish anything. You clearly like to troll and argue with people on the internet for whatever reason. I‚Äôm merely saying that people who do the whole number crunch/long grind to theory craft often have their work stolen and put on YouTube to receive very little to no credit while a ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù takes the fame. That is all. Please reread the post as you seem to have completely missed that part in parenthesis. There was no tone, as this is a written format and I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äú... I yelled!‚Äù At the end of my typing. Nor did I use caps. I did however, calmly type that he researches other people‚Äôs research.
---
Correct, but after folks pointed them out. I realized at best it seems they got invites but no normal eu user has claimed they did :)
---
Honestly warrior is very fun, so much stuff to do while tanking, different weapons, more upgrades you can possibly get from dungeons, you can even try 2H or DW tanking if you overgear the dungeon (or raid).
---
Druid as a tank is pretty straight forward and less gear dependant. Druid in the open world is fun though.
---
If you're talking about just raids, then warrior will be able to tank more and have more itemization choices too. You can also get into fury-tanking or dual-wield later on. Druids get very few upgrades from the first raids. Their pre-raid gear is pretty strong though.
---
Druid offtank is indeed viable and pretty strong at it's niche. It's got huge TPS and will make your warriors soak gear faster, but you'll need to convince a guild just so you can offtank some bosses. Honestly warrior is the safe choice.
---
I Remember when classic WOW was life.
---
10 Hours after school glued to the screen to wipe on Baron G 5 times and then go bed with 0 homework done. Ah those were the days.
---
If it makes you feel better, I finished my PhD a couple of years ago and almost immediately decided to switch careers. So now I'm 36 and back in school. It's big, but you can do it.
---
Ahh, good ol' Herod's gear from SC
---
You lost me at ground clutter. It could affect gameplay.
---
But I'm technically correct, the best kind of correct.
---
This is the one thing I wish would get added (I know it‚Äôs impossible). It would make choosing a class so much easier for me. I don‚Äôt have the time to farm for gold just to be able to respec twice a week. There are some things I think shouldn‚Äôt be touched, but adding obvious QoL improvements that didn‚Äôt interfere with the social aspect like the LFR did should be added IN MY OPINION.
---
&gt; Tips might the worst player playing this beta right now
---
Hahaha
---
Will be 33 by the time it comes out. Active retail player here, I actually haven't played since vanilla but got back into retail a few months ago.
---
I will find time...no I can't "no life" it but I'll get to 60 eventually. You gotta remember most of us are in our 30's and 40's now. MMO's hardly appeal to the young generation of gamers that are playing BRs
---
Selling account with beta access whisper with offers. Only accepting full twill sets, any BoP legendary weapons, or the necklace that dropped from Baron once. Pst
---
Why is "vanilla vets" a thing? Sounds retarded honestly. I played since beta of WoW and absolutely don't want to be called a vanilla vet.
---
Pretty cool. I hope you meet those goals and even more, fellow Azerothian!
---
It affects the economy and directly alters player behavior.
---
It's true, whoever wrote this is a retard, but it's all this sub deserves, just look at the responses.
---
Honestly, the best thing about live servers is the number of noobs.
---
ez money
---
Yea that is one of the main reasons I am leaning towards warrior. The end game itemization is freaking awesome. So many 1 handers to choose from. Druids are stuck with a level 50 BOE staff.
---
Then I offer my apologies. Again, good job on the site.
---
WUT, the prominent 'level route' is from Westwood  and you hit Duskwood at late teens early 20s.
---
Download size for the beta is about 8gb iirc
---
You can easily raid up to AQ 40 as a holy paladin using a 21 holy 30 ret build. Your bread and butter is illumination, (100% mana back on crit heals) with that you can easily get by in raid as long as you have some good +healing gear. The only thing a deep holy paladin will have over you is 5% spellcrit, even most healing pallys don‚Äôt bother to get holy shock as it‚Äôs mana to heal ratio is terrible.
---
Takes me back. Beautiful!
---
I learned those words before I was 12, but that was from playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Lots of fancy words were learned from AD&amp;D.  Transmute, polymorph, hallucinatory, commune, augury, shillelagh, glamour, prismatic, it goes on and on.
---
My wife's imp's name on her warlock in legion was literally named Fireblast....spelled properly and everything.
---
Princess hits hard with her dust cloud for example, but because she roots herself shes is very commonly kited with a shaman or warrior /pet.
---
Aye, this is really something that needs to change back to how it was back in the day. The way the numbers are shown in retail is quite unfulfilling.
---
Navak is up there
---
It's not something you would stumble upon. Facing completely backwards and still being able to attack a target is something you'd have to actively set out to do.
---
Instances were some of the quickest ways to get gold if you were not good at grinding because of spec or professions. 
---
Also remember that world drop/spawn rates will be much lower on classic than they are in private servers so the economy dynamics will be different and can‚Äôt really be predicted reliably at this point.
---
Crazy to see such comment when you see what they did so far.
---
This isn't some kind of early access, the caracters will be erased in 2 months. Chill out, play on Pserver if you can't wait and let them operate their beta howether they want.
---
There are versions and roles of PvP and PvE. Tanking, healing, ranged dps, flagrunning etc. You sound like "everything" includes it all. "Mages gotta be able to heal!!"... I never said that.
---
Being able to PvP and PvE both in general is not too much to ask, that's why Blizzard introduced dual specc at one point.
---
I‚Äôm a senior in college but I played WoW in ‚Äò04, looking back now, my parents maybe shouldn‚Äôt have let me play when I was 7, was still amazing though
---
No pvp targets?
---
I'm not surprised you're not sure what that means. A ganker is someone who sucks at the game and tends to be 40+ picking on people at level 15-30 where they barely have a shot of fighting back. You are in a bubble. 
---
Actually I change that because you're worse, you admitted to jacking off while ganking people because you stated you'd do it for hours to the same person.
---
I enjoyed World PVP, city raids were fun even when there was no rewards, the Silithus AQ event was fun stealing stupid sand from each other, going for towers in TBC. That was world pvp.
---
Not killing Joe Schmoe who just wants to finish a quest chain before doing something else and forcing him to log onto another character/quitting until you decide to go to sleep for the day.
---
&gt; You dont think the devs know that there are exploits and how they might mitigate them?
---
I do think they know they are there - that's why the layering HAS to be done by phase 2. This contradicts your first point BTW - since clearly both I and the devs know there will be exploits introduced by Layering. I hope the devs do mitigate these problems, but we haven't had any statements about how. So I have to assume they aren't.
---
&gt; That you alone noticed the potential of how a retail system might not work with classic? 
---
I am not alone in this as you have pointed out. Most people recognize that layering will open opportunities for exploits.
---
&gt; That when I say "the difference is in the implementation" thats exactly what I mean?
---
Ok that wasn't clear. I thought you meant "Layering is different from sharding because it is only one server" or something like that. Which is a silly and pedantic difference. If you meant that there is certainly mitigation already happening - fine, but there is no evidence or statements about that yet.
---
&gt; In that video I think he mean't the quest return arrows on the minimap 
---
Hmm
---
&gt; which were a thing in Vanilla. 
---
Wrong buddy.
---
This was basically how our original vanilla launch was....
---
we were in college 4 of us spent the next 5 days in a friends apartment doing a LAN. Happened to pick up the game at wal-mart 10PM few hours prior to the official launch... had it installed before the servers were up...   
---
it was a blast the only downside was if your game crashed and you were in Q while all your buddies were still in game...
---
My group I am gonna play with grew exponentially after the release announcement. Not only that but I went from probably going ally to for sure going horde. Which is awesome cause I played ally for vanilla and most of BC.
---
Looking forward to a different look for the later zones.
---
I don‚Äôt want to watch streams. I‚Äôm fine with the highlights.
---
This sub is so dramatic lmao I love it
---
I barely visit these subs. My dislike of tips is based entirely on his attitude I've seen him display in various youtube recommended videos / streams today etc. I'm not hating on him though, I'm making a joke at his expense due to a pretty laughable situation. There is a difference tbh.
---
Plenty of guilds will clear all content and only raid 1-2 days per week.
---
Prophecy set complete with benediction ü§ì
---
I absolutely love that one.  
---
I go back and replay it any time I'm wanting to get fired up to play rogue again.
---
Buy mount AT 40? Yes. 
---
The rest of it... bleh... it happens when it happens. :)
---
You can get a level per hour or so early on. Most of these guys have played 18+ hours.
---
But then they wouldn't get all the free money from people subscribing hoping to get in the beta.
---
prime example of pserver fuckery
---
Silver lining - more time to level
---
Wait... is this the SAME horde leveling guide from back in the day? I think I might have used this when I just wanted to "power level" a character back in BC.
---
most people will need over 8 weeks real time days.
---
I don't play retail anymore but heard about people 40 boxing nodes. Must have been patched out because of that. üòÇ
---
Was watching this Soda's stream at work. Tipsout got so many viewers on twitch that he burned out, lost his voice and in the end started doing stupid shit like a duche.
---
When did you start playing WoW? 
---
Not trying to be a dick, but it seems like you would not have played in the vanilla/tbs/wrath era if you're asking this.
---
Pretty sure you have to be camped at a rest area, such as city or in.  So no.
---
This is awesome news. Thanks!
---
non rested areas give rested at a rate of about 1 bubble per 32 hours, vs 1 bubble per 8 hours in a rested area
---
Same here! Fall of 2004 my life was wake up, WoW, school, Wow, social stuff, Wow, sleep.
---
Im sure people are. Their argument when it comes to changes like this is that they are not necessarily against the change but those small changes can lead to bogger changes, therefore no changes.
---
&gt; Tips just seems like a guy who thinks he remembers exactly how it was and the game is only right if it plays like it should in his head.
---
Apparently he never played Vanilla.
---
Using a private server as a demo makes sense... the rest is easy enough to figure out as you play, especially if you've played any MMO at all.
---
Oldie but a goodie.
---
Hmmph! People enjoying the game a way that is different than me makes me so mad!
---
You're not playing on the servers I've seen. One paladin camps Freewind post with his naxx gear for several hours a day. 2 others wipe out sun rock retreat all the time.
---
I am in complete agreement, thanks!
---
So what?  Being in a premade doesn't preclude people from carrying out their designated responsibilities.  The tank didn't pop any DR abilities or ask for a big heal (which the DPS did, by the way), the healer didn't heal.  Plain and simple.  Not the DPS' fault whatsoever.
---
You, uh... You really don't have much of a grasp of either what retail WoW has become *or* how patronizingly people view Vanilla content. A combination of "Vanilla was super easy and everyone was just bad because they were kids" is simply statistically wrong, and retail WoW is little more than an effectively solo player, instant gratification loot pinata.
---
Its not already in retail, it‚Äôs still.
---
Appreciated, but there's going to be hundreds of bugs - of what use is this list?
---
As I recall they had a compare window which showed in a few situations, like maybe with quest rewards, but didn't always show.
---
Everyone and their mother used the equipcompare addon, though.
---
Funny how people want to say Vanilla was 100% perfect. "Dark Pact, what a great Warlock talent!"
---
Yeah, but not this nice of weather.
---
Retail wow is the polar opposite of vanilla
---
Trade chat? Doesn‚Äôt exist in BfA.
---
It's been a while probably 10 years honestly.  I stopped playing a little after arenas came out.  Not sure if that is vanilla or tbs or wrath, can't remember.  And no worries I'm just confused I guess retail is a completely different game not just updated with new content
---
It‚Äôs possible I had a faster time. I just vividly remember the 20 hour mark cause I had a hard time beating 24. Then I did a rogue on a rp-pvp launch I hit 20 in 20. And beat my time to level 30 as well. I hit level 36 in just under 2 days played. I ended up not playing that character much after that.
---
I'm not an Azerothian Etymologist, but something like that, yeah
---
My mmorpg experience comes from runescape and ffxiv. I runescape and now oldschool runescape ive always been a PvPer, whereas in ffxiv ive always done the end game raids. I guess WoW classic is like osrs in a sense, you dont have to do all this end game stuff to enjoy it.
---
Don‚Äôt have kids
---
I saw a german and french stream.
---
if someone was to explain every little difference between classic and modern wow, itd be like a 50,000 word document, long story short is the core values and design philosophy of the games are much different so it has a totally different feel to how you do and earn things. but the short version of a VERY long story
---
Agreed. It really looked like pure inexperience from both of them. Soda was playing like he was a WotLK druid because that's what he knows. The spells and efficiencies changed dramatically by then. WotLK was the resto golden age, and the expansion where the content was substantially easier outside of the hard modes raids and achievements in all respects. He played a great class in an easy expansion. He simply didn't know that there is actual challenge in vanilla leveling dungeons, and he doesn't know how to play his class in Vanilla. But teh beauty of Vanilla is that he will learn it easily in the leveling process.
---
Tips on the otherhand... I think he's just an immature dude trying to impress his new internet celebrity friends. How can a guy who's played that much vanilla, even on undertuned private servers, scew up so much? Unless he's greatly exaggerating his experience maybe?
---
Friends aren't allowed to play jokes on each other?
---
When I was younger I would go to my friend's house to watch them play video games. Later they would come to mind to do the same. How is streaming any different?
---
Its not the same jump
---
Not sure my comment was worth down votes but whatever. It's been a few years since I played vanilla so I couldn't remember. I suppose since it's been in place so long I thought it had been there. My apologies.
---
You shouldn't need a damn sub just to get into a queue to get into a BETA. It's bad enough that you need an active sub to play a beta to test bugs.
---
Private servers are not particularly accurate to the actual vanilla client.
---
99% of streamer fanboys are true cucks irl
---
They have a reference authetic 1.12 client and server to test with. It's ok that they get some spurious reports, it's  part of the deal.
---
I don't think I could be sleazy enough to encourage that.
---
Pretty sure that was EQ2.
---
WoW did an april fool's joke with panda express once though
---
Uh huh.  Science.  She blinded me with science!
---
These men are doing god's work.  Bless them and their insanely detailed testing scenarios.
---
This. I wanna play pally and never have played alliance. It‚Äôs a classic experience AND it‚Äôs all new.
---
&gt;...so when launch is out I don‚Äôt get fucked.
---
By what?
---
Unless you're in a hardcore progression guild clearing everything as fast as possible then there's really no rush.
---
"I'm not surprised you're not sure what that means. A ganker is someone who sucks at the game and tends to be 40+ picking on people at level 15-30 where they barely have a shot of fighting back. You are in a bubble."
---
This isn't true it's just what you tell yourself so you can feel better about dying. Do some gankers suck. Sure, thats true. I also like to gank though and, I got up to 2300 rating in Arena in tbc. Not Glad but, just short. Obviously their are better players but saying I am bad is just you comforting yourself.
---
"Actually I change that because you're worse, you admitted to jacking off while ganking people because you stated you'd do it for hours to the same person."
---
The fuck? I never said I jack off to ganking people. I said I enjoy it as well as I enjoy being ganked.
---
"I enjoyed World PVP, city raids were fun even when there was no rewards, the Silithus AQ event was fun stealing stupid sand from each other, going for towers in TBC. That was world pvp."
---
Again this is what you tell yourself. As long as I approve of the pvp that is real world pvp. Well sorry buttecup not it isn't. If the only pvp you like happens only at times you find appropriate. That isn't world pvp. That's you hoping for BG's to pop in the real world.
---
"Not killing Joe Schmoe who just wants to finish a quest chain before doing something else and forcing him to log onto another character/quitting until you decide to go to sleep for the day."
---
Actually that in part is exactly what world pvp is. That is part of the fun. It gets even better when he call's in friends and suddenly all hell's broken loose in stonetalon because a war is happening. How did that war start? Normally ganking.
---
Hunter bows next?
---
"Healer isn't that great" quite the understatement. Wathing that loudmouth heal gave me ulcers.
---
Guzu, stormx, and I think perplexity is eu too
---
Ahh good old dkp.  Great way to end up with your first TF going to a hunter.
---
Think Druids will be that rare now? I‚Äôm debating between a warlock and Druid. I don‚Äôt want there to be an over abundance of healers at 60 and I know alliance locks were under represented in Vanilla...ugh. Idk.
---
nope, was like that on live
---
I guess "muh reference database things cannot be wrong" goes out of the window, expands the surface area of things to pay attention to greatly =D
---
I‚Äôm not here to hinder the experience of my guild mates. If they want to play something, then they can do whatever the fuck they want. All I need is a tank and healers.
---
Also, I‚Äôm not creating a hardcore guild, so that may be why I mostly don‚Äôt care.
---
I'm 36 with a wife and full time job, and a baby due in December. I'm still going to play.
---
If you want to make life really easy in classic since yall are a duo you could tank/heal and just pick up dps along the way. It will improve downtime since classic WoW is known for that. Just a thought.
---
It was how vanilla was.  Hitboxes weren't normalized at all in fact, and each race/gender had a different hit box.  The tauren was just the most prominent example of the hitbox differentiation, which is why its the only one most people remember.  It was roughly 2 yards, though I believe it was actually slightly larger. A low 2.X.  
---
You could jump a warrior's charge in vanilla WoW and run away before they could hamstring, but that didn't work against Tauren.  Tauren were also terrible at lava-jumping while gnomes and female humans could do so with ease.  
---
And it was absolutely addictive for multiple tauren.  Tauren didn't actually attack further, rather their hitbox was larger which made it seem like they attacked further.  You can melee attack anyone 5 yards from your hitbox, so you're a tauren attacking another tauren, its going to be much further than you think.
---
That makes this way worse then lol. 
---
&gt;Never played vanilla.
---
&gt;Gives feedback on things that aren't like vanilla.
---
&gt;Gets rolled during dungeons and questing.
---
Really hope Blizzard stuck to their guns and make this authentic.
---
5 yards is 4.57 meters
---
okay since youre a liar and an idiot here you go. divinity original sin 2, splitgate, dark souls, sekiro, risk of rain 1 and 2, rainbow six siege, insurgency sandstorm, the witcher/upcoming cd projekt red game cyberpunk, dont starve, rust, prison architect, nuclear throne, RDR 2, sub nautica, monster hunter, frost punk, civilization, Doom, borderlands, crackdown, breath of the wild, cuphead, the evil within, mass effect, titanfall 2, superhot, final fantasy, darkest dungeon. just to name a few.......  you literally named retro games and diablo 3 which is shit and you also listed LoL how about try the harder version of Lol called dota 2 maybe youve never hear of that lmao. do you want to make another shitty reply and i can give you more game titles that are solid orrrrr.
---
They said p1 didn‚Äôt they? That‚Äôs 3 months. Also 3k people per shard? I wanted vanilla pop caps not mega servers. They really need to release a realm list. I‚Äôm upset they are making new realm names too.
---
So beta tester don't waste anyone's time by testing or reporting things that Blizzard is already aware of.
---
Ahh, I didn‚Äôt realize that to be entirely honest
---
Ignore all the distractions. The main differences are:
---
1. Class Flavor / Fantasy
---
2. Server Community
---
BONUS: Character is no longer the savior of the world -- being a small fry in a big world is way more satisfying than the center of the story.
---
And that's all the differences you need.
---
I plan on leveling both. It's been a decade since I've experienced any of those zones, I hardly remember it
---
way too much regen still
---
theres a lot of circle jerking about how new games suck but i guess people cant make decisions for themselves anymore and rule out the bad games.
---
Right because it‚Äôs definitely not going to be possible to test later right?
---
I raided in MoP, there weren't any meaningful profession recipes locked behind reps. All the good ones came from the raids themselves or from the trainer.
---
Probably right, I just have a memory of finding that hilarious, and then being sad because no pizza huts delivered.
---
Yes, it was patch 6.1 and it was literally called ‚ÄúGarrisons Update‚Äù.
---
Slingers?!
---
I'm 37, day 1 wow player (purchased the Collectors edition on a whim the day before it came out being a huge Warcraft 2 fan) - and I just bought the 15th anniversary edition.

Druids aren't strong healers at this level either, especially ones without full mana and dpsing the boss.
---
downvotes for science? im calling Bill Nye

They're the difference between eating a chocolate flavored icecream cone and a liquorice flavored icecream cone (and I mean real liquorice, not the pathetic american "liquorice".  
---
They look very similar, but once you bite into it you will either have a sweet, milky chocolaty delicious experience, or basically gag and vomit.  
---
[This](http://dancouto.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cornetto-Chocolate-2.jpg) is delicious.  
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/8cqIvRO.png) is not.
---
Thanks for posting this, it's exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for. Simple and easy to save so you can retrieve it later when you need it.
---
You can raid in whatever spec you want as long as your guild doesn't mind and you don't mind the loss in efficiency for your role.
---
It's so aggravating having these people destroy the sub. The sub is going to be entirely Asmongold/StaySafe/Tipsout/Esfand fanboys once release happens. You'd have to be a true cuck to just follow these guys around all day instead of actually playing (or watch them play instead of playing). The entire thrill of a game like WoW is playing it for yourself.
---
pserver mob health and damage are +30% from what they should be
---
it's basically Diablo 3 at this point
---
You're the type of person to report someone if they gank you lol.
---
Wailing Caverns only had one jump.
---
Rush was/is a once in a generational talent. We played swtor together and he dominated there as well. Hell be at my wedding next month. Myz I got to run w a bit he was declining in play when I joined but it was always a pleasure running w him.  Zeroz was the absolute best warrior I ever saw play the game.  Mynis went rank 14 was probably the most active pvp war in req. Prom and crusher were both human but I think both white human. I'm not recalling the one ur referring too. Id love to see Rush's 14 video
---
I'm legit making a new warlock if my Felhunter won't be named Jhaaghon.
---
DONT DO IT JIMMY
---
Not perfect but, far superior.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm confused how people can claim bugs in regen, damage etc.
---
Because they are basing it on pserver info, which is not the gold standard of anything.
---
Woah now, are Wrath babies free from their curse now?
---
You've got me there.
---
LOL buzzwords like SJW then enjoy your game being destroyed by people that get offended by everyone and report in-game.  When you were able to say anal whatever enjoy being reported for being homophobic. Enjoy being banned by SJWs or leftist hired by Blizzard the same company that banned the OK sign recently from Overwatch events.  If there is a reporting feature it will destroy the game nor will I play and live under the scrutiny of the forever offended over EVERYTHING.
---
IMO Paladins should 'adin', just 'din' doesn't cut it. Personally I'll be rolling druid.
---
I definitely don't.
---
What I remember
---
Had to grind constantly to keep enough gold/mats for raids.
---
Raids were intense and you die a lot.  Even if you are in the third best guild on the server, you probably haven't even done the first boss of NAX
---
PVP was awesome and I liked arenas a lot too when they came out.  Getting to rank 14 is impossible unless you have unlimited cocaine.
---
Friends,. You see people around a lot and get to know ppl.
---
Skill was appreciated,. In raids people had custom trackers for dps and healing and everyone would try to get the top spot.
---
Bitterness, when someone gets a chest plate you wanted but the gm gave it to them.  On the flip side one of the best feelings was when I was the first person in my guild to get Perdition blade.
---
Economy- used to slang those blue leather gloves for 5g a piece and make bank.  Think this was my first lesson in economies when I was 13 lol.
---
All 3 are EU and playing with 100-120 ms latency
---
I hate on them. I want vanilla testers. People who were max level during vanilla.
---
Layering HAS to be done by phase 2 because of community continuity, not exploits. That was always the fundamental problem. Exploits are fringe cases basically not even worth addressing, though they still will be.
---
Yup. The NPCs simply happen to be a bit more sentient than usual.
---
And the thing is, that's not a bad thing if your game is an ARPG. PoE is a soloplayer game that just happens to have multiplayer features, and I fucking *love* PoE. But WoW was never supposed to be an ARPG, and it's slowly been corrupted that way after a series of concessions to fickle Candy Crush fanatics.
---
That's a lot of warlocks.
---
Imagine saying cuck unironically lol get a fucking life we just want footage since we cant play ourselves what else do you wanna discuss right now?
---
Hi, /u/TheOstrich66
---
As you should. As you should.
---
&gt; reference database things cannot be wrong
---
The reference database and the imported one in Wow Classic are 100% identical. The engine is not and this is where the bugs are coming from. Luckily Blizzard has a working 1.12 client, source code and all, which they can refer to whenever stuff like this comes up.
---
@strobber7 Themechanic is now level 25. Skroch remains level 26 at time of posting. Thanks
---
I really like this
---
Well if I ever get an invite I'll find out. Because I ain't subbing to stand in line for a beta. I'd sub FOR the beta but not to stand in line. That's ridiculous
---
According to her twitter [Hist](https://twitter.com/hist/status/1128957929216888832) got access and can play without an active sub.
---
That's objectively untrue. It needs to be over by phase 2 because of world bosses and exploits related to world bosses if layering is in the game.
---
I was thinking about it but I really want to play a female gnome warlock with pink hair.  In all fairness I already played through both factions during vanilla though.
---
seems like deadmines is way too easy
---
I mean, I still don't *like* that it's so far out, but actually having a date does seem to somehow make it easier to make peace with the whole thing.
---
I suppose now the goal is to get out and make some new friends this summer so I'll have some fellow nerds to jump into the game with come not-quite-September.
---
Sometimes I wonder if he watches the highlights of other streamers and copies them. Or does very minimal research before talking on stream.
---
That's not even close to what's shown in the video.
---
And despite this, you could get similar behavior with buggy lag, but it wasn't the same as consistent hitbox extension. You can find dozens more videos with even more egregious buggy hitbox hits, but it doesn't reflect consistent reality
---
Even changing druid forms could really screw things up, but only temporarily that you'd only notice in a static testing environment.
---
I remember specifically testing the tauren hitbox with my friend, and it wasn't significant as in OP's video
---
Most of my memories are from BC and later but there was definitely good built in floating combat text. A lot of people used mods for it too to customize and make crits different colors
---
There‚Äôs yet to be someone who doesn‚Äôt want layering, to be able to provide me a reason as to why having layers is worse than having thousands of people in the starter zones and everyone running at 5fps and spending a week in the starter area due to competition for mobs.
---
I think people just want to bitch and wear their tinfoil hats on how blizzard is fucking us over every which way
---
can't like it doesnt work or like it wont cast
---
I‚Äôd still say it‚Äôs a pretty end game focused game.  Some people like the leveling process, but I can‚Äôt stand it personally.  I play for the PvP (only fun part of leveling IMO) and end game raiding.
---
I want make a reference about not being able to read long walls of text due to being an idiot but you'd misconstrue that as well like you've done with every single one of your responses lol. I can clearly tell you also don't know how to read because half your responses are filled with the same error over and over again. Enjoy your bubble.
---
That's TBC...
---
Yeah, the game has changed a lot since then. You don't roll for loot it's all personal, it's basically impossible to die to 5 man dungeons (or out in the world at all unless you are physically trying or being exceedingly dumb), there's still 5 man dungeons but they're a joke/you need to do mythic.
---
It's a completely different game in just about every aspect, including lore.
---
36, father of 3, time demanding job, reporting in.  I don't know if I will get to raid, but I will have a core group to hit up 5 mans at least!
---
and this is where testing comes in.  Private servers have muddied the waters in terms of perception on the game, so it is hard to remember this for sure.
---
Jesus some people on this sub have such a hate boner for streamers. If you dont like their content dont watch. They are just enjoying the game like you all will, but they happen to be doing it on stream. God forbid a clip gets posted to this sub and we get one less "Thinking of rolling x class" post.
---
Real talk, can we get one for two handed maces?
---
I mean I graduated years ago but am going back to college
---
I'll just wait and see :)
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/R3ONYHj](https://imgur.com/a/R3ONYHj) DL for anyone interested
---
One thing I loved about vanilla was that getting dungeon blues was still an achievement. I knew plenty of people who's endgame WAS the 5-man dungeons. 
---
Even when I was in bloodfang I still ran 5-mans for various reasons.
---
Found the Roleplayer... *highfive*
---
Maybe he forgot that he played with a quest tracker mod back then. Def intend to watch these clips later though.
---
That's not what I meant. The actual database is correct but if every interpretation has to be coded manually anyway then it's just semantics because at the end of the day it means everything must be checked manually.
---
No worries, it sucks but I‚Äôll bounce back.
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to dry my tears with my soon to be level 60 Hunter.‚Ä¶ And his 37 DPS.
---
Better than most system documentation I've seen.
---
I put more spaces in it not sure why they are not there. Also not sure why your being so hostile. Maybe I said something nasty. If I did I am sorry. It's easy to drop a throw away line on the internet that rubs people the wrong way.
---
Edit: yea I tried putting tripple spaces between each line starting from your quote but, they go away.
---
Yeah, you probably picked the worst example to show why fury is good. Sweeping strike is on a whole over level compared to improve cleave (which is garbage), so for AOE, arms is miles ahead. Fury is nice for piercing howl, the crit early and in group for the improved shout. But with no /sit enrage, it is inferior to arms, especially when arms get sweeping strikes.
---
A few months? More like a few weeks. Even Apex Legends had people swapping back to their main games after 3 weeks.
---
As much as people want to shit on live it would still get more views then classic off the back of MDI and Arena streams alone.
---
I thought I heard  [\[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)
---
This is the only website I've seen and its more of a status than "These are being developed for Classic".
---
[https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/)
---
I asked TipsOut on his stream last night and he said that BfA addons should be compatible but that was it.
---
I haven't seen any official word from Blizzard about addons in the beta.
---
Gank away. Can‚Äôt kill me if I‚Äôm not flagged.
---
Was it self-only in vanilla? I can't quite recall... I thought you could cast it on party members.
---
I've actually found at least early levels the mobs are easier. For example on pservers vile familiars just spam fireball making it hard to pull them back. They don't do that in beta.
---
The voodoo trolls on echo isle cast heal every time at 20% health. And beta they do not
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
Why did they ruin it sobad
---
I was the closed beta, didn't like it and went and played City of Heroes. Changed my mind and came back in time for the open beta and got to see the great demon invasion that ended the beta. That was probably the most fun I had in WoW, tbh. Tigole running around as a giant dwarf in Org, fire raining from the sky, death everywhere...good times. Opening AQ and fighting with other raid guilds over world spawns like Azuregos and Kazzak was almost that much fun, but nothing ever really matched the beta apocalypse.
---
Also, I'm only thirteen.
---
&gt; Looks like I made a mistake on the quest arrows. Mandela effect on fully display. My bad on that mistake.Ôªø 
---
I wouldn't call that a good admission of being wrong, he blames it on the "Mandela Effect" which involves the universe literally shifting dimensions. He's saying that the universe had to literally shift dimensions for him to be wrong.
---
I just don't understand why he couldn't at least play on a private server to learn Vanilla before making so much content for a game he never played or at least meaningfully played. Private servers, even some of the ones known for "good scripts" get a lot of things wrong (like line of sight issues that were not in vanilla), but they don't get things wrong like adding a huge retail feature into the game.
---
I really don't mind someone like Tips playing beta, it's interesting to see what someone who's never played vanilla thinks of the game. But I don't like it when people like him try to pretend they were vanilla veterans to get some kind of "gamer cred". It's okay if you didn't play vanilla, just own it and be yourself. No one likes fakeness.
---
many people in that same situation... I am in a raid team of around 23 people in the same boat and were almost done with the heroic content. We should have it all down before the next raid tier comes out. We only raid a couple of hours 2 nights a week.
---
The only problem I see is the 40 man raid size, but Im sure people like us can find a team that makes it work.
---
Holy shit lol my local GameStop had available preorders. thought i was boned from getting it. You‚Äôre a savior man appreciate the call out. Got mine set :)
---
This sub has turned into a whine-fest to an absurd degree since the release date/beta announcement.
---
not if you're Tips
---
I am not a betting man at all, but I feel it's pretty certain that you will find casual guilds littered throughout classic. Most of the big streamers are really pushing this gung-ho mentality (why? I don't know). I feel the majority will be just like you, casual players who just prefer the play style and game of classic but still have stuff to do outside of the game.
---
33, wife, 2 kids, full time job. Played almost non stop since vanilla. Still raid 2 days a week. It is doable with alot of will power and a understanding partner. For me, playing wow is my hobby and everyone can enjoy a hobby regardless of age or life style.
---
That seems to be correct and working as intended.
---
If you are on pvp server and in Red ridge you get auto flagged. That being said. As I said It was a joke. No way in hell I am going all the way to red ridge.
---
eh?
---
The classic achievement system.
---
&gt; interpretation has to be coded manually anyway 
---
They don't. Only the ones that are working incorrectly which would only be a small part of the entirety of the mechanics in the game engine.
---
&gt; release is months away
---
Nonsense. It's only 102 days 33 minutes and 40 seconds away.
---
ed : 102 days 32 minutes and 54 seconds.
---
ed2 : 102 days 31 minutes and 33 seconds.
---
Ok, so you got 8 letters for your "adin" then.
---
Yeah the hate is kinda ridiculous on this sub
---
Good. He is a horde player. I approve :)
---
Night elf run to westfall. I don‚Äôt run through wetlands. I swim left along the coast to the second cove. The left most one on the dun morogh map. If you zone in to dun morogh there and drown yourself you rez in the dwarf starting area gy. Then run to if and gg. I wonder if that cove will still be dun morogh?
---
that was an everquest april fools joke
---
Depends on the guild. Progression raiding? Probably not.
---
Casual raiding? I dont see why not.
---
I will be playing ret paladin which is the same way on alliance. There is an axe however, Nightfall i think it was...which if you have that...is something raid teams like...and is best on lower dps classes. So ret/enhance.
---
Just hope that helps man...im gonna be dealing with this kind of thing myself lol. (Though i will probably end up healing by force anyways)
---
Also, enhance pvp is badass if you know what you are doing. I LOVED IT i played that end of vanilla into tbc arena. They are terrible against hunters though (what melee isnt) lol.
---
I'm only going to play Classic for an extended period of time if I have the option for HD models. Frankly the old models make me want to gouge my eyes out. Call me pedantic or whatever, but it's what put me off most private servers that actively stomped down on HD mods, I only played those that didn't give a damn.
---
I will very happily nitpick the new models all day long, but the sheer leap in fidelity is too much to ignore. I'd love to play Classic but in a new coat of paint. So long as it's optional I don't see the harm. We already have all the fancy graphical stuff EXCEPT the HD models, might as well go all the way. There was a point where the old and new models co-existed in 6.1 or so, but in 7.0 where they started overhauling class animations they gradually phased them out.
---
Asking for the new models doesn't mean I'm gonna suddenly ask for LFG/LFR and all that. Slippery slope my arse.
---
I played Alliance last time, going Horde.
---
It's trash,you can buy so much stuff from the blizz store for less than 60 bucks ,then what they give you in that box
---
I have to say that what Perplexity and Tribe are doing is exactly how you should be playing a Beta. Pretending that the Beta is the real game and that the character you're playing is your main is silly, and unfortunately there are plenty of Beta testers doing that atm. Also, Tips should not say that a Boss is 100% guaranteed bugged just because his group wiped. 
---
I clearly remember Verdan the Everliving from vanilla WoW and he did indeed hit hard as fuck. Just get better (higher level, better gear/skills). Simple as that.
---
PvP you are at the mercy of wind fury Crit rng. PvE your dps will sucks and you will just be there to apply a nightfall debuff. It‚Äôs really just a leveling spec. From what I‚Äôve read.
---
I remember specifically testing this in Vanilla, and it wasn't as large as it seems in the video. 1-2 yards is a *big* difference, because the area doesn't scale linearly but by the power of 2, which matters a lot when moving.
---
I played both an undead and tauren melee, so I became well acquainted with the difference.. and it wasn't basically range weapon distance.
---
Are these difficult to make?
---
I never played classic but i did play during burning crusade a little bit. Till about level 22 and I played cata till level 30. Never really got into wow until wod and even then I didn‚Äôt play as much till legion
---
I really could have sworn the Weapon and Bracer enchants were both locked behind Revered reputations, like Shadopan I think were the weapons and celestials for the bracers. I also think there were some +patches to pants that give stats as well (I remember these existing but they removed them the expansion later)
---
I only remembered that it was a thing (since I have a number of level 1 name savers I've logged in and once or twice they had some rested when I logged into them again to goof around). 
---
I had to look up the exact values lol
---
Fair enough, no bonus gold or xp on the beta?
---
Its use is this:
---
"If you are reading this and play the beta then stop reporting these specific bugs as we are already aware of them."
---
I would have taken advantage of that in WoW back then for sure lol
---
What we know for sure is phase hopping is a thing (either on retail &amp; privates). We also know that it hurt vanilla persistant world, and may be exploited. And still layering is involving phase swapping. Maybe they have found some fixes, but from what we get with interview &amp; explanation it is unlikely.
---
After having leveled an Alliance warlock and paladin and a Horde hunter to 60 I'm definitely going Alliance. Can't stand the Horde aestethics... and I adore Ironforge.
---
Took me 7 to complete a 4yr degree. Then ppl go for graduate degrees aswell. Ppl lead different lives.
---
As long they don‚Äôt fail like HOME(ies) :P
---
Legit true for me. I went back to college in my 30's. :P
---
I've seen one yesterday and IIRC it was because they were a fansite creator.
---
they're obviously gonna fix this - this is not how it was in vanilla.  I played a tauren hunter in like 1.1 or something and it wasn't that bad on the deadzone.  Also then as a tauren warrior you did have a slightly larger melee range but not as pronounced as that.
---
Weather was neat but it occurred way too frequently. The novelty wears off pretty quickly and then it becomes annoying.
---
Add a counter for how many times you kill bosses with super rare loot. (i.e. Baron Rivendare)
---
Add a counter for how many low level players you can gank with a broom, shovel, or other hilarious weapons.
---
Hi, /u/Grimy__range
---
Umm, they literally use the actual 1.12 vanilla client.
---
Only time I min max is when I‚Äôm raiding as I feel like I should to be respectful of my guild / fellow raiders, and I‚Äôm competitive and like seeing how far I can push my character.
---
I certainly won‚Äôt be approaching leveling in this manner tho.  Going to take it a bit slower and go where ever I feel like going and certainly plan on engaging in lots and lots world PvP while leveling  starting with the first opposing faction player I come across.
---
When you stop your levelling race to listen to the weather :)
---
Wow thats awesome. I might be looking at getting one made for myself and throw a couple bucks at whoeever does it when i make my toon.
---
I used to do a lot of ZF back in the day, was it known for being difficult? I remember it as being pretty easy with normal tactics like ccing extras.
---
Hey man, despite all the hate here, I ll try to give you the most realistic answer, why it is a bad idea. Imagine, you are farming mats in Felwood and you encounter another opposite faction warlock. First thing most people do is, they determine, how much of a threat he is to you. How? Well, mostly by checking up his hp/mana stats and also equipment (chest, shoulders, head, cloak and weapon are most visible pieces). This is not possible with that transmog bullshit. Now it seems like unimportant part of WoW, but it is in fact a very important feature in WoW. You dont wanna mess with warlock in full T3 right? And if he represents such threat to you because of his superior equip, you dont want to see him in green/rare transmog, that will trick you into thinking, he is an easy target. Seeing your target's proper equip is even more important in TBC, with the introduction of competitive PvP in arenas. This is also a reason, why its so popular for PvPers to hide their head and cloak in settings, so people ll have hard time determining their equip
---
What is glaringly obvious is that none of the current issues in debug mode are considered game breakers.  They can be hotfixed.  Testing this game on stream is more a gauge of interest and hype not real testing
---
Damage and healing wasn't a thing in vanilla
---
I remember when they changed +damage and +healing into damage and healing in BC, and my resto shaman was very happy
---
He is definitely not averaging 8k viewers yearly, top streamers barely hit that except Asmon. He is far from a top dog, you overestimate his income by a lot imo.
---
You can force it to run in and attack a mob, that's what they're referring to.
---
He's not managing his pet.
---
No Owl Clowns in muh raid tha's fo' sure.
---
Method had over 100k when doing mythic ghuun, no one cares about asmongold
---
The green item drop rate looks WAY too high on his stream, literally a green every 3 mobs
---
I MISS THE RAINS DOWN IN AZEROTH
---
I just did these from an old private server screenshot, so send it my way when u make ur toon :)
---
It says ‚Äúrandom enchantment‚Äù on items that have random enchantments in debug mode
---
&gt;Had to grind constantly to keep enough gold/mats for raids.
---
Not anymore. In fact, there's an automated procedure to generate a PUG raid group for you, and all boss mechanics are built into the interface so you can learn them on your own.
---
&gt;Raids were intense and you die a lot. Even if you are in the third best guild on the server, you probably haven't even done the first boss of NAX
---
Maybe the Mythic raids have some difficulty. Otherwise, I reiterate that raids are now cleared by mute PUGs.
---
&gt;PVP was awesome and I liked arenas a lot too when they came out. Getting to rank 14 is impossible unless you have unlimited cocaine.
---
PvP is... still sorta alright? But the classes are super homogenized now, so it's a lot less flavorful.
---
&gt;Friends,. You see people around a lot and get to know ppl.
---
Nope. Sharding is a core feature of servers in retail, in which players from other servers will be temporarily instanced into your zone and then disappear soon after if you move too far away. Like, they'll literally disappear from the screen.
---
&gt;Skill was appreciated,. In raids people had custom trackers for dps and healing and everyone would try to get the top spot.
---
Again, there are Mythic raids for guilds that actually care about progression. But all of the content on its "normal difficulty" can be cleared by blind mimes.
---
&gt;Bitterness, when someone gets a chest plate you wanted but the gm gave it to them. On the flip side one of the best feelings was when I was the first person in my guild to get Perdition blade.
---
Most loot is now in the form of equally distributed tokens or out-of-raid acquisition mechanics so that everyone gets their loot all the time and nobody feels sad or wanting. It's the MMO equivalent of a force-feeding tube for fois gras ducks. And all gear is transmogged into your favorite skin anyway, so there's no prestige in having good gear, and everyone can look exactly as they want all the time. Invitations to groups and raids are determined by your combined itemlevel of your gear, since actual player skill matters not a whit.
---
&gt;Economy- used to slang those blue leather gloves for 5g a piece and make bank. Think this was my first lesson in economies when I was 13 lol.
---
You can buy gold for game time and sell gold for game time with WoW tokens. Gold is all super inflated anyway, and people use it for stuff like NPC vendor mount purchases because the best gear is all already given to you and BoE BiS stuff has been nonexistent for years.
---
It's fucking bad, man. It would be fine if WoW were *actually* a single-player game, but it's not. It's a mutated husk of its former self. There's a reason so many people are excited for Classic.
---
Yeah same for me I have such good memories of listening to the game soundtrack and questing / healing at night time easily the best part of the game for me.wheather effects I personally don't care that much about but still glad they are there of course. But night time is a really big one for me especially because it's not a generic circle but real server time
---
I was ten when it launched and played with my mom, now 15 years later I'm getting a masters. So I am still in school but wish I wasnt :(
---
The list should include dagger a reward from rogue quest which has tons of dps for a level 20.
---
Yep the dude was constantly saying incorrect / faulty information in a lot of his classic videos.
---
So if you're so far above watching Twitch streams, if you do anything else while you're playing a game, what is it?  
---
There are far more personalities on Twitch than the few you've narrowed it down to.
---
My character's pasty white skin gives me negative sun resist...need barber shop /s
---
Lmaooooo
---
No, it needs to be over before phase 2 because if it's not, then there should have just been 2 servers. You're again making vast assumptions about how layering will work that you do not know.
---
We still don't know the specifics of how moving between layers works (or under what circumstances it's possible). that's what I mean when I say you have NO clue what you're on about
---
I'd honestly love the bfa rain sound effects and the vanilla weather effects.
---
Look, I respect your opinion but I have to say, the salt is real eh? LOL
---
True. There is an argument though that some are playing the game like they would on release and are not using the privilege they have with beta currently to report anything. I've seen several large scale streamers show bugs and not report them due to this 'race to 30'.
---
No, not really. I made these from old screenshots we had from private servers.
---
It does seem pretty high doesnt it
---
How do people not know how to screenshot things in 2019....
---
they did, but not as much as that.
---
Yeah I have read some great posts about how xmog ruined the aspect of "showing off". Having a full item set wasn't just powerful, it held some esteem
---
For the Horde!
---
There‚Äôs one part where I can see this on the right where you can accidentally run a circle if your not familiar. It also doesn‚Äôt help it‚Äôs multi leveled with a shit map for that part.
---
He isnt wrong.  Zero game breaking bugs found.  Nothing that cant be hotfixed
---
It is pretty close. It would be even closer if not identical if two taurens would try to hit each other like in the video OP posted. 
---
If you have a video showing the opposite feel free to post it.
---
It was no where near that bad in actually vanilla tho - although it totally was a thing.
---
I'll take a mage for humanoid CC every time. Mages take talents to reduce sheep resists, but succubus has nothing like that. Also succubus is unable to seduce many elite humanoid targets that a mage can sheep, and there's no way to predict which until you try -- it's arbitrary/unpredictable.
---
Using fear as CC in a dungeon run is just calling down the lightning.
---
I'm not - this has literally been discussed that if you have layering in phase 2, it fucks up world bosses. Think about it - with layering there would be TWO OR MORE Kazzaks. That would be a massive problem.
---
Your reason it needs to be over doesn't really make sense. If that's the ONLY reason, then they could get rid of it in Phase 3. The time they get rid of it is arbitrary if that is the ONLY reason (which it is not)
---
because not many germans for example post on english forums bro
---
Hmm yes it's almost like elites have a higher chance of dropping greens. Better file a bug report and write in to your senator.
---
hes has 87k for a level 20 dungeon on a beta lmao. Bringing up retail on a classic sub good one
---
" Are there no 5 man raids in the game currently? " given an example I don't know a 5 man raid in retail. " Is there no rolling for gear in current game? " not in BFA
---
Yeah true. If Im being honest with myself, 2 kids, run a business, wife, I won't be progression raiding... So I may consider going enh
---
They are all elite mobs in the mines man, it's pretty normal in a party of 5. 
---
There's a bit of RNG helping them sure but it doesn't seem that far off, when they were questing earlier they maybe saw 1-2 greens over several hours.
---
Elite loot tables have more greens in them since they are...you know, ELITE
---
0/10
---
Awww, fair enough
---
Good sample size
---
It seems like a lot of people do care, and if your job relies on people turning into see you play, you might want to think about how you act on stream.
---
I played enhance on one of the private servers, and it's pretty much only gonna be a good time I'd you manage to find a guild that allows you to be that enhance guy. 
---
You can get okay gear through PvP, bit it takes a long time. 
---
Much of the gear you'll be wearing will simply be having attack power, rather than str or ago. Then you'll have a few pieces with strength too most likely. 
---
But yeah, you'll be dreaming about one hitting people, but won't have the gear to do so, and will pretty much be last pick in the activities where you get that gear.
---
27 year old undergrad here. Did the navy thing and now I‚Äôm a full time regular student. I‚Äôm sad about the classic release date cause it‚Äôs after fall semester starts :(
---
Yeah that's basically the vibe I remember unfortunately
---
Always played alliance. Going to horde this time around
---
Add it to the list. Another thing flying ruined.
---
It's insane how people either like him, or think he's worse than Hitler.  It's like there's no alternative.
---
Thanks for the solid feedback. I, in no way, think that all of the changes I stated should happen. Or that that even have a place in Classic WoW.
---
That being said, I imagine there are some QoL changes that don't directly impact the game or effect anything. For me, the barber shop is a good example of that.
---
If the community felt it would ruin the game then I am all for not having it implemented. I am just simply trying to see what the reasoning behind peoples change vs. no change is. And the timeline they would find acceptable
---
All I can go off is private servers, same mobs had no where close to this high drop rate.
---
Is he really trying to rejuv+regrowth spam at that level?
---
Greens dropped all the time from elite mobs back in vanilla.
---
It‚Äôs not a big deal. Beta are just another marketing tool now. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you level fast or know the game to its little details, what matters is the size of your audience.
---
I also like enha shaman but If you want to raid you have to go as resto. I Love PVP if you have the luck of the dice u can 1 hit allies n good use of the totems against rogues, hunters bcoz of their poisons. Gl
---
yeah but this is also clearly a bug, taurens had a larger hitbox but it wasn't as big as this in vanilla.
---
Seems to be around 10 per second every 2 second intervals with some spirit on the gear level 17.
---
At least the 2 second interval is right.
---
Thanks for understanding why I made this post, for this level of conversation. I totally understand your point
---
I work at a GameStop (currently on the clock. Shhhhhh) and they are still available for preorder right now. $25 down to reserve one. I got mine this morning =D
---
Might have felt too inconsistent to have weather effects in the old worlds and not the new ones.
---
Why are you apologizing for using WoWhead? Is that bad?
---
Maybe some, it's been a while, but I don't recall any from reps. It didn't really matter unless you were in a heroic guild, and I wasn't so I might have just not used them all.
---
Cant you read ?   
---
 For the people that want better graphics, give it to them. For the people that want old school polygons, let them play that way.   
---
You didnt even make it to the second phrase, congrats. Its all about the options, no one needs to be upset when there are a couple small sliders to make everyone happy.
---
After watching methods GM raid on twitch, i decided to try what he does. Eat nuts, bananas and drink only water instead of stocking up on chips and diet coke.
---
It's all the fuckin people that came here from the announcement.
---
I'd like to see them go the same route with starcraft as they attempted so long ago.
---
Ugh what an embarrassing mistake
---
That sucks man. This is what I was thinking too...
---
That's the thing. I don't do anything else. I'm *playing the game*.
---
 Classic is going to be led by streamers and influencers, not reputable players. This simply can't be reverted.  It's the harsh truth. For every anti-streamer, there are 10 streamer fans. Just another divide in the community. Very unfortunate
---
I had saber riding skill on my human mage back in vanilla and I vaguely remember doing night elf zone low level quests at 60, but I could be wrong and it could have just been AV and rune cloth.
---
I do remember shit tons of rune cloth hand ins.
---
Ya, at what point did we move away from the middle ground? If you post something nice about a streamer, even when you state you are not a fan of them personally, people call you fanboi and other stupid shit. How come we can no longer just tolerate people? We have to love them or hate them, no middle? LOL
---
Reddit wasn't around in 2004 so we shouldn't really be discussing anything here if we want to stay true to classic
---
Only reason I works for retail is because someone is able to pay real money for the gold, which would be pretty dumb if you could buy gold through blizzard for classic
---
Oh I fucking hate retail but I also hate asmongold
---
I'm gonna sign up August 1 so that way both my auto-payments come in on Payday and I get a chance to snag my more common user names. I get a feeling Pancakes and Faucet are going to go pretty quick so it's important I get in there first.
---
Might have been an add on I remember then..
---
Mobs seem to have significantly more abilities than on Pservers
---
this is peak continuum fallacy
---
Thanks for the feedback, I imagine you and I share some of the same ideals.
---
Though I am all for helping Classic still feel like Classic too
---
Like I don't really get it - I like the new graphics personally and if you're someone who doesn't like them you can just turn it on to 'classic' mode?
---
What's the BFD
---
Ya fuck. I will not heal. All of the years I've played wow I haven't healed except for leveling. I really, really dont enjoy it
---
Why would you go off private servers? 
---
Blizzard knows what official vanilla was like more than private servers, who adjust a lot of values based on what they thought it should be.
---
I don‚Äôt think you know what pedantic means.
---
The bar is still that low. And we still have to kick people.
---
I know people moan about Asmongold, but Esfand is such an insufferable bellend in comparison.
---
I would reckon that the stress test will be separate from the Beta. I hope I am wrong but I don't think so
---
Does anyone else see this is extremely greedy on their part? They know people will subscribe only to get the invite, and most probably most of them still wont.
---
I'm hoping to name my druid either "Druid" or "Mooid"
---
And yet, here you are, using those people as your soap opera.
---
Yeah that's 100% fine, but if someone makes a living off knowing vanilla and being on the #nochanges train then they should know the basics.
---
On mute, it is much better.
---
I'm pretty sure they will just be temporary invites
---
I'm not a fan of twitch at all but it has made work today go by quick living vicariously through these guys. It also made me laugh when he complained about his lack of rage and losing rage after swapping stances.
---
You can, beware of not having any trainers potentially and other class quests might not be available either.
---
Once you're in, then you're in.
---
What are crushing blows?
---
Some people are just classic autists. I played vanilla on a toaster with 30 frames and shit graphics. Why would I not want it to actually look good and run smoother, providing gameplay is the same???
---
You can, you just had to run there, if I recall
---
Both trash.  TBC did more damage to vanilla than any other expansion.  Cataclysm was just the killing blow.
---
private servers ARE NOT vanilla servers, your comparison wouldnt be true to vanilla cause many drop tables were guesswork in private servers
---
probably because you're a nitwit and don't have a clue
---
also
---
wow good god thats so LAZY of you to not explain yourself smfh
---
I love the classic weather effects, good to see they are here.
---
Some quests are race specific and you have to be mindful of where trainers are but yes of course you can do this. You're not going to get a GM come down and port you back to your starting zone for running somewhere else.
---
Wasnt he the one making videos about how we're not going to know everything based off of private servers and now he's over acting like the thing he's not used to is bugged?
---
I don't get why you guys are saying it's not possible. It was literally how the game worked in WoD. There was a toggle in the graphics options. You didn't even need to reload the game.
---
You'd just be making things harder for non-meme specs.
---
I'm healer in retail wow. Whenever I see a disc priest in the raid I take a big ol' sigh cause it means I have to work that much harder to make up for them being a waste of a slot.
---
Healers only have so much mana, in Vanilla especially. You can't ignore things like that in favour of memery.
---
I hate this unironically
---
Having your characters positioning stagnant makes them hold a place on your screen forever, making it a big deal to have your main in the #1 spot because that means you either deleted other characters or stuck with it the whole time.
---
Bring on the downvotes.
---
I think youll find this is going to be the major demographic. I will be forming a raid guild for the weekenders. Just for this reason. Just play to enjoy the game :) i know i will!
---
I went through a similar thing, dropped out of highschool due to depression, bummed around for a while, and graduated last year with a degree in electrical engineering. A linear path to education/success would've been nice, but its not in the cards for everyone.
---
he didn't play on pserv. Not until classic was announced at least and he just came in trying to cash in, which he succeeded to do cause there will always be tools like you to worship those smiling frauds.
---
And if that Druid had rolled Rogue they'd be twice as good with the same amount of effort...
---
Please don't pretend the hostilities weren't coming from your end either "buttercup."
---
I am quite capable of reading text, squashed together or not. The definition of world pvp is unorganized fighting outside of their structured battlegrounds. It doesn't rely heavily on camping, if there person wants to fight back thats fine, thats fun.   
---
When you start putting I, rather than what it actually is you lose the ability of forming an argument. PvP isn't what you approve. PvP is what it is. I played PVP up until either Wod or Legion, after that my group switched to PVE because most of us grew up and realized we didn't have time to waste on shit (I want to say this ironic since classic will be a bit more time intensive but I don't know what my group will be doing whether pvp or not).
---
Perplexity said it wouldnt work
---
COunt on using Raptor Strike and Wing Clip a lot early on.
---
Then as you level you can start using FD to drop agro to your pet.
---
Trap if you know you are pulling more than 1 mob
---
Typically you want to get 2 - 3 auto shots in before you have a pet to tank so you need to shoot run until you can shoot again then run then shoot by that  time it will be in your face
---
I suggest a good swing timer.
---
Fury/prot really could just be a pserver thing. It may not work in vanilla.
---
He‚Äôs in a guild called nostalrius. Fucking tone deaf clown.
---
Yes and the point is that the customer service says that you need subsciption to even opt-in, so he got that wrong, why would he not be wrong on the invite as well?
---
Dude, they still might. That was only the very first wave of beta invites. From how it was explained to me, many many more invites will be going out over the course of the next few weeks. Just relax about Joana, the dude will most likely be getting into the beta lol.
---
Kiting is a big part of the modern tanking game.
---
There is already a thread on the front page about this why do we need another
---
The drop rates are not client side so private servers have to 'guess' the values.
---
Beta keys did not only go out to streamers, if I'm not mistaken? More waves will come. There are plenty of bugs being reported. I'm not sure why there is concern for Joana not getting an invite... Maybe they will get one? Also, by giving it to streamers, they are both testing the servers *and* promoting the game, which seems like a pretty normal business decision to me, right?
---
On a laptop? Disgusting
---
That looks pretty darn cool to me
---
You're right it's one of the many reasons it will be done by phase 2, but this is too far from my original point. Which is that layering is fundamentally different from sharding.
---
What lvl is he?
---
And they're rewriting a leigon client, thise look like leigon drop rates, good chance they might have screwed up, also noticing the drops have &lt;random enchantment&gt; on them which isn't blizzlike

(Talking about the clip from this post)
---
Looks like a game breaking or at least major bug in my opinion.
---
Give them some time, we all want to play the beta but there will be more opportunities later on.
---
I mostly hope to join a stress test, i doubt i'll stand a chance with the vanilla veterans accounts having started in BC...
---
Working on my second bachelors man! Cut a guy some slack.
---
Where does it say that in your link? On the contrary, your link has the following:
---
&gt; An order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10.
---
I only watched him a few times but when I did I found him toxic and goofy, whether or not that‚Äôs his streaking persona, I don‚Äôt like him
---
the other testers who are there because they had day 1 or beta accounts from 2004 are more likly to know when a bug occurs versus someone who started playing in cata for example but got an invite
---
Source? Oh wait nvm you don't have one.
---
hint: one has 5k twitch viewers and 44k youtube subs, one has ? twitch viewers (maybe 200-300?) and \~3k youtube subs.
---
Nah man, hating people is not right. Specially since they never interact for real with people besides reading some random comments.
---
I broke the mould with naming my main Mage "UnholyFire". And never specd fire on it. Guess my new classic one should be "UnholyFrost" to make up for it.
---
Imagine getting flamed for fucking up after being awake for 24+ hours
---
Wasn't that the patch they stopped reporting sub numbers? Can't imagine why.
---
&gt; but we haven't had any statements about how. So I have to assume they aren't
---
You should be ashamed of yourself. After all of this how many times does the classic team need to prove themselves to you before you stop being alarmist about made up phase 1 exploits?
---
Yes, just be patient!
---
Fury prot? Out of the loop here, care to elaborate :)?
---
Tbh rag and the box art makes it for me. It‚Äôs so pretty. And a month a game time makes it 85 so that makes me feel better about myself
---
1. Just remember that Cheetah will daze if a mob hits you.
---
2. Probably.
---
3. Yes.
---
4. If you Feign Death you will de-aggro the mob, ultimately resetting it, unless you have a pet out. From these questions it sounds as if you plan to play pet-less? ;-)
---
I raided MC as a druid healer at 12 years old, I'm almost certain I was the reason for many, many deaths.
---
Thanks!
---
This is the only time I've ever seen him play so all evidence points to him being bad.
---
Well, he doesn't want to talk *with* someone for that long. There, he's talking *at* someone*s*
---
Your game will be ruined because there is an in-game report feature which will destroy the game. Your post was nice though I am sorry Blizzard is a shit company
---
&gt; No because each layer will have one server worth of population
---
So you're saying that if a layer holds 3000 people then a second layer will not open until there are 3000 people queued for it?
---
Otherwise a new layer will always have a lower population than the other layers.
---
Is it confirmed that Pet pathing is vanilla like? I assumed with starting with a later and building back there is a good chance things like pet pathing would be closer to retail.
---
Honestly, Guzu did such an amazing job with his stream!! He just genuinely enjoyed the game, without any elitist bullshit! It was Nice seeing the joy in his Face while playing
---
How's the game runnnig on a low spec machine for those who tried btw?
---
it's funny that they're pretending this is supposed to be difficult.. 
---
it's fucking deadmines lol
---
You must be surprised to learn that many people watch Twitch WHILE playing the game. It's hardly different than having Netflix on, or watching TV while you play.
---
If you run 5 mans in classic like you do in retail, you're gonna wipe.
---
Yea when I played classic as a kid there were tons of adults in my guild with families, responsibilities etc, and to be honest I remember it didn't work out too well for them. I remember on several occasions I had guildies who's wives left them or quit because their wife was gonna leave them. In fact thinking back I can't believe these people would spend 8-10 hours playing a game while they had families.
---
The language they used in their post sounds like stress tests are separate from the beta experience. So I think if you get invited to the stress test, you're just getting an invite to play for those 3 days.
---
That's ok, I've trained myself to be a switch hitter.
---
hurr durr no changes
---
Floating combat text was added in a patch in vanilla, it wasn't in from the start.
---
In the start you used the addon scrolling combat text.
---
And not a tank in sight.
---
Yeah some people go to professional school....
---
yes, although thats just how random enchantment is intially displayed, random enchantments still existed back then.
---
i think you underestimate the work they already put into that client, they didnt just disable everything above 60, they updated the ability/stat/loot tables for most mobs in the game to what it was back then.. the legion client is just the base, fed with data from their vanilla backups...
---
edit: if we see leftovers from legion its mostly UI / display / option things, not things like new drops or something
---
Classic beta gets a lot of things wrong too.
---
Omg he's disgusting... geez....
---
This guy is a really annoying group leader.
---
I just find the irony of a classic promoter putting in a bug report saying that a boss is too hard, to be unreal.
---
It's like he is the real 'you think you do but you don't.'
---
Oh well, I hope he gets a response back telling him it works as intended.
---
I‚Äôm still probably going to roll a shaman. Ele seems fun and you can get away with raid healing in that spec. Can‚Äôt wait to blow some gnomes up with my deez crits
---
I would suggest leveling in your own starting zones until level 10 or so then meeting up in the barrens.  It's not a big deal though, you can travel between Tirisfall and Durotar easily with the zeppelin.
---
Being unemployed is the best.
---
 I never heard of anyone doing it so o have no idea
---
Yeah that seems.. interesting. I hope Blizz is gonna give feedback to the community about this stuff.
---
&gt;talwar
---
Because they are rolling out more beta invites, you could get one tomorrow for all you know. Worth $150 for the gamble to you?

Are you on the PvE server? It's white on a PvE server, but I think it was yellow on a PvP server. I could be wrong though.
---
This is bad, and you should feel bad...
---
These exploits aren't made up. If you have layers, there will be multiple versions of each continent. Thus multipled versions of each node. Thus, you can have multiple world bosses or rare spawns. You also can move between layers so you can tackle a rare mob multiple times before its normal respawn.
---
But it's not fundamentally different. It is a tweaked version of sharding.
---
Its the first day of beta.. Jesus...
---
I mean tbh, only your enchanters needed them and I think at this point you could buy valiums or whatever that had the enchants already, so its easy for some people not to have to do the grind themselves and just buy them on the AH.
---
 MOP was when I said I no longer cared for reps/toys because it was so out of hand. Made a crap ton of money selling those dragon trinkets early on though.
---
Kicking a player is a big hassle. Easier to teach them if they're receptive to learning.  
---
In a dungeon, everyone's lives are in my hand. I expect players to be not idiotic, otherwise death will be a lesson.
---
98.362% of them are just leveling and having fun and reporting only the major bugs they find and ignoring the smaller stuff.... which is what most of us would do if we are honest. Some are diving deep and reporting lots of stuff, which to be fair some of us would do too. It grinds my gears to see them just enjoying it and not really testing but I am 32 and should be able to get past it, lol
---
Was generally for no-changes when I first heard about this whole effort but my resistances have grown weak.
---
My orders have fallen on deaf ears. Under these circumstances, I am no longer able to lead. It is over. The war is lost. But Gentlemen, if you think I am going to leave Classic. You are seriously mistaken. I'd rather blow my brains out. Do whatever you like.
---
It‚Äôs only been a day, that‚Äôs still pretty impressive to already be pushing 30.
---
All of our routes are going to be straight ass when the servers go live also. It‚Äôll be a free for all!
---
give it a few more days, the first dudes will already reach level 30 in a few hours.  
---
Hopefully they will concentrate more on mechanics and bugreporting/testing instead of racing then :)
---
Is av going to last a day again? My loins are ready
---
can you trade after you win the roll on boss loot? I thought you couldn't
---
Minimum level for any primary (also secondary IIRC) is level 5.
---
Then, minimum of level 10 for journeyman, level 20 for expert, level 35 for artisan.
---
Nothing personnel kid (?)

Exactly, if you dislike streams for some weird reason, you get to see the highlights without all the rest.
---
 Afaik you need to be level 5 to learn professions and at least 30 to train professions to 300
---
The servers are literally empty, you should be 30 in 18 hours
---
Most duskwood quests are 25+, so it's more common to do redridge, wetlands and ashenvale first.
---
These people have specifically decided to group with each other and are also on discord with each other. It's their personal responsibility to call for breaks when needed. As a DPS I have no problem telling the tank to wait since the healer is low on mana. 
---
These people all have a vested interest in the success of their run.
---
Well I think both those things are pretty unnecessary too. 
---
I don't need 12 screens in my face at all times. 
---
Like, how do you you watch a screen while you're playing a game on another screen? It doesn't even make sense. Neither screens are getting your full attention. At that point you're just wasting your own time with an excess amount of visual stimulation.
---
EPGP/DKP systems give you currency for performance/attendence where you can bid on items. 
---
Loot Council is just some dude or group of people distributing loot. Can lead to corruption or drama.

Drama queen much?

150 isnt a gamble to me... I'm perfectly okay with throwing away 150. If i did buy one and got my own beta id just let the person know he or she can sell it to someone else.
---
Deadmines, like every other dungeon in the game, is very easy if you're the right level or higher for it, and hard -impossible if you're under-levelled.  
---
If a group of 3 16s and 2 18s runs through it quickly then yes it's too easy. If a group of 2 18s and 3 22s run through it brainlessly that sounds completely normal.

&gt; Please don't pretend the hostilities weren't coming from your end either "buttercup."
---
I didn't bro, I said "Maybe I said something nasty. If I did I am sorry." My bad I tend to do that sometimes. It's a bad habit. One formed by being on the internet too much. I don't do that in real life and it bothers me I do that here.
---
"I am quite capable of reading text, squashed together or not. The definition of world pvp is unorganized fighting outside of their structured battlegrounds. It doesn't rely heavily on camping, if there person wants to fight back thats fine, thats fun. "
---
Again this would depend on how you see pvp. I like to camp people not for hours but, about a half hour before I get bored. The reason being is not because I want to camp them. Though I won't lie I do get a bit of enjoyment. I simply like to see what shakes out. 
---
It's not rare to have 60's come pouring in. eventually a battle starts and now. It's not me ganking. It 10 horde v. 12 allaince and all hell has broken loose in stone talon. This doesn't happen too much in TBC because people fly away rather then sending out the bat call.
---
"When you start putting I, rather than what it actually is you lose the ability of forming an argument. PvP isn't what you approve. PvP is what it is. I played PVP up until either Wod or Legion, after that my group switched to PVE because most of us grew up and realized we didn't have time to waste on shit "
---
This again is where I say we part. To me world pvp without consent is the most fun pvp of all. Because the stakes are the highest. People can literally steal hours from you and it's miserable. I can easily see how this can rub people the wrong way but, I enjoy it. A lot of people I know also enjoy it. As I said I don't just enjoy ganking I also enjoy getting ganked. There is a thrill in it for me. The reason I am saying I or me so much is because what type of pvp is fun is a personal opinion.
---
True, but you wouldn‚Äôt be doing WC as speed leveling. That‚Äôs a time sink.
---
I don‚Äôt care for any streamer, but clearly they aren‚Äôt going for time.
---
They will be rolled out over time.  More people will be added in batches.

The weather effects are one of the best part of classic
---
[I don't have one.](https://i.imgur.com/8RcQFre.gif)
---
I would get lvl 6-8, take the UC zeppelin to OG and meet up there
---
Man you should really take a shit more often. Especially at work. I take like 2-3 dumps a day, when being paid of course.
---
Pretty much, I've came to the conclusion I'm a petty bitch with a "IT'S NOT FAIRRRR" attitude.
---
I get why Blizzard do it this way, if they didn't care about marketing this and savign face on any serious issues like most companies, they'd stick an NDA on it. Obviously this is all to drum up hype. I never even cared for classic till I was told I couldn't have it, now the FOMO is kicking in.
---
I accept  my flaws among many. Working on it by leveling a cow paladin.
---
Okay let me rephrase that. How many times does the classic team need to prove themselves before you have even a modicum of faith?
---
Staysafe is, the one of all the streamers I mentioned by name
---
The biggest thing to me is it seems like it's going to be hard as fuck to gear. 10 year old me didn't give a damn if I had intellect gear if it was purple n shiny. Now, I'd prefer my set pieces to be useful, and for enhancement it doesn't seem like it would be since all the gear is agility

---
I guess some people are saying they eventually received an email notifying them they'd been invited and to check their battle.net client.
---
A good general rule of thumb is UI updates = neutral to good, changes that alter game mechanics or social = smack down even the smallest change.

Fear has its place, though it is rare.
---
Seduce was always fine for me.  Even if it does break you can reapply it without much effort on your part because it‚Äôs linked to the pet.
---
Banish is amazing on large pulls.  Long acting unbreakable CC.  Really useful in places like BRD with beefy elementals that do damage through armor and thus are a pain for your tank unless isolated.
---
And in super rare instances enslave demon is great CC.  It‚Äôs like mind control without locking you down with a channel.
---
Hi, /u/groatt86
---
Maybe for you, the novelty literally never wore off for me, even after years of Pservers.
---
A new character does not begin to accumulate rested until you log in with it.
---
BUT even if rested began right when a character was created they would still gain it at a lower rate since the character is not in an Inn. That means they would get about half a level of rested in the 2 weeks between Name Reserve and Launch. At level 1 that would only save them the time of killing about 4 level 1 boars or wolves or whatever.
---
That dude ALWAYS hit hard. Hell he even hit hard in later expansions.
---
We were supposed to be surprised about how easy the low level dungeons will be now that nobody is a clicker.
---
I get these guys are playing badly, but they definitely represent the average player at a very minimum, given their experience to be playing this Beta.
---
I'm starting to think the real surprise may be that classic raiding isn't going to be as faceroll as everyone's been trying to claim it will be for the past year.
---
We will see.
---
There are better things in life than working for a district that doesn‚Äôt want you.
---
Yeah to be fair I havn't been in there in ages so would be lost as well.
---
Yeah some of us actually go for higher education.
---
I highly doubt I will, I only played from BC onward and I‚Äôm not a media personality. The only beta I got in was because I won a wowhead contest lol.
---
I have been on the Classic train since late Cata. It has been a long journey and now that we are here and I can't play, I act like a little girl whos daddy wont buy her a toy. I think my frustrations are somewhat valid but at the end of the day life isnt fair, lol
---
Well then he sucks at speed leveling.
---
I don‚Äôt quite understand the whole concept on speed leveling either, so maybe that‚Äôs a lost art form on me.
---
I love this style of art. Take your uptoot
---
No but at least we know more than 0%
---
lol, its just the only new content coming out. Gonna be streamers for a while.
---
&gt; bellend 
---
Had to look that up lol. You would think a streamer would clean up a little bit.
---
This explains it pretty well. 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Crushing_blow
---
Now this is the top google search. So with this thread he is helping many.
---
Theres a disable option
---
Don‚Äôt have to be a fan to appreciate the communication that‚Äôs going on in a low level dungeon. The need for CC and group coordination to clear stuff. 
---
This is some great stuff
---
Do you even read OP post? Way to miss the joke, Bro.
---
&lt;Did It For Whitney&gt; Is a multiple top 100 ranked US Guild over the course of WoWs history. We have our sights on Classic this time, and will be pushing for not only server dominance, but to maintain that top ranked mentality. If you want to divorce your wife, quit your job, and spend every waking minute improving yourself in the World... of Warcraft, this may be the home for you. We intend to roll on a PVP SERVER as HORDE. This is a NORTH AMERICAN EAST COAST Guild, so please keep that in mind when considering raid times/days. Our current raid times will be tues/wed/thurs 10:30pm EST until 1:30am EST. If you fill out an application and have more questions, please message either Jaythekilla (GM) or myself, Gloodizzle (CoGM) on Discord, and we will be happy to chat with you!
---
Jaythekilla#1129  
---
Gloodizzle#4473
---
There isn't many people playing so they just know where the rare/elite mobs are
---
It's called a crit for a reason, probably was like -10 under his defense cap for his level (which was common as skillups were much slower in Vanilla). So, not surprising when the boss had like a 4second swing timer (guessing).
---
What a fucking idiot. Good to know so i never watch him.
---
Dueling seems to be the politically correct term for camping in this case.
---
Sat on my dad's lap when I was 2 and ran around Durotar on his Orc Warrior, always explored on his characters and watched him quest and raid until I could actually level by myself. Been playing since, pretty sure it counts
---
Shamans are one of the few classes that had a specc that slays in PvP and can work just fine as a healer in raids too. You might need to specc full resto for progression times, but for the rest of the time just stay 30/0/21 people need their WF.
---
First guild I joined was mostly Americans with a few Canadians (and one guy from Turkey, oddly enough as we were an Eastern time NA server) and some of my guild mates convinced one of our Canadian members to name his next Tauren character as ‚ÄúCownadian‚Äù.
---
What are you talking about.
---
If so take your mana pots with you, youll need them after every single mob. Gl
---
24.4 Right now
---
It might be a lottery as well, works well to boost hype. He shall consider getting a ticket in Jackpot. ;)
---
You‚Äôve got to remember, wow wasn‚Äôt really finished in vanilla. Some classes or specs were just flat out broken. If you want to tank raids, warrior is your only option.
---
Oh, for sure. But you're still walking a thin line between fine speed and dead, considering you lack the options other classes have for avoiding or escaping bad situations. It may not be the slowest, but I do think it's the most dangerous which is what I tend to refer to for "hardness" of levelling.
---
I had the entire loot table of all raids in Vanilla memorized, now I can recall only a fraction of it, mostly the ones that were relevant to my class.  
---
There are things though that were incredibly inpactful for my enjoyment of the game that I remember more clearly than what I did a few days ago.  
---
Some examples of this:  
---
\- I know exactly on which spot I was when the AQ gate opened, I already went inside because you could obviously walk through gates and some walls. The server crashed and I was TPd back to the same spot on top of a hill and I constantly had Ice Barrier on.  
---
\- I remember the exact spot I was standing when I killed Ragnaros for the first time.  
---
\- I remember when I got my first horse mount, I went to the burning steppes to run around because I saw all the cool dragons from above. I was level 40 and mobs started to chase me and I died a lot. After some time a dwarf paladin named Kai who was already level 60 helped me kill some mobs.  
---
\- I remember exactly what items I was wearing at the end of Vanilla  
---
\- I remember names of some of my guild mates / people from the grp I pvped with and some conversations I had with them  
---
I have a decent long term memory or at least I think so, even though there are bunch of details that I forgot, but I think the time playing Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath were the most memorable in my life.
---
Welcome to the future, where instead of paying a mandatory hundred dollars a month to a cable provider you can opt to donate 5$ to some guy on the internet who you find entertaining and watch regularly. Horrible, I know.
---
Honestly it probably isn‚Äôt to bad to gear. You only compete with other shamans and hunters. Other shamans won‚Äôt want it. There‚Äôs only one or two hunters in a raid as well.
---
Wow imagine arguing about a friend group playing wow having stupid fun. While you sit at home watching their stream.  Pathetic neckbeards
---
I mean this is specifically a Sword progression list for rogues, as many will be playing combat swords and/or also playing human. [List of dagger progression can also be found here](https://i.imgur.com/A9tWlah.png), credits again to Kargoz
---
MrGm got invited but I'm not sure if its just because hes a streamer
---
\&gt;soupa soka
---
oh shit i forgot this guy existed (was subbed but didnt have notifications on), double thanks. and that's endearing
---
You shouldn't be able to in 5-man dungeons, but can in raids (as per a [blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic-updated/131586) months ago) which is a compromise between loot trading game-wide vs none at all.
---
Chill out man. Beta with friends.  
---
You are overreacting.
---
I suppose that is a difference of opinion. I think having multiple rare spawns, node spawns and the ability to move between layers is a pretty massive problem.
---
I don't think launch day issues are game-wide problems. They are very much temporary and could be solved other ways.
---
Human Mage, especially Frost spec.
---
Haha, think its just british slang for now, but yeah just that painful 'look at me' streamer behaviour urgh.
---
You‚Äôre not a doctor until tomorrow, Tyler.  
---
Kidding. But yeah same here. Started wow in 7th grade, took 2 years off after undergrad and have 1 year left of medical school.
---
30, and while I don't have a family, I've a very demanding job and huge family commitments. I keep telling myself I'll be hitting the game hard, but I just don't see it happening, try as I might. A casual raid scene would perfectly fit my schedule!
---
Damn, wish there was a way to minimize the Picture-in-Picture talking human in this video.
---
Frost mage can handle most 1v1s better then sl lock?
---
How‚Äôs it hard to believe someone who has almost zero vanilla knowledge and never played got lost in wc?
---
My imps name... Was also Fizkip...
---
World PVP, Dwarf Hunter? Hunters are strong 1v1 in the open world, and Dwarves can cleanse blinds and poisons with stoneform.
---
Honestly I don't know what, if any, utility human racials bring to PVP, anyone know any benefit?
---
but which one is more capable of finding bugs and giving useful feedback ? it doesn't even earn blizz money who wants to watch tips out
---
Warrior weapon
---
Oh for god sake shut up dude. He‚Äôs playing with his fucking friends having stupid fun. 
---
And yep don‚Äôt join his server because you‚Äôll definitely run into him all the time!! 
---
Grow up lmao
---
So, basically he's showing what happens could happen in a group with people you don't necessarily know/trust and that reputations will precede you. Blacklist that guy!
---
I don't mind Asmon, but it genuinely blows my mind, that he plays the way he plays after playing the damn game for 15 year and even makes his living from it.
---
sorry man didn't see it
---
Two. Two screens. One for the game, the other for Twitch/googling stuff/etc. If you're waiting for something, you can watch the second screen until the game is ready. Do you sit there and watch your character drink? Do you watch the entire time you're flying? If not, then a second screen wouldn't hurt.  
---
Rather than tabbing out to a browser hidden behind the game, it's right there on your second screen. Want to reference a screenshot or a guide? It's right there.  
---
&gt; At that point you're just wasting your own time with an excess amount of visual stimulation.  
---
How are you wasting time if the two things can happen SIMULTANEOUSLY? Yeah, when you're at a point in the game when it needs your attention, you tune the stream out, but for the rest of the time, you can pay attention when you want.
---
For the vast majority of time, WOW doesn't require a high cognitive load, so being able to watch a show/stream/or listen to a book is certainly viable.  
---
Why is it so difficult to understand? How can you say it "doesn't make sense"?  
---
Have you never listened to a book, or a podcast?  
---
Do you not even have music on while you're playing?
---
Yup, Soda viewers have nothing else to watch.
---
I watched him for the first 12 hours, there is enough variation from private that his route was turfed pretty damn quick. He was in full improv by level 10. HE managed to recovered a bit when he knocked off ashenvale 12-15 but it's not the same and the prep only carries you so far.
---
He is also a moderator here and on the Classic Discord. :)

Ive never seen someone say hunter is better then mage at any form of pvp. Also take into account i also like ngs &amp; will raid of course.
---
19 is more than fine for WC.
---
Did you even play classic?
---
Thanks dude
---
Frost Mage can handle fucking anything. Go watch some old Vurtne videos.
---
And 1v1s in BGs/world PvP are far less common than one suspects. Gotta prepare for group fighting as well.
---
not sure if he's trying to be a DrDisrespect-like, or just a natural moron.
---
Looks like omnicc to me.
---
Cant go wrong with any of these if you ask me.
---
Wow you tell them man!
---
I‚Äôm so glad knowing that the almighty neckbeards can guide them through WC and post on reddit how much they hate streamers for having fun
---
All I'll say is I'm glad I'm rolling Horde this time.
---
if they want more feedback they will invite more people, i think its that simple. inviting all streamers is economically smart, free advertisement and building some hype first, also a lot of those viewers maybe see something wrong and write it in the feedback forums.
---
hope people like joana get a key soon, for they are far more valuable for testing than most of the other guys. but 5k guys at once? uuh not sure about that tbh
---
Good to know!
---
I mean I was incredibly young I was 3 I'm in grade 12 now but I do know that I used to play with my dad when I was little granted I don't really remember anything but still
---
over 100 days
---
Are you upset because they make a living of having fun and playing a game? While you probably live off your parents still?
---
There is far too many variables for this. What faction? What raid? What boss? What goals does your guild have? Its really hard to answer this question.
---
Mish'undare never get one üò≠
---
Posting private server stuff here now that there's legit servers?
---
For shame.
---
It was not asked to me, but he thinks he is a god.. Constantly yelling NO WIPE, NO WIPE it's really annoying. And he get all the gear he wants, the others don't have anything to say in it.. I just wait and play over 3 months.
---
buggy like it was back in the day lmao #nochanges. I am okay with buggy ai or UI. As long as their is no exploits I will deal with it
---
I graduated at age 29
---
I fucked off my youth playing WoW.... I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one
---
Hey...it takes forever to get a PhD ;). Started in eight grade, defending my dissertation next month.
---
Oh really? Sry i did not think about this. Just a normal guild, not speedruns or something like that. And horde
---
Agreed, how pathetic lmao. So salty that these guys have fun and make a living out of it, while they complain on reddit
---
The only part I'm gonna reply to since we've already discussed the others several times is the part about other 60's pouring in. A lot of the time this isn't true. Heck look at retail, even with people with Warzone flagged on, half the people don't do anything, you type in /1 and /3 and people either ignore you, respond git gud or do something else, or you get a fraction of people to help and now they are trapped as well. 
---
If people really did do the whole war thing, pvp would be more fun.
---
Opened this thread to ask the same thing, and here it is, the first question...
---
I'm in the exact same position.  Well almost exact.  But 9pm pst will be my hopeful guild raid time.
---
Exactly. People who play wow also really love education.
---
I'll take that over terrible, unfunny memes
---
They have a working vanilla client that they are comparing everything too. The beta (and classic) are both running off of the BfA client.
---
They have access to all of the original numbers, how would pservers be more accurate?
---
Joanas has for some classes but not all and joanas are faster and more efficient
---
Oh you're one of those
---
I am actually still in school now but its for re-training. You got me i guess
---
I think part of it must be that he's key binding things on the fly, and from watching earlier he tried to bind a couple of things to the same keys as when he played years ago.
---
He doesn't have the same issue with clicking or anything when he plays retail. At least from when I've watched him before.
---
You'll be flagged in redridge &amp; if you roll pve because you have no spine then v0v
---
Alright so I was 23 when classic originally came out. I've alerted the wife and kids that this is happening and set it up so they have an awesome trip to a beach house for that week, clearing out all the bedroom, office and living room space necessary to fit all five of us mouthbreathers.
---
No minmaxing required here. Planning on playing a shadow priest, and I don't have enough friends planning on playing Classic to know if I'll ever get that coveted raid slot. I'm gonna do my best to be a nuisance in world PvP so that I can fish in Stranglethorn forever and scare people away from all my fishing spots.
---
Yup, less than a third of a year. Super close
---
I have no idea but I hope so
---
And now we‚Äôre just comparing Mercedes to a Lexus. At the end of the day, they are achieving the same thing at a high quality.
---
Regardless, neither of them made the beta.
---
($15 a month adds up).   
---
Get a job, buy a nice PC.   
---
Had mine for 5 years now. Still runs everything great.
---
We'll be able to secure names 14 days early? How's that?
---
Chances are they will issue more false reports that correct ones, and just watching Tipsout for an hour proved me correct.
---
Go watch Perplexity and his crew do real Beta.
---
They have divided asset folders in your WoW folder into Live and Classic, thus use the same client and the addons will most likely work. Keep in mind that the classic team will disable a lot of addon features to preserve authenticity.
---
Loot leads to drama, doesn't much matter how its handed out
---
And I know its anecdotal but I've seen more corrupt dkp guilds than lc guilds. Its pretty easy to give your buddy +100 dkp here or there and claim they donated to the gbank or something if anyone questions it.
---
There is some weird hateboner towards all streamers on this sub and they try saying things like oh we are to old we are 30 when alot streamers are 30 or pushing it
---
Easiest to just link you this then
---
i always did redridge AFTER duskwood...   o.o
---
People who give a shit enough to come prepared and the pre raid gear they need
---
As someone not well versed in Vanilla, what are all the meme specs so I can avoid them? I‚Äôve played Shadow Priest in retail and have mainly seen ‚Äúyou only need 1‚Äù in Vanilla.
---
Because after there wouldn't be hundreds of people all questing in the same area. That is because people will level at all different paces and zones will start to even out. Also yes, some people will stop playing the game all together for many different reasons. The amount of people playing this at lauch and probably at least a couple weeks after launch is probably going to be insane in comparison to when the game first launched back in the day.
---
It did show up late vanilla.
---
Oh my god you genius. I'm stealing this for my future life when I live with my girlfriend and want to have a week long LAN for certain releases.
---
We're all old men now with families and kids, but for one beautiful week we are going to recapture the glory days.
---
No, random russian servers are not closer than Blizzard
---
lmao imagine having this kind of meltdown over some cringelord playing 15 years old game hahaha
---
MONEY. if they werent getting paid for streaming they wouldn't care less.
---
Why wouldn't it be south shore again?
---
They stack &gt;:) welcome to best warrior race and loktar ogar to you, friend &gt;:)
---
haha right, whats wrong with people
---
Pretty sure it does without diminishing returns
---
I've got a job, car, etc just no need for an actual cpu anymore, it's been years since I had one.  I use ps4 for games, tablets for most other stuff and my needs are met just fine.  I'm literally getting a tower just for Classic so no point in getting some badass gaming cpu.
---
LMFAO, is this real?
---
You might hate to hear this but gnome mage is built for pvp
---
Shadow spec is tough to say, if you have 2-3 nicely geared warlocks it might be justified but even then it's hard to say. If you are a priest 99.99999% chance you will heal for all of WoW Classic. 
---
Shadow/Ret/Elem/Enchance/Feral/Bear are basically pushed by private server kids that never played vanilla.
---
Dungeon end-boss, and the tank pulls while everyone else is looting. Then he reads chat and the healer DPS's. That should always be a wipe.
---
who?
---
Which is honestly a weird way to do it since it is almost entirely client side work. Have a flag on the server that tells the client the weather in a given zone, then have the client display the weather effect for any player in that zone. Why bother with rendering things server side at all?
---
They're probably used to private servers. The time I tried playing on a private server it had weather effects active like over 50% of the time.
---
Theyre pulling 4 non-elite bandits.. stop saying stupid things
---
This looks like if the front of your character can see even a small bit of a target's "circle" (think clicking on them and seeing the circle around the taret), it counts as eligible. And since that edge of the circle is on the backside of him, it is eligible for backstabs.
---
They'll likely have to change it so you can see the center of the circle instead of the edge before making attacks eligible. In [this](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/WealthyNiceCrabsChocolateRain?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) clip, it wasn't working at first until he was farther in the mage's circle.
---
Interesting!
---
I love that the game isn't even out yet and the level of drama is off the charts
---
I seriously doubt it will play the game. That's a bad, bad PC dude.
---
You must work at GameStop
---
Why so negative?    
---
Actually he doesn't pull more than 2 elites at once.
---
A bit late but really helpful video. Keep doing these!
---
Reddit geniuses at work.
---
I can't tell if people are just this stupid or if theyre going for clickbait.
---
They are also pretty high level, deadmines starts easy (low level mobs) and ends hard (high level mobs). It does seem sorta easy but they are all 19+ and decked out in full greens
---
No ok I guess that once one layer fills up then a new one spawns and yea it will have less than 3k at the start. My argument still stands
---
OH MY GOD IT LOOKS SO EASY I REMEMBERED IT DIFFERENTLY!!!!!  
---
ALSO ON PRIVATE SERVER IT WAS SO MUCH HARDER OMG BLIZZ PLS DONT RUIN CLASSIC  
---
ALSO PLS DELETE COLORBLIND MODE BLIZZ
---
This sub is full of kids who hate streamers for some weird reason, some people are having meltdowns over some clips lol
---
but where are you gunna masterbate....
---
And if that's not enough, just go pick up a Krol Blade from the auction house...
---
He bug reports "THERE IS NO WATER IN DEADMINES LOL". 
---
This guy....
---
This is how it was on the PVP server when I played.  Not sure about PVE but for PVP it goes your faction zone = green, enemy faction = red, contested was a darker yellowish color like you stated.
---
Posts like these give me an aneurysm
---
"If people really did do the whole war thing, pvp would be more fun." I can not speak for what happened a vast majority of the time but, my experience on stormreaver US. was it led to war. This may be different on a different server. Without the "war breaking out" aspect. I would not gank as it's pretty boring.
---
I just went looking for the cheapest shit amazon has lol.  I have no desire to own a cpu and haven't in years, but want to play Classic again so I'm looking for literally the absolute cheapest bare bones thing just to run it.   I'm not kidding in that wow would be the only single program on the damn thing.
---
After careful consideration of my post I withdraw my opinion and will not make any bad comments about Blizzard Entertainment or any of their affiliates. Lets get hyped for a Classic SUmmer
---
I just don't get it. I'm not saying he needs to drop 50 pounds and look like a model but dude... Comb your beard.
---
No Water in Deadmines LOL
---
Well there wasn't any
---
Fucking a single private server has higher populations than 5-20k, LMFAO
---

No it wasn't. Flying wasn't expected until level 70 at the latest due to how expensive it was. The leveling experience isn't built for flying. Only some level 70+ areas are built for flying. Tempest keep, some floating islands, impassable mountains...all can be edited with a teleport/flightpoint, a bridge, or a tunnel. Please give any other examples where the map is built for flying.

Sure but if you want to level a non-night-elf in Darnassus area you gotta run the gauntlet thru there. I did it back in the day wanted to level a human among the elves.
---
It seems like you could super easily add a "see base gear instead of transmogs" checkbox in the options menu somewhere that would solve the one big complaint people have about them.
---
It is an analysis from private server data
---
&gt;I'm not a fan of twitch at all
---
What‚Äôs wrong with twitch? Normal (sometimes slightly narcissistic) people recording themselves playing video games. Hard to have a non-neutral opinion on it.
---
But that is your freaking bug report? Like... is he trying to be funny? Because he is failing if that's what he is doing.
---
funny because people who watch streamers are little kids.
---
&gt;Random Question about Boss Length
---
Well I guess you could ask them or check after you kill them
---
saying NO WIPE is a meme because he made a bet with chat that if he wipes he will donate 50 gifted subs to chat, its a joke man you should relax a bit.
---
Also i've watched his entire Classic progress and him being a loot hoarder is absolutely not the case, he's always asked if Esfand wants the good mail gear that drops, and anything he doesn't need he has been passing on, not even greeding.
---
I think you guys just hate on asmon to hate him.
---
Not really, just buy loads and never let yourself run below so many stacks. If you fill up a quiver every time you're in town you'll be fine.
---
And people are complaining about UI bugs.
---
reminder the game was out for about a year before they introduced BG's so in his current date he'd probably been playing for several months or a year. So he had plenty of time to perfect his UI/macros etc.
---
Ah, so one has to have been playing since 04 to be allowed streaming or to play classic at all?
---
Everyone got R14 but only a small % could reach it on each server.
---
Same shit :D
---
Okay thanks it‚Äôs nice to have some assurance
---
Well if layer 2 opens with 500 people then you now have 200% resources for 116% people. It is still severely unbalanced.
---
Remember this is what made wow the biggest MMO
---
im 36, i have a company, work like 70 hours a week and i like streams. Guess ima little kid.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure why everyone was losing their mind of people asking about that. It wasn‚Äôt absolutely clear. I mean it sounded like you would have to get an active sub to get invited, but  the way it was worded it wasn‚Äôt 100% clear.
---
Get in a group of 5, socialize and fight higher level mobs outside of the starting area. Do a little bit of exploring for exp and flightpoints. Within 30 minutes players will be spread out enough for consistent mob-grinding. Certain quests should be straight up avoided and you should grind.
---
Well to be fair only at M+ levels that most people aren't even doing.
---
You said on average, the implication being the international average. Don't play dumb you fucking yank.
---
a masochist? probably.
---
Stock up before an instance and you'll be fine. You're going to have stacks of 200 in quivers about 8 - 12 slots in size early on, so it's not as bad as it sounds.
---
No. it's not really that much of an issue, as far as i remember there was type of bag that allows to hold plenty of ammo. Sure you'll have to keep in mind to restock before dungeons, but thats about it.
---
Just refill every time you go back to town, that's what I did back in the day and I never ran out.
---
Glad I could help!
---
Pservers do not use the same build as classic wow, mate.
---
You should work on whatever has your panties twisted up. Bottling up feelings isn't a healthy way to cope with them.
---
Back then everything had to be uniform for sky boxes
---
Brb buying blizz stonks
---
It will peak at a few million at first and die down to maybe a million? I could be way off but thats my guess
---
classic is full of "inconveniences", which in time turn to flavor. i love to "have to" restock ammo once in a while!
---
i see classic more like ab online realtime dungeons&amp;dragons if that makes sense.
---
Yep, right before combat.
---
Never had any loot drama in my guild. You only received dkp for attending on time, every hour of raiding, and every boss kill. There was a hard cap to how much one could bid so new raiders would be given a chance to roll on loot and veterans had more opportunities.
---
\&gt;since I dont know if my spoken english is good enough for voicechats.     
---
It's a good way to learn :P
---
I didn't know L\_duo2 was the arbiter of all that is humor and decides what is or isn't funny.
---
Did they forget to open Smite's chest?
---
in MC? fairly short, 1-3 minutes per boss max. BWL , meh cant remember
---
A swing and a miss, pal.
---
There is a guild floating around called Working Adults and their name says it all.  You should try and seek them out
---
Gravity, it got you.
---
Tipps is a legit dbag. I've had a healthy disdain for him since I saw his first video. No idea why he gets the love that he does for his garbage "content" .
---
And now you do.
---
I'm hoping they'll take the approach of adding more content with Naxx as the max power level. For example, adding a grim batol 40 man raid thats at least as difficult as Naxx but drops the same quality of gear. I would also like to see more content while leveling.
---
WHAT ABOUT CLASS BALANCE, GUYS? I WANT TO PLAY A BOOMKIN!!!
---
ALSO, CAN I HAS DUAL SPEC PLZ
---
I am erect
---
just make sure you stock on up extra anytime youre in a city or near an arrow vendor and youll never need to worry about it
---
very many players will roll on english servers that have worse english skills than you have, i promise! :)  
---
And you will be getting better in no time (its actually quite amazing how fast one is getting better at speaking a language when hes speaking it constantly)
---
If you haven't done Wailing Caverns with a hunter who runs out of arrows, food, or both, you haven't lived.
---
You serious?
---
So after dying down you expect a population about 50x higher than the retail players high estimate. Sounds about right.
---
#Just a heads up:
---
**Kargoz refuses to update his guides to take into account p-server bugs that were well known to not exist in Classic. Take with a grain of salt!!!!**
---
Ty dude, Ill try this build 31/10/10 to fight rogues.
---
yeah simple
---
do you have a source for this?
---
Excellent. Ty
---
I would have been very upset if they had updated the graphics without giving us the option of keeping them how they used to be. I don't like how modern wow looks but I loved vanilla graphics.
---
But they give us the option, so I'm fine with it.
---
Tweaked != Same
---
Can we join that stress test later without a sub?
---
I agree completely, I think OP's suggesting on layering specifically because it's something the devs are going to do regardless
---
ehhh the principal stands. A mage should focus more on intellect and spell damage and care less about the other stats on a weapon.
---
its the 1.12 2006 version what did you think you will get? You get easy mode, its been defended and hyped with no end.
---
Every server needs an Angwe or two!
---
What are pros and cons for alchemy + herbalism vs. skinning + leatherworking for a rogue in classic?
---
Aside from herbalism for making thistle tea and alchemy saving and making good money.
---
I'm really saddened by that HUGE negativity surrounding the lanuch of Classic wow.    
---
New players (retail) are bitching that the servers will SURELY die within few months, while veterans complain that not exactly everything is the same as in vanilla.    
---
Meanwhile I'm watching some streams and really like what I see.
---
Mine was super similar, I think it was Cahlos
---
probably a manchild or something
---
Friends forced me into alliance when we started in vanilla beta and that lasted till we all quit in WotLK. This time around we are doing it right! For the Horde!
---
I'm no expert on vanilla pvp specs, but orc warrior is a known rogue slayer. Great rogues will still get you, but if you have a pocket healer and protect them, no rogue can ever stop you.
---
ideal raid comp is about 8 healers and 32 fury warriors. but if youre just looking to get through content you can take pretty much anything and youll be fine (to an extent)
---
Tanks are absolutely a bunch of fucking divas. They can and will kick people if they don't shape up after being told do.
---
Source: I'm a diva tank.
---
It shouldn't work any differently. Mobs on live still evade like that when they cant reach you, and that cannon should still be a separate object. Maybe someone with beta can try it out and see.
---
Okay so again this is worth reiterating: you're making up exploits. The system isn't out yet.
---
And what other solutions do you have for overcrowding at launch? I'd love to hear them.
---
Well you won't want Hunter gear since it's agility though. Vanilla enhancement is Str
---
The night is dark and full of terrors
---
He whined about it? I only saw him posting about it being there
---
Ya well their estimate isnt even what I would call an estimate. Their estimate is brain-dead at best. I think there is a chance that Classic ends up with the same amount of active players as current retail wow does.
---
I'm exact age and spot in my life, I'm sure gonna try. Just find a good group of people I'm sure there are alot of us out there. We're gonna be putting a group together or joining one. Unsure.
---
You're such a pro, bruh.   
---
We're like totally in awe of you.
---
idk I did 1-60 on nostalrius in 10 or 11 days played idk if thats fast or not, I think its average.
---
That's activision
---
Many many people will have a lot of fun. That‚Äôs what matters.
---
If having money, working and having a fun life is being a man child sign me up!
---
There isn't a server for my language. So enjoy my slavic accent
---
No you can accurately say without /sit bug fury is losing the 25% improved damage per swing.
---
Did I say it wasn't fine for WC?  I was just providing more information for why he died so fast.  The mob he was tanking was 2 levels higher than him.
---
"Did you even play classic?" lol.  I was a legitimate no lifer, guild leader and raid leader, since the original beta and I know the game just about inside and out, probably much better than you.  Take your misplaced elitism and shove it up your ass.
---
Is there a difference nowadays?
---
Which ever one you want to look at for a long period of time.
---
You must be ready to use more than enhancement capabilities of your class. In some fights you will just have to heal (like on Rag your mana bar can't get near other melees). With nightfall that would be quite "meta ok". Outside of it even though enhancement isn't anything groudbreaking - consistency and being a cool guy is what it counts.
---
As for time - you don't need much. I'm in  a guild that initially was a leveling guild and we have 2 raid nights that are 3h. One for current raid second for old tier cleanup. Plus AQ20 and ZG "as it goes". And on top of that not every class / build is heavily dependent on gear - Naxx may have most stat values but you often don't need that high of a gear to have a blast in the game (and the raids compared to retail aren't the only end game content) - wherever pummeling some mobs really hard or fishing.
---
Barrens is Horde territory, there was never really PvP there unless a level 60 raid went for Crossroads...
---
https://youtu.be/ByFhCalvSns it did.
---
When I was 16 back in Vanilla most the people I raided with were in their 30s and 40s. Just saying.
---
You're the one that came in here crying that not everyone likes your favourite streamer and wont spam Poggers with you.
---
Thats whats important
---
Sadly, no
---
..Okay
---
&gt; Blizzard is just trying to avoid spending money - which is why I don't trust the classic team yet. Because they are clearly making decisions to avoid spending money. 
---
Again, be fucking ashamed of yourself. How. Many. Times. Has the classic team given us what we want?

I know someone in the beta. He says it seems easier to level than on private servers.
---
Hi, /u/lilweepx
---
Birfdays was the worst days
---
Rofl I love their guild name
---
Good to know
---
to be honest classic could post record sub numbers for blizzard, and is going to blow the current sub count out of the water (estimated between 1-2 million.) personally i see it being around atleast 5-7 million people at launch
---
It's not the DPS' job to do the healer's job-- and that includes watching the healers' mana or making sure he's healing and not DPSing.  Period, the end.  Muted.
---
I love seeing the rain last for more than 10 seconds. Weather effects in retail are just blah.
---
Insert "Millennials ruining our country"-esque statement
---
Im going back to finish my undergrad at 27. Wish me luck. I worked really hard to make sure I'll have it paid off though the GI Bill
---
Honestly, skill has some bit to do with it.
---
Give me a warrior and i will destroy all 3 of these pretty consistently.
---
But give me a druid and id probably get my face stomped on by anything.
---
However, MAGE is my all time favorite class for pvp in terms of FUN...even if i die..i still sheeped you once lol. 
---
Rogue is probably the easiest class for pvp though.
---
Osrs has what, 500k? That sounds doable for classic over the 6 phases. After that is a different topic. I don't really care, as long as I have one server I'll be happy.
---
It honestly doesn't. I ran Deadmines so much back in the day because I made a lot of alts. Me and my mates were like 12-13 years old and we sucked and Deadmines was never hard.
---
Yikes ooof cringe oh you sweet summer child
---
Me and about 10 of my friends will be starting up a casual guild in Vanilla. We're all gonna take off of work for the first few days of Vanilla but after that we will all just level and have fun at our own pace, no rushing.
---
you just gave them. there is level 70 only content that required flying mounts. also, several maps are vertical with bridges, (e.g. nagrand, dragonspike area) wherr flying is a huge advantage. it's not as simple as "just doing some tunnels".
---
also, yes it was designed with flying moubts in mind
---
This was common knowledge back in vanilla (your rogues would be gkicked if they tried to expose armor in a raid lol) I don't know why it was such a controversial thing on pservers for so long.
---
SHAME!!!
---
staysafe was saying its taken him an extra \~5 hours to hit lvl 14, i think it was lvl 14 atleast. he said on private servers his time was about 9.5 hours to hit whatever level it was that he mentioned, and on the beta it took him over 14 hours to hit the same level
---
Did u not read the blue post...?
---
Played when I was 10-12 so don‚Äôt remember much. Just remember my bear attacking me and ‚Äútraveling‚Äù
---
Thanks. Any idea why druid are picked less than the others?
---
Man, Tips is a fucking clown.  I love knowing that my private server experience is going to shoot me far ahead of him when real classic drops.  I just wish he had to learn then instead of now, months in advance
---
It‚Äôs a sign
---
The average age was 28 back then, and a whole lot of players were older than that and glad to see their early PC gaming in Warcraft, MMOs like Dark Age of Camelot and even pen and pencil D&amp;D jump into life.
---
Stands to reason we will have lots of gamers around 50 playing who now have ages to play since their kids have grown up...and that is a great thing.
---
This one of those examples of why more people should be in the beta. There is a lot of shit to test, even in the 1-30 range. Well see what happens but I remember 2 manning the entirety of Deadmines as rogue / priest. We were level 18 or so and in full greens with some enchants. These guys are 19 and in full greens, I think its fine personally but would need to test it myself to find out
---
Ditto, this is dope.
---
so the sunder armor would be stronger on max stacks but they couldnt reach maxstacks cause the couldnt be applied?
---
It‚Äôs always worked that way
---
At least wrath babies leveled up the hard way, pre-Cata nerfs.
---
You can create and name 3 characters on 13th August if you got an account
---
Look at you having a meltdown now too lol.
---
I'm not really sure.  Something about Asmongold specifically really polarizes people.
---
It's really the boss girth you have to worry about.
---
most of them use some code from TBC or even WotLK. A good example being warriors using /sit to proc, which can be done on most private servers, but couldn't be in vanilla, and can't in Classic
---
Biggest let down is how slow PvP is now.
---
Seems like damage is 1/4 of what it was in BC and 1/8 of what it was in WOTLK
---
its impossible to tell
---
when 90% of content creators are playing classic i dont think we can even guess how many people will try it
---
if everyone is positive and the experience is good at least like fortnite or pugb numbers of people could try the game
---
now obviously most of them wont ever make it past 40 but even with a shit retention percentage that would be a lot of people
---
28 year old here, I played when I was 14. I also went to college at 19, dropped out because I couldn't get student loan funding. Worked for a few years.
---
Went back at 2 and dropped out because I had no idea what I wanted to do. Then worked for a few years.
---
Went back at 24, finished my degree taking courses part time in the last year, and graduating next week.
---
I'm looking forward to playing Classic WoW for a few weeks when it launches. Those early days when the community was fresh and people were exploring the world and engaging with one another were fantastic.
---
Literally just butthurt they didn't get in beta.
---
I want one but for tanks :C with secondary options also for shield.
---
Yeah same for Dal Rends
---
well, your standard is very high for players who have concerns about regen speed, I assumed you would hold yourself to the same.
---
&gt; Because they are clearly making decisions to avoid spending money. 
---
LOL fucking SOURCE? Get your head out of your ass and have some fucking shame. AGAIN I ask you, how many times does the classic team have to prove themselves?
---
Blizzard also realised we ‚Äúneeded‚Äù raid finder and sharding and look where that got us.
---
Wow, haha, I would never have imagined that was possible. I remember wiping endlessly on my server with a full group.
---
30 years old. Always have a random stream up or let's play on second monitor when I play. When I'm not watching the news that is
---
I'm just saying random words like you lol.
---
Now I'm just hoping these influential streamers don't somehow get blizzard to make things easier
---
They are only really "good" as a healer and even then the other healers are better.
---
&gt;world first lvl 30 on an invite only beta
---
World of OrcCraft
---
Wow dude you're being so toxic for having actual reasons and logic as your defense. With all this aggressive Classic toxicity, I'm not sure if I can even get through level 10!
---
Oh boy, if you think that's inconvenient wait til you do nefarian on a hunter
---
Interesting, I guess everyone had a different experience. I think maybe people were just bad on my server then.
---
I thought they were good offtanks.
---
First line: An¬†order of magnitude¬†is an approximate measure of the number of digits that a number has in the commonly-used¬†base-ten number system.
---
Climb mountains from Dun Morogh, jump down and die, spawn at wetlands GY - at menethil with little to no risk in about 10 mins of spawning at gnome/ dwarf start place.
---
Don‚Äôt remember if this is actually in vanilla but it definitely worked on pservers
---
You will not have to choose between preparation/report writing/marking and playing at least.
---
I dont know whether to say "F" or "congrats"
---
Exactly, him acting like that on beta makes it even worse, it doesn't excuse him
---
&gt; It sounds like a practical change. Vanilla WoW probably didn't have the massive onslaught of players that Classic will on launch. 
---
lol. spoken as someone who didn't play launch.
---
Ah, gotcha. I tend to think of difficulty being related to time on WoW so I guess I misinterpreted your first post.
---
I wish I was still in law school. Could have played all day and night till just before finals. Now I just think, "that doesn't sound billable."
---
Expose armor can actually be stronger than 5 stack sunder if talented and used at max combo points.
---
Clearly you are full of bullshit and have zero clue..
---
Blue post with known bugs already states the &lt;random enchantment&gt; as a bug players will encounter currently
---
For horde you have to reserve a lot of healing spots for shamans for their totems.  At the same time you want a certain amount of priests because they are the most versatile healers.  This leave only 1 or 2 spots left for druid healers.
---
I would say there isn't a problem with him using it in that context.
---
Are you sure you know what it means?
---
VanCleef gave us many many problems but we for sure did it. Deadmines was remember as hard because people when in at 16 or so, the final boss is 21. If you go in and your group is all 19+ in full greens, it will be easy.
---
lol why is this dude intentionally ruining his reputation
---
They destroyed Thousand needles/shimmering flats, one of the best Horde zones . . for some meme boat expedition bullshit that everyone hated.
---
I thought druids were picked for offtanking
---
Some people have said so but there is no real way for them to prove it.
---
[TL;DR Blizzard is in a world of hurt.](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/woody-harrelson-zombieland-money-cry-gif.gif?w=650)
---
I just don't see the logic behind the assertion it was ambiguous.
---
Just imagine how many dead accounts there are. Even if you go by accounts with a long sub history there will be more dead accounts than live ones. Makes no sense to include them...
---
Thus, it stands to reason only active subs would get invites. Had the beta been *larger* then maybe it would have made sense to invite dead accounts as well.
---
Eh, they're pretty easy if people pay attention and you're appropriate levels. You DEFINITELY don't need to be heal or tank spec for dungeons, especially leveling dungeons. I played warrior from a few months after launch till nax release, I eventually went prot for guild needs in AQ but I don't think i ran a single dungeon as prot.... and I ran tons of dungeons as the tank.
---
If they did daily waves until stress test, I would be very pleased.
---
&gt; Why on Earth would someone be against this?
---
The players on this forum are kind of all over the place when it comes to what they want and what they don't want. 
---
New models? People are 100% against it. No changes from what I've seen here. Which is odd. That in ***no way*** changes anything about the game. 
---
New content? Most people seem to be for it. They want new content to be added to the game (aside from TBC, or Wrath, etc). Which is odd, because that directly changes how the game would be played, right? Because of gear options and trinkets potentially changing how a character performs. So...no changes except certain ones? 
---
Character selection screen arrangement? A change that people want, or a change that people don't want? 
---
Based off what I've seen it would be near impossible to tell. People's opinions of what they want and don't want seem schizophrenic with almost no consistency. 
---
That makes it hard for the developers to know what people want.
---
stop basing it on private servers. maybei now you will understand that  private servers are overtuned and not easyer then retail vanilla
---
"You think you do . . but you don't"
---
/u/OrderOfThePenis is always full of juicy info
---
lvl30 in a day sounds so freaky. It took me some 2 months to get to 60 when it first came out.
---
I hope people will not do this when the game comes out, though. The leveling experience is amazing if you give it a shot and you're cheating yourself out of a cool experience by rushing through it with a guide.
---
Except Classic was never intended or marketed as a remake like WC3 Reforged, or even a remaster like SC2, well, Remastered. It was to be an opportunity to revisit Azeroth as close to what it once was as possible, within reason. An alternative to pservers, in other words.
---
I know it sounds crazy, but defining, coding, testing and deploying features is a complicated and time-consuming process. Why would they bother with all that, only to deliver something that's likely to piss off their target audience? If they're going to put resources into all the latest and greatest features, isn't it far more sensible to do it in the version of the game that's not called CLASSIC?
---
People complaining about dungeon difficulty is what ruined them.
---
it's not. they're level 19-20 and they're (somewhat) coordinated.
---
If you haven't been manually added by blizzard you need an active sub.
---
Yea Money is tight atm so don't want to have waste a sub unless I'm guaranteed to be participating in the beta.
---
Oh he definitely is. We all remember him crying and begging for money, right?
---
When did this guy get so big lol. I remember when he got 3k tops

I think the first MMO I played was EQ2 in 2001. I was 7. When FFXI dropped 17 years ago today my older brother picked it up; I had just turned 8. I started playing WoW when I was 10. 
---
I finished my bachelors last may. I know lots of people my age and older still in school. It's not a weird statement at all.
---
Shitty meme is shitty.
---
Their estimate is just incredibly low, especially considering you get the game for free if you have retail.
---
Am i the only one who was silly enough to do a one-month resub just for a chance in the beta lottery?
---
&gt; And they're rewriting a leigon client
---
But, they aren't.  They're conforming the 1.12 data to fit the structure of the current game client.  Brian Birmingham explained this in the BlizzCon 2018 "Restoring History" panel on Classic.
---
Vanilla is much more of an RPG than retail.  That means training skills, buying ammunition, leveling weapon skills, picking talents, procuring reagents for certain spells, etc.
---
If you want to play vanilla, you should embrace these things instead of fearing them.
---
i wonder how much money he made from this sub train
---
No, they don't. Stop.
---
It was possible in WoD.
---
Too busy having fun with the game to min/max!

My goal is to reach 60 before november. I will spend time picking flowers, brewing potions, doing as many dungeons as i can and quite possibly level with arms spec (atleast after level 40). Most day's, I'll be a sensible adult, some day's I'll be 15 year old me again, playing all day and night, realizing I should have gotten something to eat seven hours ago.
---
He's not saying that at all? He's saying he isn't surprised by the actions of someone who has painted themselves as a "vanilla expert" by only having played private servers after classic wow was announced. 
---
He can stream all he wants but for a "vanilla expert" to act like he is, it's a joke. and I don't really care about the deleting + sending VOD, I'm talking about all the false information he's reporting like bosses hitting too hard and quest arrows.
---
There aren't Beta keys. You gotta go into the Blizzard launcher and look under World of Warcraft regions. If you got into the beta (signed-up for WoW Classic beta on the website [different from WoW Beta] &amp; have an active subscription) if will be listed there as its own standalone. 
---
You probably already know all of this, just wanted to be sure. :-)
---
hehe, remember this post you made?
---
The guy literally acts like hes the only player that has played pserver. Earlier he said asmongold would have never have hit 18 without him
---
I am, no more Horde stuff for me.
---
Hi, /u/Maximmus17
---
This would make me so happy.
---
That's 100.000 viewers...
---
I wouldn't not roll shaman, druid, priest, or pally if you don't like to heal.
---
pretty much if you have a healing tree, people will expect you to heal.
---
you might find a raid that will take you if you buy/craft a nightfall just so you make the casters hit harder and in that case you are taking imp enh totems and imp weap totems so you might have some utility.  Even then, if a weapon upgrade drops for you, you probably aren't going to get it ahead of others.
---
enhancement in my opinion is the worst of the 3 shaman specs and it isn't that hard to get an off set elemental gear while you heal people in dungeons/raids.  If you really want to one shot people in PvP and have really high bursting damage, ele is superior to enh.  PvP gear/ZG and AQ gear/tier 0.5 gear all very supportive of ele spec.  most of the mail gear that would benefit enhancement shaman will go to a fury warrior or hunter before you.  But ele has mana problems and bring zero utility to the raid so they are not welcome in pve progression.  
---
Things get a bit easier if you get through AQ40 and have your full T2.5 gear as it seems to support any spec you want
---
Alright good luck bro
---
This is what happens when you have a coordinated group, it's not that hard, it' s a lv 20 dungeon.
---
VC at 18-19 is easy so long as you don't get snagged by pats, a lot of the difficulty I remember from it was because people would run it at 15.
---
Glorious tauren master race.
---
He tank. He stun. But most importantly, he kind.
---
Never met a tauren player with a bad attitude in the old days, Mulgore acts as a filter because it takes so damn long compared to most starting zones. Only the chill and patient get through. Except tauren druids since that was the only way to be a horde druid back in the day.
---
Isn't Asmon meant to be like a mythic raider? Why does he click half his skills and forget to battleshout and never uses charge?   
---
Deadmines is literally the first instance in the game on Alliance side, in a MMO that broke ground for being casual and intuitive. It's hard if you have no idea what you're doing and are under-levelled. It's very easy if you've been playing the game for 15 years and know what you're doing. How is this surprising to people.
---
Alright, I'm not a big fan of streamers but the response to killing VanCleef is insane and heartwarming. For all the naysayers of classic this kind of reaction should make them rethink their stance.
---
Apparently he even lied about playing vanilla while there was evidence he admitted he started in cata
---
Why do I hate it? I don't care at all. OP was the one who said he refuses to play Gnomes, and of his three options, Human Mage is the best choice imo.
---
Saw someone get one like 2 hours ago, like they're going out pretty sporadically
---
No, Deadmines was super easy in Vanilla. I used to tank it on my Rogue-alt, because it was so hard to find tanks. 
---
Only times Deadmines was somewhat hard was when the group was underlevel'd. (all at ~lvl15). If you go with people at around lvl20 it is a very easy instance.
---
still hope for me }:
---
Has anyone gotten an Invite to Beta without an active Subscription? (I know you need a sub to play the Beta)
---
&gt; for himself. 
---
&gt; if he brings a friend.
---
Omg the chat is going crazy.. Classic has a place on this earth 100k viewers!
---
Yes, it does seem that they are rolling out more invites as time goes on
---
I swear people need to understand that these words are synonymous.
---
Asmongold a mythic raider? LMAO
---
No, I don't hate him. Annoying and hate are 2 different things. I watched him in the deadmines and constantly hearing him yelling NO WIPE is annoying.
---
On the loot, what I saw, was that he could need the gear he wanted. Maybe I spoke to soon.
---
Again, I don't hate him, he was annoying.
---
Imagine feeling like you need to defend your favorite streamer as they get paid to play a beta and play it poorly with misinformation.
---
Cool to see my clip got so many views, thanks x)
---
Just pointing out the ridiculousness of the hardcore absolutely no changes crowd
---
just on the point of charge, can't charge in defensive and he wasn't specced into tactical mastery
---
the thing is , even if you played in vanilla, you won't remember details like regen anyway.
---
I'm very fascinated by "MMORPG pidgin."  I really notice it more in smaller games where there is just one server for everyone.
---
In any case, there are certain things I will never tire of that non-native English speakers do, like pluralize mass nouns.  Normally such errors bother me, but there's something cute about it.  It's like when a little kid says "I goed to the store."  There's a kind of nonsensical logic to it all.
---
Warriors were absolute trash without pocket healers and/or Berserker buff in BG's.
---
Because people are upset they're not getting into the beta and feel they're more entitled to it than streamers, despite the fact giving beta access to streamers first and forthmost allows more people to experience the beta (even if vicariously).
---
He clicks some abilities that he hasn't decided on binding yet.
---
Def big No
---
dudes are mad salty
---
Wasn't that done to that Jesus picture?
---
I don't know why but this really makes me crack the fuck up. Bring out your Pagmats!
---
Most likely not all of us, but I mean we had millions of players back then so it's not unlikely that a majority here did play back then (I played us/eu/kr beta even!)
---
Exactly!
---
Those pvp videos are warriors either being followed by a pocket healer and/or killing fresh 60's in world pvp with AQ/Naxx gear.
---
That‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to make.
---
No fucking way I'm rolling on latin servers even if they make them.  
---
  They've always been a cesspool.
---
You have to keep in mind these guys all have good gear and each of them are good players. The druid and mage were very good. Your average DM group isn't going to be nearly as geared or as knowledgeable about the game.
---
I played a lot on pservers and even the best ones had horrendous scripting and patrolling
---
it seems like invs are going out around 6pm EDT every night
---
At his desk. Efficiency is key during that first week.
---
Not exactly the same thing, but back in TBC, I played a destruction warlock (with an imp instead of a voidwalker), and my girlfriend played a fire mage. It was TERRIBLY inefficient, but most of the time, we could blow things up before they murdered us.
---
Again, super inefficient. (And also TBC and not vanilla.) But it was definitely crazy amounts of fun.
---
Evidence? I did play with Australian ping, but I also note that this exploit relies on high ping, not low ping, so if anything it should have been easier for me than for people who lived without an ocean between them and the server. And I found it impossible.
---
He did raid mythic for quite a while IIRC.
---
I've always played on English servers, it's good to learn and to meet people from different countries.
---
Your English doesn't have to be perfect, just understandable. When you're among many people that speak English as a second or even third language, everyone is very tolerant.
---
I wasn't basing it on private servers. I said in my post that I was playing vanilla when I was in my early teens.
---
I agree. And if you ever catch me doing that on stream, you should block me and never watch me again.
---
Thanks for the responses everyone! Appreciate the insight.
---
You can play dressup with the gear that u want to wear and look like. You dont need transmog for this. That's fantastic news for you.
---
That is server-side though, weather effects run on the client. The server probably only tells when to swap the weather.
---
Questing / Leveling Joanna. Rep, wowheads classic site? Gearing, there are many google spreadsheets out there, just google them.
---
Don't worry, there are tons of us out there who like what we see and realize it's impossible to make it exactly the same as 15 years ago. It looks great so far.
---
the hardest part for raiding will jsut be getting 40 people who can all be on at the same time, just raid with people you like and youll get through pretty much all of the raids but naxx, naxx requires a bit more effort then the rest
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Go look at all the threads now being made about how much of a joke he is.
---
Asmongold stream hit 100k and has been the highest view count streamer in the entire site for hours now.   
---
  There's a reason why blizz went from "no sharding" to "sharding when needed" to "layer entire realms".  
---
  They've noticed the interest is fucking gargantuan and it keeps rising.
---
Because people need to come up with a reason that they **deserve** to be in the beta over someone else and they're not going to just admit that they're jealous entitled brats now are they.
---
Tips just rode the Classic hype wave. He has no idea what he's talking about. If I remember correctly he went on rant about how "Vanilla hasn't been solved" Implying that there are many secrets just waiting to be discovered that would radically change the way the game is played, while in reality vanilla has been  ‚âà 98% solved and any new discovery made is at most going to change some BiS lists.
---
Fucking glorious :)
---
Even as a feral tank? :)
---
You don't respec for dungeons until 60...
---
I won‚Äôt be on a pvp server.
---
anything i think i remember could be from bc or wrath too
---
not to mention the things i would remember was mostly at 60
---
which is something we cant even test
---
not many people spent a great deal of time at 1-40
---
heck half 60 friends helped me level and boosted me some of the way which was not uncommon
---
The Alliance's primary capital was in ruins for 6 real life years.
---
Guess I‚Äôm spineless.
---
He did have to kind of guide some people through giving advice tho
---
True. I have noticed that most of the conversations in the comments are really long and thought out. A lot more mature than most subs.
---
But when it comes to the sacred "I played back in 2004 and this guy didn't so I'm better" Is getting really annoying and childish.
---
I find vanillawowdb.com more comprehensive than classicdb.ch.  It is a more wowhead-like site, but it seems slower to generate its data lists.  classicdb has a nice talent calculator.  wowhead has one too and the site itself is OK, but I don't like some things about how they've tried to do class info for Classic.
---
&gt; spend hours and days creating content and outright refuse to receive anything in return for it?
---
What is it they refuse to receive? Can you opt-out of the revenue? Content creators, for the most part, get paid and very few of them refuse the money they earn.
---
In case no one knows yet, Tipsout is a fake. He literally said that rogues use axes in vanilla... Don't support him.
---
How are they different from crits?
---
It‚Äôs still far better in most situations with easy pulls to charge-&gt;battle shout/clap-&gt;def stance for initial  aggro as opposed to body pulling or ranged pulling.
---
We all know that the big streamers main purpose is to bring attention to the game to people who aren‚Äôt as invested as everyone here, just saying.
---
So...two streamers not to watch. Got it.
---
When I was a teen playing TBC people in my guild were your age with responsibilities raiding with us. You will be fine.
---
Vanilla wow is the reason I attended university at 21 rather than 19
---
After Ion confirmed we'd release with 16 debuffs, when the ClassiCast got back to their rooms the first thing he said was "this means Shadow Priests are viable and Hunters will cast Serpent Sting"
---
He's a casual who lies about being hardcore. He's the smurf in League that says his main is Diamond.
---
It really depends on your raid group and how geared they are. Lucifron kills can go from 3 mins to under 10 seconds. Fastest Veal kills are under 20 secs, but most guilds will have a hard time breaking under 30s on that fight even after Naxx.
---
And here I was thinking, "yeah right, guy. These are just idle words!"
---
lol that clip. I'm pretty sure WotF has always dispelled the same three statuses throughout every expansion, too.
---
I bet you stand in fire.
---
i only subbed and signed up yesterday and im not NA but i do have a vanilla account and get invites to most beta stuff ill see and update
---
‚ÄúYou think you do, but you don‚Äôt.‚Äù
---
I think we did.
---
Probably. Not only is there a way bigger audience for classic right upfront, every single player that leaves retail and goes to classic is a double loss for retail accounting for a -1 instead of a 0 like we are used to. Retail will be dead in weeks..
---
The real draw back is the fact that as a hunter, you lose a whole bag slot.
---
Instead of another bag holding more loot, one bag slot is allocated to a quiver/ammo pouch which can ONLY hold its corresponding ammo.
---
I love it though, I love restocking arrows/bullets. And having to make that small decision to be a cheapskate and only by the cheapest ammo because I am just doing some questing.  Or conversely buying the best ammo I can use, because im about to run a dungeon for the first time.
---
basically a scammer
---
Ew. Melee combat text in BfA is fucking terrible. The way they float off to the side has no impact.
---
Still haven't gotten one uhhggggg
---
Been playing since Vanilla. Been subscribed without missing a month ever since. Been invited to every beta and most alphas for the expansions ever since. How am I so unlucky with the one beta I actually care about? reeee
---
There's a large (1k+ members) Oceanic Classic discord here: https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H
---
I wouldn't call monetization a problem, itself, I'd say it's more of an execution problem of the ad system with ad length, how close you can space them, etc.
---
For my vidocs on game history I won't place an ad closer than 10 minutes. So in one of my 33 minute mini documentaries I only have 2 mid-rolls.
---
Truthfully I wish we could choose the total ad time per slot so I can say like no more than 15s or 30s of ads. So 2 7-second ads or 2 15-second, 1 30-second, etc. That kind of thing. 
---
I think if channels had more control over the ad timings you'd see more advertisers begin to rope things in a bit.
---
I'm perfectly fine sitting through an ad and midrolls but I've unfollowed several channels due to abusing slots. I saw 3 mid-rolls on a 15 min vid once plus a pre-roll and I'm like SON WTF.
---
I get it wanting to make some coin but even with my rather high CPM (cash per 1k ad views) I still make more through donations, memberships and MERCH OMG but I have 1 item and it's a coffee cup because everyone has enough Ts haha!
---
But yeah - I'd like to limit the length of the ads in slots, would be a game changer for monetization, IMO. "Allow ads over 30s?" Then I'd select "fuck off" from the drop-down XD
---
They've played this game for 15 years, they're overleveled, deadmines is an introductory dungeon, they've been mostly alliance too so they know the instance like the back of their hand.  
---
  They're also coordinated.  
---
  They still needed a fair amount of cc and coordination.  
---
  You don't really feel the difficulty until zul farrak? that's when things start getting hard.
---
No you can't.  I mean you can have an opinion about it sure but it's too close to call.
---
This is great stuff. It's just the beta and yet Blizzard can clearly see we were right about player interest in Classic.
---
Vanilla is hard when you have fun.
---
Everyone plays to have fun. So you do a risky pull, or you go into dangerous territory, or you take on a mob you shouldn't. And so on.
---
If you're really good you'll be fine doing that for the most part, but most sent really good and end up dying quite a bit.
---
"Hard" is entirely subjective. If accomplishing your goals or even just what you *feel* like would happen is hard, then the game is hard.   
---
And accomplishing what you feel should happen *is* hard in vanilla.
---
yeah its still probably better, still need to range or face pull if you're trying to pull only a couple mobs obviously.
---
Funniest thing is everyone on the retail subreddit downplaying this like it means nothing for the success of classic. Even with all the data behind how much people love this game there's still so many naysayers.
---
Fair few people asking for this after posting the Rogue Sword progression guide. [Alliance Weapon progression can be found here](https://i.imgur.com/Zoc7Qc5.png).  
---
Credits again to Kargoz.
---
I would really really like it to be back.  It was sad the day I could no longer do it. :(
---
That‚Äôs why he was cc-able! You have to kite him lol
---
I was alliance then, and will be again.
---
The miss / dodge rate is off so they aren‚Äôt missing like they should and killing mobs faster
---
Spanish speaker here, I have played on english speaking realms since day one because there are no RP realms for spanish speakers. But at this point I am kinda grateful because I feel I've improved so much by just playing a game, whereas other people spend money on expensive courses to learn the language lol.
---
So yeah, I plan on playing on a gringo realm in Classic too!
---
Classic Beta had WoW as the #1 streamed game on Twitch earlier today. I think that says enough.
---
from what i know bear tanks arent really that bad, warriors are definitely the best but bears could do reasonably well, and since the /sit trick doesnt work in classic to help warriors generate more threat its kind of a buff to bear tanks. you likely wont be picked over a warrior as a main tank, but more so as an off tank or for dungeon tanking
---
Im not *basing an argument* on what "some think". Im attempting to explain a position i do not hold myself to someone who asked about it. Something i can not do without referring to the people making that argument. Im sorry if i didnt take statistics on exactly how many people have said the words "slippery slope" before i grossly overstepped and said ive heard the term thrown around
---
I do however sympathize with the people who are fearful that blizzard will let the way they've  handled monetization and design decitions in other games bleed into wow classic. If you could explain to me why thats irrational id gladly.change my opinion.
---
Looks great! But the 1080p one looks like it's just a squished version. Is that intended or just what ya had to work with?
---
Yeaaah I'm just about graduating college but I also did a year and a half of internships. But yeah I was playing classic in the 3rd and 4th grade
---
Horde for life. Not sure how people can stomach playing Alliance tbh. Oh well, more HKs for me.
---
SL Lock needs a lot of gear. You won't spec SL for the first few raid tiers of gear, and even then, you better have good gear or it doesn't work. Locks in general are very gear dependant for PvP.

---
**Kargoz refuses to update his guides to take into account p-server bugs that were well known to not exist in Classic. Take with a grain of salt!**
---
His Warrior, Paladin, Rogue, and Druid guides are considered unsuitable for leveling.
---
Supply and demand. US is a single country with rather balanced economy all around the states whereas EU it's completely different and some countries are really poor, yet their sub costs the same. That's why there are more people in EU wanting to grind gold for sub but not enough people to sell those tokens so the price increases. For the same reason the prices are even higher in Asia.
---
My theory has been that they‚Äôre doing waves multiple times a day. That lets them control the flow so that layering technology doesn‚Äôt obscure the earliest couple of days and things that might go wrong. 
---
I fully expect that we‚Äôll reach Layering population and a wave will go out to completely fill that new layer. 
---
Basically checking for a few days that everything *works*, then begin testing the layering, and then adding stress to it each new cycle.
---
Se ens like i need to sub afterall
---
This needs more people confirming/debunking it :l
---
I'm in a similar situation. I am considering starting a guild to raid once a week (might be on a weekday) in a casual way. I think now that we have the internet most raiders will have better class guides and better knowledge of the raids. That should allow a more casual approach to the raids.
---
I watched the stream on the background, he was dpsing because other bosses didn't two-shot people like that.
---
They were probably all playing private servers since then.
---
This one dude talking is trying to say taking the staff is better than the legs lol morons
---
Uuuuhhhhh there was server transfers in vanilla homie.
---
I‚Äôll continue to bitch and moan about layering being there for my entire 1-60 and even 60 experience for a while. I get the need for some kind of sharding or player management in the lower zones, where there‚Äôs a bottleneck, but the entire world seems super overkill. 
---
That being said, I‚Äôm still positive about it as a whole. People should always voice their concerns and opinions, but yeah, some people take it too far and act childish.
---
I dont see how layering solves this quoted problem.
---
It's nice for completionists yeah. And also just to check if you've vendored a useful quest reward like the skull of Impending doom.
---
If anyone's wondering why they give streamers access to beta, there you go! That's incredible exposure.
---
Got any numbers? What is it now and what was it originally in vanilla?
---
I use a high back "large" leather executive High Back office chair. Suuuuuuper comfy. I'm not a big guy, 6'3", 215lbs with a 34" waist so I don't need "large" - but I use the width because I always cross one of my legs under, or both, etc.
---
Been using mine about 4 years, no wear on the leather or stitches but the padding is starting to go in the front where I cross one foot under.
---
The trick is finding a chair that's labeled for 8+ hours of use per day which are usually "manager" style chairs since I guess managers push pencils all day :D
---
Forgot where I got mine or what brand it is, but the executive high back style is awesome.
---
The weapon progression lists are not impacted by anything to do with that though and are still a decent resource.
---
Saying people get keys implies that there are keys which could be given to other people.
---
if you really think toxicity like that will be so wide spread as to ruin the game, it says something about your mindset and this community in general, just sayin.
---
There's a reason tip pushes no loot trading, because he's exactly the kind of toxic asshole to do something like that, and he projects and thinks *everyone* else is as bad as he is.
---
I don't think he's right but in the event that he is the classic community deserves to burn. In reality loot trading is going to be fine and not going to be a problem 99.99% of the time.
---
Father of 4, reporting for duty sir. Maybe start a guild(ish) here before it comes live.
---
Well yeah I agree that it's getting a bit old, the core reason though for it is that people who played back then know that it wasa great game and are scared that people who have never played without QoL (group finder etc) will influence the devs to add these things because it's hard to understand why a lack of QoL made the game better if you never played back then.
---
The divide between old and new players should go away as soon as the game release since then everyone can take part of the epic adventure that awaits!
---
100% could do paid realm transfers. There were free migrations as well due to balance/population, but you could always pay to transfer to a different server. Only limitation I recall was if the server was less than 3 months old or so, so people didn't flood a fresh server with super geared out 60s and dominate. It used to happen where new servers would be launched and a guild would transfer to it and take all of the server firsts and secure an AQ gate event.
---
He got staff at the end
---
The answer is always troll.
---
Is night elf the best hunter?
---
because tips didn't play vanilla and acts like hes vanilla god
---
just get a herman-miller like a true gamer.
---
blizz thinks everyone wants mobile phone diablo 
---
id say its safe to say their jusgment at what people want died a long time ago
---
classic will do to retail as osrs did to rs3
---
What do you mean? That he still plays with passion or that he plays poorly? I ask this as seeing a total of maybe 30 seconds of his videos.,
---
Sorry, I know you plan to play Classic, but there are subreddits better suited for answering peripheral/furniture questions than r/classicwow.
---
Some of the ‚Äúrecommended weapons‚Äù that you get from quests are often unsoloable for the level he suggests so that part of the guide isn't as viable for a fresh server.
---
Ya, I will look at some manager style chairs. I keep seeing these "gamer" chairs that look straight outta an F1 car or some shit, not sure how I feel about those
---
I wish I had that money
---
We're also seeing streamers do it, who are better than average players who know the content well.
---
Got over 3000 subs for killing VC.
---
Yes, there was paid transfers. Blizzard devs in interviews have even confirmed as much and said they would consider it down the line with Classic but haven't worked out the details just yet. You're completely wrong and should stop making yourself look dumb.
---
they are both not really good players, ofc they die a lot.
---
Nice anecdote bro
---
I personally think about 90% of people don‚Äôt understand Asmons level of sarcasm. He says and does things wrong without explaining or correcting himself, all the time. He knows what he‚Äôs doing, he gets huge reactions from chat and keeps things active and fun.
---
If you‚Äôve ever actually listened to any of his opinion pieces he‚Äôs a smart articulate guy.
---
Still don‚Äôt get me wrong, he isn‚Äôt a great player.
---
Me. I plan to play it as a duo with my girlfriend, with just the same mindset as when I was a kid playing TBC. Which is, I'm on an adventure, not really planning ahead or knowing what item I should be targeting while levelling, I just run around, quest, make friends, do dungeons and get excited about every tiny upgrade I find, no matter how shitty it is. I'm gonna love the hell out of it.
---
I didn't play endgame content at all until WoD really, I was max level in Wotlk and Cata but stopped playing soon after. For me I was always just a nooby kid running around in shitty gear, loving every moment. That's the main reason I wanna play classic, cos WoW these days is so focused on endgame and levelling is such a faceroll and spoiled by things like heirlooms. I'm here for the journey.
---
Sounds like a blast.  Me and my buddies played about a week or two before finally starting to figure out what was going on and then decided to re-roll to more meaningful characters (him a tank and me a healer).  I will never be able to recreate that: sitting down and popping the top on a xxl Monster, popping 2 adderal and going full face first into a 48 hour grinding bender lol.  Ah the glory days haha.  Today that sounds like a heart attack and one of us having to cut a foot off due to diabetes.
---
I'll survey as much as I can!
---
Sunder armor is a big threat tool for the tank and it gets pretty bad if he can't spam it.
---
Blizz should pop up two more servers and send out more invites cause of this.
---
&gt;This sub is full of kids who hate streamers for some weird reason, some people are having meltdowns over some clips lol
---
Holy shit, so many tears, get this dude a tissue! I can just feel the sweaty damp eyed anger emanating from this comment!

I'm 51 and have no fear of doing something I'm passionate about.
---
Of course you won't have the same amount of free time you had before and you have to find the right balance on things, but that's it.
---
Classic is made to give you something out of whatever you do, you will feel you're progressing even with the smallest things, you'll just go slower.
---
if anything this beta looks much easier than pservers
---
You mean to say that Taskmaster Axe from The Deadmines isn't acquirable by soloing? Well I'll be damned...
---
VC? I don‚Äôt understand, do you skip the entirety of DM to just fight the last boss, Van Cleefe? Is this some 5head strategy I don‚Äôt know about yet?
---
Thank God. This was the big thing I was worrying about. I could care less about numbers being off but the FEEL of vanilla is just as important. Lighting, weather, ambient effects. 
---
Thank god!
---
2006 here - tried to see if you could play it on PSP so that I could carry on levelling with my friends while on honeymoon..... came back and they were 14 levels higher than me, bastards.
---
There's a shit-ton of damage control happening right now over there.
---
The hot takes. Yikes!
---
he has no common sense about this and thinks too highly of his opinion at the moment when that shouldn't be the case
---
The staff is way better. Can last you until Whirlwind Axe.
---
Druid. Mainly for tanking 5 mans, maybe some pug raids as OT. Lots of versatility. Can open world well. Pvp well. Heal if necessary, etc. jack of all trades, master on none type stuff. Always love a drood.
---
Everyone and their mother will try classic, the big question mark will be retention.
---
If you're referring to Asmon's stream, they were all 19+, with good enough gear. Its very easy at that point even in actual vanilla. Especially with War Pala Mage Rogue Druid comp
---
Hot take: They can change anything as long as it follows the "Classic" game design philosophy.
---
Meanwhile people are triggered at r/wow raging on 0 points threads lol
---
&gt;Sure clsssic might have been difficult 15 years ago but now it‚Äôs relatively easy - it‚Äôs just a major time investment.
---
Dude.
---
Humans have not evolved.
---
Gamers today are not better than wow gamers back then. Equal amount of time was spent and the tools are still keyboard+mouse. Get real.
---
What metric is that for? Watch time, stream time, peak number of streams, peak number of viewers?
---
&gt;You people are basically handling what you deem toxic behavior by being toxic in return
---
It *is* toxic behavior. And calling him out in turn is not toxic.
---
Just like a lot of us have said all along, Classic WoW will be bigger than modern WoW.
---
Except it was though, you could get into weird bugged out states where you're one place on your client but the server sees you as closer (until you move).
---
There was some weird stuff that went on in vanilla over the patches
---
Give people Classic Servers
---
Give em  A TEAM TO LISTEN TO THE CLASSIC COMMUNITY needs
---
Give people a nice beta to help em make a perfect server for the community
---
and still people shit on them every day
---
Never change Classic Reddit
---
What does this have to do with anything? Did you think I was trying to give a statistical analysis with my post? It‚Äôs clearly just an observation my from experience, maybe you played on a private server where 80% of the mobs didn‚Äôt just stand in one place in their spawn. I‚Äôd be interested to know which one that was.
---
I don‚Äôt dislike (most) streamers. But holy shit, the chat is just a constant drip of spew. It‚Äôs normally worse the bigger a streamer is, since people can just post swastikas and it‚Äôll be off screen in 2 seconds from other chat. Meanwhile on smaller streams, the chat feels so much more human.
---
You don't even have BTTV ? DansGame
---
Just Beta. I'm more convinced than ever this is going to be massive.
---
playing the game normally on a beta is a very valid way of testing
---
perp and the boys are going with a different way, which is great for depth
---
I wish we had more confirmation on this :( 
---
I've heard a few people have gotten it here and there, but it sounds like some of them had late emails and didn't check their launchers. I sure hope they're going out though.
---
Well I'll be damned, Kargoz thinks IceBarbed Spear is going to be obtainable at launch?!
---
Damn, dude, I guess I was wrong about his guides.
---
None of that shit matters in reality. They are owned by Activision and no matter what they say there is no way Activision is going to let a product launch in 2019 with 2003 graphics no matter what anyone says. Its just reality.
---
Not worth it
---
The game with the highest number of viewers at a given time is #1.
---
They weren't always free in Vanilla. There was specifically targeted "migrations" where the transfers were free as to convince people to reduce the population on an overpopulated realm, or one with a severe faction imbalance. However, willy-nilly transfers from one realm to any other still cost $25. There was also a restriction that characters on PvE servers could not transfer to PvP realms (due to the idea that it was thought to be 'bypassing' the difficulty of leveling on a PvP server, but characters on PvP servers could transfer to PvE realms.
---
Nah its just people call the dungeon VC because DM is Dire Maul.
---
So do you get an email, or does it just pop up in the region/account drop-down on the launcher?
---
"*The game wont be same, its just nostalgia*"
---
Oh no no no no HAHAHHHAAHAH look at the top of that zoomy's head hahaaha
---
..so the weapon guide is actually great you just think some of them won‚Äôt be soloable at the exact level because of (1) sit changes and (2) front stabs
---
This is an awesome guide and Kargoz is a homie for doing this
---
Most number of viewers at a particular time.
---
Sounds like retail is the game for you.
---
We had a dps, healer &amp; tank trio: 
---
Judicial - healer paladin
---
Executive - warrior tank
---
Legislative - rogue
---
staff is better. You can consider not taking it if you get the smite's hammer or taskmaster axe but if you don't, take the staff.
---
The hugest F of this beta...
---
Tips is a dumbass but you're taking the mandela effect way too seriously lol, its just a figure of speech for something you thought was 100% correct from your memories but ended up being wrong
---
Ah so if a bunch of people click on a stream and then close it after 2 minutes that would be enough to make a game #1 for those 2 minutes?
---
As someone who is playing on a private server to get ready for the classic wow launch. The fact that this guy got a beta invite and really thinks this is fucking hilariously stupid.
---
A second Fury Warrior is much better than a Druid for off-tanking. That Druid needs to be healing if you want an ‚Äúideal‚Äù party.
---
Thousands of subs after this DM run, actually insane. Classic is coming boys prepare your anusses and bask in Classic's glory.
---
God damn, that's over 10k
---
I see. Thanks
---
I didn't even get a email, that said I never do for alphas (and this classic beta.)
---
In theory, yes.
---
Well I played back in 06, and in college. However, I was like 8 at the time.
---
There‚Äôs some differences. It used the modern engine so it‚Äôll have the graphical upgrades like textures. 
---
Asmongold has a video up now playing the beta
---
&gt; It forces decision making
---
Holy shit, honestly, comments like these is the reason People view classic fans as fanatic zealots. At some point you've got to step back and take a second look at what exactly you are fighting over.
---
&gt; part of the RPG expirience
---
Giving something to the quest giver and having no empty space to recieve something back... part of the holy RPG expirience...
---
Two reasons.
---
1. Only the engineer goblins summon stuff. This is correct, it's a bug in the most popular pservers.
---
2. Tank is lvl 19. If he was level 18, he would be taking crushing blows from VC nonstop. Level is a HUGE deal in vanilla wow.
---
I used to go deadmines at 16-17 in retail vanilla and it was doable. This whole "only level 18+" thing didn't really bother people as much back then.
---
Chain pulling was a problem, but it didn't really happen if you did it right. These guys did the boat and the goblin zones very carefully.
---
I was talking about his guides in general, but some of his weapon choices are also suspect.
---
For example, he recommends Ice-Barbed Spear despite knowing that it won't be available until AV drops months later.
---
As long as the entire group is +18 level and they are careful with pulls, DM would never be a problem.
---
underestimating vanilla, like so many people do.
---
There's a lot of things. Vanilla was designed to be a slow leveling process to make it take longer. They didn't really have much to do at endgame, so it was good that it took awhile to get to the end to give them a chance to catch up. 
---
Mobs give less XP, there's less XP from quests which is easy to do. 
---
But Blizzard went a little bit further. 
---
You'll notice that a lot of quests are kind of all over the place, especially in the starter zones. That is done on purpose. Their goal is to spread them out so you have to travel more to get those quests done. 
---
Mounts are only unlocked at level 40, which again, increases the time it takes for you to get from point A to point B. This increases leveling time. They're also pretty dang expensive too, which is another barrier. 
---
Gear is another way to keep your character "in check". Most of the starting zones only award gray gear. You don't usually start getting greens (or even gear that you can use!) until around level 13. Some classes, like warriors, are very gear dependent. So not having good enough gear for their level slows down the progress they can make: more downtime and lower dps, at least at first. 
---
So when you combine all of that together, it makes the leveling experience much slower. 
---
The pros to this kind of thing is that it forces players to stick to a zone. One of the big issues with Live WoW was that you leveled so quickly, you never had to stay in a zone. Indeed, you could actually dungeon surf all the way up to level 50 or 60 without having to step out of Stormwind. 
---
Making your character scale with whatever content you were doing, was actually a ***HUGE*** upgrade to Live WoW. It allowed for players to actually complete a zone and group with others, even if they were a higher level than they are (if suited for the zone itself). 
---
Sticking to a zone helps to build the immersion that many people are asking for. But again, the drawback is that it's going to take you a much longer time to level. It will be interesting to see how people take it. 
---
I say this because pretty much the entire WoW player base was upset when Blizzard made it take longer for players to level (1-90) in Legion. 
---
Decreasing the amount of XP awarded during leveling, coupled with scaling mobs, forces players to "stay" in the zones they are in, thus populating those zones which is exactly what players were asking for in the first place. That's the only way to really do it...
---
This is why Blizzard expects a lot of players to play WoW classic, at first. It is why they plan to use the layering system. They expect a huge influx of players that will eventually die off at a quick pace, both players that never played Vanilla and those that really want it.
---
100%, whatever, I‚Äôll just stay on my private server.
---
They will keep being in denial until their servers have to close
---
&gt;  soon as he said that the quest tracker was bugged because arrows weren't showing up I closed the video
---
HAHAHAHA
---
.... were you a gnome warlock with green hair named Alia?
---
They know what people want. They also know what is most profitable.
---
They're opting for the latter.
---
Roll druid
---
Before the announcement, it was ‚ÄúTHIS SUB SUCKS, ITS JUST SHITTY MEMES!!‚Äù And now that a version of the game is out we‚Äôre hearing ‚ÄúTHIS SUB SUCKS! ITS JUST GAMEPLAY!‚Äù 
---
Not saying person 1 is in the right here, but neither is person 2.
---
I just don't see why your original point of a quest being unsoloable makes it unviable for a fresh server? If you're pushing for one of the server first 60s then yes, you probably can't get that weapon on your own. But despite that, you can always call in the help of some friends/guildees to get the weapons earlier. I know little to few players that get the whirlwind axe/weapon on their own because it's such a huge DPS increase at 30 and is stupid to leave grabbing it to much later than that.
---
This makes me so happy. Hope its intended and not something that gets nerfed/fixed. Means i get to do more dungeons and a lot of the quests i dont usually do in my private server leveling route... and more grinding, gotta love me some grinding
---
you're super wrong, but that's okay
---
Tips pulled the boss with broken gear
---
It will have the original models and both original and higher res graphics, there's an option on the interface to choose which one you want.
---
Private servers had stacking armor debuffs, which is the distinction. They didn't know how it actually worked on retail vanilla so they got it wrong. On top of that, they also got the armor values themselves wrong in many cases. So there's definitely going to be a huge discrepancy relating to the "tankiness" of mobs/bosses in Classic as it compares to private servers.
---
I guess if you're avoiding the outside bring the outside to you?
---
Mages don‚Äôt have to pee because it all gets channeled as fireballs.  Mages would do well in r/hydrohomies.
---
My Holy priest is going to level as shadow
---
So your solution to layering is to add more servers because... having a layer that is the same thing as another server that gets merged is bad?
---
That's ace, dude.
---
Merging realms as initial spikes die down is effectively what layering does
---
No he is correct in his statement, without /sit acting the way it does on pservers your probability of being crit goes from 100% to about 5%, this mean you will have an almost 25 damage drop from not getting consistent enrage procs. That is not an opinion, that is a fact. But saying either tree is objectively better, that would be wrong
---
Fucking agree :3
---
Hunter was my very first toon ever and I made it to lvl 44 before ever using a trap lol.
---
Who needs Deadmines Axe when you can get $7000 from Twitch Prime
---
I was watching their stream last night. They were wiping constantly in WC, even to trash mobs. I quit watching the stream because of all the painful corpse runs.
---
In this clip, the tank died with a busted chest armor and belt. The armor were completely broken because he died so many times.
---
&gt; I just don't see why your original point of a quest being unsoloable makes it unviable for a fresh server? If you're pushing for one of the server first 60s then yes, you probably can't get that weapon on your own. But despite that, you can always call in the help of some friends/guildees to get the weapons earlier.
---
There's going to be a lot of disappointed Warriors and Paladins (Verigan's Fist) if they think like you do and follow p-server guides.
---
&gt;Denying that there is a chance blizzard will treat wow classic the same as all its other franchises is ludicrous in my eyes.
---
I agree but that doesn't support the slippery slope argument. You **have** to show how action **A** leads to action **Z**, you haven't done that. You've just stated the blizzard is a money hungry company that will do anything to earn more money. If blizzard decides to introduce microtransaction it **won't** be because they tested the waters with being able to order your characters in the characters selection screen.
---
Correct, can't waste valuable leveling time on going outside you know! Yet I still want to feel some summer grass below my feet, so I had to improvise
---
Is that quest started in Darnassus?
---
Exactly.  Layering is just virtual servers that merge together of their own accord later.
---
died from those fuckers many times...
---
I absolutely hate how the items/mobs are named in my language. Even trade chat is kinda strange to look at.
---
Still, I'll be playing spanish servers if they exist, because my friends will be there.
---
Including the [idiot twitter blue checkmark shitter from IGN](https://twitter.com/ErrorJustin/status/1128355574838644737) who said that Classic WoW _"will be the biggest, most high-profile example of gamers not actually wanting the thing they think they want."_
---
They're playing very carefuly and have an insane comp. Paladin off healing + mage sheep   is huge. There is no way they can die with that comp unless they fuck up hard
---
This is so crazy! Amazing how interested people are for Classic!
---
Why would you take people that are not subbed? If you take people who are not subbed you would invite way more people who may not even touch the beta, or be interested in it. Why think of it as a cash grab? It‚Äôs not like they advertised this, they are just choosing the best applicants. Put the pitchfork away lol.
---
Check this guy's history, what a mess. You're not even worth to be taken in consideration. Good luck with your anger management, dude.
---
I wouldn't mind testing a leveling strategy.  I haven't played since official servers and I'd like to see if my build I had back in the day is even good.  But yeah I don't know about spending hours investing into a character.  I would like to be able to bounce around and learn and unlearn talents.  But I would suspect we can't do that without the usual reset for gold.
---
If you love classic and want it to succeed then I don't see anything wrong with supporting it the only way it matters... with our wallets.
---
It's so funny how these people have been asking for classic for years now and when the company finally decides to take the risk and deliver the product, they are reluctant to pay for it. 
---
And okay I understand it's just not enough for you and you consider it not worth your money, fair enough... But I don't understand the audacity to get mad at a company for making profit out of people who ARE willing to pay.
---
 "To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we‚Äôll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account"
---
layering is to ensure that every server has a healthy population after the hype starts to die down without the need of merging individual servers. were also not sure how the layer transferring is going to work. it might have a cooldown, it might also not have seperate resources, and we dont know how it works with combat. will it pull you out of active combat? does it have a timer that you have to wait for after leaving combat? we have to wait and see for people to test it on the beta. you also say that phase 1 will be full of teleportation bullshit, but ion mentioned it will only be for the first few weeks, and is guaranteed to be gone by phase two, so its likely to only last for 1-2 months at the most.
---
Yeah more and more it seems like more of a hassle than it's worth, although enh has been my favorite class for years now. I think I may just go with Warrior or Warlock
---
I played back then at 5 years old. Only because my uncles raided in vanilla and they tought me to play so I could farm easy shit for them. I remember hours of farming kolkars for linen in the barrens.
---
gotta say, this is a first lol
---
I'm sorry, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything. I believe Asmon hit the same viewercounts on Uldir's release. Does that mean BfA is good?
---
People are currently on the hype train, just checking things out. And of course there's going to be hype; Classic is all that's been talked about by influencers for months now. But it doesn't mean a thing for its success. We'll have to wait until release to prove /r/wow wrong.
---
Might have been Mynis. SB Ally had as many strong warriors as we did tbh.
---
It was a group of skilled people who knew their classes, the pulls/bosses, and were all on voice chat. It was definitely a smooth run but it didn't seem undertuned imo. It's going to be a *lot* rougher for pug groups who have never played their class in an instance before.
---
Be honest. This will serve as your litter box during the leveling grind.
---
I'm just thankful WoW came out right after I had finished College or else I would have failed miserably. Now I get to play all over again with my kids...how times have changed.
---
You're making far more of a big deal of this than it needs to be. You asked for vanilla, and blizzard wants to help streamline the first couple months. I can gaurentee that you would rather be able to get your 5 cactus apples and your boars killed instead of them all being downed forever and you unable to progress in an even remotely efficient manner. Fr quit your bitching it's not a big deal. Down the line nobody will even talk about the layering blizz introduced at the start of classic. Quit finding shit to bitch about for the sake of bitching and at least appreciate the fact blizz is giving you what you want. If you don't want layering go play some pserver. If you want a blizz supported game, then deal with what it is and at least try to have fun. It's literally not even a big deal at all.
---
that doesn't change the fact that the damage is right and completely vanilla like
---
Bruh don‚Äôt ruin the flavor of my warrior lol
---
So there‚Äôs been 2 options floated so far. Sharding starting zones, and Layering. Personally, I‚Äôd rather have neither, but I understand for the health of the game, some assistance is necessary. 
---
So with option 1, Sharding, we get starting zones sharded. Maybe even the 10-20s, which would be less than ideal, but whatever, it‚Äôs just the first day /played of gameplay. 
---
But then with layering, the entire 1-60 process and world is potentially layered. I realize that they haven‚Äôt gone into any detail about it‚Äôs properties and extent of use, but if it‚Äôs the entire continent, 1-60 as they say, it‚Äôs overkill. Either they didn‚Äôt make enough servers and we will be stuck with a higher than vanilla pop after they remove layering, or they have to make it last the entire phase one, which could be 3-4 months. 
---
I get the need for starting zone assistance, it‚Äôs the *first impression* and being in a bottleneck isn‚Äôt fun. But at some point, I think the cons outweigh the pros. Right around the level where world PvP starts to pick up, 30+, there shouldn‚Äôt really be any need for layering. Yes, you will struggle more to find mobs, but that just encourages cooperating, or using other ways to level to supplement your gameplay, like dungeons.
---
You fundamentally dont understand what layering is.
---
You do realize the games been out for 15 years right? People are much better at wow now so obviously they‚Äôll be good at classic too.
---
right warriors need healers lol  that's totally true on pservers as well. I'm a pocket healer, when my warrior roams off he gets in trouble
---
tell your friends and loved ones that youre going on a cruise and never talk to them again so they think you got in a shipwreck, that way you wont be interrupted while playing vanilla
---
That‚Äôs true. The warrior guest, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a wonderful person, but he was really bad at answering questions and elaborating
---
‚ÄòSo call me a ‚Äònerd‚Äô all you like. I don‚Äôt give a damn haha‚Äô
---
I mean you came here and made a gigantic post about it so that doesn‚Äôt seem true.
---
A true botanist. Using his own manure.
---
the one I play on does just fine tho so
---
If you're unaware, summer as a season goes from June 21 to September 23. August is within the bounds of summer, unlike your suggested dates (which would each be *after* the end of their respective seasons).
---
I wish we didn‚Äôt need an active sub to get invited to the beta, but I would happily pay the sub after I got an invite. I have a spare token on one of my characters that I planned on using when classic releases, now I‚Äôm considering using it early for a chance to get on and try it out.
---
But the staff is way better... What you on about?
---
i'll call wrong info on that (and happily be wrong).
---
Afaik, weather effects got tuned down in cata (in the old world) due to sharding. People zoning in and out of zones with different weather effects was too much of an immersion break and not feasable with sharding technology.
---
As opposed to retail's second row position with ever-decreasing subs?
---
I hear Don Lemon is on.
---
yeah people will wipe in WC I get that and won't argue that fact. I've wiped in WC
---
For me it popped up in my license list, I just refreshed it every once in a while.
---
Joana used about 12 hours to hit 20 in his 1-60 record, so the values seems to be about right
---
Yea, they try to defend current WoW stating that it is just as hard end game or harder than it ever was in vanilla and vanilla was just a time sink and required no skill. Even when you have sound arguments as to why that's not really true you just get downvoted to hell.
---
The rogue one too.
---
Tips "why would you go this route?"
---
Rogue "cuz its better "
---
More people have been receiving keys every few hours from what I can gather. Esfand stayed it on his stream that people he knew were getting invited throughout today. There was also a post somewhere on this sub with someone from blizz saying there would be more weeks with invites.
---
 I‚Äôm guessing it will be an intermittent trickle.
---
Has he been reporting bugs? I really really hope so.
---
Thanks. Yeah unfortunately, that's what I had to work with.  
---
I'm using the 1080p myself, as the other scales outside of my monitor.  
---
However, depending on your monitor try the 3440p.
---
Deadmines was Alliance only right?
---
Huh, I didn't think about that. That does have some merit I think, it shows commitment to a main over a long term. Not like it matters to anyone but the account owner though.
---
No it isn't. Stop saying this stupid shit. You can compare the regen rates to Joanna's videos and they are identical.
---
Raided with him on a pserver, at least he out dpsed the tanks lol
---
The server size without layering will be more than twice the size of vanilla servers iirc.  
---
Even in higher level zones, it would be an issue.
---
It‚Äôll be less of an issue for those who rush through as fast as they can, since they‚Äôll likely be in the minority of players, but for those who won‚Äôt be rushing through, life without layering would be hell all the way up to 60. 
---
And forcing people to have to group up or spam dungeons or what not, isn‚Äôt really a great alternative either.
---
Well he can't play on the legit server since it's closed beta
---
Not sure, pathing is my biggest remaining concern with Classic. DM:W and Scholo soloing are entirely dependent on mob pathing, and we won‚Äôt know until launch or a level 60 beta test if they still function.
---
You laugh at people, but I was 7-8 when I started playing WoW. Everyday after my 0th grade (a primary school-like year in pre-school) lessons I'd run to my cousin's to play my troll hunter and undead mage.
---
Shit I was hoping not to do that and wanting a notification
---
This would not surprise me at all, I just hope blizz don't fuck it up in the end. I really want this to be an amazing experience.
---
There‚Äôs a reason Orc is BiS
---
Seriously man, I remember having to write a god damn book before every pull back in the day. Make sure everyone knows who to pull, who to sap, who to MC...and these were just regular fucking dungeon mobs. Half the fun was being challenged.
---
Proc effects and how things proc would be included in server-side code, which can vary wildly between private servers. The physical world, how your character looks and moves, weather and spell effects, sounds, etc, etc, are all handled by the client, and it is the same as it was in 2006.
---
NE for Ally. That agil is hella good for crits. Unless you want stoneform then dwarf. But you lose out on that agility for dps.
---
Yeah, because being able to switch speccs is the only difference between Vanilla and BfA.
---
Starting PhD #2.  Would be lying if I said time to play classic didn‚Äôt somewhat factor into the decision.
---
i don't. have a link?
---
Yes, exactly. Because you cannot hop between realms on demand like you can with layers. :) Thanks for your reply
---
Isnt it 7500?  They get 2.49per correct?
---
Night elf, shadowmeld + aimed shot = surprise motherf...!
---
To be fair, this sub would do the same with the 300k+ viewers for uldir race.
---
They are really salty classic is getting all this traction.
---
He did play on a private server though.
---
Dont forget the *3000subs* he got towards the end and after the run
---
Asmongold isn't very good at WoW so this makes sense.
---
the question is if a server can handle lets say 3k people without layers
---
but they let there be multiple 3k layers in the hope population drops after the first month
---
what exactly happens when they disable layers and there is suddenly 9k or more people on one layer
---
or will they use this as an excuse like they obviously cant disable layers on the popular servers because people wont like the experience
---
Lol, Sarah's Guide is Horde-only.
---
Yes, true. My main concern is the resources part, though. Being able to hop on a different Azeroth with your same character whenever you please.
---
Thank you. I was looking for this answer for quite some time and never found an official source.
---
Some additions to the game has been good, some have been bad. "Electricity should never have been invented because"...
---
Being suspended in the air is time where you can't really move, so it could make the warrior's life harder at unexpected times. Best to just fix it.
---
would be really nice if you added attack speed.
---
Many big streamers get a higher % than 50 so it was probably more.
---
What's your problem. Fuck you too dude. I was just expressing an opinion. It's 2019. Chill.
---
I just dislike this guy trying to lerch subs while being wrong or stealing info and rebrandibg it as his research. Aldo reminds me of shady car seller.
---
You can do that from invisible right but apparently it gets nerfed down the line so that wont work? Would the race change when that happens.
---
Hell yeah
---
Heuhuehue DAE call it DM?!! 
---
On NA servers deadmines was very commonly called VC, after the quest you get to kill him.
---
I'm pretty sure they get 3$ per sub, 2$ goes to twitch. Atleast that was according to Sodapoppin

This isn't a "i didn't get into beta" thing, this is a "this game should've been out for summer" thing.  "Summer is until Sept 22 tho" apologists take a hike.  The end of August is the end of summer for many of us, those in school/college, and those of us with kids going back to school.  Best part is they know people don't have things to play in summer since there's no major releases then, thus their predatory tactic of making people pay for a chance to even get into beta.. defend that.
---
So far there has been very few bugs reported.  The systems are fine.  If they were truly concerned about bug fixes, there would be a LOT more people in beta.  They're following a financial timeline for investors/marketing, or not wanting it to overshadow their terrible retail live product.  Oh, and they wouldn't be trying to GOUGE the players they know excited for Classic, that they LOST due to retail sucking, by making them resub for a chance to get in.
---
Sorry if it hurts, but the truth does that.
---
I never played private servers. I played a lot of rogue back then but maybe I‚Äôm just misremembering
---
Is this backstabbing consistently while strafe spamming ?
---
Ohh got it got it.
---
So if you ask to do DM you want to do all wings like DM:E, DM:N, DM:W?
---
&gt; This clip also gives me the smug satisfaction after everyone said over and over on this sub that dungeons are trivial, and you don't need to be tank specced to tank or heal specced to heal and you don't need to be at or higher level than the dungeon to do them.
---
I healed every dungeon up to ST on my shadow spec priest, usually a level or two lower than the boss of the dungeon. I'm pretty sure I never had a prot spec tank in all that time either.
---
It wasn't about spec so much.
---
But Uldaman, Sunken Temple and beyond would wreck the hell out of a group that wasn't playing well or was underlevelled. They certainly were not trivial.
---
That's something pf a misnomer. They are technically viable off tanks for some fights. Less than 1% of actual raid guilds ever bring them with the express purpose of off tank.
---
Warrior is definitely more fun if you‚Äôre looking at PvE tanking strictly.  Warrior just has far more tools to use on a frequent basis.
---
Druid is pretty much Maul / Swipe with little more to do.  Every once in a great while you can pull off a clutch brezz or something, but it‚Äôs a fairly rare occurrence. 
---
Now if you consider that druids can run a HotW spec and both tank and heal with one spec, the conversation changes a bit.
---
How many viewers does he normally have at this hour?
---
Yes, they do. They typically use the 1.12.1 release (5875) client that was pushed on Sep. 19, 2006. A lot of people are confused about this.
---
20.5 dps weapon or a tiny bit of str to boost your shitty weapon's AP by a miniscule amount
---
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
Now you're going to see this sub start to transition from mad/angry people, back into Stockholm Sydrome cadets because they fall for breadcrumbs, every, time.
---
Bruv, I think you take this a bit too seriously. You make it seem like he killed someone. He's a stream/YouTube personality. What he does in the world, both wow and irl, doesn't matter. Stop wasting your time by hating in him because he's just getting more views and more popular by this kind of response. In entertqinment, no publicity is bad publicity.
---
Themechanic is 26 now :)
---
Dwarf for stoneform for PVP.
---
NE racials are pretty trash.
---
$2.49 in cash and some indeterminate amount in stream health over the long term.  I think the percentage cut you get varies with your affiliation level with twitch too.
---
Yeah that response is absolutely insane
---
I actually remember a lot of details from my young days of wow-ing, even though I had to be between 7 and 9 when I started playing (I was 9 when TBC launched and I only ever remember seeing classic launch screen.) I remember stuff like my char name, pet name, questing route, proffessions etc. even though I took break from TBC to basically WoD(played some Wotlk), since my cousin moved out and we didn't have good enoough internet for WoW until I was 12.
---
Thats crazy man
---
Tribe and Perplexity seemed like cool people on the pvp summit hosted by Tips (lmao WC). They are really knowledgeable about the game, good on them for testing the game when it‚Äôs supposed to be, during the beta
---
except he'd have a completely different class that he might not enjoy, unfortunately even within vanilla enthusiasts playing a beaten game there's too much of a raid imbalance to convince guilds that progress to bring weaker specs
---
Hey it‚Äôs cool that it got there, but you have to be realistic when looking at stats like that.
---
40 paladins
---
You reaaaaally don't think that could possibly just maaaaybe be a joke?
---
If you have a source from Blizzard saying you can freely change layers whenever you like, lets see it. 
---
Also, EQ2 had "layers" forever, and it wasn't a big deal at all.  It was automatically created and destroyed when the population got too big for a single layer.
---
Blizz thinks the Chinese market wants Diablo mobile and knows they can take in the cash by making it. Just because the American market hates it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad idea for the company.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt change anything... I‚Äôd still have to farm for gold to respec between feral or resto
---
thats why the subs are shared 
---
classic subs can pay for retail development etc
---
im sure they will try as hard as possible to fuck it up we still have not heard about wow tokens or cash shop or had them confirm they wont be in
---
Merge realms then, not layers - same thing. That whole cooldown thing is crap, you can't expect to have shared resources with invisible ghost people taking your nodes either. Combat is just a minor aspect of it - PvPing is a small part of it also, the resources are the important part imo. As for its duration, they said ideally it would be gone within a couple of weeks, but it may last 4-5, regardless, there's no use for it, even a week of that farming is too much. Thanks for your thoughtful reply, though. I just think if it's solved by realms it will eliminate this issue without downsides. :)
---
Boss tactics, yes they were harder. But most of the game in vanilla was harder. Tighter times, mobs were more varied, higher health pools, some things were trash such as white auto attacks on many melee classes. But definitely end-game raids and dungeons were harder in terms on abilities. But vanilla was also hard due to the limitations of class. Heavy mana usage, needing resistance gear, longer cooldowns, many specs being unbalanced.
---
You can't do this whenever you please. You end up on the same layer. It's out of your control.
---
Anyone looking to ‚Äúfarm‚Äù by exploiting layering placement is going to be in for a bad time, lol.
---
Don't you hate it when you think up some awesome new code but somebody stole your hole puncher?
---
&gt; Tweaked != Same. 
---
Look, I said that this argument is pedantic. I know they aren't exactly the same. Du'h. But layering is derivitive of sharding and has many of the same pitfalls.
---
&gt; It's much closer to pre-merged servers than it is sharding.
---
I am glad you brought that up! If it is like pre-merged servers (I agree, but then sharding and layering is like dividing 1 server into several).... then just have seperate servers and merge them later only if you need to.
---
He reported that no water (oddly enough, true) was below the boat in the last part of Deadmines - the boat was floating in the air. Chat insisted on calling the instance Spacemines!
---
They were also super high level compared to what I always ran as. Asmon was the lowest in the group at 19, then they had what a 20,21,22 level group mates? 
---
Shit I always did it ASAP after getting to the quests, and that was after going in to Westfall at the lowest level possible, so it was mostly 16‚Äôs, 17‚Äôs, and 18‚Äôs when I went (and group mates seemed similar) and do my best to find a tank that‚Äôs higher level.
---
I'm in my mid 30s with more time now. It's funny how things change. When WoW first came out I was so busy with School and a social life. Aside from my job and my social life I'm free to play as long as I want. I'm excited.
---
LULW
---
They definitely can successfully sheep mobs attacking other players.  There may or may not be cases where something like thorns is reflecting damage and breaking the sheep, and that seems like a bug.
---
You're right, but this is fucking Deadmines and that's Uldir. We need to wait to see how more exciting content plays out/attracts viewers, but this is definitely a promising start.
---
Just watched Asmongold's stream for a few min. And i was wondering if the hp regen out of combat isn't a bit too high ? Not a pro of vanilla/private server. But i'm pretty sure that it's not that high in the private servers. Might be wrong tho, anyone knows ?
---
Maybe. This is hardly something that says that. Blizz‚Äôs brand new thing in beta that a lot of people are at least somewhat interested in seeing is going to bring in viewers the 2nd day
---
Well it will show up in your license list, guess it depends what you find easier, constantly clicking the dropdown box (and out of experience you need to swap game tab before the dropdown box license list updates) or just hitting F5.
---
Can confirm. Was 1 year out of high school when WoW came out, just got my bachelor's degree at the beginning of this year.
---
Not a lot of people know this, but you could actually buy a regular wand and manually move it around in circles yourself.
---
tbh i think they need more subs to fund retail developmemt so thats what classic is for
---
I'm not saying there isn't interest but WoW was #1 for awhile when BfA first released as well.
---
Didn't have any (visible) stats for regen. Understanding of regen mechanics back in vanilla was an arcane art and we really need blizzard to reconstruct it from the reference client. Video footage and memory are fairly unreliable for numbers that need to be on microsoft excel. It's probably already done though, I'd imagine it's more or less what it used to be in vanilla. Nevertheless the community should still be able to make sure it's at least not completely out of bounds of what it should be.  
---
Unless I'm gravely mistaken, mp5 and hp5 would tick every 2.5 two-second ticks (e.g. it'd increment after 2 ticks, then 3, then 2, etc) and would also work during combat. Spirit would consistently increment every tick, but wouldn't work in combat.
---
How are not any of them level 30 yet?
---
Deadmines is very easy.
---
All pulls are very straight forward. You don't even need a main tank. I did most of it with a pet as main tank.
---
One of the main reason we were mad at the 1-90 leveling speed in Legion is that leveling was not rewarding anymore. So much abilities got pruned and the fact that talent trees were reduced to 6 points total made it so that you could gain 10-15 levels without even having something new, thus rendering the whole experience very boring. Longer leveling with a talent each level and new abilities every 2 levels, bundled with the fact that you don't have heirlooms rendering all gear upgrades meaningless is definitely going to feel LEAGUES more rewarding than retail.
---
A sign to take a year off living in my parents basement to raid Molten Core!
---
Lmfao
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here regarding WoW and its subscriber count.
---
I went to a site that compiles Twitch metrics and saw that the peak viewers in the past 3 days shows 530,810 viewes for League and 207,693 viewers for WoW, with Twitch having over 4 times the amount of "Watch Time" (despite only a 2x peak) and so I wondered how WoW could be considered #1 on Twitch.
---
But it makes sense to me now since it has been explained that it only has to have the most viewers for a single minute to be able to say that "It was #1"
---
Right with you dude.
---
Bwinnnnng
---
Idk if its a joke, but even BFA had huge numbers on release.  
---
If 6 months into classic it will still hold "first row", sure.  
---
But from viewer perspective Classic doesnt have much to offer beside bigger events.  
---
In general thats the case with MMOs overall and you wont skip, i think its very delusional to think otherwise. The only reason WoW as a game was able to hold 20k viewers is because eport aspects of it: people doing arenas, m+, pushing newest raid.
---
Same. I really hope they decide to add the new models in.
---
I'm lazy and didn't want to do any of that, just wait for a ding from my phone.
---
Yes, and dual spec was one of the bad ones
---
What about bugs that were known at the time but weren't actually fixed until 2.0?
---
This isn't classic
---
Man, computers just used to explode all the time, and god help you if you happen to have a cat in your lap.
---
I do not miss the age of exploding PCs.
---
Thanks for your reply. I'm not sure you get my point. I think you're under the impression that I'm worried about starting zones and cactus apples, we've moved on since sharding. Good lecture otherwise, though.
---
I believe the point he was making is that Classic WoW was likely not a good time/money investment for them compared to what else they could be doing. 
---
Similar to why they stopped making raids like Naxx. Only something like 3% of the player base actually got into Naxx. Not that it was too hard, but the progression required to get from 60 to being able to do Naxx was incredibly prohibited. Also requiring four tanks to do it was absurd which resulted in tank poaching that destroyed guilds. 
---
At that time investing resources into a game that the majority (50%+) of their player base would probably never play, is not good business sense. 
---
Downboat me all you guys want, but that's the truth of it.
---
Lol man all I‚Äôm saying is if people wanna raise concerns with regen speed that‚Äôs fine. We all want the game to be authentic. Just don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs a fact without evidence beyond ‚Äúwell I remember it being faster.‚Äù
---
I hear it's because the old models got wonky with the new animations, so they disabled them as a quality control measure.
---
In which case, it should be fine to give them as an option here, using the old animations. When they were introduced in 6.0, they were on the old animations, after all.
---
I wish I could.  I‚Äôm a one dump a day kinda guy though.
---
They said that you if you took an Invite, you‚Äôd be phased over. Also that most guilds will have a designated layer that they‚Äôll all be together in. So this really helps hardcore guilds abuse the system, by having a guild for each layer. Then just have your guilds alchemists hop into each group and get their black lotuses.
---
One thing to note, especially for Warriors, is to consider buying an [Executioner's Cleaver](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13018) around 43. It's the best transition from Whirlwind Axe and will last you until 60 when you can pick up Dreadforge Retaliator, The Nicker, or Arcanite Reaper (Ice Barbed Spear won't be available until Phase 3).
---
It'll probably cost you around 50 gold on the AH but imo it's absolutely worth it to fill in the gap between 30 and 60. The sooner you buy it, the less you'll have to spend (normally).
---
So if a server doesn't die then should sharding be a permanent solution for that server? That sounds great! Really awesome classic WoW experience.
---
The fact you can't tell this is an issue for sharding just as much as it is an issue for increased server population is pathetic. The correct solution is to adjust the server population to a more realistic median once the game's popularity settles. Whether or not sharding is in the game at any time, this is the only solution other than permanent sharding.
---
You will be able to get invited to a group, and join that groups layer.
---
someone get that guy a beta account so he can find a new place by the time it ends
---
&gt;but this is fucking Deadmines and that's Uldir
---
I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean. Deadmines is a pretty famous dungeon. Not much party content has been streamed yet. I think Asmon's group was one of the first (if not the first?) to stream it. It's perfectly analogous to Uldir, in the sense that it was the first raid of the expansion pack.
---
And it's literally the second fucking day of the beta. Second day of people getting to observe actual Classic content. Uldir released months into the expack.
---
People are excited and look forward to trying out Classic; of course. Doesn't mean a single ounce of a thing for its success, though. People might get the false impression.
---
I agree, I don't think this is a bug.  Very old memories, but I remember farming Un'goro tar elementals on a fire mage, and eat/drinking while in root.
---
According to some.
---
Why in god's name would you have tradechat open? On the other hand, the vast majority of people I have talked to are at least a little excited about it. Ironically, the ones that aren't are the ones who actually played it.
---
One solution is to open a RPvP server and allow free transfers.
---
Those that matter, yes.
---
So your worry is that the top tier won't have to use the auction house as much?
---
Draenei? On my classic wow subreddit?
---
I didn't get an email still 24hours later, but from experience with other F&amp;F alphas etc. I never get an email. The email arrives once the BETA starts normally for expansions. Obviously this is already called BETA and not F&amp;F Alpha or whatever but from what I gathered this was purely manual invite basis only, the first wave anyway.
---
Sheeps were able to be broken on thorns damage.
---
We did that in Legion with Sharding. If one of our guildies was in a preferable shard then we had them invite us to it.
---
More like expecting consistency.
---
Harder doesn‚Äôt mean a better game. Otherwise everyone would be playing that ultra Korean tempo game or Starcraft at 2000 apm
---
You need to learn the jump shot. You do not shoot at the enemy standing still while kiting.
---
It basically goes like this.
---
1. Run away from enemy
---
2. Switch to mouse control (holding both left + right mouse makes you run straight).
---
3. Jump and while in mid air flick your wrist to rotate your character around and shoot either arcane shot or concussive shot
---
4. Everytime you use concussive shot, you can probably allow 1 auto shot rotation to occur
---
5. Dont use aspect of the cheat. Use aspect of the monkey. If you get hit with cheetah, you get dazed and are dead
---
6. Use wing clip whenever they close range
---
7. Save feign death + ice trap for when they close range (frost trap sucks, unless in multi person pvp).
---
So you met these people on one layer, and the next day you're on a separate layer? Aren't you still counting several events happening out of your control?
---
This is something im debating. Do i want to just beat most players to 60? I have hopes of running a guild and i feel doing a dungeon here and there would increase my odds of recruiting 
---
The othee route is balls to the wall leveling getting to level 30 on day 2..
---
Computers in general are just a fad that people are going to get over real soon. Trust me, I've been around the block once or twice.
---
Dual spec would be a pretty large change. Having to pay for spec swapping was a major gold sink, as well as an incentive to hybridise your build somewhat instead of just min-maxing.
---
I don't know that it would be a bad change, but it'd certainly be a change.
---
Mass looting could also be argued to speed up the pace of farming in many cases. Much smaller change though. Mini-map tracking fix, though, would be lovely.
---
The agi difference in the end is minimal. Especially for hunters who need ~55 agi per crit.
---
I think Staysafe may have beaten him to it
---
Once they see the success, they will implement fresh server re-releases... Diablo season style, but very long term.
---
I expect the skill floor to be higher in 2019 than 2004. Guides for everything and better hardware. MC will take hardcore guilds less than an hour
---
Similarly I was playing in my dads lap on his Resto sham around 3-4 now I‚Äôm 18  and I still play occasionally but without insane supervision
---
He's even in Europe. I was gonna say "missed it by a day" but then realized lol.
---
retail subreddit is a cesspool right now. They hate everything about Classic.
---
I imagine if there was ever a nerf, it would be in from day 1 on classic, since it uses the 1.12 client. But I will say that I did a lot of pvp right up to the release of TBC and shadowmeld was ALWAYS a nasty shock for hordies. Especially when combined with well-placed traps and stealthed cat pets. Mmmm... good stuff.
---
That's exactly my concern, thanks!
---
This gives me the warm fuzzies.
---
"past 3 days"
---
Classic has been out for less than 25 hours.
---
Fuck I chose a wrong path
---
0/30/21 you can tank any 5-man and OT in raids, farm as a cat and heal in most raids. You will need lots of gear sets though
---
Elitist jerk, lol.
---
Referring to people who don‚Äôt identify as gender binary as ‚Äòit‚Äô is really messed up..
---
Yeah, I guess we gotta find out.
---
Depends if Soda is streaming or not.
---
The chat functions will be linked, to find people for your dungeon, for example. People could very easily talk in chat to figure out what layer they are, add them, or perhaps there would be a discord database, and then have somebody to whisper anytime you need an out of your instanced world. 
---
My thoughts on this are similar to loot trading. 100% loot trading was bad, we complained, Blizz reverses course. 100% layering is bad, community should complain, and then I hope they reverse course and only layer the more trivial 1-30 than the entire game for 3 months.
---
&gt; Notice how he pulled without telling the healer.
---
Healers job to stay up with the tank, cant keep up then tell the tank
---
&gt;Healer was too far away to actually heal him.
---
Healers job to be within range
---
&gt;Healer wasn't at 100% mana because they just finished fighting the boss right before and Soda was still looting.
---
Should tell the tank to not pull or sit down and drink.
---
Tank is a retard but not **that** much of a retard, especially when the rest of the group are casuals
---
Finally someone actually starts PvPing
---
Yeah, that's another example of a valuable resource to farm many times over. Thank you.
---
Sorry about your childhood amnesia, bro. It's normal, but it's not the default state of humanity.
---
&gt; Shadowmeld is ~~gimmicky~~*awesome* and ~~not useful~~*awesome* in 95% of situations.
---
I think it stems from the fact that we have had so many videos, posts, guides, streams, debates, etc., where someone who doesn't know what they're talking about provides erroneous information. If this person is positioning theirself as a representative or authority on Classic WoW, this poses a bit of a problem. 
---
For example, the official forums had at least one guy telling everyone that Joana's speedrun record could easily be beaten by more than a day -- but this was on a private server. If you try to explain to everyone that leveling on a p-server is not representative of what will be possible in Classic, the offender in question generally doubles down and insists they are correct. Arguing ensues. 
---
Acquiring correct information is obviously beneficial to our success in game. So the community acts to weed out the bullshit. Also, if an individual didn't play vanilla *and* has spoken negatively about it or its design, they will be weeded out too.
---
For what it's worth the very first wave to my knowledge was manual invite only.
---
Hey, I played in '04.....and I am back in school again....brain gains.
---
I had 17 hours on a lvl 20 solo warrior run recently.  
---
9 sounds somehow crazy, I'ld love to see a screenshot with the /played though.
---
Hell of a thing to judge someone by a fucking red hat they wear lol.
---
I love wearing my red cyrillic  make america great again hat just to troll dumb ass motherfuckers like you.
---
staysafe doesn't have shit on [themechanic](https://clips.twitch.tv/EndearingSillyLEDAMPEnergy)
---
Because Vanilla WoW is SRSBSNS and some Zoomer telling a Veteran "how it really was in Vietnam" is insulting.
---
Cool, thanks :)
---
FUCK
---
Is this within an addon? Don't want anyone getting banned for what they just did the giant ban wave in Live for.
---
Modify game files is against the TOS so i would just be careful
---
31 points fury, 20 points prot (or 5 in arms for deflection). It's a max TPS build that was really only discovered within the last year. You tank dual wielding, and you get Defiance for the extra 15% threat, and the TPS you get makes 20 second boss kills possible. It requires really geared healers before you can use it (like 5/8 Tier 2).
---
&gt; but I can absolutely guarantee you
---
You can't. Humans are variable. Your experiences are your own. We're not all on the same ride through life.
---
Will they be *more* tanky or less though. I thought I heard someone say that private servers artificially increased the difficulty a bit just to be safe?
---
Like, could have been 2 or 3, better make it 3. Even though some of the time it had to have been 2.
---
This did not work on Staysafe‚Äôs stream.
---
It‚Äôs exploiting the system. Whoever manages to exploit it the best will corner the black lotus market, and near launch, that is a lot of control. Flasks are hard to come by, and the more one group exploits it, the less there are to go around, and the more other people are encouraged to exploit too.
---
No they actually did it. You typed /pizza and it opened up pizzahut.com
---
Yeah, but we already gave our answers in the *other* tmog thread today.
---
20/25k
---
You sort of get a feel for who is going to get bored or frustrated and wipe you out of incompetence, or refuse to take directions and wipe you out of spite. Those people you either kick right away or they will ruin the run later when half the bosses are dead and then nobody will want to to join the half-finished run so it's over.
---
Say it's the first few pulls of Ulda and the rogue won't wait to let the tank get threat, and keeps demanding heals when they pull aggro. I guarantee that you aren't finishing the dungeon unless you kick that rogue and replace them.
---
By the time you are sixty, if you do all the dungeons you're either on a lot of people's friends list as a reliable player, or a lot of people's block lists as a menace who should never be grouped with.
---
nice timing. congrats!
---
This sub 1 month ago: NO CHANGES!!!
---
This sub after beta: Changes are totally okay, my favorite streamer said this change is great!
---
Looking like a clown is an integral part of the Classic experience
---
It's fucking stupid.
---
Oh I'm not disproving that just saying he got ganked like literally 10 min before this was uploaded
---
I bet you have. I'm gonna get off the xbox if you dont mind tho, have a good one m8.
---
It's confirmed the wow tokens wont be in if you watch that dev interview from the day before beta opened.
---
Dwarf is the best. Stoneform gives you a sort of Freedom from Rogue poisons,  allowing you to kite without being slowed. It also removes Blind.
---
Dwarf Hunter is a rogue killing machine.
---
one of the obvious reasons is that you cant tell what gear someone has just by looking at them, so if you were to go up to lets say a warrior, they could be transmogged to random tier 1 pieces or something like that but actually be a full t3 naxx geared warrior and shit on you and you had no clue, theres a few other reasons but tbh i dont really wanna explain them all again since these posts pop up every few hours
---
It wasn‚Äôt in classic
---
Man, that is quite an uptick. Nice!
---
You are literally watching grass grow to pass the time?
---
Buddy...
---
If a realm gets too full, its name goes red, it reads "High" under population, it gets moved to the bottom of the list and if you pick it you get a pop-up warning you of potential server queues. No?
---
And like I said, if the realm is really really overpopulated even after launch spike, you offer those people "stuck" on that realm a free transfer - solved.
---
Didn't see, sorry
---
I don't have it pulled up, but wasn't that video made before they announced the phases?
---
Looks like we got ourselves another he/she that didn't play back in the real vanilla days. Lol trying to say he/she doesn't care.
---
No but seriously it's gonna be amazing dude. People just like to poke fun at people making stuff up, and other people like making stuff up. Don't worry about it
---
But at that extent, will subs really drop enough after 3 months to have no layering, and not look back? I worry we will hit phase 2, and still have a 5-6k pop. I don‚Äôt think the subs are going to die as much as Blizz thinks.
---
I didn't refer to any person as "it" it was literally just ment as anyone at all, even a plant. 
---
What's messed up is that you found a way to get offended in a sentence that wasn't intended to offend anyone.
---
I played a NE rogue through all of vanilla and then some. Was planning in UD rogue this time but part of me wants to do pally healing. I dunno yet
---
Hi, /u/lbaol
---
"Tips out, Baby!" xD
---
I loved it, even though his chest armor was broken, he got fucking annihilated right there. This is the real classic WoW: get good (and pay attention) or gtfo. Finally, failure is a possible outcome, even at low levels, you're going back to being a shit on your own and the elite mobs will stomp you 1v1.
---
God I hope this stay like this on launch.
---
Remember it could be something the private servers have wrong as well.
---
Doubt it
---
But...all the trolls told me that Classic will have only a few thousand players and be dead in a month! HOW COULD THIS BE HAPPENING??
---
Checks out actually.
---
They really aren‚Äôt. The people you‚Äôre referring to are a vocal minority. This sub is so fucking cancerous.
---
You're really proving to me how much trump supporters aren't assholes right now.
---
especially this part
---
&gt;just to troll dumb ass motherfuckers like you.
---
Just a troll bro! I'm definitely not voting for a racists and sexists piece of garbage because I'm also a piece of garbage.
---
Yea okay dude.
---
If it wasnt in classic, it doesnt need to be in classic. That's the damn reason.
---
If people dont like classic as it was in 1.12 then they shouldn't play it. You have xmog on retail go farm old shit and use it there.
---
You sure are stupid if you couldn't figure out what he was trying to say. I figured it out in 2 seconds and you left this comment an hour ago without deleting it.
---
Sorry mate.
---
If you're trying to say that WoW viewers will exceed League after Classic has been out for 3 days then please feel free to remind me in 2 days. The site I looked at did not have a 1-day option.
---

---
I look forward to revisiting this.
---
&gt;Dungeons:  
---
&gt;There is no water present in the Ironclad Cove area of the Deadmines dungeon
---
Yeah I just noticed this a little earlier today watching Asmongold's VC run on Twitch.  He did end up sending a bug report.
---
I definitely don‚Äôt think it will either.
---
And at that point, I‚Äôd much rather than lower the max pop on servers and simply add more servers with free transfers to those servers.  
---
But if that‚Äôs not what happens, they will at least have a month or so to fine tune spawn rates and everything, so that lower pop realms and higher pop realms won‚Äôt be getting screwed over.
---
I see that it's a lvl 57 neutral quest in the Blasted Lands, but I can't seem to find what it gives as a reward. Why do you consider it a must do quest?
---
...why are you so desperately trying to devalue the "#1" statement?
---
Yes. But every other intelligent, well-crafted guide out there has an asterisk or some sort of notice that PvP rewards are subject to progression.
---
And he's still gets weapons wrong, like Sarah's Guide and whatnot.
---
It impacts the economy.  When transmog was introduced auction house prices for moggable gear skyrocketed and never really came back down. This market didn't exist line this pre-cata.
---
Secondly, there is a gameplay element.  In vanilla you couldn't see enemy health.  There was an addon that estimated enemy health based on damage you inflicted, but obviously you had to engage to determine that number. Before mob health was implemented players used visual cues to size up an opponent of similar level, and that was visible equipment. 
---
Whether these are a big deal or not isn't relevant. Gameplay is, in my opinion, off the table and transmog tangibly alters that.
---
That they were!
---
You play classic on the same subscription as retail, meaning you can play classic for free assuming you farm out the gold in retail that's about it buying gold, character boosting, mounts ect will not be a part of the classic store according to a recent interview however things like character transfers and race swapping is being talked about.
---
A colorblind clown, mind you
---
So #alittlebitofchanges?
---
Comparing Vanilla to Vietnam. 
---
You are literally the representation of what's wrong in this sub.
---
Miss rate should not be nearly as that high, should be around 12% or so? I think +3 levels was 9%. With parries/dodges included you might be close, which might be what you were thinking.
---
Literally voting for yang or bernie. Once again judging someone by a fucking hat is a retarted idea.
---
How‚Äôs that bm? That‚Äôs classic for you baby enjoy it :) sometimes u will get body camped for hours and won‚Äôt even be able to play on that toon hahaha
---
I know like 4 people have already replied but i didn't see anyone mention that twitch prime subs are worth less to the streamer (idk why they are valued less, maybe just cuz it is "free")
---
MP5 and HP5 added to your natural regen.  They ticked on the normal 2s tick.  People get confused about it because of the name and the 5s rule.
---
There were no visible stats by default, but there were expanded/detailed character stat addons that would let you see all of those things.
---
Paid transfers didn't happen in vanilla WoW until way late it's it's run, close to if not around the time the TBC patch came out. 
---
Again, why was a huge issue with vanilla the fact that there were so called "farm guilds" for the top guilds on the servers, because people had to poach from other guilds to fill a raid roster. My guild would have loved to try and recruit from other servers, but it was not possible. And when they did add it in (again, late into the vanilla life cycle) there was a 6 month CD on it.
---
I actually never watched a streamer before yesterday. 
---
Again, this is going to be a month+ long beta. Spending 48 hours having a fun community race is not a big deal at all.
---
Imagine being this salty over literally nothing.
---
thats very surprising and great news
---
i expected blizz to try and monetize through tokens on top of the sub
---
I just went over there to see and all I gotta say is WoW they are super salty. Its crazy
---
It differed depending on the server and what they set the values in the database. Some had it lower, some had it higher.
---
If people opt into the beta they would indicate they're interested wouldn't they? Although there'd be an issue of people making tons of accounts to try improve their odds, but that could be fixed by adding parameters to how they give out keys if they aren't already
---
37, wife, daughter almost 2, cat, plus at work 30 hours a week, cause no babysitters.
---
If I can do it, you can do it, anything's possible in classic when you role healer lol
---
Praying for Joana!
---
Lol. Ima have to name my Hunter Chriskyle now.
---
Well you have to manually sign into your account to enable ‚Äúclassic wow beta‚Äù that was a new addition. So while there may be dead accounts, only interested people are making the switch right? 
---
Also from reading more of this thread it looks like people have been invited to the beta without an active sub. Not sure the validity of that fully though.
---
For a while after they released the new models they allowed you to swap between the two. I don't know why they don't give that option with classic.
---
You'll do it a few times, it's nbd though
---
Amazing that people don't seem to even know this. God damn wrath babbies
---
Im staying out of there, the hate replies when you even mention classic is real.
---
For the money. Introduced a cash shop, made things easier so new players wouldnt struggle.
---
Detecting humor is not your strong suit.
---
SRSBSNS is all the /s anyone needs. Or maybe "only 2004 wow players will get this"
---
You in the same breath judge me fore voting for someone, while telling me not to judge people from voting for someone else.
---
The only difference is the person you don't want me to judge supports your racist candidate, you don't seem very self aware.
---
I guess you'd never judge someone for having a bernie sticker on their car? Or maybe some socialist symbols? Yea right.
---
Symbol represent ideas dum dum.
---
That was lighting.  When cata redesigned everything lightinf changed big time.   Weather was gone by bc
---
If you run out in a group most people are cool about it, even letting you run and restock.
---
You have a point there. Idk I guess the way I see it, if I were blizzard I would feel better about choosing participants that love the classic game enough to support blizzard in order to have the chance to test. There two strong sides to the argument I suppose.
---
Taking "mom! bathroom!" to the next level
---
It was in the game for an entire expansion...
---
Yes 4.99 and its 50/50.  They label it quite clearly
---
Hahaha. Damn what a baddie. And he plays horde 2. Who's doesnt know this basic shit
---
Its so funny. Like they are trying to clasp on to a dead game which is pretty much only a husk of its former self
---
At the same time. This just deadmines. This isn‚Äôt Naxx, or AQ 40, it‚Äôs not even BWL, it‚Äôs not even MC. Friggen 100 000 people just tuned in for deadmines lol. That‚Äôs pretty epic and a sign of good things to come. 
---
You‚Äôre right though, in and of itself this isn‚Äôt proof of anything. But it‚Äôs also not like this was the most epic thing this game has to offer.
---
Warriors could not charge around anything and they could charge around everything. Charge follows the laws of physics from an alternate universe and no human could ever comprehend the mechanics.
---
Still worth it I think.  I'll graduate this December at 39.  
---
I've noticed over the couple of internships that I've had, they tend to trust me with a lot more than my traditional college-age peers.  I'm not saying we're not behind the curve at this point in our lives, but life experience and maturity carry some value.
---
That was me actually in TBC (I didn't play vanilla), 45 with two kids and a career. I found a nice casual raiding (is that an oxymoron?) guild and had a great time. We raided two nights per week. One weekday and one weekend day. What made it work for us was that our core players, and guild leaders, were hardcore raiders on their mains in other guilds. It was their alts that pulled us through the content. But if you know your class and the fights then there's no reason you can't raid again. Even casual noob me was able to semi-regularly top the DPS charts.
---
female night elf obviously
---
well if there are server wide layers to increase server pop and the pop does not drop enough before phase 2 when they turn off layers it could obviously cause issues.
---
if servers were going to go full at vanilla numbers i think they would use a different system
---
layers are their solution because they expect high numbers of players to quit very early , which is true but its a bit of a gamble how many people will be left per server
---
Is it not ‚Äúkeep your feet on the ground‚Äù or have I been wrong all these years?
---
How about we all just get along and stop talking shit about other communities.
---
Captain Placeholder, what a treat!
---
killing the same mobs i need for my quest? say goodbye.
---
Given the information available it seems like everyone in this thread is "desperately" trying to inflate the value of the "#1" statement.
---
So I would ask you, why is it so important for you to try to hush the voice of truth?
---
Thanks for the constructive criticism. That's an actual great idea.
---
Here's a tip for your build:
---
Do rogue crit?
---
Activision-Blizzard is putting in a reporting system in Classic WOW.  Game is dead or will implode depending on the implementation.
---
Yeah didn't know what srsbsn ment.
---
RIP thread.
---
Leads to shard of afrasa and You are Rakh'likh, Demon
---
Sunder and expose armor never stacked and expose armor fucked up sunder.  This is not new.
---
I believe other armor reductions such as curse of recklessness and faerie fire will stack though.  However, faerie fire and feral faerie fire will not stack with each other.
---
Reason I think is that mobs weren't pulling from below bridge or from other floors from what I saw, they should but they weren't.
---
I believe original vanilla had the same bug p servers did that caused mobs to pull through floors which made it harder.
---
Bfa client doesn't seem to have it
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
&gt; (or at least, as many people as claim to)
---
Read the whole fucking thing next time champ :)
---
&gt; but even BFA had huge numbers on release.
---
So did WoD. And then they dropped off pretty sharply, right back down to what they were pre-launch, and then dropped further.
---
I had to check myself hard. I just almost jumped on your ass for claiming that undead mages has devouring plague.
---
I apologize for my head thoughts
---
player reputation matters in classic and your gear being an authentic representation of your accomplishments is part of that.
---
Unfortunately not. It seems like he's removed the post.
---
upgrade?
---
no thanks!
---
And where are you getting that number from exactly? You do understand fury has plenty of talents that just straight up increase your damage right?
---
oh sweet worth it for barrens chat. x roads foreva!
---
What i really like in diablo 2 is looking at randoms at my party and knowing exactly what build and gear theyre using, just like i like to show of a bit my farming.
---
Right? How is this even a debate... Huge DPS boost.
---
As hype as I am for classic (which is a lot), this hardly means much. Any start of a beta/expansion will see a huge uptick in viewers that eventually will taper off some.
---
I do love to see how much the streamers and the viewers seem to be enjoying the game. I expected more trolls and idiots in chat but I haven't seen much of them.
---
You needed eight at the end, not four, and all eight ideally had enough t3 to get one of the set bonuses
---
&gt; LOL fucking SOURCE?
---
1. [Right click reporting saves them money on support staff, which they have been downsizing and firing people. As far as we know, still in the game.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769607966)
---
2. [Loot Trading also saves them money on support staff costs. They reduced this dramatically but is still in the game](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290819/loot-trading-in-classic-wow)
---
3. [Layering saves them money on servers and how they support it.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769688603)
---
&gt; AGAIN I ask you, how many times does the classic team have to prove themselves?
---
I appreciated them reconsidering loot trading for the most part. The graphics look amazing. But so far I am not impressed their gameplay decisions. They have layering which is blatantly not Vanilla. I hope they get rid of it before phase 2, but I have a sinking feeling about it. If it's gone sooner I will be pleasantly surprised. If that happens I will admit I was completely wrong.
---
&gt;You just can't stop making baseless assumptions and preaching it as fact, whether it's hypothetical exploits that will for sure make it to production
---
First, I am not saying it will "for sure make it to production". I already said I hope they mitigate it somehow. It's not baseless. It's based on how these systems have been explained to work. I explained to you how the exploits would work.
---
I believe that even if they had increased the armor, allowing expose to stack with sunder would be massive compared to what was in original WoW.
---
This is the sad truth one must realize about blizzard.  Classic might be the last "for the players" game we ever get from this smash and grab company.  That's until they MTX the hell out of Classic some how.  I mean, they're already charging people for just a chance to get into a beta lol.
---
I was in school in 2005 and still am lol, I took a couple of years of in between schools though.
---
&gt;"voice of truth"
---
That's rich, coming from someone who immediately shot down the claims with "haha it was just people opening a stream for 2 minutes".
---
Agree with the shitty memes and retail trashtalk part, but transmog threads is known as unpopular in vanilla community (for reasons discussed on tons of threads here and all around the web). Nothing too surprising to see it downvoted.
---
It stands for "serious business" and was used prominently during Vanilla WoW as a term for when something is taken too seriously.
---
99% cant play so they watch and it is literally 1 day after beta release. It makes for nice title to post on this circlejerk of subreddit but ultimately means fuck all
---
no, bigger streamers get a higher cut of around 2.99/3 idk why you cant accept that
---
Imagine getting this angry over a videogame being successful.
---
If you've been following the development of classic wow, and the communication with the classic devs, it would have been surprising if they *were* to add tokens to classic.
---
They tuned in for something new. The dungeon didn't matter.
---
If we had to apologize for our head thoughts, I would be in BIG trouble
---
everyone looked so garbage it was something special when you got tier sets and started looking good
---
the pure loot lust people wanted better gear for a lot of reasons
---
looking good was one of them
---
That's just because it takes more time to build castles than it does to put up a few huts with spikes on them.
---
Ive read that people partnered with twitch get a 60/40 split on regular T1 and above subscriptions, but for twitch prime it remains 50/50.
---
&gt;you fucking yank
---
Aww little man upset they get looked over for not being American?
---
Uses potion
---
"He potted? Hes a pussy!"
---
Its a joke i know he was already in disadvantage.
---
Yeah, you are probably right.
---
I was planning to roll mage, but now after watching your intro video makes me to roll warrior again (was pretty tryhard by wasting time getting new dungeon upgrades+eng). Used vanilla guide, but it was like you said made for less gear dependent classes and made leveling even harder.  Maybe if a friend goes healer I might have to abandon my aoe ez life plan.
---
Also: Even at low resists, you can still get lucky and proc a 75% resist. 
---
Some monsters also used to have really broken abilities, some hitting harder than average, others doing nearly nothing. Wasn't quite as predictable back then.
---
The streamer clearly enjoyed that interaction lol
---
Played both factions and raided on both hardcore. Much less time now and a life so just staying on alliance as they are far easier with most things and have the better raid comps.
---
&gt;Not sure why you're here if you hate Classic so much. Stay seething :)
---
Ah so you are just a run of the mill troll looking to slip a "umadbro?" into a conversation that you would otherwise have nothing to contribute.
---
Well I am sorry to disappoint you but I am very much looking forward to Classic. I just don't see the need for people to make wild click-bait claims about WoW being #1 on Twitch.
---
Usually once a week they have a tacked thread on the front page of the subreddit.
---
But for your question, I would say rogue. Fireballs and slow poison! Or a druid would be good for the heals/tank/
---
now that we have legit server, with legit rates, legit quest routing, etc. all else is immaterial.
---
Now that is fucking nostalgia!
---
Dwarf for pvp.
---
NE for pve i guess
---
It's usually 2 druids in every raid. A third one (feral) may join if the guild is okay with it. So 2 resto druids and sometimes 1 feral too.
---
That list is very sparse.  Either Blizzard has done a great job recreating the game, the testers are testing poorly, or there's slow communication between bug reports and Blizzard.
---
Apparently his chestpiece was broken after dying a bunch of times after missing the jump twice and getting lost.
