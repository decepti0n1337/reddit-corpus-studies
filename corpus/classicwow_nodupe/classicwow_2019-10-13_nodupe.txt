So are paladins all about +heal on their gear then, seeing as they almost never run out of mana?
---
Massive Hillsbrad battles.

---
The joy of getting meaningful gear upgrades.
---
Forming groups through chat through advertising and networking. 
---
The meaningful interactions you have with random players while trying to overcome challenging quests.

Nice political wording but this is anti vanilla
---
I think he wants to actually profit from his profession...
---
What a load of bullshit.  Blizzard's standard is establishing concrete proof that someone ninja'd.
---
They should if they're in a PUG.
---
You should view the item for what it is, gold. Everyone could use that item to equally upgrade their gear.
---
The only instance id trust everyone to greed is if my group is all my friends.
---
Otherwise by greeding you're just enabling ninja looters.
---
It may not seem right, but it's the way it is.
---
Okay so the only BoE's you are gonna see dropping in MC is t1 bracers and belt. These are either given out immediately or looted to be given out later. Usually there's a little "hey we got a nightslayer belt sick" in discord.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyway on bosses you can still see what loot drops, usually it's also announced via raid warning. The council either gives it out to whoever they think deserves it, or more commonly they make you link your current item of that slot to show how big an upgrade and to show that you are interested in the item, then gives it out. Typically in the start there will be a good amount of rolling on pieces, sometimes anyone can roll sometimes a select few, this is because it's very hard to judge who deserves what on the first couple of raids, everyone starts out equal, at least for the least important pieces.
---
Post this on your server-specific subreddit.
---
There are 3 different types of bats there, and each has an ability. One fears, one silences, and then there's another I can't remember.
---
Well I made the mistake of thinking "Gray Forest Wolf" was the best starter wolf with its 1.7 attack speed. So that was the first one. Then I realized "Prairie Wolf Alpha" has 1.4 and Furious howl at only lvl 10! So I went all the way over to Mulgore and tamed that guy. 
---
I will eventually switch to Mist Howler when I hit lvl 22 with its 1.3 speed. Hoping that guy follows a little better haha.
---
You say that like archivis cloak is guaranteed to take 50 hours. It is possible that it could drop on someone first run, not likely, but it COULD. It IS guaranteed that you will have to grind for an entire day before you can buy a freezing band, and even then that money might be better spent somewhere else because freezing band is replaced relatively quickly. I guess what I am trying to say is, I will have more fun saving money, and passively making more by taking chances on getting drop loot, then wasting it all on gear that will be replaced. It isnt personally worth it to me. To each his own right?
---
No, I don't think there will be faction or class or race changes.
---
Start rolling a new toon now if you'd like. Enjoy a newjourney in a new set of zones.
---
There's a tone of ways to deal with queue, why would you choose the worst one...
---
You could have someone else log in for you, if you live with family/roommate/gf/bf w/e.
---
You could log in remotely to your pc etc..
---
Log in before the peak hours and so on.
---
Well now you gotta wait and hope!
---
I like to think I have a good server reputation. I try to be one of those friendly and generous types. 
---
I also do really dumb noob shit sometimes and I know I have made a few enemies.
---
I try to make up for it by giving away free bags whenever I'm working on my tailoring.
---
Are the abilities also use strength? or 1 dps is better for mortal strike thank 7 str?
---
We'll get it right, the other’s responsibilities.
---
Wait... what? Even healing specced druids use cat and bear forms.
---
I'd understand if they saw you in oomkin form, but cat?  That's just moronic.
---
lol you are sad
---
Yes! One of the best aspects or no dungeon summoning. The world feels alive.
---
Thex
---
Idk why these guys are crying about this shit now. We had it in vanilla and no one cared, now they act like it's a huge deal. People are just looking for shit to nitpick and complain about. Most of the time they are remembering shit wrong in the first place.
---
People were complaining about guards spawning en masse when you attack civilian npcs in a group, then you find out it was always that way and they were just misremembering.
---
Lol azeroth is flat
---
We realised that Princess is way harder than on p server, but the thing with tribute run is you kite the boss like the princess from Maraudon. So i think it will be easy, because you wont get hit if you kite properly.

Banning healthstone is an attempt to not just give the best lock automaticaly the trophy.
---
How loot council works varies massively. There isn't an exact system, sometimes it's picking who's allowed to roll sometimes it's distributing sometimes a bit of both.
---
But in general, loot council you have to absolutely trust your officers. If you don't, you are going to be in for a rough ride.
---
been a long time since I did it but the various death knights you get quests from had personality iirc they were like gloating and laughinga bout stuff they wanted you to do to the scarlet crusader village.
---
I wish they showed the values of the tie roll!
---
Well you are the one talking about luck in your spreadsheet, on the item that is complete luck versus the item that takes x amounts of hours to farm.
---
Thank you! I'm glad to know that sub exists. I don't have any other good ones yet, but I was struck by the unexpected beauty of the landscape, and the framing was too good not to take a snap of!

Blood Frenzy is completely useless until level 36, because there's never will be a good situation to cast Rip)  
---
Better cast another Claw\Shred.  
---
Yes, for feral DPS resto not needed. 0/30/21 is a dual spec, for people who know what they are doing. They keep two sets of gear - one with int/spirit and one with agi/str.  
---
But it's much more easier to play as Cat/bear - do quests as a cat, tank dungeons as bear. 
---
With a build like this - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5050320313222151-05
---
Maybe make an alt and get a feel for a different class? Sometimes variation is what's needed. :)
---
We also got Double Dal'rends ... i won both... best day
---
way to many rules and boring BS for a tournament in a game that is literally rock paper warlock
---
The abilities use the weapon damage after the affect of attack power has been calculated. So yes strength also helps your abilities, some abilities even scale of attackpower itself, not the weapon damage, for example bloodthirst :)
---
You Fucking lost me with “I don’t care for memes.” Now I’m going to post the screen shot of my brother and I getting our first mounts in 15 years.
---
You get a lot of people making alts who have speed run mentality.
---
Yeah happens to me too, but only sometimes. You can somehow reset this behavior by sending the pet to attack another creature and then immediately ordering it to return to you.
---
&gt; UnGoro and WPL are cant miss quest areas for 51-35
---
Not sure I want to go to zones that make you lose 16 levels...
---
I think I'm gonna bust once I finally drink my first 55 water
---
You asked for "items available" and you're mad that he gave you one, along with an explanation of why it's better than a combination of weapons that rely on an enchant that is *not available*? You got corrected. Move on.
---
All about +crit.
---
Crits are what returns the mana.  +healing is nice but not the main thing to want
---
The first known Teebu's Blazing Longsword dropped on 9/21. If anyone can find an earlier example then it'd good to post.
---
How much? They are under a silver on Tfury and when im out questing and the bags fill up these are among the first to go.
---
Also stats.  
---
You get +16 all stats and +27 resistance at max level.
---
Then you should be good, I've been watching videos of stealth runs and that seems to be the case, just not sure on the last door
---
This but unironically
---
Reeeeeee Zelda is the princess, the guy is Link reeeeeeeee

Mage is pretty fun, warrior aswell, but you probably have to open your own groups if you want to play dps warrior( atleast on my Realm it seems that noone wants dps warrior in dungeons)

This totally makes me want roll a warrior again.
---
I've got full bis for prot and fury.So but i mostly play fury in raids.It's just something i collected on the side
---
Level 27 rogue here what are the best/ must have macro’s? New to WoW btw
---
Usually if you can’t use it, you greed. If you can, you need.
---
Im playing boomie and i always have people telling me im the first one they have seen :p
---
Anybody who doesn’t roll need on a high value item is making themselves vulnerable to a ninja. Just roll need and if you get the item against people who rolled greed open it up to them to roll for it.
---
That’s how you do it if you want to protect yourself, and not be a dick to your group.
---
Anyone who doesn’t roll need though on a high value item shouldn’t complain when the inevitable need roll comes and they auto-lose.
---
I hope so. 
---
I was very worried Deviant Delight would become dead and wanted to move to Grobbulus but the community is thriving and its become a lovely RP community. 
---
Rooting for you! I hope they do merges or payed transfers. 
---
Personally I think merges would be better.
---
&gt; I still can't attack it so i have to right-click it and then that's the prev. problem
---
You should tab out earlier. Don't hit mob until it's dead, it's not your job.  
---
You should switch to other target as soon as mob have less than 10% hp. Even if DPS will get aggro - they will finish him without your help.
---
What a spineless reply. Fuck Blizzard and fuck the Chinese government.
---
It's that the garbage way they're emulating the vanilla spell-batching you can't be sure the server will still see the tank as alive when your cast finally goes through. 
---
I'm sure it's the same bug that makes mobs evade my succubus when she attacks out of invis cause when they try to attack they still see her as invisible even though it's impossible for her to still be invisible after attacking.
---
Honestly, in MC, None of the bossfights should last longer then 1 minute, bar Rag and Majordomo. Running out of mana should only be a thing if the group is terrible or if people are SERIOUSLY slacking(which by the way happens a lot, and I catch level 60 geared mages being outdamaged by level 57 green geared melee dps).
---
Some of us aren't that hardcore and just wanted to play a game that didn't require hours of waiting or the things you mentioned.
---
If going for servers I would allways choose the biggest ones, or those that favour your faction the most regardless of other factors.
---
Go and check on that yourself: https://realmpop.com
---
If you care about RP then choose a bigger RP Server.
---
Basing serverchoice on the name is not as effective, look at its community and the economy - then settle down!
---
I don't know if there will be a -classic- WotLK at all. Doesn't seem like it tbh. So there might never be Deathknights again in WoW. A little bit sad, given that I mained a DK for the longest time playing wow and allways will be maining him! \o/
---
If you're stuck on Horde then yes indeed an Orc Warrior would be great and its Axe Spec synergizes very well with passive 5% Krit from Arms spec as well as your Whirlwind Axe and Ravager form SM Arsenal. Stun immunity is really strong for pvp too.
---
I buff everyone I see to keep the beggars away.
---
If you are in danger of overhealing it is honestly better to cancelcast until the tank has taken enough damage to benefit from your most efficient heal, which is at 0 +healing is your highest ranked Healing Touch. There's no benefit to keeping the tank at max health all the time - they just need to be high enough not to die.
---
No you cannot stealth to them.
---
Hide UI.
---
It's breaking so many things and I'm getting worried that they seem to be trying to fix the bugs one by one (like hunters FD/Trap combo) while ignoring the thing causing them all in teh first place.
---
iirc you have to kill the last boss
---
You’d rather everyone just be quiet and keep their happiness to themselves ?
---
Report them back for supporting hong kong
---
Non snowflake just means you are not special or unique in anyway
---
Speak with guards, they will point you to weaponmaster in Darnassus.  
---
And you could ask weaponmaster about other masters, that teach different weapons.
---
By the way, what's name of unit frames addon?
---
I farmed Hoj the other night. Did 8 runs and saw it drop three times (I was fortunate enough to win the third time). Hopefully you’re luck improves!
---
5-8 per run. 5 runs an hour.
---
I am dying once in a while and getting ganked here and there, you see it in the lvl 40 time of like 7 hours to level.  I hit Desolace , and the area by Uldaman was a bloodbath.
---
Because SM cath farming is the best way to get your mount lol
---
All the groups I've been in have given first pick to the ones with the profession. Groups and servers may vary though
---
Good to see this.  I messed up my skinning in that I didn't level it with the zones... so now it's stuck and I'll have to go back and level that. :)
---
GENIUS
---
Rules ruin what is fun about that match up, the mind games.
---
No it does not matter if the spellpower is from "magical abilities" of one school in particular, the spell power coefficient is the same.
---
I’ve gotten priority on a couple enchanting recipes a few times in dungeons, but not on expensive ones. Expensive ones everyone all needs most of the time, and maybe the guy in your group who won it will give you a discount if you want to buy if off him.
---
Just my experience.
---
You think that don’t you, but I switched the potions when your back was turned.
---
The ghost one is seriously really cool.
---
There's an advanced options add-on that makes the cvars easier to navigate and has check boxes for quite a few. That's how I found the ghost one.
---
Perfect, this is exactly what I was trying to do. I was struggling with finding the proper syntax for if statements
---
Yes, I try to stay busy and keep the pet moving (I send him to the next mob, put a sting on them, grab the loot...) but I run out of mana at times, so I probably need to do a little better using melee attacks.
---
Hey man you can live in the tallest tower of the highest castle in the nicest kingdom, if you keep raining buffs on us common folk we're happy
---
Lesser invisibility potion, or always enter from orange.
---
Watch a few tutorials, but note that all mushrooms spawns inside the dungeon are pickable without the need to kill mobs. A lot of guides say a few mushroom spawns can not be picked without aggro, to them i say git gud.
---
Good to know... I feel like everyone is 60.  The days of DM runs, Stocks, SM etc. are long gone on this server.  Most zones I'm in are dead.
---
It's not really shown in-game, but it's heavily implied through quest texts that part of the reason why the crusade is hostile to the alliance is that they (in no small part due to Balnazzars corrupting influence) consider *every* non-scarlet who happens to be in Lordaeron an acceptable target. Infected or otherwise. So yeah, of course the Scarlet Crusade is bad. Not because they kill forsaken or members of the scourge, but because of the methods they use (killing them is one thing, capturing and torturting them is another) and because they don't discriminate between infected and completely healthy humans, elves and whatnot. They're a prime example of an organisation with relatable, understandable goals, that 'lost the way' a while ago.
---
I asked for items available outside of a raid, not items available right now.
---
If you have to invent me saying shit to prove me wrong, then maybe you're the one who needs to move on.
---
Our guild (shout-out Morning Tea on ZT) has a Boomkin that is in our first team raid squad. He was in the screenshot for our first Rag kill and rolled a load of cool gear in our first couple of runs. There's something about seeing a Boomkin standing over a Rag corpse that really tickles me.
---
Any quest that has high mob density and where you can't avoid pulling 2+ mobs at once.
---
Enemy design in WoW (poisons, diseases, stuns, etc.) really favors ranged classes over melee. As a hunter you're almost never affected and if your pet is, you can easily cure it.
---
I am using Joana's guide now.... seems like I spend A LOT of time going to major cities... but it's to pick up quests and stuff, which is good because I would never know which ones to get or not get.
---
Is vendorsniping legal? 
---
I guess it is, for the same strange reason as some vendor item stock being limited. 
---
Although I see absolutely no reason for it being this way?
---
Asking this after trying to get a runecloth bag recipe and finding the vendor completely camped with some gnomew asking for 50g. 
---
Oh, and second question, is this the meaning of "you think you do but you don't"?
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
so we'll have to wait for them to release arathi for that? what about the boney looking shoulders many of them have?
---
The spawntime has always been between 11 and 20 mins depending on rng and serverpop.
---
And? The original comment is exactly this point. Dalrends are bis for hunters yet you should let rogues and warriors have them. Same thing here
---
Doesn't really seem like he was being a dick, tbh. Sometimes people won't want to group with you. And that's okay. You learned your lesson. Next time, you'll know to open the dialogue window and hover your mouse over "accept quest" before you try to make things work for everyone.
---
Hah, when I read the part with the low gold income I expected you to just sit around in sw all day wondering why you still only have 150g after being 60 for a week.
---
Tribute runs are supposed to be much better than Maraudon for hunters though.
---
It is if they are botting to do it.
---
A former guildy aptly described it as *Dark Souls without the dodge roll*.
---
I like turtles.
---
Small nitpick but yetis and worgen don’t drop cloth but they do drop coin.
---
Correct currently the armor is not even viewable through the vendor yet there are other pieces that do fit in with the theme but the iconic wood shoulders is from the defilers
---
The context within which Classic operates makes those storylines irrelevant.

So would a macro like this help:

---
    /cast vanish
---
?
---
True but Moonkins where as rare then as they are today. At least from my memory.
---
I've seen a lot less (if any) survival hunters, assassination rogues, fire/arcane mages and elemental shamans which is most likely due to what you're mentioning, meta gaming and min/max-ing.
---
The Liches definitely do, like Kel'Thezud.
---
Most of the intelligent undead show emotions
---
Awesome! Need to save this....
---
I think they can’t proc off each other for the same item. But they will for other extra attacks like thrasher or hand of justice.
---
not addicted, just don't care about hong kong and I support the chinese, fuck those hong kong losers tbqh.
---
but you seriously cant tell who is infected or not, as happened at stratholme. so you cant really blame them for being paranoid, and considering the plaguelands so dangerous why are those individuals there anyhow? and the crusaders are fighting to defeat forsaken and retake lordaeron, pretty good chance if anyone in lordaeron was onboard with that they are a scarlet and if not prob an outright enemy or at least rival 3rd party.
---
I mean that's cool and you should be happy. We don't need these posts. This Is a you and your guild moment.

Nah i'm pretty sure they are all clumped in as "flurry", and do not proc off each other, i read it somewhere years ago.

No one shames people for doing that. Or at least I don't. But I know that there are several issues with the way multiple things work in classic if lets say blizzard would allow transfers for everyone or something similar. And because of these issues they can't do it. These issues are mostly connected with the economy and progress of each server and later on with pvp ranks etc.
---
All I know is that if a server is really dead or close to it, the server will be 99% merged with another one at some point, blizzard wouldn't wanna lose even the small amount of players that play in that server.

He's right about druid tho. Every single button  on my action bar is a macro. There's no automatic form cancelling when you want to cast a spell in classic. So you want a Rejuv out of cat form? Press cat form button to cancel form and then Rejuv button..or macro it into 1 button. To be sure add /stand and /dismount in front so you can Rejuv right out mount or after drinking mana. Now add some modifiers for lower ranks. Druid is fkin macro machine.

The main issue is that it doesn't really make sense. After the demon leader was killed, the organization should have at least been willing to truce with the Alliance while the Undead are still a threat.
---
nah like, they used to proc off each other on retail i think but when they made wf unable to proc off itself they classed them all as the same ability and thus made them all unable to proc off each other aswell.
---
Yes and if you do not establish any loot rules regarding boe's anyone has the right to roll need on them, so if 4 people roll greed and the last person rolls need Blizzard will do absolutely nothing because he was playing by the rules, this is why people like me establish "boe is need" rule when forming groups and avoid unecessary loot drama

Just got Myrmidon's Signet, the bis for a lot of melee (Off a random undead in EPL no less). Unfortunately i'm a priest and have no use for it. I'm trying to gauge how much to sell it for. Any recommendations?
---
Switching to Holy Spec for PvP. Will also be going down the prot tree but I have a question in regards to certain skills there. Is either Improved Devotion Aura or Toughness any good? I've done some readings and it's pretty much mixed opinions. Also anyone recommend any good spec builds?
---
I did this recently, solo (for the most part). First and foremost, make sure to accept the quest before farming for these. They will not drop, unless you have the quest, so dont try to farm in advance. Farming for the Bloodscalp tusks can be a pain, and its probably gonna be, but as others say, if you can get a higher lvl to help you, its gonna be alot quicker.
---
 I recommend be atleast lvl 32 if you as me, are planning on doing it solo for the most, as the trolls are lvl 33-35. Be prepared, STV is a god damn warzone, swarming with both Horde and Alliance, so youre probably gonna do alot of runs to get your corpse. Ill say it took me about 2-3 hours, and thats considering i did it almost entirely solo, and the dropchance of the tusks being fairly reasonably at 35%. 
---
Also, just ask in the generalchat for help if you are getting ganked, i often had someone whisper me and ask where they could meet the gankers, and repay them. Start by just asking for help, then throw some Gs in the request if you dont get replies. Sorry for the long reply, hope it helps.

blackcrow is trash and not worth equipping for hunters.

I believe darions dialogue changes after the lights hope event. But up until that point he remains a loyal servant of his master's bidding. It's when Arthas shows the memory of Darion's father when Alexandros was the Ashbringer to him that he snaps out of it giving him his mind back. It was a betrayal by the Lich king and I'm sure that Arthas sent them there so he could dispose of them because he knew they'd regain their minds eventually, and elite soldiers of the scourge are a recipe for disaster to your own dynasty. They know all the ins and outs as well as weaknesses.

with a windfury coming twice or hoj without a second aa in between, then it's just 1 aa proccing both.

I had a great experience doing Tooga's escort. I was clearing stuff out around him when another player came up. I spam invited fearing the worst and asked if they were doing the escort. Later said 1 sec. A third player shows up and starts the escort. I was annoyed and just typed "..." in say.
---
Turns out the first player that showed up has waiting for that second player. They invited me, abandoned the escort, and waited out the respawn time when they could have easily just been like "oops" and kept it moving.

I don’t have the price, but I do have some unsolicited advice: get the auctioneer addon and do a few scans over a couple of days. it’ll put the market price for any item in its tooltip. Don’t even have to be at the AH to check.  Really useful whenever you run across random loot like this.
---
Well yea, but technically everyone can afford that one when they’re level 60....
---
For a Priest those are very good choices, and you will simply make up for lost gold while leveling with ease of leveling those professions now and making a lot more money from them once you hit the level cap. Right now, Enchanting is great and you can start making real money from it as soon as you hit level 35 (potentially, the main requirement of course is obtaining the recipes for the desirable enchantments.)
---
Swapping for a gathering profession isn't a bad choice either, you can make decent money from skinning while leveling to help afford your mount, but that's a very short term strategy and you may regret it later, depending on how much money you end up spending to level up tailoring/enchanting when you swap back.
---
Personally, I did do skinning and mining while leveling and now I'm max level I rarely find my self benefiting from them and the overall gold I gain from them was useful for a time but its hard to quantify how good it was without keeping track of all the income I made. Lets just so I'm doing okay monetarily for a paladin, but I could be doing a lot better.
---
I hope I helped, its not an easy choice to have to make.

Fake

First time doing the Onyxia raid and we killed her, but I died (I'm a mage). Am I supposed to wear gears with fire resistance instead of pre-BiS gears when I join a raid? And also, how does fire resist work? I.e. what's the equivalent of fire resistance to stamina?
---
I was referring to during the leveling process or just plain casual if it wasn't clear. :D
---
it's a macro that does nothing
---
I got one hoping I could get 90g but my server they are dropping to 60 g
---
what addon is that? would love to track my mob kills
---
This happened to 3 of my group members, all we did to fix it was me bringing a mob over so they could attack it take aggro and die from it.
---
1 less in Queue......
---
If you're going to simulate an open world encounter, then nothing should be off limits.
---
&gt; You were proven wrong
---
You didn't prove a goddamned thing. I said when you're oom, you can't cast FD. You went to "it's insignificant." Tell me, is the cost greater than zero? You have to have some sort of genetic disorder to not understand this concept.
---
Depends on which faction you are part of. It will be worth more on Alliance since horde have an easier time getting venomstrike for WC for their 19 hunter twinks.
---
Im guessing classic codex/questie
---
Your numeracy issues aside, I do wonder why a 'cat cat' would list a server before even making a character...
---
could be tbh i never really got that whole thing like why LK was gonna sacrifice all those death knights
---
And if you are going to brag, at least take a damn screenshot and not a picture with your phone.
---
In single combat, sure. It's BO3.
---
He's not wrong.
---
I have it. Currently had a purchase of 9g yesterday
---
It’s 20 to learn the skill and 72 to buy the mount, right?
---
I am on Alliance
---
I joined a Pug MC run as 40th member, they were already on the trash.
---
When i saw the 3 boomkins after arriving i thought ok, lets see how it goes.
---
It was a good run tho, cleared all bosses on the first shot, just couldnt handle rag sadly :)
---
All items, unless BoP, are exactly equivalent to their gold worth. If the item is worth a low amount, sure take it because I don't really care. But if an item is worth a lot it's just the equivalent of taking gold from the group. 
---
In a market with a lot of supply, it's all fungible.
---
I was at 20g at 39 then 100 at 40. all you gotta do is stop leveling and fish expensive fish for hours lmao
---
What a little sly!
---
Just get some1 to invite you, then switch chars, have them invite ur alt, then that person leaves the party.
---
I've been playing for a long time and I would say that you should try to go without them for as long as you can really. You do not need macros in the least while leveling, they may become more desirable by max level and by that point you may have a good idea of what macros you may need for your class.
---
I would point you in the right direction now regardless since you did ask, but I do not play rogue so I wouldn't know, but I presume their might be so stealth related macros (auras, modes and stances tend to be the main focus of most macros in classic since the gameplay isn't so much about rotations, and more about utility and choices.)
---
Ok not sure why down voted but you do you lol
---
Yup my main is level 38. Been really enjoying taking it at a leisurely pace. Playing more like an actual RPG than some kind of grind simulator.
---
Thought you were at lvl 40 with that amount of gold. Nice done man, gl getting that next mount!

I spent about 4 hours in the delivery room playing on my laptop a week ago waiting for... things... to get moving!

Just don’t do it, I wouldn’t.
---
Traded 15 pages to this guy, no thanks !!
---
No fucking kidding. If people are this concerned about class balance they should go play retail where it's way more balanced than vanilla. Having stupid rules and stipulations does nothing but muddy the water and incentivize bland gameplay.
---
I bought it for my hunter as a leveling wep for like 3g
---
they don't sell for that much anymore, at least on my server, but still a good option
---
Honesty, yes, I dont understand. I am a casual player. But those issues mean nothing to me if I am stuck in a dead realm. Thankfully I am not, but I know others are. 
---
My literal only point is that I wish people would have more compassion. Advocate for better solutions instead of reminding people it's their own fault. I even see people advocating for blizzard to NOT fix the problem for them because it'll cause the issues that you mentioned. Because they put up with the hour long queues and its not their problem, why should they care?

Thank you for your honesty

As someone with a mage friend, this is how I feel every time I buy water from an innkeeper.

hahaha fuck yeah
---
It's the same as streaming any other game lol people don't need to know they're being streamed if they can do or say it in game to a stranger they can do or say it on stream.
---
Only friends or people you're talking to privately need to know if you're streaming
---
I don't know anyone in the guild I'm in irl. I'm just active and willing to help when I can. I can't speak for your gold or server but generally if you are willing to help others would be willing to help you as well. Good luck out there
---
SS/cleave will only hit two mobs twice, if you have enough charges. I still haven't quite figured out SS/WW mechanics but it seems to expend a charge for each enemy hit, so up to 4, resulting in 8 hits
---
Maybe make your own "competitive wow classic" were you can have your own dry discussion. This reddit is billed as a fan community &amp; should reflect it's fans. If you don't like the fans at large, make a community that doesn't include all of them.
---
I think you should hold for about a week into Dire Maul. The gold earning potential will skyrocket people's income, and the 400g now will be worth 800g next week or so
---
I’m level 33 horde about to start SM, what is my dungeon grind looking like?
---
I read about Gnomeregan, is that included?

Not a fan of questing but dungeoning for levels

Yeah I feel like I remember people asking for Whitemane's thighs. *Well.......*

Here's how: https://youtu.be/4_RFwsDkUM8
---
Also how to solo Rotgrip: https://youtu.be/1VAuHu0pw3g
---
Yes.
---
To be fair, the item is not BoP and it’s sellable and there are no rules established it’s basically free for all. It’s shitty, but we don’t live in a perfect world. It’s rare to see someone give a stranger a chance of getting the 250g flask from him after he won. Sucks but you snooze you lose. (I lost robe pattern 8 times to ppl who whispered me after they got it trying to sell it to me after i kept saying I’m a tailor) also lost balnazar neck to a paladin who wanted his judgements to hit. Why would I care if someone made the mistake of greeding before checking who needs when no rules were established?
---
I'm also mad that I didn't farm karma with incremental updates about my character's progress.
---
Yeah this bloke is bang on. Just sit in dungeons for the rest of your life.

Find urself a rogue and do duo runs. Save some money on not having to blast the door open aswell

ENGINEERING ITEMS
---
All one-time, on-use, non-equippable consumable engineering items are banned, except for Grenades and Engineering Bombs, which are permitted aside from those specified below.  
---
Arcane Bomb is banned.  
---
Flash Bomb is banned.  
---
Goblin Rocket Helmet it is banned.  
---
Gnomish Mind Control Cap is banned.  
---
Arcanite Dragonling is banned.
---
Atrocious rules. Yeah, warlock's the best dueling class, but targeting it with a Healthstone ban is just dumb when you give 2 other classes their absolute best case.
---
Then you have junk like this:
---
&gt; Stealth Detection equippable items are permitted (Stealth class opener rules still apply).
---
Like, what. You're allowed to go ham on countering warlocks and spriests with 200 shadow res but god forbid someone says fuck you rogues.
---
Just by virtue of having engineering enabled though this is going to be a shitshow. It's already stuned enough in favour of certain classes, allowing them to fuck everyone else up with engineering on top of that is silly.
---
Either allow everything or go by arena rules because this middle ground is awful.
---
What addon is that?
---
&gt; If you think he can do zombie farm at that level you've 0 clue what you're 
---
talking about.

see this line:

let me know if you need me to cut my comment up into sentences that are more digestible for you
---
I have yet to not been killed by horde when I’m the only alliance on the boat. One time it looked like they were going to leave me alone then someone 15 levels below started attacking me so the others joined in.
---
Just like in g chat. Ding! Level 22! 
---
Who really cares.
---
 Warlocks are the best duelist in the game, there's nothing to do about it. So what this rules seek is to try and give most classes an oportunity to win in a game that's obviously not balanced in 1v1 situations, not because of bad desing, but because it's impossible to do so. I truly don't understand why so many people complain about them, when the duels are actually fun and competitive between a lot of classes. How can you not give the opener to a Warr when they are the worst class in 1v1. Give em to Rogues too, because it's an integral part of their kit, but ban tea because without pvp trinkets, you can stunlock some classses to death without giving any counterplay. Why so upsted with healthstones being banned when Warlocks can win against any class without them anyways? It will never be a perfect rule-set, but the duels are actually fun, try to enjoy them!
---
That has literally nothing to do with this
---
I'm getting a similar feeling. I run into far more now which simply refuses all communication until it's they benefit from helping each other. Then they're raging mad when I tell them "So it suits you now?".
---
Look mom an oomkin!
---
Yea its from lil timmy the vendor who walks around storm wind. He also sells white kitten. 3-5g horde side ah on Kromcrush
---
It is very easy to downvote and move on. I see this kind of complaint a million times a day all over Reddit. Here I am not taking my own advice. Should have just downvoted this shit and moved on lol.
---
&gt;Why would I care if someone made the mistake of greeding before checking who needs when no rules were established?
---
Theoretically, because you're not a dick.
---
Just because other people are dicks doesn't give you an excuse to also be a dick in the eyes of other people who aren't dicks.
---
Same I gave it one night at 37. In vanilla took me weeks. Three hours one night and showed up right in front of me also at that hill. I was in such shock my friend told me to breath. Gratz
---
18 and 72. Total 90g. I didn't get my mount until 42, which is common. Quests start rewarding more gold after 40, with the peak gold rewards being between 45-55.
---
&gt;im not here to tell people what to do
---
Funny thing is that is exactly what China is doing. To the point of putting people in concentration camps, jail, and trying to take over a city that should have democratic rights all at the point of a gun. That's what this whole thing is about. Limiting peoples freedom.  
---
&gt;if you are the other type of person to bombard others to tell them they should cancel *their* accounts because of the movement, then i get pretty cynical.
---
There is a good chance that if you were in China, you would have your access to Blizzard games restricted in the future. *Because of one interview.* You wouldn't even be able to play. So you're getting mad because someone told you to cancel your account, ironic.  Funny thing is, no one actually told you to cancel your account until you started mocking others. If you don't want to invite criticism on yourself, you probably shouldn't criticize others.  
---
&gt;go do something, go protest, go get petitions signed. theres actual things you can be doing. so all in all, people should stop following every post on every subreddit of every blizzard game and brag about them cancelling their accounts like theyre actually doing something. it doesnt spread awareness when i see someone make every post about china. its actually pushing me further away of doing anything when i see it to be honest.
---
Boycotts are actually a more effective method of influencing public companies than all the ways you mentioned in your quote. Money is the lifeblood of a company. They can't survive without it.   
---
And protesting? This is protesting. 
---
Def - "the expression of disapproval of or objection to something."
---
Is this not the best place next to BlizzCon to protest? Just cause it doesn't look like the way your parents protested doesn't mean it's not effective. The goal of a protest is, ideally, to change public opinion. Is that not what's being attempted here? But really, you are just trying to win the argument and belittle what people are doing. To stop people from making you feel uncomfortable. The truth is, you don't want to be affected by this. You want to play your game and not have to worry about the suffering of others.
---
&gt;it doesnt spread awareness when i see someone make every post about china
---
This makes no sense. More people are aware of the human rights violations going on in China than ever before.   
---
&gt; its actually pushing me further away of doing anything when i see it to be honest.
---
That's really unfortunate. Don't worry about all this though. Stick your head in the sand, go back to your room, and play your video games.
---
That's how capitalism works. If someone is charging 20g and you charge 15g, you get the job but you do the same work for less. They can go 14g if they want to take your business.
---
And this is how Defias slash fiction got started ...
---
It could be worse guy. You could be a pally that forgets to bless, even himself.
---
Well I ran one in classic beta and was in a few tourneys then, and also organized a ton in WOTLK. So a fair bit
---
Soul Link is a ridiculous talent. Just look at the amount of damage it mitigates vs other talents in this game. It's not balanced at all. It might be fair if it were like, 15%.  But 30 is just absurd.
---
This quest has some weird gimmick that you can’t overkill them too much or the legs don’t drop. 
---
It vaguely mentions it in the description in the quest item journal you get. 
---
*The Glassweb spiders of Searing Gorge
---
are made of an incredible
---
crystal-like material. Their legs, if not
---
damaged when they're killed, make for
---
a wonderful conductor in some of my
---
companions' engineering experiments.*
---
*I will need a number of them to test
---
upon. The spiders having eight possible
---
legs themselves should be no problem
---
for a stalwart warrior or practiced
---
mage.*
---
I am the tank bro, and i tank for fun, not for people's gold.

what the fuck, thanks
---
PCs sort of exist, but we break all sorts of rule. The Light is supposed to be agonizingly painful for Forsaken to use or be healed by.
---
But game mechanics let us do it anyway.
---
But you'd still be able to drop one in a town where it'd fight guards to the death?
---
Then you don't have the hidden object mini game of sliding your mouse pointer over the entirety of the ground.

If I recall you backup when see them cast this and your fine. It works like demo shout.

Equip conpare, BIS tracker
---
This is exactly what we need
---
What about perception?
---
Jump on the barrels and then the ledge, you will evade and reset aggro.
---
You have to hear the stealth noise, meaning they are seen.  It’s the same for mobs that stealth, you’ll hear the noise that comes from using stealth on a rogue/cat Druid.  If you don’t play with sound and do world pvp, just treat it as Russian roulette I guess.
---
I love that people downvote and tell you to move on, but spend the time replying to you about it. They’re effectively going against their own advice
---
I agree, it feels like Facebook at times.
---
Storyline is the better (imo) version of Immersion, which makes reading quest text much more interactive.

Leatrix Plus, and Leatrix Maps, are both fantastic - though I mostly use Plus for the easy max camera adjustment.

/u/Sweenyton, I'm getting an error when trying to import the ElvUI profile stating "Error decompressing: Unknown compression method (26)" Do you have any insight into this?
---
Great looking WA by the who. I'm working on getting it up and running, and scaled properly, and will give additional feedback when and where appropriate from my own experience. I hope you continue working on this.
---
I'm late to the topic but I'm glad you actually took the time to research your own claim, find out that you were wrong and admitted it. Yes, it was pretty dire back in 2006 when 75% of the Alliance turned with their keyboards. One story I fondly remember back in the day: a mage in the top PvE guild claimed he was the best mage on the server simply because he had better gear than everyone else and can PoM Pyro 2-shot people. When I dueled him in my tier 0 dungeon gear on my shadow priest, I los'd him easily behind the tree by the entrance on Ironforge; he then claimed that I was 'cheating'.
---
This is no longer true. The majority of classic players are returning for the challenge and are more likely to min-max; this means that they often choose Horde because Horde have better racials. No one chose Human for the lore anymore because the lore is all known. That's why in classic WoW a majority of servers are in fact Horde favoured when back in 2006 they were Alliance favoured. Also, less kids on either side but moreso on Alliance due to boobies.
---
So nowadays, the population competency is more equal. I certainly agree with you as someone who played both sides in WoW 2005-2008, but as an Alliance player in 2019 WoW I was very very surprised by the quality of my PuGs. Never had an attempt outright fail yet, someone either ditches or we agree to stop cus we got what we came for. Back in 2006, I've failed Gnomeregan more times than I can count.
---
Lol even though I am a warlock and I get a free 40 mount I still had over 40g from leveling and I never put a single item on AH. I also gave all my silk to my brother for his tailoring while leveling up tailoring(put no money into it while leveling it. All mats from grinding.)
---
Apparently we’re in the minority for expecting a sub-Reddit for a game to be anything other than fluff and hand holding and high fiving
---
The fact that I got 30+ death threats over the course of two weeks from the same mage as soon as I logged in because I feared his mobs while AoE-farming is a preeetty good sign that reports are basically useless.
---
Nothing ever happened. Seriously, what is worse than death threats in game? For real
---
Level 40 Spriest. Where to level?
---
I know the later STV quests but what else?
---
even then intimidate stun
---
I love taking screenshots of stuff like this and asking my friends to find the herb.
---
Then how did you deal with Rogues standing around waiting for hunter traps to wear off?
---
Because people think that bashing capitalism means you're aligned with a system they don't understand. (ie you're a "commie" or a socialist whatever it means in their head)
---
All I’m saying is you can’t control people and gave my experience. It sucks but I always keep an eye on those things so shit doesn’t happen. Happened in Ras today, a rogue needed on flask and i rolled need. I won and had the grp roll and ignored the rogue’s roll and the priest got the recipe. That’s how I operate idk about others. I don’t care much for gear or gold since thankfully I got more. It’s just a lot of people have the mentality of “ either I win or I win more”. Sucks ass tbh
---
If you read about 5 of this OPs replies it’s easy to see he’s a lying troll. This whole thread is fake.

Thanks for comin

Nice man thanks for sharing
---
I want to give the game a shot, so I made an account with Blizzard and even purchased a subscription. But when I click the "play now" button on the wow classic page, it still brings me to the page prompting me to make a subscription. How do I get to download the client?
---
Drop the quest and redo it. Probably a bug.

Don't mind the baby boar corpses
---
It has good aoe threat, bad itemisation, bad single target threat, large and glaring issues with threat drops, mana issues.
---
So for some dungeons it's pretty good but generally it just isn't worth the effort.
---
My advice is to wait till tbc when they are amazing and until then try other things.
---
Id skip gnomer unless their are quests for horde.
---
Find a good group for SM and spam Graveyard, lib and maybe armory runs if other folks are higher.
---
What class are you?
---
are there any others?
---
I was a vanilla server-first fanatic, and I've been surprised at the quality of paladin tanks this time around. Keep up the good work!
---
In my experience it'll eat a SS charge on an auto attack regardless but not when you're hitting a whirlwind target that isn't in your frontal attack cone.
---
Things do happen but it's automated. After a certain amount of reports action is taken on your account.
---
iLL sAY iT oNcE anD iLl SaY iT agAIn, nO cHaNgEs!!!!
---
Makes sense since low levels are probs ppl levelling alts too. They just want it down as fast as possible at this point compared to when everyone first started
---
Death coil first.
---
What's that even mean
---
They have a changelog from 3.2, where it was changed to 2 minutes. Honest mistake.
---
Come on, Warr loses against almost al classes. If you don't give them the ability to open first, then you will end up with duels where the warrior didn't even touch his oponent
---
First of all being straight is a cultural identity, I don't understand how you can be so ignorant and invalidate straight people because you are insecure about your identity. 
---
Back in the day bullying and making fun of gay people was the norm, nowdays it is the most surefire way to destroy your reputation, lose your job and get kicked out of school, this is how mainstream and protected LGBT has become. 
---
People like you are the reason why there are going to be dozens of Straight Pride Parades in USA next year, you are so out of touch with reality that we need a parade to make fun out of what the modern LGBT movement has become
---
The best part was the bit about doing the survey.
---
if its your first time i would recommend not solely running dungeons. not only do you miss sone amazing quests, but you will also not learn to play your class properly just spamming dungeons.
---
Vanilla wow is not classic wow FYI
---
Because it didn't drop for you, it dropped for the group.
---
warlock will win this ezpz
---
Spiders have 8 legs, you should have 456 legs with 57 kills but you have 0.

Came here for this :)
---
Slow is smooth and smooth is  fast.  I'd rather take an extra 5 whole minutes Losing safe pulls than pull a bunch extra with a rando eye spawn or garg patrol.  1 wipe or near wipe and you've lost any time saving you might have from trying to speed pull.
---
That being said, if youre going for the 45 minute baron or whatever and you know you're going balls out and pulling double packs and stuff, then by all means do it.
---
Maybe they're supported by taxes.
---
There was a chapter in one of the WoW books in which Thrall was having some trouble coming up with funds to pay for a building project in Orgrimmar. I'm guessing he's the one footing the bill.
---
Are you forreal
---
What name did you want, and what did you get
---
The first time around it didn’t die because it had an expansion.. it wasn’t given enough time to run its course.
---
I don’t get how it’s so hard for people to understand that a game will die if there is no new content.
---
You’ll say why didnt unofficial servers die then?? 
---
Thats because amount of players unofficial servers had is not close to what blizzard has.
---
If you have a 2nd account or a friend you can change the name.
---
Devilsaur is better unless you cop T1 gloves in addition to the t2 legs.
---
Imagine if every lvl 40 who learned riding and bought a mount was excited and posted a picture.
---
Thinking the same lol wtf
---
That's your opinion. I personally prefer loot council over other systems based on my own experience.
---
Warrior
---
Go in your server discord and see if you can get 10 or so people to report your name.  I believe the automated name flagging system still works in Classic.
---
This is definitely the greatest post on this subreddit. Bravo. Proper laughed watching it, especially when the clap was in perfect timing with the music.
---
Wouldn't be classic WoW without a buggy Vanish.
---
Light Leather, Wicked Claw, Large Fang, Fused Wiring, all good items to have on a "NEVER VENDOR THESE" list
---
Love Thousand Needles, it was one of my goals in classic, to reach it

I'd get used to macros now so you can get used to the good ones and make things easier. This thread had some good ones.

or good rng/being the only hunter. our token druid has 7/8 and epic wep. no competition = easy loot.

CRYING IN MY SKIN

wow is one of those games that due to people leveling alts you can join in at any time, PVP servers may be a bit harder towards the end of your leveling phase is you are behind but that's about it.

Most common age for vanilla players was 21 back in the days. I was amazed to hear that since people were so mean back then, and now. It’s the internet and I guess it doesn’t just change.
---
Four of our hunters have 5/8 tier sets and our rogues are decked out too. Meanwhile barely any mage or priest items hace dropped
---
&gt; too rich
---
Doubtful if he doesn't have an epic mount yet
---
Well... Strength, defence and armour are useless for your range damage. Thought we were talking BiS? If you want to talk viable, or even pvp that's a different conversation isn't it?
---
 Dal'rends definitely aren't shitty, but they're also probably alot harder to get. But for range damage...peacemaker is bis...which you can see clearly from the stats comparing the weapons.
---
They aren’t better than Peacemaker. They’re strictly worse, until you can get double +15 agi.
---
Yea, corruption is the only dot I use, but you must be joining bad groups if you need anything else. Things die too quick for it to be worth the mana.
---
Edgy shoehorn of a hot button topic. Nice work kid.
---
Perception does work on stealth, but tbh it’s not that noticeable. If the rogue is sneaking around you, it can help. If he’s coming right for you, the extra detection is normally not enough for you to do anything about it, you’ll just get a half second heads up before the ambush/stun
---
We're all dudes
---
I haven’t seen this before.
---
Yes or get that addon and a decent sized guild and ask (?item name) and you will get automated whispers from guildies within there aucc addons and give you there prices too.
---
Theyre not pre bis, the polearm from strath is better.
---
I just worry that given/emphasising fist weapons will make them into less shaman and more native american monk.
---
Just luck. Easily doable in 5 hours a week of playing with good rng.
---
They also do it to show they are Gnome engineering superior, and gnome engineering build the free train between SW and IF
---
It varies from server to server. Your best bet is to look at the market price average. Auctioneer is a must, if you dont have it. With that in mind, go look if there are any other listings on the AH. If there aren't, you're safe to go with the market price. If there are, you're going to have to follow the status quo and price it around the other postings or undercut by a small margin. Nobody can give you a definite answer on anything price related when it comes to the AH.
---
Are you sure arcanite bars didnt just spike because of that sulfuras? 50 bars is no joke.
---
Which is what's important, it's best in slot right now. 
---
It doesn't matter at all if someone else becomes that later, get it later and give it to the people that it's actually best for.
---
Is 60 more than 56? The answer might surprise you!
---
Its bis for melee not for hunters... Meanwhile dal rends are worse than the stratholme polearm for hunters because no 15 agi enchant yet
---
Yikes, you just come off as salty.
---
Super easy, barely an inconvenience
---
Since when was attacking a numerically superior group considered a “gank”?
---
Yes, if someone is that profession and doesn’t have the recipe it’s a need, and that trumps selling it/greed.  What if it sold for 200, or 100 or 50 or 5?  What’s the cutoff?  If a piece of BOE gear dropped that’s an upgrade that will be used, that should be needed as well, which trumps greed/gold.  It’s a slippery slope.
---
That's exactly what rare recipes are for.
---
If you PvP at all, then you understand the value of having a 2hander over dual wielding as a hunter. Raptor Strike easily reaches 40% crit, and that’ll sting coming from a 2hander.
---
Ha. Love it
---
Thanks for the free enchant 🥳😋😂
---
It's really not that difficult. Warlocks, hunters, and even priests can safely solo her.
---
Warlocks, Hunters and Priests usually solo Maraudon for gold, including Princess, so a lot of the times they sell runs for others and killing princess for them, and then they get paid when the ring drops. Just an additional split of cash while already doing what you meant to do.
---
Oh yes that sweet 3% drop rate is all kinds of fun
---
It's because the majority of players are not 60 and are trying to avoid playing alts so that they can hit 60.  There are lots of people at 60 who have already rolled alts, and in another month, the majority of classic players will have hit 60 and many MANY of them will roll alts.  You just have to wait for the next boom.
---
Mechanically it's vanilla
---
I mean it wasn’t like you made an instantaneous decision...i’m sure it took you at least a week to reach 60...during that time what was going through your head? Like when you hit level 40 and your friends were on another server what was your thought process like?  
---
Why don’t you level another toon on their server
---
Those are part dragon
---
Okay so.. any one els notice this guy is guild-less??
---
Yeah this is all rng... our raid group only had 2 hunters for a while. Our Druid is getting decked the hell out currently not having to roll against anyone. Still impressive for sure
---
I mean cartelization is a great strategy for members of the cartel.

---
There's also laws against price dumping.
---
I'm aware I can do duo runs I just want to know if it's feasible to do them solo with enough gear or tryhardery.
---
That's awful. I'm sorry.
---
Aren’t you gonna make an alt anyway? Might as well begin on an alt there now and be patient. Doesn’t take that long to get to 60 but I get that it’s kinda boring if you wanna gear up. Maybe your mates wants an alt as well.
---
All Im saying is, there is no reason not to be a boomkin in the present.
---
It’s because you zone as a model then get places on the horse immediately. When you were a model you were no longer stuck to the boat.
---
 Just FYI if you jump off your mount and stick to the side you’ll be fine
---
I believe people have been using fire resist potions instead of a fire resist set.
---
but dat fire res tho
---
“2 epic weapons” while you aren’t wrong it’s the same damn quest my guy...
---
Man I did over 100 and luckily got it on my first roll. Chain took longer but by then I knew to never allow competition in my group. Brutal
---
Goblin Zepellins were a unit you could buy in WC3 to transport your troops more easily  across the map.
---
Lmao perfect timing.
---
for always
---
Yes this is more about paranoia and not about the model blocking.   Tbh I'd rather have a succubus or a voidwalker out against a rogue.
---
Where can I ride a zeppelin as an alliance?
---
You wouldn't be 60 playing 5 hours a week homie
---
I'd rather they start removing all art posts before they do anything else. Ban all battlestation posts as well.
---
Pretty sure small veins can also drop rare gems but at lower rates and no Arcane crystals.
---
Thistle tea is beyond broken this early in the game
---
I needed this, thank you
---
Yea so far I've not been able to kill her at all.  She one shots me every run... I read online it's really rare she does that attack.  In which case I'm extremely fucking unlucky.
---
No as that was not a feature that was in classic. Your decisions have consequences.
---
Lmao dude go outside.
---
LA DI DA, is called Cartelization, welcome to real life economics, son.
---
Now on a more serious note the muting system is a joke no matter what you do or say if you get enough reports you get muted no matter what, fucking blizzard idiots.

Healbot

Locks are notoriously vulnerable to rosey cheeks.
---
emblem of heroism, and there was only shoulder and chest and weapons. but most people had mountains of emblems because they did dungeons daily, to get the RDF daily bonuses
---
there also were pvp alternatives to each item, purchased with stone keeper shards instead
---
I honestly don't gank a lot of Warlocks.
---
If they resist one single stun or CC from me and I miss my interrupt for any reason and they get a fear on me, I'm dead plain and simple.
---
It's not worth it. I'm at an 86% win rate when it comes to world PVP(1v1ing players I come across) and I don't plan to let that # drop! :P
---
Your working yourself up over nothing.
---
Are we supposed to care?
---
Why do people post stuff like this, validating their own poor decisions or something? Like ya, we get it, vanilla wow is too hard for you. Maybe go try fortnite
---
Segregating into insular groups is not creating a diverse society.
---
Idk, it's exhausting if it's everywhere I go. I like having spaces where I can take a mental break from it. There's nothing wrong with wanting an experience that's carefree.

As a warrior: pls
---
Ok so monoculturalism...creates diverse societies??
---
Grats on your mount dude! Keep it up you'll get 60 in no time little bud!
---
Would you mind posting the talents?
---
So I had 90g at 40 without too much effort...  I sold some spiders silk in Ah for like 5 g fished some lobsters in desolace for like 12 g (5 for 55s repeatable quest) all the rest comes from hitting now and take what they leave...  Just don't ignore all those mobs that are niche part of a quest. Most money comes from killing actual mobs..
---
Only thing I have against this is how it would effect MS&gt;OS
---
420
---
Yeah, Blizzard has always sucked at everything that isn't directly related to making games. And they're falling off on even that these days. When was the last time they produced a new, truly good game? Or even an expansion to an existing game?  
---
All they do is make slot machines now.
---
Really depends on your class. The regular white devilsaurs I can solo as a rogue, but the tyrants I have to burn consumables to kill. The ironhide ones I have yet to get to fight 1v1
---
I can't believe this is a thing, fucking soy nerds.
---
Holy free time batman
---
Yeah but we are talking boes here. How come he needs the 50g recipe more than anyone else. You save 50g for not having to buy it from ah, or your groupmates gain 50g for putting it in ah. The hypocrisity here is the person with the profession saying he needs the gold more than someone else
---
Carebearz of &lt;Get Gnomed&gt; on Fairbanks

Then healing focus is pretty necessary for pvp.

Underrated comment.

Also a warrior: pls

Holy shit when in doubt double down ... Fucking hunters man.

Mad.

people have to keep doing it so they dont get depressed over the slog that is leveling in classic.

A Shaman pls

I need to start studying Japanese.  What do you recommend for a new learner? I went to japan this year and fell in love with everything.  I wanted to learn more for when I go back throughout my life
---
Its great, very efficient leveling and survivability. Can heal dungeons too.
---
Everyone who's not an idiot knows what DM means in 3 days but there might be some idiots trying to manipulate market pre patch for the lulz.
---
hey, i see that guild on BB all the time! i heard people yelling about a dragon when i made a paladin alt earlier... that'll definitely put a damper on dying in some kobold-infested mines :^ )
---
They get paid by the Horde/Alliance for their continued use.
---
I actually dont know much about rogue, but dont you have prep to just reset all your cooldowns?
---
You can give warrior a free charge, 10 second doing nothing handicap and he will still lose so not much of a problem.
---
I was asking for her to be blasting some major toots
---
Is survival worth it at all in classic i wonder? Or is marksman just too good
---
Stickied mod post violates 6 out of the 7 subreddit rules. Great job lads.

if you ignore like half of it yea man totally

This same thing is posted daily

Better that than ally scum 😾
---
People screaming in Reddit comments doesn't actually represent the overall playerbase. Some people just want to play the game they love in peace because heckling people to boycott doesn't so anything
---
Can you toggle between PvE/PvP?
---
When I first started, I rolled Druid and insisted on being balance because I liked the moon 
---
kin form. That lasted until around 40, when I respecced resto to heal..... and continued to level that way. I didn’t even know the game wasn’t supposed to be that hard. :|
---
Find somewhere to take classes.  You need to be interacting with someone to effectively learn a language.  You could pretty easily teach yourself to read (and to a lesser degree write) with books and the internet on your own, but you'll need someone to actually speak with to learn to communicate in Japanese.
---
I think it's good to have dreams!
---
This may surprise you, but retail honestly isnt that much more balanced.
---
No it’s just PvE

Just did my first Maraudon run. The cave before you get to the instances is absolutely crazy. It seems impossible to navigate.

Warrior definitely not. I think shaman/paladin is what u meant.

So I understand mages aren’t welcome to complain around here. I leveled without AOE and let me tell you it can be so hair ripping sitting there drinking water 10 levels below you for a minute in between each fight:(

I’m very thankful I don’t have to farm Chain. That would be maddening!

It's because Chester is dead :(....

It costs something to level the skill, but the enchants (with mats) cost nothing additional.That initial cost of leveling quickly goes to 0 as you divide out the number of times you've used it.

Mana gem is crap compared to a healthstone. Locks in 1v1 are OP.

I know, I play one. But they're very similar spells I mean, that's all.

I'm about 86% sure that there are underground teleport bots that mine every node now.
---
Because I had exactly the same experience. Mining used to be just fine, I'd go out at like 4-5AM server and make decent gold, eventually get an arcane crystal.
---
About 2 weeks ago I just stopped seeing more than 1 node an hour (max). I didn't see any other 60s on the route either no matter how many times I went around. And it was the same route that worked in the past.
---
Doesn't matter when you check it they're always gone. Only reason to be a miner now is on your DM character.
---
That is completely incorrect. Stealth in Classic is very different than the private servers. I've tested with paranoia, goggles, and elixir, and stealth can be seen from 30 yards away, even with MoD

Who cares, its not a private game. But in my opinion you should let people know you are streaming if the stream includes anything from outside the game, like discord voice or any other voice program.

Yes just dungeons. Raid lockouts reset on Tuesdays

Shitty art

warlocks malding
---
a while back around level 30 or so, i see 2 alliance warriors running towards me. one is a skull, the other is just a level above me. im a warlock.  
---
the one my level charges at me and the skull starts dancing around us to watch the fight. i do my usual fear and dot routine and get the low level down to half health when the skull realizes his buddy doesnt stand a chance at this point and hasnt even gotten a hit off yet, so he comes after me with a charge and chunks me like 1/2 of my health in the first swing. i was waiting for this and instantly use my succubus to seduce him, because for some reason it doesnt seem to get resisted by higher levels like my normal spells.  i was able to finish off the low level, wave at the CC"ed warrior, and ran off before the seduce wore off and went on my merry way only taking that one hit. most satisfying moment i had so far.

Except they are abusing a broken system to enforce it.

I can just tell you’re absolute terrible at the game lmao.
---
I would recommend you join the fullest RP server and not a rp-pvp server.  I do think a majority of players expect the RP to just come to them so to speak. In reality you will want to go in the chat and be vocal about wanting to participate.  Join a guild that does events if you can find one.  If the guild only has a small number of players and not many people are online then don’t feel bad just leave the guild and look for one that is active. 
---
Organizers of events are a bit hard to find but I believe you will be able to if you are serious about wanting to rp. If you organize an event yourself then even better. If you put everything together you will be able to find people that want to join.  Most people just don’t want to do the work of organizing and leading an event.

Under the "Evidence" Section: feel free to click any of the links that look like little numbers. This brings you to the bottom of the page where there is a citation, a source of information.
---
Maybe you should try listening to what is going on around you. 
---
If it smells like shit everywhere you go, it isn't because the world smells like shit, its probably because you have shit on your shoe.
---
Say you post a stack of 20 ore and someone else posts 20 stacks of 1
---
Someone wants 14 ore and would have no use for any more than that.
---
They pass over your stack because they need no use and instead set to work buying out 14 stacks of 1 from the other guy.
---
However the value of posting at a given stack size goes down the more stacks are posted at that size.
---
If there's 100 stacks of 1 and 50 stacks of 5 but 0 stacks at 10 or 20 then 10&amp;20 will be where you should post them.
---
As a general rule it's best to post a variety of stack sizes.
---
Like if you have 40 to sell, you might as well do:
---
- 5 stacks of 1
---
- 2 stacks of 3
---
- 1 stack of 4
---
- 3 stacks of 5
---
- 1 stacks of 10
---
Rather than just posting your entire stock in stacks of 1 or 20 or whatever as it'll make it convenient for the widest range of buyers.
---
Don't put all your eggs in one basket and all that.
---
Also keep in mind how many of that item are used in its most popular recipe---If it takes 3 herbs to make a potion then you'll get the best value out of posting in multiples of 3.
---
How do priests solo Princess exactly?
---
Why did you pick +5 resistances on your cloak instead of +3 agility?
---
Well come on, give us the goods at least. What's the name, we want to hear how bad it is!
---
No but that doesn't mean its okay.
---
Why.. do you play?
---
No I just mean that classes that wield 2handed weapons get 2ap from 1 str. Rogues do not.
---
No.

it's up to blizzard if this is "against the tos".  So many people do it they can't start banning people without first telling people to stop.
---
This is some grinch bah humbug shit. It’s a huge accomplishment to hit 60 man. Let the people have their damn moment
---
I mean - if someone actually is going to use it they should roll need... otherwise it's greed.
---
you seem upset
---
You had to edit the "scum" into "filth" I bet now you are feeling so tough. Now you can go and gank low levels with your edgy undead rog.
---
Worse than RNG...it's RNG that wasn't seeded because the programmers are indeed that retarded.
---
shit... ive got a 60 and two alts thats higher lvl than your main. just quit your job man.  
---
Real talk though, i have 3 friends with jobs and wifes and they have been 60 for weeks. You are simply just spending your time really badly for leveling speed.
---
Ahhh, I see you bought one of those Skyrim horses for a mount.
---
I wanted to say something, but every time I say something rude, I either get banned or downvoted like EA.
---
Okay so he took one week off work and got lvl 60 within that?
---
Ding! Level 37 guys!?!? Came here for emotional support.🤪
---
Don't worry, 2H still has heavy focus. I just made 2H Skills and Parry into baseline abilities learnable at level 10.
---
Same.
---
Reminder: this was all developed in and around 2003 by a pretty small company. You can't blame them for not being at the cutting edge of game design or programming back then lmao

“Had”? Was it fixed?

She still got some thicc booty meat even when she ded

"Just hit level 10 and killed Hogger, absolutely in love with classic!!"

I'd be hard pressed to call Reddit social media. It's an internet discussion forum, not a place to post your pictures and talk about your day
---
Nah this just making classic not classic sorry. Easy mode.
---
horde be good people
---
They're only useless if you're a min/max playstyle raider. MC is not that hard, and they're fun in pvp. They're just probably the worst ranged caster. But people still enjoy playing it sometimes as it's a unique playstyle.
---
🤔
---
Hes not wrong.. if a mob is facing you and you kidney shot sometimes they spin around 180 and face their back to you.. not all the time but it happens often
---
Cool, does it show BiS and optional? Absolute bis is sometimes just insane luck and not worth going for. Also will it update in phase 2?
---
Leo's metal covers are great! Hollaback Girl has to be the best though
---
Boomkin was my first max level (hit max right as bc dropped and quit before next expan). Boomkin was so bad it made me sad.
---
You got a weird clearcasting skill if you melee and armor bonus but then you also have a machine gun wrath so it feels like your kit is fighting against itself.
---
I almost nevet used Boomkin because I found being able to constantly keep hots on mt was more helpful to group survivability then the 3% crit. Esp if your group was melee heavy.
---
Fire resist isn't really used as a mage. Use fire shield and fire pots instead. Ony the relevant fire dmg is breath (very avoidable except when she lands going into p3), p2 fireballs which hit for 1500ish which your shield would mitigate most of, and deep breath which will kill your ass regardless after 2ish seconds.
---
I can't agree enough - we either need a megathread or limit all of these posts to one day out of the week (like "show oof Saturday" or something)
---
Relax lol, I was 11 days played before hitting 60. I didn’t rush everything and did a lot of quests that would be considered “inefficient”.
---
I had an spriest in a BRD group the other way. It's nice that not everyone is mindlessly conforming to some idea of a meta.
---
The Survival tree is literally based around survival, not damage. It's right in the name. It's a good tree for PvP.
---
:/ I just thought it was cute man and I already commented on the phone pic
---
It baffles me how people get "stuck" and can't level up, how is that even a thing? If you run out of quests just switch zones, there is always a level overlap between zones. If you go and do just a couple of quests in each of Blasted Lands, Un'goro, Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Felwood, Winterspring, Silithus, WPL and EPL you will ding all the way from 50 to 60. You also have your important attunement quest chains to do here and you can throw an occasional dungeon run and/or grind for some gold. It's simple AF...
---
Also get total rp 3 mod. The ones who have it, I'll know I'll have a better time roleplaying with.
---
With cyclone and your biggest hitting dd (star fall?) I was able to chain stun people from 100-0
---
Each their own.  Frostbolt spam = gorge my own eyes out....

Programming was around a long time before 2003, and Blizzard certainly was at the cutting edge of game design when original Wow came out.

The poster above you  is just a dipshit and pulls random information out of his ass he claims to be factual.
---
*laughs in Orc 25% of the time*

And instantly get yeeted away

I've heard this same tired argument so many times and it's still bullshit. There are random drops for all classes and crafting professions. Part of running a dungeon is the fun of working as a team and random rewards you get a long the way. Sometimes it's your day and you get a weapon upgrade or a recipe you can use. Sometimes is somebody else's. And it's a fun part of the game and character progression and enjoyment that you're robbing from people if you're saying,  "no, that's not your recipe, that's my chance at gold and go buy it if you want it so bad," that's what the greed button is there for champ. Grinding and farming for gold isn't the same as getting drops for everyone, if that's how you want to gear up than by all means. And to say "you're better off selling anyway" BoE drops, guess what not everyone plays the same as you. I just equipped a think lvl 29 item I could've sold in phase 3 on my 36 druid last night because it was an upgrade. 
---
  
---
So with all due respect, that's greedy bullshit that abstracts and equates upgrade value with AH value which is different than intrinsic value of experience in a dungeon. You're a ninja.
---
Technically its a time skip
---
Yes this.  Shadowbolt spam is just as bad as frostbolt spam.
---
Same here. Got to 50 as balance then switched to feral and was like what was I doing with my life
---
thats what the gnomes want you to believe
---
If it was literally not seeded there would be addons telling you exactly what was going to drop. The fact we don't exactly predict drops means there's certainly something random about it.
---
Dammit, I needed to see this post like 7 hours ago. The same thing happened to me, on the same boss.
---
respek
---
There’s always something to grind. It’s pretty addictive finding new spots that yield good gph or eph.
---
On retail my dk has like 65 ish binds (tons of arena 123 macros).
---
No naga, no macro buttons. Just a standard 2button gaming mouse and a keyboard. 
---
Never had a problem utilizing anything in a heated arena match, shouldnt be a problem having binds for everything in classic since there's no arena123 or focus macros / targetting macros needed.
---
It's easily soloable my mages. I grinded the frozen wrath cuffs with my mage in 40 attempts.
---
I roll on healing gear on Druid if I dungeon as a Druid. I roll on leather when I play as a tank in the run. I don’t roll on both in any single run
---
Yea exactly! It’s always “where do I go now?”
---
And the answer is right there on there map... shows u every zone in your level range. And no you can’t just stay at one zone effectively! 
---
My sweet spot to do dungeons is in between zones or at even levels when I’m going to major cities to upgrade abilities.
---
This must be the amazing classic community I've been told about, lol.
---
5 hunters in my core raid group. Sucks as a hunter but it could be worse.

You mad man, don’t bring your crazy ideas to this sub! Just follow my lead.

Bring your camera down to be level with the ground then sweep your mouse across the grass that way makes it a lot easier.

That should say enough
---
Are Shadow reflectors a thing?
---
Yea for me this solo stuff is so fun and makes me feel rich when I got a good tempo going.
---
Weapon swing timer. Not super important for a mage or healer but it's so huge for optimising pve combat for every other class.
---
By the looks of that list they stopped adding servers as warcrafts explosive growth stopped and began to decline.  Right now we're not in an explosive growth period, the playerbase probably isn't going to grow much and most likely will be on the decline.  #nochanges would be top follow the pattern after 09 in that list... no new servers... or very few at best.  Making a comparison to a point where 12 million people were playing concurrently pretty much isn't going to work here.  Try again.  I also enjoy the new server rush but the playerbase does not exist to do that and keep other servers healthy.
---
No, you can’t have both professions be blacksmith.
---
As I was typing that I honestly had the thought that it could def be an addon but that’s an easy fix I guess. Ty for confirmation
---
For a toon that I just want to dungeon on would tailoring and enchanting be best as I can get all my supplies for those in the dungeons?
---
more like rip mineral prices when DM comes out in 3 days and people are getting those sweet sweet guaranteed rich veins from solo runs
---
Do you play on Bigglesworth by chance? Because I'm guilty of making this rumor when people ask me why the guards in Gadgetzan don't attack me when I gank right out in the open there.
---
It's not because I'm exalted, but because I'm level 60. The aggro range on guards is just rather small and there are many spots that won't spawn additional guards - just watch the patrolling guards and you can kill anyone in the town except Hunters and Warlocks with their pets on Defensive.
---
Stv was a shit show. Salt flying everywhere, but this guy was the light in the dark.
---
I wish I picked a PvE server. 
---
I always romanticize the idea of PvP servers in my head. When in reality it mostly involves getting 1 shot when getting off flight paths, getting ganked while questing, and getting 1-shot by random skulls.
---
Not all pots are healing ones. I think that some of the more utility potions that aren’t the standard healing / mana / spell/attack power buffs should be allowed if your an alchemist them. It’s part of being a alchemist being able to pull out a useful potion when needed
---
&gt;druids are a meme class.  
---
Fucking lol Druids are so good at aoe tanking though, I'm a mage and I start salivating when my group's tank is a Druid.
---
I legitimately don't think I have seen a moonkin yet.
---
I tried this at launch and it said you can't recover a character if the name is already taken.
---
I'm not forcing him to do anything. I'm offering a counter viewpoint to disagree with his assertion. AH gold value is not the same as dungeon drop enjoyment and progression value. There are loads of people here saying 'BuT AcTuAlLY My LoGiCZ everything is just gold." I'm calling it ninja and voicing my opinion.
---
I’d say brd especially if you can find some good dps to make it go by that much smoother.
---
I love it. Been bonding with friends from high school again. Playing Mage which is so much fun to play, and an alt druid when I feel like healing, tanking, or stealthing. So between those two classes I've got all the playstyles covered. I've even considered a Prot Warrior alt just for a pure tanking / blacksmith experience which I've never done. I love meeting people along the way and questing with them and sharing experiences. My friends and I hop on discord and just have a good time chatting. Classic is definitely my most favorite multiplayer game of all time and I'm excited they brought it back. I just hope they keep it this way, I don't even want TBC expansion.
---
Ony is on a 5 day lockout reset

Probably just a coincidence, my voidwalker is called assheel in dutch. Good stuff.
---
Crawling? :P
---
the set is 22
---
This isn't Pokemon, you don't need to collect every pattern
---
Negative. He’s right.
---
Looked it up on the classic DB and youre right. Only the cat. Played a Pserver that 100% had him vendoring the gun out. My bad!
---
It does a ton of /who commands with specific checks (/who 60 r-undead c-mage, etc) to get a list of every character online when you run it. With a recent update to WoW though, they broke the /who functionality from being automatically run by an addon. The mod still works but requires you to manually push a "Manual Who" button every 5 seconds through all the queries, which greatly hinders its usefulness.  
---
Also, it only gets data for the faction you are currently playing. In order to get accurate measurements for a faction balance, you would need to run the census separately for each. Which requires it to be a new server for you (so you can make the characters and then delete to get on the other faction and run the census), or you to have a friend on the other faction who will run it for you, ideally at the same time frame (since it only checks people online when the queries are run.)
---
"This was Blizzard's response" translates to finger pointing in what language?
---
I played hunter in original vanilla. Gear definitely helps. Use scatter to interrupt a cast. Use FD to interrupt a cast. Don't let your pet get frost nova'ed with you. Use viper sting before you get CC'ed. Use skull of impending doom before you get CC'ed. Wear reflectors. If you can, try to keep them at distance.
---
Once you get some of your tier gear, you will get some resists and things get a bit easier. You'll start raptor strike critting them hard when they get in your grill. Until then, stay on your toes. You might need consumes to win. GL mate.
---
I think people are just blinded by nostalgia and played heavily with a group of friends.
---
Negative. There is an entirely separate roll that occurs in the event of a tie.

Please actually understand your class's itemization before commenting on it. Thank you.

Yes it was, idiot. "YOUR DECISIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES" lmao
---
I've only seen warlocks do it but I am 100% sure there are guides for it on youtube.
---
Tank just isnt fun or interesting to play in classic.
---
Hey brother, 
---
I'm very good at accents. Never voice acted in my life, but would be happy to giver a go! DM if ya wanna collab!
---
Bro just pay 15g for a warlock to get it for you
---
No idea how they do it, I've only seen locks but I have been told hunters can do it.
---
There are always going to be liars, you can’t change that, but you also can’t let that change you from doing the right thing.  Otherwise you can just mental gymnastics your way into looting everything.
---
Except that the format of sorting everything by upvotes rather than chronological order, the tumbnail view of posts, and the set up of karma and gold all make reddit way more oriented towards sharing media and angry circlejerks than facilitating discussion or building a community.
---
Just walk at that point
---
Resorting to name-calling is one hell of a way to offer a counterpoint
---
So I’m currently on the realm bigglesworth (US West) but I live on the east coast. I normally get pretty bad lag around the same time every day and it makes questing pretty unbearable. I can still free transfer but the only US East server is Earthfury. My question is, is the fact that I’m on a west server part of my lag issue? And if I should transfer, hows the population on Eartfury? Would suck to go from a high pop like bigglesworth to server with less activity.
---
While it’s funny, if its intentional, is it an error?
---
I genuinely wish I could bring myself to not give a shit and keep playing. I was having a great time. I'm sorry that you feel that it's stupid.
---
I see that he pointed at the auctioneer, but how did you figure out what item he was trying to give you? Maybe this is a stupid question, but I wouldn't have any clue what to look for. Nice wholesome exchange though for sure. :)
---
[just leaving this here](https://youtu.be/x5W6XK6evyQ)
---
Because they frequently do.
---
Why would they ever do it that way.
---
Nope, heard it from some other place! Seems reasonable though, but this rumor pops up here and there so would be nice to get some final confirmation if it's true or not haha.
---
Only tanks use fire resist nowadays
---
As if 1v1 balance was any better in TBC, or WotLK for that matter. I've seen resto druids literally stand still in tree form,  spamming heals, and killing rogues via thorns. I've seen resto shamans do much the same with searing totem + earth shield. And then 1 or 2 patches later the rogue would blow them up in the opening stunlock because mutiliate all of a sudden now does a million damage and applies endless undispellable poisons. And as bad as Mage vs SL warlock is in vanilla, in TBC it was even worse.
---
1v1 balance has never been a thing that existed in any patch.
---
How expensive are these? Maybe I can join that gnome only guild now!
---
If you become a successful enchanter with desirable plans on your server and aren’t a dick over charging, you’ll make plenty of money as it is. Just being a cool person yourself will rack you in those random huge tips. No need for greed.
---
I got my carrot on a stick today 😂
---
no no, for it to be realistic the hunter has to go pull 3 level appropriate mobs, then i cheap shot and murder him.
---
Hunters fall off hard in later tiers. Most top end guilds will run with one or two in raid max
---
Hunters have 41m range while blink has 20m + nova 10m = 30m. That still leaves 11m of kiting room.
---
Spaces between ellipses are pretty common in English among lawyers. Given that that's likely who wrote this thing, it's not surprising that they would be there.
---
No I’m not, and yeah it’s generally around that time. Could be my internet or laptop since it’s a little old, but I’ve never had any problems on other games so I wasn’t sure if that was it.
---
What's the add on for the health bars as globes like Diablo 3?
---
What's the hit cap against level 60 targets with weapon specialization? For example, bows at 305?
---
Feral is always bad in pvp.  You'll only beat shitters

Oh my God, thank you. Feels great to know I'm not alone.

Classic is challenging, it feels rewarding to accomplish so many things, I get it. But Jesus if I have to see another screenshot of someone who dinged 40 or some dude who convinced their gf to try out wow I might kill myself.

Dose anyone else hate when you get 8 mages in a row that will give you 4 stacks then there’s  that one mage that will give u 17 every time you ask through out the whole dungeon.. maybe hate is to strong of a word cause I can’t complain that much about free water tbh.
---
It's alright, keep being wrong about the order of aoe spam, I won't stop you.

Why are names blocked out? Did they use their real names?

Is there any items that drop combat so you can drink?

When will Prayer of Shadow Protection be released or is it currently in-game?
---
I think if we're in a dungeon with a high value BoE like from the Pyromancers in LBRS, we'd set the rules before hand.  I can tout the logic of a specific loot rule all day but it doesn't matter if no one agrees to it.  That's the ultimate decider.
---
You're free to play your way but it's not *logical*.  But we're here to play a game, nothing we do is really *logical* and the experience is king.  It's fun to have someone who is really looking for a specific pattern to get it and help them out.
---
Then this subreddit isn't for you. Everyone's having a good time, let's enjoy it.
---
Hmm, well, for what it’s worth I’d say don’t do the server switch and if you ever experience some lag again, pop onto the nearby server on a new character and see if you still experience it. After people get off of work, they all get onto the internet, and your local networking hardware could be getting overloaded (“bandwidth exhaust”). Apartment complexes tend to have this issue all the time. Houses are usually a bit better about it. Fiber tends to not have the issue. Cable, DSL, etc tend to have it. It’s possible that WoW uses more upload than other games (a typical cause of lag nowadays, since upload was uncommon when most networks were originally built, and internet connections are typically asymmetrical)
---
Even before social media people wrote shit down though?
---
maybe hes after dat ass
---
This change would literally break so much.  The inability to instantly or cheaply switch specs is a core component of vanilla wow
---
Anyone who says druids are bad a pvp are dumb. They're one of the hardest classes to kill when played correctly.
---
One of the 6 that ganked me today was a gold seller. Right after he tried to sell me gold. That was a new experience.
---
okay, but like bro. I just hit 30 on my rogue :)
---
dont you need 2 drops for them ?
---
Vanilla is not made by blizzard. They scripted everything from the ground up
---
Stop rolling on all the cloth!
---
You mean gnome mage I'm guessing, dwarves can't roll mage.
---
Same with the bracers from incendius
---
That's literally what you just did
---
As a SP I can litterally destroy any hunter that is close enough for me to land Mind blast + Mind flay.
---
The best way for them to get me, is to run away from me, burning my mana and getting in a frontal engage when I am 30%mana or less.
---
The beastmaster hunts are a little bit tougher for me as they can immune their pet to my fear  and stun me.
---
Bow and weapon one quest quiver the other quest
---
I haven't seen one in the wild yet!
---
I don't like my name, can I have a name change too
---
Gah and then theres me who plays like 5 to 6 hours a day and im not even 60 yet
---
Ofc ofc
---
Baby, with me you only need 25 seconds because I'm so intense.
---
Best one yet.
---
There’s a macro you can spam click and it won’t cancel your wand.

That sounds fun

Frost bolt spamming is only for raiding, so much utility and diversity in world PvP and leveling like the post is asking about

Isn't he missing on hit chance with this setup?

You can still ride them, just try not to get killed by all the horde.

What kind of numbers are you putting up without MCP?

I feel like I hang with our rogs/wars just fine on single targets, but maybe our rogs/wars just suck.

The vanilla-wow site refers to things like Kronos or Nostalrius, these were not made by blizzard, they scripted everything from the ground up
---
Try reading

&gt;It's such an insignificant cost that it's 100% irrelevant to your "pro tips

Or get your handler to do it since you're profoundly mentally disabled, you fucking retard.
---
Then 6/8 anything and 2 piece t2 isnt hard for any class. Its not about it being hard anyways I mean ive had this shit since week 4 or 5, including visk + brutality but its more rng and luck than anything.
---
As you get more geared survival becomes a lot better than marks. The increased agi/crit and survivability makes you a serious threat.
---
There isn't one.
---
ah okay, so Kronos and Nostalrius were wrong with their NS CD then
---
Thats a retail thing, since legion?
---
Said nobody that has ever leveled their professions to max level
---
They did, it has +healing on it bwahahaha
---
Horde/alliance cooperation for quest mobs makes my cold heart melt a little
---
Play that fungi music white boy
---
Slightly biased as im a bear myself, but I feel most warriors rather dps and opt to tank in pugs to find a party quicker, while most druid tanks actually chose to tank instead of heal/dps(which are way more common druids). Therefore druids are more inclined to actually enjoy and put more effort in learning. At least every single party i've joined in as a dps and there was a warrior recruited as tank before me, they 90% of the time ask me if I can tank and are insanely happy when I reply yes... this does ofc not count for all warriors, as there are those that rolled them to purely tank and do put in effort and enjoy it, but I believe that is not the majority of warriors that join parties as 'tank'.

What a piece of shit
---
My Druid mate has 5pc T1 and 2pc T2 sitting his bank.
---
He is feral.
---
I messed up my battletag name and they changed it for free.  So yeah, if you don't like it sometimes they will in fact change it for free.
---
Why does this make you upset?  I paid for this product, and I want it right.
---
It cute
---
Look at r/2007scape and search "Fire cape" and just drown in awful shit posts
---
We are relying on servers to merge in oce, i started on a low pop for the same reason and I fear that it will die out after a few months.
---
No one is talking about race changes idiot. Did you even look at the title of this post??
---
Agree. I work all day and have maybe 2 hours to play in the evenings. The server we all chose had 6 hour queues. So I played on a server with no queue and am in the same spot you are. I may start an alt on the original server. I’m cool with new friends too but it isn’t as easy as expected to find mature folks who are kind and not so self absorbed. They are out there I know but wish I knew what guild they were in.
---
He thinks you are female in RL
---
Then the kinds of reddit boards that you should be on, are the competitive min/max ones. 
---
Perfect example for me - Hearthstone. I...like you...got sick and tired of the kinds low effort and other types of posts eg. "why I'm quitting HS" that you see every few weeks(as you rightly said, no CARES, OK?), the "hahah look at this funny thing I did"(not even that funny), etc etc.
---
I did the thing that made me the happiest I've been in a while. And that's deleting the HS reddit from my bookmarks, and subscribing only to CompetitiveHS - which is still Hearthstone, but caters only to diehard players who only care about maxing out their win rate in the game. No other type of discussion is allowed or valid for that particular subreddit.
---
I'm sure such a thing exists for Classic WoW also.
---
Yeah, we use a loot council but it's more of a restricted roll system. BiS is prioritised and amount of gear/attendance is taken into account. Those who fit criteria the best do /roll
---
“First time EVER playing WoW, so proud of this moment” : lvl 60, epic mount, fully customized UI w add-ons, every ability macro’d, full current BiS. Ya okay.
---
You dont need every pattern to get to max
---
How many whelps did she drop?!
---
When you went and by yourself, that counts as a group different than when you came out and got in a group. The instances are separate for each group.
---
I'm only half joking, and half pissed because I ran BRD 20x in a row and didn't get FOW.
---
Yeah they tried to sell me minor run speed for 4g+mats.    A enchant that’s mostly usable pre 40.....
---
Now I’m leveling enchanting my self.  I ain’t buying it for that price.
---
Not something i remember reading. Most of the anecdotesive read were on the contrary of  GMs and CS staff. If you have a credible source youre welcome to share.
---
I’m also slow. I play every day and am 49. I’d like to be faster but I’ve leveled tailoring fishing and cooking. I’m cool with being a little behind in my fantasy world. It’s important to me to spend a little time in the real world too. We all enjoy the game in our own way.
---
The middle part of your comment explicitly describes the SOLO strategy. I havent seen a single AOE group only do zombies, which is exactly what you described. Your arrogance only makes you look more idiotic.
---
I’m a rogue and doing the same, I’m about 200g worth of runecloth short of Darn exalted, then I’ll start saving for the mount.
---
Because that's how things change, you don't confront the white moderate, nuh uh, never, you leave them alone and they'll change(not).
---
There are some threads with  macros that will  let you grab it by just spamming a button (or at least have a good shot at it). It's stupid but there is a lot of bad with the good in the classic.
---
No? If you're tanking then you're probably expecting to pickup tank gear. Unless otherwise stated or discussed then you shouldn't be rolling on dps gear.
---
wouldn't it be speciest? speciesist. specist.
---
When is this brief window? It's not about obsessing over meters, it's about killing things as fast as possible to save mana and other resources.
---
You only save 0.2% compared to having it at 300 IIRC, basically nothing.
---
Probably before phase 3 but nobody knows.
---
You are supposed to hide guild chat bro
---
I mc’d a hunter off the other day, and his warrior friend tried to kill me, so got him too.
---
Laughed so hard I almost forgot to get off the boat in ratchet.
---
lmao never seen this, boutta spam this on rhythm bot every time i do something mildly impressive
---
anger management gives you passive rage regen of 1 rage per 3 seconds. it's probably still worth it to you for that alone.
---
Stand corrected.
---
Rock elementals in badlands. The trash greys sell for a lot.
---
I mean currently we can reset specs up to 50g after which it would only reduce in price if you don't respec for a month. That's a bit ridiculous if you intend on raiding and pvping.
---
I'd rather have cheaper or faster price reductions for respec. That's a very good middle ground.
---
Oh ok, I think I completely misunderstood this convo. I thought people were saying a Hunter shouldn't even go for Dal Rends.
---
Is there an addon which displays item upgrade %? I liked this addon in retail because it highlighted items in different shades dependant on the upgrade %
---
I think the only way is Engi tbh... Warlock just kinda laughs at Hunter generally
---
Jfc, yes they were in vanilla. There are even interviews with the devs saying they are open to adding them to classic eventually because they were in vanilla. 
---
&gt;We're considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels. This was available in the original WoW.
---
That's from their AMA.
---
You didn’t show how you got to the spot where you started drinking noggenfoggers
---
I wouldn't consider it a huge upgrade at all. Thrash's chance on hit makes up for the lost 6 dps imo. I'm sure if we were to take a bunch of let's say 1 minute duration boss fights, Thrash would outperform Krol in a lot of them. All it takes is 1, maybe 2 procs to surpass Krol. Krol will raise your avg dps a bit, but Thrash allows for more dps spikes and to reach higher numbers than Krol when you're lucky. I would only get Krol if it was under 100g. I don't believe its worth much.
---
Why do you care so much dude? There will always be shitty people in the world,  you not gonna say your romantic  life is ruined just bcs you last tinder date didn't wanted to split the bill on top of ordering extra dessert and  drinks plus blocked you afterwards. You will meet lots of good people and also shit people that's normal and you should get used atleast. If you are not min max. Type of player don't join those kind of groups maybe make your own group etc. Play just with friends. And like minded players.
---
I wonder if a mage could do this 🤔 i really need my pants
---
Yeah same.... Huge drop off. Without Layering, this wouldv been a disaster.
---
Hahaha this is awesome
---
    /cast !Shoot
---
Yall are such douche bags. Your gfs are probably cheating on you.
---
I find it's better to search in major cities, or to join /world (/join World in game) and try there.  
---
However I want to offer an alternative. I think you should join a guild that has several players at or around your level and attempt to find a group with guildmates first. It will almost always improve the quality of your groups.
---
I was in THE BADLANDS. Most boring zone in the game.
---
I was killing my 60th earth elemental for a scroll piece when I heard the sound of something sealthing. I steal myself and pop off the human ability to boost finding stealth targets. There lies a horde druid I'd killed 10 minutes prior. He couldn't see me, but was obviously  looking for me. Seeing if I was still around.
---
I got behind him and ambushed him, He changed to cheeta and ran off...and i chased him down with the rogue speed ability and he died in the centre of the badlands.
---
I got my drop 5 minutes later.
---
Haha there's the real answer
---
Jeez people. Sure the OP is a rude dude. But talking so disgustingly about his girl, who has said or done nothing is just super not nice.
---
Lvl 60 priest on old Blanchy...  deleted everything and gave to friend. Re rolled on PvP white mane and now have a lvl 37 priest.. 
---
I feel your pain, i play in the middle of the night till morning so it was almost impossible to get a 60+ dungeon going. Felt absolutely no want/ need to solo play anymore. 
---
100x better on a server that’s not dead.
---
It will be hard to level enchanting on dungeon drops alone, and it will also cut *significantly* into your gold from vendoring stuff, so no mount anywhere near 40, etc.
---
Tailoring is very cheap to level atm, since cloth is sold almost for vendor price. I don't know if there's still much demand for low level bags, then tailoring is basically free to level. However it's a pretty junk profession - you don't get to make gold with it besides selling mooncloth cooldown. Priests/mages and possibly warlocks will want it to craft their class robes, and mages/warlocks will eventually want it for bloodvine set bonus, and that's it. There's nothing you can craft besides bags that will be in demand.

I thought boar pet charge was only a root, not an interrupt. You sure it stops casting?
---
Don't have the time to, there are some days I only have up to an hour to do things on Classic.
---
I get my ass railed every time I log on as Ally, so I'd say yes.
---
You can't copare yourself to someone doing level-speedrunning if you are leveling your professions, discoverig the game, reading your quests, or so.
---
You should not worry about your leveling time. As long as it dosen't get you bored or frustrated, you are doing right.
---
And keep in mind Johana didn't level professions (except first aid), didn't earned any gold before l60 (throwing greys away and only keeping quest items), and borrowed gold to get his mount lvl 40.
---
RIP mage
---
These are getting cuter and funnier.

I'm what y'all would call a "boomer" - I don't do Instagram nor do I care about Karma. It's been like 4 years and I have 7K, but maybe I'm just bad at it ;)

You can name change in classic. There’s only one way. 
---
Erase the character 
---
Wait 30 Days
---
Make the same name on the same server 
---
Restore deleted character 
---
After 30 days deleted characters lose their name privileges.

its not random, some mobs build up attacks while being kited and let multiple out at once
---
Government's paying for em. They're basically running public service and I bet they're charging an insane fee from Thrall n friends!
---
&gt; I havent seen a single AOE group only do zombies, which is exactly what you described.
---
so anecdotal evidence suggests that I'm wrong and you're right?
---
all of my runs leveling were doing the mummies method, we never completed stairs. sometimes we done scarabs. 
---
i'm not saying you're wrong, but from my experience that's what we done and it's doable. why would you think it isn't? 
---
&gt; Your arrogance only makes you look more idiotic.
---
i'm not here on reddit to boast what i know/how much i know/how good or bad i am.
---
someone asked a question, and i answered that he can farm mummies with an aoe group from 51 to 52. what's your problem trying to pick apart everything i say?
---
Gotta look at BoEs like money - not item. Its just as useful for the others in the group, as the gold value will help cover their respective BiS gear. 
---
Same reason why I hate for instance, when healers need on Dark Runes in Scholo. Ofc the healer will need this in raids, but it would equally cover the cost of other classes consumables which they need equally as much. (Unless ofcourse they are having a hard time in the dungeon and needs them for use right away, then Id consider the case a bit differently I must admit)
---
At 60 my Warrior spouse and I (Holy Priest) chained Princess runs to get him that darn ring. It took over 30 runs for it to finally drop.  Right afterwards we went to Winterspring to farm for my Eye of Shadow. The Eye dropped within 15 minutes!
---
Weird what people will downvote.  I just find UBRS really fun, why the hate?
---
I’m not saying it’s golden content, but what do you visit this sub for? The game is fifteen years old.
---
Dumb question but what do you need to do or wear to bump up your healing crit as a Paladin?
---
Awesome man very cool
---
Seemed more sarcastic than grumpy.
---
not to my knowledge
---
I play on a fairly Horde dominant server and I don't have many problems getting ganked, except in STV which is basically unplayable.
---
i submitted a report so we will see what happens
---
High elves hate them because night elves banned arcane magic after the sundering and breaking this law was punishable by death. High elves were suffering magic withdrawals and spoke out against. Instead of killing so many of their kin, night elves exiled them.
---
You really should take this video down, Because Blizz has been known to ban people for Exploits like this.
---
I know it's not what I would call an "Exploit" but I hate to watch Blizz ban people for making their own fun.
---
Raided mc with a feral in cat tonight. Same feeling.
---
I love this stuff
---
But I like fun casual 10 mans.  Not sure where the downvotes came from.
---
Really if you want to go balance you need to go deep enough into restoration to get reflection so you have some mana regeneration, which mean no moonkin form.
---
Before anyone asks, I did return the favor.
---
We only have 2 hunters in our roster right now as the other 2 are still leveling - needless to say, they're almost fully decked out, too. Onyheads are still out to melee first though.
---
You mean the "inherent racism" of one Paladin in TFT?
---
Riddle me that one, champ.
---
I’m an alliance on white mane and I haven’t seen much of either. It’s surprisingly really chill to quest. I’m new to the PvP server so I attack 80% of horde I see. Obviously not low levels like greys but I don’t mind melting a guy right next to me while he’s fighting something with low health. 
---
Most of the times I want to kill a horde while a got a party member right there with me, and it’s a easy 2v1 my buddy usually never butts in and has me 1v1. 
---
The only time I don’t kill horde if I plan on staying in that spot for a long time since I don’t want to get the back lash so I do it only when I’m rotating grind spots or quests.
---
what consumes do they drop?
---
I’m so confused.  Did you forget to switch to your alt account?
---
Yea the challenge for the druid is making the raid, not winning the loot.
---
Sunk cost fallacy
---
Its World of Warcraft not World of Peacecraft traitor! LOL
---
How much is that thing worth? Is it a shield?
---
Does Onyxia reset threat in phase3?  How does that work?
---
Shadow Reflectors are fucking hilarious, managed to get a lock to /afk out of a bg in rage after reflecting his Deathcoil back in vanilla days. Absolutely recommend.
---
I’ve wondered this but have never risked trying it
---
Glad I’ve seen this post now.
---
I wanted to make sure I had it right! 😄 You fuckn filth
---
Willingly chose to not wait in queue for 7 hours...
---
This is probably where you find ashbringer.
---
This works super well, if everyone is in on it. Most groups arent though. In those groups i usually just do single target with some cone of colds mixed in. Watching my aggro. 
---
But if the pull has non elite mobs with normal amount of hp i usually just mow them down with a nova, flamestrike/cone of cold shatter combo. They die before the tank notices he lost aggro anyway and speeds up the run a lot without being a "omg lol aoe everything" dumbass mage.
---
Does anyone know the quest chain for Into The Scarlet Monastery?
---
That rage you feel when drinking that water for full duration, is the same rage everyone feels when they see you. Just know we only tolerate your bullshit because you are a vending machine.
---
Not much. Yes.
---
If you are on our server, you can mark us and go afk and we will throw loot at you. There arent nearly enough druids at 60.
---
You should roll horde and become best friends
---
I’m new to the internet. What is a PUG.
---
Let's face it, the only reason why SC was made "racist" was because Blizzard wanted to re-use them for Alliance quests. It was always stupid and lazy.
---
All boats are like this. It has always been that way. You  also used to get diminishing returns on honor against the same player.
---
Lol'd @ tooting
---
I would have be disappointed in you if you had saved him.
---
Twoomkin
---
He pulled too much, that's his fault. You offered to help but he turned it down when he declined your invite for a selfish, stupid reason. In the long run, the amount he would have lost from grouping for this one quest would be nothing. I hope you /laugh 'd at his corpse.
---
On a separate note, why did you buy your skills from Undercity? Did you do the starter quests in Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine Forest and didn't have honored with Orgrimmar yet?
---
One guy was mad about it but loot rules were discussed beforehand. Same reasoning as you: it was a pug no significant portion of the raid was one guild, so gearing out a tank isn't a priority. So I said it'd be open roll on bindings for rogues and warriors. At least I didn't reserve it or something :P
---
What’s spy
---
what server is this garbage happening on? my troll brother needs an a attitude adjustment.
---
Eh, two out of three
---
Feralas might be good for you, then badlands afterwards
---
I think we all agree that you should delete this.
---
Cool so maybe I will be an undead gnome, hope they dont mind.
---
badass shield a friend said i can basically buy my mount by selling it
---
In a pug? Everyone needs on high value BOE items.  
---
If you want to reserve loot; state it beforehand and run master looter, or run with friends/guild.
---
Once got bitched out by a mage I didn't heal who was aoe grinding all the quest mobs in an area and scuffed his pull. 
---
Some people just deserve to die
---
Damn.. My guild used to require us to bring 2 greater fire protection potions for ony and the same for rag. To ensure a smooth boss kill while people are in crap gear. Now the guild pays for them with gold made from selling stuff made with recipes we've gotten. I love my guild.
---
I still bring some consumes to do more damage though, because i like to compete with the other mages for fun.
---
Vanish has always been buggy
---
after reading your side of the story and looking at the SS (you get a + for not using your phone to take it) these players are not Min/Max'ers they are bad players with poor social skills :)  Ignore them and move on and be thankful you got to 57 before running into these types of players.
---
The best way is to mass pm all people in the level range. You can for example type /who warrior 30-35 and just whisper like 40 people. You need like 30s only to do that
---
Its by far the fastest way to find people
---
Love the idea but highly doubt they can do this without further diluting classes and roles. Let's hope they focus on unique class identity and play styles again in Wow 2
---
The konk boys are getting too powerful
---
Little man. Put that shit.. in my hand.
---
it's 20g on Zandalar Alliance, 75G is insane lol
---
Oh I’ve done that dozens of times
---
He was trying to give her his snake
---
Low effort, thisll be gone when the kids wake up
---
Uncontested openers = fuck that particular class with a deadzone
---
it also takes 5 seconds to get out of combat, which is very useful to know in pvp
---
It sucks but this *is* part of the classic experience. And I mean it suuuucks hard but something like this happens to pretty much everyone.  
---
Be like the reed in the wind... and let that shit blow past you.
---
As a paladin I can't relate lol
---
Get atlas loot addon, you can check dungeons by levels and all the loot from each boss and trash. Really helpful. The dungeons are in order as well.
---
My guild has 8 hunters lol and 5 rogues so it’s lit
---
Enjoy having a totally empty mana bar that never refills!
---
Double cringe
---
Rogue and warr guaranteed openers
---
Hunter pre trap not permitted
---
A little obvious eh
---
DPS isn't what matters. It's damage done.
---
WoW 2 was my line of thinking. I should have made it more clear that I don't think they could or even should implement this into the current game. In general, it'd be difficult to implement in MMOs. You obviously don't want anyone playing one race or one faction, because they made a niche aspect of the character strong as all shit.
---
Just an idea I had for an ideal case of character identity.
---
No ones telling you to browse the internet. Leave the moderation to the mods.
---
Please comment on the Opener rules vs hunter
---
They do dmg but they’re always oom
---
Addon that gives you a pop up when enemy players are around
---
&gt; Would you take them in a dungeon?  
---
Sure. Dungeons are easy.  
---
&gt; A raid?  
---
A guild raid, no. Another mage is more useful. A pug or shitter raid sure, current raid content is very easy.  
---
&gt; Do you feel they are completely inferior to other mage dps  
---
I'm sure people have thrown down some huge DPS parses on a boomkin, but the long run favors a mage for raiding.  
---
&gt; the resto druid?  
---
Yes, inferior, even though resto druid themselves are pretty shit-tier until later raid gear.  
---
&gt; Have you encountered one in PvP?  
---
Not full boomkin unless in AV which is more PVE than PVP. Any PVP druid worth his gold, even balance focused, will spec to NS for PVP.
---
I am in the same predicament. My ping hovers around 75 and hurts me a lot in pvp. I basically can’t do anything and I’m a mage. Aoe with latency issues plus spell batching . It sucks
---
Maybe it did t get picked up? Like you didnt click on it. Or if you have auto loot, your inv was full?
---
assuming much.
---
No. If the guy didn't want to group, him pulling too many mobs is his problem, not yours. However, unless him not joining you somehow screwed you over, then there really was no reason to not help either. Sometimes people just want to solo for little and it has nothing to do with you. Maybe he had a bad day and just wanted to kill shit alone and work that anger out. Now, his reaction was uncalled for so yeah, fuck that guy.  He died because he wanted to play solo, that's on him amd and it's not your responsibility to back him up.
---
Whats wrong with people sharing what they found joyful?
---
I'm not allowed to talk about a succulent meal I had with company because they ate the same food too?
---
real question is who cares.
---
Pretty sure most people who've played MMOs for 13 years know basic camera controls, it's just the tab-targeting that isn't obvious or even necessary. I still remember when Wrath or Cata came out and you could just push a spell and it would auto-target to whatever you were facing towards. Even clicking on someone and pressing F to see what their target is was common knowledge in my time.
---
Sure they can, but it can be a hassle to keep an extra set while leveling, and ultimately your set is likely to miss pieces and be behind, since you're choosing quest gear for feral and you're not expected to take healing gear in dungeons unless nobody needs the item if you're not healing, which you probably won't if you don't have the gear. Not to mention the extra gear set takes up a lot of space. Way easier to just tank, which there's high demand for
---
hmmm that's hot garbage. I thought racial weapon spec traits were a bigger deal, or is that more so for levels &lt;60?
---
right no way you could get there on your own unless maybe with invisi pots
---
Epic mount, farm gold for surplus consumables, farm PVP gear.  
---
Get all of this done before raiding starts and you'll have the most relaxed raiding experience. No need to play 24/7. Could honestly raid log and take some time away from the game after the long grind.
---
I like how they balanced the hunter game by allowing guaranteed deadzone into spamstring/cripp while banning precast traps.
---
Do what you will but I have seen reports of people being banned for that. There seems be a grey area on if that us exploiting and GMs seem likely to just ban.
---
You sound like a fuckin dunce lmao
---
Just a picture of an irl owl with photoshopped staff
---
get healer gear so you get invited to mc when your guild mates reach lvl 60
---
They're a huge deal in PVE because there's a *huge* penalty for being more than 2 levels (10 weapon skill) below your target, and +5 racial is just enough to avoid that penalty vs raid bosses. Outside of this huge jump, it makes much less of a difference.
---
Hope so. Lagged out in capitol cities.. lagged in end gsne territories.. switched.
---
No lag outside cities but the worlds a ghost town. 😐
---
A player 5 levels below mine killed me in Ratchet while I was afk and spat on my course.  I tracked him down in the Swamp of Sorrows after an hour of searching and killed him.   This was the moment I remembered why I love this game.
---
Just go on lol
---
If this ruins your classic experience then you’re really not made for mmo games
---
I’m lvl 55 and still skinning and selling thick and rugged leather between 1.3g and 1.8-2.0g
---
People aren’t even permanently banned for hacking, making death threats, spamming racial slurs, or anything else.  I wouldn’t expect much.
---
auto loot on inv not full
---
The good thing about locks is that most of their damage comes from dots so they normally don’t take aggro. They also usually don’t go hellfire in the middle of nowhere till they know tank has aggro or they won’t die etc.
---
As long as they’re taking damage from themselves they have their own tools to restore it so don’t worry about them. When it’s time to drink between pulls they will eat/drink just like any mage
---
Level an alt (a class your guild is lacking in), max out professions including first aid and fishing, grind reps specifically argent dawn, timbermaw, and what you can for cenarion circle for recipes and future raid advantages, help guildies with questing/dungeons (taking a guildie through low level dungeons just for loot a couple times can really speed up their leveling since they don't have to fight for the gear).... there is tons to do.
---
Open world simulator = no spy add on, hunter spots rogue with tracking, hunter's mark, forcing vanish.
---
Whoever designed these rules never played a hunter or hates them.
---
He's guaranteeing an archilles heel with those guaranteed openers into deadzone. The pretrapping rule is retarded,could do without. 
---
It's very blatant.
---
That doesn’t work.
---
Instead of suspensions players like this should have gear, gold, or attunements removed.  These guys don’t give a shit about a three day suspension.
---
NAILED HIM.
---
Molten core fights are the opposite of long though. Bossfights are around 30secs to 1.5mins long. Perfect conditions for Boomkins.
---
Because rogues never fight mobs yeah?
---
All spell casters do magic damage. But only certain specs will do shadow damage (affliction warlock and shadow priest for example)
---
Just managed to complete it myself!
---
Wouldn’t expect many 12 year olds to have enigma armor  and sets
---
Respec cost is good for the economy.
---
Spell dmg increase your dmg skill dmg, shadow dmg increase your only shadow spell like shadow bolt, if im not mistaken all the warlock skill is shadow spell so it dsnt matter to you if its spell dmg or shadow
---
the alliance on my server have spent so much time camping hillsbrad fields just to grief low levels, so much so that a lot of us log out in tarren mill when leveling our alts just so if we see some of these guys show up we can run them off.
---
people on reddit like to act like the alliance is so innocent but like any group, there are lots of them and there are bound to be losers shitting on lower levels, which in turn just makes the other faction shit on their low levels in retaliation
---
who won?
---
Press F
---
Yeah this is how I remember it too. The tree gotta open it and then you need to kill the boss to reach the cave area behind him, doesn't it bust open with imps coming our or similar?
---
NTA. If he wanted to group up, he had the option.
---
I’m in a guild called &lt;Say the Word&gt; it’s honesty pretty great. People help each other out with a lot, Ive seen officers help lowbies who are getting ganked multiple times, chat is usually really active, and there’s not the “inner circle” you generally get with a lot of guilds. 
---
I’m honestly a lower ranking member, but they helped me get the last part of my onyxia attunement done last night even though everyone else already finished it. 
---
Can’t really comment on the discord as I haven’t joined it yet, but I like the guild a lot. Lmk if you’re interested and I can send an inv
---
Hunters, druids, alliance warlocks are always geared up because there’s not many of them in a raid.
---
No?
---
Maybe go outside and enjoy some sun light
---
id charge at least 40g an hour to boost anyone. probably more.
---
make an alt.
---
Ahhh that's a good one as well.
---
that would be awesome!  I love people sharing their joy..
---
I love this stuff. Any YouTube tutorials on how to do it?

My answer to this as a was raid as arms with a 2h. My guild doesn’t care and my dps isn’t terrible, plus when I don’t top charts I just step out of MC and crit a clothie and everything is ok again.
---
Next time make sure u muder him. 🙂
---
Oh, the hand is real - it’s just that free markets (outside of finance and some raw commodities) aren’t.
---
Every class is buggy and clunky to play. I miss private servers.

Damn. You just go around being a total douche.
---
^^^^ My main way of doing dungeons
---
Priest killed me on the boat to Ratchet from STV just tonight...
---
If there are dogs in the group attacking you they can see through stealth and you come out right away. The big fire mobs also have an aoe fire attack that goes out in a circle. BRD is rough for rogues in some ways and great in others. (Yay for free LP skillups!)
---
Thanks for the advice.  I am in a guild, I just am usually on when not a lot of people in the guild are.  Due to my schedule and timezone difference.  (Didn't know it was an East coast server when I'm on West)
---
Either a second roll behind the scenes, or the number generated is actually a float (decimal), and just the whole number portion is displayed in the UI.
---
Rouges are overpowdered.
---
Ah cool didn't know that. Thanks and I'm glad you broke out of your slavery. Unfortunately, all undead must be purged and I apologize in advance if we run into each other.
---
Is there an addon that shows me instantly in the frame which class I'm targeting when I target another player?
---
Felstriker?
---
boomer humour
---
Its fine dude, myself and all my friends were the same at the time. You get a load of gold from lvl 38-41 even if you just chain farm scarlet as many times as you can.
---
For context, I usually have 2-15 bag slots.  My mana gems plus a food and water for me.  I can make ~12 stacks.   Each conjure takes a quarter to a fifth of my mana, and 3 seconds.  I could evocate for 6 seconds.  But it takes a good 50-200 seconds to make that conjured spread of buns and water...
---
No
---
I know how I felt reaching those milestones and I agree it’s an exciting thing. I also know I never felt the need to post them on the internet for random strangers to see and accept praise from.
---
thank you. I hope you’re not human. ;)
---
&gt; Is it common for Horde players to gank lowbies?
---
They always do it
---
This sounds like a beat add-on. I will take a crack at it this week.
---
Some are fire, but for pve only the shadow spells are needed
---
Play a moba.
---
Except it isn't because NPCs have increased melee reach in Classic (note: not VANILLA, but CLASSIC), so you'll never get out of range after your swing before they've hit you again. 
---
I've tried the lauded "hamstring method" enough times against random shitty boars and bandits and whatnot and had it not work at all that I'm convinced people who recommend it are just doing it because they've been told to and not because it works. 
---
Which it doesn't. For the aforementioned reason.
---
cept warriors can just tank dungeons. and most dungeons, if done fast enough, will give you 10-20g an hour PLUS potential blue/epic boe's.
---
which is exactly what an undergeared mage would make trying too aoe in the supposed "best" place aka ZF. its not like EVERY mage is just going too magically make it work.
---
yes mages CAN make alot of money, but it requires alot of effort early on or gear+epic mount. (epic mount allows the mage too round up all the mobs in one go to aoe, while a normal mount isnt fast enough to keep them from taking dmg)
---
with Diremaul this could change, it could be super easy and every mage will be a billionaire, but as it stands now. aoe farming ZF is less effective for most mages compared too simply running dungeons. which anyone can do
---
now the general mage life is super easy. we get free water/food, we can teleport, good dmg, lots of CC. honestly one of the most stacked classes.
---
but when it comes to making money, its more about the player not just the class.
---
Oh, I should have specified mine was for perceived difficulty.
---
I'm not the one to make this judgment or try to convince that it is OK to do, the GMs who have been banning people for it are. There have multiple reports of it on this sub. I'm not going to do it but feel free to roll the dice if you want.
---
"Are black lotuses even in the game?" lol
---
I feel you brother
---
So many arbitrary rules just so we can sit through 6 hours of Mages sheeping and resetting and still have a SL Warlock win the tournament. I don’t understand why they are allowing food? I used to duel a lot and it was always considered lame to eat in a duel.
---
This is my *favorite* part of classic. Please post photos of the village!
---
Gathermate is pretty nice if you have a gathering profession or want to remember chest locations for new toons.
---
Every pug I’ve been in; everyone rolls Need on expensive boe’s.  Its the only way to protect the whole group from ninjas.
---
Yes
---
*exposed*
---
Reputation gives discount on skills? I bought the mount from ogrimmar but was going to UC for skulls only because I had quests to turn in.
---
Yeah, fuck people for enjoying things.
---
I had no idea. Thanks for the tip!
---
Druid diffiulty lvl in dungeon.
---
Feral cat &lt; Resto &lt; feral bear &lt; Oomkin
---
Two hand tank all the way through sm. Hell, people are getting away with it at 60.
---
u can grind winter saber rep
---
With two heal over times you shouldn’t be running into many situations like this. You can also disengage with dash if you need to.
---
Surefooted
---
The devour magic ability is very strong. Its purge and dispel in one ability. Felhound makes warlocks a nightmare against mages. You can consume their shields and silence them
---
Agreed to a certain extent. I don't agree that gear, gold and attunements are removed, but perhaps a temporary suspension of their ability to use their professions? Removing all gear, gold and attunements can be a massive blow and could lead to a worse outcome.
---
However banning them for 6 months is definitely insane since they're *paying* for those 6 months, and it would be a pretty good way of losing customers.
---
If you take a 3rd tier talent in the resto tree you cant take moonkin? You need to learn to count again mate
---
That’s alliance only.
---
Then tell me something like, *is that it?*. I know whatcha tryna say girl: Aw yeah that's it!
---
Unfortunately your dream won’t become a reality.
---
That'd be pretty hypocritical!
---
There’s more to get past than that will allow
---
Damn bro, chill.
---
That one stung me, and I'm a hunter.
---
Activate windows haha
---
I really like the chest for dungeons. In a guild group with a dualwielding/2hand warriors charging in, there is no way, a tank holds aggro. Therefore having 400 health (with the +100 health enchant) and plate armor really helps alleviating the incoming damage and makes it managable for the healer. I exclusively wear plate for dungeon running.
---
i reloaded. i can try that tho
---
Arh yes, the logic that made the rise of the flat earth movement a thing.
---
Well, I wouldnt falsely claim I did it in 1 pull, I would say I did it in 3, just like you show on the video.
---
not bad but not as much as i hoped
---
And fuck blizzard for retconning it out and putting thrall with some basic orc booty.
---
True, but I’ve seen a lot of Druids. Literally first one in boomkin form
---
Giant ahead therefore try head
---
Well to start with you need to meet lvl 40 balance druid for him to be able to get OOMkin form.
---
g o t o r e t a i l    there you can get the ivory one
---
You can start doing Golem runs in BRD at 52. At 55 you can do full BRD runs.
---
Unless you get lucky and get everything you want from shallow BRD before 55, then yeah pretty much.
---
I started BRD at 52, didn't really do any non-dungeon quests all the way to 60
---
Enjoy the journey man. A day spent doing things like this instead of mindless leveling breaks up the monotony. It's literally why I prefer classic. 
---
I'm barely level 30 but I ended up healing a 10 man deadmines raid with my friends the other day. You can't get that experience in retail. It was a blast. Total waste of my time? Yeah. Worth it for the memories? For sure.
---
Paranoia from fehunter is stealth detection not invisibility detection as a heads up.
---
Wait so is immolate not used at all? That seems weird to me.
---
I saw it 2-3 times in vanilla, and had the chestpiece made before I saw the BP of Valor drop.
---
Its lvl 40 balance tree talent.
---
Nothing worse than clipping microphones... Set up your shit correctly, guys.
---
Meanwhile Goratha will never see dalrend drop 😄
---
The way you got these was just having an epic mount before the new epic mount skins were added to the game. When they added the new epic mount skins, they never forced people to switch; it was a turnin that traded your old one for the new one. People that have them on live are people who decided never to do that turnin. I guess they don't plan on ever adding these to classic.
---
LOL I spit my water out everywhere watching this 5x times hahahahahahahaha
---
I think the best way to sum up loot council is a system where players actively decide who gets, or gets to roll, on what they're able to use. As opposed to any form of mathematical system.
---
I am a warrior tank from vanilla, tbc and wrath. I have always tanked deep prot and wanted to try doing a fury prot build at 60. A major reason for this is so that I can firstly be able to farm mobs when I am not tanking, secondly so I might be able to get a raid spot as fury if necessary because I suspect in raids it will be hard for me to land a tank spot and thirdly just because I really think it is a pretty cool idea.
---
What I am trying to find is a pre-raid phase 1 + DM BiS list for fury prot. It mostly needs agility stamina and +hit plate. I have heard this is a difficulty in phase 1 to find. But if anyone could find something that would be great. I have been googling furiously (pun intended ;) ) trying to find the answer.
---
Alliance and horde act is exactly the same way
---
How the heck did you track him down on the other side of Azeroth??
---
Have you read the first comments?
---
+36 frost damage was 30 gold on my server and +34 frost damage 3 golds lol.
---
His point is that they are cartelizing to create artificially high prices, ie - a colluding oligopoly.
---
His lowering the price dramatically could be just a correction in that case.
---
Hunters and occasionally druids get gear funneled to them due to low count in raids
---
I just downvoted your comment.

# FAQ
---
# What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
# Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
* Spreading incorrect information,
---
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
---
# Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
# I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
Probably the part where they abused an automated reporting system to strip him of critical game features to stop him, in multiple violations of the TOS?
---
Wholesome
---
They removed them from the game entirely because they felt the limited time nature, if they were keeping true to vanilla, would cause unhealthy gameplay of racing to buy the mount.
---
Side effect being, no one gets those mounts now.
---
Does this really work? As in you can spam this and it won’t cancel shoot if it’s active already?
---
Unfortunate I posted that comment at work, and I am still... at work. I wont have long to play before I have to go to sleep because I work 12 hour shifts, but ill give it a look and report back. I am more focused on hitting 60 so I can safely farm essence of water for archmage robe atm.
---
That's stupid. Is there a limit of "armor of up to 1500" to make it easier for rogues or warriors?
---
I don't think you could name any times where high elves were actively racist against night elves
---
#1 rule in 8g, it's just content
---
Mages attract a lot of noobs.. when a new player asks “what should I play I want to do good dps” the reply is normally mage since well, it it’s true. So these guys end up not knowing anything about mage or maybe they even don’t like mage, they just want to do “top dps”.
---
It’s the same type if player that will swap of mage the second it gets nerfed or something else becomes the new fotm. 
---
Comparatively, everyone who chose to play a warlock, Druid, hunter etc knew what they wanted to play and are the type that wild stick to it even if it was bad.
---
It’s the same.
---
There are people using reddit as social media and other use it as a classical forum.
---
These two worlds are colliding from time to time...
---
Mages too! It really helps a lot if you have one of the trinkets that'll summon a mob to proc her aoe though.
---
no im not. im calling him out for his bs.
---
fuck me mate, get some binds done. Don't you even dare to tell me you are clicking all them spells with your mouse or touch pad
---
Always had the most fun with warrior. Tank in dungeons/raids and pvp as arms. Especially if you duo with someone, warrior pairs well with a lot classes.
---
It's more of a story-boarding presentation of the quests. I did enjoy it, but sometimes it felt overwhelming whereas Immersion can be allowed to flow as part of background noise if you don't want to follow the quests as tightly as Storyline forces.
---
Gifs that end too soon
---
would that be a good lvl for me as a rouge to start grinding for that stuff at?
---
i strongly agree.
---
You’re still luckier than 99% of people.
---
He is definitely a ninja, but I also do agree that everyone should be rolling need and they're dumb not to.
---
Nah, Guidelime is a platform other people can make guides for, I haven't explored it much I only came into contact because Hakurai recommended it when someone translated his guide to it. You have guidelime as an addon and then the guides are dependencies you can load. There's a few trial ones included that do like to level 20 but i didn't look into them at all.
---
Org taxpayers are taking the hit for free public transit.
---
Healcomm it's just a must have for any healer.
---
Why no dungeon finder?? After a 10 year hiatus, I'm finding that getting groups together without the dungeon finder takes so much incredibly longer that I don't have time to run anything in the 1 or 2 hour windows I have. Is putting groups together to experience instance content really what killed wow?
---
Argent Dawn exalted.
---
I think you're right but I still use the add-on and move around like I'm doing something out of habit. I'll probably remove it. The other problem (bug) seems to be mobs being able to parry and block when attacked from behind. I thought they could dodge, but I don't remember them doing all that in Vanilla.
---
That Horde player clearly just respects your name Ocarina, a throwback to Zelda, plus your hard earned SM gear, and of course, dat booty.
---
Would recommend bloodfang with medium/high population and basically 50/50 faction balance. If you want an overpopulated server and often wait in queues, go gehennas .
---
Strength also helps blocks more damage, so it's actually 7 str &gt; 1 dps
---
There is a warning prompt before you can unlearn your talents, indicating cost.
---
Be quicker to hit that ignore button. Its your friend :  )
---
Vuhdo does more, is less buggy, and is more accurate health-wise. I made the switch a couple weeks back and the difference is staggering. I highly recommend it.
---
It takes more initial setup though, but it's entirely worth it.
---
Not really.  Spells don't even hit that hard and you need a ton of crit to overcome that.
---
Lmao my logic exactly. You are literally running Mara anyway, it’s not like you’re going out of your way to get me the black stone ring.. 10-20g is enough, you get all the drops as per normal anyway. 
---
75g? What the fuck man
---
it's called sharing with your community...which is exactly what you are doing. you didn't need to come on here and rag on people for sharing their experiences any more than they needed to share their experiences...yet here we are.
---
That bring is to 8%,which is still 1% short of cap
---
And incidentally one of the most creative bits of content ever. ICC was decent as well, though.
---
I never use it unless it's a boss fight. I'm specced to have 3 instants dots then life drain. No point in spending the time to cast it
---
Tbh i think they should only allow 1 set of items with only trinkets and weapons swapable.
---
They are indeed trying to Balance this too hard Tbh.
---
wouldnt it have said he won it?
---
Only the muting system is automated, to get banned someone does look at the reports. After making a ticket they’ll investigate and most likely the ones abusing the reports will be banned. So yeah they can’t do anything about it
---
They didn't have open-ended server transfers the first time around and they won't this time, either.
---
They had server transfers but they were only from certain to specific realms. They weren't from wherever you are to wherever you want to go, which is what many people might be asking and hoping for when server transfers are allowed.
---
If this is all it took, your experience wasn't all that great to begin with.
---
I agree.
---
Good people be good people*
---
100% Oprah honest it was just for standing in the no aggro zones and not for being on roofs or chains or other "guards cant acess" areas. There were huge debates about it in the threads. I'm on my phone now but tomorrow I'll get on the computer and find a link for ya.
---
No Immolation aura either, so the flight master doesnt enter combat.
---
Get Atlas addon, it has entrance maps for some of the more difficult to navigate dungeons.
---
Here's what Mara looks like: https://i.imgur.com/jPbUtpG.png
---
Generally you keep going down until you arrive at point A, from there you decide if you want to go left for purple side or right for orange side. There's also the middle path which leads to the place where you can teleport to the middle of the dungeon if you have the scepter.
---
I first met this Dwarf Rogue farming earth elementals in Badlands. He had managed some parkour and jumped on a cliff where he stood dancing with all Horde. Kept running into the fellow in Booty Bay, and other 30-45 areas over the next week.
---
He always spammed emotes, and did the common "me lo ve y o u" et cetera.
---
It all took a weird turn in Gadgetzan a week later. After a couple of /flirt and /kiss he used his alliance-&gt;horde speech to suggest acts of a more vulgar nature.
---
Moral is, stay away from dwarves. They only want one thing.
---
It's not tho.
---
In classic, a Druid’s biggest strength was their flexibility. Need an additional off-tank for boss? Turn into bear. Need some extra heals? A Druid can do it. Need a extra DPS? Go cat for melee and Boomkin for ranges (although I don’t know too many raid bosses where an extra melee vs ranged DPS would make a difference.)
---
The best Druids are able to do anything well, and are willing to do anything. A boomkin Druid is fine, but a Druid player who ONLY wants to boomkin is awful.
---
You do know that shield blocks prevent critical hits and aren't for the armor value alone?!
---
Gay
---
was running it with a pug and nobody knew what to do with the carapace so they gave it to me. the rogue. thanks i guess.
---
I mean this would have been better if you used the upcoming 55 waters instead, as it stands I already have both of these at home
---
O the feels, the damn feels :'(
---
But what about the ~~droid attack on the wookies?~~ tauren?
---
wdym? we pay it in taxes where do you think all the respec money goes to?
---
Unless you go MC with like 25 players to maximize loot per player
---
I bet you are Alliance. With no mail agi users and low hunter numbers in raids its indeed an easy to outgear rest of the raid.
---
Okay I know it's a meme.....
---
But this is a much better love story than twilight... .
---
I created 5 alts to collect all the different mats I get with my main. Then I saw the huge rested xp bonus on them and started leveling those. Now I slowly level alts to get all professions up in order to make room for the mats without spending gold, but making some.
---
I didn't come back to this in a timely manner sorry - What Fury does really well is scale better than Prot, most of the threat gen of Prot is innate numbers added flatly onto the damage, revenge, sheild slam, sunder etc. I'd get the same bonus threat from it in dungeon blues as I do full tier 3. What Fury-prot does is shift your threat gen from bonuses to damage, which will scale with gear and raid buffs. It also allows you to generate more of your own rage via flurry.
---
With the DPS reasonable players who can read a guide are capable of doing now I expect a lot more raids will find themselves threat capped than they did in the past. For reference I'm seeing full blue geared players doing considerably more DPS than most of the tier 2 players I did AQ40 with in 2006. Fury prot will allow them to unload harder, so shorter kill times, less overall damage and the healers come out ahead because they aren't budgeting for a long fight.
---
Realistically it works because the bottom half of the prot tree doesn't really offer anything other than utility skills until you hit shield slam.
---
What I would say as someone running the spec at the moment is that you lose a lot of utility. You don't have tactical mastery so I can't intercept, mocking blow as easily and even charging is less appealing as I either have to use the rage in battle stance or lose it.
---
For Warriors? Try the Gnomeregan leather quest pants. Significantly better.
---
Nah, the forsaken is a bunch of misunderstood morally grey guys who are hated by the world for no good reason.
---
Now excuse me as I complete a quest to give a puppy something called an elixir of pain
---
 Report in game, dont try to start witch hunts here.
---
It's incredibly difficult to balance, so once they decided that they don't want one faction to have a competitive edge over the other, that kinda stopped working. They experimented with giving alliance and horde paladins different seals in TBC and had to take that back as well.
---
This is, without exaggeration, the 5th post I’ve seen of someone “clipping” into a tiny ledge of a boat just in time before it leaves... not today, mind you, I’m talking on this subreddit ever, but still...
---
Nope does not increase wand dmg
---
I think that was actually the original lore behind the Argent Crusade. It was the **Argent** dawn and the Scarlet **Crusade** combined around Tirion purifying Ashbringer. But for w/e reason they decided to have them continue to be evil and slip more and more into doom. 
---
I think it's because they really were trying to sell the Alliance as goodie goodies combined with they wanted to keep the dungeons around.
---
My most important ele shaman rotation:
---
Log in, look for mages around me
---
Rofl, your a bit to offended, bro. Calm down.
---
Lol for why? Did it open anything interesting up for you? Like a cool quest chain?
---
You okay?
---
This is great RP
---
TBH, as a healer, you just heal the tank. If the DPS get aggro you should let them die. That's for 90% of the fights, as there are Boss fights with spread out damage later on.
---
I don't think there's fury prot pre raid bis, simply because you need pretty decent gear for that to be effective/playable. You should watch skarm on YouTube, he's very knowledgeable about fury prot
---
Doesn't it proc the same 30 min cd?
---
Pala question: 
---
Seal of Righteous rank 2 costs double the mana ( 40 instead of 20 ) but only adds a very small amount of damage. Isn't it better / more efficient to use rank 1 then?
---
You mean like the SM/ZF meta? Totally, everyone already had that figured out.
---
Tis an undead mon, not a voodoo brudda
---
Don't know what to tell you. MMOs are a reflection of real life, and you are gonna experience negative social interactions in both.
---
Agreed. Roll on items that pertain to what you do/are doing.
---
These respawn throughout the instance for anyone doing this quest. So if you finish, just run back through and collect them
---
There’s always douche bags on the internet because no one is personally accountable for what they do. That’s when their true character shows. Bad people.
---
What’s that used for?
---
Whoah spoilers!
---
cause it pisses children like you off :)
---
You should be doing princess mars runs for ring. It’s bis for tanking or dps
---
Depends on who’s opening.
---
Are you riding just minding your own business and suddenly a mage frost roots you and your pet it’s pretty much game over.
---
If you get to open on any of those classes at 41yd you just kite them and drain mana along the way. 
---
Hunter pvp is really about kiting your opponent.
---
Get exalted then post, honoured is nothing.
---
Is that Sir Daniel Fortesque?
---
No Sir, I don't like it. It doesnt look balanced. It has weird talents that dont fit the feel of enhancement. Includes a haste buff which is just insane, even single target Bloodlust is strong. Aftershock makes little sense, when I read it I was like oh, so you are trying to build a tank Enhancement tree like it was originally envisioned, except some of the talents completely go against this, Savage Weaponry, what?  
---
You changed Toughness to be the equivalent of two warrior prot talents, so that is clearly to strong.  
---
Elemental shields is just weird, so the Shaman has to juggle two different buffs with 5min and 10min durations? This is a wacky talent that is too powerful for a tier one. The only thing that comes to mind that gives a whole new spell at tier 1 is Nature's Grasp, giving you a self buff root spell that triggers on hit.  A Tier 1 that unlocks 4 different spells is over the top and unbalanced.
---
Primal Endurance like the Toughness does too much for one Talent. Not that it is necessarily strong but usually talents augment one thing.  
---
I think Armaments of the Storm is unbalanced as well. It is insanely strong.  
---
Also, why Aftershock and not just keep Stormstrike and build off of that?  
---
Flurry is interesting but the shock cost reduction is to high imo since Flurry is already good. Also, for the next three swings? So depending on weapon your shock reduction could last really long or really short? it should just be a flat cost reduction and the time in which it lasts increase per talent point like 2/4/6/8/10. So the reduction time is static to the talent and not wildly changing based on weapon speed and procs  
---
I do like the base idea of Ancestral knowledge, but considering that most Enhancement Shamans arent using gear with Int the amount is rather minute.  It would be interesting if Ancestral Knowledge was a deeper talent or lead to a deeper talent to help mana issues but wasnt something that others would use, cause in this tree Resto and Elemental get a huge amount of mileage out of that talent.
---
Yes, prep is considered a cooldown.
---
Wondering the same..
---
Lol nice binds xd
---
I'm a hunter and thinking about my level 60 pet skills. I am solo'ing and into beast mastery, so want a strong tanking pet. I'm thinking of the following 2 possible setups:
---
Claw/Dash: 50 tp
---
Stamina 9: 150 tp
---
Armor 8: 100 tp
---
Stamina 7: 100 tp
---
Armor 7: 75 tp
---
Resistance 2 (x5): 75 tp (60 all res)
---
I'm wondering if the 60 resistance will help a bit more against caster mobs than a little bit more armor/health, or that it is negligible and I should just focus on stam + armor.
---
Thanks!
---
Nope. Heartseeker.
---
If you play shadow, chances are high you are in for the PvP.
---
Shrooms are used for lesser invulnerability potions. They are among the most sought after items for PvP.
---
Even though the abundance will increase with DM:E, the demand will vastly surpass the availability once PvP ranking comes out.
---
I didnt know this prior to classic. Thanks. I almost reported it thinking it was a bug.
---
You have trinket and all your engineering items... like... if you lose because of a rogue opener as a hunter, you're bad.
---
I wish the community in general felt this way, everyone is a meta slave and it is annoying AF.
---
yeah..Blizzard really fucked them with weapons after BWL
---
You spelled alliance wrong
---
Nope. Discount on gryphons and repairs in the Hinterlands, and I think that's gonna be it
---
Honestly capturing and torturing the Forsaken is totally justified. 
---
Torturing and experimenting on prisoners has been the go-to tactic for the forsaken since vanilla. They been full blown evil since their inception.
---
If you enjoy playing a support role boomie can be amazing. 3% crit for top casters in raid and the ability to heal on intense fights.
---
It would be simpler to say, if you need an entire handicap rule to make your class relevant, you are *really* bad.
---
On the other hand: Crippling poison. 
---
See which one of these is more true?
---
If they're gouging then the only rational move is to undercut. Build a customer base with low prices and make your money by volume.
---
I quite agree. Sunrise in this area is really something else as well, viewed from the top of the bluffs, looking out over Mulgore.
---
Asmongold tanked Onyxia as fury prot with pre-raid bis and did fine
---
no, you can distract and/or position yourself in the back of your opponent before duel starts. However , giving a rogue a free sap, which means free cheap shots leading to a guaranteed evisceration is a bit much.
---
Still amazing for hunters even then.
---
Oh, sure. My point is more that by using the same methods as the forsaken, the obvious evil faction, the scarlet crusade is obviously evil as well.
---
What kind of boomie spams wrath? No wonder ppl complain about them being oomkins. Starfire is waaay better.
---
The Mage Spell Dampen magic is useful when I'm solo questing against spell casters. I have yet to ever seen any use for Amplify Magic. When would this spell ever be useful? I bought rank 1 but don't see why I should ever upgrade it as I've only used it for the casting animation which looks cool.
---
It's very skill based now that you start every fight with an Opener, yeah, I get you.
---
Lmao.
---
Im not going to argue with someone with clearly no knowledge of pvp. Have a good day
---
No, you have no arguments. People with arguments refute point by point. 
---
End of story, leave now for all I care.
---
I have boomie form and reflection...
---
I would love to see a reduction but know it will never happen
---
Not even there yet and I've had to do it for 2 or 3 quests.
---
You make no sense. If 9 people say you're not terminally ill, and 1 doctor says you are, who would you listen to?
---
I was under the impression that chain pulling the entire instance is 1 pull. Matter of perspective or not, doing it otherwise is stupid. I would need to be on my own.
---
Druid t1 is worse than prebis.
---
Tell me about how a tank holds aggro against 5 casters in the UBRS rooms without crippling the killspeed by having the DPS go limpdickspeed so he can tank a few halfassed. Have two warriors with plate tank whatever hits them is vastly better killspeed than to have a tank noob around trying to get aggro.
---
I bet he still regrets rolling Alliance.
---
It's okay for fights where there's no magical damage, to increase healer efficiency.  I dont know how many of those exist though.  Patchwerk maybe, in naxx.
---
I've made plenty of jokes and laughed without actually feeling happy.
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
I was always told it was 10 percent luck, 20 percent skill, 15 percent concentrated power of will
---
you just fucking kill them and heal thru it? Its trivial. 500+ Dps easy
---
Wow, ya’ll been playin a totally different game. I haven’t grouped with the same person more than than once ever, and I generally just quest by myself. I feel like a hermit. 🤔
---
Why do you care about any post? There are hundreds of posts a day, and zero are about you, so you may as well just leave if you can't stand posts about other peoples' experiences.
---
That is cute man, live me some crossfaction kindness once in a while, keep doing your thing
---
and yet they can't compete with other DPS
---
you can talk to him btw
---
right click his portrait and add his bnet name
---
Auto attack is my DPS
---
Is someone playing boomkin anyways? With full spelldmg gear? I would like to see logs if that.
---
He also pointed at his black kingsnake but I couldn't find kingsnakes.. then I did snakes and it said Swosh.
---
messin around one night and joined in some alliance rp with my horde pally. had so much fun I popped over to the other side, made a toon and chatted with my new frineds.  They were so nice ended up making a druid to join their all druid guild.
---
As a paladin, you wont be oom very often, at least not in my experience. Just use rank 2, and if you somehow find yourself running low on mana constantly then downrank
---
Probably dodged a bullet there
---
Not a loot tracker but titan panel has an addon for gold that tells you an average per session. You can vendor Stuff and kinda come up with a good average income from farm spots.
---
I know the possible downsides of loot council. But I played in serious guilds that cleared most, if not all, the raid content from vanilla up through wrath. Loot council works when the guild is being run by the right people with the right goals.
---
Peacemaker spear from Strat is better.
---
If you see video games as waste of time, in a more decent world would you hoard food and drinks until you fall to death or would that be a waste of time ?   
---
SO is the Video game maybe not a waste of time, but the ultimate goal to use your time?
---
/r/YouFellForItFool
---
Yeah!  Can we get back to circle jerk hating Asmongold, please?
---
Wow Exploration
---
Nice job.
---
Imagine the karma though!? Just find a witty title, take a picture of your screen with your phone, and send thanks out to everyone making this possible.
---
You'll be swimming in fake internet points in no time.
---
As a warrior: no
---
In parties while leveling they are always oom and their damage is fucking lame
---
First time I’ve seen someone do this grind before 60. Grats, just got exalted myself!
---
A mage? Wth lol.

What does the carapice do
---
You could, but it would take a loooong time
---
Nice to hear. Today logged on and ganked immediately... Long corpse run just logged off -.- sigh
---
And on the opposite side there’s so many healers that it’s so hard for me to farm either way!
---
Epic= all roll bruh
---
NTA- people who dont want to group while questing deserve the solo experience.
---
Depends. I rarely use immolate for end game content. 
---
It’s basically shadow bolt spam for raids (40 mans and not ubrs) and corruption (I am SM/Ruin).  I also put up a curse of elements or shadow. But for dungeon AOE and even raid AOE, I use rain of fire and hellfire. Those are fire damage. 
---
Immolate is something I would use if they allowed me multiple debuff slots in raids. But no raid is going to let me do that. For dungeons (including ubrs that is technically raid content), fire damage is much more important as rain of fire and hellfire are super common. I even sometimes immolate, but it’s rare and stuff dies too quick for me to spend time dropping multiple dots. 
---
As a warlock, you ideally want multiple sets. For example, crit is much more important in MC than ubrs. Why? In MC, I am spamming shadow bolts I have Ruin. So stacking crit is awesome as all my spells can crit. In ubrs, I am using more dots and not just shadow bolting. So having more damage gear is nice. For example, I swap on a 1% crit shoulder for raids but use a spell damage shoulder for dungeons. 
---
This same concept could apply to shadow damage. You could swap on shadow gear for range and use more generic magic damage gear outside it as shadow damage tends to be higher than just magic damage. But that takes a lot of gear swapping, and given my bags are filled with shards and other consumables, I don’t have the space for multiple gear sets. So I keep it simple and just carry one gear set with a few pieces I swap out as needed.

The next boat will be in quite a while, so it's worth it to give it a try every time.

Because people make mistakes and it costs them less time to fix it than manually typing up a reply that they can't.

But there's a complete Excel with talents, gear and spells to calculate dps on different types of opponents in different lengths of combat
---
Activate Windows you bum.
---
Lol, great job...
---
Look, I  also had a great guild and we had open discussions of who got to roll and it worked very well. However I'm not recommending this system to everyone because you really need a good chemistry in casual guilds or good discipline in hardcore guilds, otherwise it won't work. When we transferred to a bigger server in BC we also had to install DKP because of higher member turnover.
---
Have you also seen a rogue sprint jumping on the opposite departing lift in thousand needles?
---
Ah, okay, mr T1 geared warrior still dicking around in UBRS.
---
first thing I do when encountering a horde i bond well with is add them to bnet, how the hell do some of these go so long without adding eachother
---
Works only on pve servers tho.
---
What quest do I have to grind to get exalted with night elves?
---
Yeah the Alliance on our server were OBSESSED with the Hillsbrad Yeti cave. There were skulls patrolling 24 hours a day. I have no idea why Yeti defense was so important, but I just skipped that quest and left them to do their dark bidding. 🤷‍♀️
---
And that mage deserves to be put on blast
---
They're are shared ah in bb and tanaris
---
I had a hunter try to attack me while I was fighting a mob. I finished killing the mob, bubbled, walked right up to the hunters face and got two cast of holy light off before he even reacted. He started  keyboard turning as fast as he could but realized his back was to a tree and there was no where left to go. I almost started to feel bad the third time I killed him :(

I saw this one group doing angerforge and arena only , with hoj and some arena items on reserve. I think he spent 2 hours looking for a healer.
---
Disgusting show of friendship.
---
I was flying from Moonglade to Rut‘Theran and saw a Mage in Shatterspear village AoEing the poor party trolls there. Must have had enough of all the overfarmed spots. I couldn‘t get his name, would have loved to whisper him.
---
I do play a rogue so tell me more, they do 180 sometimes when you stun them.
---
My raid had to force a lvl 57 warr to take the t2 helm. He originally passed on it to go for t1 set bonus.
---
Cool...what now? Are you going to China to fight the communist government? Are you going to get rid of your clothes and other things that are made in China? Are you going to sell your house and or leave your apartment because most of the building materials come from China...probably what now?
---
I mean, again, that's Blizzard's fuck up.
---
Cyclone didn't even exist in vanilla
---
Thats dumb
---
Unless it's a guild already planning for AQ40+, there's plenty of hunters as they're still very strong in MC.
---
Not always. For example, Encrusted Tail Fins, an elite quest in STV. The drop rate is 100%. But having another person in the group means you get 1 tail fin every other mob. Heads of quest target, for example, are lootable by all. But not all quest items drop for everyone.
---
Ya'll sad people, just let them enjoy it, if it's really bothersome you can always filter post so you wont be seeing them...
---
OP shouldn't have rolled.  Unique is not the same as Unique Equip.  You couldn't even pick it up.
---
Most of us have children now, expect more grumpiness.
---
This. At qia this shit is common so its just best to report and move on
---
Sorry to change the subject, but what does one gain by buying a Maraudon run?
---
I really do hope so. We started on one server because guild we are part of wanted to go there. Well being in one of most populated servers is really pain when leveling up. If you want to do quests it just won't happen if you can't play early on morning (and of course I can't because of work). So you end up level up by grinding or running dungeons. It really has eaten some of my motivation to play. Also because there is still queues it means that if you want to do something else at night (go to gym, spend time with family) you have to accept that you are not going to play rest of that day because queue hits you.
---
Couple of our friends started on smaller server. It would be great if I could migrate my character there. Starting over sounds pretty rough as I am already 53.
---
I mean the reason why these things are cryptic are so they don’t get absurd on a wide scale. It’s basically a mechanic for the no life’s to get a wider advantage against regular folk. It sucks but I’d much rather layering being a hidden thing you have to work really hard to exploit than have people hopping around layers all around me.
---
I think it's just not there in the classic version. Might be something with the way the games files work in classic that WA can't access.
---
Watch yer beck 😉
---
Wait till phase 2 when the honor system is implemented. It goes from carebears to total war.
---
I just don't understand. Dungeon ranged weapons had 31dpa. MC quest weapon goes directly to 42dps. A huge increase. BWL is 45dps. Meh. AQ40 i believe 46-48 or so. Meh. Absolute shit scaling.
---
Leatrix Plus can show you class color on portrait I think
---
Yeah this is why my character starts with two a’s.
---
Given how insane stealth detection is in Classic, none of that isn't even necessary. If you're looking for a rogue, you'll be able to find it.
---
Check out the site sixty upgrades. Just found it and it’s amazing
---
I dropped the carapace too and currently trying to get the frayed abomination stitching that drops in Strat UD.
---
After 15 runs, I only seen 3 times the item. Do you now a trick to get them faster ? Is it a specific abomination that drop it ? I'm just unlucky ?
---
Leatrix Plus, Leatrix Maps, Bartender.  Makes life easier.
---
The ultimate goal for a video game is to have fun
---
If you derive fun from the experience of leveling up or getting stronger, more power to you. OP also gets his "fun" from exploring
---
I did easily over 200 runs of UBRS in Vanilla and never saw the Carapace drop. Tonight, on our second guild run ever, we got it. Good times.
---
oof, goes to show you I guess...
---
It's great for pvp though, with fat int/stam on every slot. Just as most classes T1.
---
Yes there were, they are seperate addons for some reason. Atlas loot and normal atlas.
---
What does OP rolling have to do with the mage rolling and winning? OP doesn't have it from what I can see, and if he did, wouldn't have been able to roll.
---
Great photo!
---
Kut
---
They have a chance to drop off of any abom in strat. I just ran from unforgiven to baron in the side entrance. It took me around 13 runs to get the 10 stitchings.
---
The Deadmines.
---
I mean, its not about what you plan, its just that there arent many hunters, but that might be an our server thing, but we rarely get more than 3 in our runs whereas,mages and priests for example are usually 6-9
---
Is it gold?
---
I bet it's gold.
---
Fucking typical.
---
That 6g vendor
---
Oh I agree with you and that is how I remember it too. I'm just saying to blizzard this is working as intended due to their dumb ass "reference client"....
---
Shits wack man QQ
---
When did they introduce being allowed to link crafting items to chat, that would show what you need to make the item.
---
Or that random quest in Duskwood that implies they're trying to turn the entire horde into undead.
---
You can do without them, but you're going to want one for your mages when the mages switch to Fire.
---
They’re pretty bad but battle res and innervate are so useful that some raids might take you if they can’t find any resto druids and get desperate.
---
What about "Your job is to stay at max distance, auto-attacking, and to cast Tranquilizing Shot at Magmadar"?
---
US Faerlina only.
---
I reserve first orb or all boe greens. Demand for a tank is high enough.
---
Real talk, if you are pugging and your current BiS drops, you roll need. It's that simple.
---
Possible
---
Well said.
---
I'm a good guy. Except for sometimes when I'm a total dick ;)
---
had one in scholo last night, always top of the dps in every fight but 0% mana after every pull
---
You’re missing the point. If I want a PvE and a PvP character, that PvP character still needs to raid to get gear so it will still be swapping specs a minimum of once per week.
---
In reality the audience of classic is older and has more rl responsibilities than vanilla and 3-4h gold grinding a week just to swap between PvP and PvE and back is really not possible for many.
---
I wouldn’t be opposed to the dual spec requiring you to go back to your class trainer to swap, just reduce the gold requirement.
---
Well i for one would join the  Scarlet Crusade  against the Forsaken if they asked.
---
And?
---
Troll mage with dreadmist helm.. yeah he’s garbage.
---
You miss your nap time bb gurl?
---
Our heal bomb, holy light, also heals enormous amounts. It's just not very mana efficient if we're forced to use it (unless you pop a 2m cooldown to auto crit and get a mana refund). The major downside to holy pallies is that we have no AoE healing and no HoTs. Just single target heals, but extremely mana efficient.
---
5/5 eye of divinity so far. Must suck to be a hunter in our guild.
---
You can grind rep for the goblin factions. Pirates in STV and the bandits in Tanaris.
---
Yeah thought so, think I tried this before.
---
Carapace is better for pvp
---
I use Bite when solo questing, so that there's always focus available for Growl, and Claw when in instances where Growl is disabled and I just want my pet doing as much damage as possible.
---
Just added this bot, fantastic idea! But, when I go to create an event, it DMs me but never actually posts the event in the discord. Is this a typical issue?
---
It's better to just have another mage than a boomkin
---
I second this opinion, personally don't like the lok'delar stats anyway, so I'll be rolling with Warmonger to hit the hit cap, pun intended.
---
Frostmane detected
---
I got that savage chest. Good to know
---
 Didn't plan on replacing it until I get some MC gear
---
What alchemy potions are soulbound?
---
Nooooo.....   I’ve run this so very many times...
---
&gt;which refunds 70% of a heals mana if it Crits.
---
100%.
---
I did it myself, does not work.  You still lose rep as a ghost.
---
My favourite:
---
"LFG Strat, mount reserved"
---
No idea. I could assume maybe because I never saw them anymore since but I have no way of keeping track of horde.
---
Boomkins have grown a great deal and improved since 2004. There dps today is incomparably higher and more than enough to meet the required dps to kill the boss. But it will demand effort to reach the typical average of pure dps classes in raids. There's an [off-meta discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/tZcjhsn) with guys in there making crazy game changing discoveries with boomkin and plenty of other classes. Helped me learned a few new things.
---
Do you have 99 rep or 129 rep into Revered?  Really interested in the answer.
---
What you have to think about is time vs gold. If your guild is spending 3 hours a night to clear MC or possibly longer 100g in consumables is not dumb if your cutting that down to 1 hour clear times considering you could then spend that 2 hours as a guild then farming gold / mats or dungeons to get guildies gear and be productive with your raid time
---
Just wait 3 days and farm jump runs.
---
Commenting for reference
---
&gt; They are among the most sought after items for PvP.
---
there isnt that much pvp now
---
Farm some rep. Max your hydraxian rep as much as you can then you can douse when your guild is at MC. Farm timbermaw rep in felwood, get that cool trinket and get plenty of the items to cleanse the plants as a bonus. Spam strat/scholo, you'll eventually want that argent dawn rep for later phases. Go farm the various items you need for thorium rep.
---
True, but that was without 1.12 classes.
---
Seems useful to put it on the tank in a lot of situations. Generally a substantial majority of tank damage is going to be physical. It's situational, of course, and you wouldn't want to use it during a fight in which the tank is getting heavy spell damage.
---
Generally damage meters will tell you how much of each kind of damage a character is taking, so you can look at that to get a sense of which fights it would be useful on.
---
Damage taken by healers and DPS will usually be mostly magical, since they shouldn't be taking direct hits, so using it on anyone but a tank would be highly situational.
---
Thanx mate. It was indeed bound to pet action 5 by default.
---
I have an imp named Kar'loz.  He's my little spicy jalapeno.
---
&gt; Running out of Mana doesn't matter when fights don't last 3+ minutes and everyone is drinking for 5 seconds between every pull because a mages are very popular and going to be in every group anyways.
---
We need more people like you spreading this basic info, its dumbfounding how many people complain about mana and put no effort to solve it. Most of them going off outdated info from 15 years ago...
---
And now Kiss!
---
If we could get to the point where more than two people one the internet were too good at spelling.  But that is too much to ask for. :P
---
Because of melee weaving, which is a thing. Otherwise bone hatchet and boneslicer dagger from strat would be as good as the polearm you mentioned. But this is pointless anyways as diremaul is almost here and that means that Barbarous blade would become The BiS
---
Everyone but the reserving player passes
---
How do I save vuhdo profiles if I switch computers?
---
Is Mana Channeling want going to be better than Bonecreeper stylus for priest pve healing?
---
&gt; Most top end guilds will run with one or two in raid max
---
Lol what a stupid thing to say. Most top end *elitist for zero reason* guilds will run with one or two raid max. Fixed that for you.
---
All of them.
---
Jokes aside literally every NE quest.
---
Priests, how do you make the leveling process more fun? I want to heal end-game but spamming Smite &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand can get a little monotonous, even if it's hyper efficient.
---
I say no- 'cause if you are, I am. Was about to kill Princess (the boar) and was waiting for a party member. I see a warrior charge in and die before I could get there. Warrior comes back, rezzes, I throw an invite and he declines. I shrug, he charges in and dies, again.
---
My party member arrives just as the warrior comes back. Warrior rezzes and charges in, again.  So, I throw an invite again, which he declines, again... and I watch him die, again.  Killed Princess, loot, leave.
---
I still feel a little bad about it.
---
Stam is your most important stat in pvp imo.
---
Even in you had a Guild raid why would anyone waste a slot for a shadow priest. They bacame usefull when the 16 debuff limit was removed and they could restore mana for a group. Before that i had never seen a sp in progress raids
---
Shure, i had only the early raids in mind.
---
n0cHaNgEs
---
How do you dance while moving? Or is that just clever editing?
---
They dont. You can have both of them active, but you don't actually get the agility from the greater agility elixir If mongoose is active. Check your character screen next time If you try it.
---
You ask in general chat if people have seen him
---
Gottem
---
&gt;There are in-game rewards for doing this.
---
what
---
I play Horde side so I’m not sure to be honest. I know Pali tanks can generate their own AoE threat, but I still think the Ravager would be better for tanking multiple mobs.
---
Were you playing a druid as well? Druids were much less likely to attack one another in Vanilla.
---
Ehhh needing something you can't use then selling it to the guy who can??? How is this different from mage needing on plate then ransoming the tank
---
Looks like the other roller is a shaman, so possibly rolling for a solo weapon to use with windfury for when he respecs? Still agreed as much preferred for the rogue or warrior.
---
Why?
---

---
Argent dawn food ftw.
---
Uhh you are doing something very very wrong if you are not consistently making 50+ gold.
---
First off, you only need a half assed set of Eagle gear to get ~3k hp and ~6k mana which is more than enough.
---
That pull you mention is not necessary as you should be doing &lt;12 min runs anyway doing 3 pulls + boss. Maybe you could throw in scarabs as well if you do bigger pulls but that means full bags very much faster, and that makes it not worth it. Not to mention the bigger the pull, the higher the risk of mobs resisting nova multiple times.
---
You seriously don't want almost any of your prebis while doing this. Crit is useless, and SP is almost useless. All you need is some greens from AH.
---
You will make 15-20g off raw silver drops alone. If you only make that then I don't know what to say.
---
Mate, don't try and act like you're somehow smarter for still playing. It's because you're not willing to inconvenience yourself in any way.
---
Oh that post again.
---
*pay for the repair bill
---
I have never dps'd a boss without MCP so hard to say, on trash however I use Fist of Omokk and still stay within 1-5 on the damage meters. Short fights are a lot easier to top though.
---
Here's our last Magmadar (done this wednesday), if you want to compare your own DPS as well as your guilds warriors/rogues:  
---
 [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/bgzRwZMn42LaphNy/#fight=2](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/bgzRwZMn42LaphNy/#fight=2) 
---
Reason I like looking at Magmadar is because it's the only boss you have the potential to put out maximum DPS without interruption.
---
We used mages back in the day. I was one of them. Usually respecced to frost for just this encounter an then back to fire again.
---
If i just wasn't burned out on dungeons that is. Probably done 15 runs at that point.
---
A few ways.
---
1. Trade chat
---
2. join /lookingforgroup
---
3. In the zone the dungeon is in. So for Wailing Caverns, look at Barrens chat
---
4. Bonus in the actual dungeon zone chat. So there are usually people hanging out in the Scarlet Monastery chat room looking for groups.
---
Righteous orbs are green drops from Live Stratholme, used in several of the best enchants in the game (Crusader and Healing Power), and a few crafted pieces.
---
Normally worth 60-80g a piece.  So some tanks will basically sell their services by reserving the first righteous orb that drops.  
---

I see thx
---
They are smuggling stuff back and forth in secret compartments inside. The whole transporting passengers thing is just a cover. They are dodging taxes and who knows what else.
---
When they say "gamblin', tinkerin', laundry" they aren't copying Jersey Shore. They mean laundering, like money laundering.
---
Looks awesome. Totally worth the effort.
---
These new mage retards need to learn sooner or later. Please let the mages face tank.

Crafting/enchantment reagent from Stratholme living side, usually 25g-30g worth
---
Righteous Orb
---
Also the AQ40 weapon is way too fast to be good for hunters.
---
True, yes I have recount to look at damage type, but it's also just paying attention. I guess they could just right click it off if we go up against a serious spellcaster that isn't cc'd. I barely ever see mages use this buff, I don't think I've ever seen it!
---
In 5 runs, you will get 15-20g from just cash drops. Grays, greens, and cloth make it a consistent 50g+/hour, and you can get lucky with epics/blues.
---
I have a bunch of shit going on constantly, having less things to keep track of is always a plus. 
---
That's the point of technology, to aid us, to make our lives easier. If there's a tool that tracks my lockout times then it's one less thing I have to think about. 
---
Can I track them myself manually? Of course, it's a simple thing, but would I prefer to have a computer track it for me automatically? Yes. 
---
I'm also playing down-to-the-wire lockouts here, like my runs are right around the 12-14 minute marks, so being off manually by even 1 or 2 minutes can result in a huge time loss if I end up getting locked out.
---
&gt; but barely scale with gear
---
Not really, they scale greatly with gear. Weapons late, late in the game change that only. You people taking the Naxxramas truth as the truth for the rest of the game are not realizing you're talking 1% of the game vs 99% of the rest.
---
Sigh. 3/3 leafs for me. *cries in priest*
---
Righteous Orb. Dropped by the scarlet humans in stratholme live side. Used for crusader enchant and some good pieces of gear.
---
Thought so too but I had it for sure in an older version...
---
Haopens oñ non debuff fights too
---
I have one but very rarely see anyone with it
---
Or you know, because you like playing hunter and you find it fun.
---
NO
---
Rhetorical question haha.

Glad to know someone else has the same issue. My policy if fewer, hard hitting mobs : full tank gear, def stance, do all that is possible to maintain agro. Many, less hard hitting mobs : full dps gear and bers stance, hope that healer can handle, and just sit back while i can uncleanch my butt and enjoy actually smacking stuff around.
---
they should be finishing all the map for classic, in the state of that timeline.
---
add new quest hubs but not improved gear to f*ck up the ballance.
---
maybe some new dungeons, tons of content that can be made on the missing part of the map
---
Maybe they ragedeleted and just leveled back up quickly.
---
Mages are the new hunters in classic.
---
You would be delusional if you think everyone here is an expert.
---
Unfortunately for OP, this is obviously something people want to see, otherwise the posts wouldn't get upvoted. Reddit is designed so the content that the most people want to see is at the top. If you don't like it, you have to start your own subreddit with its own rules.

Wow
---
&gt;If we could get to the point where more than two people one the internet were too good at spelling.  But that is too much to ask for. :P
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
and pet DOESNT scale at all except his level
---
Looks like hunter loot.
---
That guy filled his group within 5 minutes. You may laugh but you're still lfg tank.
---

One hour later...

---
Wanna know the same thing. Don't want to group with this guy.
---
He did.
---
&gt;The one item you have to loot, the whole group gets from one kill.
---
That's all industry is to anyone in control of anything in real life too.
---
I also love druids, almost more than my main, mage, because mages are so ubiquitous these days (even though half of them can't play correctly it seems...) anyway druids are all about versatility, so even a boomkin could change form and drop some heals or off tank in bear if needed in any situation. But as far as their comparison to mages, they really do pale, think of them as a caster support class. As a mage I love boomkins because of the crit aura and knowing a good boomkin is also watching out for spot heals if no one else is, not being afraid to change form to heal or bear Growl on the fly. A bad boomkin will try to compete on a dps chart which is senseless. 
---
I played druid for a long time in every spec back in the day. I found restoration was the way to go in most cases, unless you are specifically focused on bear tanking. But I always think it's fun to see a boomkin, it's charming. My druid on retail was eventually Boomkin before I stopped, that was a long time ago, but that was mostly just for shits and giggles.
---
Found salty hunter.
---
Really? I thought there were a lot of warriors or at least a lot of people said they were rolling warrior.  This is good news for me although I’m only level 27
---
My guild had gotten 6 leafs (2 raid teams) before a Eye of divitny finnaly dropped. And I got it!
---
lol stfu and just ignore them or dont join them headass
---
imagine a ubrs jed / rend run and the leader reserves truestrike. then everyone that doesnt need truestrike can join cus they need jed or rend. everybody wins here.
---
How much do you typically charge for an arcanite transmute cd?
---
So evil.
---
He couls have hone to a med/high pop lol
---
hunter in p1: 450. bis bwl: 550. full naxx: 650.
---
meanwhile warlock ( so not mage or warri) start p1 500. bwl 700. naxx  over 900
---
ouch I am 48 and haven't done an aweful lot of NE quests... Does that mean I don't even need to try catching up with all the grey quests?
---
Yep they’re about that on arugal
---
Did he show you his dwarven hand cannon? Did you yar Yar hump hump in the deeprun tram?
---
zombies give a lot of rep and drops
---
GMs aren't doing anything about it. They said before classic came out that they wouldn't be handling item tickets for this kind of thing.
---
If you think he will be spending those money or even having a normal life after defying the chinese government you dont understand how "democracy" works there. 😅
---
and in p1 there are better weapons for melee slot
---
To be fair, they sound generally clueless either way.
---

[This](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=02413825251575404009) small addon
---
that creates a key binding to toggle 'FPS' mode where mouse look is locked and mouse buttons and now bound to action bar buttons 1 and 2. I've kept it working/patched since cata for personal use and it's a must have when I'm leveling melee classes. Works for both classic and retail.
---
how do you strafe
---
Everyone deserves a fair shot at the loot.
---
Moral high horse spotted
---
They fucking don't.
---
Your stings don't scale with shit. Your traps don't scale with shit. Your pet doesn't scale with shit. Arcane Shot barely fucking scales with magic damage. Poorly.
---
Your only abilities that scale are Aimed Shot, Multi Shot, and Raptor Strike. And those only scale because of the weapons that you use. And guess what? Ranged weapons scale terribly too.
---
Vanilla patches deliberately nerfed their scaling and pets so you're getting about the worst possible version of hunter right now. Along with the extra leeway shenanigans and Scatter/Freezing sharing Diminishing Returns.
---
Nope
---
Horde has the advantage in 2H Fury being a viable DPS spec for warriors. So that’s an option with a 2H axe. 
---
Go for axes because of your racial. So if you go Fury, buy a Flurry Axe from AH and go to town with a slow Axe MH.
---
My guild has like 1+2 druid and 1-2 hunters in each raid and they are all super decked. You don't need to be on the loot council when you are a hunter/druid, no one else wants your loot
---
Mount is not the problem. Mount training is. Can’t ride a raptor with kodo-riding...
---
Do it in your guild discord so there's no text evidence.
---
What's that rep for?
---
The Holy Trinity
---
Yeah, noticed a lot of healers. Finding groups eventually but not as easily as I thought
---
Which is probably why he whispered FU lmao
---
it was the perfect wep for you. im sorry.
---
I heard he’s sex trafficking gnomes from booty bay to ratchet.
---
This sub is going to shit, seen it happen to several others.  We're just going to keep getting repeat content like this.  More and more folks who have actual content to post will get moderated / frustrated and leave, and this is all we'll be left with.
---
Comment was fine without your fix :)
---
No we all get it. It’s just fucking stupid.
---
They are just full of shit though. They push political messages all the time.
---
Its 350-400g im not that rich , what other options that i could farm
---
Well no, as PvE gear is no good for PvP :-)
---
It took me a while before i got it D:
---
Nice skirt Ork
---
what server is this?
---
that was the very start of vanilla. Not 1.12.
---
So no you will never see them.
---
Talk about a Romeo and Juliet saga!
---
I built a 4/5 guild run to lbrs with the sole intent of getting the gems.  We invited one other without specifying reservation, and so wasted 2 hours of our time.
---
Your Anderson to reservation is moronic.
---
I'm sorry but Briarwood is quite simple to farm.. People are just very bad at putting themselves in a favorable position. 
---
Find Jed ID
---
Make a 6-8. Man group
---
Invite 1 healer 
---
Make sure you are the only caster besides the healer ofc
---
Fill it with melees (they will spam you for rend invite) 
---
When the trinket drops you have a 50% chance of winning if the healer needs it. 
---
When it comes to "luck" based stuff, all you ever have to think of is how to up your percentages of winning. And that is NOT by joining a 20 man group with 15 casters that need the trinket.
---
Transferred there recently with my buddies. 
---
Population is smaller then what we were used to (Skeram) but once you get used to it, the server is quite lively. Always finding groups for dungeons and quests, constantly see people questing alongside me or going off in the opposite direction. The LFG channel moves quickly, but not so fast you can’t read it.
---
Faction balance seems to be a lot better now.
---
no you don't. i just gave a perfectly valid explanation for why it's not stupid.
---
Did they ever make it so that you can't need an item if your class can't use it? Seems like a perfectly sensible change to me
---
Shield does not sell for much. Got on in AH on my server for 18g. So if it is a loss at least it's not a huge one.
---
Hol' up
---
Just got to 49 and just got my mount.
---
I'll get there when i gory damn get there
---
This does not seem entirely legit, omokk has 2 big ogers standing in front of him, how come those had just disappeared?
---
Yeah, except they've gone and formed a cartel so there's no market worth preserving. Burn it all down, and enjoy the tears of people who imagined themselves more important than they were.
---
Dark pact needed for this I see? What spec were you?
---
Omg that was going to be my exact comment
---
"I need my epic mount and shards are money, everyone needs money"
---
\- That mage, probably. Fuck that mage.
---
Thanks. It isn't ideal sine you can't increase the size but it works for now I suppose.
---
I don't think people declining group invites are assholes. I also don't think people that die from pulling too many mobs are assholes.
---
If you spam Frostbolt in a DUNGEON you are doing it wrong, my guy.
---
Not mage unless you like 1 button + occasionally 3 others for aoe
---
What Item add-on is that?

---
how do you get to here  never heard of this one before. You can get under zul'gurub, hyjal, empty part south of stonetalon, empty place behind dire maul and also the temple on the desolace-thunder bluff flight path and my personal favorite the outlands test zone in deadmines
---
On my server it's usually 5g.
---
&gt;  it's just that they don't have in combat mana regen abilitie
---
What are you talking about? there's a 3 point talent in the resto tree for in combat mana regen.
---
Don't turn it in if you want free easy transport to Ironforge area.
---
As an affliction warlock about to hit Scarlet Monastery GY (level 30 atm). What should I understand about my role in spell cleave, or aoe centric runs in general?
---
Am I looking at rain of fire or hellfire more than likely?  (i would assume there is room for "depends on strength of tank/healer").  
---
Am I looking at summoning my void, and sacrificing it for a bubble- for hellfire?
---
okey
---
Using KUI nameplates for essentially the same reasons. I prefer their asthetic to Neatplates personally.
---
I know what it means just surpised at the insult, like how Americans can't converse without insults. Guess it makes sense if I follow the national voting. Cheers for you're time and reading my opinion.
---
Druids and hunters have gearing so easy.
---
So what is your point again? Because my point was that they treat animals badly. Especially during a festival where they cook dogs alive. At no point did i suggest that eating dog meat is worse than eating cow meat
---
Mage had no reason to roll,  but from what I am seeing why did the enhance shaman roll on it? There is no context where ironfoe would be good. Everyone is raging on the mage, but really only the mage and rogue should have needed on it.
---
There isn’t anything wrong. Apparently Reddit has very strict rules what you can reserve and what you can’t.The reality is that it’s a free market and if a tank wants to charge 100G per run he can bloody well do so. Doesn’t make him an asshole, although it makes him an idiot cause he’d make way more money by charging less.
---
2h fury is atm stronger atm in my opinion for horde. Just stay 2h
---
Probably not. I don't think blizzard wants to waste resources on ninja or even accidental needs which is why they have systems in retail that makes it impossible to ninja/get items on accident.
---
Later phases, recpies and entering nax
---
&gt; They do dmg but they’re always oom
---
Nope, going oom is an outdated notion pushed by people not willing to put in the effort to solve it. In fact, we're finding out ways to outright spend less time drinking and improve mana regen, this was posted on discord recently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0-17Sp62eI worth a watch imo
---
Yeah it's a well known farming spot for mages, sad thing you can only have 1 mage per alliance side farming so there still is alot of competition for the spot, unless you're on a less developped server
---
Yes it was well known by the end of classic
---
Link?
---
It would have been interesting to see a superfast weapon. To make use of the IAotH procs, which is a flurry for hunters but hunters can't maintain the buff with slow weapons, unlike warriors.
---
If it‘s firemaw then it‘s probably me
---
Hey Folks,
---
I'm messing around with this macro but I can't get it working. In short it's suppose to switch between Viper Sting and Serpent Sting depending on if the target is a warrior / Rogue or anything else. 
---
Any thoughts are greatly appreciated:
---
\\#showtooltip Stings
---
/run C=UnitClass("unit"); 
---
if (C=string.match("Warrior"))CastSpellByName("Serpent Sting"); 
---
if (C=string.match("Rogue")) CastSpellByName("Serpent Sting"); CastSpellByName("Viper Sting") end
---
/cast !Auto Shot
---
Faerlina , seven is Quinn’s guild who is a big streamer !
---
Nah. It's dumb for the reason I explained. This sub has a boner for elitism where only the top 1% is viable and the rest is trash; reality is different.
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
---
ONE mistake, damn you mobile! ONE mistake!
---
I just had this problem with a new sword I got, but I needed to equip it first and bind it to me before I was able to equip it with a macro. Hope that made sense.
---
After farming UBRS for 4 days without a Mainhand drop, these exact items dropped for us.
---
The run after the mainhand dropped again.
---
I farmed 22x Briarwood trinkets, 5x Truestrike, 5x Offhands.
---
Gtfo
---
&gt; Your only abilities that scale are Aimed Shot, Multi Shot
---
Luckily, you don't need other abilities. That's like saying rogues don't scale because gouge and kicks don't scale. That's how silly you sound.
---
Cool ! Thanks ! but i wanted the talant build thingie not just items haha
---
You're not answering anything I said.
---
Do not buy spells anymore if you want your mount asap
---
Johnny?
---
Johnny!?
---
JOHNNY!?!?!?!?!!!!!
---
"and once his capitalization costs have been covered" They are not if he is giving enchants away for free, time is money, he is not gaining back what he invested as time. 
---
"he’s not selling for below productions costs" Yes he is if he is selling for free. 
---
"They’re not “screwing over” anyone, especially not a fucking cartel."
---
Yes they are fuckin over normal enchanters, there is no fuckin cartel this is guy is hyperboling, where is the proof of this cartel activity? THe only thing the whispers shows are them asking why he is enchanting for free. I play on this server, do you?
---
the blackstone ring which is bis preraid for melees and hunters. some even use it for tanking

The elitist jerks are salty, not me. I'm happy, I'm clearing the same content as people jerking off on elitism are, without the shitty attitude and guild with it. We'll probably be late on world firsts by few weeks, and not always server firsts, but we'll do it and have fun.
---
You can do BRD AOE runs from 52, you clear all trash at the start and in the circle where the cells are
---
Doesn't matter.  Still worth it to join! You even have altaholics like me who keep populating the lower levels! XD
---
You underestimate the amount of people using fake BTs(the 1.2 as Cat that looks exactly the same).
---
Was going through Gnomer last night and someone got killed by the falling rocks
---
i'd join, give 0 fuck about the mount
---
Its not cutting into profits, its fuckin over every single enchanter on the server, people who dont know shit about this, normal people playing the game normally, people who NEVER were part of a guild thats sole purpose is to make profit. Remember OP was in the guild him self.
---
My point has been made clear. Discussion is not about how they are treated in the cooking process. The comment only mentioned that they eat dogs and that was the negative. Your point is completely irrelevant.
---
You’re at the right level, you can spam ZF GY to level 51, then quest to 52 and then back to dungeons with BRD from 52 to 56 then LBRS
---
Except tanks, tanks only take SOME of the rogue gear.
---
I think its the most balanced pvp realm last tkme we were able to record.
---
I just meant getting ganked by me :P
---
Also curious
---
Lol at all that
---
You playing horde or alliance? Going for horde :P
---
oh my  gad. swosh has ganked me så  many times in stv. flashbacks
---
Ah, female toon. He thinks he’s helping a chick. If he sees this you just ruined it for him, assuming you’re a dude. 99% probability that you are.
---
You can ask any inkeeeper for dungeons at your level range. They will guide you.
---
Thx bro
---
Swiftly used a multi boxer of boomies last night to run UBRS. Was pretty entertaining to watch a run.
---
I got convinced to roll tank because a bunch of friends and guildies told me that they needed a tank. I get into groups for dungeons easily, but usually deal with shitty groups that just want to pop off on dps (which is fine. It makes it more fun when it’s hard and helps speed up the dungeon, but nontheless I die sometimes and it costs me by far the most). There’s no fucking way that as a warrior I’m gonna make money farming gold in dungeons unless I get extraordinarily lucky in inefficient SFK runs. 
---
What do you want me to do besides reserve loot that nobody needs? I “need” (it’s preferable) engineering for tanking, blacksmithing as well preferably but mining for now. And even if I kept mining, it’s super inefficient on a pvp server where practically any other 60 alliance class is gonna shit on me in a 1v1 pvp match. I mean reserving EVERYTHING is excessive, but first orb/vendor trash/all greens is a small price to pay for some people.
---
I tried it but didnt work on standart ubit frames.
---
Do you have a link for working version?
---
It's time to shut up
---
Its not ridicilous, its called Hyperbole, i play on razorgore and everything on this thread is ridicilous hyperbole. I have never ever seen anybody ask 75g for a maraudon run, explain who could afford paying 75g for a shitty maraudon run?
---
I've been following this for awhile. Athene really has lost it.
---
We should be leaving a rotting trail of gore everywhere
---
Same thing on razorgore, this guy is hyperboling.
---
When do you see people reserving BOE purples or sell it to another in the group after winning? They are different than recipes, so this argument is also invalid
---
 r/cultist101
---
Typically as the lock you’ll be using eye of Kilrogg to pull large numbers of mobs in the dungeon, then using hellfire once the mobs are safely clumped up and frost nova’d / slowed from the mages.
---
They were a very notorious guild in the private server scene.
---
No way man that would mean social interaction beyond emotes and that is just too much
---
Are you a troll or just an idiot? Why would a mage need ironfoe? And why wouldn't an enhance sham want it??
---
Taking it one step at a time, eh?
---
Yeah you can, I jumped down and had to kill 1 orc pack and 2 troll packs but this skip is probably faster. However I killed every ogre from the start via kiting and didn't go up that ledge until I got to the 3 packs because it is faster.
---
Remember that arcane missiles continue even without los so you can just jump up and down that ledge to cast those over and over.
---
it's a macro that does nothing :) for fun only
---
I only heal people in my party so sorry
---
This is the complete wrong comparison. You don't compare a boomkin to a raw dps like a Warlock or deep frost Mage. The most apt comparison for a Boomie is with a Winter's Chill mage. Boomkins not only do more damage than WC mages but they bring far more utility than simply boosting dps of other mages. They have innervate and rebirth, as well as higher tankiness due to some leather (I know they wear a lot of cloth) and the boomie armor bonus. They also have the best dance in the game.
---
To be fair that’s fine.  Like the mount ain’t gonna drop, so if some feared dude wants to carry my alt in strat on the off chance - that’s fine.
---
What an interesting post. Everything is there, the NE priest choice, the mouseclicking, the overall stupid idea... 
---
And you guys wonder why blizzard doesn't tailor patch deployment dates to cater to the casual uh?
---
Help lower level people
---
Any way else for tanks to make gold? I get this is excessive, but with how fucking expensive gearing a warrior is I don’t see many alternatives (besides leveling an alt to farm with...)

F
---
Battle rez is highly overrated - it's better the worse a group is.  I didn't even use mine this week.  Also, there is ZERO chance a moonkin does comparable damage to a WC mage.  And if people are going to use the excuse that moonkin is good on these short MC fights, then innervate goes out the window too.  You don't really need innervate on anything before domo.
---
I mean it sucks but you can see why they don't allow it right? They'd be flooded with tickets for the same thing.
---
Those two halves add up to a full retard. Don't talk about seeds if you can't comprehend basic statistics. You can run BRD 200 times and not see it, anecdotal evidence proves absolutely nothing as regards drop rates by itself.
---
Same with druid. I know Esfand's guild has an 8/8 Druid in it as of like 2 weeks ago and I think Sodapoppin is at worst 6/8 and he got to that super quick. All you really need to worry about as those classes is getting the loot to drop, the rest tends to take care of itself.
---
Pretty solid in pvp
---
Bad in raids cos oomkin is real
---
That’s what you get for promoting violence &amp; riots. If you try to separate a country the country will fire back. Imagine people marching for Pro Hawaii independence here. Ridiculous
---
I just checked remulos and the current listings are 1100 and 1200.
---
 I mean ...... all these others glasses get amazing stuff but then us hunters wouldn’t get pre trapping? Like really? Shits whack and pandering to mongoloid melee
---
You cant do it for every dungeon, you have to know which ones you get can get away with. Scholo specifically drops a shitton of caster preBiS. Mages in particular are the ones shitting money left, right and center. What does the mage care if he loses 10g a Scholo run if the run is 20-30mins faster with a decked out warrior, so he can use these 30mins to farm 30-40g? 
---
It's all economics and mages do very well, paying the tank with coin or passing on items.
---
Did you camp him or just get lucky?
---
Thanks so much man, I'll try this out later on tonight. I hope I can still do it as an alliance!
---
That's hilarious

I think this is Gehennas EU.

Because you didn't have a question, you're coping for picking an undertuned class and pretending you're playing a warlock. Enjoy your tier now so you can do fresh 60 mage DPS in Naxx lmao

the twiligh highlands is east of grim batol so I guess he means that closed zone you can see on map which is pretty cool i never got into thaere

100% chance at getting BIS ring.
---
Copy the “WTF” folder inside your wow installation between computers. That contains all add on configuration (and graphics settings, iirc) so if you just want vuhdo you could try finding it’s individual setting file inside and copying that.
---
Regarding the wands, you need to look at your overall stat balance and see if you run out of mana more often than you find your heals not healing enough. Personally I’d go for the bonecreeper stylus for now, as most fights should be over within 3-5 minutes and your mana regen should not be too important. Maybe for fights like razorgore or nefarian, switch to more regen gear.
---
Watch out, you’ll have someone calling you “salty” with that logical attitude around here.

Been doing this as a Druid in lower level dungeons like SM and such ever since people on reddit here told me it's a legitimate tactic that doesn't get you blacklisted.
---
I get so many whispers whenever I log on to tank this (mostly) or heal that (sometimes) when I'm logging in to just try to solo some quests.  So, I throw out an offer and let the highest bidder have me.
---
I'm kind of like a high-end prostitute, it's fun.
---
Saaaame.  We've had 3/4 leafs but can't ever get sinews from Ony.  It's gonna be a while for my Rhok.
---
Old Twilight Highlands is just a bunch of mountains, I meant that specific area on the map.
---
As for getting there, I honestly forgot, but it took a lot of walljumping and trial and error.
---
As a lock I've had frozen wrath cape drop with no mage in group... goes to show rng random enchant drops suck
---
Well then at least you’re doing the lord’s work :p
---
And I am not claiming to be. I just dont think you're right because you have a majority.
---
warrior =/= tank
---
Lots of folks refuse to slap a shield on and tank. Even less have proper gear.
---
And 1% are raidtanks who have great gear and can sell runs for big money.
---
Still not as good as "the rake" in mulgore
---
&gt;Oh you're the guild that everybody hates,
---
This week lol
---
Plate means nothing for casters.
---
Well the Rogue outrolled him so he weouldn’t have gotten it either way but still, wtf.
---
Horde here. Attacked a few times. Also been mind controlled about 3 times. You’d think I would have learned my lesson the first two times but I was stupid. Now I hide in the cabin if I see a priest my level.
---
I mean, I can either reserver or I ask every single whisper if he needs Truestrike and if he does, I tell him, he can't come.   
---
Reserving just saves time and headaches for all people included.
---
Think you are just unlucky. You get on average 1 stich per run from just killing the abos before baron.
---
I mean, I can either reserver or I ask every single whisper if he needs Truestrike and if he does, I tell him, he can't come.Reserving just saves time and headaches for all people included.
---
The class fantasy and aesthetics are pretty cool but from a gameplay perspective all I feel it has is a lot of interactivity in pvp and some over encounters. Optimally for leveling you will use the same seal everytime and only judgement at the end of the buff or if necessary.
---
The class brings a lot to the table in terms of support but everything else about it leaves much to be desired
---
No because Warriors can use just about anything besides wands. That would just mean Warriors make better ninjas 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Can't wait for it to be ruined by idiotic spectators.
---
Thing is that healers need nothing rly from those bosses, except maybe the legs from Angerforge. So for a healer to be running that is mainly to help players from the guild or friends.
---
Weapon skills make a huge difference for glancing blows, which will occur for mobs either 3 levels above (e.g. 63 when you’re 60) or boss mobs whose level is hidden. IIRC extra weapon skill will reduce the damage penalty, but not the rate of occurrence, of glancing blows. This makes an extra huge difference for warriors, where the reduced damage done also means less rage generated.
---
I never asked a question indeed. I am affirming something. 
---
Pretending the game starts and ends at Naxxramas is retarded. Naxxramas is the last part of the raiding content. It's not even the main part of raising content. WoW classic is not even limited at raiding.
---
Yet you act like literally the game is Naxxramas and nothing else. You also try to pretend I would be coping... what for? I picked hunter because I enjoy the class. I have played them all during vanilla, if I wanted to pick my class to please elitist jerks, I would have done so.
---
I can't believe the lvl 60s don't still wanna spam gy/arms

The Alliance itself doesn't care. Stormwind even houses a few diplomatic emissaries from the Crusade, if I recall correctly. One of the two Scarlet Monestary quests on Alliance side are given to you by an ex-scarlet who's unhappy with the way the crusade turned out. Quote:
---
&gt;I once served the Scarlet Crusade with honor, loyalty and pride. I believed their cause to be a noble one: to rid Azeroth of the undead.
---
&gt;But as I spent time at the Monastery in Tirisfal Glades I realized that their grasp on reality was slipping. They now think everyone is plagued who doesn't wear the tabard of the Crusade. Innocent men and women were tortured because they were supposedly plagued.
---
&gt;The Scarlet Crusade must be crushed in the name of the Light. You, &lt;name&gt;, must destroy the deranged regime.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1053/in-the-name-of-the-light
---
And the other quest is by a dwarven librarian who just sends you there to acquire a book she needs. Both times not exactly official Alliance business, just a bunch of adventurers heading in there.
---
And in the Plaguelands most if not all quests centered around the Crusade are given to you by members of the Argent Dawn, I'm fairly certain, who are a neutral organisation.
---
Used to craft BIS tanking plate chest.
---
The looks make up for that 0.1 attack speed difference xD
---
&gt; why is this triggering people?
---
Because your need for approval for doing mundane things is pitiful.
---
I've been checking the spot for like 2 days (while leveling)
---
You don't understand, if it's not a DPS increase it doesn't exist!
---
So an addon which buys runecloth AUTOMATICALLY...? Thats botting, ye
---
Jfc
---
And why would I do that? I rather invite people who don't need the items I do. 
---
I'm a tank, therefore for every LFM I post I have 10-15 melees spamming me. 
---
Would a mage farm 15gold an hour instead of 80g? Why wouldn't I use my leverage as tank to gear myself? Every class has its perks. The tank's perk is to be able to invite the people he likes to have in his group.
---
reserving items is ridiculous. the only "excuse" people ever have is "oh i have to set up the group and i dont want to run the dungeon again" 
---
isnt running dungeons supposed to be fun? its one of the main selling points of being level 60, like do you just want to gear up in one run of each dungeon then afk in town/raidlog?? i really dont understand why people are so afraid of rolling against someone else, its part of the fun of the game

How do these posts still get upvotes dear lord theres 3 screens each day here of him dropping both blades

I have atlas loot and dungeons maps don’t show up. Interference between add ons?

Just a quick question, I rushed my lvl on druid and got to lvl 37. I did the gnomeregan solo but now I can't use it?

I wish to know as well, my father use to be in a guild called Grumpy Old Farts back in Vanilla - TBC
---
How about you just don’t join their group? Nobody is forcing you to join a run where something is reserved. I actually think that you’re the one feeling entitled when you wanna force people to run without reservations.
---
/u/Vexor359, do you like movies about gladiators?
---
Cannot wait for more quality commentating from our boy! “Let’s see if he uses will of the forsaken to get out of this polymorph!”
---
- Stormwind and Orgrimmar are pretty popular so you can look 'em up on Youtube.
---
- I can't remember old Twilight unfortunately, but it was possible.
---
- For Tirisfal, there's a specific jump along the coast next to the area where you need to get stuck, then just walljump up.
---
- For Old Gilneas, you have to swim from Hillsbrad, get on coast of Gilneas, then find a spot where you can climb in.
---
- For Quel'Thalas, you have to follow the river up, pass by Tirion's old house, then just climb up the waterfall.
---
- Redridge is fairly simple. Go up to the gnoll cave with the level 27-30 gnolls, climb on top of the entrance, then walljump on a slope to the right of the entrance.
---
Now these are just from memory, so I could be wrong on some.
---
I’m sure you just convinced everyone with your post.
---
And fyi, this have been a thing in vanilla, and on private servers.
---
It's because unsubbing from blizzard content will have absolutely 0 meaningful impact.
---
You could theoretically get band of accuria, but then the main tank would be pissed cD
---
It's not about joining them, it's about them flooding the chat. Them restricting groups from forming because some self-indulgent thought process that Only THEY should get the opportunity to roll for something. Only THEY should get the drop because THEY want it. Like just run and get the drop, and if you lose the roll then so be it go again and try some more. Shit happens. I literally saw a group forming for Strat UD with the mount on reserve should it drop. I don't know who would be dumb enough to join that, but eventually the leader was in strat and apparently someone was. Such entitlement is ridiculous and shouldn't be the mind-set if the game gathers more and more players that should be considered acceptable.
---
not wanting to waste time is bad?
---
You are digging your grave deeper and deeper. What hunter would want crappy 1handers over a phat 2hander he can swing once and disengage? 
---
Survival hunter PvP is a myth, my guy.
---
TSM can be setup to do some interesting stuff. It’s work to set it up though. Might cover what you want
---
Great song. ID?
---
Our guild boomkin has a Staff of Dominance. :P
---
Undead rogue here, just made it to STV and in my defense, I was stealthed and that dwarf pulled my mob and tagged it, plus he was 31 and I was only 30
---
Why do you care? if people want to be more efficient with their group formation I think thats smart of them. 
---
You can play casually and get loot haphazardly, and they can be efficient with their time and leverage their status to get it faster, there is no wrong way to play.
---
Is your character name Rick?
---
What does that mean?
---
If running dungeons to get loot is a waste of time, why play to begin with?

Thanks I'll look into it 😄

Just gotta say that I'm loving all this mage hate. I've hated mages since 2007. Welcome to the bandwagon boys.
---
Mages can't see two mobs stand within pissing distance of each other without spamming blizzard. They all seem so...dumb.
---
It would if enough people did.
---
I did something similar to that in Wrath when dungeon finder came out. I’d pay for that run: guaranteed quest completions, etc etc.
---
Because chasing a 4% drop while competing against 3-4 other people is pretty aids?
---
I've only ever played classic but I think that it doesn't matter.
---
as right as you are quinns guild is alliance and its SEVEN all capital letters as this guild is lowercase and horde. Just thought I should point that out
---
I don't either. I had 2 characters hit 40 within two days of each other and both got their mounts right then. I wasn't even saving that hard.
---
mad cus you rolled a badly scaling hunter LUL
---
I'm not havin' a conversation with you mate. I asked a legitimate question: What server are you on? I want to camp your corpse so you and all the other little racketeering pukes who think this behavior is okay get the message that abusing the system gets you killed over, and over, and over.
---
Also any reasonable guild will just dump gear on tanks in the beginning because otherwise no one is gonna have good time.
---
How did you coordinate an AH trade without language??
---
epic mounts are pretty important for battlegrounds, so it depends on if you think you can farm it before phase 3 imo
---
Your ui makes me sick, sry bro :(
---
Nah go back to retail
---
I remember this being a rumor back in retail, but it's not the case. Everything is affected by the modifier. And it makes sense if you think about it. If Frost spells got the full benefit of +frost damage, then things like coc and nova could be ridiculously overpowered.
---
Can't wait for that alliance rogue Ambush mid duel.
---
People who need on items in order to sell them are assholes yes
---
But enough people won't. I get what your saying. "well thats the problem! people thinking like you!" Me unsubbing isn't going to convince anyone else to unsub. Unfortunately we live in reality.
---
I like to go in and roll on the stuff they have reserved it is hilarious
---
because you want the loot?
---

There you go fellow warlock.
---
What a disgrace.
---
The point i didnt get from op, like Retail has personal loot and you dont need to reserve 🤷‍♂️
---
can you dm me how to duo this? never did this altho i was a rogue in vanilla lol.
---
 I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk, and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right!
---
Broken tooth leagues better
---
"top end guilds"
---
the content is perfectly clear able with a few hunters, my guild ran with 5-6 hunters from MC to naxx. you still do good dps and will out dps any meme spec. people overestimate the meta in vanilla, i would bring people who show up to raids consistently with consumes, and are knowledgeable about the fights over a bit of extra dps every time
---
Probably Guild-Leader and puts all other Hunters on Reserve.
---
It's kind of sad how major corporations can think so lowly of their player base that they can throw these sad attempts at damage control and think it'll be effective.
---
Honestly tho being that geared right now would be so boring!
---
I NEED A TRINKET OKAY? I'M DESPERATE
---
If the person makes the group and you join the loot is reserved period.  You don’t have to join the group.
---
How do you manage to talk to the opposite faction?
---
V true. It really depends what the tanks ok with.
---
This guy wins.  No more posts until a four-way tie.
---
Did you suffer brain damage at some point?
---
what dead fuckin server are you on? 1300g? literally 100x the price as on whitemane and herod
---
Never heard of her*
---
A-fucking-men!
---
Was that in lfg Chanel? Could have just been looking for a group while questing
---
It would be nice if on either this or retail, if you could choose servers where you could communicate and work with the opposing faction.
---
This traitor will be hanged in the orgrimmars courtyard for everyone to see
---
Hitting 60 by killing baron and having the mount drop.. And you snatch it with a 100 roll? :P
---
But how did he communicate which pet it was? Or was it the only auction listed?
---
Yea it's nice I can afford the rest of my class skills now too
---
Is he still needing on things tho ? :)
---
It all is actually a good hunter loot. At least carapace gives insane agility legs
---
I'm on mobile, it's in the warlock discord! I'll get it in a few hours
---
LO. HOWAREYEH?   
---
It's "Watch yer Beck's". You know how the little bastards love their ale.
---
/u/feargasm here it is
---
I think ur math here is faulty, the boomkin only raises the dps of the group by 3%. (you can't add them individually unless you wanted to compare it to a basis of 100% of a mage)
---
It scares me that they're learning to speak. It's only a matter of time now before they learn to *play*.
---
People don't get how hard it is to make money as a tank. Reserving trash loot as one's pretty fair in my book and one of the less intrusive things to do, same with reserving orbs, which rarely drop in the first place.
---
An average dungeon costs like a gold in repair if you never die at all, which is rare with randoms. I for one just never do dungeons outside of full guild/friend runs anyway, thus I don't charge anything but I absolutely get why especially geared &amp; skilled tanks do that.
---
Had a warlock take a painweaver band in UBRS yesterday. Was a guild run with 2 pugs. Was the only item our rogue needed and one of the few upgrades I needed.
---
Pretty gutted. I messaged his GM who replied “maybe it was an upgrade for him, even if the AP is useless he still gets the crit”. I explained crit =/= spell crit. He still didn’t care. Can’t wait for the shit show of rolls when they go to MC lol.
---
Unless you're a druid. Mara Ghost Mushroom farming for ~50g/h. Princess for 30-50g/h. The later ofc in a feral/resto build but I've seen druids on discord bragging they can do it in pure feral too.
---
Its the best trinket for a long time , the BWL trinket is just so rare and there will be 25 ppl on it
---
20 ap and the 2% proc as a rogue with SnD up all the time is a huge boost and its the only decent trinket if you are alliance
---
I never told them anything. In fact, I am far more on this side of the WoW player spectrum than anything; I farm my mats, potions, have a pure raiding spec that handicaps me anytime I am in a PvP situation, and I am constantly navigating the top 5 positions on bosses kills. Just because I am not the most radical radicalist doesn't mean I am not a radical. Here we have people literally condescending anyone not being as radical as them. This is shitty to no end, especially when they hide behind excuses such as "but-but in Naxxramas!!!"
---
Have you heard of the high elves ?
---
Waiting in stealth for someone else to do the work, 3 sec skinning, then vanishing must have been a great experience. If you're competing for resources try hunting for devilsaurs yourself. Pathetic.
---
Lmao. Cool projecting. You wish that to be true, so that you could get some ah-ah moment, but you have nothing to base it on.
---
Haha, you're pathetic dude. I am happier than I ever was even in vanilla.
---
What do you mean, that was a truth serum.
---
Yes she is harder on Retail because you cant Tank Princess with your pet you have to kite her.
---
Even then you can just use mana pots and runes to basicly never run out of mana on any class in the game that uses mana.
---
make own grp then, with your rules, jesus you people are just entitled idiots
---
Just let the mage aoe them in a quarter of the time?
---
It shows who posted it
---
Warlocks can solo maraudon and earn 30-50g per hour.
---
but sure, tanks have it easy...
---
I refuse to join groups like that. Honestly, you just need a good guild and stop grouping with pugs.
---
Here's the thing with normally socialized adults: they can discuss if/when we reach out phases where we need to be harsher on the optimization of our players, we will talk about it and adapt. I'm not sure who told you that we were "casual leveling", but it seems like you would categorize as such any guild that isn't fighting for world firsts; fact is that this is some arbitrary and rather stupid view of guilds.
---
Reality is that you are not clearing more than me, despite all your sacrifices. And that makes you feel terrible, that despite not playing what you would like, you are not getting more than me. Attacking me is a natural way to make yourself feel superior and therefore better; you are being pretty transparent.
---
The faster you accept that filthy casuals are having 100% the same as you are, and that your arbitrary notions on what is acceptable to raid are invalid, the sooner you will feel better about the situation.
---
Tanks do not need items in there, so consider it a service. Easy to steer away from these runs if you know a tank.
---
wf doesnt work with ironfoe. otherwise it would actually be a great pvp weapon vs melee
---

---
This is objectively wrong because reddit is superior to every other online forum. Out of one simple reason: You actually can clearly see who replied to who and don‘t have to go from a page to page to see replies or use any quotes.
---
Who could have guessed that a banshee queen was a bad leader?
---
Hahaha, more projecting. You're the one with the frantic attacking.
---
Pussies :)
---
Broken Tooth may be better, but damn if Humar isn't the best-looking cat in the game! If I had to have a cat, it would only be Humar... maaaaybe Echeyakee at a push. Never Broken Tooth; cannot stand that cat model. I still wish Lupos was still unique like Broken Tooth, though. Would've been all over that.

Everyone saying it's easy or crying being bitter.

No one giving the guy props for running scholo for others benefit when horrendously over geared.

That's a different things, lot rules were started on chat by him (group leader) and then he didn't respect them
---
Which eu server ?

I  am on nethergarde keep alliance . I am in an active guild (approx 500 people) and chat is active regardless of time of day.

I remember a sick orc hunter named gurtash on karanos 3. Dude was a legit hunter and we went around stv for a bit fucking ppl up. Funny to see this lol.
---
I have a level 30 warrior and get some PMs for tanking lower dungeons, i like this idea might give it a shot. Would help especially for gold towards mount!
---
sure, keep your delusional world view, with all the facts stacked against you. enjoy the guild breaker bosses, sounds like they're built for your group.
---
Can we try and nib this attitude in the bud? This whole 'Back to Retail' rhetoric just puts you in league with those you vehemently dislike.
---
i have a friend in alliance too we killed eachother from lvl 30 to 60
---
everytime we see eachother we dont hesitate one second to express our love with our fist and daggers
---
In EU there are a lot of people who struggle with English which is fine, but there are also a lot of people who spam chat channels with non server langauges which is annoying.
---
Banana curry pizza is the bomb
---
Echeyakee only has a 2.0 attack speed, there's much better cats than that everywhere. If you want a rare cat with a good look Humar is definitely the go-to cat.
---
Does bear form have in built extra threat?
---
A lot of people in EU live off the Govt and can provide for themselves so they go hard af imo.
---
That's why it's best to join a good guild that works together.
---
According to this sub, the item is 6g30s to vendor which for some might be decent money, and as people here preach, everyone should need since that money can help others afford their upgrades. :) I don't see anything wrong with it :)
---
where you standing within the range of both totems?
---
I know. It's why I did the whole 'maaaaaaybe' thing. It'd mostly be a stopgap until Humar.
---
I'm not 100% sure how it works but I'll try. 
---
So Vanilla back in the day was pretty laggy, and in order to replicate that, Blizzard added something called 'Spell batching'. Essentially, rather than spells being registered instantly like they are on retail, they're registered in batches every couple of seconds. Which is why sometimes itll feel like a heal or a bubble will go off in time but because its registered in the same batch as a killing blow, you'll still die. 
---
May wanna Google this yourself as like I said I'm not 100% sure how it works.
---
You should get out of durotar with level 12 if you completed all quests. At that Point there's a quest that sends you from razor hill to the barrens, where the early quests have you kill level 10-13 mobs.
---
Server?
---
Hol up
---
Truth be told, when I see a bazillion stacks of one for super cheap, and I need a lot, I will intentionally go out of my way to go past them all to just buy bulk, even if it costs a bit more. Fuck all the auction house bloat, man.
---
Wtf is wrong with you autists? I can't begin to imagine what you guys are like in real life. Why am I seeing so many lately. It's cringe worthy

You should have done more research my friend. With the current loot tables they are NOT bis for hunters.

They're actually even worse on shorter fights because they have no cooldowns like most of the top tier DPS classes like Warriors, Rogues and Mages. When encounters are that short then cooldowns become incredibly strong because they last for a larger percentage of combat.

You're literally talking about yourself. Guild breaking are guilds that are built on weak grounds; such as expecting people to sacrifice themselves as a cost for being in the guild. You are not able to talk about a single fact, while I have laid out multiple that you ignored. Let me state them again:
---
- Naxxramas is not the entirety of Raiding
---
- Raiding is not the entirety of PvE
---
- PvE is not the entirety of WoW
---
- Guilds that are refusing to arm-twist their players into the most extreme elitism are clearing the same exact content as you are.
---
These are all hard facts. They all shatter your ridiculous and arbitrary notion that literally every choices made on 27 August 2019 need to be made to clear Naxxramas in late 2020, or even 2021, and that not doing so is being a "pleb".
---
And this makes you feel terrible because the simple truth that you are doing all this not nothing is inconvenient.
---
This has always been my experience tbh. With any guild, in any version of the game; Classic, Wrath, Cata, etc. Advertise as a social guild, and it's mostly silence. Try to spark a convo and you get no response or a closed-ended one. There are those rare moments where there is convo, but definitely in the minority.
---
Yawn. If this was real classic you’d be done. Red is dead. FTH!
---
Wow such a hero
---
Maybe you’ll get it along with Classic + that people have been asking for.
---
Wut? How? Im a lock and have never heard of this but it sounds amazing
---
Grounding absorbs ”harmful” spells, guess poly is not considered harmful since it does no dmg to you.
---
You're not really making a good case for the Scarlet Crusade not being evil by saying their methods are the same as the Forsaken.
---
Good point! I wonder how many QoL updates they’ll add.
---
Anyone planning to reroll today or early next week? Looking for an active player even on weekdays, Ashbringer Horde side possibly, but not necessarily set on it.
---
So the creators of World of Warcraft should be at fault for this? I dont get your point at all. Do you know how big of a company Blizzard is?

The game has nothing with was was said/done by a group of people.

Okay so this mage is a friend of mine and I asked him what happened cause I saw this on both the Arugal subreddit and here. 
---
Hes one of the nicest people I met while levelling, and he would never intentionally ninja. Most people on OCE are cunts but he is not one of them. From what he told me, he didn't realise it wasn't a BOE, told the group to all roll need and hit need himself (which is common at least on our server). He told me he and the rogue are cool, and hes put in a ticket with blizzard to hopefully sort it out. Whether or not it does get sorted out I don't know, but thought i'd just put that out there there before everyone throws their pitchforks in.

huh, i thought you could "weave" slams in between autoattacks, much like hunters can with steady shot etc. thanks for the correction!
---
You would have been better off staying shifted in Vanilla raiding unless you were in a raid that didn't have any resto druids. A person could only have one rejuv on them until just before BC when they released the new talent trees and increased the number of hots and dots.
---
But he doesn't have a job IRL.
---
Does you mother still hang around in dockside bars?
---
As a tank you wear plate all the time sav glad is the only acception and some fire ress gear items for geddon and rag.
---
As a dps its a mixed bag of mostly leather with some mail and plate.
---
What’s the problem?
---
Saw it drop on my second UBRS run for classic. Everyone in my group need rolled on it. Including mages, rogues, priests etc...
---
wtf
---
Oh your well in the shit now m8

---
This is so wrong lol
---
Seriously for 6g you're gonna fuck someone over like that? Smh
---
Damn. That’s pretty lame.
---
Depends on what you're fighting. 
---
If it's fearable, well then you've basically won. Fear -&gt; Dots -&gt; Fear -&gt; Dots ad infinitum.
---
If it's not fearable, you've still got some options. If the mobs is relatively weak, you might get away with sacc'ing a blueberry and drain tanking it. Health stones and pots are obviously handy here. 
---
If the mob is banishable, ie a demon or elemental, then you're in luck - you can dot up, maybe get lucky with a nightfall proc and last as long as possible before banishing. You can then bandage up, life tap away, summon a new VW for sac etc before again doing some damage and banishing again. This is obviously slow and cumbersome, but you can solo some pretty crazy stuff with this tactic. 
---
Hope it helps!
---
Nuke the ranged mob and reset to aoe the other mobs
---
Paraphrasing the wowhead comments section, the XL cables have a higher chance or work, than the normal.
---
See the phrase "trueish",
---
That being said, I feel you man.
---
yeah its pretty fair imo. gear player is running a dungeon and doesnt need anything and ur carrying players who need stuff. u get the drops in return.
---
Nah, the war hasn't gone hot yet. You have the choice of who you want dead.
---
If you wanna flex your epix in a dungeon and somehow manage to wipe more than twice you are not worthy of payment anyways, i just stick with my blue dungeon set and i make a decent amount of money by running dungeons without payment.
---
We had a hunter roll need on a Felstriker last night. Thankfully he didn't win.
---
They cant even equipp it.
---
For Prot warri its Amazing.
---
For shaman its utter bullshit.
---
For rogue its not really worth it.
---
So in all you can say the whole group bend over the warrior and the mage got the moneyshot.
---
Would i have been the warrior doing a dungeon with guildies and that would happen, i would do less Guild runs for the Next Time.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
I can tell you right now, from experience, that it won't get sorted.
---
That mage (and the shaman, by extension) are absolute twats.
---
damn. so the top mage would get this right?
---
Our guild usually has 30-70 members online, and it's decently active, too active and It's just annoying tbh.
---
But theres always a few people down to talk
---
atiesh? damn, can't wait
---
I don't think that's true. When Census still worked, I periodically checked population. Even on level 60, even in early days warriors were most played class. On every other level that was true too. I was surprised as I thought that there will only be hunters and mages at level 60 for a white, but warriors were prevalent and there were a lot of priests as well.
---
Just little experiment: bracket 55-59. There are 46 rogues, 45 warriors, 35 mages, 33 paladins, 31 hunter, 28 rogues, 27 priests, 18 druids on my server right now.
---
Now druid is a rare commodity indeed!
---
what about atiesh? and what about something for mages?

---

---
WoW classic was a lot of fun for me, and finally being in a position in life where I had some free time to play was awesome. I was even looking forward to a return to retail and buying some of the cool store mounts, but the press releases / tweets Blizz sent out really made me think that they view their audience as a bunch of gibbering idiots. "We will defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost." Seriously? Fuck that noise and fook kneelers.
---
Imagine being this entitled... YOU can save ME time and money... DO IT ASSHOLE
---
I think in Need before Greed you can only Need what you can actually wear. Though I'm not sure how it works in classic. Like later on I think warriors couldn't need on cloth but I'm not sure whether that was the case in classic.
---
Guys, I'm not mad, and noone stole my devilsaur leather fortunately. I just don't think playing on a PvP server is a license to grief or be a complete dick to other players. I don't think most of you use this RP aspect of the game to any other means, other than justifiing how you ruin other people's fun or accomplisments. Or you'd never do this to your own faction? Yeah, right. I've seen countless players stealing nodes, treasure chests, ninjaing boe epics in dungeons, etc. There are people, to whom their own personal gain is more important, than integrity, and they try to justify their dick moves by saying "it's a pvp server so STFU". Playing on whatever server, you're a just a dick, stealing others' stuff. Have a nice day!

I feel like pets are too tanky. While leveling a Succubus has like half the hp of the warlock. It should be possible to basically oneshot them at 60 in raid gear, otherwise it's just completely broken.
---
Does that work with the stun and aoe stun abilities princess has?
---
oh look, another virtue signaling post
---
Ah ok, gotcha.
---
Lol at 2 months being a long time to hit 60.

Literally clicked on this post to shame you for virtue signaling but was beaten to it. Darn tootin!

Yeah, Ironfoe does not proc windfury.

Good riddance

How?
---
Grounding totem doesn't absorb dots, poly effects and whatnot.
---
It's not that big of a deal with wands as it is with spells, and then again - that"s why you use shield in your solo rotation
---
Absolutely not. Given equal gear lock has so much at their disposal to deal with a rogue. You cannot 100&gt;0 a good lock and he can either play succubus charm or void walker sack.

Weird never expierienced that on the german server lucifron there are many free enchants for faster skilling. More community thinking no just me or just my guild. Sometimes i think english or american servers have more selfish rpg unexperienced assholes than any other language specific server. I mean you are one server on faction you should act like that more like beeing one Team! So glad i play on german server!^^
---
no, u wanna get his corpse to cover the mailbox!
---
Yeah he could, I’ve seen it work out twice while leveling. People accidentally needed items they couldn’t use and got them transferred to the correct person via gm ticket.
---
Nobody has mentioned this yet but plate armor isn't available until level 40. Before 40, the toughest armor available is mail.
---
I think it’s not about the eye. It’s about the mats (50 arcanite bars, sulfuron ingots etc)
---
A boomie in proper arcane wrath gear will nearly have +600 arcane damage and fully raid buffed around 27%~ crit. In MC/BWL boomie is actually comparable to the other caster dps classes its just when AQ40 comes around and hit gesr is there the other caster classes talents scale A LOT bettrer than boomies which is where they fall off cos boomkins spell co effiency is insane. Starfire has a 100% scaling, wrath 54?%, moonfore 55%ish. Its just the talents scale like trash ehich is where boomkins fall behind.
---
whats BS about blizzards statement is that GMs did fix loot issues in classic all the time
---
If there is only one guy capable of using some item. You cant call that reserved. The item either drops or not.
---
Reserving is when more than one guy needs something but only one can get it if drops.
---
Yes... Its fkg bs. Retarded even.
---
But hey, its the new generation of gamers.
---
"I NEED IT, ITS MINE"
---
I haven't used it in classic but from what i used of it in other expansions it works like this.
---
You can only roll need for a weapon you can use and also only roll need for your main armor type. So a level 60 warrior can only roll on plate and not on leather or mail items which can be beneficial. The same the other way, a priest can only roll on cloth, so no leather, mail or plate.
---
Thanks for the detailed response
---
My official reddit android app has ads
---
lol.. As if you didn’t understand what i meant. You trying to insinuate 5g is a proper fee for a minor enchant such as the one I named when provided mats is acceptable then you’re just like the salty people in this guys post that are mad about him enchanting for free lol
---
It wasn't stupid, I had absolutely  no idea how this was accomplished, either. Just because there was a method doesn't mean it was stupid of you to not know. Be nicer to my friend /u/love45acp, they're a nice person!

She casts boulder but it's out of LoS so she doesn't get the cast off, just stands still. She doesn't use the aoe unless you're right next to her.

Then you look at LFG and just see "LF Tank LF TANK"
---
The crit buff moonkins supply is actually super good for hpalas
---
Nice, and it even just takes twice as long!
---
Is that for nature protection potions in the future?
---
Yeah fair call, but if he got the eye wouldnt he get mats anyway lop
---
3% crit is a lot more than 3% damage for an ignite mage, but it’s also limited by the ignite cap since every mage funnels into one 5 stack.
---
Foresight is a good thing
---
Boomkin form didnt exist until patch 1.8 in vanilla. The thing in feral which looks like boomkin form was the shapeshift talent to reduce mana costs.
---
Yea of corse, that’s the one spot available. Not much wiggle room that’s all. No one is in lfg asking for spriest, ever.
---
Plenty of great off spec items to be had in there. Demonshear, Crown of Tyranny, etc.

How in the world did you communicate the transfer of a pet on the AH?
---
Naming your pet *Wrongtarget* is such a double edged sword. While it disrespects the shit out of bad pvp players (and is therefor funny) it also lets them know to press tab. What a tragedy.
---
It says what is auto passed in the chat box.
---
I'm not strictly sure, but I think you're replying to the wrong post :p
---
This is behaviour that some would like to know to stay away from. Ninja looters for example, their names get spread like wildfire. Consider, not blocking out the name for this reason, please. 
---
But i do agree with you. 15 is too low for it. You want a dungeon run, not a boost group.
---
Ah, thanks
---
18g is a lot for some lower levels you know
---
I love how the whole "Classic community" fell apart over typical retail mindset once everyone hit 60. Game is even more GMFY than BFA right now and it's sad.
---
Nice activism bro.
---
If I'm correct, I think if you finish the initial quest that activates the quest for the transponder, it's possible that THAT quest no longer becomes available, but I'm not sure and I'm not looking to test that theory :p
---
Not really because it’s a 1h so your damage is awful.
---
Get addons, grandpa.
---
cept it wont because that's a retail thing
---
As of 11 days ago, they do not

---
You can always ASK for it. The problem is how aggressive mages become when you even dare to do that. Like you.
---
Not really in a good pve guild. You already stated it’s a PvP weapon why should the guild pay for it? Selling the mats for consumables for raiders etc. would be better for the guild
---
There's a good shoulder enchant, and you can get access to good consumables, recipes and at exalted you don't need to invest resources into the Naxx attunement. Relatively easy if you do Strat/Scholo a lot.
---
WoW moments that are funny
---
You guys are not prepared for classic.
---
When took years to get stuff and hundreds of dungeons later.
---
Now people want stuff asap. At all costs.
---
People used to like to play the game and get rewarded. You dont like to play the game if you consider a waste of 2 hours. You just like rewards.
---
You guys are playing the wrong game.
---
Atiesh splinters would certainly be reserved by the guild that leads a pug... But then again we're waaaaaay to far from making pugs in bloody Naxx!
---
Should've told him "we have a heal, you can dps, but we'll kick you if you end up doing less damage than heal" \^\_\^

You're so cool

Easy convo to sort out the toxic plebs so you know not to group with them in the future.

what options though
---
I'm the spriest for my guild and I do really good damage in dungeons.

 Just its once every two packs as you're oom after every fight. That's the issue with the spriest is mana. I've farmed a lot of consumables for raids though.

My troll druid on retail used to run with warbear chest/pants, the voodoo mask, it was another trollish look, theres also the tobes from pyromancer loregrain? In brd that goes well with the mask
---
No, i could say more but there will be 9/10 post to follow who also dont want this. If you want a new look re-roll or play retail.
---
Ok so, if a shield has 25 block, then if you block a hit that would cause 100 damage you would only take 75 damage.  100dmg-25block=75 dmg
---
If you have enough gear
---
Probably depends on how fast you want to be. I did both back then.
---
Had a group with a warrior that already had the chest so everyone greed rolled and one of our guild priests got it and said he was going to troll tanks with it
---
My brother was a big Athene fan but he refused to acknowledge it was a cult.
---
Good answer.
---
those levels are mighty fun too. theyre all just weight classes. other 19 twinks ARE the competition, and classes do have very different roles.
---
I saw MC pug announcement once. "mats reserved, boe reserved, epics reserved.....eye of sulfuras not reserved".
---
You would be right if we were talking about Retail. In Retail, if you state loot rules, then GMs will ban for ninjalooting. For classic that does not hold up. GMs want players to blacklist ninjalooters and they won't ban or do anything about it, even if the ninjalooter stated loot rules.
---
Nobody likes the lag, the question is just how much do you try to replicate the Classic experience, and spell-batching was part of it. It allows for certain tricks in PvP, and people would be annoyed if their 15 year old tricks would no longer work, because the engine has been updated.
---
Now you can say "updated for the better" and you probably be right, but with the same argument you could update the UI, enable certain addons, implement LFG, and so on.
---
As someone who leveled my Mage using a mix of every possible way to level a Mage, I assure you that the drinking fatigue is the same regardless of which method you’re currently employing.
---
I hope he gets ignored by every major guild on the server
---
Wow so many times shit happens on Arugal. I love visiting your subreddit just for that nonstop Drama. Truly a garbage tier server.
---
No it's not worth it.
---
It's artificially coded lag meant to replicate 2004 era internet speeds, it's absolutely awful
---
Go back to your lush jungle, islander. Frostmanes are no longer a part of your horde.
---
Goblins are on their own faction though. I'm pretty sure the Steamweedle Cartel is based on true free market values, so they don't pay taxes anyways. They get paid by Orgrimmar and Undercity to run the zeppelins.
---
No one cares.
---
Who's gonna join a group that they can't roll on any items with? Fuck that I would rather start my own group and wait for it to form.
---
Without trinket rogue has literally nothing it can do against a mage. Any opener -&gt; Blink -&gt; Poly -&gt; Reset and now the fight is starting again except at full range and without opener.
---
I could totally see it.
---
Any screen shots of it happening? Im assuming the Discord mods would have deleted the messages, otherwise Id just go look for it myself
---
The horde pays them per player. That's why the horde cities are so poor and reek of piss, dung and rotten flesh.
---
The More You Know.
---
 spell batching is clunky, but it's so amazing, #nochanges
---
anyone who isnt having fun while playing the game should either find something else in game that sparks more joy in them, or find a new hobby. why play a game if it isnt fun?
---
When I say “this one item is reserved” then the group will naturally be filled with players who DON’T need this reserved item. Who is so stupid to join a group that reserves an item you need?
---
No matter what you reserve, it’s never something other players in the group need.
---
I don't if it's some where on the Internet anymore but there was an Add-On back in the day called "Blacklist" which let's you put characters or whole guilds on a Blacklist which automatically puts them on the ignore list.
---
But the game isn't the same as it was back then anyway. Shouldnt we stop pretending it is? The gear is 1.12 content gear which is so overpowered compared to the original gear. Same goes for the pvp gear which is 1.12 pvp gear in 1.2.
---
Is there an post addon that summarises everything you opened if you do mass-open-mail. And tells you how much gold you collected?
---
Hmmm i‘m on same server same faction and my guild has also +500 members.. whats your guild name ? :D
---
/who „guildname“
---
and Ignore them. Repeat for a week and ur fine
---
Can you explain why its amazing?
---
Nope, same in vanilla.
---
Can you explain why?
---
Winterfall Firewater, the biggest HP potions, runecloth.
---
Speaking for myself, I don’t react differently either way, but I become somewhat miffed when it’s framed as a service I am required to provide rather than a favor I am asked for pleasantly. Water is provided in either event, but there’s no need to act like I’m your employee and you’re entitled to the water I produce.
---
on the contrary wouldnt it get boring 1 shotting everyone all the time? in a world of twinks everywhere, you have more potential for actual competition
---
I still kill every horde I see, or at least try to. Was getting rage scar yeti hides for quest in Feralas, had horde come in and help me out. We took turns on mobs until I finished. I killed him on my way out to turn in. Farkwad the gnome rogue has to live up to his name.
---
I'm about to reach level 60. I have been grinding the last 5 levels because dungeons was a chore and I like to just chill with a movie and some killing.
---
At 60, which things should I do to prepare me for raids? Some attunements, some special dungeons or some certain quests that I need to do?
---
when we're talking UBRS, you don't need a tank, just a "tank", and even then  you just need it for the 3 big packs before last boss, and then the last boss himself as long as you have a hunter to kite him. In my guild we use our melee dps'ers as "tanks" throughout the dungeons, untill we hit a hard boss or such, then our feral dps goes bear for a bit then its done. 
---
The game is piss easy compared to what we've been used to on Pservers. But you do you.

---
Tbh, it looks like you and your friends were abusing your positions
---
Ok, bet you don't actually go live there.
---
The post says that items won't be *transferred*. Violating clearly established loot rules can still result in punishment per their anti-scammer rules, it's just that the item won't be transferred to one of the scammed players.
---
That sounds totally fair tbh; in terms of PvE, it's essentially a vanity item.
---
That is one hell of a pitfall of a discussion.
---
Honestly: I loved the more difficult raids on Nostalrius, because what we currently do to MC is just brutal. Imagine a guild of random semi-casual players in blue gear downing Ragnaros reliably in his first phase in 2006. People would have told you that you are crazy. However if they would increase the difficulty, maybe even add a few more abilities here and there to make the raid more fun, those not-so-semi-casuals would no longer be able to down even the first boss.
---
And that is the problem of taste and a huge audience: someone is always disappointed.
---
So our guild is in this position, we have enough people who can farm gold efficiently and help out with mats that we haven’t had to sell any of our drops. We have even given out stockade pauldrons to one of our tanks. We plan to give one of our Shamans the eye of rag for PvP while helping him build it. Guilds can be successful in PvE content and still contribute to the PvP side of their guild as well.
---
This is how you make gold as a tank.  Become a tank prostitute.
---
What the fuck?  Why wouldn’t someone want to know every available recipe/pattern/whatever for their profession?  I feel like you knowingly said some stupid shit because you thought that Pokémon like was clever.

One private, they kicked my mage after shortly inspecting for a MC pug of theirs, because I wasn't "geared enough."  My mage had a couple of BWL epics, Bloodvine set and Bloodcaller.
---
Looking back, he was always insane.
---
Not really related to the post but does anyone know of a black wolf/dog that is tamable? I lost my dog a month back and made a hunter alt as a tribute to him. I wanted to get a black dog or wolf cause he was a black dog. I googled it a few weeks ago and I guess the wolf pups the trolls have for pets in the Hinterlands are black but that was all I found. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I was definitely salty, there is more above this where he was being a dick and it tilted me. So I felt justified when I watched him die cause hes an ass hole
---
I cleared MC and Onyxia with 12 days /played. While its a lot of playtime it's actually not so bad, because now nothing is forcing me to play and its great because I can participate in PvE content. if the game was like retail I wouldn't be able to maintain the grind in perpetuity due to real life obligations, thats basically my point.
---
Also, you can totally finish the game playing 2h a day and not even every day mainly because a few of my friends that's how much they play and they just got to 60, and they are farming the prebis and I'm pretty sure theyll have cleared mc and ony in a couple of weeks.
---
Then what are you doing with it? It’s not worth anything as a PvE item, so you’re better off selling the mats and censoring the hammer
---
Awesome thanks for this! Cleared BFD the other week and ive never ever realised that there was a boss underneath the temple. No group members have ever mentioned this either. 
---
I'd like to avoid using these maps on the first run through to keep the adventure feeling but on future run throughs they'll be really helpful, cheers!

My strat live rule is orbs on round robin with the first one going to the tank(I'm not a tank). Only had one guy complain about it so far since he somehow thought it was a scam.
---
I don’t follow.
---
That's why I said they stop queueing for BGs. 
---
Twinks ruin the experience for them. You can deny it all you want but it's the truth. Honestly separate twink queues was a good thing when they added it. Also proved that twinks were just lying about wanting to play against other twinks because twinking died down a lot after that.
---
I admit I don’t fully understand the issue.  What does spell batching allow in the game now that is egregiously advantageous?  What is the attractiveness of removing it - how specifically does that improve the game experience?
---
Lol gotta go watch The Rundown now
---
There is tho just not something you can buy in the shop
---
End game especially is littered with them. I’ve benched my 60 Priest because of this and I’m working on a class I’ve always wanted to play (inc. on retail) but for some reason never got round to - Hunter.
---
I’ll keep the Priest but I’ll doubt I’ll go back to him as a main unless the healer over abundance sorts itself.
---
The replies you're getting so far are about the viability but you seem to be asking about the playstyle whole leveling. If you find it engaging, then awesome, because that's the biggest complaint. I cant stand leveling unless I'm partnering or dungeon grinding with pally. They are really fun healers. But the autoattcking is bad
---
 To be honest though, it's pretty much the same as enh shaman to a degree.
---
Tbh its time then to talk about a guild merger w/ your guild. Ours happily merged with one slightly larger than ours... and has now absorbed a small guild's worth of singlets. We've started hosting MC and Ony runs and now have another small guild lined up for merger... and a possible third guild merger on the table after that.
---
That's the nature of classic. Small guilds struggle to raid - so join forces and take your small guild to a slightly larger one... and then find other small guilds to join up with. Negotiate officers getting a place at the table, and raid roles.
---
Like, for our raw numbers: started w/ a 5 man core guild and merged with a 6-7 man core guild. Picked up 4-5 single raid-ready people who's guild ditched them/were in dead guilds or who wanted to raid but didn't want megaguilds.  Now we're a roughly 15 core member guild in negotiations with absorbing another 5 man guild... and possibly like a 6-7 man core one after that.
---
You can't have poaching if your whole guild moves together :p
---
I don't think it's a huge problem. You can after all just pick a different group if you're not happy with it. I'm on Kromcrush and getting groups for my priest is ridiculous.  There are SO MANY PRIESTS. I had to respec to shadow and pass on all loot just to get a ST group so I can get the quests done. 
---
I honestly wouldn't mind if all the loot was reserved. I just wanna get in a damn group so i can get some XP. If someone wants to cash-in on that it's fine. It beats fighting a bunch of 60's for quest mobs or getting ganked over and over.
---
Reserving was a thing in Classic and on private servers. Not sure what your point is.
---
Farm then you massive baby instead of running the dungeon?
---
It is, but vanilla was never about allowing the masses to experience the content and downing all bosses. I'm not suggesting gatekeeping content. But the game is not in its vanilla state as it stands. Changes have been made and were playing on either the legion or BFA client. Why do we cherry pick batching as 'an acceptable' vanilla experience. Yet having gear and debuff slots that are suited to the raid tier isn't suitable? 
---
Blizzard are already inconsistent with what 'vanilla' experience we receive. Layering is considered a necessary evil, yet we have batching as a unnecessary evil anyway.
---
I usually heal up people who are about to die but then they end up running and make me take all there mobs making me die. So I've dropped.
---
Ok
---
Or I farm while I look for groups in LFG chat instead and make actual money while finding a tank that isn't an entitled prick lmao
---
Don’t put words in my mouth. Make your own point.
---
Take a look at some leveling guides. 5-6h per day, you should be 60 already if you aren't faffing around buying silly things from AH etc.
---
Maybe. I think it depends on the needs of the Guild, and how well everyone is performing, given the composition of the raid group. Having [looked at](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22589/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian#see-also) all 4 variants of the staff, and being someone who plays none of the 4 classes (so no bias)... the Priest variant seems the best; it's a massive upgrade from Benediction, too. 
---
If it were to go to DPS, it would likely go to the top one within the guild, be it Mage or Warlock. And this staff comes out in the same space as where being a Warlock truly pays off. Plus, they all have an aura effect, and Mage is +2% Crit, whilst Warlock &amp; Priest adds +Spell Damage / Healing instead. So for example, in a raid with plenty of Holy Paladins, who have already reached their crit thresholds, the +Spell Healing would likely be better for the raid.
---
Are Relics available yet? What Phase will they be?
---
So then block is not as good as dodge or parry as those don’t take any damage? Seems stupid as fuck that a block wouldn’t fully mitigate a hit and the block rating wouldn’t just apply to every hit... wtf
---
Lol got my hoj 7runs after this run
---
Sorry, but that's a fucking lie and you know it. We are't idiots. Don't insult us.
---
So, make resources available to sell to get some of that gold. The economy in WoW, just like RL, is not a zero sum game.
---
He is even starting to look like Jesus.
---
you always hear this, but... HT 4-5 is only like 350 hps. your tank isn’t taking more damage than that?
---
Lmao you wish.
---
achievement unlocked:  you’ve signaled all the virtue!!!  How does your own farts smell?
---
Yeah I like the original experience aspect with no changes to class fundamentals. There has already been some changes and blizz are cherry picking which ones to adopt. Eventually with some community pressure we can force them to improve batching at the very least.
---
How viable are feral tanks and resto druids? I have a 43 hunter main and a 27 mage alt I just have no interest in playing. The idea of tanking seems pretty interesting to me, especially with how needed they are but I'm not sure I want to deal with warrior's difficult and costly leveling. I'd say a majority of my time is solo with 2 hour blocks of time unless I'm specifically running an instance. I realistically will never be fully committed to raiding due to time constraints and probably focus on using my hunter for that time anyways.
---
The idea of having a Jack of all trades alt seems like it would be enjoyable but is being a master of none too costly? If I do want to bring it into raids I assume I'm going to have to run resto?
---
I guess this is a long way about asking for info about druids, anything you can help with is appreciated.
---
It’s group loot meaning everyone can need or greed anything, the loot setting of need before greed is what actually makes it so you can only roll on equippables
---
No thank you. I don't want barbershops.
---
Ok. So the DPS that can quest 5 times faster, farm a huge amount of gold alone (especially now with DM coming) aren't entitled when they want all of that + what you as a tank get?
---
But hey, missing out on a few green BoEs when you're just doing the dungeon for your pre-raid bis is such a huge deal.
---
Hey there. Appreciate the shit out of posts. Any way you could recommend the “least” CCP supporting cellphone? I’d rather get off apple as to not support two businesses that are POS. Also, do you have a list of other businesses I could support in the US that is anti-CCP?
---
Imagine thinking you need to be a good player to clear vanilla content hahaha
---
You seem like a very angry person.  You simply cannot farm as a prot warrior.  It takes forever and a half to kill one mob.  Respeccing and paying 100g to go fury is a terrible idea as well.  Not only are you 100g in the hole, but there aren't many good farms for fury, nearly every other class is better at farming.  I dont see why you are so mad at the idea of reserve runs.  If you don't like it just find another group.
---
Wouldn't the shaman be able to trade it if he did win the roll since it's epic?
---
can u show us a video soloing her with this method?
---
Yes, and I’d highly recommend starting Ony attuning chain at 55
---
They'd be penalized because this is illegal in real life.
---
Saw most people do 20-25g per ring, sometimes 5g for a run without a the ring
---
STV... more like
---
STD
---
In a heartbeat. The new guild won't care and if he joins as a regular member there's fuck all he can do to ninja anymore items this way.
---
Ninjas were applauded a lot of times back then just like they are now. It created drama but guilds took them in out of spite and a raiding spot was always open so nobody really cared in the long run.
---
Ony attune is a pain in the ass. Knock that out
---
He watched me die to 2 alliance... Nothing I can do there bud.
---
Except they're not stupid.
---
Sure, so is a high damage 1h with spell crit. Warriors get prio on Ironfoe because they benefit so much more from extra swings, where a rogue will replace it with any epic weapon from MC/Ony.
---
It's much more likely they have a tank that only agreed to come along on the condition they get all the unwanted loot to sell.
---
It's an increasingly common gold farming method.
---
Haven't played classic yey (unfortunately not going to either because I like having a job and girlfriend), but does ' ss ee oo p ' work now?
---
Huh, weird rule. Well, there's always realm specific subreddits
---
Yeah fuck that.  That's exactly why I rolled on a PvE.  When I'm ready for it, I can PvP all I want, but I'll pass on the time wasted by being ganked when I'm levelling up/doing something else.
---
People on my server charge 20G until ring drops.
---
Not surprised if he gave some BS excuses, most mages on classic are clueless, they are the new "huntards"
---
You seem like a very stupid person if your only concept of "farming" is AoEing mobs instead of farming nodes or herbs which you will likely only have to kill 1-2 mobs to clear the node and being fairly safe in that spec as far as PvP lmao.
---
It's simple economics, I don't want to tank your strath run and you don't want to sit in LFG for an hour when you can be home in 45. The market uh...finds a way.
---
Who knows? If an RP-PVP server, they could have been husband and wife prior to Arthas’ downfall. This could be from Before the Storm.
---
Ah, no, of course you are right in every point, and I hope to hit 60 in a couple weeks, and you can enjoy it and do a lot of things.
---
I'm just saying 12 days of playtime (~300h) in a month and a half is NOT little time and definitely not casual gaming.
---
Not that I wouldn't like to devote a hell more of time like I could back at University days. I have a job, I have a girlfriend and a dog, and am having not as much time to sleep as I had before. This 90g mount ain't gonna pay itself!!!!
---
Not every class is going to be able to solo farm DM.  Not every person who can, will.  Inflation will happen, and it'll be noticeable over time, but it's not going to be game breaking.  Most people don't have the time and patience to do DM solo tribute runs until they get absolutely filthy rich.  Most people (like me) will do it until we get our epic mounts, get some extra operating cash, and then walk away from it and play normally.  Keep in mind that blizzard didnt design DM intentionally to be solo farmable by certain classes, so the release of DM wasn't intended to "flood" the game with gold.  
---
Due to the nature of inflation, you won't have to farm DM to benefit from the extra gold flowing into the economy.  Items you're now selling on AH for 5g will eventually be worth 10g etc.  If you're selling items on AH to make money, the price of those items will increase as the DM farmers money becomes more free.  So as long as your only source of income is not fixed (like by farming grey item drops off mobs), then you will also benefit.  
---
I played a warrior (badly) during vanilla, and I missed out on things like this as a gold making opportunity.  I learned how to play the AH and I made good money doing it.  This time around, things like the DM farm were big factors in my class decision - which is why I played a hunter this time around.
---
I made this as a tutorial type video back in 2k6, during the short 1.12.0 patch.

---
Gadgetzan to Org is the only FP in the game with a reasonable path.
---
That's because they strongly desire #NoChanges. Warts and all. And it doesn't make much sense to me either, possibly ties into nostalgia for some, and mob mentality for those without nostalgia. 
---
I won't argue that the core ideals of Classic is perhaps the best it's ever been in WoW's life. But we could lose the warts and ascend Classic to the next echelon of greatness. It's why I'm in the #SomeChanges camp. ;)
---
Lol op wants a pity party. Ffs get thicker skin
---
My guild chat is always popping it can be about things in Classic or movies or whatever lol.
---
That's not how IF works. When it procs it clones your attack, this includes things like Execute. If your autoattack didn't proc WF then the clone attacks won't proc it, but if it did, then the clones will each have their own WF proc.
---
&gt;poor warlock.
---
You’re playing the second best farming class in the game lol
---
Only in raids
---
You're so fucking stupid, do your parents even like you?
---
People aren’t complaining because they’re “too popular”. They’re the best QoL class in Classic which makes more people play them.    
---
They’re complaining because these mages picked mage because it’s fotm and don’t understand that not everyone is a mage, and they just cause a hard time. Which means that they’re *bad*.
---
I''m aware but in leveling dungeons the mob level has a much greater impact then the amount shield block takes off the crit table.
---
Why use many word when point will do.
---
Me too!
---
Should never have been put into the game, it doesn’t even work remotely like it did way back when. We probably won’t see changes before BGs, but the pitchforks are coming once people realize they’ve effectively ruined a large part of the game.
---
Well the problem is that engaging in meaningful PvP is kinda tough now. If you surprise attack unsuspecting players who are in the middle of something, you find little challenge and many don't even bother to fight but try to run to a more suitable res spot.
---
A couple times I've had a great fight by finding a target, then follow him and spam /chicken a couple times, sort of playfully taunting them into attacking me, and then it's on. Super fun when it goes right. Oh, and I never win these fights anyway.
---
Just ask some high level mage to make you like 4 or 6 stacks and tip em a fraction of the money. If you're polite, someone will be happy to help.
---
Just find a half decent guild with active members and you'll be fine. Don't know why people don't do this.. shop around until you find a guild that works for you, there's plenty out there.
---
I did it the other day when I decided to remake my alt on a second account. Might only work with the name taken by a different account?
---
Who in their right mind would pay for that? My friend ran it 23 times before the ring dropped.
---
Any class with no gear and no talents can last through any MC boss. Actual difficult content on the other hand is a different story.
---
Correct you wouldn't be able to survive hence why you can't boycott them, but this is a video game
---
the boots are dropping all day long and it's pretty easy to get better rings. I see a lot of groups trying to find healers all day cause they don't want to go golem lord.
---
Wait till phase 3 twinking
---
I made an in-game friend who is a resto druid, met up with him at about level 50.  In resto spec he tanked the first half of BRD without an issue (level 53).
---
Ok, good luck finding another tank.
---
If you have windfury you have chain heal.
---
So you try and farm gold for an hour while your party afks in org trying to find a tank, I see how this is way different.. Lmao
---
I like that even on a pvp server where senseless violence reigns, sometimes even friendships between horde and alliance can occur. I mean you see that mentality also with the NPCs, often there are NPCs from both factions who are good buddies.
---
Shaman rolls after the mage, so if they win they can ticket it to go to the warrior or rogue.  Increases the chance of the mace going to the "right" people. 
---
(I'm guessing)
---
Why are you leveling Prot instead of DPS when you can sword and board as arms or fury almost as effectively as prot until absolute endgame when you just respec for gearing? You can still farm a ton of gold with proffs, and only 2 classes can "farm DM" so that point seems stupid at best.
---
Ya to an entitled twit I suppose that dumbass logic almost makes sense lol
---
We're gonna need a bigger screen, because this is a massive projection.
---
Sometimes when people feel good, they like to share it with other people because sharing happiness feels good.  It isn't complicated.
---
I thought they were made at the a Taiwan factory, which isn't China even if China claims it is
---
It's mainly PvP which is being damaged by the leeway. Melee feel so odd.
---
Imagine a whole guild of people contributing to a goal and then one coward taking all the mats and hearthing... absolutely pathetic.
---
Then they sound pretty bad, I've just done princess 5 times in holy spec. I thought this clip would be enough, go try it yourself.
---
unless you have 18% crit you're not going to be generating more rage than prot
---
so why bother taking the extra damage
---
That's the reason why you can't stop supporting everything china, but this is a video game you can literally stop supporting it without any repercussions
---
Sadly it isn't. I've had somebody ninja after stating loot rules and GM said there's nothing he can do. [Here's the blue post that confirms this. \(Again, if you haven't seen the top comment\)](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic-updated/131586)
---
They should make this give rested xp so it's like an undead only feat of strength thing. Any open gravesite should.
---
Tfw there's people still playing classic that never enabled "lookingforgroup" chat in their chat settings lmao talk about a dumb shitter
---
70% is in TBC and onwards. 100% in Vanilla &amp; Classic.
---
Damn seriously? Pallys op haha
---
That would be so cool if that happened!
---
I'm glad these people point themselves out. Even if I don't need anything that is "reserved" I still wouldn't join because you know they are just going to be assholes while doing nothing and letting themselves be carried.
---
Blizzard isn't responsible for any wars. They're responsible for licking the behind of a communist dictatorship
---
Nope, only for raids.
---
The #nochangers bitched and whined and pounded sand over the issue until Blizzard caved.
---
He stood there and watched 2 alliance kill me. I ran up to him and he watched them kill me. and he whispers "Why are you fucking with them? They dont bother me?"
---
Bruh they attacked me, I didnt do anything. lol He proceeds to be a dick. 
---
I probably should have nova'd the mobs off of him, and he probably shouldnt have been a dick.
---
Kill the horde sympathiser!
---
I believe that the paladin was meant to be symbolic of a deeper thread that the game didn't explore because its an ancient RTS.
---
But this is also discussed in the books as well, I believe. Inherent distrust and lack of unity was a major factor to why the made the decision to side with the horde. Definitely not the deciding factor, but it was a factor.
---
Because if you reserve an item that’s BiS and tailor your group in such a way that you don’t even have a class that can use it (besides you), you’re just smart and trying to get an item you need. Also why would anyone join a group where an item they need is reserved? It makes no sense.
---
If you reserve EVERY item that no one needs as part of their BiS, you’re just a greedy fuck. And People would have to be dumb to run with you. How is it so hard to understand?
---
And one of the strongest pvp and pve endgame classes.
---
As a Warlock, is there any level where i should respec?
---
Or can you level from 35-60 as SM/Ruin?
---
Just do it like we did it back them: relevel an new char
---
Alot of people do, the thing is they dont do full runs, they skip everything and go straight for princess. That ring is most definitely worth paying 20G for, and it’s BIS for alot of classes.
---
Correct! I keep thinking it's post 2.0 nerf.
---
Yeah I can imagine.  I did SM from 28ish to 41ish and if I wasn't able to hearth to Brill every time my group was ready, I probably wouldn't have run it half as much and would still be piddling thru my late 30s/early 40s.
---
That’s exciting- MC and Ony are hard!  *yawn*

Yeah the class fundamentals are pretty good; some roles for classes just need a number fix. It's insane how many specs there are that can't hold a valued position in a raid. Mostly due to running out of mana. 
---
I don't think there would ever be enough community pressure to change something like Spell Batching, given how large and vocal the #NoChanges crowd is. All gloves are off after Phase 6 though... who knows what they'd do at that point. Though TBC seems most likely, instead of Classic+.
---
Until Rend, including Rend, there is no need to tank anything. A few days ago I was healing in a run in which the leader failed to invite any tank and the other healer ragequit after I won the jed trinket over him and we still killed Rend without any issues. Nothing actually hits too hard until then. Also a complete waste to bring a second healer.
---
Once i hit 60 one of the first things i did was go on a date night with my husband (who does not play wow). We got dinner and saw IT part 2. 
---
Like, the 'lol go outside nerd' is tiresome to hear... but it can feel good to give your guildies a night to play catchup while you ho hang out with your significant other and/or friends. Or just take a self care evening and do some irl grooming catchup (i like to moisturize and clean up my and exfoliate my feet), make yourself some brownies , clean up the empty water/soda bottles that playing wow spawns... ;)
---
Like, idk about you but when i get sweaty playing wow i've usually let irl stuff slide. Now is a great time to catch up!
---
Polymorph/single out melee mobs or u know... find a spot with only melee. Yetis in feralas were dope for me while leveling. Didn't hurt to be a skinner/miner either

If people want heals they shoulda...

When the game launched there was no “Shop” button, but they added it back only a week after launch and no one even cared. It’s how you get to the free realm transfers. Classic Hegelian Dialectic strategy... “Oh the realms are way too over-populated? Guess we have to add free realm transfers... oh and to get to them use this Shop button... *cough*... there, we solved the problem we created... you’re welcome players.”

In my server fused wiring auctions for 1g!!!! How/why is this?
---
For a small text field in an in-game browser this seems pretty OK.
---
I actually bought a run tonight because a priest was offering free attempts and charging 12g for the ring.  Got the ring first try. 
---
Normally on my server I see 3g per run and 20g if the ring drops.
---
lmao yep, probably because of the Night Elves abhorrence for their drug of choice, black tar mana, baby!
---
Because it allows some crazy fun stuff to happen every now and then. Like mages polymorphing each other in a duel and many more cooky interactions. It's but one of million small things that make classic fun.
---
I am also interested
---
I keep thinking it's 70% cause of the TBC prepatch. Remembering it's pre-nerf makes me want to reroll pally haha.

Where is Garrosh when we need him bruh

People on here will never change their mind no matter how many times you prove them wrong.

Both gnomish and goblin have useful pvp items, the biggest difference being some gnomish items are BoP where the goblin items are BoE, so a gnomish engineer can just purchase the BoE goblin items they want to use. Engineering has some very niche uses in pve namely the seaforium charges for opening locked doors/chests, and goblin sappers.
---
I'm not gonna lie this is kinda sad, as the feeling of things "lagging" is one of the few things i dislike about classic. Great game otherwise, but keeping clunky things just for the sake of it being like 15 years ago seems like unnecessary catering to a vocal bunch of people.
---
What mobs should i kill inbetween dungeons as a lvl 55 warrior with skinning? Ideally in burning strppes or plaguelands so im close to dungeons.
---
But theres already been changes is the point I'm making in a lot of these comments. Gear is more powerful, layering exists and macros use the BFA/Legion client. 
---
Whatever makes blizz more money will be the ultimate answer for what comes after p6. They're definitely a business these days instead of a game company.

You're using the word communist as it's a sin. It's a different economic system, so what? The capitalist US system is based in debt and has every US citizen under 35.000 dollars of public debt. You have only two parties istead of one. Omg, what a huge difference!! In the US you get shot by being black, you get locked up if you reveal government wrongdoings, the health system sucks and you're overwhelmed by debt. I choose China 🇨🇳
---
I've not read two books - the Arthas one, and the Illidan one
---
there have been no times where high elves have even been in the *position* to treat them differently and detrimentally based on their race
---
I do believe you are confusing being "racist" and "not liking" - the two are, of course, entirely different things
---
It works just fine, but realistically you won’t notice a lot of difference between deep prot and fury-prot until you have at least a few key pieces (Ony neck, strikers mark, flame guard gauntlets etc) and bis blue gear.
---
The tldr is that you sacrifice mitigation for threat, the thing is, in order to get a lot higher TPS, you’re gonna need to sacrifice much more mitigation (mainly armor and stamina) for AP, hit and crit in phase 1 and 2. In p3 we get access to better legs, rings, trinkets, a decent fury prot cloak and other stuff that aren’t necessarily best in slot, but still offer a lot for the build. Compared to what we have now where a lot of dps pieces have no plate alternative.
---
That being said, the only requirement for tanking in MC is having enough hp to survive a crit, which means above 4500 hp buffed. So you can basically do whatever you want. Mitigation obviously makes it a lot easier
---
They off-tank and spend most of the raid as DPS.  Raids can easily accommodate 8-12 Warriors.  Only 2-4 are needed to tank at any given moment, but they still bring baller DPS during all phases of the game.
---
2004 server processing speeds actually, but really same concept.
---
As a rogue is it ok to put poison on a weapon with built in chance on hit?
---
Aaaaand the mobs cast Veil of Shadow. If mages cant manage to decurse in a raid environment, do you bank on pug mages to decurse the Veil Of shadow in a UBRS jed/rend run?
---
*crosses fingers for classic+*

my Rogue alt will never have an ally wifu to wave at me and cheer for me.
---
I am aware of this but most of the playerbase has no idea. It's one of those things that should be made stupid proof because most players have no idea what party commands are or their purpose.
---
I've seen people get mad and quit groups because the leader switched to need before greed and 3/5 idiots thought he's some kind of master looter and stuff like that.
---
In any case need before greed should be the default setting if they gave us a multitude of options.
---
Classic has been so awesome. Only been ganked once and I’ve spent the majority of my time with buffs from other players.
---
I do like interactions like that, and I'm sure there would be a way to reduce the latency aspect of spell batching to keep that possible whilst also reducing melee leeways and stopping rooted mobs from windfurying the first thing that comes close.
---
Oh c’mon, this guy is called ocarina :D it’s from zelda. We can cut him some slack

I've done Jedd about 15 times and have seen it zero times. Fuck.

I like it more.  
---
Separated small functionality, that won't mess with your heals.
---
I think you don’t generate any rage either when parrying (get haste tho) or dodging!
---
Pretty sure this is incorrect
---
Yes, spending now 30s becomes reaping 5-7g once AQ40 comes out.
---
I'm pretty sure you're a tank
---
People vastly underestimate how much gold you get from running dungeons. Minimum you'll get 10g, most you'll get is 30g+ from just selling all the shit you get.
---
You'll notice a lot of their current changes has made the game easier to maintain... Such as using the final versions of pretty much everything, instead of working the way up the patches, etc. Unless there is something intended in the game, that needs to be fixed to adhere to their view of authentic, nothing will change until Phase 6 at the earliest.
---
It's good you're coming to terms with reality
---
Underrated comment. Seems like American exceptionalism has rendered Americans unable to engage in an intellectually honest critique of their own "democratic republic". It's easy to think in terms of "America good, China bad".
---
Swosh is fuckin cool
---
let's be honest, **if** it drops everyone is going to try to ninja that shit lmao
---
Shitty people with shitty opinions?  Yeah.
---
I think both that and frost nova shatter are working as intended that way. But there is a few other things which aren't that I would like to see them address.
---
As one of the guild members, this is what happens when someone goes mad with power and writes his manifesto as if he didn't just fuck over 120+ people.
---
Well my first clear, this was my 5th run and 3rd time downing the boss that dropped it.
---
Why are you questing if you're not doing it for leveling when the gold yield is almost always less for the time investment than other alternatives? Also I think you're the one who's "lost it" if you actually thinking "farming" = grinding mobs. Not to mention you literally mentioned DM specifically which can only be efficiently cleared by 2 classes so not sure what the fuck you're even on anymore lmao
---
It was always like that.
---
I think you're that guy
---
Quite rare to drop and used for several important engineering recipes
---
why would you go for bone slicing hatchet? with a offhand that fast you would waste your flurry proccs for offhand swings
---
SO WITTY
---
Your name sounds pretty similar to the Lotis in the linked manifesto post, just saying.
---
[you rn](https://imgur.com/k603Ech)
---
I have no problem making gold.  You just don’t like it for some reason.  None of those methods come close to dungeon farming of playing the AH.  Btw is there any reason you are calling me a retard over my gold making method?  Seems unnecessary.
---
Hey moron, we are talking about how long you have to wait, not what you can do while waiting. Keep tf up lol
---
Dang y’all both seem like salty little mongs in this
---
Yes, 20 when the ring drops
---
i'm not the one getting upset over the term noob
---
Is this your first time playing WoW?
---
Instant poison doesn't use a debuff slot
---
I think the warrior could roll on all armor types. It doesnt matter what is their main armor. Could be wrong, that group I ran a dungeon with that had it on was WC, a good 30 levels ago.
---
Yeah that's just awful.  Definitely explains why I always saw hordes of Alliance (lol) outside the instances on my server.  It is a 70/30 ally split, but outside SM it was rare for me to see any horde hanging out.
---
I suppose they stayed once they got there until they were done with SM altogether.
---
Make them your battlenet friend and you can chat!
---
You actually think that other game companies care about Hong Kong?
---
This so much, sure the US has issues, but at least we can talk about them. If you say anything critical in China, your gone. How do we even know the body count for China isn't really high? who would be able to leak such information?
---
Its moments like this that restores hope in humanity, and then there's pally players... Long story short, level 58 alt character, pally kept bugging me so I clapped his ass.
---
Can one outlevel a quest? A couple of times I've seen grey exclamation marks disappear and never become gold. Marshall Haggard and the female dwarf near Valgar Highforge. Apparently for the former the quest requires 22, but I'm 26 now and can't see anything?
---
A dungeon with a level 29 final boss is a level 18 dungeon? What?
---
Swosh = traitor ;p
---
Is the dagger really that good?
---
Lying shits
---
You pay when it drops...
---
Well, that goes for every class and role though.
---
Something more like this then? http://imgur.com/a/2ZDgRsG
---
This would be awesome, but I doubt it'd turn out like how we want it.
---
It feels fun to progress and make your character more powerful. Farming gold efficiently in instances is significantly more fun than questing is for a lot of people because there's no fighting for mobs, or distracting pvp, or riding all across zones for 20 minutes making no money or xp, etc. It's a fallacy to think that the entire community values one certain thing, i.e. "community." The community I'm most concerned with, for example, is my guild, and I want to get stronger so I can be an asset and crush shit with the boys.
---
Blizzard didn't do anything to HK. Get over yourself.
---
These gloves won’t be replaced till around 55 or so as a rogue, and possibly as a  feral Druid.
---
Idk where you’ve been, but most blues/epics are certainly worth a bit more than their vendor price and you trying to tell OP otherwise is rather ridiculous.
---
I love how most of y'all didn't do a damn thing untill Hong Kong affected your VIDYA! 
---
 See yeah though! Have fun and Latah ! Lmao
---
They go for about 25-30g on my server
---
Not for PvP
---
that particular phrase is on the translator site. Bothers me a bit.
---
Absolutely yes.
---
The fact Blizzard taking action on someone using their platform for personal political statements makes you lose fun in a game... or that you think Blizz really cares about sub when retail is a bigger cash cow even without subs. Not sure which I find more hilarious
---
It's not super efficient with Priest, but doable. Princess is WAY faster than she was in Vanilla (likely a bug in the FrankenClient) and she stacks thrashx2 for 5 hit windfury nonsense.
---
Chaotic good meets lawful evil.
---
exactly but drop 1 point out of imp battle shout and Put it in imp execute
---
Can you not even read what you're commenting on?
---
 What part of "don't need" do you not understand?
---
I was on deviate delight too. But I unsubbed from wow since I'm working on getting into a new apartment.
---
How is it a trio though? Not like you can dual wield AND use a shield...
---
Or having a shaman with windfury totem?
---
Edit. Or do they stack? Correct me if dumb
---
Fist of Omokk from LBRS or Bonescraper + Tome of Knowledge from Stratholme.
---
are you referring to the single recipient for mooncloth boots?
---
As for the rep killing the furblogs and the repeatable quests in Celsius/wintersoing give you rep.
---
Wowhead has a detailed Timbermaw rep guide with every detail needed.
---
That’s why if you’re the one carrying then you lead and you set it to master loot.  Why even deal with arbitrary‘ninja loot’ drama when you set the rules upfront?
---
Guess so yeah. The next good one drops in RFD lvl 39
---
You can, if quest is gray to you - it won't show ! mark.  
---
But you could still take it, if you speak with this NPC.  
---
So level 60 could return into starting zone and do all this low-level quest, if he want)
---
I understand you're having issues but what part of  (*especially* now with DM coming)  Do you not understand?
---
People are fucking dumb. This is why I start all my own groups.
---
Fuck these trash begging kids that can't run a dungeon a few times to get something.
---
Spoiled little brats thinking the world owes them shit. It doesn't.
---
he wants the booty
---
Wrong. Rogue opener &gt; Mage blinks &gt; Tries to poly &gt; Vanish.
---
Well my point was that there's exactly not "15 years of content" to catch up to because you only need to catch up to the latest expansion content which started 14 months ago, and most of which is irrelevant already, so progression wise you only need to catch up on the latest major patch which was less than 4 months ago. Everything outside of the latest expansion is dead content anyway.
---
Is this in any way true or just another of his stunts? This dude was trolling so hard for so long that I can't imagine this being any different.
---
An active guild chat has always been a big thing for me, it's nice talking shit with people while you're out grinding. There were loads in the first few weeks throwing out invites on my server (mirage raceway EU) but the one I was in started dieing off when the officers/GM became less active. Lots of people stopped playing and there were no new people coming in to make up the numbers I guess. I've just joined a raiding guild as a social (I'm only level 50) but theres always conversations going and people making groups, so hopefully once I get to 60 itll make it tonnes easier getting into decent dungeon groups and a raid spot, right now it's just for the social part though. It can start to feel a bit lonely and isolated out questing/grinding without the occasional guild chat conversation I find
---
I dislike it as well. For me pvp isn’t fun with spell batching and leeway.
---
This quest gave me cancer, I didn’t complete yet and rage everytime I try. I believe there is nothing worse on earth!
---
[:)](https://i.imgflip.com/3207s2.png)
---
Nah man, I'm serious.  You're so brave for doing what you think is right, and then going on to the internet to proclaim to everyone about how noble you are.
---
You guys need to go outside lol
---
That's not how to math.
---
I’m 37 and don’t have a family and don’t have time for this. If you have a main that is that high and already an alt that is high enough for stv, you play a lot. A lot a lot. You should spend some time with your family.
---
Even level 22 is too low for Stockades.
---
The burning steppes rare (Deathmaw) is the exact same as a level 18-19 Slavering Worg from SFK (courtyard after first boss): 1.2 attack speed, black worg model.
---
Man i hope you feel better after getting this out of you. 
---
In the future, just ignore those people if you dont want to run with them and the rules they set.
---
Yeah and the reason they added loot trading and personal loot is to get out of that. Theres a reason you used to wait 2 days to have tickets answered. There is better things they can spend their time on.
---
Lots of NFL talk in mine if it's not about the game. Our Guildies are always helping eachother. Of the 140ish of us 40-50 are online at a time and we're all between 30-45 with 2 60's and another 3 guys in the 50's.
---
Bears are very viable in dungeons 1-60. They are even viable in raids, except where bosses have one-shot mechanics and bear don't have anything to survive.  
---
P.S. Jack-of-all trades is very bad) You need to actually be good with both healing and tanking with normal specs, and taking dual heal/tank spec after it.
---
&gt;I was definitely salty, there is more above this where he was being a dick and it tilted me. So I felt justified when I watched him die cause hes an ass hole
---
Ill just put my other response here. I def was. He was 60 and easily could have killed them. Then gave me shit for "fucking with them" when in reality they just walked up and killed me.
---
That's because it's me. And if you think some cropped pics of private, out of context discord chats are proof of anything or a pic of a loot prio sheet where literally 2/3rd of the underlined names are MT/OT pieces prioed to tanks I don't know what to say.
---
Congrats and that is definitely cool, but couldn’t you just wait for AV and get these?
---
Spot on.
---
I’m no lock expert but levelling I’ve found dark pact extremely useful. I think it’s worth the cost to respec at 60
---
Thats the thing, it’s not better.  If you are a good tank you can power through these dungeons pretty quickly.  Why you are so mad about this is a mystery to me.  And why do you think I’m whining?  I don’t give two shits either way.  If you are mad about res runs don’t join them.  Frankly you couldn’t pay me to carry you in a run anyways.
---
what a piece of crap.
---
Yeah, you're right. Which is also why this is fine. If the tank "reserves" the un-needed items then it doesn't hurt anyone. Since they're only there for certain boss gear drops which they will get, assuming they drop.
---
The character animations in retail suck ass tho, would be kinda cool seeing new models on old ones.
---
If you dont understand the difference between needing on bop and boe items I dont know what to say man.
---
Tank druid yes, and the actual difference in damage output isn't that massive (even assuming bear form) against most mobs time wise, not to mention you also have the higher survivability so less downtime for healing/mana compared to other classes, the actual difference wouldn't be that massive, especially if you roll a druid for cat form.
---
Should be pretty obvious.
---
execute Phase is huge as 2h fury
---
China #0
---
No it’s a pain in the ass, absolutely. Some are even worse than this one.
---
I'm sorry but I even if what you say is true and this guy is cool, what was done here is an unforgivable mistake. Even if he accidentally hit the need button, a second window pops up TELLING YOU that the item will be bound to you if you loot it. 
---
So your friend is an incompetent idiot.
---
What you're saying also seems a bit odd because due to the nature of this post, its clear the warrior knew exactly what this item was, and definitely should of spoken up if the mage was telling everyone to need because they thought it was a boe
---
EU here and I agree completely. Take the APES guys for example, great players but it’s no secret that most of them are on welfare. One of them quit his job to play Classic.
---
Love me some frank reynolds
---
I tend to try and get all the quests for the dungeon and the clear it once. Maybe twice if there is something good in the dungeon. Later endgame dungeons I’ll do more than once obviously as there are Pre-Raid BiS in them. Levelling dungeons will get any gear replaced.
---
I get this when BRD sometimes with healers. “Level 48 priest, just beat princess”. Yea no way . The amount of aggro that would be pulled at every corner would be insane.
---
Let's say your trying to run deadmines. Do /who warrior 18-22 and whisper all of them not currently in an instance, "want to tank deadmines?". Rinse and repeat until group is full. Works 10/10 times.
---
Bear in mind DM is out in a few days and far less people will give a shit about mara ring

---
You can barely carry a train of thought, I'm honestly terrified at the mere notion of you tanking lmao. The method you're using is still objectively worse for gold vs time. Again, if you don't "like it" that's fine, but it's objectively inferior to the alternative lmao
---

Frostmane is that you?

---
I should reroll on a EU server. Do they get toxic with their hardcore-ness though? I want to play with people who are serious about the game but are still nice and have some silly fun once in a while. The casualness and unrelated idle chatter are growing tiresome on my NA server.

I've been using the one from wow-pro and it's been great:

You don't, you lose every time. Might win some with free action potion.
---
So many ppl here proud of MCing ppl into water from boats, of MCing people to their death in BRM it's embarrassing.
---
I was using a couple of green daggers from like level 20 and at level 33 I went and solo farmed Toxic Revenger. It was a huge upgrade and can definitely be used into the late 30's comfortably.
---
       
---
The good thing about it is that it has pretty slow speed for a dagger (1.9) therefore makes ambushes / backstabs hit hard.
---
What add-on are you using to get the combo points showing below the mob’s health bar?
---
Can somebody tell me what’s happening?
---
Found the undead rogue.
---
I noticed the EU players being more into their character and putting out quality content here. I wish I could say the same for Americans.
---
Hey there friend, did you accomplish your goal? I would love to use those wallpapers for my phone to spruce things up. I hope you saw it through and it wasn't *too* difficult...
---
\&gt;Saturated with healers
---
Huh?
---
Wasn't old Iron Forge a thing too, or did that glitch not come til later? I started in BC and I remember if a mage dueled you under a certain staircase in IF and then Polymorphed you at a certain spot, you would teleport to old IF.
---
They can get toxic yes. Very toxic. It depends on a guild by guild basis really. I had to jump around quite a bit to find a guild thats serious but without being toxic bout it, but I did manage to find it :)
---
No, they won't be in until P5
---
Everyone's all like honk kong... china... protest.... police.. etc etc
---
I just wanna play classic wow for crying out loud!
---
When's all this going to blow over?
---
Absolutely hate spell batching
---
azoroth autopilot is sort of what you are looking for.  Its based off a path someone took to hit 60 in like 4 days played.  It will tell you the next quest to pickup, complete, or farm but if you stray off it's path it doesn't like that.
---
I play an Orc rogue, but good try.
---
One of the shittiest things I've come to witness in Classic so far is exactly that. Lvl 60s ganking ppl in Gadgetzan.
---
Did you take the tram?
---
Mind sharing how long it took you? I’m planning on doing this grind when I get closer to level 60. Gratz on the awesome mount!
---
I asked in world chat if anyone has any info on him and somebody helped me track him down.
---
Lol you're really ass mad about this
---
Can I ask what Addon tells you someone stealth nearby? I play without sound a lot, other things in the background. Haven’t had a rouge do this to me yet but it’d be very useful!
---
I use it fine with standard raid frames.
---
Should probably act based on the drop rate, rather than your friend's impressive sample size of 1.
---
Not trying to come off as steep, but with a drop rate of more than 20 %, a princess run averaging more than 4g profit (plus gold from other boss drops/gatherers) isn't too shabby.
---
&gt; But the game isn't the same as it was back then anyway. Shouldnt we stop pretending it is?
---
"I lost my pinky finger, so my arm isn't as good as it should be. Shouldn't I stop pretending it's worth keeping attached?"
---
Your logic is as broken and dysfunctional as the current implementation of spellbatching is.
---
The existence of a few inaccuracies does not give carte blanche to change everything.
---
I admit that you're probably right.
---
It was pretty disconcerting when Blizz pulled Blitzchung's winnings in addition to the ban for breaking the terms of service (using the platform Blizzard provided for political speech). Blizzard reinstated the cash winnings, and reduced the ban(s) to 6 months.  We've seen 6 month bans for exploiting layering, so consider that.  
---
Imagine if Blitzchung had donned a "Make America Great Again" hat and chanted "LOCK HER UP" during his interview.  Same thing would have happend, but you wouldn't be outraged, you'd probably be laughing.
---
Why would you even.... as the GM you can just say it's yours cause you're the GM... I mean.... totally retarded.
---
that's incredibly bad luck. I went 2 out of my 7 farming runs without getting them, average was like 3 stichings per run. BTW, you should be able to reserve all the drops without drama; almost nobody else needs them for anything yet anyways and most won't mind since they have no sell value.
---
Get the supplementary addon AtlasLootClassic\_Maps, will put dungeon maps in the background with numbers for boss locations
---
Sure,  not sure that this has anything to do with leveling though
---
Someone misunderstands that quote... lol

Currently full realms sti have the option to transfer to a specific server
---
What a damn amateur!
---
That's how ya do it:

Step2: Gkick everyone.  
---
Step3: Disband guild.  
---
Step4: Transfer to another realm under a different name.  
---
Step5: Transfer item to an alt.  
---
Step6: Delete character.  
---
Step7: Delete account.  
---
Step8: Flee to Mexico and change your identity to Raul Alfonso Tejada.  
---
Step9: Profit.

What is not scummy about supporting a dictatorship over roughly 5% of your earnings and possibly losing a lot of business Morally, you have no ground to stand on. 
---
And ya, blizzard as a business has every right to suspend him and whatever else is in his contract. As a business, they should understand them being shitty on a moral level may have repercussions on a business level. How is that hard to understand?
---
That's Classic. Every build has a role. Raiding is only one small part of the game.
---
And he’s an undead that’s interesting. They’re usually the most gank focused of the horde races
---
Every American will tell you that the US is good and China is bad. That Americans are free and that Chinese people are oppressed. It's a very narrow minded view of the world. China's government has to bring peace and order to 1.6 billion people. America struggles to keep 350 million at bay in between mass murderes (highest rates in the world), police brutality and having most of citizens under prescribed drugs. I take China
---
Thank you
---
It makes me so happy that people are finally realizing how fucked up China is.
---
I think your reading into my comment that I want changes left right and centre. Which I don't. I'd prefer an amendment to the messy spell batching we have.
---
Your arguement comes across as nothing but aggressive tbh.
---
Quiver fishing is highly damaging to the ecosystem. It not only takes the fish out but also kills literally everything else in the area destroying the ecosystem. SHAME ON YOU AND ALL HEINOUS QUIVER-FISHERS!!!!!!

New to warlock and wanted to know what everyone's thoughts are of [this warlock video.](https://youtu.be/uc3advdw5RI)
---
Everyone I watch usually recommends lvling with voidwalker and pulling 2 mobs and maybe fear juggling a third.
---
This one recommended lvling with imp to 60 and taking one mob at a time. 
---
Which method would most of you guys prefer?
---
My Pally Alt is 58 and already did MC and Ony. MC except Rag is very easy to PUG, Ony even more so.
---
Shame it was waste on the horde.
---
Sucks that orcs look so dorky on horses
---
I guess, I would personally never join when anything is reserved, even if I don't need the item. But if he can find suckers who agree to it, good for him.
---
That's BiS raid headwear, what are you talking about?
---
Yeah i guess it's their only option.
---
Because you're lying and saying only a huntard would use rends when they're unironically the best item available outside of a raid environment.
---
We're done talking now
---
how does one go about retrieving their data
---
You can't grasp what the term "objective" means, and your only counter argument is constantly circling back to "but I do this and it's good because I said so!" When it's not comparatively to other options that "you don't like". That alone is enough to quantify calling you r******* because even when presented with evidence to the contrary you simply default to, "No! My way is better because I said so!" Going so far as to simply try and handwave all of the viable options earlier because, at this point honestly I have no fucking idea beyond stupidity. I also severely doubt you're making "a ton of gold" if you're still sob storying repair bills as a tank lol.
---
Ah you think hate is your ally? You merely adopted the hate. We was born in it, molded by it. We didn't see any invites until a guild needed tranq shot, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!

Warden staff is mostly for tanking. There are better stat sticks for dps
---
I’m level 53 and haven’t got a blue boe yet....
---
The game batches (groups) all actions that happen in a certain short window and has them happen all at the same time.
---
This causes certain effects to stack up and appear to happen all at once when infact they should have happened prior.
---
It's to simulate the poor server quality and internet of the 2000s.
---
US treats its citizens better no doubt, but overall they're responsible for more bad stuff when you include imperialism
---
Why would anyone join a group like this? Just let them spam in trade for 4 hours looking for a group before they give up.

I downvoted you because this gets posted here like once a week. I find kiting around the room is easier anyways since it requires less focus.

Not saying you're wrong but I'd like a like a link to a blue post.

Will they though? You do something this shitty, it will follow you.
---
No. You don’t need this extra mana in endgame. Just use life tap
---
Just get bagon addon so you can move your inventory window around
---
Maybe you don’t get it but tanks sometimes don’t need anything in that dungeon. What is the purpose of spending a hour doing something you gain nothing from? Tanks have two options. Log out and level a alt for gold or tank dungeons they don’t need and try and make gold from the party. Tanks also take huge durability costs by tanking hits throughout a dungeon. Get off your high horse and expect that tanks
---
need to run these dungeons for the dps.

Stop buying raid consumables and farms dungeons. Wait until DM is out and farm that with a healer who can herb.

I'm a fury warrior btw, who can just as easily tank.

My point is downvoting comments not the post.

If this gets posted here once a week, why is the top comment "Even the pro streamers I watch cant keep her there the entire fight"? That's who I'm replying to and downvoting these comments instead of the post is dumb.

I feel like Thorium Point is more dangerous than STV ever was.
---
It's not a shield
---
I've had interactions like this before.. I'll say what I normally say here, "I'm not your babysitter, I help people who can help themselves." Honestly, it looks to me like you wanted someone to kill the people on you, but if you had the ability to run for help, you had the ability to fight. Do not ever say you can't win because there were two of them. People who gank in groups are generally grouped because they are bad solo, if you killed one of them, I bet the other guy would've died too. Instead, you ran and died. This is a case of "get good or get got."
---
Yeah I was kinda piggy backing along with your post, knew it would get deleted so placement didn't matter that much.
---
Amazing
---
I'm sorry dude, but you have to kill him. Your elf family strongly disapprove.
---
Who in their right mind would pay 20g for their bis item?
---
Literally everyone.
---
Thanks! Appreciate it
---
I also play that much..... but I have it spread across multiple level 30’s
---
Why didnt you post THIS 1st?
---
the hero we need
---
You could also use the fence next to the south tunnel at Loch Modan.
---
With the right angle you could get yourself on the slope of the mountain and jump your way up. It takes a lot longer than the mount method (because you have to keep climbing to the farm while the mount method gets you there almost immediately) but you can get up there as early as level 1 if you're dedicated enough.
---
XD its lasting longer than I thought
---
What level we're you when you solo'd for MCP? I tried at 34 and got wrecked.

This glitch is actually starting to annoy me.  I see my quiver a lot more than I see my 2 hander.

Seems to me like you just feel entitled
---
You don't.  At least not 1v1.  Best chance is to open on them get a hamstring and then intercept and hope you have killed them by that point
---
they are alts to help summon lazy raiders to get their dousing thing
---
dog is man's best friend. cows are not. do you seriously need someone to explain that?
---
Yes, unfortunately im Orc.
---
They took his pants and her hat !
---
I don't get the point of whining about these conditions. You don't have to join his/her group.
---
Why does it bother you? It's often new players being excited about the game, I think it's wonderful. And there are a lot of people, so, yes, it may get repetitive.
---
it a smartphone pic I bet
---
ZUG ZUG!
---
Probably for summoning raiders to turn in quests or get quints. I lvld a lock to 20 for this
---
Thanks! What's wrong with Gehennas?
---
But people declining group invites "because I don't wanna share xp" then expect others to help them when they fuck up are 100% assholes.
---
Because they’re dumb. 
---
Regardless, I still stand by the streamers don’t do it because it requires more effort. You have to actively monitor to make sure you strafe spam right. Running around the room is mindless. 
---
stormlingx, the biggest Druid streamer behind soda, does this strat.
---
Nice try but the brightness gives your lacking screenshot skills away
---
was it your phone?
---
&gt; I lost my dog a month back
---
When I read this, I was like "should have fed him you idiot"
---
&gt; and made a hunter alt as a tribute to him
---
Then I got what you meant and was like, oh fuck, my condolences :(
---
Because they don’t speak up when they pander to the gay community. It’s just pandering. 
---
So if you own a diner, and the waitstaff goes up to every customer and says they’re for genocide, probably gonna lose some business. That’s what they did. Fucking post they wrote was not even by a native English speaker. 
---
Heads up, China is committing genocide as we speak. Guess finding another way to enjoy yourself is asking too much. Have a good one.
---
They are there to click the portal. (third warlock alt logs in to summon the 60 that needs the NPC)
---
That's all well and good.
---
It doesn't change that there's really no need for it and the price/performance is bad. 
---
&gt; "It's also unfair to your guild to be slacking on gearing"

Wow man, it's just a videogame. Nobody cares whether I have enchanted my gear or not.

I'm not raiding mythic retail raids pushing in a top 100 guild.

It's friggen classic mate.

This reminds me of a rogue me and my friend met in menethil harbor. She’s a slut so ofc she started flirting with him to save her life and he fell for it. These two were going back and forth for a good minute. Then all of a sudden we see someone yelling in general chat. “PLEASE SOMEONE COME HELP US! THIS ROGUE JUST KILLED EVERYONE IN TOWN.” I looked at my friend and I’m like wait can it be this guy? Nah he’s too nice and flirty PLUS he hasn’t killed us. Que some random walks by because we were next to the gryphon and BAM he kills him. Moral of the story. Be a NE slut and flirt with everyone.
---
La Rosalia
---
So instead of being a better person and act the way you wish others would act, you acted exactly like the guy you whispered... Nice achievement to share on reddit.
---
I don't get it.
---
Bravo Hamish! Bravo!
---
Can’t help others if you do not have the time to help yourself first.
---
ah yeah they are there with a level 43 warlock
---
With steamwheedle? Nothing.

Whether he had more context or not, he still sounds like wasted breath.

No one going to say anything about needless LoS pulls?
---
If you're not going to body pull anything, and the pack's already grouped up, then why LoS? So many dungeons where the tank needlessly LoS pulls the entire dungeon when they could just pull to the ranged mobs instead.
---
Dont even get me started on how most tanks walk back in line of sight before the ranged mobs get to them which completely defeats the purpose of LoS.
---
i have a fellow dwarf hunter that is KoS. dont even know if he was the original guy that ganked me in swamp of sorrows at 7a in the morning but i imprinted on the first lv 41 dwarf hunter with a bear pet i saw and i fight this guy everytime i see him.
---
Druids are more of an exception. They are naturally versatile in any spec. I totally understand a prot warrior or pally not wanting to run around and farm, since the time it takes for them to kill is huge compared to other classes and specs. Healers are the same. Takes forever to grind with a healing spec.
---
Totally agree. At some point I hope the community starts to relax a bit and we see some kind of balance evolution.
---
Boomkins need help. Ret paladins and prot paladins could use a bit of love. Mages probably could be dialled back somewhere. It could still be just like Vanilla but with some balance. You don't have to change rotations or add Solar power or any of that. Just a little bit of tweaking and eventually some better itemisation.
---
i think the point of confusion is that i said RAGE generated not THREAT
---
my bad
---
It's a top comment that's calling it not possible sourced from a clearly lacking amount of experience, causing the post to be hidden from view, hiding a post from view isn't about "fake internet points". The video was posted to be informative not for karma.
---
Auctioneer takes 10 seconds to scan, just use the fast scan instead of the slow one. It's the double arrows button
---
You'll see a lot more of everything you just mentioned when pvp comes out. 
---
There just seems to be ideal leveling/early raid specs for each class.
---
In full Naxx gear it sure is (up there with Mage at least.)
---
While leveling, it sure is (up there with Hunter at least.)
---
There's just a bit of a lull in the middle there.
---
I can get why you maybe shouldn’t be able to jump between specs mid-dungeon, but it’d be nice to pay my trainer a hefty fee to quickly swap between 2 set specs instead of manually inputting it every time. 
---
I don’t see how this would “break” anything.
---
No, because leveling enchanting costs a lot of gold, more than any other profession, there's a few recipes that go for 50-100 gold, and others like crusader that go for 250-350g. What they did, reporting you to get you muted was wrong. What you're doing is dumb. You're giving your work away for free. This is losing you money, as well as losing money for every other enchanter on the server. I agree prices for enchants should be reasonable and proportionate to how rare/expensive the enchant is, but charging no gold is basically economic suicide. You're losing money, other enchanters are losing money, the only one winning is people coming and taking advantage of you. 
---
The way this looks to me is like you're purposely trying to fuck other enchanters over for the sake of fucking them over, or to gain a customer base which you will eventually start charging.
---
If you farmed crusader for hours/paid 200-300g for it, it makes no sense to give it away for free. 
---
You're not doing this to " be fair ", and to " give back to the community ". You're doing this as a shitty way of getting any gold you can whatsoever, just so that other enchanters dont get any gold.
---
I am poking fun at stupid americans who think they do no wrong and yet have the right to criticize another nation for what they do.
---
You ever lived in China bro?  Talk to someone who has that now lives in anywhere but China. They will change the way you think.
---
Haha. Yeah i got some questions who wondered if i was trolling or not. Congrats dude! Releasing a short youtube vid today! Hope ur having a good day.
---
The problem is if they messing up on SIMPLE code I wonder what other mistakes have made it into the game with complex code.
---
The corpses.
---
That's a bit dramatic. I mean when are wow classic gamers gonna get bored of politics and settle the fuck down
---
The mage hate boner is insane. They do understand CoC is a 60 percent slow with 11 second duration that is a guaranteed six hundred damage that can now be kited right? Lmao
---
Becsuse they love China
---
It's not about getting your money back. It's about making a sustainable amount of money to allow you to yourself to enchant your gear/buy consumables/buy epic mount/etc etc. If you leveled enchanting just to make your return on investment you're doing it wrong.
---
Jfc imagine feeling that entitled.
---
fucking traitor.
---
You sure? Back in the day (like, in wrath) you could absolutely get loot sorted via tickets.
---
perhaps i explained myself wrong, i am not native.
---
I said, they "would", past, do it.
---
They don't do it now, and they prefaced it they could do not ( at least initially).
---
They wanted to add the trade system that is present in retail where you can trade a soulbound item between party members as long as they were eleigible for it, but fans did not want that.
---
So, yeah, they will 100% no longer do this now.
---
Look, if canceling your account is the right move for you, then more power to you.
---
That being said, I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention to the situation in Hong Kong before this whole thing happened or not. For me, I had no idea. Had you been bringing attention to it, or supporting HK through different means? Not trying to sound shitty, I’m just genuinely curious. I know I haven’t before or since learning about it.
---
What Blizzard did was messed up, yes... but it’s a company at the end of the day. Had they not taken harsh, corrective action? Others could use their platform to speak out with potential result of China banning their games and them losing a major source of revenue.
---
Is it worth letting someone speak out if may jeopardize x number of jobs? Is there a threshold where it goes from being okay to not okay? What if it bankrupted the company eventually?
---
Also, if you haven’t seen it, Nixxiom has a pretty informative video on other Blizzard kerfuffles that they’ve screwed the pooch on handling.
---
Just to reiterate: Good on you if this is best for you. I think Blizzard screwed up, but realize that they try to do what’s best as a company. I won’t be joining you, or the HK rebellion (though I agree with the stances they have).
---
I mean, if it's about profit, the only thing that can really answer this is your own server&amp;faction AH. Of the top of my head, mining, because black lotus farming is no less murderous an affair than devilsaur farming, and the latter doesn't work out for you apparently?
---
Just farm turtles
---
You linked his video but didn’t repeat it at all, he is talking about threat you were talking about rage. Additionally skarm has been playing fury prot on his warrior in full valor on classic.
---
Remember that one quest we do as horde were we feed an innocent dog treats and then it exploded into an undead dog and we have to kill it. Players aren't the good guys either.
---
He does. He's expecting people to tip him, he wants people to tip him. He is pissed when people don't tip him. It's his way of competing in a market overcrowded with enchanters, as an enchanter himself, with no distinguishing enchants other than crusader, which basically everyone has at this point.
---
Yay!
---
that sounds like a blessing. i need an addon to spellcheck and delete emojis from one person before i end up putting them on ignore.
---
I've been to China many times and have Chinese/German friends. I'll take it any day before America.
---
Pfft real players use the pedals from their HOTAS setup by depressing each pedal for one step and alternating so you run while pedaling. #immersion
---
For how much you care about internet points I don’t doubt you want money from us too. Nice glitch bro. Congrats. Don’t take shit to seriously next time. It’s just random people commenting on reddit man. Lighten up.  I explained how your clip didn’t show us anything other then stuff I’ve seen people do before THATS ALL. Hen You went off on a bitch fit lmao gg
---
Got me.
---
helping a guildie, this dude is literally his guildie trying to do the bragging thing. In short, an idiot.
---
Plus even if you don't ML it. If you have the agreement in chat, blizzard said they would enforce it against ninjas so your pretty safe either way.
---
And here I am with pre raid BiS, was 3x in MC and 3x Ony and haven't gotten shit.
---
Lmao okay you do you.
---
Wow man, is your butt okay? It must hurt pretty bad.
---
It doesn't matter if it's your BiS, the value drops tremendously once unyielding maul comes out.
---
A lock should never lose to a rogue

Only if the WL gets cought out on 50 percent health with no mana healthstone and voidwslker
---
You need to progress through the old content to get to the latest content though. I'm not sure I really get what you're saying.
---
...but that's the point. It's not supposed to be the "general usefulness" talent tree. It's supposed to be the specialized talent tree for people who want to be better in PvP. Classic is what it is because you can make those choices.
---
You have to use dxvk, and if your graphics card doesn’t support that, you’re probably SOL
---
Entitled to what exactly?
---
I've read that intellect is more important than spell power here, just so you can get a few more off before going oom
---
&gt;By being apolitical and enforcing neutrality doesn't make you a person who supports the status quo,
---
Except that's exactly what it does.
---
This quest is an ingame cinematic... the player is not required to do anything at all for the escort or even during the final battle. The player is just suppose to witness how OP Tirion and his son is as it builds up for other event, stealth and grab some pop corn.
---
i hope you are joking. i mean its not like you could talk about it, pretty sure the guild would have paid him a lot more than 7g if he really tried to hold them hostage lol
---
&gt;Cause even the pro streamers I watch, they still can’t keep her there for the whole fight.

---
&gt;I explained how your clip didn’t show us anything other then stuff I’ve seen people do before THATS ALL
---
These two comments don't match eachother.
---
Your comment was wrong, it was proven wrong, you've shifted the goal posts to points when my comment about downvotes is about hiding the post (the effect of downvoting), not karma.
---
You've managed to misunderstand how downvotes work and my comment to somehow project it being a "bitch fit",  and my joke about you mentioning streamers not being able to do it into "No doubts I want money from you".
---
 I'd say work on your reading comprehension before you project onto others, because you're reading an explanation and unable to imagine someone explaining something without it being a "bitch fit".
---
Is it a good or bad idea to wait until 60 to tame broken tooth? I dont want to take a week out of my leveling to look but I also dont want to wait until 60 if leveling him up to 60 will be a nightmare. Can I just level him fairly easy while gold farming at 60 ? Or is it a pain?
---
All credibility is lost here.
---
Ya he is fattening him up for slaughter.
---
I hate it when people trade me and dont say anything (obv they want water but i aint giving it if they don't ask)
---
Could be. I don't live on these forums. I just saw this video pop into youtube and thought people here probably know of Athene.
---
Red is dead
---
Good that you tried to help then decided to just move on and away from his toxic energy.  I’m a brand new player and having a blast.  Mage gnome, just got my mount yesterday :).  Would not have happened without players like you.  I have run in to (more than I expected) jerks, but mostly really good people.
---
Boring
---
the moral of the story is
---
why would you want to piss off your healers for very little benefit. it's not until stupidly high levels of gear that fury actually starts to pay off
---
furthermore it only works if your whole raid can actually utilize the extra threat in the first place
---
basically if your raid can't pull off of your prot tank, there's absolutely no reason for him to be fury
---
Jep i got the same thing but i just think its funny to hit the shit out of people with a quiver
---
Are cross faction translators ok to use (copy paste from web site) or does it get the ban hammer?
---
Mate you will learn to love an 8 seconds purge\dispel once there's more coordination
---
The main thing about selling tank services is that you should be a well geared tank first. It would be harder at 30 to have anyone actually pay for your tanking abilities since: A. You may be under geared and need the dungeon as much as the clients; and B. There is a significant lack of gold for characters pre60. You're not gonna spend 3 hours in Uldaman for 4g when you can spend an hour in live or scholo for 10+ gold.
---
If I really need a dungeon run at 60, I have no problems paying my tank in drops if they don't need anything. But you better have prebis or MC gear for me to pay. Definitely not gonna reserve anything for a crappy geared tank or a pre-60 tank.
---
Well, rage generated directly contributes to threat generated. What most people don't understand is that the benefit of fury/prot is mostly tied to the added rage generation from Flurry and the use of dps gear to make Bloodthirst generate more threat than shield slam, despite shield slam's innate threat boost.
---
What you said wasn't incorrect. I was just expounding on the topic, because when to swap from deep prot to fury prot has been something that I've put much thought into.
---
Oh bro it's rediculous, every time I go on the r/Aragul there's more drama going down.
---
Forcing it for guild raids was unnecessary
---
A thief is allowed to criticize a murderer.
---
Properly geared Prot Paladin (skullflame shield/demonforge bp/spellpower) can basically AFK farm lashers, time be damned.
---
The guild master did it because people in the guild were fucking others over and lying to them?
---
The guild master? Just....kick those people?
---
Same happened to me. He said nothing... a few minutes later I said: "Still mad about that roll", he answered: "Sorry, I wasn't paying attention and pressed need".
---
Wtf did I just watch? lol Cracked a smile though, this is great.
---
Stuff this well edited makes me wonder why the fuck blizzard havent introduced more animations. Lazy af. (In retail I mean #NoChanges)
---
Wait does it show actual timers for things like stuns? Ive spent hours trying to get this with omnicc and classicauracooldowns to no avail
---
Hahahah this is gold!!
---
No what he’s talking about isn’t. You can be in the ground and still avoid threat aggro, just like skipping trash in a dungeon. Only thing that’s bannable is abusing the height advantage at places like the arena
---
No I just think people hear how OP aoe farming is and then there here on reddit asking why they can’t aoe farm like Joker..... 
---
or asking for leveling advise as a mage.. 
---
obviously picked the wrong class, for the wrong reasons. Dude is a few hours into the game and already wondering why he can’t min max lake the pros.
---
I love this.
---
Re roll
---
You made a decision and continued with it
---
Your fault deal with it
---
What’s the name of the addon?
---
Read the comment above yours again.
---
Just delete it. Scooty will give you a new one each time.
---
Your entire post is a bit dramatic. Literally none of this has any impact on allowing you to play WoW.
---
Worst part is that it's only 1/10th as pathetic as the shit you and Pronkers were trying to pull off. That's speaking volumes all things considered. 
---
Then damage control andys coming into the thread to save face. Fuck me
---
If the spellpower coefficent is that bad, a higher manapool does really sound like the way to go yeah. I guess some stam wouldn't hurt either. So pretty plain sets, like the devout should probably work really well then
---
Server transfer exists and it’s pretty much enough. If your names taken on another realm it forces a name change. So for years and years people would ninja stuff and realm hop and have a different name.
---
Elemental Mastery for sure. It lets you beat comps you normally wouldn't be able to beat.

I’ve never played wow before classic, and I did Scarlet monastery cathedral for the first time yesterday. Let me tell you, having Whitemane come out and rez Mograne was so badass, I was like yelling and losing my shit in our voice call. That might have been the most epic part of classic for me so far.
---
For my money, Scholo is the hardest dungeon because of how dense the mobs are packed, making some of the pulls very tricky.
---
Because its the best non epic offhand? Check warrior &amp; warrior theorycrafting discord

:O  Never knew about the Quick Scan option.  Always did the Full Scan.  Thanks so much!  Probably going to run both TSM and Auctioneer in conjunction since I still prefer the Posting/Browsing of TSM.

Ive farmed strat UD for that damn neck over 50 times and THREE fukcing times has a caster dps yoinked it thinking it was for damage too. Last group I formed I didn't even bother brining any casters.
---
Not true at all, they want the dm ring + the mara ring rofl.
---
Why is Tidal not allowed but AGM is?
---
Oh, fanboy streamer armies can help you with your AGM but not Nazjak camping.

Healer's gear breaks constantly cause they\`re the ones getting hit all the time?

just hit them until their hp is 0

cant go anywhere on a blizzard subreddit without hearing about honk kong, china etc

---
This is a horde guild with the same name, different server
---
Tanks have no other method of farming
---
Rockbiter wep on a 1hand and shield is the way to go. Get 2h specialization for dungeon dpsing.
---
From what I’ve seen it’s two hand with rock biter / wind fury if you want to gamble as very if not the most efficient until like the lvl 46-50 range when you can go elemental. I’m level 42 right now enhancement and didn’t invest in really any defense / shield talents but I’m also a Tauren so can war stomp and heal to increase survivability. There are probably some good shield elemental builds out there to let you face tank stuff with more armor while also blasting away with lightning, but it is also mana intensive.
---
Sounds like the GM agreed to let the leader of this "clique" have it because he's a beta. But when it finally came time to make the hammer he decided he wanted it, so he'd ninja it and whistleblow.
---
Everyone involved sounds like an asshole tbh
---
How’re they passing on greys and greens for a dungeon they otherwise cannot find a tank for? They’d not get them anyway.
---
Wrong. Poly is affected by grounding
---
we are talking about a 1v1 here which means we're talking about the try hard soul link spec' which means the WL just tanks it sacs the pet  fears the rogue after faking his kick puts his dots up while he's feared and fel Dom's another void walker to rinse and repeat
---
rogue wins if he uses every single cooldown together with prep
---
But he only wins that one
---
yeah bullshit
---
classic wow gamers only started caring after they banned another gamer... so now that blizz apologized and reduced his ban, gave his money back, etc it'll blow over soon (but not soon enough _rolls eyes_)
---
Looking at the pvp videos apes have released of their few hundred player conflicts, I'm going to say no. It doesn't appear to have made a shred of difference to server stability.
---
I don't get the demonification of someone making a demand for their service. As long as nobody is rude, being straightforward and clear about their intent it seems kind of fine. Tank gets more gold, people get far more time on their hands in the dungeons to get the loot they desire. Seems pretty fair to me everything considered, nobody is forced into anything.
---
I personally don’t join those groups. Experience shows that most of these people are not nice in groups.
---
I went from 54 to 57 only going BRD, because it took so long to farm second wind and help my tank friend get HoJ. Then I quested again and barely had any quests left over at level 60. After doing Western and Eastern Plaguelands, Unguro and began in Silithus.
---
This is the sad part. There is a ingame double check for items like this and he still ignored it and pressed need.
---
Well it sure helps more than 5% mana does. It makes a noticeable difference if you tank low level dungeons or just when waiting to get 2H in general.
---
You'll be fine
---
Agreed but the current batching we have is implemented poorly. I believe we need to alter what we have not scrap it all together.
---
Why? Please explain.
---
A combination of #nochanges retards and ‘hur hur omg omg 2 warriors charging omg so epic’ retards. 
---
The game is made objectively worse for it
---
I got my mount at level 45. And I'm now level 60 with 200 Gold xD
---
But I get around 30-50g just for a normal LBRS run.
---
To get their caster dagger/wand/whatever?
---
Blizz already stated there will be xfer. There was xfer in vanilla and there will be in classic.
---
yeah, it boils down to the gear level of your raid. if most are still floundering in prebis then swapping fury won't make a lick of difference. you're generating more threat that they aren't able to match in the first place
---
if more than half of the raid CAN pull threat off the prot tank if they tried, then you might consider swapping to a higher threat setup
---
on the condition that your healers aren't already going oom of course
---
...and a diaper full of shite too I imagine
---
Interesting. Lots of people being dicks about me thinking this (there are some conflicting sources that told me otherwise which was the only reason I assumed it), so I appreciate you just explaining what was happening. The mage was legitimately just doing this in the middle of the city, it didn't appear that he was hiding away from the guards.
---
Get to 60 as a tank and let me know how farming for epic mount goes dude. You have no efficient ways to make money besides dungeons
---
Aww poor you
---
People can vote how they want buddy. For me it wasn’t a “good” post. I didn’t downvote you till you started bad mouthing me and calling me names. I clearly explained it was a little deceiving and we couldn’t tell from your video...
---
And I  would thank you for posting the full video to show us this awesome glitch but you decided to be rude and immature instead of humble. I don’t see why this kind of attitude deserves upvotes?
---
Two questions:
---
1. Are you allowed to play an Undead Rogue if your parents loved you?
---
2. Will Blizzard suspend your account if you PVP against someone who isn't 5 levels below you and at 50% health?
---
Fury prot does not inherently take much more damage than deep prot. Actually look at the talents you’re losing and explain to me why you’re apparently going to take so much more damage?
---
If any of your warlocks or fury warriors are even half decent and bring consumes they’ll be threat capped with a deep prot warrior. 
---
I understand that you watched the video from skarm and now you’re the expert but you need to realize that’s an old video and it’s based on the pserver boss parry rates. 
---
It’s never bad to be fury prot, it gives you much better solo farming options, it doesn’t take more damage than deep prot in equivalent gear and it gives you the option to push your threat if needed. To top it off you’re going to do significantly more damage in dungeons leading to faster clears.
---
All that isn’t even mentioning how insane death wish is for any fight or dungeon with fear. Or the threat generation from it.
---
You want to be drain tank build from 38 onwards
---
Yes, but it has a max range it’s visible from so it’s not perfect as stand alone debuff addon.
---
Always throw a shred on the mobs fellow broods are killing.
---
Or we could acknowledge that wow can be extremely addictive and has ruined tons of lives. So no, I won’t.
---
Hamish is the good guy here
---
This is a straight boomer comment
---
"Orb RR" means "orbs are Round robin", i believe.
---
I would have destroyed my computer
---
It’s not about having trouble to come up with mats. It’s about making it easier so people need to spend less time outside of raiding :)
---
All right, did u check the different skins neatplates have? I use the blizzard one so it looks similar to my ui.
---
thank you
---
Things that are not okay:
---
1. Depicting People holding each others hand in death 😭
---
My dps meter gave an error when I tried to /gquit. Had to disable it. Addons can in fact interact with things they're not supposed to.
---
Oh my god, that explains why there's three Raul Alfonso Tejada in every town.
---
No because if you reserve 1 bis item the people who want it won't join?... If you reserve vendor/gold items that's retarded.
---
I used to play this game a long time ago called Anarchy Online. It was extremely open sandbox and has a lot of the same charm of vanilla. It was also a game made before a lot of the problems with things like class balance had been fixed. So it was just generally understood that some classes were easy mode and some meant you were never finding a team for anything. It doesn't benefit anyone
---
Wipe your tears away and just move on.  You play a class that has the ability to significantly help people and you’re over here screaming about someone having the audacity to point that out?  Get over yourself.
---
Still complains about his post getting downvoted... ouch. Just let it go bud.
---
&gt; from fucking over the people
---
ftfy
---
An undead rogue ambushing an equal level player is a bannable offence.
---
Nothing, OP is wrong.
---
Never heard anyone getting banned from that lol. If anything they'll warn you first.
---
I’ve been leveling as drain tank and it seems to be going fine I’m level 40.
---
Side control as in the bjj position?
---
I need to so Sunken Temple next, and as a tank I feel responsible to know the place inside-out. This map does not make this task easy...!
---
It's a level 60 elite I'm the Blasted Lands that someone kited halfway across a continent, into a major city.
---
Why do people feel the need to tell others how to live their lives? It's his family and his time - you aren't in charge of policing other people. 
---
People are really going overboard with the hand wringing lately. Do you, live your life, and let others live theirs however they'd like. It's like a lot of people on this sub took the "lol what's it like having no life" stereotype and decided to really embrace it and project it upon other players, which is bizarre as fuck. 
---
Like, my eyes get too strained to play for more than a couple hours a day, so I haven't progressed too far. But I'm not going to lecture people because they have.
---
These rats are all over this thread getting defensive when there's literally 5+ screen grabs of them being peices of shit
---
hmmmm 3.6 effort, not proud... not amazed
---
I come on this sub reddit purely for your posts.
---
I would love a wow classic anime series under your direction
---
&gt; I live in Europe and have a family here. America is the biggest threat to the world, we all know that. The world will be a better place without it, no doubt. 
---
You think we're a threat over here? If America collapses, millions of American refugees will be flocking to *your* lands.
---
Pretty sure this dragon dude is chilling near the human starting zone, and they somehow managed to maintain aggro and pull him to Ironforge
---
It’s a cavalier King Charles spaniel. A Kong’s breed not some mutt butt
---
75% dmg reduction on lvl 60 and 83% dmg reduction on lvl 63.
---
Meh, while our guild lost about 3/4 of the members after the first months, of just people who quit the game. Now that we trimmed the people who left away and invited new ones, there are aprox. 30-50 online during the main times and about 10-20 at 2am. Have to say though, the vast majority of our people are level 40+. About half are in the area 50-60.
---
Surely it's a joke I think....
---
He didnt have to help me. Just like I didnt have to help him. I didnt expect him to, but had he, he hed be alive too.
---
Mace rogue lmao. The rogue is almost as retarded as the rest of them.
---
Couldn’t you have kicked him out of the group after he rolled to negate his roll
---
Both are viable and many guilds will be looking for druids
---
It’ll be hard but you can do. Once shammy gets wf totem I think at 34 it’s a game changer.
---
It gives more options. Personal loot may be convenient, but it takes the personal factors out of loot, which is one of the biggest drives to raiding. It makes sense for something like LFR, but past that, it kills a lot of the fun of downing a boss.
---
I went in there to try and get lucky while questing in Winterspring last week. Saw a horde and alliance mage taking turns ganking each other from the roof (neither of them touched me). I don't know who started it, looked like it had been happening for a while. I laughed, reported both of them, and went back to questing
---
And? This stupid mount never drops anyways.
---
one of my fave old screenshots is going shadowmeld in there with my nelf priest. looks very cool with the background
---
Grounding totem eats poly. Its been like that since always
---
If you reserve not needed item then you don’t take items from anyone away.
---
If you reserve needed item then you don’t take items away because nobody who needs it joins that group.
---
Maybe it's increasing chance of going to "right" people, but decreasing chance of warrior getting it
---
Finding mankriks wife first time haha
---
now imagine knowing it's worse but lying to other people so you can get the better loot. pure fucking scumbags
---
Well you sure showed him.
---
Low level or max level dungeons? 
---
I make maybe 2-3g running high level dungeons as the tank. Sort of giving up on my epic mount.
---
LOL, a raid filled with retri paladins/enh shammies.
---
Human as fury with Demonshear is a very easy win.
---
I mean if you have full Naxx gear what pve is there left to do?
---
It's so fucking absurd - IDK why people feel like they have the right to comment upon other people's lives. People don't even have to tell "non gamers" about their WoW account these days to get the "lol wow, no life over here" comments... they just have to comment on this sub, which is dedicated to playing the freaking game. 
---
If someone is asking you for feedback, then by all means, offer advice or opinions. Otherwise you can probably keep it to yourself, goddamn.
---
I have made very little gold off tribal leatherworking since everyone is a tribal leatherworker lol.
---
How is DrainTank in WPvP while leveling?
---
wow is serious business
---
In what bizzare universe is Blade of Eternal Darkness BIS for raiding? Certainly it's good for aoe farming, but raiding? The only options are that you're legitimately retarded or are intentionally lying to your guildmates. Fuck off, retard. 
---
E X P O S E D
---
The human passive won’t make a noticeable difference while leveling. End game raiding etc you should be doing sword build anyway.
---
Nothing will really make the low proc chance of the sword better than the constant stats of the axe right now. It’s on a bis list for a reason.
---
You’d really have to look at the actual proc chance of the on hit effect. The chance is low enough that 1% crit and 40 attack power outweigh it. Just looking at the “it does some damage” effect isn’t helpful when comparing the items.
---
Looks like we go some certified OC! 
---
I checked 44453525 image posts and did not find a match

---
Thank you for the explanation, this is what I was looking for.  I have noticed myself switching between 1H and 2H weapons throughout my first 15 levels.
---
I’m not an expert on this, but part of it is somewhat bragging rights, they’ll eventually be able to advertise the fastest clear time on the servers. Also, it does help to reduce wipe potential if all members are flasked.  
---
Mostly about brag rights I think
---
Watch Skarm Tank's videos on YouTube. He'll show you druid tanks are viable in all but two raid bosses thru nax.
---
Well when you make a half ass post that’s super fucking deceiving,  or not even showing us the princess. Then what do you expect people to say? You say people do it all the time so then why post at all? Most people have not seen this done before and that’s why we’re questioning it. Great attitude.
---
I'm really glad you managed to find a new thing to reply to. I bet you're gonna get extra tendies tonight.
---
5% Mana doesn't amount to much at low levels
---
This should be near the top probably.
---
Oh. I agree they are a solid class-at this level of talent/skill patch.
---
It just irks me that since the game is a solved problem this time around people try and do the "oh once I get X from Emps/C'Thun/Naxx".
---
Sure, more people will make it to those than vanilla, but, people probably aren't going to pug the end of AQ40 or naxx either.
---
I'm just trying to be realistic.
---
Seems like you had no problems at all. Looking forward to trying this in case it wont drop from normal runs.
---
Yea but then you have to do gnomeregan...
---
I usually charge a total of 20g. 10g before we start and 10g if it drops. I also tell them that we’re doing like 10 runs max.
---
I use this and thread plates. It the numbers on.tue floating health bar above their head. Lifesaver as a warrior.
---
People still quest with VW at that level? I am 39 and stopped using it long time ago, it holds aggro just for a few seconds and then does useless dmg rest of fight. Only use is his oh-shit shield... the life you save having him tank few seconds is inferior to the life saved by killing faster with succubus or silencing casts with hound. Even for 2 mobs, succubus seduce is superior to him offtanking one
---
Tldr?
---
You replied as oh-so-experienced but wrong. I figured this out in 30 seconds on my first pull, get some perspective and a grip. Princess doesn't have some unique AI that makes her not behave like every other mob, and if anything she's easier because of standing still for boulder. Showing it on any mob absolutely demonstrates it being possible on princess to anyone with actual experience in the game.
---
Kiting in this method works on any mob that follows you in the game, from the starting zones to the end zones. I'm willing to prove that if you doubt everything. The only thing that determines if you can is the object you run around and if they have a way to speed themselves up (like boars do). My post showed the object I ran around could do it.
---
Replying till you find something you're right on doesn't make you suddenly correct on your original point of it being possible.
---
No, only raid items can be traded. Mage is a shitbag.
---
Dal rend set just gives off the classic experience
---
ok? blacks are getting murdered by police in the states, there's war in yemen, syria, and afghanistan but I don't hear about all that on the classic world of warcraft reddit (and rightfully so)
---
Yea and you can kill her almost twice as quickly adding in some spells while she dose her earthquake and some wand attacks. 
---
And thanks, the one who I watch do this the most is the Druid streamer Revery.
---
Yea I get that but I would have thought it was more beneficial than shield spec while using a 2H weapon but it seems like a lot of people are recommending 1H weapons too.
---
Person that puts in most effort gets priority on loot.
---
It's not Phase 1 yet.  Just wait.
---
Oh my god ghost mushrooms are unreasonably expensive.
---
You know who's not getting rage? That warrior, without the bonus Ironfoe swings.
---
Skeram Horde. It's a PvP server, but there's so few Ally it's basically like PvE killing them
---
No. Thunderclap is not good damage. But it's all you have.
---
Cleave not only costs rage to use, it deprives you of the rage you would have gotten had you just melee attacked instead. That's why thunderclap is more useful for 3+ mobs. But no, sadly, it is not good.
---
One thing I experimented with, but I've never read if it's worth it or not, is rending all the mobs up. For 1-2 targets, that will take the full duration of rend, it's good, but I don't know for more than that.
---
Criticial Crushing Blow right in the feels.
---
Enhancement shaman would be nuts too if only you could duel wield 2
---
I found my kill times were quicker with a good one handers and shield, and my survival rate was very high. You do miss out on those occasional crazy 2h wf procs, but at the price of consistency.
---
As a caster i would 100% be in favor of such a deal. Noones getting fucked here.
---
Well I see your point. It depends on your guild I suppose. In my guild almost everyone is minmaxing like that, so it would be unfair of me to them to not do the same.
---
In my guild rogues chose their prefered drops. So rogues are split, some are dagger and some are sword spec.
---
If you are just pugging, roll on it
---
Should have screenshotted my run where Felstriker and carapace dropped
---
I once was raid lead in ICC25... my dream on my hunter was to get that saurfang armor pen trinket.... x runs without getting it. I lost roll that night vs another player , temptation was too big for me and I just took it for me and whispered him that I would pay him off. He refused obviously, shame hit me hard that night. 1-2 years later he whispered me again, we talked it off and actually bonded a bit. We even had some success in arena together ! Never again
---
&gt;I'm crying in poor warlock. 
---
You can make a lot of money making pots my man.
---
It gets better :)
---
I've had people in wow leave death threats in my mail before because I need rolled a boe they wanted for their friends alt and I actually needed for my character. I had a guy spam racist slurs in all chat after grouping with me because I didn't fort buff him after he purposefully wiped our group. I had an idiot try to rally a public black list of me because I used a free action potion (as an alchemist) in a duel once where he used all of his engineering items and consumables. He even bitched on the fucking forums trying to chastise me publicly.
---
I've played wc3 DotA and dota2. I played league. Nothing has gotten close to the toxicity of vanilla wow for me. But I think the major take away is that I can be pretty subjective.
---
Also, that guild gets access to his hand of rag mats.
---
Realistically, they probably got a group within 10 minutes.
---
Why didn't he kick the offending parties?  Whistle blowing only works when you literally don't have the power to fix anything.
---
Fairbanks is pretty good for horde, not too sure about alliance. Just stay away from faerlina because it's the alliance streaming server. Unless you like that kind of stuff
---
What has that to do with providing consumables for AQ etc?
---
Honestly yes for a healer. Your heal won’t be good enough, you will have mana issues... plus you might aggro from 200 meters away...
---
So basically what you're saying is that I won't have enough rage to use slam, as all my rage will be going into BS and WW, so I don't need to worry about it?
---
If so, that sounds great, and I'll just spec for dual wielding, as you said, and the it's an easy transition once I have the gear.
---
Now try that against someone not in full greens.
---
I believe it works if you delete the character, ask a friend to create a character with the deleted name, then restore your character.
---
I just don't join those groups. Regardless of needing the item or not. 
---
Id rather heal something else.
---
This is vastly better then the groups who wait till you're in the instance to switch to master loot and then say x, y or a is reserved or all green drops are theirs ect. 
---
The easy answer is just dont join these groups.
---
Without a doubt he's a shitbag.
---
I was just asking if it was possible to trade epics from dungeons. If o, his guildie could've pressed need after seeing the mage needing, so that he could trade it for someone who actually needed it.
---
Sent from iPhone
---
He is objectively wrong. As are you.
---
Well done, once again. Keep 'em coming! 
---
On a side note, also glad someone is still leveling at the same pace as me :)
---
Maybe I can finally convince my friends to transfer over to a PVP server when that happens.
---
Everyone involved is an asshole.
---
Yeah is that a shaman that rolled on it too? So fucked up.
---
No problem, I may have been doing something similar the other day lol. I bet the mage had to run away repeated times when he messed up can be tough.
---
&gt;Uses 2 3min CDs, a 10min refresh CD, and another 3min CD.
---
&gt;I didn't use any CDs though...
---
Alright guy.
---
Low work on reading comprehension.. yet another rude and degrading comment. 👍 great content buddy! Keep it up?!? Got any more for me??? Never have I ever seen someone so tilted because of downvotes.
---
Yeah, got ya, I've been told purples in dungeons can't be traded.
---
You could just...not craft hand of rag and instead make a few thousand gold from selling the mats.
---
Awesome
---
Can/prep/cb+blind?
---
Yeah, there.
---
Our server experienced and AQ gate opening heist due to transfers during Vanilla.

You're not my dad
---
Ouch. Good one
---
As a human, at 60, against raid bosses, using swords is like having 3% hit compared to axes. 
---
(Miss chance against a level 63 mob with 300 weapon skill is 8%, and as a penalty for being more than 10 skill under the defender the first 1% hit from gear and talents is negated, meaning you need 9% hit to get to 0 miss chance. With 305 weapon skill miss chance against a level 63 mob is 6% and you don't suffer the penalty. Also the damage penalty for glancing blows is reduced somewhat when weapon skill increases, and fighting a mob three levels higher than you guarantees 40% of your hits are glancing blows, so in a way it is also a damage increase.)
---
I would switch to sword spec at 60 unless you have Edgemaster's Handguards or some other source of axe skill.
---
This kinda stuff is fun to read over a hot cup of tea in the morning. Like my version of real housewives.
---
Perfect lol
---
Are you suggesting a tank's repair bill is what justifies him to reserve 20-30g in greens and other loot per run? Especially "tanks" who run around in leather dps blues? Tell you what, I'll take all the greens and sellables you reserve and I'll cover all your repairs each run. How does that sound? Or hell, I'm feeling generous, I'll reserve all the greens and sellables and cover the whole group's repairs.
---
Stories like this make me so happy.
---
What was your flesh hide strategy/level?
---
amen, low bar indeed and people still fail.
---
Yeah I realized it said lfm 3 dps and a healer. Dude might as well get it.
---
Yes as I said, it tracks your combat log.
---
Eh, Sally Whitemane could self-resurrect until Cataclysm.
---
I didnt know they did shitpost sunday in here.
---
"Do you think love can bloom, even on a battlefield?"
---
Pick low pop one. High pop feels like LFG. Low pop u feel more connected to your server.
---
Blizzard, the creators of your game, are nose to chode with the Chinese government.  That’s why you hear about it.
---
What does AQ have to do with what we’re discussing?
---
Wrong thread?
---
So, don't join the group.
---
If you care about DPS over all the smart move would be to roll on it and switch to combat daggers.
---
I mean your using the suc so you won’t have vw sac but it’s still good just have to be ready to charm people then fear. I don’t have many issues with most classes at all. Most people don’t mess with me or other locks I see though. I did watch a level 44 drain tank lock kill a 55 mage. The mage was garbage though. But we 2 manned all the stormguard keep together and took out a whole 5 man team of horde around our level multiple times.
---
you just haven't clicked yet
---
80% of those warriors don't want to tank. They rolled warrior because they have to capacity to be the highest dps in the game, and tanking entails the opposite of that.
---
You have strong dots, good healing, and if you use a succubus while leveling, you'll be one of the harder targets.
---
SM/Ruin is the weaker wpvp spec.  You don't have nearly as much reliance on your dots and you are easier to interrupt.
---
I was doing deadmines at 20 as a dps and I have no issues bringing in lower level healers. Agro won’t be that bad.
---
Sorry. Was just being ironic. I used A LOT of cds in this clip!
---
Congratulations!
---
You had what happened to me and my buds back in Vanilla.  GM disbanded the guild without warning and took all the materials in the bank.
---
It sucks.  :(
---
Try them both. Which do YOU prefer?
---
You gotta pay the troll-toll if you wanna get in this boy’s-soul, you gotta pay the troll-toll to get in
---
Got ya lol that was my next question if I needed to have the precursor rank. So you read my mind. Thanks for the help!
---
IDK, farming Cobrann proved to be too difficult lvl 18 (too much damage in snake form) and when i could solo him - waiting for Gnomer run and pants from Grand Betrayal proved to be easier.
---
I never played with us people but checked the forums. What I have found is LGBT things are widely discussed there, but not really in eu
---
*And now I shall proceed to totally ignore what OP is asking and I shall tell him how he should play the game.*
---
Damn now I feel bad
---
It's not horrifically bad or anything
---
So he's basically reserving nothing every run. That'd be my favorite, too.
---
When u troll for so long you forget who you really are.
---
Deep trolling. What a sacrifice
---
well good on your for discovering a good way to farm the dagger you need
---
&gt; you aren’t getting ganked by an undead rogue player in STV?
---
Okay for real though I never played WoW before classic dropped so I'm very new to this and I'm now at the point where I'm doing my STV quests on my main character. What the fuck is the deal? Why is this happening? How is this fun for them? How is this fun for anyone? What the fuck is the point in even trying? Why should I not just uninstall this shit?
---
Indeed, I mean, sure, not a great experience, but so what?
---
The joy I had to fallen asleep to the original, and waking up to this is beyond knowable
---
I've found it better to use a staff and get 2h axe/mace spec asap. The damage you do with a staff is nearly 3x of that of a 1h/shield
---
He hates capitalism and is using report functions in WoW to make points against it I guess.
---
This was a great Video! Very nicely explained and done.
---
You're right, but keep in mind, NotHomo and I aren't arguing that deep prot does superior threat to fury/prot. What we're arguing is that there are certain gear milestones that you need to hit before it does superior threat. Yes, world buffs and consumables can help you bridge the gap sooner than you otherwise would, but for the average player (most of us), we aren't using consumables and world buffs for every single boss pull, so some easy to see numbers (6/9% hit, 18% crit) are a nice benchmark to set.
---
I will say that I agree with you, even deep prot tanks aren't gearing much for defense, as defense is simply wasted as you can get crit/crush immune with shield block alone. On my warrior, I'm gearing for hit and crit as a tank, with the only difference between my dps gear and prot gear being that I try to avoid leather and limit mail in my tank gear so I don't lose too much armor.
---
I had a similar situation with an alliance, except they attacked me while I was questing and I've killed them over and over while seeing them again in each new leveling zone. It's a love hate relationship.
---
just consistently run dungeons as you level.  the best caster gear has +spell damage on it, and the easiest place to find +spelldamage gear is from dungeons
---
You can start soloing it around level 45 or so. But really there's no point in farming them unless you're going full-tryhard on cat DPS at max level.
---
Big difference between being the only source of something and 50 thugs harassing anyone else selling something into buying at the price they want.
---
I don't agree. The threat talent is useless when not tanking. You get more threat + surviability from the talent I mentioned + Ferocious Bite is great for solo play with that talent
---
Hey that's not nice. I play a mage and I know how to raid.
---
I didn’t notice until I was really high that Maraudon is amazing. Fighting giants on hills with waterfalls around you. So freaking cool.
---
This is some of the best reasons to play Classic over retail. The fact that shit that happens in someone else's guild actually matters enough to talk about it. Fun times.
---
Can't transfer from pve to pvp, only the other way around, they'd still have to reroll to play on a pvp server
---
Question: Most warriors are immune to crits due to shield block. Are there some bosses in MC that bypass shield block entirely? I would think at least Ragnaros does, since his damage is pure elemental and you can't block elemental damage iirc.
---
I don't know what you mean by big picture, but taking twice as long to kill mobs isn't just a small difference. Even Prot warriors in dps gear have to eat between every mob and can die from two getting pulled at once.
---
Its not worthless or arbitrary. People can eat dogs I dont care but it doesn't change the fact that canines have been mankind's sidekick since we emerged from the caves. There is a difference that extends beyond cultures. Either way I don't really care and you seem to care a lot.
---
This is why I rolled tauren. Tauren are good cows.
---
how are they doing that?
---
Because I said we invested the money from the raids into mats for future consumables so people don’t have to farm so much outside of raids because they have jobs wife’s kids etc. ? Check what comment thread you replied to
---
what resistances are most important? mainly just wondering what to use my training points on for my pet. so far got 120 fire res
---
Get minor speed for boots, I solo princess easily as Holy Priest.  Doing it any sort of reasonable time is just getting a feel for how much dps you can burst right at the end, otherwise her Thrash will fuck you up.
---
they didn't sell out shit lol stop being so dramatic
---
all they did was temporarily ban a guy for using their tournament as a platform to spread his political views
---
Before the launch of Classic, Blizzard explicitly stated that they will not get involved in loot disputes in a blue post I can't seem to find right now, regardless of the circumstances.
---
I accidentally looted The Hammer of Grace (AND confirming BoP pickup. Yeah, I know.) while not paying attention from The Vault in BRD, and GMs refused to give the item to intended party, even with chat logs, screenshots etc making their job real easy.
---
And, it's arguable that The Vault in BRD (and to a lesser extent, the seven dwarves) are outliers when it comes to looting because there's no loot roll, and in later Wow versions, it was changed, and a quest item came from the same loot source.
---
Still, no dice with the GMs, so it's fair to assume they're just enacting a sweeping "hands off" approach on ninja looting in Classic.
---
What's the difference between quick scan and full?  Still not really sure how best to use this add on
---
Holy nova has a fixed hps.  If the dps &gt; hps, then you need to have a buffer to ensure that you survive.
---
I finally started questing in STV today.  I’m a 43 Orc Sham and I ran into a 45 Human War while we’re killing the same mobs.  Everything was cordial until a chest became visible.  I honestly didn’t care about it but as soon as I got close to it the War charged me.  I’ve barely pvp’d up to this point and was surprised how I managed to kill him without much issue.  He then proceeded to hunt me for the next hour.  I tried avoiding him but he kept attacking me.... And I kept destroying him:)
---
Not a twink item seeing as it's lvl 22, can probably get better.  
---
Probably only sell for a few gold, so use it if its a good upgrade, or sell if you need gold more.
---
if he has that gear it means hes on a guild that probably were playong on pservers before classic, and they usually just bring2 or 3 hunters to MC, and with the RNG ive had on my raids yeah they would be completely decked out, also we do split onys so thats 2 ont heads every 5 days.
---
i see
---
Argent Dawn Manna Biscuits taste so good

You just have to find the right GM to do it for you. They definitely can do it.
---
No but I know who that is :)
---
Pagle or Atiesh
---
That makes a lot more sense.
---
Never go full troll
---
Welp we killed these two probably 150 times farming gold in SM. 50g/hr too sweet to pass up.
---
They need to remove the auto mute.
---
"Dungeon entrance" for Princess runs is the bottom of the falls and not, y'know, the entrance.
---
"hey guys i just xferd here with this eye of sulfuras"
---
This the greatest thing these eyes have ever seen.
---
And I’m Alliance.
---
Would always be better to have a resto shaman.
---
:) maybe people like you on this sub aren’t helping and you are discouraging people who are enjoying the game from posting.
---
It's there. Granted, it's pretty slow atm, but it's growing. Check the taverns and various places for people doing sit down RP and such.
---
What are you talking about? Have you looked at the black dragonscale pieces?
---
Thank you, I might end up doing this
---
As far as I know, that's not possible. The extra swing doesn't proc windfury. Pretty sure Thrash Blade doesn't either.
---
Well, ofc a 2h will do more dmg.  Reason you wanna go 1h and shield is to minimize downtime. Use shock, searing tot and auto attack, you'll never oom and can continue to grind mobs higher lvl then you for days. 
---
Also, having a slow 2h and seeing them dodge, miss, parry combos is fucken annoying innit.
---
In the end of the day it's down to personal preference. I hate the 2h for above mentioned reasons.
---
Robin Hood
---
thanks my man!
---
I abandoned this quest. As horde, fuck the forsaken.
---
imagine being in Medellin hahaha
---
It’s okay. Take solace in knowing he will never feel what it’s actually like to earn it. You can’t buy or steal that feeling. When you burst out of your seat and yell out how excited you are because you actually worked hard to get it. That comes from inside. Not from hurting others.
---
There are realm types. If you chose a PvP realm, you’re getting ganked.
---
The reason it’s a thing is because the stress of getting ganked over and over again starts to create a small tumor in your brain. When you hit level 60, you finally snap and go on a psychopathic murdering spree, and the cycle continues.
---
You’re correct. If your group has windfury you should not poison your mainhand. Otherwise use instant on both in almost all situations.
---
There are areas in the game where it is just handy to be able to take care of 2 mobs at a time. I‘d go with demonology and improve voidwalker asap. You‘ll respecc for raids at 60 anyway.
---
And fired casters, and took all his winnings, until there was enough public backlash for them to reconsider. THEN they posted stating that they will ALWAYS defend China. 
---
It’s interesting that they sell and allow lgbtq on stream. Is that not a political view? When does it go from a political view to a human right?
---
That's not ironic
---
Agreed on all points.
---
I don't play a rogue anymore but letting them get opener was (is?) standard.

Holding arrows... You’re doing it wrong. :P
---
He's never going to respond to this comment, he knows he's completely full of shit and their actions have proven the GM did the right thing.
---
Light in the dark huh? That's a bad thing in STV... you want to roll around wearing vantablack, not be a beacon. :P
---
Personal loot is fucking dogshit, are you kidding me right now? Get that backwards ass bullshit nonsensical thinking out of here.
---
I am looking forward to doing this. I was thinking specing 31/11/9
---
9 in shadow for spirit tap and blackout. I play troll and was thinking the stuns might help with damage taken.
---
I can’t even understand what your trying to say, your English is so bad.
---
Black Menace (dagger from Scarlet Monastery questline) hits harder, though.
---
The whole point of Classic was to not cater to the lowest common denominator, and make the game what it used to be: less intuitive, less polished, more about having to rely on teamwork/guilds.
---
Now you're complaining it isn't easy enough again?
---
Just play BFA then.
---
Eh the shit people don't care, but my guild takes it seriously. Let all the shitters play together and wonder why they keep getting ninja'd.
---
Im rerolling a priest all in shadow, so op its actually a bit funny.
---
Hey I play on Sulfuras and you can play with me! I have two toons Gearth (A) and Springleton (A). I'm online everyday, if I'm going to miss a few days I usually let my friends know. (: 
---
If you play on Sulfuras and are looking for a new guild you can join The Scarlet Crusade. Where we take the fight directly to the scourge and we totally not being controlled by some evil dreadlord (;
---
You still aren't even on point lmfao xD stop yourself mate, before it gets worse
---
I met these 2 gnome rogues questing in darkshore as an alliance.  I knew they were friends cause they had similar names to me.  I wave at them, and they spam /spit on me.  A day or 2 later, i see them again fishing in darkshore, so i go up to them and wave.  They spam /spit again, which i found funny so i sat and fished with them.
---
Decided to re roll as horde, but I chose the same name. 35 levels later and i'm doing the venture co mining quest in STV.  Then, I see the same gnome rogues again.  I go up to them to see if they remember me, since my name is the same.  I /wave them and attempt to communicate with the little bit of common I know.  Then, they spammed /spit on me, so I knew they remembered their old friend.  They helped me finish the quest and let me get every chest in the area.  Easily my most crazy "small world" moment in wow ever.  Hope I'll see them again at some point.
---
I like his guide, but would absolute re-spec at 40 into dark pact.  Dark pact is insane for leveling and drain tanking is a real thing.
---
void is kinda trash, he barely generates agro and does no damage.
---
So you’re telling me there’s a chance?
---
What do you mean? When i said that I didnt use any cds, I was being ironic. Or have i misunderstood the meaning of the word?
---
hi, Im a troll and I want to ride a tiger is this the right place?
---
Cf
---
Always love some Gorak! All felt this pain on opening day &gt;D
---
Yep, plenty of pvp, and I'm starting to see a shit ton of LFG for end game too.
---
Get a few friends together and sell summons.  Use a mage and some lowbies to assist.
---
never played  LoL
---
I thought the rich thorium runs were always duo’d? Or are rogues/druids the only ones that can solo?
---
I mean, mine is possible.  Yours probably not.  Unless you get super lucky when ZG comes out.
---
I freaking love my simian sphere. 
---
The best was the quest item that changes you into a furbolg...but when I faction changed had to lose it.
---
For the purposes of the current raid tier, fire resistance is most useful - but really only if you're going into Molten Core.  You'll find more PvE encounters with fire mechanics in dungeons too - generally speaking.  Nature resistance comes in handy for AQ, and frost resist is needed for some fights in Naxx if I remember correctly.
---
Wow Black Dragonscale which tooks 4x Slots while Devilsaur with 2x Slots grants me what exactly?
---
Nah, your original explanation was pretty clear mate. Don't worry.
---
I never understood the point of that scene or why it was relevant but goddamn was I laughing
---
Thanks for the site but God damn what fucking cancer site is this. Why so much adds and why the fuck does it need to sent me notations...
---
Internet sites has become more and more cancer
---
Well Im not good in English that´s for sure, since it´s also not my native Language and not everythere in the World you rely on just English.
---
You have exalted with both forsaken and troll faction? My goodness.
---
Filthy horde.
---
Great clip. I enjoyed seeing how you used your skills but i am afraid I am still not entirely sure. Could you break it down for mewb rogues like me? I am especially interested bc i hemo spec’d as well. (No cold blood yet tho)
---
I just tank Plugger straight up. My weapons/gear are good enough for a straight fight, no poisons, no potions, so this advice wont help much. Just let you know the possibilities. When i did him sub-60, i definitely popped shadow resist potions and used instant poisons.
---
Open with garrote, Adrenaline Rush/blade flurry/evasion, first 2 combo points SnD, next 4-5 Rupture, then maybe one more SnD or aim for evis finish. Never kick, never stun. Just wastes energy.
---
I've aimed to do these kills using no resources whatsoever to save on money. His main damage is from spells though so 2nd evasion isn't that important.
---
One thing that has made my runs more efficient is engineering. Gnomish Cloaking Device works as a 2nd vanish. This allows me to go in with my pve spec and not miss much (I REALLY miss Camouflage though). Also the Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector has made plugger kills way easier too, casual shadow resist but mainly sending one Shadowbolt back at him. 
---
Also there's another glitch spot in arena area INSIDE the arena. May be hard to explain but on the southwestern wall is a 'ramp' along the wall that you can run up and lose aggro of any mobs. If i'm in arena area, i keep pick pocketing even if my two vanishes are on cooldown, because you can reliably get to arena with sprint/evasion and reset. Problem is it definitely takes time to reset from that position.
---
For context, I’m a level 6 troll rogue with some enchants, a curved dagger of power, and a journeyman’s stave off hand. 
---
Guild, &lt;Vengeful Frostmane Troll&gt; is recruiting any blue troll below level 6 who wants to pay the troll toll to defend this frosty hole. 
---
I have a warlock main, so summons to dun morogh will start happening as soon as we can get two others there.
---
I just wanted a simple tweak nothing else.
---
A hunter won Black Blade of Shahram in one of my UBRS runs back in vanilla. I was livid.
---
I dont.  But once i decide which one I want I'll just farm cloth turn ins.
---
Thank you for the advice, fellas! If I were to...run dungeons for hire...what would I charge? I don't want to scalp people, so, what's a fair price you think?
---
That smile at the end :D perfect!
---
Maybe you're the cause.
---
Lol...
---
....what?
---
Mostly were thinking that a lot of Int gear also got Stamina on it, being those "basic items". Then you have the Spellpower items, which usually have a low amount of "basic stats"
---
The entire reason for rolling a rogue is playing in this way.  This is why all rogues of the opposing faction are automatically KOS.  This is also a great reason to roll a rogue yourself for some nice retribution ganking.
---
how do i make the ui show party frames over raid frames, while in a raid? it keeps changing it to raid frames and i dont care about the entire raid as a dps.
---
What else is your guild going to do with the mats? There really isn't anything better to use them on, its not like people need shit for PVE encounters.
---
That's an *oddly specific* name...
---
You're looking for the word sarcastic.
---
It's not implemented poorly from what I can tell, it's just a janky mechanic that feels wrong now that we're used to smoother games.
---
Removing batching would require some mechanic rebalancing if we truly wanted to preserve current balancing.
---
Are you high? Or just drunk?
---
schhfffffffp around the corner
---
You delivered on the thighs. But where's the thiccness, did you run out of ink?
---
The quick scan tanks your fps, making the game unresponsive while it runs. Within seconds however, the scan will be completed. 
---
The normal scan is something you would only use if there are more important things running on your PC at the moment that cannot be disturbed.
---
I think you’d be very surprised if you gave it a shot, if your respecs are still cheap I’d recommended giving it a shot for a week and seeing if you like it.
---
To the point of hit and crit those are goals that a deep prot tank should be aiming for as well. 
---
To OPs question though which is the point of this thread he absolutely can play fury prot in p1 and it does give him better options for solo play and pvp. Most dungeon groups have dps playing their off role as tank, a fury prot warrior of equal skill will absolutely destroy that. As far as raids a couple stacks of mongoose are cheap, jujus are free just take a little time and you’ll get firewater while farming them, those alone should be more than enough as far as threat is concerned.
---
Mages stole the "stereotypical dumbass" title from hunters and just ran with it
---
A lot are still running
---
For reference,  see DRC.
---
no, these kind of items are so special, and only 1 in a  guild can have it  (unless the game goes on for a loooooong time post naxx launch, then maybe 2 can get it eventually)   anyway, since  you have only 1 champion that can wield it , it usually goes to that person who deserves it the most, based on the time and effort they put into the guild, in whatever role.  Not necessary the top raider, this goes beyond that.  The guild could vote on who they think should get it.
---
I don’t believe increased demo roar effect causes any more threat than if it were untalented because it causes threat based on number of debuffs applied and the effect doesn’t matter for threat. The dps boost you get from 15% ferocious bite is a pretty small part of your overall damage when solo as you should be using rip if the mob will survive long enough. The extra attack power reduction won’t help much either if the mage in the group you’re tanking pulls aggro and dies immediately which is what will happen without increased threat in bear form.
---
3 minutes goes by really fast. Seems pretty fun to me
---
My favorite is "LF1M UBRS, item X res, need key”
---
Like, go get your own damn key before you start trying to reserve stuff in a dungeon you can't even access.
---
&lt;3
---
I too am on Biggles, but I'm alliance. Maybe we cross paths one day.
---
Haha weird that the tank didn’t take it, did he already have it or smth?
---
Ok I've run my scans like when I'm about to log off I'll just hit scan and walk away and do something else.
---
So this does the same thing, just faster at the cost of processing power? And i just hit the double arrow to do it?
---
Just one? Usually its a team. And they dance on grave
---
ugh dont tell me this is fake drama like asmongold
---
I'm pretty sure I'd stop playing if he got that drop lol. Yeesh.
---
👍Great way to end it boss!More rude name calling and degrading comments. Really proving what your attitude has been throughout this whole post. Yes, people are not going to agree with you. No matter how many name calling and reply’s you try and make people look bad. The more you posted the more you just showed your true colors. GG
---
I know about the realm types and I picked PVP because I like the idea of being able to test my skills against other players and I like the idea of people trying to get the drop on each other. I just didn't realize that every single PVP fight would be a totally 1-sided joke. I had assumed a fight that unfair wouldn't really be fun or worth while for anyone whether on the winning or losing side. I had assumed that I'd go up against other players in fights where I had a chance of winning and the challenge of it would be fun and exciting either way. But instead it just makes the game become a miserable fucking slog after you've already sunk a month into leveling up a character.
---
I don't want to do a PVE realm because then I might as well just play Morrowind. The tumor in my brain isn't making me want to go out and gank lower-level players, it's just making me want to stop playing WoW.
---
Thank you! :) Yeah the video is out a bit late, but I hope people can still recall the trials of logging in!
---
I would smash my screen. This is the reason I never play with pugs! Glad I have a solid friend only group. Your keybindings looks odd to play with btw.
---
Thanks :D So many of the videos end badly for him, so I thought it was a nice change :)
---
Its trash
---
After endless name callings and rude comments I think you deserve it tbh. You can copy paste me as much as you want buddy dosent take away the fact that you were very rude just cause I said it was decieving at first... continue to be an ass hole? What do you expect?
---
RIP Thighmane
---
Completely! Wait time for I was so long my computer gave up and killed itself -\_-
---
Spec into max holy nova crit with power infusion.  Get 6K mana, just buy greens if you have to.
---
Then farm DM East lasher packs.  Pull to safe spot with wand attack, spam max rank holy nova.  Alternate between power infusion and inner focus every pack.
---
Man, you're half OOM casting Frostbolt anyway. Their's little functional difference between 2 and 20 mobs for a mage's mana level.
---
This is where the Character Notes addon can be used to make sure you never tank for him again. You can easily find another group or DPS, but it will be hard for him to get another tank.
---
There will be no balance changes made in classic other than item progression that happens as new items/recipes release. That's it, until P6. Which is probably a year away at the absolute earliest. So yeah, get used to what you have.
---
Some of the black dragonscale pieces (not the whole set) are pretty nice though.
---
Not to be a downer but I had this same situation recently and the GM essentially told me they won’t “create” a new item for me.
---
true, lgbtq propaganda shouldn't be allowed either
---
but I guess that's another financially motivated decision since americans eat that shit up
---
Spec restro and dungeon grind is what worked for me
---
This sub is for WoW Classic.
---
You could try titan panel as well. Puts a lot of good info in a bar at the top of your screen
---
Saw cobalt crusher drop in GY last night, I had bad luck with RFK so no Corpsemaker on my shaman. Mage needed on it for "mount gold" like he can't just AoE farm himself a shiny 40 mount anyway.
---
Ya, I can understand that. But I can imagine since he  is putting the group together around his loot table. Most likely a bunch of clothies. Good luck getting any clothies or healers when you dont do golem.
---
Range Display
---
Ah gotcha thanks for that clarification! I think rank11 would be harder than the faction grind.
---
Why would you have a tank when you can have 4 mages?
---
If he was GM why didnt he step in and remove the assholes? I understand they may have been the raid leads, but if the rest of the guild felt the same way then hopefully others would step up and fill their shoes.
---
I think theres some form of encryption that goes through. Nobody has precisely figured out what the algorithm is yet and I'm willing to bet most phrases are just discarded entirely and a filler text is added to make the output look more 'orcish' or 'elven' or whatever. However through 14 years of trial and error, some phrases or indeed disjointed numbers and characters do come out as legible phrases on the other side.
---
My favourite is 'go t o rE taIL'
---
Can you transfer in Classic?
---
They nerfed this Garda patch ago
---
I'm going to make a mage called Forrest now.
---
Hypocritical bully. Nuff said.
---
i'm thinkin' this guy might not even want any more raid gear.
---
i'm thinkin' this guy never got a hand of rag back in vanilla, and this was a big deal to him.
---
i'm thinkin' he just wants to wreck noobs in pvp with one of the most iconic pvp weapons in the game. he got the hammer. just have to grind honor for the other slots. he saw his chance with the hammer and took it.
---
edit: damn i thought he ninja looted the actual eye too, nvm.
---
not really. you lose ticks off the channel from damage taken, so the only time you can get full use of it is when the mob is first running towards you or if you have a shield.
---
Holy talents are by no means required for 5mans but it makes them easier, and for the rest of the group, faster. However, pretty quickly after you hit 60 you should hit a level of gear where they're not needed.

To be fair, they did *not* 100% confirm that server transfers are coming in that AMA.  They basically said it's a possibility.  
---
That said, if I were a betting man, I'd bet they will have paid server xfers available at some point.  Those existed in vanilla and really its just free money for blizz, so why wouldn't they?
---
Anyway, here is what was said:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exi8yax/
---
&gt;We're considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels. This was available in the original WoW. We'll look at the rules we imposed at that time and also discuss the implications of players moving to a new realm. We believe realm identity is an important aspect of Classic so any guidelines around transfers should support this belief.
---
I'd like to ask about that Whorecraft you mentioned. What is it? Is it actually any good or is it like those pop up browser porn games you get when you go to warez sites.
---
Yeah I kept telling druids that were looking to buy it (over 300g here) that dire maul had a mace extremely similar to it. Probably like 5 of them thanked me for saving them tons of money. BiS lists can be very deceiving
---
If the mage died 5 times he was probably still top damage on the pulls he died unless he's just awful.

Saw 2 in the honestly few runs of UBRS I did. I also have a Staff of Jordan in my backpack which I never ever saw back in the days. RNG is RNG.
---
Only saw 1 Dal'Rends tho
---
Any dungeon after brd just rakes in money, doesnt matter if youre the tank or not, you just need to get lucky. I mean when trash greens are **vendor** for 2-3g its impossible to not make any. Only reason to give up on getting your epic mount is all from your own perception that its impossible.
---
Gratz. Farmed this a hundred times and never dropped.
---
How much a pathetic loser do you have to be to pretend to me your own fan lmao? Eat shit, so glad you didn’t get that dagger, your absolute dogshit
---
what does this mean?
---
I've had less epic world pvp encounters than I hoped, but I've had a ton of amazing dungeon experiences. My favorites have honestly been the struggle runs, a few members might be under leveled, we're completing every quest, and have a couple wipes, but overall everyone is having a good time.

Reserve is the biggest pest we got for classic. Cant Find grps anymore of you need anything at all. And if you do, its a roflcopter suicide cleave. Also dont bring skill and brains, bring High lvl and overated ravager
---
since we are in 1.12 wow most crafting stuff sucks..  It's sad but it won't be changed
---
50g isn't expensive for me but for tanks or sometimes DPS they need to pay 100g total to swap to a pvp spec and then back to a raid spec. That's pretty ridiculous. The timer for the 50g should reset weekly not monthly.
---
Dude, you are a sad, sad loser. I hope you get your life sorted.
---
Oh, I'll def. look that one up. I want to tank. I'm just doing Feral now as I'm leveling. Thanks!
---
It's just strange that anything in vanilla is sacred to the point that people against it dont have a mega to stand on.  This version is not exactly lime vanilla wow, and vanilla wow changed as it went on.  Yes, paid xfers will probably come in, but we still have a leg to stand on to criticize it, since we are paying customers just like you .
---
That's a legitimate thing if they have gear and are using armor consumables. It's pretty meta actually
---
thats going to be completely normal. almost all mc pugs on private servers had boes and recipes and legendaries reserved and no one cares. its gonna be the same on classic
---
Oh? Which one is that?
---
In vanilla you can kite things further if you keep attacking as you run. They go into evade mode if you don't attack back.
---

Pretty sure Medellin is well known with Narcos being this popular. And that logic is... oof

orcs on raptor = cool

anything on undead horse = stupid.
---
don't join if you don't agree....
---
srsly you guys are worse then those wo spent time forming those pugs and want to benefit from it. at least thez do something productive and not complaining..
---
This is... not true. As a rogue you absolutely do not need to use cooldowns to feel ‘broken’, I would say the stun lock is enough tbh.
---
This was very helpful. Thanks! Just made macros for my poisons.
---
And yes , the pure dps build is great for leveling, and I was able to gather enough aggro easily
---
People in Hong Kong are getting beaten and killed in the streets, and seeing too many posts about it is dramatic? I think some things are more important than video games.

That’s the name of one of my Nightborne elves! Blacktarmana lol

Top 5 nostalgia-hits so far for me, was walking into that cave.

Loved hanging out there, randomly, in vanilla.

If that place had a mailbox and an AH npc, I'd be there entirely too much.

Blizzards goal was to make it as vanilla like as possible. Obviously you cannot recreate it exactly. But in terms of making the game as vanilla like as possible, paid transfers fall in line. When I say you don't have a leg to stand on, I mean you don't have a legitimate position beyond it being something you just don't want.
---
Trying to argue for the removal of something that was a core feature is a lot harder than saying don't keep this bug, or don't add this feature that was never in vanilla.

I have not made any addon changes/any updates since last night. This was not happening yesterday but after logging in today I noticed this. I've gone down my list of addons and disabled/reloaded one by one. [Here is a list of my addons](https://imgur.com/nn9sh2o). I have not found anything similar on google and was wondering if someone knew how to fix this.
---
Well yeah I'm not advocating you should be spending +4 stats on a green chest. Personally I used it on my bis until p3 chest for mages. I'm also not saying it's worth it for 10 health and 10 int and a minor boost to crit. Just that for me I can't run around with +3 stats on my chest. Doesn't feel right to me

Its amazing how one can make a "supposed" apology post ., not apologize and make their point in a more nonsensical way and sign off as if they said something meaningful , whole post felt like a fart to me.
---
Its the low hanging fruit, but it also creates a long term problem. Once BC is over, I guess they release Wrath? But all those people saying BC is the best, will start to drop off when Wrath hits. And by the time Wrath is over, most people are of the opinion that classic will essentially be over. So BC offers a low cost, low risk short term option with a clear end date, while classic+ offers a riskier option, that could keep going on...
---
Most people have no idea how to tank in the first place.
---
Ah ya that happened to me yesterday when I updated questie.  In the options there should be a setting to turn off quest icons
---
This is not how you play on PVP servers... It's war between the alliance and horde in classic. I do not approve of this
---
Op. Your a fucking moron.
---
have you done *any* research, at all, about raiding or pallies?
---
I fall for every god damn NE slut even though I know it's a guy on 90%.
---
I feel more jebaited by the "link inside" with no link ....
---
What they do?
---
The only reason I joined was, as I said, because he said "Sellables reserved". If you consider a Tier set, be it BoE, that is obviously going to be an upgrade for most people in the raid, a Sellable then I don't know what to say.
---
For leveling dark pact is fantastic. I was skeptical and it is a lot of button presses but i love having it
---
Is there any way to prevent rogues from stealing STV chest with sap?  Unlike polymorph or rocket helmet, it has no dispel type so restorative potion doesn't affect it, and self damaging with SoID just gives rogue an easy kill since it ticks quite hard.
---
I hate this argument, I see it all the time, people get upset with shit like this because they dumped hours of their real life into farming mats for that shit. It's a big fuck you from the hm, basically he's telling them "the dozens of hours you spent farming mats for this mean nothing to me"
---
Doesn't work that way. IF you reserve say HOJ then only casters will join. Which means that these casters will have to run the instance more often in order to get their loot as the competition in group is bigger as there are only casters in it.
---
they ask another guild for an invite.
---
people really don't give a shit much. just don't give them access to a guild bank.
---
Blizzard didn't make WoW?
---

I laughed when I saw what guild it was. I've grouped with Medellin a few times, and every single time the person gas done something dodgy or scummy. Good riddance to that guild.
---
Not too sound rude but 125g from 40-43 is some bull.
---
I'm a hunter now, mained mage in vanilla, and I was so worried about the stigma I'd get (still there for hunters though). So I'm lovin that mages are THAT class now.
---
Then you will never ever find a tank to Strat Living as zero items drop there for tanks.
---
Literally the entire subreddit is just guild drama and ninja looters
---
Usually people got a pvp and a main char . Most pvp gear doesn't drop in raids, so they just raided with their pve char and sometimes if it was not a progress raid swapped in their pvp char for those drops they needed (sometimes if just for one boss) .
---
Completing the quest is what gives you the transponder. If you have the transponder, you have already completed the only transponder-related quest. If you lose your transponder, Scooty will give you another one.
---
Completing Rig Wars will not affect your transponder.
---
I did happen to see one quest with no exclamation mark, which I accepted and it was actually green. So maybe there is a bug?
---
Everquest looks like a good game.. if it were the early 2000s. WoW's release killed EQ for a reason.
---
Congratulations, you made me mad because of 10 year old lore...bad enough we traded the big bad fortress of the Crusade for a Colosseum, now they also could have some dark edge thanks to the SC members...
---
can sell everything which is BoE, if you dont understand the fine print of a contract you should either ask or not sign it
---
God fuck the badlands. I was farming those elementals and every single skull level horde ganked me while the ones around my level were chill
---
Scarlet MC Taelen Fordring and killed him when the player breaks him free of it.  Also Balnazaar is running a lot of things disguised as a Scarlet leader.  Edit: Not sure why someone went through the effort of putting a downvote on me.  It's the truth and the TC asked.  Balnazar posssed the guy and is a founder of the crusade.  He was previously the ruler of EPL before Sylvanas had him wacked.  So it makes perfect sense that he is ruling EPL in disguise now and probably the one who gave the order to MC Taelen Fordring.  This is stuff is in the game if you just go play classic.

Well I mean if it’s made out of bread it’s probably not a good dog I agree

---
I'm not happy about guilds reserving class drops, but I feel this is fine.
---
 But in the end, if I don't like the loot rules, I just won't join. Just look for another and move on.
---
My honest favorite is when they reserve epics and legendaries too and say “ come get your ony bag!”
---
Like fuck you man I’m not a fucking 🐕
---
it's fucking hilarious he's like 'out of context'.. like holy fuck. There is /no/ context to be had here that doesn't still result in them being shitbags.
---
In all honesty, I don’t know. I am full fury and have only tanked a handful of bosses in MC. I know Rag deals fire damage, but I would think if it was the case that his damage couldn’t be blocked, no one would bother with a shield on him, same with Geddon.
---
I just got shy rotam and his attack speed is 1.5. Not easy to get him. Worth it though 😎
---
Do you play alliance?
---
The title of this link and the post title as well give "headline readers" the impression that your GM (Hamish) is scummy, as if the turdbag officers didn't deserve this retribution.

Also can't help but see your user name as an anagram to the "I'm 14 and this is deep" officer, Nomad.

Finally, good for you Hamish. I hope those filthy nerds get triggered every time they the hammer in his hands.

Just kill people in blackrock mountain :) shadowpriest can kill pretty much anyone 1vs1

just leave

Maybe lol

Thanks for the confirmation

Confirmed shit post.

FOR THE ALLIANCE!

best part is the gm proved that these guys were being piece of shit, reformed the guild and apparently most of the members except for the people he pointed out as pieces of shit.. rejoined.

Good ol blood plague event. Proved to epidemiologists that we are royally fucked with any major epidemic
---
There seems to be a disproportionate amount of posts about ninja/scummy guilds on alliance vs horde. Weird.
---
Just go to blackrock mountain and kill people going to brd/brs :)
---
FYI, the guild members not part of the conspiracy apparently were all invited back immediately
---
They're actually quite good in dungeons and very good in pvp once you have a good amount of gear. Raiding is where they really struggle, similar to ele shamans. The 2 main issues are there mana pool and that your main rotation is adding a shitty dot nobody will want on a boss because of dot cap. That being said we usually have at least 1  meta class, like rogue, fury warrior or frost mage pulling abysmal numbers through a raid so I would take a good boomkin over them any day.
---
Like happy? Bc this is a pretty happy story imho.
---
Players got played, love the timing on his part. Classic
---
I don’t understand the vitriol.
---
You can’t post political views on this subreddit, or the official blizzard forums, and if they had the resources, that would probably extend that to mass chat channels like trade chat in WOW. Blizzard is a business with customers who are all over the world and ideologically different. What was the appropriate response? To do nothing? How does that serve their best interest? 
---
It’s seems like most of you want to have your cake and eat too. You don’t like that a company would choose money over ethics, and yet Blizzard is one of many in a long list of companies that you directly or indirectly support that practice the same trends so many of you adamantly hate.
---
Let me purpose this hypothetical. Let’s say China goes full TS massacre in HK, should the U.S. come to their aid and possibly escalate a war that could go nuclear? I guess my point is that this entire situation sucks. Directing some of the backlash to Blizzard was the correct play, and I am proud of this community for doing the right thing. However, focusing it all on Blizzard at this point is a fruitless effort. If you want to make moves and combat the evil and wrong doing in this world, you need to make a concerted effort to figure out just exactly how involved you are at perpetuating the systems that allow this behavior. I don’t think most of you are doing that. I think most of you are adopting a cause for a quick injection of ‘feel-good-ism’, which is selfish and only serves your own ego.
---
I actually saw Rak'Shiri while traveling through Winterspring and caught him. Sadly I had to let him go again because I had not learned last level bite and howl from that lbrs wolf yet and my other 2 pets were worth more to me (Broken Tooth and Olm the Wise) :(
---
Yes and no. Paladins are the most *efficient* single target healer. However, they're also the lowest throughput healer - which can cause serious issues when they try to solo heal. They also have no tools for AE damage, so in the fights that require a 'healing check' (none really in MC/Onyxia) they're almost useless beyond their class-based buffs/utility.
---
Change your name to Rusty Shackleford.

No. My game isn't a platform for activism.

---
Downvoted for repost. Thanks for your lazy shitpost.
---
&gt;people arent all greedy they still offer tips of their own free will
---
I find that hard to believe. If you give people the option to not pay for a service youre providing, most people will either not pay at all, or pay very little.
---
Youre saying youre trying to be nice, i call bs. Youre spending 5-8 hours a day advertising your enchanting. Are you trying to bullshit people its out of the kindness of your heart? If that were the case you would just be doing enchants for free, no tips period. It looks like youre just trying to find your way in a market with more suppply than demand. You obviously need some gold, and youre just hoping people give you tips, otherwise you wouldnt be wasting your time advertising for free.
---
Yes it sucks that you got muted, thats dumb. What youre doing is also equally dumb. People should pay for everything they buy from anyone with any profession, provided that recipe is rare/expensive. People invest time and money into leveling professions to make gold, not to be a charity. If i need an enchanter i will pay fee, if i need a weapon/item craft i will pay fee, if i need tailoring bags, mooncloth cd, arcanite cd i will pay fee. 
---
I noticed a bunch of other enchanters on razorgore advertising enchanting for free. Thats supposed to make you happy, yes? Youre doing it for free to help the community, theyre doing it for free to help the community. Fantastic, the community wins. You happy about it? If yes, great for you, youre the nicest wow player ever. Are you pissed you now have competition employing your tactics? There you go, youre not doing it to help the community, youre doing it to make money.
---
Is it against the rules/TOS if I suggest my rl friend multiboxes using my account as well as his while I’m at work?
---
Well I hope you have an epic mount or I just can't agree with your prio
---
This is the most hilariously asinine and disingenuous post I've seen, the "average" orb drop per Strat run is 1.5, an "above average" run is 2.5, where the fuck you pulled 3.5 out of is beyond me. At that point you're looking at maximum 40-60g off those drops alone which then translates out to 20/30g per hour, but let's ALSO not forget the part where, let's be generous here, and say it's going to take you 30 min to an hour to form a group where you've literally reserved every orb, so cut that number down, not to mention time to actually all group up and start said run, so another 30min to 45 min, so at this point you're closer to ~10/~20g yield an hour on orbs. Potentially less. The drop rates on said epics are also non-existent not to mention you will absolutely not be the only ones rolling on said items, so the already insignificant drop chance then goes that much lower when rolling against the rest of the party lol. Also not factoring in the "shitter group" factor which then lowers your yield even more when you have to drop group mid run, or if other party members just say "fuck you I'm rolling on the orbs too" and win thus lowering your yield more and making you then A) kick them and wait for a replacement, B) risk losing more, or C) continue with 4 and risk more wipes and a longer clear time and if it's the healer that does it then you might as well call it there lol
---
There's a reason why no one really does cleave anything pre-SM. The dungeons aren't well suited to it, and the kit needed to do cleaves effectively  is still coming together.
---
Patience, but if your shaman brother heals and you pick up a couple more blenders Armory will be a nice grind.
---
I had the +shadow damage neck drop of vectus in scholo. Both mages needed on it T.T
---
No one is trying to do that. People like you can’t even put in the minimum effort and act like everything is complex or every problem is insurmountable because you make it that way. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
---
If more subs took a month off than they gained in China, think it’d put it in black and white for Blizzard to make a pretty easy business decision. It shows people can actually stand up for what’s right instead of the most basic self-interest. 
---
But ho-hum I’m a pessimist, no problems can can be solved by the average person. You’re spitting into the wind. 
---
Can’t wait until a business decides your human rights are the cost. Sure you’ll have the same “thems the breaks” attitude then.
---
This is what retail has created.
---
Beware the rise of the magetards.

One clip, one kill, with a huge gear disparity, with one side getting the drop and using several CDs.

Damn, no hat again.

It was funny, keep it up bro!
---
That is sweet and just what WoW community should be.
---
Spirit tap in groups? Dungeons? Why? Seems like a waste of 5 talent points.
---
There is absolutely no chance of classic + content.  It would be really cool, I wish there was.  But rereleasing TBC would be a slam dunk and there’s no way acti/bliz will pass that up.

Does logging into the game affect the rate you gain rested experience?
---
For example, let’s say scenario A you log out of the game in a capital city at 8 am and don’t log back in until 8 pm. Scenario B you log out of the game at 8 am, but you log in 3 or 4 times during the day for a few minutes at a time to check mail and post auctions.
---
In both scenarios, do you have the same amount of rested experience at 8 pm or do you have less in the scenario where you are logging in more?
---
they kited it through the tunnel in dun murogh? i wanna see the route
---
for some reason acting like my character's a part of groups like the redridge orcs and frostmane trolls was always so fun to me
---
Yes, it's the updated questie add-on. Search the questie settings for Smth that says in game HUD or Smth like that and uncheck it to make them disappear
---
Get it early so it le els up with you.
---
I mean why would you take blackout? If you want to pvp I suppose. But its also a non-raid talent.
---
Spirit tap saves you a ton of water farming satyrs for hours in felwood.
---
Thats another story, thats required for naxx attune
---
Sharing accounts is against the rules so yes
---
What part of “everyone needs gold” don’t you understand?

They do??  I never checked, but I would never have guessed... it's one of my favorite films in that genre.  It has the energy, pacing, and "big" feel of a Michael Bay summer movie, without the smarmy condescension toward the audience and with a better sense of humor.  And it has The Rock, which, by funny coincidence, is also the name of Michael Bay's best film and one of his only non-aggravating ones.
---
I love boomies and would personally choose to bring them along for any dungeon. Furthermore, if a boomkin is bringing full consumes +flask, they really shouldn't run into mana issues in MC. Can't speak for other raids, though.
---
I filled out affliction first, took the lvl 40 talent, then started destruction toward Ruin. When I hit 60 I will respec and take the point out of Pet Tap, but that's really the only time you need to respec
---
If your a shadow it’s extremely viable in your rotation and gets better the higher the rank.
---
THIS guys insane?
---
Pffffft never. Someone so self absorbed is a crazy person?
---
Couldn't see this coming
---
I messed around with a couple of icon settings. The only one that worked was disabling world map icons. So I can still see them on the minimap but not the full map.
---
Warlock isn't a contender for top dps in end game naxx gear. Mages are. While leveling, it's not even close to mages again, but it is up there with hunters (potentially).
---
For leveling yes. For endgame no
---
Classic vanilla

Too obvious, will get tracked down in 48 hours.

Either you escape to a second world country and start a new life as a common man in poverty with five kids or don't even bother! ;P
---
Yes. The only officially sanctioned form of account sharing is between members of the same household. They can see what machine you use to log in with as well as where you log in from physically. If you guys do plan to do this, I would recommend your friend using a VPN to spoof your address when connecting your account so that it appears as if he is in the same household, albeit via a different machine.
---
As long as you are in a rested area when logged in, such as a city, you will gain rested EXP at the same rate as when you are logged out.
---
Open Questie, go to the DBM HUD tab, and uncheck "Show DBM HUD". You can turn your map icons back on.
---
Get your quests out of the way first. You *will* need Tirion's questline, and the first stage involves a lot of mob killing. After that the remaining stages can be completed in any spec. You should probably also start the Hydraxian quest chain to eventually get your douses, the first step involves killing a couple dozen elementals in Silithus and EPL. And check out your faction's Onyxia attunement, though it should be possible to find a group for every stage.
---
On it
---
What a bunch of bullshit
---
The correct answer is that gnomish engineering has some useful BoP items that you must craft yourself.  After you craft these items you completely drop engineering and pick it back up but go goblin the 2nd time to make the goblin items and consumables from then on.
---
So by going goblin without doing this you’re only going to miss the gnomish bop items.
---
If he was GM why didnt he squash the bad behaviour of a few leaders? Weird
---
Account sharing is against the TOS, yes.
---
Man, the point is that when the first epic BoE dropped, everyone was "wait what? those are reserved?" "yes, i can sell it so it's reserved", but we had already cleared 3 bosses by then so no one left at that point. I agree that if the rules are clearly stated, they should indeed get what they deserve. But when things are left out on purpose, I feel like it's just more or less scamming.
---
Honestly it's not as bad as reddit makes it. If this happens and it's not a mage it's  not getting posted or without traction. People want to hate mages right now. So when it's a mage it automatically gets posted and people upvote it.
---
He only lives over the road but fair enough I won’t look into this any further.
---
Technically yes, since account sharing is against the rules. 
---
Realistically, nothing will happen.
---
Its not. It just only gets posted when it's a mage. It's a circle jerk right now.
---
I came looking for drama but instead found love
---
Well that’s why you charge a 25g up front tanking fee.
---
Saying “everything is reserved unless you need it” is grimy because then they can take any boe epics as well.
---
In that case we are in perfect agreement, as Taladril lists the tank/dps hybrid spec with 0/5 feral instinct and 5/5 feral aggression https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/Axw8QATMR_zdATA
---
Anytime!
---
it is.  you can use the word 'stealing' in more ways  than just describing something against a law.  
---
and yes, it's ok if different people use it for different things, you don't have to agree with everybody.
---
Serves you right for being horde scum.
---
There are no guild banks in classic.
---
Sorry, what proof of that are there? I'm seeing exactly no credible source. He was at least part of the plan.
---
I think I looked at the world map a handful of times on my way to 60, typically just by accident. There was never a need. The zone maps I looked at frequently, of course.
---
I think that looks like the admirals hat
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10030/admirals-hat
---
Oh that one again.
---
Lol.
---
So since this is not part of the (invisible) megathread, are we finally allowed to discuss this subject?
---
Mods, has the news cycle died down enough to the point where you can stop removing posts and comments that criticize Blizzard’s decision?
---
I was pondering spirit tap too, but the reason i've decided against it is that you are going to drink after every pull no matter what. You want 30 sec burst, not 5 minutes sustains. When it comes too blackout, it only procs on shadow spells.
---
You aren’t allowed to share an account unless it’s with your parent or legal guardian
---
I assume there will be lots of free action potions chugged and it will be slightly closer than people realize.
---
Instruction unclear, dick stuck in a meat grinder
---
Here’s a thought, why don’t tanks run dungeons like we all do to make money? TADA.
---
It is primarily because you can keep a 1h+Shield in your bags for different situations and the mana talent is hot garbage all of the time.
---
Option 1. 10% hit should be good till like BWL.
---
Yep this is the way things were. They will do this or do blind gold bids at end to hand out, so you have a chance at getting cheaper than AH.
---
Same thing will go with Ony. Head will be reserved or gbid.
---
you get more dps from controlling your pet and using pet dps talents, also improved aspect of the hawk points are worth a lot too. You can keep your pet alive and dpsing in most fights when specced correctly and avoiding melee mechanics with it. The benefit from using peacemaker or lokdelar isnt significant enough to spec surv for % hit. Keep in mind that you dont need warmonger to hitcap for dungeons or raid trash, only for mobs lvl 63 and bosses so you can change weapons on the fly
---
Are you sure his name wasn't John G?
---
This may be a little long. No don't use arcane shot, low dmg and expensive on Mana, where as using aimed shot can pop off some nice hits to make up for the dps Loss whole channeling it. I use a similar build to his but it's in my opinion better. I go with a 4/31/16 build, 6set beaststalker, giant stalker shoulders, mask of the unforgiven, 2x blood slicing hatchets, painweavers band, Blackstone ring, black hands breadth, rune guard trink, and cape of the black Baron no enchants except head and legs, puts my ranged power at 1100 with true shit aura. I currently out dps my guilds hunters and those guys have basically the whole bis list gear, and I out dps them by a lot, even holding back dmg in onyxia fight I can stay easily 6k dmg ahead of them this is not including mongoose pots for an extra 25agil +2% crit chance. I forgot to mention don't use BM, in classic the pets are eh ok and during raids so much aoe going on ur pet will die, BM/MM requires good pet management, great for pvp but not good for end game content until BC expansion.
---
The reason I use a 4/31/16 is for the 1% extra hit from sure-footed to hit cap at 6%. The Intel gives more Mana thus more abils casts, cause hunters have Mana issue in long fight. You can pot but they won't be off cd by the time ur oom, you can FD drink but you will not be fighting so lose even more dps.  the 6set beast stalkers procs about as much as IAOH so it's a decent amount of free Mana coming back thus even more abils and less down time. Hurricane is a tricky bow to learn how to use, to not clip shots. So with a 1.6bow-14% if u have ribblys quiver brings u to 1.37 if AoH procs that's another -30% also decreases aimed shot cast time so now it at a .96 atk spd and for 10 seconds u can pop rapid fire and if life is low enough berzerker for another 60% putting us at a .47 atk spd. Regardless of atk spd learning to weave the aimed shots and multi shots with ur autos is the tricky part. For me base no AoH u want to initiate and let off 2 autos&gt;aimed shot&gt;3 autos&gt; multi shot this rotation will keep u in a constant flow of dps as ur auto shots will release right after if not simultaneously with ur aimed shots and multi shots, at max spd u can release 6 shots before doing an aimed shot this will keep the flow going, and 5 for a multi shot as ur 6th will be an auto. You will get shit for the build, but they all shut up after you spank their ass in meters. I use slower bows for kiting or trash mobs, hurricane for bosses+thorium arrows or doomshots. Trash mobs die quicker so it's more about burst dmg than sustained and when kiting it's single shot high dmg, I suggest just using razor sharp arrows and save the strong ones for bosses, its why slower bows are good for this stuff, but for prolonged sustained dmg hurricane hands down, the dmg pet hits not crazy high, but with a crit chance u criting left and right at high speeds. I can. Pop off 3-4 shots before ur csc let lose one and those shots can crit for 600dmg easily.

**&lt;Classic Clowns&gt;** HORDE EU-Gehennas PVP Casual raiding &amp; PvP
---
We are an English speaking guild and newly formed by a bunch of friends with varied experience from vanilla to current WoW.
---
Goal
---
Our goal is to have a full raid roster to clear the current and future raid tiers and also participate in PvP activities but we are in no way expecting any player to commit 100% of your time to the guild but we are expecting to start clearing raid content with less PUGs as soon as we get a big enough roster.
---
Why Join?
---
We are relaxed and helpful players who can help you with dungeons, questing, builds, raids, professions, pvp etc. We do expect anyone who joins to be 18+.
---
Raid Times
---
2 days a week to be decided once we have enough members.
---
Currently Recruiting
---
Level 50+ as we want to start clearing raid content asap.
---
If you think this guild is a good fit for you don't hesitate to join our discord or DM me!
---

---
Yea, there’s no challenge, sometimes it’s not fun to just be a prick for the sake of it. I usually have to wait for a battle and get some bloodlust then I’ll just kill everyone.
---
Was just thinking that, two posts in a row = arugal drama.
---
That seems to be the consensus yeah.
---
As a tank groups take maybe 15 mins to form if that, and honestly forming a group is semi afk.  It’s just too easy to find scholo/strat groups as most of the loot is garbo for tanks.  You certainly aren’t getting 2.5 stacks of thorium an hour as a tank either.  Killing one level appropriate mob to get to a node can take 45-60s.  Ignoring that, according to your stats strat still wins.  2.5 orbs per run is 50g + 20g vendor trash.  Again, not including truefaith (125g) or flask recipe (100g), and assuming a full 2 hours to form and run, thats still 35g/hour on the low side, which is still much better than 28g/hour.  Not to mention that some people will want to run again if they don’t get what they want which speeds up times.  If someone violates the loot rules then its a kick + blacklist, but you could always use ML if you needed to.
---
How do people like that get so many people in their guild. I can barely recruit and I consider myself to be as fair as possible.
---
Suicide Kings is the best loot system IMO
---
As an hpal I didn't start healing that place until 23. Could have probably done at 22 but still miles ahead of 15.
---
Yep i thought healer was going to be so demanded but after waiting 20 minutes for a tank before literally every dungeon I rerolled as warrior and now I'm living the life of constant whispers and invitations.
---
Wotf.
---
I’ve never needed them and have been playing since 2004 release. Rogue and warrior dps don’t care lol
---
There was a stereotype from way back in the vanilla days that alliance were populated by casual, kiddy players and that only hardcore, rough n tough players were willing to play the uglier, downtrodden horde. They would win a significantly higher portion of battle grounds which cemented this bias, not to mention that they have slightly better PvP racials. Given all this its no wonder that PvP servers have a higher horde pop.
---
Aren't most servers pretty dead during work hours?
---
Yep double arrow. It's exactly the same as the normal scan except quicker. I did exactly the same as you before I went looking for an answer, so no worries. They probably should make that more clear.
---
cute couple 
---
(btw Sanati, find a man who protects you better than this one, who runs away while you are getting mugged by creeps)
---
I call it "Christmas Cave"
---
Kromkrush should be decent for you. 
---
its a centralish server and in Alberta I get 60ms
---
Thanks, I hadn’t thought about it like that before. Could you get away with 3 if you’re a human using swords and have a bit of +def gear?
---
I mean I pugged 6 bosses of mc this week on my 56 priest lol
---
The pity!
---
My friend check de name of the guild and did it. 30 min later he had the ring.
---
You forgot to check warlocks
---
ninja drama was intentionally baked into the game design
---
People will pug aq40 and naxx just like they did on private servers lol
---
What a bad title, doesn't do the original post any justice
---
I think youre missing some key parts of this story.
---
True. But this is in Un’Goro
---
how about using 2 Rivenspike?
---
Im at 130 brd arena-anger-golem runs seen 0 chest and 8 hojs and its not funny anymore
---
Practically everything you just spewed out
---
Bonecrusher from DM will be available this week and is pre-raid BiS

The Scarlet Crusade is, for their part, allied to the Alliance of Stormwind. The Alliance in turn does not actively attack the Crusade although they do not count them as an trustworthy ally. It is we as individual adventurers who attack them for whatever reason motivates us. The Crusade for their part attacks us, even if you are human, because of a justifiable fear of incursion; this relates back to how the necromancers originally infiltrated and infected the population of Lordaeron. Basically if you cannot prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are in fact not a necromancer or agent of the Scourge then you are too much of a threat to be left alive.
---
You have no idea who I am or what my motives are so, unfortunately, this is likely a projection. A hilarious one considering how actually divisive of a comment it is.
---
Good for you.
---
Which is why I made it clear about endgame smh
---
I honestly really like paladin tanks as a priest. I can bubble you for days and you seem to hold aggro better than I expect every time.
---
Yep.
---
This thread is just full of people who don’t know wtf they are talking about
---
Unless you buy your gear I can't see how you can go on from here with mostly stam/int because plate with int is hard to come by, especialy while leveling.
---
If you're gimping your armor and shield absorbs in favor of a higher mana pool I also don't see how your downtime is any smaller if you take much more damage with each hit.
---
I'm prot with strength/stam only at level 41 and don't even have Consecration yet as I went for holy shield first and it works great for holding threat even on 5 mobs at a time. That's also about the maximum amount I can take in a dungeon, after that healers have a really hard time keeping me alive.
---
Thanks for all the lovely comments guys! :) It means a lot when you've worked long on something.
---
If you are interested, there are more videos chronicling Gorak's journey through Classic on my YouTube channel, found here:

---
It’s not. Ask for clarification. Sellables to me makes 100% perfect sense as to what items that entails (anything that isn’t BoP).
---
Fairly certain naming/shaming is also against subreddit/reddit rules
---
I'm not trying to be a contrarian here - but a dps warrior wearing a mix of leather, mail, and plate would have better survivability than a rogue - if we're strictly going off of armor values (which your argument assumes).  Knowledge of the raid mechanics is a much greater factor in survivability, so the armor value a character has is not a factor unless you're tanking.
---
no, you are fine, and  be glad that those people ignore you, you'd probably wouldn't want them in your raid anyway
---
&gt;  I don't have any interest in playing daggers.
---
&gt; What should I do if a perdition's blade (or any other great dagger) 
---
I dont understand your mental puzzle here.. 
---
Are you talking if you already have Viskag's/brutality blade/krol blade? 
---
Because if not thats what your goal should be. 
---
Just like a dagger rogue's need should be perdition blade and core hound tooth in phase 1.
---
:D Thank you! I heard some people experiencing that, so I just had to put it in ^^
---
It shouldnt. Theres a comparable one in DM

I like how the evidence is a haphazardly put together excel spreadsheet and some theory crafting in the discord.
---
I sea what you did there
---
Thanks a lot buddy, I'll try :)
---
I just tell the raid my innervate is my own. Only run out of mana on Rag so far when using consumes.
---
I know that groups for dungeons should be found but chatting and what not (and I don’t mind this process) but is there a chat channel, discord or some other place where people find each other for dungeons? I don’t have a lot of time to play wow so when I do I want to optimise my experience.
---
You basically work for that warrior at that point.
---
This. FAP is the ultimate Mage beater. Otherwise you gotta hope for high burst damage.
---
We really are heroes, aren't we?

The citizens of org “the so called” non heroes are being taxed to death to pay for half. The other half is us letting the goblins basically get away with things like the pollution from their inventions.

You don't have to use reddit 24/7 to use the search function

I think there’s a fair argument to be made if you’re absurdly geared, but for the most part I’ll just look for another tank, we all need money.
---
Bruh.
---
post your logs
---
If you die vs a mage you're doing everything wrong.
---
They have a pretty low drop rate. Took me quite a few runs to get them for my Breastplate of Bloodthirst.
---
Just run UD at least once every time you log on and you'll get it eventually.
---
Haha that's great. I'll have to check out the other videos.
---
Same goes for sharpening stones, which you only use on OH in raids (on warrior).
---
This makes me happy
---
Thunderfury bindings are perfectly fine to reserve.  That is not PuG stuff, anybody wanting those makes sure they are a core raider of an established guild themselves , because that is the only way you will ever get them.  (and even then chances are low)

Yes it does. He probably also changed the rarity

Wow that sounds like the dumbest fucking shit I've ever heard in my life.
---
As a healer, my negative experiences with mages (and really any DPS) aren't related to their spell rotation, it's a general lack of understanding of threat dynamics and dungeon basics. So, couple basic tips:
---
i) If you AoE before the tank has a chance to build any threat on the adds, they'll head straight to you. As a healer, if this happens constantly it's annoying as it's a big drain on mana and therefore the group's efficiency.
---
ii) If you have other Mages in the group and your AoEing a lot, take turns using nova to keep the adds away from you for as long as possible. Whisper them and work out who will take the first nova, the second, etc.
---
iii) Always wait for the tank to group up mobs before DPSing.
---
iv) If you're not AoE'ing, target the tank's target to minimise the chances you'll aggro the mob. Using a focus macro is a great way to do this.
---
v) If you do aggro a mob, move toward the tank, not away from them so they can taunt it off you.
---
As an undead, I enjoy the face eating
---
Didn’t say per run mate
---
i wish it was old news, some people don't even know downranking is a thing or are completely oblivious to mana pots.
---
I dunno, I like some of the features of auctioneer but I do feel like I need a phd to understand what I’m looking at on most extra pages
---
Imagine willingly giving up on third of the content because you never want to see the other side.

I’d say it’s good to experience the “other side” at least once.
---

But he also fucked over every other guild member in the process by disbanding the guild and guild discord.  Why didn't he just gkick the offending members?

Ah okay i get you. Thanks

What about in the second scenario?
---
Immediately reminded me of two particular characters in hxh
---
&gt; Both pale in comparison to DW Fury though.
---
Not really. Horde 2H is actually very good. Not as good as DW, but certainly not far behind.
---
Thats not what a downvote is for. Downvote is not disagreement.
---
Didnt realize that thanks.  That's helpful.  Although,  the orange/blue raptor and purple warhorse all looks awesome.  If I was Male orc the warhorse would look dumb but female can pull it off
---
2 months at most.
---
To think you possibly didn't go druid because of an antiquated 15 year old notion angers me.
---
I'm 59 with a 22 belt on still. Nothing ever drops
---
thats what Im saying
---
You could pick up a Mass of McGowan off the AH and use mirah's OH until you get the MH dal rend's, it's a pretty solid combo.
---
I've run ZF a few times with a party of 4 mages.
---
Aside from the wipes we had because of bad coordination it was pretty smooth, but also quite boring.
---
The def won't be the issue, bigger issue is being able to hold threat. If party members don't consistently rip aggro from you its doable. But then again, what are the odds of that? Hueue
---
What usually happens is, they ask you to come despite being underleveled, then shit on you for not being able to hold aggro when they're the ones that should watch their threat.
---
Thought you are an idiot because of the bruh, but then i saw he started it when complaining.

TIL this sub allows gore

Patcherk is as overrated as most people overrated early clears of MC in Classic.
---
I feel so bad for anyone unironically thinking DKP is a good system to handle loot.
---
You don't lose AoE by being fury. Fury has better sustained AoE. The only thing arms has is sweeping strikes. Fury has better cleave damage, overall damage, and rage generation (which translates to more, harder-hitting cleaves).
---
If you aren't 60, you will 100% be doing more damage in AoE as fury. It's not even close.
---
History is written by the victors.
---
You can start a pug raid without reserves. I bet more people would join instead to the reserved one.
---
I beat a 57 warrior in a duel with my 29 Twink hunter back in classic. Granted he was a potato but concussive and Serpent sting didn’t resist a ton in og classic either
---
Yes it's very good. You have less Hit Cap requirements, and for a raid, less competition over a small number of drops. But it begins to fall behind a bit by the time Naxx hits. :)
---
Some guy said I was blacklisted by his entire guild, when I messaged someone else in the guild they said they didnt even know who that guy was
---
A lot has changed since 2004 and one of them is everyone thinks they're some hot shit twitch streamer.
---
Rofl no, both hunters and rogues want double DM ring rofl
---
ah ok
---
Thing is I don't play that much (pretty much only on weekdays a few hours a day) so the passive Mooncloth gold (about 4 gold a day for me) is actually pretty good.
---
Plus I heard that tailoring will still be useful later for Zul'Gurub crafts. I guess my question is what's better, herbing or skinning now that I'm approaching endgame.
---
Fucking gold.
---
&gt; But it begins to fall behind a bit by the time Naxx hits. :)
---
lol
---
Wym? 100g/hr is without world BoE or AH drops. What part of that farm is unreasonable? Won't work now on my server cause small rads dropped to 2g40s but while it lasted it was amazing.
---
So you agree they're objectively and obviously inferior and don't see any issue with that,  fantastic
---
Haha that was a good way to start my day. Good job mate.
---
wtf? This should not happen
---
Lawful evil is using the system to benefit you as much as possible. However, they still favor that system as it allows them to profit and hold power in the future. Destroying that status is definitely a chaotic move.
---
Humar got 1.3 AS so its not a bad alternative. If youre min/maxing then you might as well get BT. But ima stick with humar, just because hes cool
---
I've yet to find any cross-faction translations that work reliably beyond a handful of meme phrases, so I don't think it's an issue.
---
So my phase 1 BiS slot (from wowhead) for resto shaman shows the Corehound Belt as BiS. However, from my understanding, the plans for Corehound Belt aren't available until phase 3. Is Thorium Brotherhood getting rewards added in phase 1.5 (Dire Maul) or is wowhead incorrect?
---
Why would you assume everyone else in strat live runs for gear? I run for money, orbs specifically. I have no problem forming groups with tanks who don’t reserve things. 
---
Every person I know is leveling a tank right now. Trust me when I say we will see more tanks I’m the future. 
---
It’s 100% entitlement.
---
Oh for real? Even single target dps ?
---
Found one of the idiots that donated to the cult.
---
Lucky you. Maybe your server has more tanks. My server is consistently out of tanks. Every single post in all of those chat windows that you mentioned is LF Tank when it's prime time.
---
So if someone leaves the group while you are deciding if you need then you are no longer allowed to loot?
---
He wasn't the main guild-leader, only a co-leader.
---
Most of that stuff seems pretty tame compared to what I’ve seen in dota. Hell, our PROFESSIONAL players have done shit like that; ritsu with the death threats and I’m sure many other casual ones slung by pros, all the pros with the n word/other slurs (Russian whores, monkeys, etc), the like 5 people that have had to make public apologies for being fucking racist in games (professional and pub)x breaking items and running it down mid, pros talking shit about one another and “blacklisting” them from teams. I know soda and reckful had their edgy days (if you consider them wow pros) but these guys are ridiculous; and this is all from the last couple of years. Going further back and it’s WORSE. 
---
However YMMV; what I’ve experienced from other dota players rivals things that I’ve never experienced from any other game
---
Idk where my sarcasm implied I felt accused I think you might need another reading comprehension course m8
---
I prefer Dive's Drain Tanking guide. It is so much fun to chain kill without stopping to drink or eat often. It pretty much goes against that entire video, and Dive actually provides evidence of the math unlike the above video where we have to blindly trust his 25 days played. Like what others have said, play what you think is fun.
---
Its not close to bis for hunters. Blackhands + hinterlands quest one is way better
---
I’d say your fine. The only thing I can think of is if your “guild” was like less than 15 people in the run. But I don’t know where that line from guild ran pug just becomes a pug.
---
noggenfogger?
---
3% drop chance, worth it
---
This isn't how it's going to work. You need to realize that the only reason tanks run strat live is for the money since no warrior gear drops in it. 
---
You can either deal with it or you can sit spamming in lfg for 2 hours. Orb res runs are here to stay. 
---
Only retail babies get mad at this.
---
the boys over on the [Off-meta discord](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG) are making breakthroughs on this type of playing.
---
Nah I just think people aren’t utilizing their resources as much as they could. Had to show a guy how to use more channels than general chat.
---
Stop spreading lies man wtf? Have you heard about fucking sweeping strikes?
---
That guy is smoking some serious shit, fury has way less aoe you lose out on sweeping strikes that's massive.
---
Seems one side is always full of moral and nice people and the other with “pretty and silly” character designs that attract the worst people.
---
So what’s the rotation for arms talented warriors at mid lvl?
---
I googled around and think I’m ok w tanking. Since prot talents are a no no apparently at lower  levels 
---
What about dpe arms? Idk what to hit beside heroic strike and some of the other buff/rebuff abilities
---
His post states the inner clique spread themselves amongst the different raids to avoid rolling against each other and also stacked their raid to make it go super fast while the other 2 raids were stuck taking much longer.
---
These 2 points seem completely contradictory. That in addition to them having proof and his actions not helping the people he was allegedly concerned about, I don't believe his claims at all.
---
o siema
---
Addon named BlizzMove but the position won't be saved last I used it. MoveAnything should work too but for some reasom I couldn't get it to. Check these out on willitclassic.com
---
I would wait until diremaul comes out to decide between skinning and herbalism. we still don't know which two are best for aoe farming diremual east. Most likely it will be herbalism but better to wait.
---
I guess the passive gold isn't bad for tailoring for you, and yes with ZG release you would have to level it up again.
---
Oh, look, as typical, it was Alliance.
---
If you're talking about solo aoe grinding mobs the best gear is pieces with int/stam on them since blizzard has very low spellpower scaling.
---
Stalagg alliance. Wednesday and Thursday they were 4g each and I have no  idea why. I guess everyone wanting their fiery enchant for alts. Farmed for 8 hours each day and now I'm sitting at just under 2k gold.
---
Atlas Maps looks amazing but I couldn't get any addon to work with Classic.
---
Underrated comment xD
---
I think people just value their own time than they do the time spent from others. Rarely is it a group effort to do whatever everyone needs, it's always "this is what I want, dont care what you want very lucky to be here" attitude from players, moreso with tanks. Just my experience.
---
Yes. During the day, most servers are relatively dead since most people are at school/work.
---
Makes for some nice quiet/uncontested farming, for people like me who work afternoons/evenings.
---
They weren't freedom fighters trying to liberate their fellow guildies they were terrorists!
---
the part with the letter from retail was my fav
---
And its objectively worse, that weapon is the nuts for warriors.
---
Im not at 60 and i agree with you but let me point out what came to my head: lets say someone waits until you clear a hard camp.. took you 10 minutes to do it without dying. Random guy comes over and loots the chest you were aiming for. Now let me separate things.. one thing is when its just about loot, i mean lets say 2 guys have same dkp and one loses roll over the other and gets manchild because of it.. thats really bad. Now if someone intentionally fucks you over and you dont get any loot.. im not saying people should go mad over this, but it happens. You worked hard someone comes.. someone that knows that you worked hard for it.. and just "steals" or take it without really "deserving".. getting mad over something like this id acceptable in my point of view because its not about loot per se.. but because human conduct.. its not about fairness either because life isnt fair.. but about conduct. Some people are bad human beings and sometimes this gets us
---
Two high lvl rolls that are also a draw... and he won both
---
same
---
Hire me pls
---
What lies are you talking about?
---
Did you see
---
&gt;The only thing arms has is sweeping strikes.
---
???
---
Can’t wait to gank my own faction with this
---
There are point systems that avoid problems like that 
---
For the vast number of guilds that aren't at the bleeding edge of progression, loot council just leads to loot drama.
---
It is his choice to do it for no money, that's not against the rules at all. The only rule violation is reporting someone for chat abuse when they aren't abusing chat.
---
Wow what a dick move by that one guy. The EVE player in me approves.
---
Fury is much better single target, and much better if you're aoe tanking dungeons, especially while leveling.
---
Enrage alone is far superior to sweeping strikes, lol. And that's completely ignoring more rage, deathwish, stronger cleaves, etc.
---
I've been poly'd at at least a dozen times while I have grounding totem out it definitely doesn't work. 
---
Must be the brain damage half this sub has for thinking I'm wrong.
---
I love the old comments, because half of them are rage posts about people stealthing and saying it easy. "LOOK WE GET ITS EASY FOR ROGUES BUT IF YOU DONT GIVE DETAILS WE CANT DO IT." So funny.
---
Those people were probably holding onto the mats up till it was time to make the hammer. Had he just kicked them they would have gotten away with the mats. He had to get the mats from them he had to be the one to make the hammer so that they would trade him the mats
---
If he hadnt actually donated, the organisation wouldnt have made him an ambassador.
---
Imagine taking some acid when visiting this cave.
---
This post made me laugh way too much in public.
---
And her panties!?
---
Meh. I do this as a BiS feral tank except I advertise quick runs.
---
I did the first orb reserved thing but what do you do when no orb drops? It happens about 1/3 of the time and now I wasted 30-40 mins making next to no gold and no items of use.
---
So I make groups reserving all the orbs now and it averages to 1ish a run, since not all runs want to do canonneer.
---
Groups still fill fast AF.
---
Ive been farming ironfoe and this is depressing as fuck. I'm so sorry.
---
I am obviously not talking about the Asian player's stance. I'm talking about China suppressing fundamental human rights one being freedom of speech.
---
Your explanation is common knowledge. But the thing is, Blizzard is expressing a lot of political views, one example is their support of the LGBT community. But as soon as it comes to political stances threatening their relationship with a totalitarian Government who are against human rights. THAT is what I'm talking about. THAT is greed prioritised over standing up for fundamental human rights. An "American" company not wanting to stand up for American values.
---
You must not have seen the other post.
---
Back in the day I specced into deep DPS holy with a mix of naxx and bwl gear and found it wholly underwhelming.
---
It's probably not worth it versus other farm opportunities.
---
Is there any video evidence of someone getting d/c'd due to mass reporting?
---
Congrats man. Enjoy your runs. But that other raid did absolutely nothing wrong, you just don’t agree with it.
---
Hand of rag is the best 2hand fury weapon though :O
---
depends on phases, aq40 was better for horde imo, shamans were great
---
Probably you whisper your offer so no one knows what everyone else is bidding
---
People who reserve items are scum, lol. Get a guild or some friends you twats.
---
Dwarf is best at everything, because beards.
---
incendosaur are pretty good to far in the cave in searing gorge, do won’t be great at your level though

Also I'm not talking about passing on a 2% upgrade, you know exactly what I'm referring to but I'm now guessing that you're someone who holds all their dkp.
---
How do I make it show a threat meter?
---
They said that at the end of their comment though, that it hits hard yada yada. It's also bugged and does to much damage rn
---
Warrior.
---
Somewhere I read that spec isn’t really viable until 500+ agi so seems like a 100% dps loss now.
---
I've read somewhere that the cut off is level 30. After level 30 it saves the chars name for a number of days (15/30?) so you wouldn't be able to use a second account to take the name.
---
Take an item like Ony head. Everyone interested will private message master loot how much gold they are willing to spend on it. Highest bid wins. 
---
Can’t compare or go 1g more like you would in live chat. Makes it a little more fair, but can also be costly if you feel you have to bid high.
---
That's just your guild leader being shit at the game.
---
All the domo adds will periodically put on a spell shield which reflects all direct spells, this includes polymorph. That means they cannot be sheeped doing this time. If they are already sheeped before this, then they will continue to be sheeped though. So just make sure you reapply sheeps before the shield and you are good to go.
---
He's not trying to farm multiple.  He just wants 1...
---
&gt; Theres a reason they're known as oomkins
---
You do know there's no such thing as an oomkin, right? you would need to play very poorly to go oom.
---
Warriors are one of the best dps and the best tanks.
---
Really enjoy using voidwalker right now as a 19 warlock.  Should I be buying any Grimoires? Or am I good?
---
Respect, I do the same out in the world. When it comes to mining or with mobs I’ll always help a dieing warrior or try and communicate with a mining nodes. /salute. 
---
Unless ofcourse they or in my KoS then heh..they did my dirty.
---
If you have a bad loot council maybe.
---
If you’re going to play a game with high ping, you could do a lot worse than WoW.
---
Jesus. That would be very brutal. Maybe I should just stick to retail and have my personal loot a my bonus roll.
---
You only need one point in most skills. The ones I'd level are heroic strike, mortal strike, battle shout, demo shout, rend (though its not necessary, but its nice), sunder armor and execute. Charge too I suppose
---
Seems like an easy name to ignore and put on your blacklist.
---
Sounds like a bunch of asshats. Corrupt officers lead by a chaotic neutral irresponsible gm. They deserve each other. 
---
Feels for the many raiders taken advantage of.
---
Wait, aren’t we the Grobb Gang?
---
Wait, youre a student and CEO? Damn..we live in confusing times!
---
Dale?
---
on a side note if you’re stuck on a FP and wish to get off, above your action bar there’s a little red undo-looking arrow. It will cancel your flight and drop you off at the next FP.
---
You can sac void walker while stunned, so I don't see how you can die in the opener
---
Well, the propellers on the zeps are powered by gnome slaves on dreadmills, if you've ever wondered by goblins are always smiling.
---
Yep, garbage build until like naxx
---
Imagine loot counciling on retail with higher stakes, no class specific pieces, each class having 3 specs with different stat priority, different classes fighting over the same azerite for different reasons. Loot Counciling Classic is 100% easier.
---
guilds actually trying to be the best wont charge people for making consumes lol.  theyd even prob have a couple officers making the consumes to give out and just have people do something else or take boes to sell.  guilds doing that want faster runs or one shots not server firsts or seconds etc.
---
I was really worried that the orc that was sharing the apples gonna get smacked by the angry orc.
---
This is something I worry about. I want to run a 31/5/15 build at end game, so I can have some decent tanking and dps abilities, but I know the MS debuff is a big no-no for raids.
---
Classic horde response
---
Satisfying :D
---
Rule 1 violation ffs
---
Both spots were full of Horde when I was doing the quest. Checked both spots four different times and gave up until I had time to play in the morning before work.
---
time to get over it, people
---
Why did he wait instead of just exposing them and kicking them? You act like he didn't have the power to kick or fix this before then.
---
Half are warriors? That seems like a problem.
---
You only need to train the abilities you use. 
---
You're stuck with the chicken until you get exalted with another faction, which won't happen before 40.
---
Playing rogue in PvE is like flying on a superjet across a cycle lane. This class is just designed to be played in PvP, so many nuances and so much fun there, whereas in PvE it’s just a warrior copycat swinging swords and pressing one button, so I guess you should rather choose warrior.
---
But no girlfriend
---
What server? Cause I just /who and there is a lvl 34 mage with that name...
---
&gt; I don’t understand the vitriol
---
it's something new for people to complain about
---
10
---
I am a boomkin and i top dps meter all the times in scholo,brd and strat. They are underrated, you are right that they are not wanted but they are useful.
---
Doing the math, bloodthirst would do more damage than mortal strike anyway... Only real reason I'm so deep in arms is for the 2H and axe specialization.
---
DKP is a garbage system that rewards hoarders and people that suck but have perfect attendance. If you cant trust your guild with loot council why are you raiding with them
---
Dope tabard
---
Works fine for me
---
If only this post existed a few days ago when this exact scenario happened to me as a Rogue.
---
It's funny and unexpected sure, but the only real option is to Hearthstone home and make the whole trip back to BRD if you don't have a Warlock that can summon.
---
So majestic in the wild
---
Your account is your email not your account name
---
I'm uninformed on this subject. What happened since it reset? Is it the hunter quest requiring you to solo the mob?
---
Man if you have void walker out that's extra 10% on the 30%.  Plus you also have to consider demon armor and your cloth armor which is another 15%.  So yeh thats 55% base melee mitigation,  good luck taking down a lock lo.
---
Man this really is quite pathetic, if you're going to be a greedy asshole at least be one for something that matters.
---
Tooltip, bottom right.
---
New player here. What exactly am I looking at.
---
Thats how it was in Vanilla. it was a lot easier to disappear too. There wasn't youtube or reddit.
---
How can i assign scroll wheel up and down to do certain things? I want to change battle stances using them.
---
How is he stealing 5%? In a guild run, you don’t see any of those mats. BoEs are rolled for but no one is making gold off these in a guild run. Bindings are always reserved for the tank. Recipes are usually handed out to an officer with the profession. Even BoE greens just vanish unless it’s something oddly good like “of Frozen Wrath”. 
---
Where is this 5% that I’m gaining in a guild run? Only difference for most people, you roll for BoE epics in a guild run. But even then, most guilds will hard reserve or loot council certain items. That would happen in the PUG raid that’s being described. 
---
I’ll pass on BoEs for my chance at OEB, or spinal reaper, or cauterizing band, or Ony Head, or ToeP. All of those usually have some restriction in a guild run where as a PuG does not.
---
"You don't know me, but I know you"
---
Yea don't offend people's sensibilities. WTF is wrong with you?
---
Yeah thats probably what they meant now you mention it because my raid literally runs 3 hunters 4 max where as we have like 6 mages and like 5 locks so that would make sense to me.
---
Yes, you're wrong. You're relying on them to come in and do the kills you can't do alone, but you don't want to allow those players to have an equal shot at the best loot.
---
If you want to reserve items for certain people, run with a full guild group. If you can't get a full guild group, then you don't get to reserve items.
---
Macros like this don't work on the retail client.
---
Not sure if you guys have been leads before, but being a Guild Leader is significantly different than being an officer or member.
---
The amount of stuff you put up with can get hectic.  And the fact his officers/leads were plotting against the GM AND the Guild, 'controlling' anything is out of the question.
---
I think he did right as best as he could. 
---
Screw them up and the last step when he realized what was up. 
---
Burn the old banner. 
---
Raise a new one without them.
---
Even distribution of gear to the entire raid in a way that stops fuckbois in shit gear saving points for perds is the dumbest shit you ever heard in you life? Have fun sucking off a gm so you can get your upgrades first
---
It really shouldn't be taking you twice as long, it should only be about 1.5 times if that, you also shouldn't be going DPS gear because you don't gain a ton of damage compared to survivability loss
---
So you're saying that out of the thousands of top guilds in the world who have raised naxx on private servers you're the one out liar where locks out dps warriors rogues and mages? Interesting.
---
5 minute cooldown.

Me: Frost mage, Gnome, level 43 - I had this great idea to go to the Hinterlands and get the hammer for Zul'Farrak. I wanted to know if I can kill Qiaga - turns out wasnt a good idea, but I tried it anyways. A couple minutes into,  an Orc -  Warlock lv48 crossed my way. He had the same plan, I sheeped the other Big elite for him and he managed to kill 51 Elite Qiaga, while I got aggro of the add and got killed.
---
I thought myself - maybe he waits to help me either. I ran to my corpse, resurrected, watched out for him, but he wasnt here anymore. I sat down to regenerate. AND then, he appeared and gave the sign to attack Qiaga &lt;3
---
this was so freakin awesome.
---
Yeah, you have to take them solo. If someone gets involved they either one shot you or in this case despawn
---
The best is just to roll the loot in moste guilds, just use smart restrictions for certain classes.
---
Thank you so much! So basically re spec fury and keep using 2 hander until I start getting my hit gear? 
---
Also we have 5 or 6 warriors, and only about 15 people that’ll be 60 anytime soon, so I suppose it’s not terrible but still kind of an issue
---
You’re way overreacting to this. It isn’t an asshole move to reserve things if you are creating a raid. Grow up.
---
Wow what a travesty. That mage needs blacklisted on your server...
---
teremus is commonly used for this because his reset radius is so big its basically infinite
---
lol did he say "yikes" for real?
---
He likely paraphrased it and removed the actual names.
---
That or this is all made up for our entertainment.
---
Well I mean someone without a guild won’t get too far on Thunderfury with no means to get the mats + kill the boss unless they have gold cap+ and buy everything including help
---
And the commenters here eat it up. Like his manifesto is some holy book.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/) 
---
It's literally not.
---
He is the reason in am not playing classic. Sure not everyone do this in this manner, but to get your gear you have to act like this in some way. Do you really think you will be not hit by something like this first or later? Fool.
---
Lol having reddit just means every server hears about it. Shit like this was regular fare on realm forums.
---
I like this.
---
The guild I’m in Has been pugging 10-15 spots remaining for ony and MC. 2 item limit. MS roll priority over OS. We usually give mats to the guild. Nobody has ever complained and annoyingly somehow the pugs always get better rolls, which is bad for our guild. 
---
If anything guilds should be more strict, alternating between everyone and guild only etc.
---
Well the chest with +4 stats he’s asking for 15g AND mats. 10g AND mats for Crusader isn’t that great considering tipping shouldn’t be mandatory in general. I always tip but if you’re telling me I have to tip a certain price for an enchant, I’ll go find someone else.
---
Its true, hes taken control of dozens of peoples entire lives, selling everything they own and tricking them into living on his compound. He believes he has invented a new way of thinking that he calls "logic", which unites quantum and classical mechanics as well as answers every possible question. He is unable to explain how this works, while at the same time claiming every scientist and philosopher supports him.

It depends. You are Horde you sure were evil in their eyes, but you just made it for survival of the Forsaken. If you are Alliance, like me, you probably had two thoughts thay are in my head all the time:
---
1. Why didn't we captured Scarlet Crusade leaders, brought em to Stormwind and showed that not all humanity is lost? We could show that they can abandon their path of self destruction, of turning against the whole world.
---
2. When does she drops that chapeau to my resto druid?
---
Moar dots...
---
So they are looking for a tank who doesn't want the orb reserved?
---
You deserve platinum. Good shit dude
---
Never said this was a good farming guide just said I made this money on my server. 4x5x4g = 80g.
---
Never joining any group with anything reserved. Don't agree with the idea.
---
I kinda wanna join you lol
---
Is SW really deserted? I'm rarely there but IF is almost always filled with people.  We're definitely horde heavy but alliance population is high too
---
Loot council is an obvious bad system designed for favoritism
---
Fans didn't want loot trading in dungeons for another reason beyond #NOCHANGES. Loot trading in dungeons allows you to have friends in the dungeon roll on BoP gear against the other person who needs it and then trade the item to your friend. I honestly think that would have been way less rare than a person accidentally rolling need on an item they didnt mean to.
---
Heartseeker is like super imbalanced. Like alliance outweighs horde 4:1 lol
---
Did Blizzard change the servers/population? For the first time in weeks I have a really long queue (80 minutes) and in the server list, there is the statement "Layering". What does this mean?
---
It's hilarious how entitled some new WoW players are. Some people seem disgusted at the idea of DKP.
---
Then why you respond to me lol? r/okaybuddyretard

Using X to do achieve Y is not the same as Y natively existing

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhdse5/any_players_from_vanilla_play_alliance_on/).

Wasnt Whitemane herself the victim of some sort of mind warping insanity curse?  Renault was a jealous little shit though.
---
The support classes are still helpful I guess I meant only viable for killing
---
Senjin villiage?
---
Our guild is full of adults with jobs wife’s kids. It’s about making it easier not about making it useless.
---
It’s a really good set....
---
What do you mean rewards hoarders? While others hoard you get 'lesser' loot almost for free.   
---
Also it's hard to suck in Classic, also -dkp for not being prepares or doing major fuckups is also a thing.
---
Yeah but the issue is youre making it sound as if its something others can do. Like, many people farmed their epic mounts on that first week because they were first to get the high level mats for example, you cant do thatoutside of that first week or so as the server catches up.
---
I still have mine some where in a box
---
Because responding and asking questions are 2 entirely diffrent things...
---
Okay ^^
---
i dont find it for classic sadly :(
---
Awesome info - thank you!
---
and I think /u/Cold94DFA is saying that with the need before greed system the item is auto bound to you if you roll need. This way the person isn't ninjaing to sell it and is forced to use it. Of course this doesn't work if you want a different set of loot rules, but you'd hardly call that person a ninja.
---
Where the fuck are you coming from mate saying tipping shouldnt be mandatory but still expecting people to shell out hundreds of gold on the rarest recipes? How does that work in your eyes? You pick mining/engineering and expect everyone else to service you for free?
---
I mostly feel bad if I have to kill someone lol
---
they're terken er derps!
---
Except you could have just dropped group and ignored him after his first “bruh” comment and gone on your own way.  You dug in looking for a fight in chat with the reply.  No better than the bruh dude imo.
---
Azuresong is pretty Alliance-heavy. I don't know about streamers, though since I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing.
---
Yungdaggerdick.... quality name
---
Imagine the smell.
---
its not a tip then. its a fee. its also a very rare enchant so its fine. no one on my server even has +4 stats yet.
---
fish up essence of water, DM jump runs soon
---
I'm only 38 but I've only been killed in pvp 3 times. 
---
2 were ??'s and the other time I got double team by a pally/rogue that had to pop bubble and vanish to kill me. Then I came back hid and got my succy back and managed to 2v1 them after. 
---
I've killed plenty of hunters without dropping below 90%. Ive 2v1d like 3-4 times and killed plenty of people solo without issue.
---
You don't block spam?  It was literally spam not a discussion or even a sentence just spam.
---
"Vegeta"
---
No one has been killed. One teenager was shot after being warned the cop would open fire but he didn't die. From memory one person died by committing suicide a few months ago and had nothing to do with the police. What are you smoking? As for beatings, let's be honest here, the cops in America would do way worse if they had bombs thrown at them.
---
The misinformation is mind boggling.
---
The issue is, you have no idea who is doing what outside the raids. Neither do I. Personally I'm happy when a player who is the heart of the community, helping others get the prebis after they need nothing, providing consumables for others, being a stable and decent human...gets LC'd items over someone who raidlogs but has less RL issues to balance.
---
Nah. Player dependency is what drove me to quit Classic.
---
&gt; in the server list, there is the statement "Layering". What does this mean?
---
It means that there's 2 "layers" - like two servers, but with same chat. And if you join party with player from another layer, you would be moved to that layer as well.
---
Bet you feel proud af you finally hit 60 for the first time
---
You cannot block Geddon, it makes him an ass, but you can block Ragnaros, I thought it was weird but you can, pure fire damage but can be blocked. Tanks wear leather for rag at times because of FR BiS and armor doesn't matter vs him.
---
Best cult leader too btw.
---
So this had to go through Black Rock Mountain?
---
DAMN PEGGY
---
Once you go raptor you'll be happy thereafter.
---
They *used* to be mushrooms until they got a 2min cd deathcoil and a soul link that can’t be purged. Now they’re OP.
---
He's certainly nailed the cult leader look.
---
Lol yeah tomato tomato.
---
Chaddy asf!
---
Depends on the leader, ive had leaders in absolute control and ive had leaders that are door mats. Theres also a good balance between door mat and absolute control as well where you encourage original thought and throwing around ideas but also are confident in leading and making the right decision.
---
Disbanding the guild without telling anybody seems shady.
---
So I don't have all the details here, but, if everything is as some here said, then this seems... *really* stupid. Like I would seriously question why I'd want to come back to a guild with a leader with such poor decision making. 
---
How about this: Have a serious talk with the people who are being assholes, and if they don't change, kick them. 
---
There's either more to the story or the GM is simply not fit to be in a leadership position if he can't confront people and put his foot down.
---
I mean look a lot of people don't like confrontational situations like that (I don't either!), but if you're a leader, sometimes you have to deal with that. 
---
If you let others do whatever the fuck they want to the point where you feel your only choice is to disband and remake without them, then you're not a good GM and are not made for that position.
---
I first played RS from ages 10-13. At 13 i jumped to WoW then i switched to RS and WoW on and off.
---
Theyre both games where you can just forget all around you and have continues progress in your character. Also WoW has their own Grand Exchange as a reference.
---
Who the fuck told you that?
---
Yea, 2 hander for starter. Using imp cleave over imp slam since you'll most likely not have the rage generation to reliably have enough for it and keeping BT/WW on CD for a while. 
---
5 or 5 warriors are to be expected, solid DPS throughout classic, popular and in high demand. I wouldn't worry unless there's 10+ warriors each raid.
---
Sure did about 15 years ago on my warlock! That 1-60 was the best 6 months of my life.
---
Any high pop PVE or RP server.
---
Depends who you play with. DKP is much more broken, just in different ways.
---
i know, but now you have best time, imo. You can choose what to do - grind mobs, do simple quests or go dungeons. And later u wont have any choices - just raids(dungeons). Which is sad, cause sometimes you want just nobrain grind mobs or do simple quests. But cause you wont have simple quests anymore and cause u are max level there is less reason to grind mobs - you forced to do 2h dungeons and long raids :( and nothing to do for like 30 min or 1h free time...
---
Selling your tanking or healing is a crazy good way to make money. I (shaman) and a warrior tank friend did a few runs of Live Strat and we reserved everything that wasn't an upgrade for the dps. We averaged 30g per run just vendoring things, and one of the runs was almost 300g because pattern, BoE blue, and 4 orbs.
---
Yup, it was a bit hard like those are real connections you end up making. Luckily I joined another guild and met my SO, that was 5+ years ago, he did me a favor!
---
In lights hope it is only the guards on the horses that attack
---
people like him are basically why I'm going to end up quitting classic.
---
for now, I'm enjoying leveling, so I am leveling 5-6 different classes now concurrently (not multi-boxing, but you know).
---
I am convinced that based on my life and playing time, I just can't see me enjoying level 60 at all. Even with a good guild.
---
No, it's quite easy, that was part of the appeal of the game in the first placf.  May be easier now, but the game was never hard or challenging as people are making out.
---
Healing isn't directly correlated with gear/stats, especially on such short fights where that 2k mana is completely overkill. For DPS I can totally see it being around 19% increase, but with guilds clearing it in ~1:30 with no consumes, that's not going to save much time considering how much of that is just running back and forth.
---
And even if it was an hour, what's the point? You spend 1h less in raid in exchange for 4 hours of farming afterwards.
---
Nice stuff! What's the addon to show where item drops and rate percentage? Like the one you have in a tooltip
---
So most loot councils

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raul_Tejada 
---
&gt;Raul Alfonso Tejada is a Mexican ghoul mechanic and gunslinger living in the prison building at the top of Black Mountain in 2281.   
---
Born in 2047, Raul has had a long and storied history. Before the Great War, Raul grew up on Hidalgo Ranch just outside of Mexico City. He was a marksman and mechanic, both of which occasionally got him in trouble with the law. During the war, the ranch he lived on was spared from atomic destruction due to being located in a remote area. Raul also witnessed Mr. House's missile defense system protecting most of Las Vegas from an impressive amount of distance. Soon, the ranch was beset by refugees seeking food and shelter. The Tejada family was as accommodating as they could be, but the amount of refugees was too much for them to handle. Raul's father was forced to turn down any more unfortunates seeking help, due to their resources becoming scarce.
---
This predates the talent revamp when they actually added a way to finish of runners (Hammer of Wrath)
---
no, because it's just griefing at this point. they had to reset the servers to fix it the first time.
---
you are good. You probably will want to change to use succubus soon for the mana it gives you. voidwalker should be your least used pet
---
&gt;I am aware of this but most of the playerbase has no idea. It's one of those things that should be made stupid proof because most players have no idea what party commands are or their purpose.
---
And this is why blizzard took it away from groups in retail. But the classic community wanted the old way back.
---
Yes and that's what he is asking about; if a mob goes into evade mode, they just go back to where they were pulled from
---
Winter spring Frost Saber, really hard to reach mount. Only difficult because its one of the massive timesinks of Classic mostly.
---
Rattlegang!
---
The person who is selling or asking is not the silly one. The ones who buy or join are.
---
Don't join if you don't like the rules. There's nothing weird about this and it takes hours and hours of his time to organize the raid.
---
Well. They can try.
---
Short answer, yes.
---
So many healers on Skeram. I think we are disproportionally represented this time around.
---
Nice! Congrats on that.  The important question though...
---
Horde or Alliance :D
---
Absolutely. Where is my Ivory raptor?
---
"Server is dead" is the most overused and inaccurate term ever. It's mainly just the zoomers/Twitch memers who can't stop claiming a server is dead if it doesn't have a bigger, laggier population than their streamer realm.
---
Alts are a choice, world pvp is a choice, grinding for gold, bgs eventually. There are plenty of things to choose from.
---
That's pretty low level to be freaking out about gear.
---
I completely agree with you in terms of standard gear and boss loot. The run is mostly guildies and we are just looking for extra help so it is not like we are owe it to the pugs. However when it comes to the bindings for example, it makes no sense to allow these to be rolled for, especially with pugs/none guildies in the group as the chance for a pug to come across two is incredibly low. Also they are a huge benefit for the guild and the least it deserves for creating, leading and organising the MC run in the first place.
---
This sounds like a bunch of half-stories to me.  The first one I can believe - the one where you invaded an RP event with an irrelevant proclamation of your sexual orientation.  If I'd gone to the trouble to arrange a guild meeting in game, and someone showed up and was being a jerk just for fun, it probably wouldn't cross my mind to report you but I'm not surprised if you were (nor should you be).  
---
The other stuff sounds like you're leaving out important details.  pics or it didn't happen.
---
I raid led for a prog guild for a little while. no one in the guild had any real prog experience, me literally learning how to tank as we progressed (I guess i did a good job since no one figured that out.) The guild leader wanted to do a loot council, thinking it would help progression to give drops the most bang for the guild progressing. 
---
There was not a single week where I didn't have some rumble in guild that I was playing favorites. It didn't matter. I had excel breakdowns with every drop linked to every member and their increase from getting it, and barring exceptions that would be listed on the excel, every drop was pretty much locked on where it was going before the raid. Did not matter.
---
It is pretty rare to get a group together of completely like minded people, and drama is guaranteed.
---
Where is this corner ? I farm mara but no idea about where someone can stand.
---
Normally PuGs reserve bindings and tranq shot from what I've seen, so yours is definitely the norm.
---
Don't let Redditors catch you saying that, they're very protective over certain toxic guilds \*cough\* APES.
---
It uses the new resists or w.e. I don't have/know where to find the info for when they changed pvp system but you're not at a huge advantage anymore just by being a higher level opponent. Someone -15 levels can easily chain cc you.
---
And they don't attack horde aggresors unless I strike back. It's like - I am standing at the horses guys, dude is killing me and nothing, I strike back, and the guards jump on me and THEN on the aggressor.

This is the result of someone either being too dumb to know that they can't even use it, or someone being an asshole. It has nothing to do with retail

edit: so to go back to my original statment the op was saying that people were downvoting because they were bad, i was saying we disagree as we downvoted because the post showed a MOB not princess leashing around the rock, we asked for proof and later on in the thread the op gave us a link to a video,

What was said after ? How did the party chat go lol.
---
Cool
---
Someone scammed lionhearts mats from someone else on my server and the scammer gets to keep playing while the guy who got scammed lost all the mats.
---
I moved from Firemaw right when Earthshaker opened. I was alone for quite some time but time passed and now the server is fantastic. Medium is a the way to go

Dang nice.

Who wants a body massage??
---
You sure it is the horseriders? The normal guards dont touch anyone
---
They can out dps the mages quite easily.
---
Rogues it will depend on fight and warriors were always king.
---
Being the 2nd/3rd class in terms of damage isn’t exactly “bad at pve” lmfao
---
It’s funny how you bring up private servers when you don’t know that locks are considered top tier dps on private servers.
---
Loot councils that give items strictly to officers or their friends are bad loot councils, which disqualifies it from what I'm talking about.
---
People DO pass up obvious upgrades with DKP, and it DOES matter because it slows down progress overall. It was extremely common (especially in TBC, particularly rogues trying to get glaives) to abuse DKP systems and actively try to fuck over other guild mates in order to horde DKP for weapons.
---
I remember my guild in WOTLK was forced to switch from DKP to loot council because one of our guild members (an officer and one of our oldest members, btw) was passing on his BIS belt (girdle of Razsuvius) to horde his DKP for Betrayer of Humanity while wearing a green questing belt.
---
no system is perfect, but a fair and balanced loot council is the healthiest for the overall success of the guild. I'm sorry that you haven't ever experienced a good loot council before, because it makes for a great raiding experience.
---
I was trying to powershift on the Baron fight and realized I was out of mana.  I too thought that mama could not be burned while in other forms.  I hope they fix this soon.  I was quite embarrassed with my DPS on that fight!
---
There was a huge thread about this on the forums before release. Blizz doesn’t care or want to have those mounts because they were from a previous version. Bad excuse is bad and it’s true they should have had these og mounts for phase 1 and switched to the armored ones for phase 2. Then there would actually be a distinction from those who got their mounts before phase 2.
---
Blood plague was a bug, all bugs fixed by 1.12 stays fixed, no changes.

"you just got black listed by my entire guild, loser. expletive! /ignore"
---
then no one else in the guild even knows the real loser exists
---
That's a bit excessive, the build provides you with more crit than mm and more defensives against melees. It's a very good build, just not as good for the group since you don't have trueshot aura.
---
I started being able to sell enchants when I got the 1h normal striking and 2H impact enchants, because they glow and are a slight benefit for lower lvl players.
---
I think boots minor speed is at lvl 225 and that is an enchant you can actually sell for profit- though honestly there are probably so may enchanters offering services you are better off spending time leveling or grinding gold to make money. I only really sell enchants when I see people in trade chat looking for an enchanter and respond quickly
---
Honestly only had troubles getting there once or twice. And only because horde were camping outside SS. Once I got past the blockade. The run in was quite easy.
---
Dead things can't evade.
---
In Hamish's thread he said they were liquidating guild bank and using it on consumables to spread to the innocent guild members. Hopefully that's true.
---
Hi, regarding Shaman’s Stormstrike and Windfury: 
---
Can Windfury proc off of Stormstrike? (I’m guessing yes)
---
And also, does WF have an internal cooldown? Cause I feel like if WF procs and I immediately Stormstrike, SS never procs WF.
---
Therefore, is it correct to wait like 3 seconds before Stormstriking if you happen to get a WF proc?
---
Thank you! These questions are killing me!
---
You’re just bad dude. 
---
Face facts.
---
Lmao for people like that, I keep rank 1 water on my action bar, trade them a stack and say peace.
---
Any level is a low level to freak out about gear. Gear doesn't make the player and a good attitude will generally get you where you wanna go.
---
It's intentionally designed that way.  Each quest is in small digestible parts.
---
That's what duels are for. Unfortunately "unfair" matches are usually the norm because there aren't any rules forbidding them. Path of least resistance really.
---
My way of dealing with this is to slightly outlevel STV quests, grouping with people, and grinding some dungeons instead. It generally reduces the risks of being ganked/camped barring some very bored lvl60s.
---
File a GM report, if they deny, re-file it.
---
Yes, I know. I was asking for the purpose of comparing gear. If an item has 30ish Int compared to an item with say 7 spell power. I wanted to have an idea which I would benefit from the most.
---
I've done some more research and now I have an idea.
---
That one yes. Cheers
---
The real question is, can you equip both and if so do they have separate cooldowns?
---
Go to a pvp server
---
Only toxic guild so far is &lt;Banan TV&gt; so far 4 ninja looters. Seems like they support that behaviour.
---
Oh ANOTHER double dalrends post!
---
I think you mean to say “if they’re allotted a slot for corruption out of the 16 rebuff slots”.
---
Even then, a warrior who knows what they are doing will be hard to beat.
---
Mages and rogues are quite beatable on the other hand.
---
"top end guilds" tend to like to play classes that are known to be strong. You will see many guilds from private servers who like speed running stacking the best DPS classes. That's what people are talking about. We all know at this point that the content is easy.
---
Please check on a calculator.

I agree!  It's just stuff. And at level 15 or whatever, it'll get replaced super quickly.
---
It was pretty plain as day that thrall was infatuated with her considering she reminded him of the Human that freed him.
---
She was very much at a narrative point as the end of WC3 to be the peace between ally and horde as she was negotiating with Dalaran. 
---
It was the most shoehorned plot to have thrall step down. A single undead blowing up theramore and Jaina became anti-horde "burn them all".
---
WeirdChamp
---
Yes, like I said. Using X for Y doesnt mean Y exists natively. Theres no shared ownership/permissions. Theres no guild features.
---
My first character back in the day had over 20 days /played when i hit lvl 60. My second one had 12, mostly grinding while rested. This time it took me about 10, doing a mix of dungeons and questing with some pvp mixed in.
---
Practice makes it go a lot faster. Dont stress out about being maxlevel.
---
Relamar is correct. Taking imp. frost bolt just increases your dps.
---
That’s just Forsakens things...
---
He tryna' clap them cheeks.
---
Aussies are nuts. I used to run late night ZG runs on Illidan back in the day and there was always 5 -10. They talked so much shit, but never meant any of it. I loved it.
---
yeah but you can reroll random afterwards and transfer to someone else. BoP your just fucked.
---
You bought 100g+ worth of consumes for an MC pug? Dude, that is retarded. Why does this sub seem so full of extremely opinionated bad players...
---
Haven’t laughed that hard at a video posted here in a while. Thank you.
---
The regular cables only work when they aren't used on a class capable of rezzing people. They have literally never worked on me
---
Never allow a PuG in a group with 4 guildmates.   I flat out avoid PuGs completely because of shit like this.
---
Firemaw EU if I'm not wrong. Three ony raids fighting about pugs to fill last spots.
---
Windfury can proc off stormstrike. Windfury does have a three-second internal cooldown. Not sure about the math on whether or not it's best to wait after a windfury proc to do SS, I'm not enh.
---
You're supposed to use a decay (like 10%) after every raid. That incentivizes people to take loot even if its not a big upgrade. Forcing loot doesnt make any sense.
---
Isn't that the quest where you need to equip the trinket that lets you see ghosts? Might be wrong but maybe you can double check that
---
like many here I leveled to 60 as a drain tank and respecced to sm/ruin. It works great and I loved it. 
---
I'm currently leveling another lock (lvl 43 atm) as full destro and it's amazing. It's way more fun then drain tanking and the 850 conflag crits followed by 600 shadowburn crits I got at lvl 40 in RFD sold me completely.... and I don't even have soulfire yet!
---
I am squishy, much more so then I was as a drain tank, but that's part of the fun. And most things die before it's a problem. And now that I have deathcoil and I'm starting to stack a little more stam my survivability is going up. 
---
Anyway, as I said, draintank works great but I find destro to be really effective also and way more fun so play whatever you like to level, your spec won't really matter until raiding anyway.
---
I remember in open beta, you could just go in there. Not sure why they closed it off a few weeks later.
---
glad i didnt even have to reply myself about how ignorant you are.
---
I love how old thottbot/allakhazam comments have the signature at the end with character, guild and server names
---
Sigh, god help me, I do:

---
Very nicely made, great job man!
---
Are they hostile to other trolls?
---
i think the skeletal warhouse is the coolest in game plus everyone thinks raptor is cooler so everyone who does this has the raptor. get the UD mount imo
---
&lt;GRIND&gt; also seems to be filled with assholes, bunch of them camping devilsaurs and if they dont get the kill they stand inside the devilsaur and wait for you to loot it so they can ninjaskin it. We tried multiple time to reason with them and even contacted officers and guild leader but none of them cared.
---
Its because they are the only melle healers .
---
Who cares
---
It’s why I run around as a paladin with a healer kit and a plate DPS kit. Although since I respeced to holy at 52. Might as well not carry around that DPS kit with how much my damage potential went down. Ret talents don’t look like much. But once you add them up. Damage potential goes way up.
---
Yeah, but why disband the guild entirely at that point instead of doing the kicks after making the hammer?
---
Like counting all their in game store money.
---
On private servers there were runs called "boes reserved", the concept was they would run Live Strat with uber geared tank/heal sometimes extra DPS, and the final members get carried for the BOP gear that drop. It saved a lot of pain for some dps to get the drops they are after, and they can sit back and get carried.
---
With that said, until it's an 8/8 might tank and healer, not worth it at all.
---
Yeah, I already posted that ten hours before you.
---
Don't forget The Caverns of Time!
---
You're gonna love ubrs and much of BRD i think.
---
I would be with you but like he said, all that is reserved are the bindings and crafting mats. If they were reserving tier pieces etc it would be more of an issue but they aren’t.
---
Either way, his guild, his raid, his loot rules. No one is forcing people to join, if they don’t like the rules just move on.
---
Nope, hes an idiot.
---
Hard as fuck
---
Oof
---
Oh true
---
source for save the children then please? I'm sure you have them :)
---
Bad leadership.
---
This guy should not be gm of anything tbh.
---
I've helped some guildies farm and we've seen savage gladiator chain as much as HoJ. Not as bad as getting omnicast boots from golem 40-50+ times in a row (literally nothing else has dropped) when also going for nagerling for the tank.
---
Youre just flat out wrong. Youre not factoring in weapon normalization at all so im gonna go ahead and assume you have no fucking idea what youre talking about and are just parroting shit from someone else that has no fucking clue either
---
Image below shows how much weapon speed affects damage. Note that the top end on both weapons are exactly the same but when you pull up your character screen the slower weapon's top end is alot higher?????????????
---

Its incredibly rare that someone needs "accidentally", and its incredibly naive to think people wouldn't exploit the shit out of it, given all the other exploiting people do every single chance they get.
---
You need lots of time to be a geared 60 already.
---
This is not BC. The only advantage Holy Paladins have is the mana efficiency of Flash of Light. Otherwise, they have the lowest single target hps.
---
The reason you take Holy Paladins is that Retribution Paladins are even more inept at dps than Holy Paladins are at healing - not because your Holy Paladins are a meaningful part of addressing high pressure healing demands.
---
Yes, I get about a whisper an hour to tank as a druid. Every dps warrior wants you to tank.
---
Keep up on the taunt grimoire for sure
---
Just type /join LookingForGroup
---
Personally I don’t see the point in buying AH Blues while leveling unless you are a warrior for a good 2H or you need for a twink toon. I always AH blues even when  I could use them. Gold towards mounts and gear at 60 is way more important to me.
---
"Let's do the dungeon."
---
"Nah, I need this worthless loot."
---
"Okay then, I'm gonna find people who want to do the dungeon."
---
"Fuck you."

Why do you expect warriors to tank your strat live runs for free?
---
Just FP
---
I personnally chose soutshore to be closer to SM if i want to find a group
---
Just a psa for hunters, I bound pet attack to scroll wheel up and pet follow to scroll wheel down, it’s super intuitive and feels great.
---
More likely a AoE Farm Frost Mage could use it.
---
These fully rigged models and keyframed animations... They make this really uncomfortable for some reason. Especially the faces... There is something just... Spoopy about em.
---
Exactly
---
You should stay arms while you're farming your fury gear, arms is better for dungeons and in general better till you have decent +hit gear.
---
Guild banks weren't introduced in Vanilla...
---
Lvl 41 enhance here: Its been situational for me.  WF 2H if in group or PvP
---
1h+shield flametongue on lower mobs + seating totem dispatches them really quickly without taking hardly any damage.
---
Tempted to roll Ele but my enhance gear is pretty good right now.

They already confirmed it won’t be in this go round :(

I would try azeroth auto pilot. Not aure if there is anything better

Yes please do I really like your UI and I’m super anal about UI’s I hate clutter.

yeah I have mine set to arrow key up and arrow key down and find that pretty good too!

Maybe not in MC but.....

This is Earthshaker not Firemaw bud.

a lot of similar threads aye, sometimes people get so worked up but it's just like, hello friend this literally won't matter in 5 levels when you replace it with some quest blue

So, no reason to bring you to raids.
---
Think it might be called AtlasLoot.

You misspelled "full of assholes who think if someone is an asshole but gets away with it it's fine, but if you're a guy just trying to make a fair and successful raid for everyone you're retarded"

That poor warrior...

Just got my mount yesterday, so happy that i don't need to run anymore.

26agi is slightly better but it's relatively close.

you can easily solo vicious starting 28+, 1 bandage + heal potion and you are set.
---
Opening week had me like ^^^

Nice fantasy. However many holes are in it.

You would think that a functioning raiding guild was more valuable than the Hand of Ragnoros itself but who knew. I say reform under new leadership and raid without him.

There's no guild bank in classic...

His hearthstone stuff just isn't up to par with the old wow content.

Why stop at BoE? BoPs can be sold, can't they?
---
Coulda been a Druid
---
"hours and hours". Literally just made a full pug yesterday for MC. Took me about 1 min to make a macro about the time of the raid beforehand, and 1.5h to create the full 40 man group.
---
And the rules as I've said many times were misleading.
---
I don't understand how any of you think it's ok to pour 1k gold to a single person for 2 hours of his time. But ok. Guess that's just how it was in vanilla so it's ok that this shit continues happening in classic.
---
#Rattlegang
---
Every good guild will have a bank where all the mats and stuff that drops in raids will go. It can be a character, or just some space in GMs bank.
---
Not sure how to read your post, but if you're being sincere I can only point to the strong irony of it all.
---
Nice, you in giantstalkers?
---
Now I feel like shit for killing them four times last night.  :/
---
Really want BFD quest wand for my lock, but can’t seem to find a horde group running it (though a ton of clothies LFG). Thinking maybe get 4 clothies to pitch in for run to Kelris. How long would that take and what is a fair price?
---
Pretty sure if you set loot rules in chat before the run starts and have people agree to them you can have Blizzard take action. If you don't set any loot rules or only set them on voice (where there is no record for Blizzard) you're shit out of luck.
---
It might seem slightly annoying, but if there are very valuable drops that you don't want people to roll on, lock them and have people agree to the rules. MS &gt; OS would have been enough for this to be prevented.
---
Druids are like that because we play every role. 
---
When i tank, I’m super considerate of the healers mana because I’ve been that healer who’s at 10% mana when the group charges into that next pack.
---
When I heal or dps, make sure the tank has time to build aggro, because I’ve been that tank who’s trying to LOS and everyone else goes balls to the wall.
---
When I dps, I pop out of form to heal myself if I’m low, because I know that the healer is focused on keeping the tank up. 
---
It’s a lot easier to help enable other roles when you know their struggles firsthand.
---
Exactly.  Worked amazing for us.  People would argue over NOT taking gear (“no way its a bigger upgrade for you”) and it was always figured out by class leaders before raid day based on the loot table of current progression.  So as soon as a piece dropped it would be “ok its the agi mail, thats going to hunter X”.   Each group would spreadsheet everything before hand so they knew what would constitute the greatest total raid benefit.  Also we werent assholes.
---
Around 1am (I'm EU), servers are either medium or low. Around 4am the mediums are low, and the low say layered.

DKP isn't exploit proof. Saw a few horror stories form people whose guilds stopped updating the DKP publically, and somehow the officers always had just enough DKP to bid on the items they wanted, or people who were bidding against them somehow never had quite enough.
---
What is the Priest for?
---
I played rs3 and Osrs. Basically it's the same thing. Rs3 = retail wow Osrs = classic wow. Easiest way to sum it up
---
Paying someone to play their role. Now that's sad and pathetic. Had a tank whisper me a couple weeks ago, "In case you were wondering, it's 20g a run or 5g per person. You can also pay me in greys and greens."
---
To which my response, "Thanks douchebag, I actually wasn't wondering. If only I could shove the 5g up your ass, would I ever agree to that."
---
Add these people to your ignore list. They provide a toxic mentality and should never be trusted.

They say you shouldn't eat cherry pits either but ...
---
Is there a way I can see how many auto attacks are required to increase 1 weapon skill. Like how many attacks are needed to go from 290 to 291? What about 299 to 300? etc
---
I'm not going to repeat what I've said already. What I can tell you is that me and every mage in my guild is consistently getting 50g+ per hour.
---
I've also never had to use the reset spot. I've had a lot of resists, sometimes two in a row but there are ways of dealing with it. If you do get 2 in a row it's going to be a close one with pot + gem and possibly Evocate. You could CoC kite, or you could use rank 1 Blizzard to kite for instance.
---
It just takes some practice to get it right and to make it consistent, but I'm sure you can get there.
---
Arsenic is a base element, not a compound, so washing it is just as good.

Why do you expect to get free water from a mage in your instance group?
---
Why do you expect to not pay a price to the hosting guild for all items you win in a semi pug?
---
Why do you expect to recive help in world pvp from someone on your faction without paying first?
---
Why do you expect to recive heals in instace grp without paying the healer?
---
Why do you expect that damage dealers should do damage on mobs without payment based on overall dps?
---
The zeppelins are for shipping, you're pretty much just hopping on for a ride that way going anyway. It's part of a deal with your faction entirely as well.

I have work off every 2nd day and in my experience everyone tries to be smart and farm during work hours. The best time I've found is early in the morning because that's when the late night gamers have gone to bed and everyone else is sleeping or getting ready for work/school

As a warrior who has yet to see this drop in about 40 runs, this triggers me

I see you Raul.

It really depends, look on Wowhead for anything purple boe related, will show drops from specific level mobs.

Personally I love the room you spawn in when taking mara princess portal
---
Ok, ty for your answer mate
---
I tired that. The Show Your Work quest for goblin engineering is still available. Do I have to just finish the chain in order to go back to gnomish after dropping and relearning?
---
very good, also the air you breath has trace amounts of my farts, so you shouldn't breath it
---
Exactly this. Play the game to it's fullest and don't hate on others for wanting a different experience than you do
---
Maybe to you it makes 100% perfect sense but then imagine that for another half of the raid it makes 100% perfect sense to not define a BiS item for the whole phase as a Sellable. And then maybe he'll just ML some BoP to himself? I mean, it can be sold so technically he didn't lie right?
---
I like to dot up 2 mobs while letting VW offtank the second one, then I focus and drain-tank one down and by the time the first is dead, I have a comfortable 2nd kill lined up. 
---
If there are more than 2 mobs, the aoe taunt on VW means it can handle aggro while I figure out how to fear and focus damage without wiping. Seduce only works for 1 mob and precludes the use of dots, so I don't really like it for solo PvE.
---

They know about the human kingdom of Stormwind. They're the remaining humans that refuse to give up their old home. They'd rather die than abandon it.

How will I know the tank has threat
---
Do it, it's the only correct answer in here.
---
Hahaha, spot on!
---
Why? People do dungeons to get gear and/or quests/rep. If that gear is reserved then you're locked out. A tank that want unneeded loot doesn't affect that. DPS classes doesn't run dungeons for gold but instead have more faster and efficient ways than wait for hours to find a tank. When they're geared up they're off to their farming spots while tanks and healers do nothing. But with this they can keep dungeons more active and make a profit of it while people get the gear they want.
---
I don't know that I would want to do loot council as the leader. The drama that could arise from each piece...ugh. Even a perfect system leaves people feeling shafted because everyone fully believes themselves worthy of purple loot.
---
Are you Pronkers, /u/namdo? If so, I think you have a hell of a lot more to answer for,
---
It doesn't have to be, it just often is.
---
Even if the DKP is all being logged and entered without any shenanigans or corruption, people still tend to pass good and valid upgrades for them in order to get one they particularly want. Or some classes with minimal (or no) use for a very powerful item take it from ones that get gamechanging advantages. Or people collude to keep bids low on something to screw people. Or tanks with no competition for their tier suddenly decide they need to burn their DKP on bis dps gear for various aoe/threat/etc sets. It can absolutely be a working system, but if you're in a group of people decent and honest enough to use DKP well then LC would probably work too.

Exactly this.  I have seen it a few times.  Had another group trying to reserve the healing trinket while looking for a healer.  Even having the trinket I told them no way.
---
I want to be triangled by a female Tauren
---
Well its a grey area for me. As the host guild and the ones who are putting together the raid, yes you are allowed to reserve mats/bindings. But how much of the raid is PUG/non guildies and how many are guildies? If you're putting together a pug w/ 20 guildies and filling the other half with nonguildies, yea thats a bit scummy. If you guys have the majority of raid slots and are filling a few empties, then I think its def understandable that you reserve. 
---
But again, I do think its dependent on the situation. In short,
---
If you have a lot of guildies in the raid and only fill a few spots with non guildies,  reserve is reasonable. 
---
If you are filling majority of the raid with non guildies, reserve is not reasonable.  IMO.
---
I play both factions on Bigglesworth. By /played time, my Alliance account is my “main”, though my Horde account has had better luck in Molten Core for gear.
---
What class and level are you?
---
You're still playing on a server that had queues? Rip
---
Guilds that pug and reserve items always put a bad taste in my mouth. 
---
It's respectable to be up front about crafting mats and bindings being on reserve, as joining your group is completely voluntary, but it's equal work for less reward.
---
dozens!  you can have bags full of them.  But they are just  that, simple pets that hop / fly /  slither behind you and don't interact with anything

This is flipping art! Incredible work! Keep it up.
---
I love Plater for coloring nameplates by aggro. Super usefull for tanks, you immediately know if you lose aggro on some mobs.
---
Edit: it requires a bit of tweaking to your liking tho
---
The dude even says it's a fee, not a tip suggestion, this mongoloid was clearly just desperate to rant about something.
---
Nobody joins a run for MC to make gold ? The crafting mats are to go towards crafting legendaries and guild gear.
---
Also keep in mind that the percentage increase is much lower, because we use the same ammo from fresh L60 to Naxx, Thorium Headed Arrow. It has 17.5 DPS, which effectively just increases weapon DPS.
---
So, while 31 &gt; 42 DPS sounds like a 33% increase, it's actually 48.5 &gt; 59.5, which is only about an 18.5% increase.
---
Our final weapon, Nerubian Slavemaker, is 57 DPS, or 74.5 DPS with ammo. We get it from the final boss of the final raid of all of Vanilla, and it's only our third epic weapon for BiS progression.
---
So, a fresh 60 hunter might have a 48.5 DPS _blue_ weapon, and a stacked end-game hunter will have a 74.5 DPS weapon, which is around a 35% weapon DPS increase over the entire course of L60 content.
---
Good thing we stomp PvP.
---
Feel free to host your own pugs and shut up.
---
How about you try it out? Only thing I could imagine would be some lag depending on the bandwith of your internet connection.
---
As melee, there's some good ass gear in there for you, so you should do it while you can get xp from it
---
I got a chromatic carapace on my fucking mage
---
And every race in real life!
---
Those numbers aren't accurate for US realms.
---
Exactly this, my guild is super casual, pvp oriented, but there is a handful of us raid ready that want to raid. I recently plugged MC and set up a deal with their GM, so our 10 raiders will now be a part of their raid team until our raid numbers get up. They’ve reserved bindings and mats, everything else round robin. It’s a win win for both of us
---
You can download a threat meter or just wait a few seconds
---
Corrupt leaders can abuse DKP to hell too. On Spinebreaker, a guild formed out of multiple small guilds, and the deal was that all would have equal say in leadership, but a few from one guild took over DKP, and quickly their favorites had 200-300+ more DKP than others. Leaders would invent reasons to give bonus dkp, including bonus dkp for showing up to  "raids" deliberately scheduled so that only the inner circle could "attend," or demonstrate how nice they were by giving bonus dkp for farm content when the right people were around. Pair that with top dkp wins no bid, low dkp price per item, and no weekly point decay, and the "top" raiders had 500+ DKP before the guild could consistently down Onyxia. All it took was a few months to set up the inner circle for the rest of retail.
---
How about you shut the fuck up?
---
lol... yikes. You're free to make a "fair" raid. In most peoples opinions, its "fair" to let the guy who gives up his free time and effort putting the raid together keep the items they want. That's beside the point that spending 100g+ on consumables for MC is straight up retarded man. It's a loot pinata.
---
That's why a % based DKP system with certain rules on items takes care of 99% of these issues.  
---
If you use a standard DKP bid system where anyone can bid on anything and collude, then you are using a stupid broken system.  
---
If you use a percentage based DKP system with some rules in place then it's extremely rare to ever have loot drama and everyone gets geared.
---
Horde area with all the trolls and the stupid crab quests that take way too long
---
But why? What was your thought process rolling need...
---
finally a reference I can get. It happens so rarely on reddit, people with their fucking random references from different worlds.
---
Easy to sell a character with a Hand of Ragnaros to a third party for real money.
---
Try selling that raiding guild for real money.
---
That's what this was all about, guaranteed.
---
There is sound tho
---
It is part of the charm of classic to not be 100% efficient in every capacity. I found it amusing pvping as a tank.  Or even farming as a tank. Its  not like farm requires a streamlined farming spec. It just take a little longer.
---
Pagle!
---
it was on high at nights (or5min queu's)but in weekends i can get 1 hour queue's
---
I have a female orc and I'm debating on getting uc rep as well. Both colors would look cool. Extra 700g for rep....
---
I tried logging in earlier tonight and was met with a 6 hour login queue. This is very relatable ❤️
---
Wow this works perfectly. I thought I was going to have to ditch TellMeWhen as there did not appear to be a solution for Overpower but looks like you found it.
---
I'm entertained regardless *munches popcorn
---
Literally everyone should evacuate immediately
---
Could be worse could have a warlock looking for a priest for LBRS but the leggings and gloves are reserved lol
---
As someone who’s always played on a PVE server in retail, choosing to play on a PVP sever in classic was the best decision besides playing classic itself. 
---
Where you are now, you’re just ignoring or passively competing with the other faction for mobs and resources. On a PVP server, the competition is direct. It adds so many more opportunities to actually interact and play the game! 
---
I will say, while I rarely aggress and go after members of the other faction, if I’m ganked, I will go for blood. There are so many members of the opposite faction added to my kill-on-sight list, I look forward to my sweet revenge.
---
Yeah man it's funny. I was such a classic skeptic. Felt like the entire internet was so hyped of it, except for me. I sincerely thought it was all nostalgia and as soon as people encountered all the old-fashioned stuff and restrictions there would be this mass disappointment. But I already had an active sub for retail which I'd re-activated not long ago to check out 8.2 content, so I figured, why not give it a shot with my old pals who think it'll be great.
---
Yeah, pretty much been obsessed from day 1. It's fantastic.
---
What are good boosting classes?
---
That’s commitment to a role. 
---
/applaud
---
No trolls tolls, no dwarf rolls
---
Which is great...until XYZ with all the loot stand in the bad the only surviving players are trying to heal BWL with blue pre-bis.
---
&gt;Loot councils that give items strictly to officers or their friends are bad loot councils, which disqualifies it from what I'm talking about.
---
No it doesn't disqualify it from conversation at all, it's the main problem with loot councils.
---
&gt;People DO pass up obvious upgrades with DKP, and it DOES matter because  it slows down progress overall. It was extremely common (especially in  TBC, particularly rogues trying to get glaives) to abuse DKP systems and  actively try to fuck over other guild mates in order to horde DKP for  weapons.
---
&gt;I remember my guild in WOTLK was forced to switch from DKP to loot  council because one of our guild members (an officer and one of our  oldest members, btw) was passing on his BIS belt (girdle of Razsuvius)  to horde his DKP for Betrayer of Humanity while wearing a green questing  belt.
---
So as I said, have forced bids on PVE upgrades and minimum bid amounts. This prevents exactly the situation you are talking about, while also preventing officers or GMs having an unfair amount of leverage regarding loot distribution.
---
&gt;no system is perfect, but a fair and balanced loot council is the  healthiest for the overall success of the guild. I'm sorry that you  haven't ever experienced a good loot council before
---
I have been in many and many with dkp during classic and tbc. DKP always worked out better as it was fair and you had less disgruntlement among raiders. Loot distribution via officers and GMs has tonnes of area for error, DKP may do as well but at least it guarantees fairness. I am sorry you did not get to raid with an intelligent enough GM to actually implement a workable DKP system.
---
Is that ElvUI? If so, could I bother you to message me your settings profile?
---
I think Nostalrius started the whole thing with their 10k population.
---
I'm considering rolling a tank as my first alt and this is only helping the matter, I just love healing
---
With PvP, resistances are calculated different that PvE. It’s much easier to slow/stun a high level player than a high level mob
---
Some servers still got ques?

I’m pretty sure he knew this was Gona be turned into a reddit post, this is exactly why he did it lol for attention.

But of course.
---
Is this on Zandalar Tribe? I recall seeing some Warlocks make doom and gloom messages and Rain Fire in UC. :D
---
Alliance is the current tryhard faction due to having all the best racials for PvE by far. Horde is mainly PvP players or people who don't care too much about PvE minmaxing
---

I don't think I would trust any system other than /roll in a pug. Reasonable exceptions can apply with MS&gt;OS, and I'd expect anyone to be called out if it's a ninja bid.

---
Loot systems in PUGs for raids should always be group loot. There’s a trend at the moment on some servers where people are using master looter and assigning loot to people who have reserved certain items. I believe this to be bad practice for a PUG. Group loot is the fairest possible outcome for all. Yeah you might not get the loot you want, but that’s WoW life - better luck next time. 
---
This is different in full guild raid groups, master looter may be used in order to assign loot which you have agreed on beforehand. But you may then have problems recruiting random players for your part PUG, part guild group raid if the loot they are also looking for has been reserved by people in your guild.
---
Johnny, do ya play baseball

Jumped a whopping 150 places while watching this!
---
I just refer to her lovingly as "Bread."
---
It goes back to it being an underrepresented class. Lot of druids had to deal with bs from their own faction. Stuff like a fury war wielding a 2h axe saying he can tank, but a restoration druid can't heal. It's also the only class that really mingled with a lot of shared lore. I see so many more druids in Classic than were around back then though. On my server in Vanilla I think there were maybe 10 horde side who were active at lvl 60.
---
For pvp it could be enjoyable because you want to shield but for pve it sucks and all you want are raid buff weapons cause you do no dps.
---
Nightfall iirc
---
Yup, how did you know?
---
&gt;The only advantage Holy Paladins have is the mana efficiency of Flash of Light.
---
And mana cashback on crits. Which is huge. And the ability to use non-cloth equipment, like those leather shoulders with more +healing than t3 shouders.
---
A lot of people prefer to watch videos over reading friend, no need to be a mad boy :)
---
If they get killing blows don’t they get an increase to mana regen? Melee cleave doesn’t need to drink etc so priest keeping mana keeps group going

Terrain exploits are part of the game. Go back to retail or something.

---
I once got banned from the official WoW forums for a reaction to something similar.
---
I had recently dropped from a guild due to moving to another server but still maintained correspondence with my old guildmates.
---
One day, my old GM suddenly looted the entire guild bank, including all items and gold, before disbanding the guild.
---
This was made doubly evil because for the proceeding week, he had changed the guild's DKP policy to allow for members to spend gold for points. All gold spent this way went to the guild bank, so not only did he steal everything from the guild, he also managed to inflate the guild's treasury first.
---
At that time, the DM's refused to reinstate the stolen gold and items, nor did they punish the thieving GM.
---
The bastard even gloated about it on the guild's website and forums before closing those sites as well.
---
Even though I wasn't in the guild anymore, I still felt betrayed and infuriated.
---
This was a guy we used to joke with in Vent for fuck's sake.
---
How did this result in me getting banned on the WoW forums?
---
Long ago, I managed a collection agency and while I no longer had access to a lot of tools used for tracking people down, I still had a few tricks up my sleeve. I was able to secure all the contact information for my old GM, including his phone number, his home address, his parents' address and his business details (the motherfucker owned a goddamned limo company, but still felt it necessary to screw over all his old guildmates).
---
This was absolutely psychotic as hell, and though I absolutely had no intention of ever doing anything with this data, it felt good knowing I could. I also wanted the gloating, thieving prick to know that \*I\* knew his personal information, so I created a few threads on the WoW forums that cryptically included his data. There was no way anyone would have been able to piece this information together or even know what any of it meant, but \*he\* would know that \*I\* knew where he lived. I know I was successful because shortly afterward, Blizzard banned my access to the forums for "disclosing personal information".
---
Ten years later, there is no way I would even consider doing something like this, but holy shit, sometimes the injustice in the world drives you a little bit crazy.
---
Sounds like you have shit healers or bad dps.
---
+2,000 mana helps with two things. You can increase the rank of your heals, and you can sustain your casting for a longer period of time.
---
At the beginning of the fight, this won't help. With the abundance of mana-pools, the top healer is basically just the person that can snipe full heals from the rest of the others. At the end of fights, this will obviously help, but MC encounters shouldn't be lasting long enough to make use of the extra mana. Especially if you have 8 healers, 2 tanks, and 30 dps.
---
Why would the low populations be layered? Makes zero sense
---
Thanks for proving my point even further lmao
---
You can shut the fuck up too.
---
Alright let’s see a SS. What are we dealing with here.
---
No ‘should’ about it. You guys are doing great!
---
The only should is that if you don’t like the rules of a raid’s loot, you shouldn’t join it. Also shouldn’t bitch about said raid’s loot that you aren’t joining.
---
LIke i said in my comment. Go look for yourself how nice these places are. I dont think they had Xbox Ones in Auschwitz. Or just continue to believe a lie. Seems like a common trend

So...we finally found you Raul.

We have more access to data now than in the past.

So I'm actually debating what's better use of time,  buying/grinding runecloth.   Or just going to undead starting zone,  banging out all the quests, and just finishing off with runecloth

He's probably refering to the 2 minute cooldown. And I'm sure that one's shared across all ranks, no?

Are you gay though?

As horde, if you fly into thorium point from the south, you fly over it, do a big loop around the gorge, hit Kargath, then do another big loop back through the gorge back to thorium point to land.

If you are heading to black rock mountain, it's faster to just fly to Kargath from the south and ride a mount over.

Oh really? I didn't know it affected rep gains

He linked a bunch.
---
What's the tracker in the bottom left corner?
---
Would you know any other addon that could solve my issue?
---
Whatever you gotta tell yourself.  I get it now, you're probably a druid tank.  Reread what I said.  We have one in our guild. He does well in raid in specific scenarios.  He's actually kind of hard to heal in dungeons though, because that's just not what they're good at.  You're probably not even a healer after what you've said.
---
if you have a group that has good aoe and a decent tank/healer its very good but if your healer is drinking after every small pull the xp/hr is dogshit and not worth doing at all.

If they actually sucked they wouldn't be on the A team or the BWL roster. But I am sure that's what the officers will say - everyone not in their clique sucks more and matters less. It's a standard line. Furthermore, once you get a gear disparity the epic clad people in their clique WILL perform better than the people in blues. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

New to wow, just installed the auctioneer add on. There’s info about disenchant material value. Is that stuff accurate? I’m lvl 20 and for green items auctioneer disenchant material values are like 1-2g, when AH estimate is like &lt;20s. Should I make an alt to disenchant them?
---
I’ve actually never seen a molten core pug that didn’t reserve legendaries.  Most also reserve crafting mats also.

Travel to Steamwheedle port in Tanaris. There is a hut with a gnome named Narain Soothfancy. Located on a table inside the hut is a book that will allow you to change specilization without a quest or fee.

At least if the guildie gets it, the guild benefits from their upgrade. While some random PuG doesn't benefit me at all.

Yeah it’s true I mean we are investing the time running each week and the risk of drops not going to our guild and not enhancing our ability to run deeper. We’ve organized worked, recruited, run guildies through attunements and helped gear people up just to be ready.

You’re right we should be able to make even more rules and if someone doesn’t like it they can not come. Or join our guild which we always invite everyone to do at the end.

Great story! I love to see opposite factions get along even through the language barrier. I always say ganking someone one isnt gonna get you remembered but a really memorable moment ive had while out in the world was when i was leveling in Tanaris. A Horde hunter named Chigg approached me waved at me, targeted me then cancelled. I instantly understood that he was approaching me for a cross faction duel to the death. It was the most honorable ive ever seen any Horde player be. So i mimicked his wave and target we both backed up a few feet then began fighting. I'll admit he won but he sat next to my body waiting for me to rez and when i got back up he used bandages on me, waved then ran away. Honestly ill never forget it or him. To this day i still wonder what he's doing and if ill ever run into him again.

True it is the jack of all trades but master of none. Two druids would provide incredible utility but still provide challenging situations. Good for team work and communication since you will both be familiar with the class. Only thing you have to worry about is competing for gear. If you do different specs it should mitigate that problem
---
Because you're the one gaining the resources.  It's a pretty easy experiment you can perform if you have tiny threat installed.  Drop a mana totem with someone else in group in combat and you not.  You will not get threat.  Do something to initiate combat with that target.  You'll get the base entry threat.  Now you'll see yours start climbing form the resource gain.

2 druids should work well one tank/dps one healer/dps ezpz
---
Mage is the easiest leveling class and arguably has more survivability than a priest
---
I'd assume most people would find it in their best interest to help out guild members regardless of any gain for themselves. I don't need anything from UBRS but I've ran it countless times with guild members to try and hunt for their remaining BIS items. 
---
Random people wanting to reserve items while looking for other random people is just a scummy thing to do. If people are looking to join a pug, I'd assume most aren't going to waste time. Everyone needs things. I guess some people want to be a little bitch and refuse to roll on items. Hence my comment about getting your friends or guild to help target those items with you.
---
 had my first kill where i wasnt the asshole last night. some dwarf warrior was following around this shaman or druid. dwarf was 34 and the shaman was 26. i a 27 rouge (finally) snuck up close behind while them two were fighting and ambushed him. we got him down and he tried to run away but i spammed backstab. the tauren said thanks and that he was a bitch...lol

Awesome! Thanks!! I’ll check it out after work 😁

Just cover your chatbox. You’ll avoid doxxing any real name friends you have on Bnet and can keep your guild chat and PMs private.
---
Did a few servers get that? I know I heard about it after the fact, but it may have been your server
---
Its variable because your int score has an affect  on gaining weapon skill
---
The mana cash back is part of the mana efficiency of Flash of Light. The ability to use non-cloth equipment is shared with two other healers - and all three of those healers could make a good argument that they'd rather have access to Priest-specific gear.
---
Tipping is 100% not mandatory.

Bad English, like thinking a tip and fee are the same thing, will lead only to miscommunication and hatred at other people.

Make friends with people who aren't retarded and do dungeons with them. Problem solved. I have a pocketmage friend and I love the free water and we help each other get our items (running for the other one even if we ourselves don't need anything anymore) and I know for a fact that he knows the items and won't ninja my shit.
---
Making reliable friends is the best thing you can do in classic.
---
Yeah.   I remember mid level hunters kiting rogues back then to.
---
The game is good at introducing things at a gentle pace. Remember that when it came out, mmo's were nowhere near as well known as they are now. I actually think it's a great introduction to the genre.
---
One piece of advice though: a lot of players know the game inside out, and expect the same of people they meet. When you group up with people, giving them a quick heads-up that you're new will make things go much smoother, since they'll be able to give you directions etc. instead of just assuming that you already know.
---
I made this one. You only need one macro instead of one for each poison. Holding shift, ctrl, or alt will change what poison is applied. 
---
/use \[nomod\] Instant Poison IV; \[mod:shift\] Crippling Poison; \[mod:ctrl\] Mind-Numbing Poison; \[mod:alt\] Wound Poison
---
/use \[btn: 1\] 16; \[btn:2\] 17

The utility is probably tough to beat, but I don't know that they compliment each other so well.

Only if the group gets disbanded, I believe.

Oof. That guy never drops anything when we kill him for out shadow priests.
---
Ardent Custodian, and yeah that thing goes for like 10-20g lol
---
Westfall.
---
Incendius is pretty even pvp server but I think it’s more alliance sided
---
*If* they get killing blows - which is extraordinarily unlikely in a group of 3+ melee cleaving everything in sight.
---
So about the warrior charge first, would it apply if the tournament was on alliance side? If I shadowmeld at start I basically can't get charged.
---
Thought you were in my guild for half a second until I got to that last bit.
---
Our guild has repeatedly had moments where we're winning so much I'm just waiting for a PUG to call conspiracy and quit out. Also we leave mats open to PUGS because we don't want people walking away without having an entire night not even rolling on a damn mat.
---
Seems pretty standard to me.
---
Considering raid loot in classic is often designed with pvp in mind as well as pve, strict loot council isn't the right option.
---
Yeah but more often than not guilds will just use loot council to gear up their inner circle (GM and his RL friends aka officers).
---
Exceptions exist, but I dare argue that a *lot* of loot council guilds out there don't use it as it was meant to be used.
---
I’m not saying it’s ethical but I’ve been a tank gearing through BRD with a server population of 30% warriors, trying to farm for an item with a 2% drop chance, and made reservation remarks. But I’ve only done that because it’s easier than telling 6 warriors trying to dps for the same item why I’m not gonna take them. I mean it kinda sucks but I’m not looking to do 100+ runs instead of 50+ runs because someone else just as capable of tanking doesn’t want to.
---
For example I'm an avid dungeon goeer, however I just received Onslaught Girdle. In my hands planning on ranking and helping people to get geared in dungeons, a BRE would be marvelous, so I can just smash Strat: UD in 35min with 70% group damage. However the way DKP is done, one warrior who hasnt logged in for four days and will not for another three is in front of me in DKP and will likely acquire BRE to log on once a week to top meters in raids and log off again for the next seven days.
---
You can see how the sword, although I already got an upgarde, would be better in my hands playing every evening helping gildies than in the hands of a raidlogger being present once a week.
---
Weakauras has a nice gold fps and ms info in cool font that you can move wherever you like :)
---
Axe spec is 5% crit. Sword spec is 5% double strike chance.
---
My Vanilla guild had far less drama with loot council than with DKP or variations on it. It went from periodic drama with officers gaming dkp to zero drama with different officers running loot council. But our loot council was intended to be fair, not intended to fuck people over or gear up our friends the fastest. All systems can be gamed, it's about the people running it.
---
I cannot WAIT for someone to lie about their question so they're allowed to ask it, walk up to the WoW panel, and say "Why are you so for any kind of political talk as long as it isnt related to Hong Kong or China?"
---
The resulting shit storm would be glorious.
---
‘Enchant’ is a verb, ‘enchantment’ is a noun.
---
And yes, I found an enchanter who didn’t scream at people he doesn’t know on the internet over 10g. It is quite a pleasant experience when you talk to people but they don’t immediately complain about money, give it a try!
---
Put the resto shaman in the group of other healers, so they can take advantage of  Manatide totem...
---
I mean it makes sense. They're part of the triad of "best classes to play" together with Warrior and Priest. Just as back in the day Hunter was the go to class for noobs, it's perfectly reasonable that the noobs are now attracted to the "bis" classes.
---
Out of those two, i'd take a mage. Really easy to solo a ton of mobs, easy to find farm/aoe groups for dungeons.
---
Both are great at pvp
---
Of course you can play as a healer with the priest, but if its dps your after, pick the mage.
---
: )
---
Just count to 5 once the tank starts attacking. Make sure you hit the same mob your tank is hitting also!
---
Just an FP. I would make an argument for Menethil Harbor. Boats to Kalimdor and centrally located in eastern kingdoms. As an added bonus I find the flights from menethil to arathi or menethil to southshore are beautiful. You end up flying over what I’ve just been calling the the “arathi gulf” for lack of a formal name. I’m a sucker for that kind of stuff though.
---
Hmmmmm......
---
My reasoning for picking mage was Free food/water and teleports. 
---
It was very nice.
---
Yeah fix the title
---
My preferred response when i see people reserving drops
---
"LF5M any 5man. All loot reserved. Please fill the run and post it to me."
---
Exactly. People are commenting things as if I’m clueless about this fact. I’m asking as to why it’s staying there
---
PSA To Warlocks in dungeons, if you use life tap you should eat food when everyone else is drinking
---
It’s tough to say. From my understanding, it’s a best case scenario. 
---
For example, let’s say you DE an item, you have a chance of getting a shard or dust. The shard may sell for a nice price, but the dust might sell for very little.
---
Most people want the majority side because they’re not proficient in pvp so they want help.  Alliance on my server always are in groups and only fight if they have the advantage, they either try to run or just emote and accept death in 1v1s
---
Mi two
---
Where do you get this info?
---
Do you know what numbers the other European realms have? I want to play on the highest PVP pop server with as little queue time as possible.
---
I believe it's highly relevant to state how many that's from your guild. It's a massive difference between 8 and 35.
---
Is that still the case for pvp spec'd rogues? I can pop combat rogues most of the time, but IIRC with improved stealth it was pretty decent if you had no spammable aoes.
---
&gt;Safe and inclusive.
---
***slaps roof of banhammer***
---
You can ban SO many dissidents with this thing.
---
I am not mad, I just like to point out the absurdity of something
---
&gt; people still tend to pass good and valid upgrades for them in order to get one they particularly want.
---
I get why this is bad if all you care about is progression, but if the content is easy, this seems preferable, no?
---
&gt;Or tanks with no competition for their tier suddenly decide they need to burn their DKP on bis dps gear for various aoe/threat/etc sets.
---
I personally have no problem with people spending dkp on dps gear if they will use it, even if it is for pvp (which doesn't help the raid per se).
---
I see what you mean about the cons of dkp, but I don't see those things as negatives, especially because I feel like the min/max mentality takes away from the fun when it is pushed to the extreme.
---
Its in the first room with hydras. You have them stand against the wall to the right of tunnel entrance. If you look on mini map you can see the princess room, then you just have to kill her near that side of the room.
---
What’s your server and name so I can ignore you too bruh
---
That's no problem. My guild is clearing both raids and we're FAAAAAAR from hardcore.
---
Lol ok
---
No one is going to follow your twitch stream dude.
---
Nobody joins for that specific reason but it's very much an alluring part of joining a group, is getting a chance at something that can be sold for a decent amount of end game gold or used to boost their own reputation needs.
---
Are you famous for fucking people over or for getting fucked over?
---
Yes you can and can launch it from battlenet
---
Its all from the same thread if you looked closer..
---
I don't have a problem with it because this is how vanilla played and felt, spell batching was part of the game, and the game is behaving as I expected it would. It would be super odd if classic combat felt like retail.
---
Don't be surprised if that is removed this year to avoid just that kind of issue.
---
The rogue was fucked after he didn’t get the kill in the opener.
---
Whoa what server is that? On Kurinnaxx SM is constantly camped by a few groups of horde 24/7. I've ran that place probably 30 times or so and only made it into the instance without being attacked maybe 3 times.
---
Imaging showing off ninjaing an item.
---
Reddit shouldnt be for that. Its a forum
---
No, people are actually just that entitled now from modern gaming
---
This is the correct choice.
---
  the gnomes knew their place back then
---
Mage has mobility in a game that makes you go all over the world. 
---
fast leveling. able to kite. 
---
Has a large variety of solo farms that make lots of gold. 
---
If you were a holy priest though, you would always have a raid/instance spot. 
---
I would Roll mage. 
---
If I could do it all over, I would have rolled mage &gt; my shaman
---
You get 100% of your normal mana regen in the first 5 seconds of spirit tap and 200% after you\`re out of 5 sec. rule.
---
Imagine calling someone bad when facts agree with me :\\ Quit cockriding warlocks because you want them to be good so bad.
---
the battlenet client.
---
For some reason I doubt they are awarding gear based on being "a stable and decent human being."
---
Who da fook is that guy?
---
Oh, I give it to You, but I want to be clear, it takes time to make.   If I was just running to the dungeon I might need a minute or two before we pull, or i might be wanding during first pulls while I make a pile of food and water.  Each conjure can make as few as two water.  And takes ~15-20% of my mana, then 30-45 seconds to drink.
---
Absolutely. No reserve = way more likely to have a ninja
---
He can monetize the video.
---
Because it allows you to, essentially, never go OOM?
---
Kill 2 elites. Than kill all healers 1 by 1. Then kill last 2 elites. Super easy fight.
---
Wow check out this dude guys, he’s not giving views! He made a comment just to let you know he’s downvoting and not giving views!
---
And guilds pay top dollar for them to make that gear. No one pugs mc specifically for crafting mats, but winning one is still a nice chunk of change in your pocket. If guilds want full crafting mat rights then they should do full guild runs. Just my two cents.
---
I'm fathervon :) I can see the points in your post however i dont think it's an accurate reflection of what happened. I now have both t2 items a bit of t1 and just got my eye for benediction :)
---
Ohh 50% sorry. My point still stands. Shadow priest go oom super fast wasting  more mana and overkilling (making dungeon longer/harder) just for some mana regen isn’t popular at all and I honestly haven’t ran a dungeon with a shadow priest as dps yet. I wouldn’t mind, I just don’t think anyone wants them.
---
True but have to be careful. In a shitty group that 10g disappears into food/water, repairs and travel.
---
Not really. You spend a ton of time killing trash.
---
Ah, Rasputin’s Peak - Feralas

Probably going to have to wait till honor grind is around before much world pvp on a pve server.
---
Anyone know why this Hunter on my server is farming Manaclaw in Mazthoril in Winterspring every time I see him? He doesn't seem to be related to any quests or have a unique loot table. I wish I could communicate to this hunter that Manaclaw doesn't drop the Mature Blue Sinew lol...
---
World of Magecraft demands that you roll a mage as everyone else has done.

Private servers tuned bosses harder than vanilla. So you can't use private servers for measurements.
---
How do duels work? Is that what you do in the arena? And I get that it's the path of least resistance but path to what? You don't get any in-game reward for it, and you don't even get the satisfaction of overcoming a challenge because there's literally no challenge to it.
---
I'm probably going to do what you're saying about STV quests and just level up and come back to them, but it sucks because I hate abandoning quests and that's not how I like to play the game, and my log is almost full at this point. There aren't really a ton of quests to choose from either because Arathi has been just as bad for me. But one of my friends suggested I try the Desolace and do quests there so I'm going to go with that and see how it is.
---
Found the asmongold fan. So easy to draw y'all out. Lol.
---
Is there a list of server subs?
---
Ok, nice to know that SS can proc WF. Now just if I would now wether to spam SS or wait the 3 seconds hahah
---
I agree with you 100% about raid logging, especially this early in the content cycle.
---
Do Guilds ever award dkp for helping guildies with 5-mans during the  week? This seems like the best solution if the ultimate goal is overall guild progress.
---
I played a rogue in live vanilla, and a warrior here in classic. Getting random whisper invites to dungeon runs is blowing my mind! 16 year old rogue me never got to do dungeons if I didn't start the group myself haha
---
Intelligence plate is far more rare than int mail
---
Fortunately, strength and stamina are just fine for paladin tanking, especially from this point on. By judging and using seal of wisdom, and using concecrate sparingly such as at the first part of a pull or in urgent you will do just fine and only have to drink occasionally. Just be sure to mark targets like a warrior tank.
---
What?  I don’t get it.

This is for single warlock, as in not taking into consideration ISB procs can go to waste solo. Also, ISB can be resisted which I don't think is included in your code. Adding that in with multiple warlock option to sim ISB uptime with locks at different crit/hit amounts would be nuts.
---
So you think that it is unacceptable for a guild created and guild led  MC run to have bindings reserved ?
---
The guild is doing the run regardless of people joining and I think it's the least they deserve for making the run happen in the first place.
---
I would understand if a guild reserved specific epics or boss drops but bindings are a completely different reasoning.
---
It honestly baffles me when people argue that they should be just free roll as there is almost no way that a random is going to ever be able to make anything out of it. The amount of effort, gold and time that has to go into crafting legendaries is near impossible for any one person. Not to mention that the best person to have it would be the main tank who is in the guild.
---
Lmao that is me, shame I only found this today!
---
Meh...Even though it does cause drama, I feel no accomplishment getting personal loot. Having an item drop and then having to distribute it amongst everyone that helped gives the feelong of having looted a unique artifact from a dangerous foe. Having personal loot feels like your mommy is giving out candy to everyone for actually responding to your birthday party invite.
---
There’s wanting PvP and then there’s being outnumbered 20v1 anywhere you go because faction balanced is fucked
---
Plus... Shaman and Paladin are both sick as hell
---
The particular value you're looking at appears to use fixed prices for mats which aren't correct.
---
Uhhhh...please tell me you all bitched him out, also what did he say? Like what was his excuse for doing that?, I need to know
---
Yeah the alchemist is a great drip income. Pay attention to when the big guilds on your server are raiding and those 2-5gold (or more) margins stacks up quite nicely.
---
Wont be instaepic mount money or anything, but is a great supplement to keep you from dedicated farming while you have other priorities.
---
That's awesome haha!
---
As the site states, the census have not worked in nearly a month. 
---
&gt;As you may know, the census addons do not work correctly since september 19th. That also means, the amount of active characters will shrink day by day in the shown data!
---
Edit: unfortunately there is no reliable way to tell server pops. I've been contemplating a move now so I log in to my target server and check the following:
---
* Number of AH listings (about 10k, about half of source server)
---
* /Who class 60 (only one ever 50 is mage)
---
* /Join lookingforgroup and watch it for a half hour or so
---
Doing those steps should give you a decent idea of what to expect.
---
Yes it really changes WPvP but it's hard to complain since people will prefer it to being fishfood. I doubt anybody will lobby to make themselves easier to be ganked. Between melee/spell leeway, new mob movement, and changes to pvp it's definitely a much different game.
---
I hope we get some sort of Classic+ content that defies everything that Activision's track record is. With the changes already in the game I wouldn't be averse to some other parts of the parcel.
---
it always takes hours on giant servers, manual or automatic. there is a ~5 sec CD on running /who commands even typing them in manually.
---
the census addon now scans on any mouse click so all one needs is do stuff ingame for an hour or so and you get a full census. should take about the same time as it did when fully auto.
---
'' The big benefit of the crappy alliance racials is  '' uhm, stoneform. escape artist. Shadowmeld is used to interrupt your enemies to throw bolts or aimshot at you. also its fine as waiting for stealth cd. 
---
Horde have the Stunresist bloodfury on orcs.. but the other racials are more useful for pve.
---
Ever notice how its never a priest complaining of getting ganked? Theres a reason
---
Did you go out of your way to completely avoid any and all spirit on your gear? Do you think you\`re a warlock and just stack greens "of shadow wrath"? I don't see any other way you can so MASSIVELY underestimate the regen from spirit tap.
---
There is a sytem called EPGP that can track points for other activities.

Is that the fetal alcohol syndrome girl?

This makes a valid point, it wasn’t the alliance. I would only add that, on the alliance side, a scarlet ambassador in the stormwind cathedral recruits us randoms to go kill undead in desolace. After that, another scarlet npc gives us a recommendation letter to join them, to be given to a scarlet rep in southshore. He’s the one to tell us “actually they’re all insane, please kill them.”
---
So former scarlets attacked the crusade via neutral parties. Not the alliance.

Why do people talk about their characters like they are different people.

Lot of angry locks here.

I have a feeling that blizz is gonna stay very quite about anything numbers wise regarding their games for a bit due to the China fallout issue

Rolling system is extremaly RNG, you are not guaranteed to get any loot, +1 system encourage people who get loot to skip next raid as there is nothing for them to gain, attendance is not rewarded, exceptional perfromance is not rewarded, failing on mechanics is not punished. Dunno why are you calling it good.
---
Repair bills of raid geared tank is noteworthy too,  it can end up costing 20x the price of a non geared clothie in your group, and that financial disparity doesn't get equalized in loot so it might make sense to pay exceptionally geared tanks.
---
I’m a level 13 noob. I’m playing warrior too. When I get to dead mines am I supposed to run it multiple times to level or are the diminishing returns not worth it compared to questing? I want to run dps a few times to learn dungeons, but then I want to practice tanking.
---
Is this an rp server? It actually looks surprisingly fun haha
---
Do people see my helmet and cloak if I hide their display?
---
Paladin makes the most sense for utility.  That keeps the option of tank/healer/dps viable for both players as well.  Not having to buy amount makes leveling in Nelf-land less of a concern too, as she will need the help of getting to know gameplay and the nuances surrounding etiquette and mechanics.
---
Yep. I remember that. We were so mad.
---
It's a lot better for tanking, though!

my natural regeneration rate is greater than your attacks, you couldn't kill me even if you tried

It is a RP/PvP server yeah Zandalar Tribe - EU. I don’t mind RP but I never usually get involved but I have to admit it was really fun to get stuck in a bit.
---
Let's do some simple math shall we? Would you rather spend 1 hour(+-) looking for a tank and do nothing? Or would you rather play the game, enjoy it and get a chance at your bis? I would wager that you are actually losing money by not going with that tank, there is still pasive gold to be made in dungeons, chance at recipes, boes, etc. . Don't worry, keep beeing declining these tanks and play the LFTank game! Wonder why people progress in game while you don't because you were greedy for a bit of gold.

Do resistances have thresholds or does it improve with every point up to 315?

Get asked for water and food 3 or 4 times upon entering dungeon...stars pulls while i barely have mana after buffing and making managemsand more foodandmore water, and if you just got new water you get 2 or 4 per cast. But then if you give lower mana you get blasted, but im still stuck at dungeon entrance for 2 or 3 min drinking and casting.
---
I know you shouldn't normally buy gear while leveling but at like 40 if I hadn't gotten a new one by then I would have just picked up a green off the AH for like 75s lol...
---
I was in a dungeon recently that was on need before greed and it stops you from even rolling greed on stuff you can't use. Felt like I was missing out of the stuff that everyone greeds on to vendor/ah
---
This is pretty arguable, but it depends on if you mean pve or pvp. Sure warriors get the extra rage, which is great, but rogues get extra poison procs, and extra stun procs from mace spec. Its arguably the best pvp mace in the game for rogues.

---
If all you care about is exp/hr and you are not running in a spell cleave group, just do it once for the quests and go back to open world questing.
---
Otherwise, do the dungeon as many times as you want! Some dungeons are really damn fun, so who cares if you’re not leveling as efficiently as long as you’re having a good time!
---
You don't know that. In fact, you're wrong, cuz addons can interact with a lot of shit in weird ways.
---
Nah dont buy anything. Doesnt make too much of a difference, gotta save for epic mount
---
Ouch. I have done enough ubrs runs with the guild that all of our healers and a majority of our casters all have briarwood already. And I managed to get mine my first run way back at level 59 rolling against 6 people lol.
---
More like people who simultaneously complain about people reserving stuff and refuse to run their own groups.
---
And those tanks will gear up fast, stop doing dungeons because there is no point, realize there's no use for your "million tanks" in raids and go back to their DPS classes.

---
Because every other system requires the people in charge to make decisions, and that's absolutely shitty. All DKPs systems I've seen have also been extraordinarily corrupt and discourages anyone from entering the guild because the people who have been there will just take all the loot, not to mention how rampant favoritism is.
---
What you've already said in your comment showcases exactly why anything besides random rolls is a shit system. "Oh, you failed on a mechanic? You're not allowed loot!" That will cause so much drama so fast in a guild and from what I've seen will quickly lead to a guild full of bad mannered people who you wouldnt care to raid with
---
I've raided in the top 3 guilds of my server for 4 expansions throughout BC/LK/Cata and most recently WoD. Always been MS &gt; OS roll loot. Anything else leads to tons of drama and typically and corrupt leadership.
---
I fish and play hearthstone on the regular
---
My theory is the first wave was made up of a lot of nostalgic veterans and hardcore players. The hardcore rushed ahead, the veterans took their time to smell the roses and were just happy to be back.
---
At this stage, the hardcore are 60, the veterans are high level, and a lot of the current levelers are made up of people brought in by twitch or people who have been brought in my people already playing who are not themselves all that invested in classic.
---
I had this tank last night tell me 'final warning' after the first trash pull that dropped green upgrade for me that I needed on and equipped right away. He said 'what did you have on before?', so I linked old item, then he says 'what spec are you?' told him. So finally he says 'hmm okay final warning. No more needs, you can get those items from quests'. LOL it was a 2g green item that was literally an upgrade. I left that group right away
---
No, I am in the wrong here then without any additional context then.
---
cheers!
---
Thanks for the lesson, holy fuck. Now get off your high horse.

Lmfao where are you pulling this information from? Besides, looting might not be an interface function, but displaying loot in bags sure is.

Yeah this reverse hyperbole is pretty crazy.

Just because I think you’re a tool making a stupid comment, doesn't mean I’m an Asmon fanboy, or is this how it works for you, anyone that makes a negative comment towards you must be a fanboy?
---
I like gdkp, need before greed in 5 mans, and master looter with rolls for MS&gt;OS in raids. I am not a big fan of the tank reserving melee DPS loot, but tanks in UBRS and 5 mans certainly need to be able to roll for DPS gear or the tank shortage is worse (since most raids need 5% of the group as tank, not 20%).
---
GDKP is the most fair system imo. People bid gold to get gear assigned to them, and everyone gets an equal slice of the gold at the end. Those who got less make gold, those who pay in get desirable gear.
---
Stun chance doe

These cables are the best. They saved an UBRS run back in the day.  Everyone wiped except me and another rogue.  He busts out the cables and shocks the priest back to life.  We all went nuts hahaha.

Shaman. You have a solid leveling experience. Can off heal all the way to 60. The class quests can be tedious but make you feel like your really getting in touch with a zeroth. Your abilities are really just fun and cool looking.
---
Your enhancement spec feels weighty and elemental becomes insane near endgame. 
---
And pvp us a blast as well. Elemental blowing things up or WFW just making folks dissapear.
---
When you’re pugging 25-40% of the group you have to expect lots of drops to go to pugs. Recruiting is the issue here, I think.

DKP leads to people passing on miniscule upgrades to take weapons or gear that is a massive improvement or BiS. The vast majority of Molten core gear is a side grade at best for most classes with only about 15% of the loot being true upgrades or BiS so people will save points to spend on that instead of tier gear that is objectively worse then dungeon gear. Which is why loot council is garbage until at least BWL comes out.

2 druids will do fine together in general questing and will be a good base to get extras in for instances.
---
There are some good guides online for which skills you can skip as a warrior. I wouldn’t even bother with heroic strike, it’s an overrated skill. Uses up your next melee attack, uses up your rage and doesn’t cause that much more damage than auto attacking.
---
In reality you get every single mage and warlock skipping everything in the hopes of buying mageblade.
---
It falls apart in certain scenarios.
---
yeah, what’s so wrong with that?
---
Whaaaat?! hat was the loot?
---
For a person who doesn’t care about how things look (skins, appearances, etc) 
---
It would be cool to have a legit answer to your question. I don’t play horde nor am I a veteran so I couldn’t tell you. 
---
Trolls do look silly tho, orcs are buff and scary.

Disagree. I thought it was bad until I joined a guild with it in TBC. I loved it so much I decided my own guild should use it and we’ve done our best to show there’s no favoritism. Officers aren’t voting for each other to get loot right now until others get it first. We feel it’s best to show we’re not greedy and we are in this for the long haul. We want people to feel rewarded for doing well.

Dead server is actually a private server meme as well so I don't know how accurate that is

Hunter is really fun. Very dynamic, actually very hard. You can do a lot to make groups better and help... you can also make a Tony mistake and screw up everything.
---
Clearly your guild isn't doing the run regardless of people joining or you wouldn't need the people
---
I still wear it in retail too
---
Thank you! Super helpful. I usually cheap shot into kidney shot while spamming hemo. Then blind prep and repeat. I nevrr actually used gouge for the combo point. Thats really smart. My problem usually is actually running out of energy because i spam hemo so much.
---
MC and Ony is not a issue though but i want to clear BWL, AQ and Naxx too. 
---
The chance to still have good raiding guilds when those raids come out are far higher on high pop server.

Uh, no it doesn't.
---
The required raid DPS to kill Patchwerk before he enrages is 7,500.
---
Our guild did [9,300 DPS on Ragnaros](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/aBcbgr6QfMjYW9L2#fight=last&amp;type=damage-done).
---
Yes, I understand that’s a shorter fight, but it also has melee going in/out and dying due to tank knockbacks.  I’d be *very* surprised if we are not killing Patchwerk in under 4 minutes when we get there.
---
My guild does loot council to make sure everyone has a fair share. Guild officers/class leaders get loot last.
---
Dunno about other guilds.

You can believe what you want, but at lvl 40 I only had about 20 gold, and by 43 I had my mount and all my skills I had skipped with plenty to spare. I done nothing special and vendored all greens, found no BOE blues. Just quested.
---
Shouldn't be a problem. I play OW when I'm waiting for next game in battlegrounds. My flight paths are times for a smoke and why the f are you playing on a server with a q lol how bad do you need to feel like you belong Jesus
---
FAPs are banned.
---
It all depends on how hardcore your raid group is. You can get away with a lot in more casual guilds.
---
Near the very end they allowed paid realm transfers.  There were a few restrictions like not being able to transfer from PvE to PvP and not being allowed to transfer to full realms, but other than that it was basically a free for all.

Fight Club
---
Fight Club is a newly founded social guild for casual players who are strongly interested in PvP and to a lesser extent PvE. One of the main priorities is to cultivate an environment that increases enjoyment and to gather like-minded individuals that wish to experience the game in a relaxed and stress-free community of friendship. For more information check out our Discord server or contact me here, on Discord (Shiki#7820) or ingame.
---
https://discord.gg/A8U2AhE
---
They did not confirm this.
---
I agree, but i can still hold out hope
---
Never to early to start.  Youre ALMOST to the dungeons that drop Pre Raid gear.   So if no one else in the group needs it, I say go for it.   You gotta start somewhere anyway.
---
i was pretty happy about it ngl, people are joining me
---
Exactly. Yes its just a game, but thats real life time and effort down the drain, and that doesnt feel good
---
Agree 100%. Also, they're clearly being open and honest about reserves prior to invites, so anyone joining is fully aware. No issue there
---
Don't know if it exists updated but DrDamage add-on used to display that info.
---
If you’re not going shadowform, and healing instead, than ya it’s not a bad option to have a shadowweave priest.
---
A shadowweave priest though, is not a shadow priest. You’re not going deep into shadow, and you’re not going to be dps. Your job is to stack shadowweave and then heal the raid. No shadowform is required ever.
---
Wouldn't hurt since no one else needs leather int gear really.
---
How are normal members meant to trust the leadership this early in to raiding? It takes at least a year to build solid relationships on here, DKP is better for most guilds imo.
---
Nice vid! One question though.. how do you get out? Suicide and corpse run?
---
Hey man, you do you.  I'm not here to judge.
---
yes and no
---
The only persons that should have rolled need on that is the warrior and rogue. What the fuck.
---
Sorry not now but there should be a few.
---
I play a Warrior with a seemingly normal 31/0/0 Arms spec (Level 41 atm). I'm missing all the time.  
---
It's kind of the same in instances when using a one hand weapon.
---
My weapon skills are mostly maxed (i.e 203/205 for example, in the current tier of 5 per level).
---
Any ideas? Is this normal?  
---
I've not seen much +hit gear, otherwise the solution would be clear
---
surely split 70/30 servers
---
30% servers stay TBC
---
70% of servers go WOTLK
---
To add:
---
1. Self res (once per hour get out of wipe free card)
---
2. 5x as many hearthstones as everyone else
---
3. Ghost wolf
---
4. Be a healer that can take some hits
---
5. FROST SHOCK! (while running, instant cast nuke that slows opponent
---
5. Fun utility spells like far sight and water walking
---
6. Windfury might be the most satisfying thing ever
---
Some of the BiS items come from lower level dungeons, so you always want to keep an eye out for them.
---
But always check with your healer before you take any items that they might need.
---
I've gotten a couple of whispers when I was halfway across the continent from the dungeon lol
---
It's the only loot system that can reach near perfection, but under the requirement that it is fully transparent and honest.
---
The problem is not of system design, it's corruption and greed.
---
The alternative systems have other flaws, as in being unfair and factoring certain stuff too heavily.
---
Ayo
---
Because you die after.
---
not even that rare
---
A "badass" head for a special snowflake :-)

This obviously transcends my character’s face.. how do you feel about benign QoL changes being put into the game?

Assumed you’d pick up on that. .

50 rogue here and i am curious now too.
---
I love the idea of shamans except I don’t like putting down totems. The mix between meele and caster is very nice though.
---
So what? Upvote/downvote for quality control, and move on.
---
I'm speechless
---
hi all. shadow priest here and im level 57. what is a good place to mindlessly grind mobs? mobs that are somewhat packed together? thanks!
---
How is going for arcane instability and critical mass at level 60?
---
I'm soon hitting 60 but I've never raided in my life. What do I expect? How are raids made up right now? I imagine it to be a chaos just because of the sheer number of people. I'm going to be a healer, by the way.
---
Leveling a warrior is brutal I would recommend lock mage or hunter
---
was asked to join a guild's 2nd night in MC this week, (they had 11 sub 60's in mc  last night) but was told loot would go to guild memebers 1st,
---
Lol he's gonna reroll tank and still not be able to find groups cause hes a dickhead
---
Thanks, that’s a super good meme XD lol (epic)
---
Rogue!
---
Correct it's 10
---
LF4M Tank + Healer + DPS Angerforge runs HoJ reserved!
---
I was wondering when I would see this on Reddit.  I'm a 40 priest you asked for an escort from Badlands.  Brings a tear to my eye seeing you made it.
---
Clever! Ty
---
Doesn't matter what you reserve. If you don't like runs with stuff being reserved don't join. The guy whispering you is just a stupid person in general.
---
Make sure you aren't fighting mobs higher level than you.  In general all classes except hunters benefit from fighting mobs 2-4 levels low than them when leveling.
---
just curious, how is it different from how it worked back then? i played but it's been too long.
---
Definitely start collecting gear as soon as you can. The one caveat is communicate with your party what you plan to roll on. It can be frustrating seeing the tank roll on gear for off-spec. The fairest for your party is to agree ahead of time what you'll be rolling for because its very frustrating when druids roll on literally everything for different specs.
---
I'm not some no-lifer ganking in duskwood or stonetalon. Running a priest friend through BFD and a horde group felt like trying to kill him. It worked because of the fears.

Ony/MC attunement when you can is it. That and gearing.
---
Literally terrifying
---
sure but you probably would say vendor sellable in that case
---
Well the point is more runs = higher chance of getting it. Can’t get a hoj to drop sitting in org spamming trade. Wish you the best of luck getting hoj before it’s replaceable
---
No paladin trainer in Darnassus, though. There is a druid trainer in SW.
---
Its the tooltip window that gets in your way right? 
---
I used aadon -move anything- 
---
I moved my tooltip window to top middle of screen. Good position. 
---
Google or youtube it
---
Grind out BRD for your BiS gear arena/angerforge/golem are great for warriors. While looking for your gear you will eventually hit 60.
---
Hunter is a very fun experience. Sure, you can just play auto shot and afk with your pet, but if you want to be efficient and have more fun you should be chain pulling 2-4 mobs at a time, balancing between you, your pet, and kiting.
---
In PvP each fight is about using your tools to maintain distance, it is a very interesting playstyle.
---
Going 20 into shadow for shadowweave only would just be the optimal way to have a shadow priest in the raid. 
---
It’s certainly fine to have a full shadow priest in a 40 man raid when guilds can pretty easily do MC and Ony with just 30 people. But if you’re trying to min/max then I’d avoid a full shadow priest.
---
I remember reading that you needed something like at least 3 or possibly more warlocks to get any benefit from a shadowweave priest compared to just bringing another pure dps class. But no idea where I read that and very likely from private server testing.
---
All i ever want as a rogue is someone to tank or heal me. Druid does both ;).
---
As an alchemist, I encourage everyone to strive for this level of over preparation
---
Horde defector here. Rolling a human mage and has noticed a... lack in useful rewards? As horde I feel like I got loads of gear from Barrens, RFC, WC, SFK... As alliance I barely find anything useful for my class. Where are all the rewards? DM and Stockades barely drop anything either.
---
Back in the day, this was the reason I started a Mage. Been playing one since day 1, and here I am again, playing a Mage for those same reasons.
---
yeah that is true actually
---
You still can't have Horde and Ally on same server. Not sure how they started cooperating but they have kept the price of the Devilsaur set over 400g.
---
&gt; before it’s replaceable
---
You mean when Nax is out?
---
If a loot council/leadership sucks people leave. It isn't sustainable and guild health suffers-- especially without cross-realm because a reputation matters. It shouldn't take a player long to figure out if they're getting a fair shake or not.

I think he meant server subreddit
---
Lock works well since you can throw a hot on them, they can tap freely, and keep trucking through mobs without breaking
---
90% of the time they also kill rotgrip(?)and the goblin too. The reason why you only pay when the ring drops is because they are already looting every other item. For them selling a ring is just a boost in profit on their standard maraudon farmruns.
---
They way you can pull mobs now with eye of kilrogg isn't the same as vanilla is it? 
---
I could have sworn if something aggroed my eye in vanilla it would just run back to spawn if the eye died, not come find me after.
---
You create the group, you make the rules. 
---
If you don't like it, you don't join.

---
I can't figure out if this is just another insane stunt by him being done to raise money again for kids in Africa. This dude is mental.  
---
Are there any other sources regarding this? I want to dig deeper.
---
Is someone forcing you to join those runs?
---
So defend them messing up raid exp, and then nerfing warlocks eye of kilrog because they were used in a broken meta that wasn’t intended. Or did the phrasing literally trigger you off a bridge.
---
This. And Look up for dungeon quests for dungeons you need to go for your raid pre bis.
---
No. As a lvl 32 warlock, Voidwalker has been my most used pet since lvl 10. Succubus will be my new full time pet once I get Dark Pact. This is because succubus uses physical dmg and can conserve her mana for me to tap into, once I get the skill at the bottom of the Affliction tree. You want to get the Grims on your voidwalker until Succubus becomes full time. Sacrifice and consume shadows are very useful when soloing.
---
It’s bad but without census addons you can only speculate
---
Grats on nearing the home stretch. 50-60 seems like you're almost there but the can be some of the most painful levels to get through. Prepare to live in BRD until you know that place better than your own home.  
---
In addition to what the other posters have said about rag/ony attune as far as quests go, definitely do the quests to get dungeon keys. 
---
Mara: you will most likely spend a lot of time farming Princess Theredeas to get Blackstone ring, as this is BiS pre-raid for many classes.  Having the scepter to teleport there directly will be extremely useful. 
---
BRD: you will probably be doing angerforge runs to get your Hand of Justice (good luck with that). Having the Shadowforge key on hand is the fastest, most efficient route to get in and out quickly. 
---
UBRS, strat, scholo are also useful keys to have in your bag for gearing up. UBRS can be more difficult due to competition for the needed items, so probably best to start working on it as soon as you can.
---
It had less, and they were different.
---
Funny how cringey people get over virtual items. You can raid in shit gear so long as people are willing to let you join. WotLK had maybe a handful of raids that some decent gear was even required. This is why I can't even bother anymore. Between the requirements and ninja looters you're going to be left out and all the time you spend will be spent gearing some dudes buddy so the next big raid that comes around, you're not invited because of gear score.
---
Drama on Arugal? Ya don't say.
---
What do you use to zoom in and out?
---
No you run to Golem Lord as a healer to get yourself Second Wind. Casters will join for the Belt in arena. Casters and healers want the boots that drop off Golem Lord as well. A healer joining a Arena/Anger only run is likely there to help a friend.
---
Plenty of warriors will want their shot at Savage Gladiator Chain.

The low drop rate holds for both a reserve group and a spam group. The threshold for whether it's worth it from a purely selfish standpoint is simple. If forming a reserve group takes over n times longer than it takes to form a spam group with n people who would roll on HoJ, then it's not worth it. Adjust according to how many people you think will roll on it. Also consider that, if you form the group, you have some control over who joins. Sure, if you're not a tank, you'll need one, and he'll probably roll on HoJ, but you can get casters for the rest. On the other hand, good luck getting a tank to join a group with HoJ reserved.

Being an Alliance first player but having played both sides, Horde seem to care A LOT more than Alliance. God forbid you say to use Hero in a Horde raid instead of Lust, they'll ridicule you forever. If you say to Lust in an Alliance raid no one cares. Lol.

---
A tank willing to run Arena/Anger/Golem while reserving HoJ for themselves will have no problem forming a group.

DPS trying to form a group to reserve HoJ is an entirely different story.

Haven't heard much good about mace builds, and stuns (from Mace Spec.) don't work on bosses.

Without knowing the proc rate of the extra attack from Ironfoe it's impossible to know how viable it is, but I'd say it's safe (and some sims suggest it better) to use Thrash Blade and sword spec.

Pagle.  It's a PvE server.  Allegedly it's 70% alliance, but that's just "word on the street", I haven't seen any numbers on it myself.
---
I just know that the lobby was always packed so I kept hoping I'd find a mage to bum/buy some water off of, and very rarely did I see any Horde out there.
---
&gt;It’s certainly fine to have a full shadow priest in a 40 man raid when guilds can pretty easily do MC and Ony with just 30 people. But if you’re trying to min/max then I’d avoid a full shadow priest.
---
Yeah, atm we have 5 warlocks, so this will really bring damage to the raid, but as I said, I don't want to go as a min/max shadow weave as it will hinder my capability for farming. That's why I want to know if my healing will be at least acceptable, right now I have full pre raid bis and a few MC gear, probably soon will get bene weapon.
---
Let me rephrase what I wanted to say: get out of this guild.
---
Where can i find bis lists? I tried looking up preraid bis for holy paladin and couldnt find anything other than the .5 tier armor which is apparently not good for healing

Complain on your server that dudes a ninja looter and no one will group with him. That’s pretty much all I got for you.

What is yours

Or you just look at your group composition and make enough food/water for the group before you get to the dungeon and save everyone time.

Just lost a roll on corehound tooth to a hunter, im a dagger rogue. I argued it was just a trinket/statstick for him while I actually need it for offhand dps. Currently running something not even close. Raid leader and hunter got pissy with me for trying to call him out, AITA?
---
Not even remotely close to accurate imo
---
Nerf paladins
---
I agree with you, fellow member of the Alliance
---
Loot council is THE best system you can have, as long as your council is not a bag of dicks.
---
So in a lot of guilds it sucks, but nothing beats it in order to progress the quickest.
---
Multibillion company that rerelease his own game vs a few guys recreating the game in their garage as a hobby, who would make the less bugged experience ?
---
Deadmines has a staff, wand, and ring for mages. The staff is useful up to like lvl 30.
---
Stockades has a worse staff but also has int on it, but really nothing else for mages.
---
There are some decent quests in darkshore and ashenvale to run and some have good rewards for druids that translate to good for mages
---
Yup shit is dumb, no one is going to pay that much for items for their alts yet because not one has a huge amount of gold to blow on an upgrade, that’ll change eventually when there’s more gold in the market but it’s ridiculous that I have to give up incredibly rare drops that are amazing for me just because one guys wants a little extra gold
---
Basically the idea was that pure dps classes should do the most damage, and the only true pure tanking spec should be the only tank. Also- the early raiding content could be completed by just having enough bodies really. We always carried a lot of dead weight, but we were having fun and killing bosses, so we didn't care.
---
Your a priest. Same as me. Yeah I can chalk it up to luck I guess, half the time someone whispers me and I'm just like yeah man let me get there.  On top of that only 1 ninja tried me way back in deadmines but I won the roll. Warrior rolling on cooking stirring rod
---
Mount from baron, strat

Why would it not let you link items? You can do that in any channel, as far as I know.

i played in cata with so called loot council with very simple rules BiS 1st going to Tank then Healer, whats left dps is picking/rolling for and everyone was happy but there was 15 of us only.

I'd try opening a ticket, whether a deliberate ninja or legitimate accident, all of the text / roll info will support that it should have been your belt.
---
I'm just unsure at which point the "bad luck" line is drawn in the sand, but worth finding out
---
I guess.  There is nothing that factions do vs one another that actually matters in the game though.  Having paladin tanks in PVP isn't going to matter much, and in PVE it's only going to matter if you are trying to world first something.
---
Enchanting is also super helpful to have
---
you don't always have control over it unfortunately 
---
a dumb ass pull by someone else, healer that stops healing you all of a sudden or misses a heal or whatever the fuck happens sometimes when you die and healer still has 40% mana or one of the other 20 things that can go wrong without any input by you as a tank 
---
You will still get all the blame as the tank though.
---
Back in vanilla full druid raids used to down ony and rag. 2 druids is all good
---
And you can both pounce through ashenvale like it's the fucking lion king
---
AQ but you missed the joke.
---
Yeah I agree. My realm is still busy at peak hours so not sure I’ll have a problem or not but hopefully Blizzard will fix those that do with moves or merges.
---
Lol imagine thinking wrath is cool when judgement exists.
---
When you link an item in general chat it is not clickable after.
---
"No problem friendo!"
---
Nothing to do about it.
---
I seriously doubt anyone would ninja a random blue item ... Either he really was "high af" or he had something against the dude
---
Only ask in dungeons or like jintha’alor
---
For us usually the pugs are the rare classes. Druids. Rogues (somehow rare in classic). A few locks. So they have a reaaaally high chance at gear.
---
If that’s true, the people doing retail classes must be students, 2nd grade students.
---
Imo it depends on how they worded the cancelling the raid. The raid leader tells all the PuGs the raid is cancelled and they won't be having inviting any of them back until next week? 
---
Either the guild is screwing the pugs over because they got more guildies to 60 or they aren't finishing and it's up for grabs. If you contact everyone you can from the previous raid and try to put that group together you're golden.
---
They said the raid time is cancelled that particular night? Then the raid is not up for grabs and you should contact them about when they're continuing it.
---
hate this cross faction wholesomeness.. wtf, kill each other!  RED = DEAD
---
His name’s Steve.
---
I guess you misunderstood his point
---
“We don’t do that here” - Blizzard
---
I think the difference is you probably killed a few more mobs than him. Even if you guys were grouped up there might have been times when you were out of range of each other and you got the full XP for the kill. I think the 5 extra XP you’re getting now can be contributed to the level difference.
---
There isn't a lot they can't do, that's for sure.
---
On the whole they are given to the crafter on the Stipulation that they are required to make fire ress gear for raider that supply their own mats. E.g. if a warrior wants dark iron leggings he gives the correct crafter 16 dark iron bars and in return the crafter is to give him a set of dark iron leggings. 
---
Now, let’s not be coy, sometimes the ‘crafted by’ is not the same person as the crafter given the mats but that doesn’t matter as it is an important life lesson to individuals, who suddenly need to spend a lot of their own gold buying a set of dark iron leggings because they stupidly sold/used their cores for someone outside of the guild.
---
Good idea! Now, what about the attack animations?
---
No idea. Does shared xp vary by how much dmg you do?
---
During Vanilla my friend and I logged onto each other's accounts for years and nothing happened. We lived in the same city though, so some of those times was actually the real account owner logging on at someone else's house. Blizzard has no way to verify whether it's you logging on at your friend's house (which is not against the rules) or your friend logging on at your friend's house. However that's because we were not multi-boxing. 
---
If your friend lives in another country, then they will assume it's not you (even if it is) and that could get you banned.
---
Stunlock has no diminishing returns for a rogue, so you tell me where the balance is, I think it's good
---
My atlas loot doesn’t tell me drop %
---
I wish there was an add-on or functionality that lets you squelch people for a period of time (1 hr, 4 hrs, 24 hrs).
---
He had less rest (probably didnt log out in the inn), you dinged first, he got an exp penalty for being in a party with a higher level.
---
Some people just don’t have any fuckin manners
---
There is a bis addon that shows you what u need and what u got
---
&gt;The only reason I joined was, as I said, because he said "Sellables reserved". If you consider a Tier set, be it BoE, that is obviously going to be an upgrade for most people in the raid, a Sellable then I don't know what to say.
---
Literally read. The problem is that the rules were shady at best.
---
just wash the inside of the broccoli too
---
Well thats a fucking lie because the system in place guarantees at least one person gets a drop from a boss.
---
I did golem about 10x and seen it 2x both me and pali had it.
---
You're probably looking at this wrong.
---
People joining you in MC probably lack any dedicated MC slot, and you need people to come to your guild MC.
---
After the raid, Individually whisper everyone who joins, if you think they'll fit of course, and just tell them your guild is looking for more members, and let you know if they're interested and enjoyed the raid.
---
This is what WoW is all about
---
Plus, if you're on a PvP server it's a really good tool for recruiting and retaining some of the best PvP'ers on the server for your faction.
---
I promise you this will pay off at times when you have raid vs. raid battles on the way to and through BRM and later on, the gates of AQ.  Getting wiped and then camped on your way in takes away from the raid time you have allocated and strips you of your buffs.
---
One of my old guilds had a couple rank 14 tryhards who would raid lead on the way to the raids and coordinate us during those PvP skirmishes and we came out victorious more often than not.  You get some pretty sick results when everyone in the raid has a couple EZ-thro dynamites and FAPs on hand.  Hell of a morale boost too when you wipe some other guild and then go on to have a smooth run through a BWL + MC night.
---
seems like bullshit if you ask anyone with half a brain cell
---
Can you explain the fuckery that could come from this? I don’t know much about rogues
---
Wait, so you took this route?  
---
Blasted Lands into Swamp of Sorrows into Duskwood into Redridge Mountains into Burning Steppes into Badlands into Loch Modan into Dun Morogh into Ironforge.  
---
That's a hell of kite, gj.
---
I met an ally farming felcloth, we killed each other for an hour, end.
---
It's actually only 79 into Revered. Started quests at 11'999 honored, and only got more rep after first quest

In mage aoe groups paladins are the only viable tank, doing true aoe damage and reduced threat for others

No raid needs to be split over multiple days, ESP pug raids, ESP Molten Core. That shit can be cleared in 2h, 3MAX with 40 people in trash gear. If it needs to split, then that ID is open season IMO. 20 skilled people can clear it FFS.
---
Did 7 runs for it
---
It gets people's attention though. Which is the point. Look how much discussion and attention has been brought to it. I understand you being angry but that's the entire purpose. If you can't see that there is no reason to discuss it further.
---
I was in BRD so much from 52-60. It was only after getting 60 and on my third day of dedicated runs that I finally got mine.  It's an awful drop rate for sure
---
I would say most classes are fun in pvp, special shoutouts to warlock, mage, rogue and priest (and ele shaman every 3 minutes).
---
I’m a warlock with skinning and was in ST PUG group with a Druid. I have skinning and skinned some dragon whelps and he got upset saying that he’s a leather worker so all skinning should be his because he needs it for gear and I’m just doing it for profit. 
---
Is that normal? I was thinking I could take some leather or is is more “need over greed”?
---
I am using classic wow live's guide to quickly get my Warrior to 40 (I am at 13 after 10 hours of playtime). Will I miss out on much by not reading quests and questing in this unnatural way?

---
I've seen it drop twice and I have only killed golem lord a handful of times, probably just bad luck
---
Honestly I don’t think they intended to have the game be balanced.
---
Pvp balance acts like a rock paper scissors game. Pve balance is really more like each class provides something to the fight. Some classes provide damage, some classes provide buffs. Pally buffs are so strong that in a 40 man raid group the buffs alone make them worth taking and outweigh damage/lack of damage.
---
Binding reserved in a pug? Totally normal. IDK if I’ve ever seen a pug with binding on freeroll.
---
I mean would be as with any class but for example one rogue talent is to reset all cool downs.
---
hat's off, major zing
---
here's a good start: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow

lol Warlock is the only class you should play. No other class comes close.
---
Holy shit. You people are the same that complained about layering and how people got thousands of gold because of it right? Abusing the system. This is literally abusing the people for the same god damn thing. But if he states, in a very misleading way, the "rules" then it's ok. Holy fuck i gotta stop actually replying to all you fucktards. Hypocrisy at it's finest.
---
I literally just had a roll with FFA on.
---
The ID belongs to whatever player can finish the run. Even a guild run that pugs a single player does not belong to the guild if that solo player can make a group and finish it.
---
until you know exactly what you are doing you should absolutely never use fear in a dungeon.
---
If you have a priest/pally in the group who can resurrect you should even let yourself die before using fear unless you are last man standing
---
It's an ongoing joke to someone on Bloodsail they have been randomly kiting this dragon across azeroth and leaving him places. Last week it was the entrance to blackrock mtn this week it was placed on the lvl 10 warrior quest in Elwynn. For some reason or another he isn't aggressive so u can ignore him.
---
Would you mind telling us, what you think is wrong with that piece of code? Looks pretty good to me. All closing tags are there, no typos in the tags, the void tags look proper. I have no idea why it isn't rendering properly, but the HTML is fine.
---
And besides, I (and many other people I know) mess up simple code way more than complex code. Complex code requires a lot of concentration, simple code is often written without even thinking about it.
---
Having it perma is way too OP. It's literally an over 20% dps increase for any warrior.
---
&gt; and Balthazarion
---
And a hell of a lot spam in all world channels...
---
Pretty sure dwarven boomstick fishing does an equiverlent amount of environmental damage.
---
It's just really rare. Don't trust websites droprates.
---
It's pretty easy to if you're paying attention. The mage was slow.
---
Yeah.  If edgemasters drops for example, I can’t fault people for rolling need.  I get it.  It’s worth too much.
---
But a 10g shield?  Throw your tank a bone.  I do the same shit for blacksmith and other recipes.  I’ll do it for mage gear.
---
I just won’t tank for people like that.
---
Good luck replacing it in AQ. 5% drop chance and 15 people are going to roll on it.
---
The journey of a thousand miles starts with one step. 
---
I feel bad for you that you think it's useless.
---
its pretty sad but I spent a combined total of over 10 hours over 2 days on this raid and then the rl cancels the raid when we log on for when he told us we were continuing.
---
Then to top it off when I tried to organise the raid today, he took his guild and went inside mc to farm trash so we couldn't go in :)))
---
Level 51, devilsaur gloves
---
I guess its plausible. I think the whole thing stems from a kind of confusion. Blizzard is not capable, I don't think, of reviewing a "tape" of the gameplay you're being reported for if you get mass reported. So if people *think* what you're doing in a neutral town isn't supposed to be allowed (just ganking while cleverly avoiding the guards but not actually exploiting) and they report you, Blizzard probably doesn't have time to go back and sort out exactly what you were doing and distinguish it from actual exploiting where you get up on some shitty piece of terrain where the guards can't path to you and evade. I don't really do much neutral town ganking so I guess I'm not really worried about this.
---
You never know, even undead rogues can be honorable. Back in the day on my UD rogue I did loads of pvp but had a strict code to leave people lower level alone. 
---
Now I cant say I didnt go into STV with my 29 twink UD rogue and murder people 10 levels above me for hours. There was sport in those hunts though and it was never a camp out to keep one guy down.
---
Yep. Kindness or just plain manners will often be responded to with kindness and generosity. Too bad more folks aren’t like you.
---
well only those who need should need, if you use need before greed and someone ninjas you 100% can report them because they go against the games loot rules
---
I must be a HoJ lucky charm but ive run BRd about 12 times and ive seen Hoj drop about 4 of em.
---
Gehennas EU is packed even during "quiet" hours. Had like 6 hours queue today.
---
I had someone from the opposite faction circle around me when I did it, while he was spamming /ponder and /laugh  
---
He didn't touch any of us :)
---
I blame modern wow on the players. Blizzard knew what they wanted in vanilla. And the classes showed it. But then people decided only min maxing was ok. Paladins. Priests. Druids. Shamans. They were all trash to the raiders and pvpers unless they were doing one thing. 
---
So people started quitting. Servers started dying. Pvp became a game of warriors vs mages and which side had more. 
---
I'll agree that they went to far though. Bc/wrath was almost perfect.
---
And someone got knocked up by it! Rag must be really fertile.
---
Oh I guess I misunderstood. I see what he meant now.
---
dude cheers rp-pvp is the only way to go, its epic
---
it is more that i have gone and grinded for 3 hours come back to town find the same guy with the same spam and not gotten a group for the run together.
---
it is just so darn stubborn and stupid. it is better to just get runs in when you need more than 2 items.
---
Water I get it.  I take time to create a bunch of stacks for when I get a group.  
---
Portals for free - when the stone costs more than 1 gold a pop?  No, portals I’m charging.
---
it's not bugged/broken, its as intended.
---
I love how people think something is bugged/broken because it doesn't drop the first few times they run an instance lol.
---
This is how it is intended to be, if you want the game to be easy, go play retail.

You can just search "athene logic" anywhere, its not hidden or covered up. Hes pretty open about the fact hes not raising any money for anyone but his own cult. Hes spending all "his" money (the money he is conning people out of, by selling their homes and personal possessions) on the compound and promoting his "logic" "philosophy". Which is just a religious cult with him as the figure head since he is the most logical being in the world, according to himself. The way he rationalizes this is by pretending like somehow promoting his cult helps the most people by letting them understand "logic" and will lead to them living their lives based on the "objective reality", which in turn somehow provides "good" to the world. How any of this actually works in practice is never talked about.

Hmm.. Magenta Cap Sickness. Good shit.
---
Yo great stuff man!  What did you use to make this machinima?
---
I love this type of recruiting the most: “Princess Run LF2M Tank Healer, Invocaters Blade NOT reserved!”
---
Reserve looting bad.
---
LF4M healer + caster dps angerforge runs.
---
I don't remember people reserving shit in pugs in vanilla.  
---
Now it is getting ridiculous.  Maybe it's the younger entitled generation? I understand reserving loot in guild runs. For pugs, it's childish and stupid.
---
I want to run lbrs for xbow. I'm a lvl 59 hunter. Everytime I try to go some idiot reserves the xbow. Logged in today for 10 min, every strat or lbrs run had reserved loot so I said fuck it and logged off. 
---
 The Xbow in ud strat dropped last night, and a warrior won the need roll.  Ppl complain about hunter, but I am always respectful to not roll over other classes. Seen HOJ dropp 4 times now. Even tho its bis i never roll on it. I'm considering not giving a shit abour other people and just rolling on what i need, because that's what others have been doing to me. 
---
Instead of defaultly complaining about hunters and blaming us for everything, maybe take a look at yourself?
---
Considering quitting until bg come out. This new generation of gamers is ridiculous. I hadn't touched a game since vanilla wow. It's changed a lot.
---
Maybe in your private servers but on retail both of those would be against rules (griefing and cross-faction collusion).
---
It's a mages job to supply water/food for free.
---
If they don't, they are getting kicked from the dungeon/raid and getting blacklisted on the server.
---
&gt;The idea of "a healer per X number of people" seams comforting. 
---
Yeah it's not really reasonable to expect every healer to manage the health of 39 other players.
---
What you'll find is that typically the main tank/offtanks have a healer or two assigned, then the rest of the the healers are given groups to look after. It gets tricky if your group or another group is dying, and you should help out if you can, but in general you want to stick to your group because they're relying on you. 
---
&gt;You mentioned discord - do all raid-members always participate? I'm playing on EU, don't know whether I can pull off talking in English for that long.
---
I've gone to 3~ MC full clears, and 4~ Onyxia clears and never once spoken on Discord.
---
I just use it to listen to what the raid leaders are saying, I don't mind speaking but it's easier for me to type it out most of the time to avoid talking over 2-3 people. I prefer text-based chatting in WoW, but I understand that it's necessary to go over plans in Discord and be able to issue instructions immediately so I think it's mostly vital to at least listen in for raids. 
---
&gt;And also by "how raids are made up" I meant, are they all PUGs right now? But then what about loot? Is it just 40 people rolling?
---
I'd say it's mostly guilds, with a handful of PUG's right now. Plus it's pretty common for guilds to ask randoms to join their run if the numbers aren't up to scratch.
---
As for loot, there are typically three ways to distribute loot. The first two are generally for guild-only runs, while the last is for PuG/mixed groups.
---
Loot Council: Basically the leaders of the guild/raid get together when something drops, and give it to the person they feel deserves it the most. This is generally a long-term approach, main tanks and healers will typically get the best gear first, then DPS and other roles. The only way this method really works is if everyone trusts the loot council, as there have been claims of favoritism many times in the past with this loot distribution method. My guild uses this method and I feel it's reasonably fair, sure it sucks when one mage gets 3 pieces of Arcanist in one run, but because they need it for the set bonus, it's better for the guild. When your 'turn' comes to get geared, you'll find that the epics do start falling frequently in your direction. 
---
DKP: The DKP system is an old system, basically you get 'points' for certain actions and hours spent raiding. Examples are like "1 point per hour of raiding", "1 point per downed boss", "5 points per boss downed for the first time", "1 point for bringing X fire resistance potions" etc. When an item drops, the points are used to 'bid' on something, and it essentially rewards players that consistently keep attending raids and contributing. There are downsides/upsides to this method, one downside is that you can spend something like 50+hours of raiding on one item, then the next week it drops again and someone gets it for like 5~ hours because there isn't as much interest. The good part of this is that players that raid often will be able to get the items they want regardless of how good it is for them as long as they're willing to spend the points.  
---
Rolling: This is the loot system used whenever there's randoms in the raid that likely will not be part of the Loot Council/DKP system, so in order to be fair, everyone just rolls on what they want and the highest roller gets it.
---
Yeah I dont get those people. I mean if no one would ever join a grp. with anything on lock, no one would lock something...
---
I dont join any grp. in which ANYTHING is locked, even if I dont need it. Its that simple :)
---
I love beards mate. And they have a good racial for pvp as well. But it just doesn’t appeal to me. In rift mathosian female has the best attack animations for dual wield.
---
This is going to be the last reroll from me. And I don’t want to mess it up. I have a good idea of what classes I want to play this time, however same cannot be said about the race. I kinda liked my male undead rogues attack animation, had a pretty cool dance emote as well. It’s the troll hunter that disgusted me, the only reason I played on it was because I had friends with me, and now they left. 
---
I also have a good idea about the horde story line, so alliance would be quite refreshing. You can only finish the barrens x number of times on multiple toons in a month before you get burned out.
---
Shamans are viable tanks, so it would be pretty even.
---
He conned his GF into naming their dog "Stitches" so now it hates him and he has to keep reminding himself to keep his distance or it will take its revenge.
---
Small price to pay in my opinion :)
---
I find it interesting how vocal Horde players are about this...it definitely is both factions that participate. I think it's a right of passage getting ganked by higher level players.
---
Dire Maul is going to obsolete half your healing preraid bis anyway, so just wait for that.
---
that is world pvp, what else can you call it
---
The WYRP guild name is a close guarded secret. You will never know unless you sleep with the GM.
---
If you don't care about the lore it'll be fine, play how you want
---
I love being an oceanic player for reasons like this.
---
Sorry but you're just wrong.
---
Paladins are THE best dungeon tanks, period.
---
That's what new players need to realise. Classic, unlike Retail, isn't balanced around raids. It's balanced around all five major activities:
---
- Levelling
---
- Dungeons
---
- Raids
---
- WPVP
---
- BGs
---
Take Druids as another example. They are god-tier levellers and flag runners. They would be flat out broken if they were god-tier ranged DPS in raids too (as an example).
---
I never asked you to join my group, and neither did anyone else, they offered to let you.
---
/r/attentionwhores
---
You sound like the type to poke a bear then be mad when it rips you apart
---
Stop fucking with people and you won't get reported
---
The second story btw sounds ridiculous I've done that multiple times myself (also a mage) never had an issue being reported
---
Just reserve it bro
---
We had Teremus just outside SW at half road to Goldshire Inn my first week of WoW Classic. (Ashbringer EU) I started    yelling about how the end was near, to concede to the eternal flames of the Devourer, to be sacrificed to his cause. A small group of people gathered and it was quite the experience. (Especially because i was not a priest but a rogue)

he didnt want the hammer, he wanted the mats to sell for gold.

Whenever a "skull" level comes near my level 30 something mage I Polymorph them. It hasn't been resisted yet, and I've done it at least 10 times. I don't even have the arcane hit talent.  
---
Something is definately not right.
---
Do you know how often horde gank low level alliance? Every time they see one
---
Shamans are not viable tanks after leveling content.
---
Similar thing happened while running BFD. Healer didn't get the staff he wanted as the mage rolls a higher number. The healer drops one line saying how shit the mage is and how he has really bad gear... i guess he didn't understand the purpose of doing dungeons. Out of anger the healer just leaves the group before the last boss. Resulting in another 30 minute to find replacements for people who left. Good times.
---
Still possible. If I was DPS trying to res HoJ, I’d probably try forming a full group. 2 chances for HoJ to drop, and depending on your route, there’s plenty of loot for others to go after. Especially a tank wanting Ironfoe
---
I'm sorry what? I literally messaged you to ask if this content was fine and you said it was, and now you just randomly ban it? It's a world pvp event not anything that you listed on there is correlated
---
Uh, do you mean Dire Maul?

Exactly, and that means he has to re-install all the mods again, AND find the right install order.

My god that rogue was probably steaming

If you're going to remove my comment, please remove the multiple comments from this guy calling people retards, et cetera.
---
If you're looking far an addon that automatically loots with clicking on the corpse you're out of luck, similarly if you want to loot multiple mobs at once.
---
That's QoL changes that were added in legion or cata and wont be implemented in classic nor will the API support addons to do so.
---
Also, no matter what the party that gets kill cred will be the one that can loot so out of party powerleveling wont allow for loot either.

What level range you in? Stv last night seemed pretty poppin and I saw a lot of Horde in the Hillsbrad/Arathi area
---
I think last census has a 2:1 alliance favored with a staggering amount more alliance 60’s than Horde 60’s. Hope it gets better in time
---
Hello to all the redditors in the year 2021 who came to check out the all-time top post in this sub
---
I will not shut up. What you are saying is utter nonsense! 
---
But amuse me, tell me why extra choice is bad?
---
I dare you to be level 35 alliance and try to quest in stv lol
---
Just because you sound nice and arent using "bad words" doesnt mean youre being nice or respectful, youre talking to people as if theyre laying on the floor.
---
Yeah that edit didnt make it any better.
---
Whats a better staff of a mage Zum'rah's vexing cane (10int,10 Stam, Up to 21 damage on spells) or Argent Crusader (30 intm, 6 stam, 10 spirit)?
---
Thanks. Yea I took all the screen shots. Il try a ticket but I dont think GMs or customer service can transfer an item even if by accident. Worth a shot :/
---
Ya that’s really lucky. I ran it probably around 10-15 times as a healer. Got my second wind, hammer, pants, and boots plus some other gear. Never saw HoJ drop.
---
you have to be there when the "completed" message pops up.
---
Haha what a transformation ;) I feel that though. I wouldn’t have bat an eye killing lowbies back in vanilla. 
---
I agree! I’d say so too 😎
---
Did my first 4 man spell cleave group in sm library last night and it was pretty great. I'm in the same boat as you though where I'll take whatever group wants me, so if I can get one, cool, if not I'm going in tank/dps/healer like I do every other group
---
I'd level two droods. Maybe have one spec into tanking an the other into DPS. Or healing and you'll just be able to create dungeon groups without anyone saying "I don't want a druid tank" "no! You shut up!"
---
It's the younger generation of entitled millenials. Anybody who played vanilla knows this.
---
Damn, mate. Your animations are super smooth. Excellent work.
---
Macros emoting is easy. Make a macro that just says what you want to tell them in the orange text
---
Can you place BoE on the AH to sell? Or is that even a thing....
---
Sorry but you went off what you felt he meant and did not bother to clarify. You fucked up and are salty about it learn from **your** mistakes.
---
Sellable means sellable. Why does it matter if its a upgrade?? It is **sellable**
---
I wasn't the one complaining, just pointing out that your excuse made zero sense.
---
I was obviously too far away, collecting blue leaf tubers 😭 will just do it again at 30 for the going going guano quest too, I guess.
---
by chance were you able to find a conclusion to this? I'm actually having the same issue
---
Haha get fucked pronkers
---
Already preparing a /yell macro "Don't help me, doing a quest" to spam for when I'll (hopefully) get around doing that.

A mighty hunter guided me instead. But the Frostmane shall not forget your bravery.

Imo the best is a combo of both systems. 
---
"DKP with limited loot council"
---
* Loot council things like the Bindings to tanks, BRE/Spinal Reaper to warriors how are serious about ranking, Ony head to Tanks first, Mana igniting Cord to mages only, etc. 
---
* You still charge a set amount of DKP for the LC'd items, like 50DKP (with the ability to go negative on LC items only) per or w/e you feel is reasonable. 
---
* Then DKP everything else (trials can only bid up to 10DKP, off-spec raider only up to 20DKP, Main spec raider no limit)
---
You have offhand? Grats if true.
---
I agree with the idea to create a new battle.net account and keep horde characters just in case. For alliance I prefer human rogue for aesthetics, animations, sword specialization, and reputation increase for getting nightsaber mount.
---
If you’re buying portal stones from the AH you’re a moron

What's that chest piece with 3% chance to heal called?
---
There is /targetlasttarget for that exact thing.
---
I agree with this, but I'd the guild brings all the tanks and healers it might be fine, I guess. It's a lot easier to fill up a pug with dps and honestly I'd see reservations as a small price to pay for what is likely a reliable core to the raid.
---
Ah the good days, so sad they removed all his videos.
---
If you read the other thread, it says that hes co-GM with 3 other people who are all in the clique. He just did ot this way to kill their plans before they can screw over more people
---
LFM DPS, all greens and blues reserved
---
No, he could have removed them, then they have would have had no recourse.
---
Could have banned discord users, etc.
---
I'd say do the fording quest line once you hit 57+. Lots of good item choices from the final quest in that chain. Hes on the west coast of eastern plaguelands.
---
So glad I bailed my guild off when the new realms launched, most of the cesspit community seems to have locked into Arugal

Lol "Stop having fun your way!"
---
It’s a Jed/Rend run, that can be done with 5-6 people. You need one healer, and preferably one mage/Druid to decurse. The rest of the group can be warriors/rogues/hunters there for plenty of gear.
---
It’s a tough group to form, but works perfectly fine. This is how I got my Reed as a healer, though it was just me and one caster rolling on it. And we decided to do a victory lap if one reed dropped so the other had a chance at a res run.
---
Honestly I feel like WoW is designed to benefit being a team player, in multiple senses. I'm sure ninjas and assholes get away sometimes. Maybe if it's a rare bad mood it won't ruin them, but perpetual assholes and bad behavior tend to attract the same and push away the better people.
---
nek is stronk
---
That's literally what loot reservation is.
---
TLDR: no, you're just rested.
---
This place is awesome, took like 27 screenshots in there :D
---
Well tbh I definitely wasn’t rude, I’m a pretty polite and soft spoken person. I get that it’s BIS but I’m this circumstance I would say it is still unjust.
---
Mines really close to this if y'all want my code. I have things packed a little more together though.
---
They aren't wrong

Haha!  The "No!  You shut up!" might win the day!!
---
DW, or rather forced DW was the downfall of the shaman.
---
Shaman was always a 2H class when it came to enhancement, DW completely ruined the class fantasy.
---
Still is upkeep. Is the horde at low medium or high upkeep? Guess it depends on server.
---
Chris takes alot of things out of context and tried to defame Athene in a unprofessional manner.
---
You’re acting like private servers were not buggy and billions of dollars can actually help develop bug-free games. Surprise: more money will never, ever create bug-free perfect software.
---
You can have enough mana to constantly consecrate if you try get a fast weapon and judge+seal wisdom or judge wisdom/ seal righteousness with a flurry axe (seal of righteous counts as a second attack for weapon chance on hits, so you get 2 chances at a double hit per attack
---
All off of angerforge?
---
I'm not surprised at all. Athene and his group started posting videos out of character for Net Neutrality. Shortly after that he started his Ipower movement. I never looked into it much, but it definitely gave off a cult-in-infancy vibe.
---
You are basically asking people to work for your guild while not being a member.
---
The fuck is with you kids and reserving shit these days? Hopefully nobody joins.  I'd encourage anyone to not join loot reserved groups. Maybe it will help get rid of these entitled kids.
---
Very stark contrast: this reserve shit in pugs hardly happened in vanilla.
---
Timbermaw reputation grind. Much harder to do at 60.
---
I run something similar. Works just fine for healing but the dps is pretty terrible. You could dps a scholo or strat with some gear but wouldn’t advise the other 5 mans or raids.
---
Yes I’m considering it, a bit of a hard choice since I have BFA on the account that I have horde toons on. I don’t play bfa much, but I’d like not to have 2 concurrent subs going just because I wanted to give it a second chance.
---
Also, which gender in human race do you reckon would be a good choice. And is grinding  darnassus rep hard?
---
Trying to minise the grind a bit. Since I’ve already Grinded a lot on the horde side.
---
has to be on a cult
---
&gt; I beat a 57 warrior in a duel with my 29 Twink hunter back in classic.
---
I distinctly remember killing level 60s in Hillsbrad foothills with just myself and a friend. We were both in our 30s at the time, with the proper coordination you could kite just about any melee to death. 
---
A group of 4-5 level 30s could kill a PvP geared 60 if done correctly. 
---
If the player was just an incompetent PvE content person, (which is the vast majority of gankers/campers), it was quite easy.
---
I would agree the lack of spell resist here does seem a little suspicious, but it's a welcome change IMO. This quick thinking hunter deserves to get away from the mouth-breathing level 60 player.
---
And that logout was smooth as butter.

Not sure what you're looking for, but check out gathermate

Was the bug this tragedy of the screenshot dimensions?
---
are you legit telling someone to use the Reddit search function? You must be trolling as hard as Athene did :D
---
That’s literally the shittiest legendary.  Don’t stress it.
---
Yeah that mage sucked tbh. I will beat rogues every time if I have my CDs as a mage..
---
I was struggling with my hunter class quest until I read a comment from 2006 that told me the easiest way to do it
---
Slim models used to be able to get under karazhan as well. It's a big smiley under there
---
Wow, you must have very low self esteem to make a reddit post about this.
---
I mean... any decent healer could heal BWL with blue items from 1.12 classic wow. Many of them are better than set items from MC, Or nearly as good. And there are lots of great blue rings/trinkets/neck pieces that are nearly as good or better than the MC/ony stuff.
---
I do :[
---
I think there is some potential in the end part withing pulling the 2nd dragon ontop of the Shade, killing it, then waiting for all the dragons to get to the clump in the middle for an big AOE, too busy preparing for raid night tonight tho to get it done, will be next week before i can get a serious try in.
---
This is substantially worse than reserving imo.
---
Yeah I'm sure you're gonna unsubscribe from a thousands other china-associated services
---
Don't give me that "thousand mile" bs
---
oh i read it ;)
---
Cant you tell sarcasm when you see it? lol
---
/respect
---
Athene playing classic?
---
You better WERK WERK!
---
&gt;even undead rogues can be honorable
---
99% of time they aren't, though.
---
I think the only gear checks we really ever did was heroic Ymir and heroic Alagon, the rest was just "don't fuck up"
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with reserving one item from a run you have put together.
---
For example if somebody puts together a jed/rend run and puts reed on reserve - I might join as a tank that would like Gyths skull of fire res.
---
Stop whining about it and form your own group.
---
You lose a ton of AoE by going fury.
---
Xn from apes has done 750 of these and still doesn't have it. Also possible on mage. Here's a vid of the mage strat:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXChmWStpc
---
That mage sucked. I've won every fight against a rogue so far as a mage.
---
&gt;Includes a haste buff which is just insane
---
A 10% haste buff that you can keep on 3 people at the very most isn't going to be nearly as OP as the TBC Bloodlust you're likely thinking of. 10% haste will take 0.25 seconds off of a 2.5 sec cast spell, or 0.30 attack speed off of a 3.00 attack speed weapon.
---
&gt;when I read it I was like oh, so you are trying to build a tank Enhancement tree like it was originally envisioned, except some of the talents completely go against this, Savage Weaponry, what?
---
&gt;but usually talents augment only one thing
---
It's almost like I'm trying to make unique options for both tanking and DPS builds. And it's not like Vanilla or TBC talents stray away from having two effects on one talent; the Feral tree is chock full of them and benefits as a result.
---
&gt;You changed Toughness to be the equivalent of two warrior prot talents, so that is clearly to strong.
---
Maybe the reason for that is because Enhancement tanking is very weak compared to a Prot Warrior? Nobody picks Toughness because Shamans get so much less out of each point due to their Mail armor compared to a plate-equipped Warrior or Paladin.
---
&gt;I think Armaments of the Storm is unbalanced as well. It is insanely strong.
---
The talent I replaced with Armaments only increased the Shaman's weapon damage by 10%. Armaments does 20% weapon damage, but only about half the time, so it does the same thing as Weapon Mastery but with a bit more flavor to it. If an average of 10% weapon damage is really overpowered, clearly it didn't help specs like Enhancement or Prot Paladin.
---
&gt;so the Shaman has to juggle two different buffs with 5min and 10min durations? This is a wacky talent that is too powerful for a tier one.
---
Ideally the weapon enhancements would be given a 10 min duration as well as a baseline effect. And there are tons of powerful tier one effects; Aimed Shot is one of the Hunter's most powerful and important abilities, Mind Flay is a fantastic Shadow ability, and you won't see a single Prot Paladin or even Ret Paladin worth their salt without having Consecration included in their toolkit. Still, the Elemental Shields aren't ludicrously powerful or anything; they have relatively lesser effects compared to the weapon enhancements, and 2hander specs wont gain anything from the talent (there's a reason why I have an additional ability in Row 5 to compensate)
---
&gt;I do like the base idea of Ancestral knowledge, but considering that most Enhancement Shamans arent using gear with Int the amount is rather minute. It would be interesting if Ancestral Knowledge was a deeper talent or lead to a deeper talent to help mana issues but wasnt something that others would use, cause in this tree Resto and Elemental get a huge amount of mileage out of that talent. 
---
I mean, yeah. The reason I made quite a few of the earlier talents the way I did was to give a reason for the other specs to dip into Enhancement to, well, enhance their spec or delve into having more of a supportive role with their totems or Bloodlust rather than simply going deep into Resto by default. In retrospect, I certainly should have changed a few talents (Flametongue Weapon and Totem could increase spell damage by a small amount while Frostbrand gives a large spell damage debuff when it procs to encourage an Elemental/Enhancement hybrid build more, and Flurry's effect probably should've been a seperate talent) but there was only so much room I had on the graphic at the time.
---
I remember in wrath I was in Grizzly Hills and saw a horde Druid SPRINTING toward a cave and then about a minute later saw three alliance coming up the hill. They asked me where he went and I said south toward howling fjord and they ran that way. I went into the cave and found him hiding in the back and I tried to the best of my abilities to relay that they were gone. He reluctantly followed me and I escorted him to the Dragonblight border and we parted ways. A few hours later I got mail from a name I didn’t recognize and he said it was him on an Alliance toon. We played together on horde and alliance together for much of the rest of the expansion. 
---
Tunar, this is Belathear, proud Paladin of the Alliance and I’d be proud to escort you and protect you again anytime.
---
I remember that level range, i was like "why the fuck do i have so many heads in my bags" :D
---
Hot cider and amusement in the am.
---
Easily my favorite quest line in all of WoW. Purely cause of the challenge. The one you have to kite in winterspring with only serpent sting was great
---
Well I’m on judgement of light for our raids so I don’t have imp ret aura and have them in holy for seal of light judgement. Honestly the dps is so pants I’m thinking just going into prot for the utility instead, Kings etc.
---
I don't know the specifics, but the gist of it is if an opposing faction raids a town, like horde raiding southshore, a guard will spawn for every member of the opposing faction in the battle, repeatedly, if a civilian is attacked.  Flightmasters respawn in 5 minutes instead of taking MUCH longer.  It's basically completely useless to attack a town because guards will spawn pretty much infinitely.
---
Because it's amazing for threat generation.
---
I am currently at 7% hit due to having Onyxia's neck, you're right that you would be closer to hit cap with Impervious Giant, but considering trash mobs are not always level 63+ there is no reason to be at 9% when clearing trash.  Weapon is however irrelevant when fighting bosses, as you should be stacking MCP for the on use haste effect. I'm still at 7% with MCP since I'm not using Imprevious Giant, rather Fist of Omokk.
---
As I am only 2% under hit cap it's not a huge hit, but you said it yourself that there is not enough hit items to go around currently (been hoping for Band of Accuria but won't drop for us), this will however change with DM releasing within a couple days.
---
I agree fully though that once you're at 9% hit there will be room for improvement, which will be seen hopefully in my next Molten Core run on Sunday the 20th.  
---
Reasoning for Rip was to test out how high it was on the debuff priority list, next week I'll be running the ferocious bite spec rather than thick hide, so that should be a 5% damage increase as well.
---
And we dont want you either:)
---
Despite the fact that I love addons like this, because it allows me to track players I want to kill and why.. it does feel a bit unfair sometimes, being able to tell when someone rezzes and when someone goes stealth seems broken on occasion
---
No lol only if they also have numbers on their side. Low level or not. Horde players are afraid of one on one's.
---
Alliance in a nutshell...
---
\*crawls in a trench\*
---
It's nothing you can't already see in the combat log
---
Do you have data to back that up? Mages seem like they would scale much better as fire spec
---
Yeah, the last instance in the entirety of classic makes my build less viable. Therefore it's worthless /s
---
Why is it harder I'm just about friendly at level 52, and maybe only 100 feathers stocked up, but what makes it harder at 60 other than you're skipping doing it while you get exp?
---
What’s it been?  14.... 15 years?
---
I reserve valuable items in dungeons because I can save the group time by being a good tank with really good gear :)
---
Name checks out
---
And more power to you!
---
It's all about supply and demand
---
Thanks dude :D
---
Try get a group for scholo and get mirah's song, pre bis OH.
---
I guess. But like how much could you even sell it for? It's not even worth the hours you put into it at that point at minimum wage?
---
About yourself maybe. You can't even keep consistent logic in your attacks. First level doesn't matter and me killing people higher than me is still bad, then you flip to accusing me of lying altogether. You are a giant walking contradiction.
---
I still feel a large part of doing so was to even the raiding and pvp scene a bit. As I was talking to a few friends about recently. In classic. Alliance is by far the superior raid faction thanks to location, paladin buffs, and fear ward. But horde was much more oriented towards pvp with the various racial abilities. While many hate how much retail levels the playing field to much. In a way. Classic needed that to become a better game. It was too off balance.
---
There’s a bigger issue of tanks losing aggro, than dieing because of lack of survivability. Healers should not have a problem keeping the tank alive, but the tank should worry about their threat.
---

Only Angerforge currently drops it.
---
Wow, you just lie to yourself all the time like that or only when you're playing video games?
---
Lol you salty kids who moan about this are 100% too lazy to make your own groups. Otherwise you would understand why people reserve items in the first place.
---
Here’s a radical thought: don’t join if you don’t like them reserving loot.
---
Awe. Sadly im on us west benediction. I shall carry on the legacy of swosh on my server.
---
Honestly that stuff shouldn't really matter because how do you compare the way people help the guild. If person A ran 10 people through Mara for the Blackstone ring, Person B ran 10 people through brd/ubrs for their ony attunement and player C donated a flask recipe the guild bank all 3 players are helping the guild so how do you decide who gets the item?
---
Thanks for the advice everyone!
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExubxotZVbhzb
---
Try this.  Use the last 5 points to get whatever your raid needs of you.
---
You don't need to be out of combat to loot it. And levelers aren't a concern there since it's mostly 60s, though they're still usually combat for PVE reasons.
---
I don't see why it proves people are lying. I don't mind twink only eventually if that's what the people want. That's why I twinked in the first place. For now im about keeping classic as classic as possible, however. Twinking died down because twink only bgs caused queues to stretch 30-45 minutes. I think twinking will be more popular this time around so even if they segregate us, queues won't be as bad.
---
I just think it's kinda bad logic though. They don't separate best in slot 60s from freshies. Y'all just need to optimize your character if you wanna succeed in pvp it's not a tough concept
---
But now much would you need to eat to even start to feel anything? Almost certainly more than you could possibly eat without puking

I just became class lead (warlock) for my guild. What should I keep in mind?

Well I reset my talents and unlearned Insect Swarm.  It did not make a comeback.
---
I hadn't learned any ranks beyond 1, though.  Maybe that's it?

This game is 10x better if you just play the game for fun, rather than make sure you have to do something as few times as possible.
---
Took me 76 runs to get mine. Always ran with guildies that just helped me farm it. Made tons of gold at least

Yeah I didn't play on my own account until after BC so I didn't really get it, but it's a hugely impactful thing having the faction locked classes
---
What's a good server for alliance? Looking to play alliance for the first time ever
---
Curse assignment, imp bots.
---
Maybe this is just me, but if someone is up front about what they are reserving, they should be able to reserve anything they want. If they advertise a pug MC run and reserve literally everything, at least people will have the information and won't bother joining up. I honestly see no problem with this. Any smart guild will only reserve the bare minimum they need to or else they'll never get their run done.
---
I leveled ret and just asked the healer to take gear they didnt need and if they said they needed id just pass and I got geared enough for MC by 60 but I started looking when i hit mara dungeon.
---
Never ceases to amaze me people care this much about a game... yet along a old ass game.  Perception is king and they are all fools.

You can’t open a chest in combat, unless something is very wrong with my game? Have never been able to open a chest in combat as a rogue.

Regarding the character deletions... I guess you're not on a high pop server, so you can't transfer them off for free? That's rough.

Night elf rogue is a great choice; I love the aesthetic. But otherwise you may want to pick human rogue for the +10% reputation bonuses which will help towards your mount :)

Having a hard time past 40 with enhance could be the gear but all I feel like I’m doing is waiting for WF to go off, maybe elemental will feel better and I can get off my mage  and rogue alts

For rouge and hunter id say its hella worth it, the pants you get from killing the last boss as a quest reward are insane. I plan to use mine untill devilsaur most likely. However yes unfortunately it is miserable to find a group (took me over 2h in lfg on mankrik at semi peak hours)

Currently level 47, and I’m using a leveling build that emphasizes single target dps, if you were wondering.  I’m not AoE grinding to 60, I a was, I’d use a different build.   Most of the other mages I’ve run with have an AoE build cast blizzard, get aggro, die, and we wipe.

Most mobs can be kited indefinitely so long as you keep generating threat on them. Faerie fire is good because it doesn't do any damage and you can spam it as much as you want.

There are essentially 3 options. By picking up shield spec you enable one of them without significantly impacting the others (ancestral knowledge is bad). 
---
1h+shield: With WF or flametongue
---
2h: If slow you go rockbiter, can go WF if its fast (2.5s or faster)
---
Ele: Caster
---
Ultimately weapon enhancements are very close in damage though, so dont worry too much about it. 
---
Ele is the best starting somewhere around 40/44
---
Ok that was super funny lol
---
Based on this and some of the comments, I feel like this could make for a great Drama Time video
---
Am I the only person who loves Gnomer? It's not that hard.
---
Can confirm, saw it on my bank char this morning
---
what you said makes no fucking sense
---
When guilds filled empty spots in vanilla with pugs it was to sell items no guildies needed tho, so reserving only crafting mats and bindings actually seems like a good deal compared to that
---
On Razorgore, you can't farm shit 24/7. It is impossible NOT to find at least 2 more players, even at impossible hours, like 5 a.m on a Tuesday.
---
During the day, pray to gods that a vein or herb spawns in front of you.
---
And weekends? Just forget about, you are better off fishing, you'll make more gold.
---
3/4th of the EU realms are still layered, which means at least 2x5,000 concurrent in normal hours, and 3x5,000 concurrent on peak hours / weekends.
---
Even a conservative figure puts Classic player base at over 5 million players...today.
---
If Classic can be labeled "dead", with a player base that is bigger than BfA, FFXIV and ESO, combined...well...I guess it's dead.
---
That's actually really funny yo lol
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
That's the point, a healer doesn't need anything from those bosses. Why would they come?
---
I really like those unit frames, what’s are they?
---
It's a crappy situation but I get the hunters perspective on this.  He joined the pug to make his future runs smother and there is no guarantee he ever runs with you again.  The 10 agi he gets will last a very long time.
---
That said when his bow drops normal conventions hays you pass if there are any hunters in the group...this group doing pure ms need, you get to roll as there is no promise that stat stick will work for you.
---
Hear me out for a sec.
---
I play all open world RPG's on xbox one with no mods.

Literally watch any guide videos for naxx/AQ.

Most of the time, warlocks are ahead of mages.
---
So the NFL have allowed their players to make political gestures during games and how many have used it as an opportunity to throw up nazi salutes or burn crosses? Zero. People are still moderated by how the public will react to any statement they want to make.
---
In that case I’d shift two points out of deflection, allowing you to max both BoM and BoW.
---
What's attunement? People keeping throwing it around and I have no idea what it means
---
Wait...you said warlocks are top dog, but warrior is king. Which is it?
---
I find the racials are balanced in classic due to the fact that 79% of people haven’t hotkeyd their racial ability. Do you have any idea how many undead I’ve ran into that don’t have will of the forsaken bound, it gives me a good laugh
---
Thanks buddy, I corrected my spelling. ;)
---
A dagger with fire weapon, melts early game. Cast flame shock, Ls then melee for a few seconds.
---
False. You can tell the sec and race of a skull, they don't all look the same.
---
Don't forget the Moon.
---
I was questing in Duskwood and a 60 horde rogue was *STREAMING*  camping lowbies questing and was acting so pretentious in his stream it numbed my mind.
---
I can't imagine anything more pathetic, honestly. Ganking is one thing. Streaming and acting like it's real PVP is entirely another.
---
how did you suicide yourself?
---
It only ever seems to be horde players who give a shit. They were always a bunch of edgy cunts, tbh.
---
Well I am on a high population server. But there’s never a que. so transferring is not an option.  Female or male Nelf?
---
Also, surely the 10% bonus helps with argent dawn rep, however as a human I also have to farm darnassus rep, right? So the time saved with racial bonus gets offset due to split focus on rep grinding for 2 factions
---
Are you making money from tailoring?
---
I have the extreme Q and a Solo 2. The Q is ridiculous and the solo 2 is amazing with the water piece attachment.
---
11/10
---
No, it's just intelligent and maximizes your time/efficiency. It's so, so easy to not join a group that's doing that if you don't want to deal with it.
---
Looks like zperl
---
Weapon skill doesnt affect pvp tho
---
thanks ! It's Kui and Zperl
---
No, you waited until their day off and went and did it that day. Anyway I've only heard of this and never actually participated in it or had it done to me.
---
That’s the plan.
---
And in 10 runs you'll see 10 decorated chests!
---
On a more serious note, I've done about 45 runs on my rogue and not even seen it drop, if you think im gonna invite 2 level 53 rogues and let them roll or win it over myself. You are wrong. Reserving items is fine.
---
A week ago me and my other level 45 friend corpse camped a level 60ish alliance that tried to interfere with our questing. Was kinda funny.
---
You are horrible at the game.
---
Losing sanity, forgot if that was confirmed. I’m nearing 70 angerforges without seeing it once. Desperate for another chance lol
---
The power difference between a non twink and a twink of their same level is more than the power difference between a fresh 60 and a 60 in full MC gear. Even when you consider later raiding gear the hp values of classes barely goes up. Meanwhile twinks will have way more HP than anyone that isn't twinking.
---
At 60 it's intended for you to gear up your character because you're not leveling anymore so they don't get outdone by higher level gear. At 19 you're relying mostly on items that just cannot be considered reasonable for a leveling 19 to get and enchants that easily cost more than their mount would at 40. 
---
Twink queues became long because people didn't want to twink if they weren't allowed to run around drooling as they 1 shot new players. They even went so far as to make a new account without any expansions so they could be level capped at a lower level and avoid the twink queue.
---
And you can hang out at the boat or cliffs and throw people off :)
---
This just in: Turns out there are no fair fights in WoW
---
Literally won it in my very first UBRS run :(
---
Worth it for the quests for xp and some good gear. It's actually not that bad. You have a quest just outside instance for mini boss and the white punch card. The artifact quest might take 2 runs, grime encrusted ring is good xp, escort is really easy. The only hard part is the dwarves at the end (33-34elites with high damage and spell reflect robots) it requires good CC and tanking.
---
Get started on your Thorium Brotherhood/Argent Dawn/Timbermaw reps as mentioned below, a rep drop off will occur once you hit 60. 
---

LFM caster dps/heals Briarwood Reed res
---
is something I've seen lately.
---
100% this.
---
Not at all. Primarily for the chest BoP. I'm making mooncloth though so can either sell the product or make the epic robe, tbc.
---
Skinning is good and provides solid money.
---
I have not had issues with money since I started the game really, and I am not exactly trying to make gold nor have I had any valuable drops.
---
Depends how quick you want your epic mount, in my eyes it's not really that important...
---
moveanything works fine o.o (but with my bunch of ui addons it shows alot of error, but they doesnt matter so i just ignored them)
---
Juicy
---
Me, being the main tank, I made tanks last roll as long as we could down the boss. it was Heals &gt; DPS &gt; Tank, since higher DPS would put less stress on the other two. faster fights ment less healing and tanking.
---
wasn't the last suicide pact post an alliance group in Ironforge? lol
---
And they can’t understand why after 2 hours they still can’t I’ll put the group
---
That’s an excellent question.
---
Fappinfather is a very creative name
---
What’s going on here, what did you cast?
---
Thanks, now we dont have to ignore you ourselves.
---
It really is. I still enjoy playing retail once a year or so, but jesus is the story a mess. 
---
Don't even get me started on the timeline your character goes through if they're new. Doubly so for allied races who are 'new' members of the Horde/Alliance but then go through all the old expansion's content. New players would be so confused.
---
Oh, now that's just fiendish! Love it.
---
How's disbanding any different? Still not gonna get the mats
---
idk about usefulness, i would like boomkins in my group in dungeon or grinding. Cause they are cute. Praise boomkins
---
Spamming dungeons is so boring though
---
For those pants, yes. For your sanity, no.
---
Boiling something is usually to denature the proteins that make up harmful bacterium and viruses. Arsenic is a base element so you can boil it as much as you like and it'll still be poisonous.
---
Somebody pointed out the arsenic is inside so I guess boiling might be good for loosening the broccoli's tissue and binding the arsenic to the water to extract it but idk.
---
It's a raid and then some gathering for the buff, probably
---
The gm of that guild is an absolute cancer in world chat
---
Solid argument.
---
Warrior tank: 
---
The Pariah's instructions in maraudon gives a bis trinket

the hinterlands elite quests give a very good trinket
---
You can always call me in. I can swoop all of you  in one go!
---
What does me saying activate windows have to do with Linux? Yes, he should just install Linux.
---
I think it's reasonable to assume dkp is gonna be for casuals. My guild uses a loot list/LC system(LC only for a few items). Dkp eats up a lot of time in raids.
---
I see your point about benching the rogue who's hoarding his dkp for weapons. But you remove him and bring in a rogue who can essentially win nothing because he doesn't have any dkp. Dkp is not new player friendly generally. You guys may have work arounds. But it's just a mess of a system (TO ME). Like you said you have people who aren't farming pre bis and waiting for raid gear. Are the equally getting dkp as people who got prebis? That would absolutely rub me the wrong way if I farmed pre bis only to find out it didn't matter I could just show up and get raid loot.
---
It's not about taking a whole night it's about taking long enough to where you can't do another raid. My guild clears MC in an hour. We will only get faster too as we gear. You guys will cap out sooner rather than later.
---
Eventually you hit a wall in getting the raids done faster. It's why things like fury/defiance tanking are the meta for more hardcore guilds and loot council is more prevalent in those guilds. Dkp just doesn't allow these things to happen easily or quickly.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick or anything man. I'm just trying to explain the game as I see it. I've played 2 servers through naxx and 1 through aq40. I've seen this happen time and time again. If dkp works for you that's great, but there are limitations and lots of problems that will come up as the server progresses.
---
If you're not honored,  10 portal runes are 2g. he's not lying. Most people are honored and it runs 1g 80s for ten.
---
It's safe zone tho...
---
I have no problems with that, personally - although I at least somewhat understand people being mad about that. One is finding a different, but equally (or more so) difficult way of solving the puzzle that is PvE content. The other is finding a way around anti-griefing safeguards that Blizzard implemented. While I, again, do not agree with those safeguards in the first place - I do see how the situations are quite different.
---
I'm a resto shaman, I cant fight anybody my own level.
---

Good joke bud

confirming, half to 2/3 of the "raiders" in my guild still aren't 60 yet so we're filling out another guild's "pug" mc/ony for the time being

"I soloed it on hunter/wlock, ez."
---
Does this help?
---
On my first run ever on my hunter i hated this dungeon more than anything, but i think that had to do more with my scuffed team. On my rouge with a little more knowledge (im a new player) as well as a WAY better team i not only didnt hate it i rather enjoyed it and we ran it about 8 times for the tank ti loot a blue shield.

Custom EPGP mixed with loot council &gt; good loot council &gt; EPGP &gt;  DKP/ Soft reserve+1 &gt; Roll
---
If I ever get a hunter to end game, I'm definitely rocking lokdelar
---
A healer doesn't need anything so why does reserving HoJ while looking for one matter?
---
If you have a bunch of locks make sure they aren’t throwing 1.2 million dots on bosses (other than Onyxia who requires moar dots)
---
I like SK as it’s more fairer and extremely lightweight. 
---
And easy to merge multiple runs to one master list.
---
Play night elf rogue, get cats without huge hassle. Nothing wrong with a night elf rogue.
---
Maybe because of the serious crimes they commited.  It is mentioned they kill undead and living alike.
---
Or spend 30 minutes doing 3 well placed corpse runs instead of 12 hrs of grinding. 
---
Once you have fp, screw those care bears.
---
My husband and I are leveling 3 tank/healer pairs; warrior/priest, pally/pally and druid/druid.  The two druids are by far my favorite.  We structured our talents so we both had 2/2 Feline Swiftness (by level 21, respec at 30).  So getting Cat Form was life changing.  As the healer, I feel much less useless while questing because I can go kitty and actually do some damage.  
---
There is just so much utility with the two druids, also we’re getting to do some stealth runs, which is so nice.
---
Thanks for the post. And thanks for the youtube video. I am not 280 LW yet so when i get there the video will be easy to find.
---
Did you forget to switch accounts ? 🤔🤔
---
So you're a guild with raid-ready alts that considers a guild that can't complete a raid in one night worthy of rivalry?
---
You create the meme, you make the design. If you don't like it, you ignore it.
---
In general spell damage. Int and Stam are more for pvp or aoe grinding.
---
What server?
---
noticed some names
---
I'm a Warlock so i will save something since the 1st mount it's free, still need something like 400-450 golds for the Dreadsteed, still don't need it asap.
---
I'd rather rested XP thanks.
---
US
---
Stone scale eels stacks are about 3g on my server. This seems low. Any thoughts as to why it is so low at the moment? Are there bots fishing them and driving the price down?
---
Not normal.
---
&gt; So you're saying that having shady admins accepting money for un-bans,  spawning rank14 characters and giving the gold sellers gold to sell, is a  better experience? 
---
Not my fault if you picked a shady server, the server I played on didnt have any of this bullshit. And at least there were GM that responded fast unlike classic where I had to wait 5 day for a GM response.
---
&gt; Having the server crash 5 times a day and rollback leading to lost loot is a better experience
---
Idk what server you were playing on, but I dont know any big server that had a rollback of more than a minute when a crash happened. On the one I played on I only saw crash happen in the first week after the launch, and unlike classic I could log back as soon as it was back on without having to wait again in a multiple hour queue.
---
&gt; Having quests randomly bug out and break is a better experience? 
---
Well I had a few random quests not working on the server I played on true, but it was the same thing in classic (well actually classic was worse since the quest that wasnt working for me was Onyxia questline, not a random quest)
---
" Classic having a few bugs " It's not a few bugs, some classes aren't even working properly (mainly hunter and druid) and alot of thing are broken.
---
Nah dude. Money = programming! If there’s a big, just reverse feed money into a printer. That’s why AAA companies shouldn’t ever experience bugs!
---
I’d silence your ass for bringing that real world pita bs into the game too.
---
Skin herb and mine all have uses, depending on what dm farm you mean.
---
Yeah, wouldnt mind yours either!
---
In reality, yes. Tanks are incredibly in demand right now, I log on and get whispers from people I've played with constantly.
---
Sorry but i'm actually a software developper :)
---
Means you do the corresponding quests to get in there.
---
MC has one deep inside BRD to get some pieces of some shit and the guy will teleport you into MC afterwards. Horde has a whole ridiculous quest chain to get into onyxia's lair though.
---
I play hearthstone while on FP to kill the time.
---
Irony is pretty funny
---
What server is this? :)
---
I did this to a hunter on gorefiend back in the day. I'll never forgot that guy, JohnPaulJones. sorry friend, thought I was helping.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=1725/distract](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=1725/distract)
---
Ultimately I would level it engineering whenever you want, if you think it could be fun while levelling then go for it.
---
Personally I would just wait until 50+ and then you can farm gold and spam level it.
---
Be considerate to goblin / gnomish and decide whether you want all the BOP engineering items which means levelling engineering twice.
---
If you plan on PVPing just have engineering ready got phase 3 if you want to blow people up.
---
I've always liked the theory (?) that boats, zeppelins, and banks were "free" because auction house cuts subsidized them.
---
Mage snagged the +40 healing pants from BRD from me, fortunately not that rare, but was still salty for the rest of the run.
---
Fuck yes.
---
Guessing, but I imagine 24 str is roughly equal to 1% crit and 1% hit combined. Maybe you can look online for theorycraft. Should be something like 1% hit = 15 str or something like that.
---
No, you are telling people they are allowed to come with you
---
Go for the crit, no contest, it's by far your best stat as a hunter.
---
screenshot/10
---
What warrior?
---
This is stupid as fuck. Literally 1 item/class being distributed differently is the the line you're drawing between "favoritism" and an exact split.
---
It's MC. Not all drops are created equal. Some items are BiS for multiple tiers, others are worse than pre-raid blues and are used in PVP only.
---
Just because it's purple doesn't mean it was a huge upgrade for the player and they should get passed over for 6 more pieces until it's their "turn" again.
---
i currently have t1 gloves and helm but ideally i would like t1 bracers, gloves, and boots for the set bonus.  
---
also, i think t1 is better than crimson felt hood. it has significantly more int so bit of an increase in crit and mana and hit is always useful as there is so little on gear.
---
We think they got it , but I’m sure they don’t.
---
Can confirm, 2 Druids is fantastic for everything PvE and all pvp memery.
---
Plus, if you do get into a raiding guild, it’s likely just the two of you, give or take 1-2 more Druids to split gear with.
---
Maybe its a joke?
---
Tbh /ROLL is the best loot system (with obvious restrictions so that warriors don't roll on hunter bows etc). Yes, people joining later for farm bosses have it easy, but the progress raiders had a chance at the loot first. Having loot earlier is better than later.
---
/roll is the only good loot system
---
I play on faerlina and get 17ms I’m from southern Ontario.
---
Look up Tirion fordring quests in eastern plaguelands. Grind quests
---
Questguru!!
---
I like it!  Kitty is a big benefit to dps-ing as resto.
---
Are you Alliance on Herod?
---
Do you run back to the entrance after killing princess or is there a faster way to reset?
---
lmao, so you made a doxxing attempt, got banned for posting some random person's info, and you're admitting to it openly? Not only that, but bragging about it?
---
You don't think you would be banned for that no matter whose info it was? It totally only happened because your guess was right?
---
I'd probably stop offering this story up if I were you.
---
Why does this art as of 6:06pm est have only 1k score?
---
Took me 40 to get mine.
---
I started reserving after 30 because I was so weary.
---
Plata o plomo, bandito.
---
Some groups tell dps to purely wand dps ony in phase 1 while the tank builds threat. Then normal dps in phase 2+3
---
Lol the entitlement from you is absolutely disgusting, why should I farm crusader or pay 200g for the recipe for you to just come and get it for free? Skill it yourself or ask a friend if you don't wanna pay.
---
Because a player with nothing else to do will gank you lol.
---
That works with every metal song
---
I literally heard this 2 days ago, and I really hope it's sarcasm this time.
---
No one “desires” a paladin. 
---
Shammies, on the other hand.,.
---
Could you tell me/us the name of it please?
---
Absolutely not. If you're dungeon gearing before cap, you're doing it wrong. Run them once, maybe twice to clear quests, gear is a bonus. Otherwise your time is better spent grinding mobs. If an average dungeon takes an hour, you get far less xp than just hitting stuff solo as you travel.
---
Neutral timbermaw is super fast, def not 12 hours
---
i see all "res" grp as some dumbass looking for tools to help him get his little toy.
---
&gt; the server I played on didnt have any of this bullshit And at least there were GM that responded fast unlike classic
---
So you played on some dead server with less than 500 online, got it.
---
&gt; but I dont know any big server that had a rollback of more than a minute 
---
Rollbacks happening at all was fucking obnoxious. How can you defend this, rofl
---
&gt;some classes aren't even working properly
---
Oh, so having a few bugs is now equal to "the class isn't even working properly!!"
---
Go back to your private servers then, if it's so much better experience :)
---
For me, it has to be Shaman. Earth Shock is amazing, as are the fast casts if you go down Ele. Massive Windfury procs as Enh are cathartic. And Resto is probably the Classic healer that stands out the most mechanically (not necessarily the best though).
---
Yes.  Fuck reserves.  If you need to pug, YOU NEED THEM.
---
As noob advice, I’d say run it until it becomes not-fun for you. Personally I just do them once for the quests.   
---
(Ps you’ll want lvl 17/18 before headin  there)
---
If that's the case, it's a 1/1,000,000 chance to have three 100s rolled in a row. Might as well buy a lottery ticket at that point because damn
---
is this a reference to FNV?
---
I wonder how much I can sell Sally's bathwater for
---
got em
---
Pretty sure this comes with the auctionator add on it's built into it
---
I'm on 87 runs and haven't seen it. Honestly at this point you bet your ass I'm reserving it. I'm not gonna see it drop only to lose the roll.
---
People need to chill. Reserving items is fine. If you want the item just dont join that group. No harm done to anyone.
---
Absolutely, provided you have someone experienced running the show.  Worth it to run most dungeons once for the final quest reward.  5 People who don't know what they are doing is going to be a disaster, as the dungeon is quite confusing.
---
Much easier to get a group together for this as Alliance than Horde, it's the reverse of RFK
---
All four SM dungeons take 25-35 mins. Exp is great for 29-41...
---
Yeah i’ve been getting stunned by low levels, it’s pretty annoying.
---
What if you drew his interest on a graph, and that was the highest his interest ever went, as it plummeted down afterwards? It would have peaked.
---
(I know the proper word is piqued in his usage, just having fun.)
---
There's mobs that have a ranged sleep. It wouldn't work too well.
---
Should honestly have been kicked then and there
---
Basically why I leveled a caster shaman in wrath. Any mail Intel gear that dropped was mine haha.
---
Entitled much are ya?
---
I was wondering why there were so many people named Raul Alfonso Tejada when I went to visit Mexico. This explains so much.
---
There are so many bugs, it is frustrating because on many absolute silence on others they said they would work on them over a month ago, but hey Dire Maul comes out in two days. LUL
---
I now have you RAUL!!!!
---
Y'know, that sounds like a great way to hunt someone off of streaming. ;)
---
Got it set up and no errors so far. Thank you again for updating it for Classic; It just feels right.
---
If you do a custom emote the other faction just see an emote saying you are doing strange gestures.
---
week 1 or so, I was doing the silithid egg quest in southern barrens, standing on a node fighting several scorpids, a warlock came running over and stole my node.. so while stealthed I followed him around for the remainder of my quest and stole every node he tried to claim. hopefully he learned his lesson
---
I AINT YOUR FORTUNE SON
---
Horde crying about world pvp is hilarious when they outnumber Ally on every pvp server
---
I’m to casual in classic wow to care about reserving loot
---
I don't want to be mean but just use it? like you should know on the fly what heal you're throwing for how many hp.
---
Sure you are
---
Pretty much, tanks need nothing from live and I think very little or nothing from UD, so you need to incent them to run it somehow.
---
IT AINT MEEEEE!!!!
---
I like the idea! I had a similar idea but with 2x 1h swords!
---
So far none have dared. I suspect a gnome will get curious eventually though...
---
I would actually like to try retail but I'm not $20 interested in Retail.
---
Try leveling a warrior or shamy. The Herod axe will make a considerable difference for about 10 levels.
---
When i get ganked by someone who has a v significant advantage (high level difference over me - before i reached 60, initiating combat when i'm v low hp or fighting multiple mobs, with 2+ other players), i usually just assume it's some highschool kid who's mad at his mom for not buying the right brand of cookies.
---
You can log out in the dungeon and have a friend in group reset the dungeon for you. I believe you can also invite one of your alts to the group and reset yourself, but it still requires another person to put the group together.
---
Yeah that is a total waste. The analysis doesnt take into account what talents are being foregone
---
This is disgusting.
---
No it's not.  Tanks need nothing from live, and very little from UD (I think just one item).  If you want to incent tanks to join your group, you'll have to do something.
---
And it's better to know in advance.  Its not much different than just not inviting specific classes because of loot competition.
---
some server subs are bopping. some, like the one I'm on, is like 150 people. ask around in your server for a discord link if you want because the discord server for the server im on is pretty boppin.
---
At the very least, my trainer should be able to remember two specs that I usually play as and charge the normal fee to quickly swap between the two, avoiding dumb mistakes like a misplaced talent point that requires another 50g to correct. That doesn't really add much from any angle, it's just slightly clunky design.
---
That's basically what you have to do regardless I think.
---
You're not...  You're paying 5g essentially....  5g each party member.
---
Considering what the actual client is, I don't see this happening. While it was a crazy and interesting occurrence I dont see Blizzard letting it repeat.
---
Nah. I lost the Jed trinket versus other casters about 20 times now and did almost 50 UBRS runs. I'm not taking any casters in my group anymore.
---
And they went like 10 seconds without having their auto attack toggled...
---
No no no, when I respond to lfm I'm just letting them take me.
---
Did someone stand in the doorway? That's the only over variable I've seen. Hunters and Mages like to stand in the entrance hall and he is fleeing from your party, so it drives straight into a different one. All I know is that my farm group's done that clear over 50 times with no issues.
---
They couldn’t fill the run up with guildies because it was their second raid group and the usuals were saved to the first group.
---
According to Warcraftlogs on Blaumeux a week or two ago when I looked they were #3 on Horde for boss kills
---
3 pieces
---
My man! We have transcended!
---
50 UBRS runs in. Still haven't got it. If it drops I lose the roll. If I'm in a group with no need it doesn't drop. Fml.
---
I play on KromKrush, sometimes it gets a bit overwhelming with horde but it seems pretty balanced.
---
Whitemane for pvp. Somewhat horde bias though.
---
At first I thought the reason flasks and flask mats weren't selling too well was because there weren't many people running raids yet and it'd pick up as more people hit 60, but I'm starting to think it's just because people have "figured out" the game enough that they just aren't bothering with the expense of flasks cause they can clear the content easily enough without them.
---
100% gaming in the early morning (especially east coast) is amazing on basically any MMO. Hardly any competition.
---
Who cares?
---
Unfriendly is super fast.  Neutral takes a while.
---
Thanks for your reply, yes it was 2 different circles of friends. We all met while playing overwatch, I selected the side where I had more friends on. Sadly the ones on alliance stuck as they actually started liking the game. Others said it was too difficult and grindy and quit.
---
I’ll be doing some testing today. Thank you for input

For Holy Paladins, its 6 pieces.

So now a guild that clears BWL and AQ40 up to Huhu in one night is so hard up for raiders that an alt-spy account is able to get entry into the raid to “steal” the ID?
---
/ignore and voila
---
And the way to get the Ice Key from Banjo-Kazooie
---
Gorak, this video short was hilarious! Thanks for the great content. 
---
For those of us with no experience in this craft, can you give us an idea of what goes into the making of these videos?
---
From the beginning, I wish I did the victory lap rule. Find yourself another caster or healer that wants the Reed, and agree to do another run if the Reed drops. 
---
We were lucky to get 2 reed drops in 2 runs for the 2 of us that needed it. I won the first and stuck around so the other caster had a res run.
---
He clearly made the right choice.
---
I doubt it. The DPS side anyway. Shockadin is more a PvP thing. You might get asked to a different build for Raids though; Paladin Blessings are really nice, and you only have 1 that's improved from what I can see. If you wanted to do a Holy-DPSer, I've heard Smite Priest combos well with a Paladin just does that Judgement that increases Holy damage! :)
---
It's also pretty trivial to duo this earlier with a caster who can use the Acidic Walkers
---
Skeram
---
I think it's cooler to imagine a human that learns magic powers rather than elves because humans normally don't have magic powers, where as elves are only found in a fantasy setting and usually have magic powers. For example, playing a fantasy where the average Joe can now fly is more appealing to me than playing a bird creature that could fly.
---
*also armor looks the best on them
---
Yeah, they can get first orb. Is 20g not enough for you?
---
This dude wears greens into MC
---
Nice argument kid. Fury provides nothing for tanking dungeons outside of single target threat which while leveling is no issue at all. The issue is AoE threat. Sweeping Strikes is far far better AoE than anything fury can provide. 25% extra damage on WW is nothing compared to a Sweeping Strikes Whirwind. Also arms buffs 2H which is far better for threat while leveling than dual wielding and the WW hits harder. Also you get tactical mastery which allows you to swap stances for tanking. All of this is even more powerful in arms with a WF totem. 
---
Now endgame ST raid yes fury or fury prot is better but this entire discussion has been about leveling. 
---
You have no idea wtf you are talking about kid.
---
I'd say finding a tank with cape res is more optimistic than the mount.
---
Wonder what the dude thought when he came back...
---
Also has kill on sight functionality for ppl u want to add. Quite useful is it shows when rogues stealth also. The range on the addon is pretty big and it will always notify you earlier than you would have seen otherwise.
---
I was in stv last night on my 37 lock and a feral Druid I was running by just turned on me, no stealth just immediate scratching. 
---
I don’t initiate pvp but was ready, got my vw/sac done quick, fear and power dotted. As he was running back at me at 50%, I noticed he was ?? level. I chuckled that he was prolly mad but was prolly also about to tear my ass up but then a 60 lock swooped in and death coiled/nuked his ass.
---
It happened in vanilla and honestly felt as cringey then as it does now, but back then the meta was more about crafting your group in such a way just to exclude anyone who could roll against you.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhfg7d/its_reserved/
---
Yea I’m with you. If someone opens trade without asking, I just ignore it. Expecting me to deliver you items without even asking, or even worse demanding, is pretty rude. 
---
A simple “can I get some water” is all I’m looking for.
---
Like 60 horde 40 ally? Or worse?
---
I dont know why Hamish had the GM role. Possibly it was setup on a Gbank character that he and the 3 other leaders had access to? I just know Rithyn or however his name is spelt was the founder and leader of the guild initially as it was formed out of private server players from Northdale (Lightshope) months before classic came out.
---
Hamish was not the GM. He seems to just have been a hard working officer under the leadership of Rithyn and Pronkers. Apparently this guild has enough members to run 3 raids and Hamish was tanking and running raid 2 or something.
---
That's the whole point.
---
I agree, especially with a lot of the end game quests making you run all around Kalimdor. Once I hit 60 I’ll probably make it UC for easy access to the scourge and blackrock dungeons and when P3 hits it’ll prob go back to Xroads for AQ
---
With stomach acid.
---
I got my rogue to 60 then got bored with him and parked him in SS. I don't gank lowbies on my main but if I'm ganked I just put it on the tab. At the end of the day i'll hop on the rogue, head over to the hillsbrad farms where there's always horde, and stunlock to let the npc's kill as many horde as times I was ganked.
---
It's stupid but it's my thing now.
---
HJ is getting off light for saved gold in water
---
If it's a duel, the lock should win pretty much every time due to the Felhunter and cooldowns up. Can Devour Poly and slows so no worries about being CC'd while they kill your pet, than its just apply dots, death coil into fear. After they ice block use the Felhunter counterspell so you can hard cast fear without being countered yourself and you should win.
---
I actually see DPS reserving the orbs and looking for a tank and healer... LOL. How can they be so clueless.
---
Welcome to the rice fields, motherfucker.
---
I assume after a certain distance the path back to their spawn just can't be calculated and they get stuck.
---
I already stated why fury was better, you're just incompetent to be able to read it.
---
He’s gonna be like WTF I SWEAR I HUH???
---
lmfao that boss kills means nothing. u cant rank shit until pvp comes out
---
I'm not gonna lie. I tend to wait to do dungeons and I nearly over level them. Then find a group at least my level. It's easy to make wc hard when you take a level 16 hunter without his pet.
---
You can organise Strat live runs and reserve orbs.
---
Imagine not being totally devoted to a computer game and taking someone at their word who is.
---
Sell your tanking services, reserve items in exchange for tanking, dance on the mailbox for tips
---
I suspect as it was a 'shared' leadership they had GM on a guild bank character that they all had access to.
---
Full disclosure I played with all these people on the Northdale private server out of which this guild has been formed. So I know for a fact Hamish was not the overall GM. Rithyn the founder of the guild was the head of the guild.
---
It's pretty clear when you look at the loot distribution and attendance that the op is quite correct and goes out of their way to back up their claims.
---
No, ownership of a RaidID doesn't spread unless something dies inside the instance. You can zone in to their ID, but you won't be able to get into it on your own raid unless you have ownership. Never has been that way.
---
Dammit
---
This is truly disgusting coming from a horde player
---
&gt; best of luck getting hoj before it’s replaceable
---
Not sure if you meant this in jest, but HoJ doesn't become replaceable for Rogues or Warriors until Phase 5.
---
Don't care.  Only the GM can disband a guild.  Ergo, he could have kicked people instead of disbanding.
---
Ahahahahaha, holy fuck.  Good luck with that.
---
People just need to learn that it's part of the challenge to get gear. Other people exist: they want some of the same stuff you do, yet you need them to get it to drop in the first place.
---
The path the devs intended here is clear: run it, whether it's with people you know or not, until it drops and until you are allowed to lay claim to it. Until then... don't complain. It doesn't make the grind go by any faster, I promise.
---
Where ya questin on Tues?
---
I must ensure james scalds u for ur weak ass posts.
---
Ouch, that was your mount right there
---
Lol yea you said fury has better cleave damage lol. That talent is entirely worthless. It adds more dmg to the bonus damage of cleave not the actual dmg of cleave. It’s entirely worthless. Maybe 20-40 extra damage per cleave for 3 points lol. Unbridled Wrath for 2h? LOL
---
Everything you’ve stated is just flat wrong. Arms is better AoE dps and threat while leveling in dungeons in every way kid.
---
Chaotic neutral be like
---
Over on the right side of the page under the "join subreddit" button and next to your user name you should see a bit that says (edit) Click that.
---
Also, are you on Fairbanks?
---
Why do Restorative potions go for so much more on Tuesdays?
---
I'm so sick of this "both sides" argument! Which side is it that has knee-high mad scientists? Which has violent axe wielding dwarves? Which side is so cowardly they have an entire class dedicated to "bubble hearth"?
---
Think before you drop that both sides argument, as horde is so obviously superior, even a gnome could spot the difference.
---
I just felt like running!
---
Does any of this even really mean anything? Pretty ridiculous imo to even get mad about what other people think about themselves.
---
I think you mean 'people who join runs where 90% of the valuable items are reserved'  
---
    
---
If you can actually convince people to join those runs, you got big brains.
---
As a warlock, a lot of greens are my BiS even after getting my tier 1 epic set.

I just hit 60 and i went back to stv and had a good time with all the low lvl hordes. Just like they did to us. Going back later aswell. World pvp.
---
Orbs don’t always drop.
---
Huh, maybe...I'll tell everyone to scoot in next time and see how it goes.
---
Thanks so much man! :')
---
I recently made my very first [Alliance video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFQxZnxl6_Q), in case the Alliance players felt left out!
---
That's point 0.
---
It's a circular argument to say 'this is standard'. The question was always 'why is it standard'
---
Nah i think you arent reading, if you arent dagger spec you will be 6 piece t1 2 piece t2 onyxia pendant viskag brutality acuria quick strike blackhand hoj which is what I am minus the acuria cuz I havent seen it yet. [Phase 1]
---
What did you get?
---
Ahh that makes sense. I was afraid to jump off then have to swim all the way back.
---
Most people just don’t want to admit their /jokes are the funniest.
---
&gt;Especially a tank wanting Ironfoe
---
This is antithetical to the rest of your post. If you're trying to farm Hand of Justice, you're not running all the way to Emperor. 
---
Also, the low proccrate on Ironfoe for the current patch makes it not worth farming for.
---
If you submit a ticket a GM may be able to recover thw character.
---
Forget the mount! Ran UD 12 times in the last day and a half with not a single cape drop!!
---
It depends on build. I went 9 arms 31 fury and 11 prot.
---
Threat is hands down worse than deep prot, but my mitigation is as good as a deep prot warrior but with worse “oh shit” buttons. For 5 mans I would not recommend as in low rage scenarios with no raid buffs it’s a constant struggle to generate rage and hold agro (dropping mitigation gear for threat gear is a must). Giving up tact mastery would mean you could improve threat with defiance, at the cost of utility. Again I wouldn’t recommend for 5 mans.
---
But as the 3td tank in raids the advantage is that in fights I’m not tanking in raids I can do 90% of the dps of a full dps warrior, while having really good mitigation for off tanking in boss fights.
---
Wtf is it?
---
Our guild broke up back in 2005 for this very thing guild leader master looted it to me. The only warrior that tanked and dpsed back th3n. Top of the meter every raid. I didn’t have the dkp because I took loot that no one wanted and it was going to be a sharded otherwise.
---
The people that wanted it were a paladin and a hunter. Who were both class leaders. So much drama. New guild went all the way through naxx so perhaps we just got rid of some dead weight.
---
Oh dear
---
ah sry. mate
---
nope
---
I've seem people clip and stand, I've never seen a steady run (and I was afraid if I dropped the run I would fall off)
---
Sells for about 250g right now on my server since people are starting to hit 60 and it's pre-raid BiS
---
Well that is fair, But yeah had a shit ton of fun hahah :D
---
ooh i will!:D
---
I forgot the link ;_; edited it
---
Nah, that was just a bunch of people lying down. 
---
Then they started... killing themselves....
---
im playing on firemaw :)
---
I clipped it here because it lasted another 15 seconds to zone transition, then I fell off the other side and almost died to fatigue. Not super interesting lol.
---
MC resets. Lots of guilds do their MC runs on Tuesdays because that's when it resets.
---
Yeah but horde has undead rogues, the grimiest fucks of them all.(am horde btw).
---
You gotta win your battles where you can, man.

---
So if i, a decked out warrior tank with basically most of the best items currently available to me, reserve Ironfoe on Lava Runs. Is it considered «Douchebaggery?»
---
As soon as you pug anyone you give up the right to reserve stuff. At least in my opinion. Although I do understand it’s just a shittier way of saying you want only a certain kind of group. You wouldn’t get anything without the pugs, so why should you get more benefits just for inviting people? If you guild was that much of the group you would just 30 man this content.
---
Ah there it is, you can charge a pretty good amount for that, I'd start about 250 and negotiate, looks like you and your friend should be able to get your mounts with that
---
Nice argument. Glad you can agree that you’re wrong. Very mature for a kid your age.
---
This is something that I actually did find when googling.  They used to have separate cooldowns originally in vanilla, but this was nerfed in a later patch.  (Source: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Jumper_Cables_XL)
---
I guess it's to maybe avoid having something happen like a mage hitting need on an epic for a rogue because they are friends just in case the rogue would lose the roll, and then have it sent to his mate. 
---
That's not what happened here, the dude just saw purple for the first time and panicked, but I can see why they might be hesitant to sort disputes like that.
---
I am allowing them the privilege to  have the choice to think about how sweet it would be if I was in their group before i say to them "Nay, I shan't join your group"
---
Ah yes just simply kick the founder and his mates who have all been playing with the 100 people in the guild on private servers for years. I'm sure its real simple like that....
---
I play a hpal and let me tell you. Having 25% of your only form of cc/peel resisted, is barbaric. On top of that half of all players are mages, who can blanket silence, cast 2 frostbolts and cone. there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.
---
^Figured I'd give it a try.
---
Yeah, I've also been super mana hungry to not really feel that useful. The form is at least my excuse to buff the rest of the party while I'm oom lol
---
The loot on that sheet is not acurate, it hasn't been updated with t1 etc because it's all FREE ROLL. Believe me loot Is distributed fairly.
---
Yeah, but losing that roll even once is waaaaaaay more demoralizing.
---
I don't reserve loot, but I do invite things that won't roll against me first. If I don't get other bites I'm not that uptight...but I definitely try to fill groups out with things that won't roll against me if they whisper me for invites at the same time as ones who will.
---
Gorak has a [strained relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvc5ykZYS3U) with those apples :D

---
"Well, good thing I never have to run that again!"
---
If this was released as a private server it would be dead in under a week.
---
If you supply both the tank and hunters yes that’s fine. If you pugged a tank or a hunter I disagree.
---
Sure, then you don't have to join.
---
Stating what the rules are before joining is fine - even if it was just 1 person organising it and the rest are pugs. IDC. Because they knew the rules beforehand.
---
You have an issue? Dont' join. Do a guild run.
---
&gt;if a civilian is attacked. 
---
No, if you enter their aggro radius
---
How? In which way?
---
Thanks so much man, it makes me really happy when people like them enough to share them ! You are now an honorary Orc!
---
When do they improve it?
---
&gt;LF all strat LIVE ORBS RES
---
Haha, the part with him snapping the crayon with his bare thumb got me good
---
But if you are pugging MC then either you don't have a guild that can run it or you're not in the team that runs MC. Or you missed that weeks' run
---
So, if it's an option between running MC and not running MC...then most would choose to run it.
---
Plus entirely optional to join.

Then you can't bitch like...wtf...there are solutions in place for your issue and you're choosing to intentionally not make use of them.

I don't know the exact details. But here is the first old post on the official forums I could find backing up the claim that this was done.
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/4421992665?page=2#post-26
---
It isn't important enough to argue about any further, I was just sharing the anecdote. Maybe its hearsay.
---
As a player with multiple characters in both factions, I can say that i’ve had more positive experiences with Alliance as a horde than the other way around. Undead are the scummiest lol. 
---
Pvp servers are close to 60% horde though so it’s to be expected🍳
---
Because it goes nowhere?
---
It’s too bad you aren’t still lying down when you log back in!
---
So why did the paladin get prio on every single piece?  It's ridiculus that you don't understand that the paladin getting all that shit alone - ignoring everyhing else, is corruption.
---
I think you've cracked the case
---
I'm also part of a cult. All undead guild. Pretty fun.
---
Whats so lucrative about farming argent dawn reputation ?
---
It should be a rule that if you reserve you have to pass on all other gear. Not even greed.
---
Everyone knows a real man bubbles himself and lets the mage tank!
---
I generally skin my own mobs and leave everything else to fastest person. Never had issues but I also dont care to lose out too much
---
Or hard 2 man.  Everyone making reserve groups as a rogue is doing it wrong.
---
My guild had two drop the first kill we made, myself and another tank were very happy.
---
It means ur mac os needs to be updated had the same issue on myn
---
Again, why disband when you can kick instead?  That is my question.
---
I'm not concerned about the drama, it just doesn't make sense from a mechanical perspective.  If people are causing issues, that typically doesn't warrant a disband.   Perhaps someone is  playing too much eve online.
---
You’ve provided 0 argument. You are wrong in every way. You’re spreading false information on this sub for someone asking a genuine question you trash bag.
---
You mean they aren’t changing the meta every few weeks, like they do in League of Legends?
---
Right now we’re in the aoe meta, can’t wait for the bruiser meta. When the healer meta takes over, it’s gonna be pretty cancer though. No one will die.

Are you on Oceanic servers?  Arugal and Yojamba can move to Felstriker, I believe. You don't need a queue to initiate the transfer, just click 'shop' on the character list and it will come up if it's available. Apologies if you already knew this.
---
Female night elf 100%! The males do have great beards, though... but they're so bulky and shoulder pads always look enormous on them. Not really part of the class fantasy for rogues, imo.

Yes the reputation gain on humans saves no time if you end up farming Darnassus rep. But they make a great #2 option if you're not keen on the night elf.

The problem is they didn't do that to us. The people who did that to us are level 60s. You're just perpetuating the cycle of revenge.
---
I use an addon that lets me put people who gank me on a kill list, and then notifies me when I run into them again. After I take true revenge, I take them off the list. That is true justice.
---
Eh no. I just suffered from the debuff.
---
OP sounds like he thought HIS guild was #3 lmao
---
This dropped for me the other day and I needed on it but so did the tank who then sold it (!?!?!!?!!?!?!?) But I wondered from the start because the way its presented is weird- is that + damage to your shadow damage, or is that + shadow damage on hit? Is it really good for warlocks?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1482/shadowfang yes, it's BOE.
---
True.  I have an undead rogue alt ... I feel a little dirty when I play him.
---
What do you guys do to spice up the monotony of Priest leveling?
---
If you told yourself you’re going to buy every color of every epic mount from every faction and you’re going to earn the gold from level 1 mob vendor trash drops, that would happen before you would ever see Deathcharger’s Reins.  This drop isn’t about gold.
---
Atiesh (PVE) is always pretty jumpin
---
Not necessarily. The server have like 8500, 9000 cap with two layers. Some servers already have high queue again. The server cap will be halved before P2 and not everyone will want to sit in a 7000 queue every night, so I expect some transfers still. Sure some low servers will be dead, but some of them will be healthy maybe.
---
DM E is coming in 2 days, team up with a healer (they also barely can farm by themselves) and you can 2 man it for good amounts of gold.
---
Yo what addons you using??
---
Nope, that's exactly what you get to reserve and it's entirely standard.
---
The laugh alone puts it on top scumbag. Ganking someone that smacking them with that phat kek and laugh is brutal. *male undead voice* Muhahahaha.
---
water
---
Damn what piece of gear did you lose recently?
---
Exactly this.
---
If you plan on leveling quickly, then dumping gold on BoEs or enchants won't save you much time at all since you'll be replacing it as soon as you level up and find better gear.
---
Should probably only consider buying BoEs around the 48 - 52 level mark where the gear will last until the mid to late 50s.
---
Should just focus on strength/stam items or "of the Bear" suffixed equips of they're cheap enough on AH or found as a quest reward.
---
No, instead the entire server has to deal with their spam for 2 hours straight. The irony in reserving Star of Mystaria while simultaneously asking for a spellcleave group is cause for 24hr timeout.
---
Right now? 
---
Mara. You solo the goblin, princess, and the crocodile. It’ll net you 50g per hour just vendoring the blues.
---
However, if you sell items off any of these mobs (some are very high demand rn) for like 20-30g each you can easily push into 100g territory.
---
A warlock in my guild made 200g in one hour one time because the ring kept dripping off princess and he had buyers lined up.
---
How come dreadforge retaliator instead of nicker? or are they comparable
---
Not to mention it turns every mage into a full blown retard that tries to single target aoe shit
---
I don’t need to I’m on stalagg and I would just like to play on the West not the East and I’m only lvl 25 so it won’t be that big of a deal
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn
---
Turned down tanking for a group for deadmines because they had a reserve list. I didn't even need anything on that list, but i didn't want to support that kinda mentality. I see the benefit as the alternative is just not bringing anywho who might want the hear, but not at lvl 19.
---
How’s the horde ally ratio?
---
Happened to me with Riposte as well
---
You need it for shoulder enchant.
---
I mean, sometimes they are.
---
But I dunno why you'd go in expecting that of every raid.
---
I knew this kind of shit could happen. Sorry men.
---
Fire spec, with full +damage gear Pray for stuns.
---
I was running ZF with another warrior and the stun staff dropped. I said "is that good for warriors?" he said "no, it's trash".
---
It doesn't have any stats, but the high end damage is good and the proc is fun so I rolled need. He just cursed at me and left the group immediately. What a joke
---
Yes and lets make the leveling faster. Also I believe we should add a group finder and to make it easier we should split up larger dungeons like BRD into several wings. Then we could also add an incentive to run random dungeons for the people who don't need dungeon loot anymore. We could give points that allows them to purchase current gear sets. 
---
Ohh wait, now we are in retail.
---
Hi future-people!

They wont transfer you anything. The only thing they will do is delete the item in question
---
ITT a bunch of people who reserve loot 😂
---
might wanna warn people about your KB giving them a seizure
---
I'm sorry.
---
When phase two hits you're going to be kicking yourself when you see them for sale for the 500g minimum
---
Thrall and Sylvanas are paying out the ass for their services I guarantee it. If they're not charging us fare you bet they're getting paid in some other way.
---
Are terrible flight paths actually worth it? No but it's the way it was so who cares? If you want more conveniences there's several tbc and what not servers.
---
What's so good about that, and what else is worth grinding rep for?
---
Use your professions. Farm mats, make things, cooking and fishing.
---
60/40 Alliance/Horde
---
The main thing at this point in the game is shoulder enchants. The only shoulder enchants in the game require AD rep. Also, when Naxx comes out, at least having Honored is required for Naxx attunement, and every step above that is a cost reduction in attunement.
---
Wish horde got the venomhide ravasaur
---
There is a proximity requirement
---
One really enjoyable video about it all is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FETDudTcFXg
---
Yeah, decay seems necessary. We have a heavy decay in our guild to incentivize spending it.
---
But also, you can have dkp with restrictions on legendaries.
---
Both seem like common sense parts of any dkp system.
---
Not just wow. Every mmo ever has a tank shortage throughout the vast majority of its lifespan if it's the kind that requires tank to do content.
---
Funniest thing ever. RNG is a bitch. I got my HoJ in my first BRD run...and I don't even wanted it, because I am a tank since MMORPGs were born, and HoJ is basically crap for raid tanking. At least in my opinion. But this is not the point.
---
Ran BRD with guild probably 100 times since than, with people that actually wanted it.
---
It didn't dropped again. And there were multiple BRD runs from the guild, with same purpose. They also ran it 100 times+. They have seen it drop only ONCE.
---
Lesson : RNG is RNG. And since you don't look like a dick, reserving it, and waiting hours until your grp starts rolling...you are better of not reserving it.
---
Then suck it up or get some friends
---
He did not have actual power over the other leaders because the other leader and his friend were the founders of the guild. It was a co leadership guild by the looks of it.
---
From one of the [pre-beta interviews](https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/blizzard/281116/world-of-warcraft-classic-preview-impressions):
---
&gt;But Birmingham said that he understands that some players might like to experience the Blood Plague again when Zul'Gurub releases in Phase 4:
---
&gt;"I would be lying if I didn't say it came up," Birmingham said. "We all had a good laugh about that experience. [Bringing it back] sounds interesting. I don't have any plans to announce today, but it's certainly something we thought was an amusing idea."
---
Nothing confirmed, but it's also not deconfirmed either.
---
I highly recommend Thunderfury. Never a queue, not totally unbalanced horde/alliance, easy to find groups, etc.
---
Hi, /u/mepins
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhi3a0/snakesnakesnaaaaaaaaakes/). 
---
Eh, if they were gonna hit argle too I would have joined that group (as a healer) for more chances at my Second Wind. That basically just means they need some casters.
---
Who the fuck thinks they are deserving enough to reserve the mount?
---
Either everyone gets to roll on the cool cosmetic item, or you can go play with the rest of your entitled selves.
---
Reserving gear is fine, and makes sense. This? This is pathetic.
---
It was nothing but a ninja. Hamish has misrepresented out of context or old information with the sole intent of tarnishing the guilds remaining leadership. At no point does he mention that most items, bar a few that make agreed sense to the guild, are put up for roll between classes or players. Ask any actual guild member about their opinions on the decisions of the loot council. You won't find much disagreement.
---
i can accept reserved loot if that person is carrying the entire team
---
Felhunter's ability paranoia increases the range you can see stealthed people from. Against rouges specifically I'd choose the succ, but felhunter is a pretty solid choice in general
---
This is why I play WOW
---
your graphics are garbage
---
Oh D.  Ooohhhh D.
---
If it gets to a point where there's too many reserve groups and they're not being filled, people will stop reserving or they'll wait longer to try and fill their reserve group. It balances itself.
---
We have no mods on it, mods were given out day1 to anyone who said "me" and nobody does anything
---
Pandas heirlooms and no more rolling on loot just give people random pieces but dont change tge stats
---
Make a macro where you undress yourself and sell yourself for gold to the next person who passes by.
---
If you are retaining the 10% hit in both cases, option 1 is better.
---
You fucked up😂
---
Take those points out of improved slam and put em in enrage. Slam is pretty non useful and the talents even less so. Id also take points out of cleave and go into flurry. 
---
Edit: also you could finish 2H wep spec by taking 2 points from cleave and still get 5 enrage points.
---
Pet battles and welfare epics.
---
You don't need hit on every piece. You take hit on pieces with relatively small amounts of armor, or no armor at all (i.e.Bloodmail Boots + Onyxia Tooth Pendant). This is much less of a downgrade than sacrificing the Breastplate for a level 52 mail chest.
---
If you're already at the hit cap, on a Prot Warrior, in current content, with DPS in your raid that aren't even in full T1? You don't need more threat. The survival is better.
---
Where is your guild?
---
I cannot imagine doing this without at least a grp of 5 protecting me from same and opposite faction players.
---
Yeah unfriendly took me less than an hour
---
What's it worth?
---
Like 0.001% tanks are actually tanks because so few are needed whereas guilds stack fury warriors.
---
I'd be interested in how it's better in any scenario?
---
I have it on my lock but there are a few pre-raid alternatives that are better.
---
I never said I don't condone it, I just don't do it on my main.
---
Yesterday I was running wc. We ended the dungeon and I still needed 14 leathers. Everyone bounced but the healer. It took almost an hour but he stayed with me. Good times.
---
Can't blame him. These guys couldn't even clear naxx playing private servers 8 hours a day
---
Questie?
---
I’m sorry I’m new to wow, can someone explain this situation to me like I’m 5?
---
What you're doing is hazing logic. "This bad thing happened to me, and it won't be fair until I do it to other unrelated third parties." Your underlying logic is actually responsible for a huge amount of what is wrong with humanity and the world.
---
Ok well farming is pve so I guess I’ll be the one laughing at you.
---
On any kind of aoe farming (hearthglen, dm west, zg crocodile farm) it is literally god tier item. Why? Blizzard and hellfire both hit every second. If ANY mob in the aoe gets a proc, it procs on all the mobs. 
---
Aoeing 10 mobs? One proc = 1000 extra damage to the pack. That’s almost another blizzard off one proc.
---
This also essentially means that you have infinite mana as a mage.
---
This means you never have to drink water. Do you know how much your gpm will go up if you never have to mana up while farming? It’s a lot.
---
Naxx items don’t have this kind of utility let alone mageblade.
---
Me too :(
---
How are you going to wear the Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight AND a hit chest at the same time?
---
Haha this made me laugh, and thats rare! Very nice animation and editing
---
Yep, this. 60 tries and counting for Arena Chest, no way I'm risking it to a roll.
---
Kite a warlock?
---
I've heard that quick slams in between auto attacks are good, but maybe that's outdated information.
---
If you do every single quest, you’ll reach the start of revered (as a human). I did teldrassil, darkshore, ashenvale, stonetalon, desolace, and feralas and barely squeezed by into revered.
---
What is mass looting
---
This is a pretty funny meme!  But **actually** if you ask a forensic anthropologist (someone with a scientific PhD) they could tell you _just by looking at a skull_ whether it belonged to a white person, a black person, an Asian person, a man, or a woman.
---
_**Today you learned!**_
---
Mass looting. Thatd be all right I guess. I dont mind single looting, but wouldn't be pissed if we could mass loot.
---
No on the vellum. I am against anything that cuts out social aspects of the game.
---
LFG built in
---
It is so aids at the mo getting pugs
---
whats the addon to highlight guild names?
---
If your raid doesn’t need  higher TPS yet than chances are people are pretty shit. Any decent guild is reaching the point where tanks are swapping fury/prot and looking to get daggers or uncontested weapons for higher TPS.
---
I am disc, can definitely hold my own.. questing is just much slower than dungeon spam.
---
Bank king
---
Guidelime
---
This was great!
---
Pet Attack Speed may be relevant for pvp but its normalized meaning other than push back theres no advantage to a quick attack speed
---
Oh my server is like high/full and it's getting spammed with lfg
---
I mean, I love good faith stories but this one doesn't even tell us what you were assisting with at all. You can't just leave us hanging on the actual details!
---
Brah do you know how gear funneling works?
---
As a tank I suppose you could reserve the veins, going to be a lot of 55+ that wants to run it :P
---
If it's red it's dead.
---
Walk with the Earthmother.
---
The best racial isn’t even key bound though?
---
No vellum makes enchanting pretty worthless and enchant mats under valued.
---
It procs off a cast. Not a hit. Thanks for the laugh
---
&gt; challenging dungeons
---
Those don't come until TBC, if your heal set is decent you can stay enhancement forever
---
Gnome. Female. Pigtails.
---
Loot one body, and all lootable bodies get looted.
---
BWL comes in like what? 4 or 5 months? Assuming you start raiding now, a total of at least 320 pieces of gear should fall. Even if you completely favor half the raid, the other half will still have at least 4 epics each.
---
It took me until like level 28 to realize I had see hidden. Those abilities get buried in your ability book.
---
/join trade, it's limited to capital cities though
---
LFM BRD Arena runs (Ban‘thok sash locked)
---
Yeah no. Luckily these people get shamed into the ground when they pop up in LFG... yet. 
---
LOCKED sounds even worse than reserved, but is standard on German servers
---
No shit
---
Makes reading LFG channel super annoying for starters when you have 74 reserve groups spamming their lfm for 3 hours.
---
Adding LFG would make me unsub. (Again).
---
Because it’s fun. One doesn’t have to care about it to embrace it.
---
And for the record, all people who play WoW are “RP Players”. If we chopped up boars all day with an axe, there’d be no need to play.
---
Change my Mind
---
Ganking is fine. Camping and streaming it all night is another.
---
*no* effort
---
Definitely confused why there aren't more warlocks atm, I remember them being everywhere in vanilla. Maybe it's because pvp isn't open right now.
---
Actually DPS are in more demand than healers from what I've seen.
---
They're not neutral, they're the true enemies of the game. Mobs are mobs, but level 60 lowbie gankers are the fucking heart of darkness.
---
Super controversial, but... LFG because like others I mostly get to play at off-peak hours and finding a group for anything other than WC or endgame instances is practically impossible.
---
Same. I remember vividly my 12 year old self being super proud after kiting and killing lvl 60s on my 39 Hunter
---
Laugh all the way to the bank (AH).  
---
Shrug it off, BoE epics are fair game.
---
That's it.  I'm going to Redridge.  Revenge time.
---
Eql3 lets your move the log wherever and keeps it there. Extended Quest Log 3 is the name I believe. I have it
---
But it is one with the effect of: regenerates alot of mana out of combat. 
---
But it rly proofes to me, that apparently Mages think they are too good to hand out stuff they get for free, that makes life soooooo much easier for the peasant non mage classes. Just imagine if other classes would do such things. Such like tanks not taunting off from mages and healers not healing mages. (becouse tbh, a dungeon is doable without that. just alot harder.)
---
Just stick it up your arse and realise, you fucking have to provide free water and food to the group. Its not even like you need to kill mobs for it, unlike locks have to do for their usefull stuff.
---
orbs in strath liv, gems in lbrs for the ubrs key, rarely witchblade in scholo.  
---
Ah ofc head of ony and recently vis'kag as well.
---
Im raiding as boomkin atm, my 2 cents.
---
Overall the spec is meh, in dungeon vs bosses im first/second all depends on rng gods but in raid expect to be in the top 15 only if really lucky or other suck balls, you have that nice 2% hit from pieces and in Mc you get 3/4 resists in row, you have to down rank on certain bosses to not oom and gimp your dps.
---
Other than that the mages group love me and im having fun.
---
Yup, I bailed too.
---
Flasks are a money sink for tryhards change my mind
---
Or I join and need on it nonetheless
---
Engineer mining pretty good combo. Good for pvp, and the door does need a bomb that requires engineering to use. Plus dire maul east has thorium to mine at the end.
---
As if horde aren’t the ones doing this.
---
For most endgame raid content, you have to complete some sort of objective before being allowed to even enter the dungeon. For MC, it's a simple "retrieve an item from the depts of BRD" quest and... boom. You're now allowed to enter the Molten Core. For Ony the process is a lot more complicated and involves a long faction-specific quest chain. The end result is you get a necklace that allows you to be able to enter the instance. More "attunements" will become necessary as endgame content gets released.
---
Okay, stohp dohts....
---
Can you filter to search for multiple items? I want to search three types of ore or bars at the same time. Can I do that.
---
Haha oops! You got played
---
Roll is a bad system imo. In /roll I can have been to every raid and thus have most of my gear, but I need a few very specific pieces. Then Mr. Rareguy comes with us to the raid and obviously gets a ton of shit because he took part in almost no raid. Then my item drops that I hoped for for 3 weeks already and he rolls higher then me. 
---
In a DKP system I could just outbid him, because I will obviously have more DKP and in a loot council I would be awarded the item being more important.
---
What is this? explain.
---
Doing green+ quests in your free time is actually reasonable cash so I’d say do most of the ones available if they’re solo able and not too annoying.
---
Don’t forget that in lieu of xp the good reward of quests when you’re at level cap is vastly increased.
---
what quest is this
---
Maybe try completely uninstalling ElvUI and then reinstalling it?
---
Yes, but rename yourself to Gustavo Almadovar \*head twist\*
---
Youd be surprised at the number of group I've seen unwilling to extend a run 5m to kill golem. Idk how you're gonna find any caster if you just do arena and anger
---
Of course they are, they are outnumbered in most contested zones so whenever they have an advantage they take it as an opportunity to release some of that bottled up anger and ptsd.
---
Blaumeux
---
Props to you.
---
Open up your Questie settings. Under the BDM tab, uncheck the alert. That should solve it.
---
Actually, you people who object to this practice are the ones being little-brained.
---
Here's an example of my most common scenario:
---
Warrior tank (me), healer friend, and two random clothie DPS are heading to BRD. I (the warrior tank) am searching LFG for our last DPS. I get 30 responses within 30 seconds for our 'BRD Arena, Anger, Golemlord spam' runs. As a warrior who needs rare drops off of two of those bosses, why would I invite a rogue or another warrior? I can form any group I want with ease. So why make it harder on myself to get the gear I need? 
---
Instead of saying 'no rogues, enh shaman, warriors, or hunters' or 'clothies only' I can simply inform people that HOJ or Savage Chain is reserved. That way the DPS can decide for themselves if they want to join my group, and my group can have more class diversity, which is good for my healer and the two clothie DPS I already have. I don't need rogue leather or daggers, I just need my HOJ. If the rogue/warrior already has his or doesn't mind not rolling on it in the event of a drop (unlikely to drop anyways), then I'd prefer to group with him so none of our gear goes to waste. 
---
It's a mutually beneficial agreement. The rogue was never forced to come. He chose to.
---
Obviously, none of this applies to groups that form only to THEN proceed to reserve stuff once the group starts clearing or heading to the dungeon. That's dumb and scummy. And yes, the people looking for clothies for Arena/Angerforge only spams are dumb as rocks. There's a reason they spam LFG and trade for hours without finding groups.
---
I guess, it's hard to say rly.
---
i wouldnt have even cared if we roll and he wins who cares but he also left the group before we finished the escort that actually tilts me more
---
I mean its not really about min maxing and more about the fact that youre going to get far more HoJ/WF procs with flurry than you will with sword spec. This might be a "fun" build but a 2h dps warrior without flurry is seriously gimping the spec.
---
God those fucking nachos though man. Nothing else like em.
---
Great! Thanks for the help.
---
IGankLowbiesTTV
---
good to know ty
---
Lmao, ok mate, you’ve got no fucking idea
---
Some people just don't like the ganking aspect of the game. Oh well, their loss if they can't enjoy minorly inconveniencing people.
---
cool, thanks
---
Yah everyone is just rolling mage for aoe spam leveling to farm gold
---
The important thing is that you found a way to feel superior about it.
---
No tank will run around in MC gear when we get to Patchwerk. Stuff is like a year away at least. By that point a guild that progresses into Naxx will have looted and disenchanted thousands of epics.
---
No reason to downvote, that addon has given me many groups and saved me s lot of time. It’s just making the process easier. I’ve added many new friends from such groups. 
---
We still have to run to the instance. It’s still classic. I don’t see why anyone would be against this.
---
I do enjoy watching those desperate gear reserving players.
---
Wtf are you people sitting at the meeting stone waiting for tank? You do whatever solo content you were doing at full efficiency, then when the group has been formed you move to the dungeon. Getting a tank now or getting it in 40 minutes makes no difference really.
---
People reserve mount drops in ZG raids when ran with pugs. This is not very different. Its a mount. Hes the group owner. He is setting loot rules. You join if you agree with it. Its not an arguement over entiltement or anything. Calm down.
---
Loot council seems like a worst idea ever
---
Apparently Edgemaster's only affects one-handed weapons! I'm not quite 60 yet but Obsidian Edged Blade would definitely be on my radar as soon as I get there.
---
I'm a new player which is why I was asking the question. Good job proving time and again that classic wow will always have asswipes though, be proud :)
---
have you guys not seen this?

---
the post was dated from the 12th but it was still the 11th in america. it was the 12 during normal business hours in china.  
---
even if you try to say " maybe they posted in europe" .. blizzard isn't posting an official statement at 1am in the UK
---
Wait that's illegal
---
I've made an alt on Dragonfang EU, it's the only low pop server here. All cities are empty, you might find 3-4 people in the bank/AH area at a time, and it's virtually impossible to find a group for a dungeon. Once i saw 4 different groups for the same dungeon looking for a tank, there were just no tanks. Other time there was a tank and a healer looking just for dps, there were nobody at their lvl range willing to join. I'm 30ish and haven't done a single dungeon and I don't think I until endgame.
---
That being said, I'm not complaining, this is exactly what I was looking for. It's actually quite an interesting experience to play on a barren realm like this. Absolutely no competition on quests and gathering materials, almost feels like a singleplayer game.
---
That actually seems like a good idea and would let me keep the sword spec shenanigans, thanks!
---
And how much MC gear do you need that drops rare enough to not drop for every member of the class after 50 runs?
---
Head to Darkshire, we're more concentrated in the graveyard and easier to kill.
---
Official app not virtual pc workaround. Yes I know it’s possible.
---
I was off-tanking in MC earlier this week. 
---
I leveled as Prot, so honestly I don’t know what gear you’ll need, as I was just tanking the whole way to 60 and grabbing upgrades. 
---
What I can say is that dungeon tanking is pretty damn smooth if people understand how aggro works. 
---
What I can say is that the Deathbone set from Scholomance is perfect for Prot Pallies. So if you’re running that and see pieces drop, Snap them up!
---
Hey, if you didn't want to get killed and camped by a skulled player while questing in contested zones, you shouldn't have rolled a PVP server.
---
Same. Lol
---
And correct me if i’m wrong, these corrupt guys were his irl friends?
---
It's more like "smile in Faerie Fire".
---
I throw it out, think to myself "Yes I think that's what I'm supposed to do", and then soon after think "what the hell do I do now?!"
---
I'm not very good.
---
Username checks out
---
It’s definitely mage prio. The crit aura benefits the raid the most. In terms of individual benefit, Druid gets the most bang for their buck.
---
Can you change name in classic? Because if not he’s fucked. Even if he transfers to Yojamba people will know.
---
Some grey con mage suicided on my warrior the other day and I was like "OK dude if you wanted to die just say so, quit running around like you're going to live."
---
High quality and funny as hell.
---
Was this on Golemagg?
---
You don't even have to vanish. If you kill him fast enough you can stealth before the mob rushes in.
---
Ah I see you play on [random server name but I dunno about you I just feel the need to complain]
---
Like I said I wasn’t trying to skin everything I just took a couple. When he asked me to stop and that he deserved them all because I was a cloth wearer and no one else from the group said anything I wasn’t sure.
---
I actually kept skinning but got some angry whispers from him about it.
---
Tried that too, deleted the WTF folder as well so it was a "fresh" install. No luck.
---
How and why?
---
Except people who say this always find a reason to avoid even fights and mostly just gank lowbies and get steamrolled by even levels players.
---
Arent we hating on blizzard bois?
---
Im fond of Welcome to the Jungle myself.
---
I am right now muahahaha
---
Why do I feel so triggered by this??? Lol
---
Flurry is the payoff for going deep into the fury tree. No point in going this deep into fury tree if you’re not going to get it. 
---
You need an efficient rage spender (heroic strike double dips on rage), so you need to pick one of mortal strike or bloodthirst. 
---
As others have mentioned, enrage is a very valuable DPS talent.
---
Restorative potions help with those most of the time they are only a nuisance
---
Agreed. Dungeons are a great change of pace, and some blue gear is a neat little bonus. But once or twice, and then you are ready to set off to a new zone and next line of questing. Reserved in leveling is basically meaningless.
---
Curious, was it the ganking that made it bad or other stuff too?
---
red is dead
---
Your reddit history shows your havinga rough day. Did someone piss in your cereal?
---
i don't know, +3% hit chance, +3% dmg and crit against pretty much everything in the game, +15% agility and +3% crit looks like damage talent.
---
Also, it still give enough pts left for improved aspect of the hawk and everything needed in markmaship except the +5% weapon damage and trushot aura.
---
What you wrote: Unorthodox.
---
What you meant: Bad.
---
I really wonder if the price is actually gonna spike up. 
---
1.) Content will come out in a faster pace, making people less likely to get bored of main chatacters
---
2.) So many people stocking up these items, some even in large quantity, i just don't know how that will end up
---
Your mom said the same thing.
---
When you kill someone 10+ levels above you :) Now that feels good!
---
A tank could easily reserve all that and form the stated group in under 5 minutes at most.
---
Sounds like a fun pun on the guild name
---
If you have a good set of Int/Spirit/MP5/+healing gear, you can stay enhancement just fine for 5/10 man dungeons.
---
If you want to go MC/Ony, most guilds will want you to go resto. 
---
So I'd stay stick with ench, start collecting resto gear, and when you feel ready to raiding, then swap to resto.
---
This. I immediately turned this off. I don’t want floating quest markers on my screen in a seemingly random way.
---
Dont even have to vanish if you kill him fast enough.  You can restealth.
---
Hey, the King is back!
---
survival still have a good chunk of damage talents have you still have enough pts to take the one in markmanship. A survival hunter won't do like 10/20% less damage than a marksman.
---
&gt;It does decent damage
---
I'd like to see some logs please.
---
If you think combat rogue has no chance of winning in a 1v1 you're a shit rogue.
---
https://i.imgur.com/VFHd1CX.jpg
---
Dude... I miss that game.
---
Wah
---
Ok man. I was not trying to start some meta discussion about paladins. We both agree they dont do good dps. My point is that it used to be worse. And yours is that it doesnt matter because how terrible they still.
---
Link inside? Link inside what? Inside the video? That doesn't even make sense.
---
Iv lost it 7 times. 5 of them i became in second. I'm getting ready to start doing reserve runs to save my sanity....
---
No, it’s diminished (to 20% of the original value) if the mob is gray to you. Being at or below level cap by itself makes no difference.
---
And this applies only to rep gained from killing mobs. Quests are always giving full reputation.
---
I like the idea of a priest. Everyone makes a good point with having resurrect and being able to cure and dispel
---
Am I the only one who doesn't mind these reserved types of posts?  Is it stupid as hell?  Yes.  Would I ever do it myself?  No.  But if someone wants to waste time trying to get people to come to a group with no chance at loot, rather than just running it a bunch of times AND is transparent about the looting up front, I have zero problem with it.
---
Gear allows you an advantage over people who are the same level as you.  If you have to gank lowbies to get kills then maybe you should get stronger and "gear up" more.
---
I personally dont care. I think that anyone who's willing to make a group is entitled to his rules as long as he's transparent.
---
I have never put things on reserve, but if I wanted specific items I usually built groups around the idea that I would be the only one rolling on specific items.
---
This seems to be the standard right now, and as long as all that’s being reserved is mats and bindings, seems like a pretty small price to pay to join a random group. Like it’s not even about the guild having X percent of the raid makeup. It’s about anyone being willing to lead a raid. And before anyone says that anyone can lead a raid, you’re not wrong but you’re not right. Anyone can just as easy as these groups make a group and invite people to do the content. Being successful and knowledgeable about the content, sure it’s not vanilla and the info is easy to find. But still to raid lead and take initiative that in itself id say makes this okay. If you don’t like it, don’t join the group. If it’s upfront in all of your lfg posts about what you’re reserving it’s okay. Again people can make their own groups and run it if they don’t like it. I’ve seen people saying this is something to do with retail kids. Anyone who thinks that’s a moron. Well through at least wrath I know pugs even made up of just 1 random person who decided to start a raid group would reserve 1 or 2 drops, I don’t recall early vanilla even allowing for pugs for MC as most players and guilds actually had to progress through the content, so I don’t remember specific items that Groups might have reserved. But the most memorable for me were groups in BC that would res DST from gruul as content much harder than that didn’t get pugged at the time. My guild in wrath would host alt runs of normal mode content and if there happened to be a drop that a guild member needed on their main we’d reserve it, example the caster trinket from ToTC, me and another mage from our guild would go on our mains and reserve it, and we always filled those groups fast because guild names mattered and a pug hosted by a good guild will fill even with a couple reserves. Like seriously claiming this is some epidemic stemming from people that never played vanilla and are only use to the newer product is uneducated and people just salty because other players are getting items they aren’t.

&gt;Not sure if you guys have been leads before, but being a Guild Leader is significantly different than being an officer or member.
---
Does running a business in real life count?
---
&gt;The amount of stuff you put up with can get hectic. And the fact his officers/leads were plotting against the GM AND the Guild, 'controlling' anything is out of the question.
---
From what you're saying, if a select few of my employees decided to steal from me and my customers, re:collusion, I should fuck over my entire employee and customer base, and reopen a new franchise and completely rebrand it? And all this because I was too "overwhelmed" to fire or take reasonable action against my saboteurs/scammers?
---
Seems to me that you don't have any management experience or the depth to make tough decisions.
---
Yeah, on my server lvl 60 dps are entitled AF because it feels like all the people that rushed to 60 are healers or tanks
---
Straight up dummy noob
---
If a ticket is made and both parties agree it was an accident, most GMs will transfer it. It's tricky because some groups will have multiple people roll need on an item so they can trade it to their friend if they win it. But with master loot, an accident is more understandable
---
I just don't like seeing people getting conned into rolling a paladin think they'll be viable dps tbh. All over this forum (less now) people were saying that it's fine and to roll ret and I even saw people claiming ret was higher than fury and defending it fervently. Then people believe that schlock and roll a class only to find out that ret isn't viable for dps at all leading to them quitting them or begrudgingly speccing for heals.

Every time I'm friendly they just wait to outnumber and gank. Red is dead.

Innervate with 6 min cd is enough to not drink between fights?

Idk I think this is reaching a bit. To me it just reads like it was written by a PR team who drafted and re-drafted it about five times over. Which is disingenuous in itself but completely standard corporate damage control behaviour.
---
It was human or gnome, and picking gnome is like going to an amusement park and being to short to ride any of the rides.
---
And that Herod shoulder is iconic for a reason. A couple of classes end up wearing that pretty much through UBRS if the drop gods desire it.
---
&gt; [1. General - Tanaris] [Player]: God I hate getting ganked every 15 seconds. When I reach 60 I'm gonna start ganking every lowby I swear.
---
The hate trickles down.

I like to run dungeons drunk, but only if I can find my way in as a DPS.  Tanking drunk is a recipe for frustration, but I could Sweeping Strikes &gt; Whirlwind spam no matter what my mental state.

Stop posting and spreading bullshit nonsense please.

It’s THE BEST item in the game for aoe farming. Period.
---
I’ve tested specifically this item on different classes with different aoes and it works exactly as described. Just shut the fuck up!!
---
Got killed by a mage 10 levels higher than me in tanaris last night, after I died he spammed the g O tOReTail shit. Got a group of 3 and camped him for 2 hours. Who’s headed back to retail now? friggen jerk!

Did they let him get away with it ?

Backing up what Kris is advising. 2% crit is far better than that Agi. Far.

Yes, good guilds will go into Naxx with all of the gear. If they survive that long. Guilds rise and fall. Players join and leave the game.

I'm 58 with 0 points in MoD and I can pickpocket BRD mobs standing right in front of their face. Just stand as far as you can while still being able to use the ability. 
---
Occasionally they resist pickpocket and I have to vanish.
---
Is it getting out of hand? Just don't group with them?
---
Hes lvl 24. Oof
---
I'm not really having an issue as a pally. Mind you I have the movement speed talent (8%) and freedom/bop talent in prot. I routinely chase down mages way over my lvl. You win some, you lose some, but it's a whole lot of fun!
---
My favourite thing is when I help an ally being ganked. A warrior was getting roughed up by 2 rogues, I managed to get off a holy light just in time! Then another to top him off, we focused one of them down, and the other ran with his tail behind his legs. Really gets my blood going, in a good way 😁
---
How do you transfer, blizz said this is not possible
---
Did your mom forget to bring the chicken tendies to the basement?
---
Not even remotely, if your forming a group as a tank you can make whatever damn rules you want. Just make it clear before hand and they can choose to join or not
---
Lmao wow that is next level reserve
---
Since you are a shaman spam chain heal if the group takes dmg or use lesser healing wave for less dmg on tank. You can Google which spells are efficient to downrank for saving mana throughout a boss fight
---
Thats my problem when people talk loot council and greatest benefit.
---
The actual greatest benefit is to gear up one person at a time with bis gear. Spreading it around is lot worse.
---
If you have a warrior, stick BRE on him and rest of the gear spread around on others, you would gain less. Things like crit and hit scale exponentially. That one person would most often gain more total dps than others if you look at spreadsheets.
---
&gt; It’s increased dmg to the bonus dmg of cleave which amounts to an extra like 30-40 dmg per cleave for 3 points.
---
cleave is +50. 3/3 imp cleave would make it +120 on both targets, for a total of 140 dmg (before armor)
---
thanks
---
That guilds now "Live to Win" on Heartseeker right? Still trash I heard.
---
A rare spawn in UBRS that drops a bis caster trinket, briarwood reed. I think it's bis until neltharions tear, a Nefarian drop. So it's bis for a very long time

you unirioncically are giving paladins mageblade and telling casters to farm mara dagger. How much more autism can you pump into your raiders?

Shouldn't a good warlock beat anything in a 1v1, tho?

"pickpockets"* was spelled incorrectly on the emote...
---
Are you running enhancement as a shaman? If so I already foresee problems in the horizon for you brother
---
You know what stands out to me? 
---
All the people that were on the bandwagon leading up to classic launch, who were so insistent on the importance of community, making friends, and garnering a reputation for themselves... DID EXACTLY THAT. lmao we hit the ground running, made friends, found our favorite tanks, healers, and dps, formed guilds, and didn't have to worry about pugs at all. To all the folk that somehow managed to level up \~60 and totally failed to make connections.. that's all on you guys.
---
Could someone tell me what happened using words I understand? I feel like there’s something juicy here, but I don’t play
---
lol stfu dude, that mace for pvp with mace specc can be insane for Rogues  
---
there is no fucking "this gets prio"
---
And now you're bitching about me bitching about his bitching...guess it's all just a cycle lol...
---
They just change to master lot on their boss and don't advertise it
---
I'd consider taking Parry over imp heroic strike. Heroic Strike is really bad for damage, and rage management in general. You should only ever be using it if you can't cast anything else that cost's rage, and your next auto would put you over rage cap (that's wasting rage); so by making it 2 rage points cheaper, you're not really helping yourself move that goal post away from the cover cap mark.
---
The imp parry is more useful in pve and in pvp. Putting those 2 points into deflection increases the number of parries that you get by 33%, assuming you've got no parry on your gear. Thinking of it that way, you can actually see how good it is when you've got all 5 points in it. That means you parry twice as much from baseline. Especially when you're considering that you're going for sword spec, and having HoJ I'd assume. You've got a 7% chance to get parry hasted, and your attacks have a 7% chance to deal double damage. That's really big considering those effects are independent of one another.
---
How I like to think about rage management is: you always want to bounce between 20% (that's the minimum you need to cast your big dick move), and 85% (because the next thing you do that generates resource will most likely put you over your cap, and you won't be able to spend those points). **Never be too low, because you can't do anything during your windows, and never be too high because you'll never get those points back to spend on damage.** Basically, I'd invest like 6 auto attacks right out of the gate; you build rage to that min 20% (you're investing in your execute phase right out of the gate, or for a defensive cool down/ anything that you might need to react to), and you've help the tank stack a sunder armor or 2 (since sundering armor nets you rage if you 1:1 your sunders and autos).  Then start slamming in between auto attacks, and dump any excess rage that might over cap you via WW or HS or shouts if you get big dick damage.
---
I would consider something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/0230501133251-1505010502141). That brings your slam down to at 1.1 sec cast, which means you've got about 2 seconds of room to react to extra rage generation from crits/ WF procs (if you're horde)/ getting hit on if slam won't prevent you from becoming over capped on rage. As you get more stable with your windows, and you get a firm understanding of how your rage management works, I would move points from imp slam over to enrage; since that covers more options from being the victim of a crit. Ideally, in a raid you won't be taking damage,  you won't have a chance to get crit on in a raid so that's kinda a waited talent in that aspect. But it's valuable in pvp/ solo play. So once you figure out your slam windows and rage management, I would move the slam talents over to talents that help you elsewhere.
---
Also, if you're raiding, with this spec, your guild might not like it since your bleeds might take up some debuff slots.
---
Skeram is below 35% Alliance
---
Nothing wrong with that, but it's common courtesy to do other bosses the group might need. I'm not assuming you dont, that was just the context of my post. Personally I never mind running 20 runs for someone's bis as long as I got a chance to do the same.
---
Whilst it's a pain to wipe, there are times when I find the drunk or high guys amusing, so find I am a bit more forgiving because I'm also having a laugh.
---
That's what the game is about for me, having fun and a laugh, if it was all taken so serious all the time it wouldn't be fun and would be pointless playing. 
---
But it does depend on what the person is like, if they aren't chatty, aren't fun, and are just so out of it that it's mistake after mistake then I'd get fed up in the end and replace them. If they are chatty, doing something funny and giving me a laugh then I don't mind the mistakes or to wipe so much because I'm having a fun time regardless.
---
Yea, IRL it doesn't take me 35 minutes to complete. I'm done in like 4 minutes in my SM dungeon.
---
Clearly youve never played on private servers.  It is embarassing how bugged the version blizzard released is.
---
I understand your points which is why I left leeway in my post. "You guys may have systems in place". I understand dkp can have restrictions on things and you can give new players starting dkp and whatever. My guild allowed negative dkp which gave a chance to new players. It's still not new player friendly though and it still doesn't optimize the raid. It also opens up a lot of debate on the issue. Are you guys gonna allow hunters to get dft? It's good for them too but more of a side grade, and much better suited on a rogue or warrior. 
---
You're comment on still giving tanks prio on tank gear shows exactly how little you understand about the metas I was referring to. Tanks in good guilds are wearing almost 0 defense and defense gear means absolutely nothing. Out MT is wearing a mixture of mail and plate dps gear. Things like true flight bracers, onslaught girdle, Savage glad chest ect. You know why we do this? A tanks job is about positioning and controlling. What good is mitigation when you can unthreat cap your raid and kill bosses in 20 seconds? This is a larger benefit to the raid than a tank that can mitigate more damage. Healers use less Mana because fights end much faster. You out dps entire mechanics this way. For example I haven't seen a submerge phase on rag in years. We killed Rag week 2 and we still did not get a submerge phase even with a weak raid. Another example I havent seen Shaz blink yet either, we kill him before he does. This is the benefit of playing this way. 
---
So to your original point, no one is competing for tank gear, tanks are competing for dps gear. If they aren't you won't have the threat to break through the wall of clearing things quickly enough.
---
I know you think I'm some sort of elitist asshole. But really I'm just an adult who loves this game and doesn't have the time to fuck around spending hours clearing raids. Less time spent in a raid also equals a happier and healthier guild. I just want to reiterate that if you're having fun keep having fun man. Your guild works for you and that's great, I'm more just trying to give insight not deter you from dkp. 
---
You'll reflect on this conversation when all the content is out. You may not agree 100% but you'll see what I'm talking about.

I saw someone get upset about the caster staff in there. You're literally gonna get the Staff of Westfall in 5 minutes when you turn in quests. Chill

I mean. 2100 arena pvper vs somebody who doesnt know much pvp isn't too much of a challenge. In actually collecting an album on killing Olympus members
---
That's a proper retarded reply from the GM. "Just get your own colluding partners from the other faction". Why don't they allow us to  directly talk to the other faction if we are supposed to make deals with them then? It was bannable back in vanilla and it should be bannable in Classic.
---
Yeah people ninja'd all the time in vanilla WoW. Back then there were dedicated realm forums and ActiBlizzard wasn't actively banning people for blacklisting players publicly. Not much has changed. He got one piece of loot, but will probably never be able to raid ever again with a guild on this realm.
---
You limit yourself to not getting people that already have the item though. I don't know why people have issues with reserving.
---

I usually doze off in MC, then wake up when I hear someone screaming to start DPSing.
---
MC as a mage is 90% frostbolt, 10% decurse and that's it really... hard to stay awake through most of it.
---
&gt; occasional Overpowers and Hamstrings to fish for Sword Spec, HoJ 
---
if your raid will tolerate the hamstring debuff, i don't know why they wouldn't tolerate the mortal strike debuff.
---
What about the random group invites don't forget those
---
Let's say someone has an item that has an value of 7 and another has one that's 3.  A item with a value of 8 drops.  Giving it to the person who's current item is a 3 is better for overall raid dps than giving it to the person who currently has an item of value 7.
---
Also, spreading gear out is an insurance mechanism.  If all your gear is on one guy who can't show up, it's a huge loss to overall raid dps.  It also means that if anyone one person leaves the guild the total impact is reduced.  Which again, during the course of progression averages it to a total greater raid increase over that period of time.
---
i have 2000g and two 60s already, my rogue went by super fast because i gave him twinked out geared basically spent 300g-400g on him.  Got nothing else really to spend money on so why not for the increased leveling speed?
---
My point is it wont invalidate previous content. MC gear will still be the best we have until early next year when BWL comes out and even at that point the previous raids will still have value. Im sure blizzard has their reasons for getting DM out early but that does not mean they are rushing. Phase two will still be coming out at the same time and we don't even know the content release dates for the next two years, wait and see before you start worrying on reddit
---
Ret pally in my guild didn't stop using Ravager for aoe packs until after BRD.

Flasks aren't really needed in MC or Ony. They will be used more later on
