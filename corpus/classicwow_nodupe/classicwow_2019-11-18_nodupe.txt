Yes officer, this man right here
---
---
---
Alliance on benediction with the same macro
---
You do know servers have almost triple the amount of players on them as original servers right? And all the min maxing private server spergs roll horde which creates a crazy imbalance.
---
For the umpteenth time, spy does not "ping location" or whatever, it just tells you there's a dude around. If you can't see him, you can't know where he is.
---

---
Spy or not, if you have 1 hunter or druid in the raid, they'll ping you and steamroll you anyway. I seriously think spy makes no difference in this issue.
---
I don't think I'm missing any important factors. Think I've been through the most important ones. This simply isn't a way to maximise your gold income for the reasons I've explained. I don't think it's close, frankly.
---
It's not the best way to make gold, but there's reasons someone might want to outside of maximising gold. That's fine. Perhaps they enjoy that social aspect, perhaps they want to be part of the community, perhaps they don't enjoy dungeons.
---
Lock-picking is a different beast altogether. It's not comparable. Though it's more than possible you could make more just spending your off-time doing some pick-pocketing.
---
It won't change the complaining. The people who currently get farmed won't be invited to the good premades and will just get stomped, regardless of if they join a mediocre premade or play solo.
---
The only solution is to get good, and complainers never want to hear that.
---
Roll Horde.
---
Keep dreaming. bgs came 8 weeks after honour in vanilla. We'll get them before Xmas
---
This guy welps
---
I'll be honest and say I did not see coming;
---
1. The influence of private servers. To be frank, I was barely aware of their existence and size.
---
2. The extent to which people effectively already completed Classic on paper and for whom the phases really only serve to gate their progression.
---
3. Layering. I wasn't aware of the technology (quit retail years ago) and thus did not realize that resources intended to be limited were not so limited after all, ruining the economy and progression in the process. Ironically the people you cant avoid now were all too happy to dodge you using layers before.
---
4. Rampant abuse of exploits such as raid XP and lack of punishment.
---
5. The extent to which people hinge their enjoyment of the game on a virtual dick measuring contest rather than flavor and playstyle. Congratulations, you are Undead Mage #28943772.
---
6. The effects of streamer culture, social media and things like Discord, which quickly mobilize and centralize huge numbers of players.
---
So in turn I didn't think there would be this amount of people this early on, who have completed their virtual shopping lists and have nothing better to do than suck the joy out of World PVP, reducing it to a numbers game like they did everything else. 
---
If you saw this all coming the way that it did, then hats off to you.
---
Jesus you must really love the smell of your own farts
---
Im not sure, but that doesnt sound right. Id avoid them at alll costs
---
Let me guess your class...
---
Not to mention you'll get ganked while running to the dungeon anyway.
---
Since you didn’t think to look up the answer to my question and jumped to calling me « ridiculous », here’s a list of characters that don’t shoot:
---
Brigitte
---
Mercy
---
Moira
---
Reinhardt
---
However, that doesn’t take into account characters who don’t shoot, but do technically have a function to do so.
---
Baptiste (healer)
---
D.Va (off-tank)
---
Lucio (off-healer)
---
Mei (off-tank)
---
Orisa (main tank)
---
Sigma (tank)
---
Sombra (utility)
---
Symmetra (utility)
---
Winston (dive tank)
---
Wrecking ball (off-tank)
---
I’ll leave it at that and let you to compare that to the meta characters. IMO, if you’re getting worked up by someone else’s opinion, then you should care enough to look into their inquiry.
---
From the above argument, OW reflects very little of the shooter quality.
---
Is it my turn to call you ridiculous now?
---
Yes I fully realise that but it's perfectly legal inside the game which means Blizz feels it is shitty but LEGITIMATE behaviour within the rules of the game. 
---
Which is why they created another form of server where this behaviour is SPECIFICALLY DISALLOWED unless consented to for those players who don't want to deal with it.
---
Alright so I understand what I’m about to ask is dumb, but I’m a new player and I don’t know a lot yet so here it goes: what is the deal with this Phase 2 thing? I see a lot of people on here talking about it and how they’re worried about how it will affect leveling, general gameplay, etc. I’m a lvl 25 rogue on a PVP server. Should I be worried? Is it really going to make THAT much of a difference?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
[deleted]
---
It's funny because the more it goes and the less rational you are.  At this point I barely see any link between what you says and what I just said.
---
You are making connections that doesn't make any sense ... it's like if you were having a conversation of your own.
---
It's a resto shaman......
---
I can read. He only mentioned no hunter, I would assume that not everyone is aware that druids can do it as well.
---
Not accurate. People are complaining about how the PvP is broken on certain servers, like on Stalagg where it's 80/20 Horde majority and Heartseeker where it's the same for Alliance majority. With the higher population of each server and how groups act as force multipliers, this breaks the game. Blizzard perpetuated it by allowing free transfers right after the first census data came out.
---
Make faction-specific queues *and* faction-specific character creation. If a realm pop is more imbalanced than say, 55:45, then you cannot create a character of the faction with larger numbers, assuming you don't already have a character on that realm.
---
For example, if you play on Skeram and you're Horde, you can still make new Horde characters, but somebody without a character on that server couldn't make anything that wasn't Alliance.
---
Not gonna lie, if something someone said to you 6+ months ago stuck in your head for that long...I think you may need to take a step from Reddit lol.
---
Split honor from so many people tagging a player and diminishing returns from killing the same people over and over again
---
You try going through the back?
---
I don't mean to sound harsh, but what were you planning to do at 60 anyways if you can only play for 1-2 hours a day?
---
So why is it demonstrably different now? Look man, I don't see the point arguing with a brick wall that won't even acknowledge the truth.
---

---
This was not happening 12+ hours a day before. You are lying if you claim otherwise.
---
Gank squads are the problem, not guilds duking it out for shits and giggles, like the person you replied to said.
---
&gt;someone said to you 6+ months ago stuck in your head for that long.
---
I didn't remindme bot reminded me. Lol... Maybe you don't use reddit enough to know about it?
---
Thus the title "So I was reminded...."
---
56 Hunter same boat. Hopefully Blizzard blesses us with BGs sooner rather than later.
---
This is racist.
---
it definitely makes it more interesting, but the roving gank squads are not really that much fun. i was going to roll PvE, but my friends decided to go PvP...and of course all of them are not even playing anymore.
---
I already notice the effect you are describing.
---
"Ruin the economy"
---
*rolls eyes*
---
I would argue that it’s this simplistic view that created the issues that exist in retail. The fact that small-minded people like you think it’s only one thing (casuals) vs. another (hardcores?) that has created the toxicity that impacted what retail has become in all negative ways,
---
Anyone with any amount of sense or thought would recognize that there is a way to reward those who commit the most time and energy to the game while still making it accessible and fun for those that can’t, and that it is healthy for the longevity of the game to do just that. Has Blizzard missed the mark on this to date? In many ways, yes; but they would be far more foolish not to try at all.
---
You’re wasting your incredibly valuable time posting this nonsense, especially since Classic is much more centered around the haves than the have nots. Blizzard has stated time and again that they intend for this to be the case, so don’t waste your no-lifing on Reddit posting this garbage, it’s time you’re losing to get Rank 14!
---
Ignore seems to be account-wide in some cases. Not sure if it's DBM or one of the other few addons I have installed. On my main, I ignored a guildie's alt for being annoying (Didn't know it was him), and it caused him to not be able to message me on his main stating I was ignoring him. After screen capping my ignore list and us figuring it out over discord, I removed his alt and his main could message me. It was weird. 
---
Lesson: If you're trolling on an alt, that could get you ignored on your main too.
---
Same, I find this style of world PvP to be really boring. Although I guess there is going to be 100x as many premades as before and so bgs will also be shit.
---
Kind of. 
---
I think one thing we don’t consider is that this game will not bring in new players. I think it will only lose players over time. The lack of new blood will take away from the overall feel of vanilla world pvp.
---
However, this is not really interesting wpvp, and I think a lot of players are going to opt out of world pvp in 1-2 weeks. I am on Benediction, and despite what the internet says, the horde have at least a 3 to 1 numbers advantage when it comes to world pvp participation. I think a lot of these people will start getting very board when they see how little honor they are actually getting. It will probably become a more pleasurable experience as time progresses and people opt out of the hard core honor climb. Ultimately, the dominate side will have more internal competition. Hopefully that compensates the weaker side.
---
OR horde players could have some decency and not camp flight paths, not roam around in death squads murdering level 30s on sight who are just trying to quest. Pvp should not equal the majority corpse camping, vindictively slaughtering everyone on sight and generally being massive dicks.
---
Don't kill the opposite faction for shits and gigs - if they want to pvp and fight you then great, but fuck off while I'm trying to quest.
---
and you are free to play horde
---
"rose tinted" implies that vanilla was like this. PvP is fun, 24/7 zergfest is not.
---
i just wanna level my final 8 lvls..
---
Judging by OP's past comments I think it's safe to say he gets salty pretty easily :P
---
It shows you your coordinates not the enemy's.
---
I dont get the complaints. Usually tanks reserve stuff because thats the only reason they go there. If you dont like that join another group or make your own. This is their gold farm. 
---
Personally i dont join groups like that because i dont like it. But i dont complain about it since i can just make my own group.
---
Let classic run it’s natural course plz and thank you
---
You might run in to more players from the other faction interesting in PvPing where they might have passed you by before the honor system was implemented. It has made questing a little more difficult for me personally, but I'm Alliance and Horde is more numerous on most servers (unsure of how my own server is balanced though :P). But I've still been able to get by and it will probably just get calmer from here on out.
---
But you can't just play efficient all the time. Prayer of healing immedietly takes away a lot of pressure from the healers even when only healing 3 targets. You can spam heal whenever there is little to no pressure on the healers but as soon as there is a lot of incoming dmg, you better start using inefficient heals like flash heal and PoH to avoid deaths. Just don't be greedy with your consumables.
---
Doesn’t change the fact that horde vastly outnumber alliance.. I swear 90% of the people on this sub don’t have a brain
---
You do. The double jump is s slow and noone really does it. Even when jumping in the lava, you will not die from it. It will do like 30% of your health until you are in a safe spot.
---
Non lava jump means 2 jumps and a heal inbetween.
---
You can't raid mark enemy players.
---
If they chose to play on a pvp server and are now complaining on Reddit about then yes
---
I would gladly transfer to more reasonable server but they went out and locked the transfers to prevent the remaining few Alliance leave the shitties servers.
---
Ok thanks for the info!
---
Then you should shut up because you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
It's literal cancer to play on. You cannot farm mobs, fish or quest without being corpse camped. I logged on for an hour and got maximum five minutes of peaceful gameplay and the rest of it, 3 mages and a rogue were just relentlessly killing me and camping me for no reason.
---
I get it but corpse camping peaceful players is just cancerous and when it starts happening constantly it's not even remotely fun.
---
Currently have a 22 sub rogue.  I'm using daggers.  I have 5/5 points in MoD but I see a lot of builds on here without it.  Am I wasting points by speccing into it?  It seems to have a pretty significant impact on detection range, but on the other hand 20% extra damage to ambush seems pretty nice....I'm mostly looking to PvP
---
"When you're stuck and barred from half the fun of playing the game because of a couple of weeks of Honor Rush"
---
Not the smartest cookie, are ya?
---
I have 2 kids.  I can play a hour or so after my wife and kids go to bed.  If I were on a PVP server, I could be camped and it would derail my progress.   I can’t log out, take a break and log in later.  It’s either than small time slice or never. 
---
PVE is much easier to be casual.
---
They've said it countless times: It requires a software patch. 🙄
---
I used to main hunter back in the day and checked my minimap every 10 seconds purely because I was a solo player and wanted to not get ganked often, if this addon existed and everyone knew about it I wouldn't have been a hunter main, it's busted.
---
My plan was to possibly find an early morning guild on the west coast or even the east coast. Ony and MC don’t take to long, my current guild can clear Ony in under 45 minutes. I honestly didn’t have much of a plan, I just wanted to play the game again and enjoy the ride. So maybe I get to 60 and re roll a new class hehe
---
Yea, I definitely should have. I did PvE last time and figured I’d give PvP a shot this time around. It wasn’t so bad at first. It was much more organic. Mostly the occasional 1v1 and 60 rolls by and just steamrolls me. I don’t mind that. In fact it’s a lot of fun. Adds some suspense to the game. Will they attack? Will they pass by? Will they help? 
---
Now I can’t go five minutes without getting steamrolled by five 60s then corpse camped. Even players my level are more likely to attack than not. 
---
Then people are all ‘you rolled on a PvP server, that’s what you should have expected’ which I have a few issues with. 
---
-	I did expect and enjoy organic WPvP. I did not expect this because I had no frame of reference. 
---
-	Population densities are several times what they were back in vanilla. Which I also was unaware of. That massively changes everything about WPvP. 
---
-	The general player is vastly more informed and connected today which also drastically changes the dynamic. 
---
-	That’s victim blaming. Fucking stop. 
---
So now my only options are to transfer to another, hopefully better, server that is still PvP about which Blizz gives zero information on, reroll on a PvE server and toss away days of in-game time, or just quit entirely. So I did what research I could and transferred. Hopefully it will turn out better but I doubt it. If not I guess I’ll just stop playing and miss out of Rag for the second time because Blizz can’t manage to *not* royally fuck things up.
---
If I could pay to transfer to a PvE server I would in a heartbeat. Even if it was $100.
---
Game wasn't made for streamers. You give up your position which puts you at a disadvantage.
---
They have to use their influence to form a bigger group to defend them, but many don't and just complain about "stream sniping".. despite having everything in the game handed to them
---
Menethil has no guards ?? Dude I went there with a raid as a horde player, the moment we disembarked there were like 50 guards who spawned !
---
Honestly, Alliance need to wise up and skill up. My friends and I (alliance) have started avoiding big groups, travel to boats and flights together, and are having a wonderful time fighting back as a minority on the server.
---
I have over 46k honor so far, and have added many other competent players to my friends list. 
---
I will truly miss the end of the era that is raw, unfiltered world PvP madness. I think many are overreacting.
---
"Mob mentality" rofl.
---
Retail was created when Blizzard discovered that working people who play casualy actualy have and spend money as opposed to you basement dwelling neckbeards who barely scrape together a monthly sub then complain about everything.
---
Not catering to the 1% specificaly was Blizzard's greatest achievement.
---
Same
---
So much of my friends and guildies haven't played since honor system was implemented. We were only 30 people in MC today where the other weeks we had like 5 people on reserve. It's an absolute shit show for alliance and yes it totally destroys the game not only for us but for the Horde too.
---
The For the Horde stuff is good fun...but I agree with you, BGs would be awesome.
---
Finally a sane comment. I've seen minority faction groups (5-10) tear a zone up because they're actually prepared, communicating, carefully choose how and when to engage, and leave before things get dicey. Those complaining don't and/or wont take the time to prepare for PvP.
---
You can tell when someone ress's because their corpse changes to a skeleton, people have been using this to hunt for people who just ressed forever. The mage could have just /tar your name.
---
Anyone who cares enough about classic wow to be on this subreddit and making posts is taking it at least semi-seriously.
---
Bravo.
---
However, I’m still enjoying the game as 90% of the things people complain about here on Reddit I’ve still yet to experience.
---
So level 60's are ganking the shit out of people who aren't even worth honor....and your theory is they will stop when BG's are released? The only reason they are doing it is to piss you off. This really is how a PVP server works and how PVP servers have always worked. It doesn't matter if they changed up layering, or the patch timing, or the number of servers or anything.... people on PVP would still be doing shit just to piss you off. IF you don't want this then yes......YOU SHOULD HAVE ROLLED ON A PVE SERVER!
---
Had a mage in ZF that would only cast Blizzard, even on single target fights. The priest and I asked for mana drinks from him, and he never gave us anything, so I just stopped giving him Blessing of Wisdom lol
---
Queuing up from cities was implemented shortly after the release of BGs.
---
Think people rather want phase 2 fixed with things like faction queues, removal of the spy add-on etc, but realize it's not a realistic demand so go for something that is: BGs.
---
Might only be my personal experience, but as an Alliance on a horse dominated server the majority of my friends already threw in the towel and are just raid logging now(Just like Retail).
---
As long Blizzard sticks to Nochanges, I only see BGs fixing this.
---
.....flag yourself for pvp?
---
Honestly, it's not spy that's ruining the game. It's the incredible faction imbalance and having every FP camped by 10-15 of the opposite faction simply waiting for people to fly there and gank them, over and over again. World PvP was never this bad in Vanilla, and it's ruining the game for thousands of people.
---
2 handed is the way to go.
---
&gt;all I'm arguing here is that the problem exists whether or not server transfers are allowed.
---
Not a single person has ever debated this, people are upset Blizzard made it 10x worse.
---
Why i read this in preaches voice?
---
[removed]
---
Look at all the comments in this thread, a lot of people on the same boat on this
---
I don’t care if you are level 15 or 60 I will kill you and keep moving on. Ain’t war hell.
---
lol what? You are all "the internet" to me, one single entity with infinite heads, constantly contradicting each other, proving itself wrong and never agreeing on anything.  
---
The hydra has nothing on you man.
---
For endgame content, taking into account raiding, tanking is sort of iffy anyway. You can be a dungeon tank all you want, but if you want to be a "real" tank for raids the slots are very limited. Imo this slots warriors into a mediocre class for demand, because they are pretty common as a DPS.
---
Certain ranged DPS are missing from raids, at least on my server hunters and warlocks (some servers have too many hunters though). But they struggle to find 5 man content because DPS are plentiful and both boast fairly weak utility and mediocre dps in comparison.
---
Healers are by far the most reliably demanded class. Raids are almost always short, and grouping for 5 man is tolerable if not instant. Of the healers druids are always the least common, but that's in part because people are a bit gunshy healing dungeons without a spam rez and I feel it keeps healer players away from the class somewhat. Typically druids tank in dungeons and heal in raids. They are in massive demand because their gearing doesn't compete with anyone and they are rare as heck. Shamans would be the second most demanded healer, because their buffs only apply to 5 people at a time unlike paladins. Priests/Paladins are "the least demanded" (you don't *need* as many paladins as you do shamans ideally), but you'll find raid slots very easy to come by all the same because they're still healers.
---
You can do lashers on 52 ez, but exp isn't good like 1/6 of normal.
---
What server is this? I want to be murdered less.
---
&gt;fuck no changes 
---
You thought you did. But you didn't.
---
Trolls usually have to try hard to be this unlikable but you've managed it naturally...(dare I say, holistically, even?)
---
You WOULD download an anvil!
---
i'll never kill a kobold ever again
---
It's definitely a problem on servers were population has 3:1 ratios, and the minority continues to shrink.
---
Apart from the fact that hibernating takes months and should you choose to fall asleep you shouldn't wake up till the summer so kinda agree but then you would be functionless for the next 2.99 months
---
Raided with Duck if any old duck members out there :)
---
I expected people to be assholes, I just never imagined there being so many people crammed onto one realm.
---
Thats the big issue here, right along faction imbalance.
---
I've been RP replying to the comments here because I enjoy it. However, I gotta just say that WoW players can't use that definition of insanity. We do the same raids every week. We do the same quests on different characters over and over again. We farm the same bosses for mounts and transmog (on retail obviously). All of this to expect an item to drop, to have a "different result" from our mains, or just something different. We're all insane.
---
If it was "very simple", Blizzard would have done it already.
---
There's been a rolling PVP battle at southshore since honor launch on my PVE server...
---
Thanks! I'm proud of it.
---
PVE sucks cause you will never have real world PVP. Good luck getting honor before phase 3. And eventually the enjoyment of the game will die off and you will wish you has something like world PVP, the real lasting reason to play.
---
Edit: Also the people whining about PVP on reddit are wimps. It aint hard and it wont stop you from leveling 48-60
---
What if i told you there is world PVP on a PVE server as well?
---
What part of "that would break other addons" didn't you understand? Blizzard might have the resources to do it, but most addon creators don't have the resources to build their addon from the ground up again. If it was as simple as you describe it, they would've done it already. Trust me, I think Blizzard is scummy as fuck, but I sure as hell don't believe that they would choose to not complete a job that 1 person could do within a short timespan.
---
Considering how many subs classic brought back to the game, I think it’s safe to say they do care.
---
Whats the best way to get from revered to exalted with argent dawn?
---
Can you confirm it’s better then sticking with Ret spec?
---
My guild always had this joke, I was getting shadowmourn and the quest makes you kill 1000 undead in ICC to eat their souls to put into shadowmourn, and one guildy was like, what if you just killed 1000 kobolds instead. Be using shadowmourn and it whispers to you "You... No... Take... Candle..."
---
As a mage I strongly disagree. If something goes wrong I'm dead.
---
Oh shit bed time. ^(To look at reddit for another few hours.)
---
You re the moron.
---
&gt; fun and the experience
---
Yeah, of being killed by people 30 levels higher than you constantly. To each their own. I'll stick with PvE and if I ever need a PvP fix there are other games dedicated specifically to that, so less griefers.
---
This is why i don't understand when people say they rule out a pve server because they still want to pvp just on their own terms. That's exactly what PVE server offers.
---
Be bad, get mad
---
boats and ships were so important in wc2. i wish there were more in wow
---
People didn't like templates either though, because gear progression is a core part of WoW. People like the idea of balanced PvP, but its not what we play WoW for.
---
Its important for Blizzard to look at what people do more than what they say. My server has seen a massive spike in logins since honor was released. That suggests that world PvP is popular, but we will see if that continues.
---
What server are you on? That sounds so fun
---
Your honour is displayed in game, no assumptions necessary.
---
Tell me what BM and SV are good at
---
I was doing fighting a warrior today and left combat the second hamstring wore off so that is a factor.
---
So much crying and complaining between OP and this thread.  You're proving the "you think you do but you don't" as correct.
---
Y'all asked to relive Vanilla, so here it is.  Stop bitching.  That's how we got to the state of retail, Blizzard bending the knee to the complaints.
---
Since you're a newer player, I recommend you go Druid - you can easily try all the roles, and if you decide to tank, I find it's easier to start doing this in bear-form. Handling larger pulls can be tricky as a Warrior, while bear-form gives you various AoE-attacks that let you build threat on multiple targets.
---
The only caveat is that without these high populations end game would be terrible.  It's really nice with teh higher populations.  It still retains the community feel without dungeon finder,but there are enough doing all the various aspects of end game you can do it regularly.
---
I mean, this is super convenient for players willing to pay but on his end this seems super boring and a lot of work for little reward. 
---
Having that many accounts will cost a pretty penny IRL and even if he earns hundreds of gold a day, that doesn’t seem worth the time/rl money to me. 
---
I don’t know, maybe it’s just me but when I’m in IF I offer up my lock picking, enchanting and leather working but get bored after about 5 minutes. I can’t imagine doing this on multiple accounts and continually advertising.
---
Muh no changes
---
I literally just googled the first three famous PvPers from Vanilla I could think of and they all had their combat log displayed in their videos: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jr3iGnjuWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jr3iGnjuWo), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgV-FPWuWQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgV-FPWuWQk), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok)
---
Shitstomped, not bad. I prefer shitslammed
---
Level? Bgs? What sort of retail are you from?
---
I want the world pvp from vanilla where people wanted to have fun. I don't like the world pvp people are choosing to do on my server where it's all about efficiently farming HKs or alternatively sitting at a flight path with 20 others so you can one shot every level 30 that flies in.
---
Git gud
---
If we weren't getting cross realm BGs yeah. But we are. So no. BG queues are actually the biggest flaw in the plan, cross realm BGs will give ranking an even worse meta than pre 1.8 ranking as they will be popping around the clock, no dead hours.
---
I see your point.
---
&gt;I literally just googled the first three famous PvPers from Vanilla I  could think of and they all had their combat log displayed in their  videos: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jr3iGnjuWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jr3iGnjuWo), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgV-FPWuWQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgV-FPWuWQk), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok)
---
Seems boring tbh
---
What level are you in? It doesnt seem that extreme for me? I did 56-58 over 1.5 days this weekend, yea there was ganking squads and corpse camping, but its not entirely impossible to find a spot without too much of it.
---
I have a couple hundred hours in Overwatch, played last 40 minutes ago. I don't need to look anything up. 
---
First of all, there are two characters in the entire game that don't shoot. Rein and Brig, and they both have a ranged attack. Characters in OW shoot. The existence of roles does not negate the fact that they do, in fact, shoot. Rainbow 6 has roles, as well- I'm guessing that's not an FPS either? Paladins? TF? Do you have any idea how many games have classes/ roles at this point? 
---
Mercy has pretty crazy DPS with her little gun and Baptiste is an improved Soldier 76 in his current state. [D.Va](https://D.Va) shoots, Lucio shoots, Mei shoots, Orisa shoots, Sombra shoots, Symmetra shoots, Winston shoots, Ball shoots. I don't feel like listing all the heroes currently in-game, so let's do it this way: \[Name\] shoots. 
---
Characters don't need to be tooting and shooting revolvers all the time for it to be an FPS. Far Cry is an FPS and I spent 80% of that game killing shit with a shovel. Half-life is an FPS but you spend the game alternating between lasers and a big-ass wrench thingy. 
---
Wikipedia: A first person shooter is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a [f](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_(video_games))irst-person perspective. 
---
Overwatch has an array of characters which use a variety of weapons to engage in combat from a first-person perspective.
---
It's an FPS by definition.
---
So yeah. I didn't just jump to calling you ridiculous, I'm calling you that because right now, you're being it. You can dislike Overwatch and that's 100% fine, but coming out and saying that a game where you play from a first-person perspective and shoot/fight other players not an FPS is ridiculous.
---
That sounds insane, I'm gonna check that out. Big queue on Herod though.
---
However, that really doesn't sound like a population imbalance issue at all, the very same thing could be done in Undercity or Orgrimmar - the port in locations for those cities where you are most likely to catch people still flagged for pvp are somewhat remote, especially in Orgrimmar.
---
But yeah just checked on Whitemane, two 60 rogues in Ironforge and we don't have a 70/30 pop split here.  
---
update: The same thing does happen in Orgrimmar for us.
---
I don't think you even understand what he meant.
---
When i'm starting to level in a new zone I hit Ctrl F on the pet skills website on Petopia and see what's available in that zone.
---
acting smug about having the watered-down babies experience is pretty funny.  
---
nobody likes getting ganked by 60s, but running across a similarly leveled opponent in the open and fighting them is pretty fun and lets you actually test your skill against another human.   
---
at some point you're gonna get tired of fighting dumbass AI and want a challenge
---
Your guild is literal shit if shadow is competitive. Because it isnt. Shadow is a top 6 spec, which is about 60% less dps than the top 3.
---
&gt; But, if I am already stealthed and walk in range of an enemy player, will it notify them that I am in the area? And does this change if I have buffs that somehow also trigger spy?
---
No, if you are stealthed outside of the range of actions the combat lag picks up it will not notify spy UNLESS you are visibly seen in stealth by the person with spy. Same with actions you take while inside stealth IE if you cold blood while in stealth and spy did not pick you up before it will not pick you up if you use the ability.
---
people will level thru BGs if it keeps them away from any and all assholes out in the world,pretty sure BG leveling has been around since vanilla,the exp just wasnt as good. but my point is still made,if u can avoid being caught out in the world they will do it.
---
it beats outright quitting,which would be their next option and the one they would 90% take.
---
I've been leveling alts on a popular PvP server without a problem.  Not sure what all the crying is about.
---
Haha right?! My guild is great and the leaders are really nice and most of us have jobs and families. But godamn our runs take forever. Multiple wipes and days to try and clear MC.
---
I just hit Badlands and am going to grind a level or two on the dragons, and skin all of them. What I get I will sell and move on to the next spot. If I get lucky, yay.
---
Dungeons can get boring. Tanking dungeons can get boring real quick.
---
The only reason my bro puts up with it is that we usually reserve some drops.
---
Exactly. Whitemane is a joke. All those "hardcore pvpers" that wanted open world pvp are AoE farming in southshore or sitting at flight paths with 20 friends. That isn't the world pvp I joined for and its not what I enjoyed from vanilla.
---
The players are the problem.
---
You aren't saying anything new or insightful by going "hurr durr you should have seen the future and rolled on a PvP server". Just being a dick that tries to stifle discussion whilst showing zero empathy.
---
Yeah, they definitely are about their subscriber count, but I doubt they give two shits about whether it comes from classic or retail.
---
Totally agree. How do we take it out? Post on Blizz forums? Report in game?
---
I have never related to a post this much. I am a 53 orc warrior and it is chaos in all of the leveling zones for our level. I just sit in Org and wait to find a dungeon group.
---
stop being toxic
---
At least in WSG or AB it's 10v10 and balanced in numbers. Currently, the discrepancy is so out of balance on most realms, it's just painful being on the losing side. On my server, there are horde at _every_ FP in any zone 50+. It's mind blowing that these people just camp a FP for hours on end waiting for people to land and corpse camp them.
---
The real question is has it reached WoW forums levels of toxicity yet.
---
That kind of filth is on the soul, there's no washing that
---
this game probably isnt for you
---
Yeah this guy is a fucking loon
---
Not before phase 3
---
Well, maybe reddit isn't the place to complain but Blizzard really dropped the ball on this one. I was on a nicely split server, then they offered free transfers and half the alliance left. Then they did it again. Then they made it horde only transfers after the damage was done. Now it's roughly 80/20 and barely playable.
---
I think this is true for me too, but I’m not on a faction that’s outnumbered.
---
I just like that it no longer feels safe to just go out farming. It was never completely safe but it now feels downright hazardous to go to some zones.
---
My server has had massive queues since WPvP was released. I wish more people did that on my server.
---
Good luck getting to dungeons especially BRD
---
Leveling and PvP.
---
I don't think you used this meme correctly.
---
So my druid is parked for another months at level 53ish unless maybe I can somehow get to dungeon grind my way to 60. Else than that there is no zone for me as Alliance on Shazzrah to level at least at a reasonable rate. It's not pvp, it's a shitshow with Spy addon. 60s running around every goddamn zone sniping people. I kill one or two mob and then suddenly a few 60s appear. Tried every zone. It's non-stop corpse run until you decide it's not worth the hassle and alt-f4 out of the game.
---
Is your hearth in the Shimmering Flats because you are so full of salt I’m worried for your health!
---
Got a question regarding levelling. I bought my mount, got tribal leatherworking done and don't really feel the need to grind gold for now. I'm level 42 and looking to blast my way to 50 so I can hit the crater. Problem is, the zones aren't looking great for my level. STV is probably my best option, but Alliance raids are pretty common there right now on my server. Tenaris isn't any better. Hinterlands doesn't really have any quests and the mobs are a bit high, despite Hunter's being able to kill them with a pet. Dustwallow is probably my best questing option since STV is hot from phase 2.
---
Where do you suggest I spend my time and would I be better off just mob grinding rather than trying to find a zone with quests around my level?
---
But it's not fun if it's a fair fight... They need their 5 to 1 ratio :)
---
You know what saved time..... the LFG feature that instant grouped and sent u on ur way. No way that'd be negative in classic huh? Just saving time :)
---
Why did they make these zones ? Maps filled with mobs, loot, and details otherwise. They are made to be traveled through and upon, made to be suffered in and progressed. These zones are being skipped completely. But in classic u need a warlock or u can't summon. Want a door opened ? Get a key or bring a rogue ? Wanna travel long range quick get a mage. Classea. Have. Utility. 
---
If running to a dungeon is too much time taken then this is NOT the game for you.
---
Far less likely to happen still, and would almost never be anywhere close to a fair fight because you can’t force people around you to flag. So why would anyone flag other than to stomp someone else who is flagged.
---
Is there really any thrill involved in being stomped 8 vs 1? I just take my beating and move on, but I don't feel any challenge at all, nothing I could have done to change the outcome. Unless you consider playing Anne Frank hiding simulator a thrill.
---
Actually I did some other censuses and pyrewood village started to have queue, so probably I counted the server cap. It seems 6500-7000. Maybe blizz increased it or is it different per server or I did not count it correctly last time.
---
Exactly. All the people acting like anyone who didn't have a crystal ball and foresee this perfect is stupid, are fucking assholes that are just desperate to try and make themselves feel superior.
---
&gt;I am sure there were addons that spotted people near you.
---
No.  There wasn't.  I like how you aren't even sure and don't even know.
---
I play on Arugal, highest pop Aussie server, with a Horde dominance.
---
I'm levelling as a NE druid, and while the gank is real, I am still able to avoid most of it.
---
Maybe it's just me? Idk. It's definitely not as bad as people here are making it out to be.
---
He wasn't defending, he was explaining, very matter of fact. Good information that I personally didn't know.
---
So what you are saying is that they are getting the authentic Vanilla experience.
---
As a warlock who's not tried Ony, ima guess it's due to our mad threat reset mechanic.
---
So while Blizzard is busy sitting on their hands, do you want a workaround or do you just want to bitch more?
---
sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server, start a new character on a PvE server or quit
---
Then release bg.
---
So not Vanilla.  Got it.
---
If it sucks so much, why are queues so long?
---
People can't seem to get enough of phase 2 on my server.
---
&lt;APES&gt; is a PvP guild
---
Yes.  I was Rank 14 Shadow Priest.  I began my run before BGs were out.  I know 100% that didn't exist.
---
I'm also worried that the vocal minority here will influence Blizzard.
---
Phase 2 is everything I've expected and hoped for.
---
wait a second... give the summoning away for FREE
---
but then gank the person arriving
---
this plan is foolproof! rank 14 world first
---
Buffing alliance racials would help.  Offer racial transfers to alliance.
---
Oh no! Not a software patch!!!
---
&gt;Totally doable for average bro with a job, wife and 2 kids :eye roll:
---
You're wasting time you could be scouting for lotus writing this my man!
---
It's the same for level 60. I tried to go halfway across felwood and died 15 times. Finally got into jaedenar for my mount quest. Tried to go to burning steppes, dead within 5 seconds of landing. Died at least 10 more times. Finally flew out to red ridge and ran to burning steppes. Died twice at the zone line then finally made it to the quest dude in the west.
---
Tried to do LBRS with a buddy. I knew Morgan's was off limits so I went to thorium point. WAY worse. It took an hour to get to Blackrock spire. Died probably 20 times. In the span of 4 hours I went into jaedenar, turned in a quest in burning steppes, and went to LBRS. The game is quite nearly unplayable 40+ as alliance on whitemane.
---
That’s rough, lol.
---
The solution is to go play on a pve server.
---
I'd recommend rolling on my server, arcanite Reaper, it's a lot more like vanilla since pop is low.
---
Same, I'm currently suffering major regrets after levelling a warlock to 40 on a PVP server. I can only play some evenings so getting murdered every 5 mins kind of ruins the 2 hours of fun I have to spare
---
They wanted what they thought it was like in 2005. It wasnt like that then and its worse now.
---
Even in TBC there was a lot of total BS pvp, including 15v7 bgs on the regular that were just shit stomps.
---
Wow finally! I was starting to think I was the only one with those memories of Vanilla! THAT was the true Vanilla experience. 
---
I think Blizzard messed up by making servers 2-3 times the size of Vanilla servers. They are too many players on at a given time. Layers helped, but also brought complications. I spend so much time running around doing quests simply waiting for respawns because too many people are doing the same quests. 
---
I wonder how they’re going to handle this.
---
the only thing wrong with phase 2 is shitty servers.
---
Fuck #nochanges. The server population goes against that anyway. Change things up Blizzard.
---
PM me, been playing for 15 years
---
Horde is outnumbered 3:1 on Zandalar, when I expressed my concern and said my guild is transferring I got alliance people saying stuff like "breaking under the pressure" and shit.
---
Have fun fighting nobody once it's all alliance...
---
You're not an honor target for 60's until you're 48.
---
Disagree, it evens out after about level 30 and you can take on 2-3 mobs at a time with relative easy and little downtime if you keep first aid up. Not as fast as a mage, but very manageable.  
---
  
---
It seems warriors also have the added bonus of getting ganked less in my experience. It seems people don't always want to risk fighting a warrior with a decent looking weapon compared to my druid friend who was picked on all the time.
---
Nor is he playing a priest. Probably on hunter or warloc
---
Why not just do dungeons then?  Don’t get me wrong it is a shitshow out there and they 100% should have implemented bgs along with honour system. 
---
But it’s not like you have to quest to level...
---
No one’s complaining about pvp. Absolutely no one. If you think that’s what the complaints are about, you either aren’t paying attention, or are literally too unintelligent to process basic information, either way, stfu.
---
You mean TBC before BWL
---
Anyone else 3 months in realise what a timedump and waste this is? Besides the fact that its sometimes very fun  you gain nothing at all in actual real life while you depending on how much/often you play can lose alot.
---
Its pretty depressing, after playing for 10 hours straight ill still think about it and browse forums.
---
Can confirm that all people defending this have the advantage I do not even really play classic anymore not because of pvp (I did play on a pvp server where my faction was outnumbered though) I just remember vanilla wow being unforgiving and unfair at times and at the end of the day if thats the way they want to make the game because thats how it was then you have the right to complain about it or if you dont agee dont support it then.
---
How do you all determine the price on something rare to the AH. I run TSM and have yet to get it scanned-- Deat's Head Vestment to be exact. Normally I can use TSM or google, or if it was retail- Undermine journal but with classic, cant find a baseline price to start at.
---
Usually STV for questing
---
Me too it is bugging me.
---
For real, what kind of braindead idiot looked at the pvp server and thought "I should be fine"
---
Could roll an alt in the meantime. I'm glad I picked a PvE server on my SPriest main, I'm level 40 and I'll happily sit flagged for PvP because I know roaming death squads won't be a thing. I'll take all comers.
---
Yea agreed on the PvE server transfer option though that might clear out way too many people ha. What about you only get honor from other 60s if you are 60? That should reduce the ganking though some people are just "red is dead" no matter what.
---
Yea yesterday was in that SS siege, so much fun ha. I'm a warrior and love the strategy involved in edging at the flanks and waiting for the right moment.
---
Dude seriously... Like...turn down Netflix when you play wow and you can hear the sounds of what people do near you. Yes that stuff that is in your combat log mostly also makes sounds.
---
I don't use that Addon but some people just complain to fucking complain
---
lmaoo
---
Sorry but that site is gonna never be close at all. On my server there should be a population of 1750... and I believe to 10000% that thats not true at all.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I mean Look at faerlina, probably the server with the most players out here ,cause streamer and fanbase and the server has only **4384** players on it? I highly Doubt that. WHen I watch highligt videos on YT and someone from faerlina is on there, that cant be true at all!!
---
How would that be a solution? That would just make the A:H ratio even worse on PvP servers
---
Grats! Wishing I had bought Thunderhorn (US) back in the day.
---
master looter can be assigned to anyone? awesome. thank you
---
I rolled on a pvp server because all full servers were pvp and I wanted to play on a big server. It was actually ok up until this phase released. Now I regret not rolling pve so much.
---
no, my point is that griefers will grief wether or not the BGs are out.
---
BGs being out will not stop the griefing.
---
**Raid times:**
---
Saturday 8PM EST (Friday and Saturday when necessary for later phases.)
---
Clearing MC and Ony in ~2 hours.
---
**About us:**
---
Previously &lt;vodka&gt; of Mannoroth, Alterac Mountains, and Stormrage.
---
Actively raiding on Zul'Jin on retail. Looking to add more quality players to our classic roster.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Healers. Druid and Paladin priority.
---
Any exceptional DPS.
---
**Preferred applicant:**
---
Players who enjoy playing classic wow at a high level. The ideal candidate will be one that is actively doing relevant content in the game outside of our raid schedule with other guild members.
---
**Loot rules:**
---
Officer council. Loot goes to players who are the most dedicated while also having a good attitude. Being active outside of raid time and participating in guild activities like PVP helps.

Phase 2 PvP takes more skill than arena has in years.
---
You can sit wuth pvp flagged to, odds are that anyone that wants to fight you will be alone because people wont be geouping up to world pvp outside of tarren mill/southshoore
---
What you want is a PvE-realm. There's no shame in this - you apparently don't enjoy playing on a PvP-realm, so just switch over.
---
it becomes less of a thrill and more of a hassle when its this constant.
---
My buddy told me he got 400 honor and only has ~10 kills. I have 300 and have it showing 0 honor points. Not sure why
---
This is the correct take. The whiny mob aka people who use this subreddit unironically are exactly the type of players catered too which created retail. Get better and stop whining
---
Ironforge for alliance.
---
But he said he wants the thrill of being murdered at any given moment, being flagged does that. You'll be attacked while not prepared.
---
If you want a fair fight you flag yourself and /chicken people and if they are keen they fight you fairly. That's what tends to happen.
---
Probably autoloot addon.
---
I definitely agree.  I played Legion, and liked how I could login, use looking for raid, find a group in 5 minutes, and do one wing.  I completely see the appeal of retail.
---
Not even that. It just tells you that 
---
'notbraincomplaints247 is casting Demonic Shield's
---
Cause that is what you see in your combat log
---
Oh no, I can't participate in one sided fights with no challenge. I'll be crying in a corner will all my consumes that you have to deal with when we get matched in BGs togher, where real ranking happens.
---
And every step to fix each exception brings us closer back to the current spy. 20 yards is insane? Are we not going to see cast bars then as well for people actually casting at us? What about the healer from the other side, should I not know where my enemy is getting healed from?
---
lol they do say go ham but even they dont really call it at the right times. trying to find another way of knowing
---
I can season my chips with the amount of salt in this thread
---
Bad look
---
Yup - people on this sub were crying about the original phase plan of having bgs and honour come out at the same time.
---
People who actually remember vanilla and have been playing pservers for the last few years knew that honour system without bgs was going to cause large numbers of people to quit.
---
Hmm. And here I've been pitying folk on PvE servers imagining they must be bored as hell.
---
Bind mousewheel scroll up or down to Interact with Mouseover it’s a lot faster than clicking
---
To me that speaks much more to the community these days sure we are all adults and have shit to do so the more casual things are nice but all your friends giving up and raid logging says much more about them than the state of the game this was always how the game was people just felt more invested into their char and community because there was a huge time gap between release and PvP if you don't like it don't play but because "all your friends have thrown in the towell" blizz should be making this retail?
---
I want a pvp server with its true vanilla server player max capacity. Thought i had one. :(
---
I did a combination of STV, Feralas, hinterlands, Dustwallow, and Tanaris from 40ish- 50ish just do ZF when you can and quest in zones that aren’t a war zone if possible. There is more quests in hinterlands at higher lvl 40s so I’d suggest go there last. But dustwallow if no one is doing raids there is pretty chill and you can grind there pretty effectively just killing mobs. The Murlocs in dustwallow are a good lvl or two worth of grinding. You see a lot of your faction in a zone chances are you can get some quests done before the power shifts back over. Edit: murlocs not Murdock’s
---
The core part of my guild is like 80% NE. If we wipe, it makes it so much better running back to the instance. 
---
But of course, we usually wind up waiting for at least one stubby legged dwarf or gnome.
---
Too many wowhead commenters were stupid enough to believe that a shitty explanation of some rock you can see in the distance = all needed info
---
Rushed? It is dragging imo
---
A ton of players have all of the bosses in farm and full raid gear
---
Yea it’s crappy both ways. Imbalance doesn’t really make it fun in any way to me. 
---
It’s like an easy mode when you’ve got a huge advantage. It’s easier to farm and make money. It’s easier to find groups for anything. And of course it’s far easier to stay alive. 
---
Is what it is at this point.
---
this game isnt for you
---
Woah I remember seeing this portal I’m Michelle.
---
I was like did they port out LOL
---
You do realise not everyone have been playing since the begining right?
---
Thanks
---
Did like 2-3 hours of Tarren Mill vs Southshore brawlfest and i've had my fill till Phase 3
---
This. They fucked the launch up badly by using 1.12 and phasing. The early leveling experience was not balanced for 1.12, you only need to look as far as the AoE dungeon farming groups. 1.12 Itemization also makes everything easier than it was before then. 1.12 Talents make all endgame things much easier. Warriors alone have a much easier time tanking in 1.12, before 1.11 they had to make a choice on TPS vs Survivability. The shield bash change makes raid bosses so much easier as DPS can start faster and dps harder and the tank doesn't sacrifice anything for it.
---
Truly sad that Classic released in a massively different state and they still won't make changes because "that wouldn't be classic!". It's not the same experience, massively different than retail but no where close to what Vanilla was.
---
world pvp without ganking? rEaL pVp Is 10 vs 1
---
5 warlock multiboxer here, can confirm, does blow up.
---
Skeram Horde
---
Can confirm, coords all you need.
---
right but are hot babes irl
---
Lmao stupid comment Pretty sure you can't hear drinking from 80m away
---
 [me, also being on a PVE server and reading this post.](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/5wWf7GW1AzV6pF3MaVW/giphy.gif)
---
So that's why none of my fishing poles are selling. I'm glad I finished up over there a while ago.
---
How long till the post titled: Can we just acknowledge that all the tryhards who camped the minority faction right off the server are just regretting killing their server pop now that here is no one to do the AQ opening quests?
---
Literally prepped myself for this. Was holding off on other games until phase 2 hit. I haven't logged on once since it has. I'm hoping to give it a month or two to die down then come back. I rolled RP/PVP aka grobbulus for the player interactions. Not to get smashed into dust just trying to level. I do not look forward to going back.
---
I’m on a PvP server and I echo that guy’s thoughts. I still don’t understand help.
---
Yeah I was considering a PvP server, but knowing that world pvp isn’t that great for honor, and predicting this exact scenario of getting camped all day, I chose PVE.
---
It’s cool running to BRM without dying (unless I fall down the chasm in searing gorge because I’m looking at atlas loot)
---
Karazhan crypts
---
&gt; Oh yeah I'm sure people love being corpse camped by groups of 20 for an hour plus.
---
Yup, because they do something about it instead of just complaining on forums. 
---
&gt;Its more like PPPPPPPPPPPPPvP
---
It's still PvP.
---
You can try to categorize it in a special way that fits your narrative, but at the end it's player versus player action the way the game has allowed since 2004.
---
&gt;I most definitely want to pvp I just want some semblance of balance to it.
---
Then wait for Battlegrounds or roll a PvE server and only flag when you feel its safe for you to enjoy PvP.
---
I don't care about balance, sometimes I want to be the underdog and take on 2:1, 5:1 or 10:1 odds. Sometimes I want to zerg through areas and crush every horde in sight.
---
It's all PvP at the end of the day, and if you don't enjoy it then PvP servers might not be the place for you.
---
No they'll just actually use the free server transfers that they have no incentive to use right now.
---
ah good ol laggerspine!
---
Pool of upside-down sinners! Karazhan!
---
If you didn't get to 60, gear up to BiS everything, and join a huge, active guild before last week...
---
YOU ARE FUCKED.
---
Might as well not even log in until battlegrounds to live.
---
Leveled a Warrior- it’s a whole different ballgame out there now.
---
I used to be able to go out and just do careful pulls... now it doesn’t matter how careful I am, if I’m solo SMOrc is always there to take my head off.
---
On the one hand it totally sucks, but on the other hand it adds a totally different game element that has been missing from the games I’ve played since vanilla.
---
Yeah, and now we even have two versions of the game: one for the neckbeards and one for limited time investment daddy gamers. Isn't that the best thing that could happen?
---
All of them are.
---
and this is why you dolts have a bad rep.
---
The price should be the lowest price the seller will accept and the highest price the buyer will pay.
---
As a mage you can typically start casting as soon as the boss is pulled if not prior, especially in MC where everything is tauntable.
---
But I would heavily advice against blowing CD's that early. Wait until 5 winterchill stacks before blowing it to both improve dps and to let tanks get some time to aggro.
---
No, because the main crying is by people trying to do pve content (leveling or whatever) and it being basically impossible because the only efficient way to rank is to run around killing people in groups of 5-10.
---
These groups will go form premades and go do bgs once bgs come out.  This removes these hazards from the world for the most part.  Sure there will be those who complain when they keep getting rolled by premades.  However those people have elected to join a bg and are not being prevented from doing pve - which is a rather different thing.
---
i feel that. do you have DBM? that can provide a little aid on certain fights in my little experience as well... and maybe some research on specific bosses? generally i’ll wait for two sunders and follow dbm/prior fight knowledge like for rag it’s just a dps fest as ranged
---
Hm what is more likely, the person diligently watching the corpse and spamming /tar or using the addon that half the population is using.
---
Yeah I remember the imbalanced bgs, and I also played alliance in tbc.. in a horde dominant battlegroup.
---
It was dogshit, we would only win AV and sometimes we would even lose some
---
In my experience I’ve had to die 10+ times on my way to a guild run of mc because I had to be late. Enemy faction literally set up a wall and camped in a huge circle spamming frost novas around me.
---
Next time I’m bringing a stack of free action potions
---
Finally someone that makes sense
---
If it's on the top posts of the sub (And has been for DAYS), then you don't need to look up previous posts or anything if you take two seconds to look at the front page of /r/classicwow.
---
It's just as bad as the "ARE THE SERVERS DOWN" threads when there's a sticky or top post about servers being down.
---
Hi again! I'm glad you remembered the thread.
---
It is true that rewards are reduced as a non-herbalist, so you should not do Morrowgrain research. I'm an herbalist and I don't even bother with it. It's not an easy way to get rep, and the bag space you sacrifice is not worth the meagre profits... unless you find it fun (since it's kinda gambling?)
---
Revered to Exalted takes 8,400 Runecloth (420 stacks); 500-600g on most servers. Plus the chore of spamming trade chat. I'd personally avoid buying two epic mounts, but that's really up to you and the quality of life upgrade you personally get from having it sooner. Also consider if an epic mount ASAP helps you farm gold faster in the long run.
---
Thats really weird. Do you use any addons?
---
I'm surprised, would be a hell of a lot cheaper to just create multiple bank alts with 14 slot bags.
---
mad
---
There is a camp of night elf ghost people don’t mess with much, and if you can solo them the elite sithlid.  Or just wander around the middle part a little. Avoid the sides cause of miners for thorium.
---
Think u were looking for the retail sub
---
Back in ICC, there was an addon that would draw where things were going to happen on the ground for you by calculating the camera distance/angle and drawing 3D shapes in the world for you.
---
You didn't even look at the bosses in some fights, you just looked and went where it told you to go, and you would do it perfectly every time.
---
One of the big zombie bosses before the scientist guy, he drops poison and you have to run out. The addon let you just move slightly because it would outline the tiny spots that are safe.
---
**Addons can break the game. This is true. It's happened before and it'll happen again. It's Blizzard's responsibility to treat these addons as unintended and fix them.**
---
I’m assuming you’re:
---
60 already
---
Playing a char with stealth
---
If they open on you, even if you kill them first, 90% of the time you still die. Just stay alert and try to always get the opener.
---
And we all said 20 yards is far to small, if I can see it happening the combat log should reflect that. Why would we only have visual information?
---
Hell yea I’m originally from Dspine. We’re you horde or ally? I played a nelf hunter in &lt;Archaic&gt;
---
I miss the first Guild Wars so much.  It let you create max level characters with top gear that could only be used in PvP so everyone in the match was on an equal footing.  It was just *fun*.
---
I wonder if they've ever done one of those...
---
But that was not a fucking secret. Everyone knew the servers are bigger. Everyone with a bit of common Sense knew horde would be more popular and everyone knew blizzard would act to late on it
---
Not to be one of those nerds, but it only illustrates your point further. The alchemy transmutes for Arcanite Bar are actually 48 hours, not 24 hours.
---
All the literally unplayable posts, just translates to blizzard that they want more retail, where none of those problems happen.
---
As a rogue start your own dungeon groups and you will be just fine...and sounds like you need to find another guild.
---
👍 see you out there
---
Sad thing: it doesn't get any different at lvl 60
---
SV is trash in pvp. And...fine. I guess BM is better for lvling but that s not enough for a spec. That s all it s good at.
---
I've already mentioned this elsewhere - create a second combat log for player activity and restrict its access. This would give complete control over what can and can't be seen by players and by what. The game client can have more access than addons which means what you can actually see with your eyes would be greater than what an addon would scan for and tell you about.
---
There are solutions to this problem, anybody saying there isn't hasn't thought about it enough.
---
They hope if they make enough of them Blizz won't release the BG's early so they can just keep seal clubbing the minority faction on their server and calling it "PVP"
---
you fail to understand that with such large faction imbalance that sitting in a queue for 45 mins, between games, getting zero honor is actually less efficient than camping a choke point??  BG honor still suffers from diminishing returns so long games are also not that efficient.  If you play on the underdog faction, you are correct farming WSG is faster but if you on a realm with a 70/30 split its not as simple as you may think even with cross realm queue because ALMOST every realm is horde heavy.
---
Okay lowbie
---
Also just a lot higher percentage PvPing because the players have already min-maxed the content and understand the honor system in-depth.
---
Then go somewhere else, if your outnumbered and have no chance of winning and don't want to get farmed, why would you be there? You zoomers have 10iq.
---
I’m not a programmer but... wasn’t the game finished like 15 years ago? What work is there to do?
---
&gt;That’s victim blaming. Fucking stop. 
---
There are hundreds of thousands of people playing on PvP servers just fine. Take responsibility for your actions.
---
I am a Tank warrior without a PvP twink on a pvp server. I gave up on going out of IF because all I get out there is constant death. Interestingly enough, phase 2 made me log on less than before.
---
I rolled pve initially because I have never thought wow pvp looked that interesting, but was convinced by 3 other people I met through league to roll pvp with them. Now, here I am about to start raiding on that pvp server and they have all quit before reaching even 40. Now I feel screwed over as someone who wants to play solo in the world because there is nothing I can do when a group of 5-10 jump me on epic mounts. All I can do is hope my faction has a larger death squad in the area so I can farm in peace.
---
&gt;don't be a pussy and start going 10v1
---
hmmmm
---
I think whiney reddit posts are ruining things too
---
You want to PVP on your own terms,  when you want to... thats sounds exactly like you want to play on a PVE server.
---
You love the idea of PVP, but the reality is people like to win, so will generally only engage when they think they have the upper hand
---
Nope. You clearly don't know how brackets work and how it can be manipulated.
---
LOL
---
What a great response. You really got me there.
---
Hell yeah Blood and Thunder baby nipseyhussle!
---
The ranking system in classic sucks. There, I said it
---
Totally correct, average just has that zing to it
---
ITS LIKE RAAAAEEEAAAAAIIIINNNN
---
and in a BG you have a finite number of players so HK diminishing returns kick in faster, with a FP or choke point you have a constantly changing target so getting full honor from each kill.
---
Why are you assuming that the numbers are constant when they aren't?
---
1) gathering greater forces by seeking help from others in the area or on your friends list/guild
---
2) attacking stragglers and roamers in the larger group and then running away
---
3) hiding out in the zone among hills, trees, etc. and waiting for non-ganking horde to try and quest. You kill them, then move - the gank squad will come there because the guy you killed will whine in /1. Eventually you wear them out moving around the place without getting honor.
---
4) move to a different zone, and periodically pm people who are still there asking how the situation is - eventually it will clear up and you can return
---
These all work - I know because I use these strategies (I play alliance warrior, the worst possible pvp you can have). I was 50 when this phase started.
---
Horde 5 man gank squads corpse camping paths to every dungeon has been an issue since honor release on grobb in my experience
---
Yeah our Guild Leader, a warrior, was constantly forming UBRS spam runs for his shoulders. Of course everytime he did, the 6 other rogues in the guilds would sign up as they struggled with groups too. Eventually the guild master said "seeing a lot of the same faces signing up for UBRS, please go and make your own groups instead of relying on the guild all the time".
---
This is sadly how most people who play PvP games are. Toxic af.
---
Messages like this really show that you have a horrible price on your time, or you’re just being emotional and are lashing out. 
---
Telling a player to reroll his 300+ hour character and saying “you don’t need to pay anything”... 
---
I mean we both know it’s the second one.
---
Because only tanks/healers are allowed to have things for themselves.
---
If you're a rogue people expect you to open chests/doors for them, usually for free. 
---
 Never once gotten a tip for opening a locked chest in a dungeon when group wants to roll but you're the only one who can open
---
Yeah the honor patch has been a blast, I rolled on a PvP server and it was crazy how often people would ignore you while leveling/questing.
---
It finally feels like a PvP server.
---
Silver nodes everywhere
---
Imagine being so insecure that you berate someone else for a thing you do in the next sentence.

Interested to see how a negative comment can appear
---
Yeah I mean that’s true. I found the most effective thing was to never take zones even a level or higher. Stay in zones on level or preferably a level or two lower. I’ve never played a class that absolutely churned through zones a pinch lower. Charge kill intercept kill charge kill, etc. You can throw in LFG “tank lfg” and have instant queues or just mow through zones. More convinced than ever people are just doing it wrong.
---
I'm not really super up to date on all this, so what do you mean by the current tuning?  Is it currently tuned to be way easier than it was during vanilla?  What happened to no changes?

---
I have the same issue but no weekend guilds on my realm, everyone wants to raid on reset days it seems.
---
That’s your thing, and that’s fine, but keep in mind that some people have less free time than others and they value their time. Doesn’t make them despicable at all.
---
You want to leave or join Westfall? Which faction? Why?
---
Holy shit, are the numbers on that site accurate? My server, Rattlegore, is 80-20 Horde!? That's crazy
---
It’s really not that hard.  People just refuse to adapt and use things like invis pots, faps and the like.
---
I’ve run my level 54 mage to brd a number of times this weekend by just using one invis pot with zero corpse runs.  Friend did the same on his warrior with just 1 corpse run.
---
Nice projection, buddy.
---
The guild can run more than one group...
---
Are you being intentionally dense?
---
I noticed you ran out, take some of these , , , , , . . . . . .
---
Like it
---
Should be running brd until your eyes bleed anyway for HoJ and SGC. No reason *not* to do it and in fact now you have an incentive to do it since the world is trash to level in.
---
And yet, you're the one replying to all my posts! You have zero self awareness bwahah.
---
Things are mostly fine on my low pop realm (Judgement), but it really sounds awful to be on the full realms at this point, at least if you're in the lesser played faction. Long queues only to be instantly ganked and camped wherever you go once you do manage to log in. 
---
Part of the argument against the BGs being introduced early is that there was some time between them both in Vanilla WoW, and that it'd kill world PvP. Which is a decent point. But that's kind of made moot by the massively increased server population: As in the current state of world PvP is completely different from what it was. So if it's already not what it was, what is the problem with further changes? 
---
Another argument would be that some of the gear from the BG rep rewards is really good and impacts raid progression. Well, a simple solution to that would be to simply release the battlegrounds, allow players to get rep, but not release the rep rewards until later. As is already the case with Thorium Brotherhood, Argent Dawn, Timbermaw Hold etc where only a few rewards are available right now. You still get the PvP and honor rewards, your rep gains will still count and so forth. easy target. 
---
If there is a spike in cancelled subscriptions due to this, you can be sure Blizzard will act and release at least one BG. Or in some other way change the honor formula. To some degree I expect things to die down a bit as the initial thrill fades and people realise just how little honor you get from the zerg fests, but I just don't see how phase 2 in it's current state will ever really work on the biggest servers.
---
What did you expect? Did you play vanilla?
---
Apparently not. This is going exactly how I thought it would go. Known this for months
---
Lotta babies playing today eh?
---
I can’t wait for Blizzard to start listening to all you whining assholes and ruin classic. Private servers were better anyway.
---
I more like world pvp as, the opportunity for spontaneous fights to break out while leveling.  Or the ability to fight over farming spots.
---
When I played this game originally, at the start of BC, bigish pvp battles would break out, like I'd gank,  hed call friends, then I'd call friends.  Was fun.
---
Very different this time around.  And farming ho or in a huge raid isnt so fun for me either.
---
Lets go again shall we? 
---
&gt; **Create two combat logs**
---
OK so are you with me? Two logs. One for PvE activities and the other for all player related activities. 
---
&gt; **Don't allow players/addons to view the second log.**
---
This means the game client can view it and have all the information, but addons can't. Meaning that if you see someone 60 yards away you will visually be able to see what they are doing because the game client knows what's happening but not providing you with logs for it. 
---
From there you can basically create whatever restrictions and exceptions you want. Anything. Want people to get the full logs at 20 yards? Done. 30, 40, 50, never? Done. Want addons to have certain kinds of access but not others? Allow API access the returns the information when requested rather than a full log parse.
---
And so on. My point is that separating this information is not even a little 'impossible' and can absolutely be done.
---
You do not understand the point.
---
I am not complaining about getting ganked, I am complaining about PvP combat not being fun and not taking skill. It's still not fun and still doesn't take any skill when it's me ganking solo Alliance players with a 5 man squad and running away from their 10 man squad.
---
Well yea, Draenei aren't out yet.
---
&gt; I think a mod is the least of the problems that exist
---
what a colossally incorrect statement
---
Eh that's not entirely true. I see just as many toxic players just tell the people "whining" to get over it. Or some other moronic comment.
---
pathetic
---
lmao yeah that's the same
---
Negative, my nelf does this all the time if I don't submerge.
---
It sucks you can't stay in form while swimming on the water surface.
---
Yeah, I try to get off 1 MS if possible. If you have more than 2 targets, though, it's more important to be using WW off CD than it is to max value from a SS, especially because targets will die and WW will lose a lot of value if you wait even a few seconds.
---
I have been out in the world as a warrior farming all weekend. I have been ganked, I have ganked, I have grouped up to fight back and to just farm. There has been frustration but mostly good times.
---
&gt;Not to mention it wouldn't even help you in the same way spy does.
---
Quit making good points.  BUH BUH BUH YOU CAN JUST /TAR AND HURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
FPs in BB are shit
---
I want to leave Westfall. Have a character with 20g that I want to switch in Hearthseeker to mail it to my rogue
---
I'd be thoroughly surprised if you could define the word 'rational' without having to look it up. lol.
---
It’s mostly the casuals who level slow that are complaining the loudest.
---
Should’ve leveled faster 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Level 51 priest, been trying to level but it's like every 3 mins I get whacked by 4 people. Almost feels like I'm a quest mob
---
Anybody who isn't 60 by now is casual garbage anyway.
---
I should rolled a mage lmao
---
Don't sell rare items in the ah, sell them in trade chat where you cn negotiate. Start high and leave yourself open to offers
---
I can't help you with the 'not being fun' part, since that is purely subjective. But if you use the strategies I mentioned, you will find better results in PvP combat - and in my opinion choice of strategy is a large element of skill.
---
"I rely on you all, not the other way around. Please keep rotating out members so I can use all of you.
---
Then kindly fuck off." 
---
Sound about right?
---
Did you read the part where he was AFK? Or are you just here to blindly defend Spy?
---
I'm not sure why server population is seen as the main focus of your problems here. 
---
As far as the Blue posts explained it, the only difference between server pops then and now is a "tier" above what they were. 
---
So if Vanilla had a medium pop server, it would be considered low pop server today, etc. 
---
The problem is that Classic is a ***FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GAME*** and it has next to no major changes or tweaks done to it because the players here demand a purity test. 
---
Even IF they did normal server pops from Vanilla, you would still have the same exact problem you're having now. Let's look at what is happening. 
---
1) The Honor system is not even a week old right now. Because of that, everyone is going to be doing just that. Because it's the "new thing". I have no idea how it will play out long term though, but it's no surprise that a lot of people are doing the new thing. 
---
2) The players playing this game are entirely different than those that played in Vanilla on multiple levels. People are more organized. "Norms" are easier to establish and in some cases are already established i.e. fight in Hillsbrad.
---
Communication is way easier and more natural. I know that VOIP was a thing in Vanilla, but now VOIP is common place. Everyone has it everyone uses it. Guilds are more organized than before using things like Discord to keep everyone engaged and connected. Better organization leads to better things in game. 
---
3) The players are the victim of their own purity test. Blizzard is likely going to do next to nothing to address any of the issues you guys are experiencing because any change they make, for good or for ill, is going to lead to bitching and moaning by ***someone***.
---
This community wanted the Vanilla experience with no changes and that's exactly what they're getting.
---
What I don't like about BGs is how anti-RPG they are. Porting to an instance to do battle? No thanks. Then I rather they implement them without battlemasters. At least now the game feels like a constant battle.
---
I was doing something like this with a hunter bot but they were my faction, just feared the mob or tagged it before the pet did. Until I quickly got bored and reported them.
---
You are 100% right. Thank you bro
---
That's what a guild is for though? My guild leader and lots of the other people always help each other out.
---
We spend 3-4 hours with 4 people and to get one drop. Rng is rng.
---
Tonight, my alliance guild went to do MC. As per usual, the horde hugely outnumber us. So we went out and ran riot through burning steppes and BRM. The horde raid in there didn't know what hit them. It felt amazing, we were on the floating rock tomb thing in the middle, one horde raid at the bottom camping the portal, and another group behind us, and we got through with minimal casualties.
---
I also get regularly hunted and stomped when trying to do other tasks, leveling my alt is a nightmare, but still, I'm fuckin loving this phase so far. The world feels alive and dangerous. Its inconvenient as hell, but so damn fun.
---
It is just using the combat log. You can set filters yourself in combat log to get the same information it is getting. Buffs are applied on load in.
---
It will require code to be rewritten on the combat log.
---
&gt;fair pvp
---
ok boomer
---
Nada
---
It's not a vocal minority bro.  There are servers where the lower than 35 pop is all but disappearing.
---
Oh fuck that sounds really horrible for the horde players! I wish them a speedy recovery.
---
Meanwhile on my server, it's literally impossible to play as alliance outside the major cities unless you organize a big group to head out together with. And even then, they instantly organize and start summoning to wherever you went. 
---
Saying that it's impossible isn't even an understatement. I've probably died more in the past days than I did in total before honor was implemented.
---
Click on your Windows Start Button and type "Snip".
---
And that is why you suck at pvp
---
Seems so. I played a Hunter in Vanilla and I'm playing one in Classic, my eyes are always going to that minimap for new movement but a person will pop up on VanaKOS's little tracker before anything shows on my minimap.
---
I play super late night and don’t think I’d have a good time during peak times.
---
That's why you suck at pvp
---
I think people don't really remember that part. World pvp happend in vanilla yes of course, but at the most you'd see a 10 man raid in TM ganking in hillsbrad or even a cheeky raid in stv but nothing like this literal 100s of players parked up in a sone for hours just crushing people over and over
---
I’m a level 55 and I am basically a quest mob at this point.
---
Rogue sounds like so much fun in this phase. Glad you’re having fun :)
---
are you saying 70% is lower than 30%? lol
---
are you saying  that having 55%+ yellow crits with 38%- white is less valuable than having 40% yellow + 40% white? lol
---
are you saying your OH won't always hit when you have heroic strike queued? lol
---
you know who cares about crit cap? normie noobs like you
---
Lol
---
I wanted to roll PvP at launch to give Vanilla Wpvp a shot and realized at level 54 it wasn't for me (maybe it got better at 60... idk) But I re-rolled on a PvE server since that was how I have played the game since BC, no problems.  
---
I do think like others have said that the issue is probably because of the huge server sizes combined with the overwhelming amount of knowledge everyone has now as compared to back in Vanilla.
---
I stopped playing just before phase 2 and won't come back till they release battlegrounds because of it. This will play out to the alliances favor in the end though. Mainly because the ones who think they have mad skills but all they can do is run around in 40 man gank squads will get into battleground's and get rolled hard. And provide the alliance with insta queues on top of it due to the faction imbalances. I would rather lose the battle and win the war. The reckoning is coming.
---
As for the threat and dps...This is something that needs to be felt out with a consistent group but I can give some general pointers.  
---
Mag: Looking at my guilds 6 logs over month plus. Magmadar was a 1:45 sec fight when all were under geared. Now its 60 second fight. This is probably long I do not know.    
---
I would say start medium around 7-10 seconds of combat start. That is probably around 5 seconds of tank face time with boss. Ramp up to strong or full out around 12-15  seconds of pull. Waiting for 3 sunders is not what it use to be. Its a valid threat gauge but not always the best with how fast some of MC bosses fall.
---
Funny you say that, i mentioned im a bit behind and most already filled their raids, i just spent three hours passing on t2 head legs, brutality blade t1 hands and boots.
---
Sorry but mage should win vs rogue everytime, even 2v1.
---
I kind of agree, there are other things I'd much rather be amended.
---
How... how do you figure??? 
---
You wanna whine about saving time and making changes.... 
---
LFG was a change made to the game that removed the use of verbally looking for a group, or using any LFG chat cha nel, guild service or anything else. U just clicked a button and we're twleported to your dungeon of choice. It saved us time. Both things u stated above..... and I'm here to say that IMO, we don't need enormous time saving changers to classic wow. It isn't a go go go game mode.
---
go to retail
---
So after honor/world bosses were enabled? Ok, thank you
---
That's not pvp, it's being farmed like a quest mob
---

*Tedious
---
If you're a warrior it is, everyone else has a ton of trouble getting a group.  I grind quests, dead 70% of the time while spamming groups trying to get into BRD and nobody wants me
---
This actually makes a tonne of gold. There is a guy on my server that does it as well. 3g per summon. You join his group, get the summon and be on your way. At the same time you get half a dozen other people doing the same thing. Its easily 1k gold per hour on big servers.
---
That sounds terrible unless he’s only on for a few hours.
---
Yes
---
Ok horde.
---
Shhhhh! That's what I've been doing lol
---
The people who are corpse camping level 30s and are level 60s are the very reason retail evolved into retail. 
---
It's a self inflicted curse.  Super cool guys literally destroy the game they want and then complain about it. If they came to classic later than start date those same people would be on here flaming everyone crying.
---
Pretty accurate from alliance side. You do feel the imbalance now that wpvpp is live but there are moments where a small Ally group can get.in some payback. Farming is becoming an issue though 
---
It only takes an extra player or two to push out the other faction
---
Solo rogue here, make your own groups/get ubrs key/max lockpicking. 
---
You can easily run in groups as a solo rogue.
---
Omfg shut the fuck up!
---
South corner. Elementals are north yeah? Hes grindinh quesless pointless mobs
---
I still don't think bgs would fix this issue tho, cause some horde on certain servers would have massive ques, thus making world pvp gank squads better for min max honor farm. Granted they wouldn't get badges but you can always accept que while you are out crushing players in EPL
---
Being a druid with 2 hots means being incredibly careless about your lava jump and taking 190% of your health in damage and still coming out  with half health (unless there's tonnes of skeletons on the ramp up, then you be more careful)
---
Hahahahaha oh please. Installing an addon that screams at you every time something of note happens that you would NEVER notice yourself is not skill.
---
Even people who were using combat logs without addons.. it required a ton of vigilance at all times and you got nowhere near the level of information you do now... especially from the limited logs that were given to people in classic.
---
My server slightly favors the other faction and I still think its a lot of fun.
---
It's about the same. It depends on server ticks and latency and such, but pretty much the same.
---
It's funny cuz most people complaining want retail. Layers, ability to turn off pvp, etc
---
translation: you make $11.5 an hour sitting in a lab with a bunch of people who dont speak english
---
keep crying about world pvp you fucking noob XDDD
---
Reeeeee logic reeeee
---
Why would people stay when they are the lower pop faction at 70/30 and get whacked off when they land at a flight path and cant even move 20 feet?
---
Yes, farming, not lvling.  You're 60 right?
---
You dont have to do a full clear, just advertise for specific things like arena anger golem, lava skip runs, etc. Usually those runs are like 20-30 mins depending on group and you dont have to do most of the bosses you dont want.
---
"Games are supposed to cater specifically to whatever I find fun and if they don't must immediately change so I am no longer inconvenienced. Anyone criticizing me is a meanie head." 
---
This mentality is what killed Vanilla originally and what continues to kill many cool things.
---
I can't really understand what youre saying
---
There's also a teleporter in gadgetzan. Takes you right inside gnomer. Close to instance entrance. Never have to see a single ally.
---
Hasn't even been a week.
---
It's been three days.
---
I’m more surprised someone is leveling a character named after a a huge twat.
---
I mean how would you know? I started on Alliance PvE to play with my friends, when they stopped playing I moved to Horde PvP with other friends. Between people quitting, moving, and the vast majority of people who don't talk to the external community and roll whatever. 
---
If you can't handle getting ganked just play on PvE and BG when it's released. If you roll PvP you are looking to gank, there is no other way unless you're ultra naive.
---
On top of that, tons of people are logging in and playing. My server queue times  have spiked massively.
---
If it was so awful we would see fewer people playing, not more.
---
Server is horde dominated. They roll over every zone :^)
---
We had moved 3 times previously and twice after. Horde just steamroll due to sheer numbers.
---
Well said
---
53 is kind of a weird level for tanks. You're too high to get much benefit from ST, and just slightly too low for a lot of BRD unless your group wants to go super slowly.
---
Yeah honor came out Friday, and I was in WS on Saturday after PvPing a bunch... Not sure if any world bosses had spawned or whatever, but it was definitely after the honor patch.
---
It could have been just extreme luck, but I've had runs of 250+ and not found a single EoS... 700+ is pretty extreme but with a 1/100 drop rate it's not impossible.
---
Horde had every point from SG flight path too BRD fully camped. This turns a 2.5 hour BRD run into a 4 hour run. Who has 4 hours to burn?
---
I want to go fire pvp or “elemental” pvp and was curious how much gear I need to pull it off. Do I need to be rockin t1 to have a shot to hang in there or am I able to get used to the play style? I’m approaching 60 and am in a raiding guild but not sure if I’ll have a spot since they have been going for a couple months. Not super worried about that as I’m more for having fun. But if the recommendation is get some gear and then do whatever that’s fine too. Just didn’t know how much the split difference between having the best out of raid gear vs t1 stuff would be in pvp setting.
---
Those PVE boss mods I blame on blizzard because they've decided to broadcast exactly where the boss abilities would strike and allowed players to fully avoid those attacks.  Even things such as a melee attack swing would telegraph where it would hit in advance. It's dumb and lazy design.  They did this so they didn't have to balance exactly how much damage the bosses did, they just gave them infinite fuck you damage, but made it avoidable.  
---
These mods did exactly what Blizzard intended the players to do, and make it slightly easier. Can't really compare that to Spy.
---
&gt; and it's ruining the game for thousands of ~~people~~ alliance players.
---
FTFY. I've never seen Horde levy this complaint. I think there are *maybe* two servers where they're in the minority and that's only because Alliance players fled from Horde-dominated servers.
---
I think id be fine in a 15 v 15 but outplayed situation that I chose to enter than a 1 v 15 everywhere you go kinda thing.
---
Stating that OW is an FPS game first is still being disingenuous though imo, as I’d firmly argue OW plays more like a MOBA than an FPS, though OW being an FPS game is still technically correct.
---
You knew you were outnumbered if you roll alliance on pvp servers. That was obvious. It also was obvious that blizzard won't introduce faction based balancing until it was too late. It was obvious that phase 2 would be a complete shitfest the second they told us the classic servers will hold more people than actual vanilla servers. And if you knew all that and knew the ruleset of their pvp servers I don't get why you complain.
---
Are you in the driver seat?
---
It's this stupid mindset that if it's not 100% good then it's 100% bad.
---
As a troll rogue,i feel you maaan
---
I'm currently stalking Horde above Kargath. The Graveyard is right there too.
---
I'm not "complaining endlessly" I've stated that you did and that I don't want to carry on the conversation, something you seem not able to understand. Why is that so hard for you? You're the one complaining endlessly and refusing to let this go yet also accusing me of being "emotionally invested" and, quite frankly, being a real dick about.
---
People don't have to speak to you if they don't want to and this conversation isn't one I want to spend any more time on. Thought I was pretty clear and polite about it but I guess reading what people write isn't a skill you have.
---
I'll make it easier for you, I'm disabling notifications from this post. All the best
---
How ‘bout fuck Texas? Yeah!
---
This was a holy paladin from olympus for context
---
Not surprised at all. What mean is... your original comment implied that time saving changes are good for classic. And IMO.... maybe some could be but I doubt this. Adding things like summoning stones and LFG to classic would be a waste and a ruin. 
---
If you disagree u must  not have played in vanilla days.
---
As an Alliance leveling on Stalagg this is is nice to hear. Thank you
---
exactly this. If a random group asks me to tank, you better believe I'm not in the dungeon to look at the scenery for 50% of the time. I want to get it done.
---
You don't need to go to Thorium point. Badlands and Blasted Lands both have reasonably close, safe flight points.
---
If you didn't want to play on a PvP server you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server.
---
I can't even get to BRD.
---
You seriously overestimate the usefulness of Perception.
---
I am currently doing 1 Mara run in 8-9 min getting 10300 xp at level 53 I find this is a much better AOE spot due to the recent release of the Honour rankings all the world AOE spots are crazy, I have tried Western Plaguelands got roughly 7k xp in 10 min (got ganked once-lucky) so Mara is still a viable option until 55ish I guess, I am also looking to try solo BRD runs next. P.S. I complete 1 Mara run in 4 pulls (2 on Worms 2 on Turtles) I will be posting a video on youtube soon. Also, thank you Frost for making these vids, they have helped me a lot :)
---
I love how a single classic wow post can’t go by without someone making a comment shitting on retail. Like damn.
---
Your memory sucks then lol
---
Try coming in from the other side, its generally (IMO) clearer
---
Nobody was blacklisted for camping fps or running around in raids killing people...
---
A lot around 6pm-12 but my work hours vary and I do also play with a few irl friends. So I it would be messaging to see if the other person is free more then always playing at a set time
---
If you didn't want to play on a PvP server you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server. There I fixed the problem for you.
---
yeah in like 6 years
---
Is the 5 piece bonus of druid t1 any good?
---
I think it'll pass once battlegrounds come around. It's just so much better and lucrative even on pvp servers.
---
I actually remember these kind of people gloating here were the same ones whining that BGs killed their precious little wpvp.
---
As are you
---
Yes bc we have to pick right ^^^^/s
---
They already confirmed that even “medium” pop on a classic realm is significantly larger than “full” was in vanilla.
---
I've played on a PvP server since vanilla came out. Right now this has jack shit to do with what PvP has ever been, only someone completely deluded about what world PvP is would spout such utter nonsense.
---
This isn't the vanilla experience, it's not even a wow experience, it's just a mess of incompetent developers and sadistic man-children.
---
One simple fix imo.  Low level players always count as dishonorable kills. Anyone 6 levels lower than you makes you lose honor.
---
Yeh trying to not die in the first place.
---
I tried that. Only died a few times but the entrance too the mountain was still shut off. Then you start spawning from the other side.
---
&gt;Come on, any decent player was lvl 60 a month ago.
---
Has nothing to do with that, it's more of a function of time availability.
---
\#nochanges, remember?
---
Are you okay? What's the significance of the random capitalized letters in your comment? If 3000 player cap worked in vanilla, which it did, it will work in classic. What doesn't work is capping the realms at 15000+ players without changing the size, layout and resource availability in zones, especially on pvp servers.
---
Lovestospooge
---
&gt; They had no idea, none, that this would happen. They are, furthermore, stuck with a playerbase so far in their egotistic asshole that many believe, against all evidence to the contrary, that they do know what we want. Well, we wanted more servers, and no - they aren’t dead, dying or doomed.
---
The issue is that if they did have an over abundance of servers, they would ***absolutely*** have dead servers or servers that had low populations.
---
Because that's ***exactly*** what happened in Vanilla. Moving and merging those servers is no simple task and often unfair to the players on those servers. 
---
The players had ample opportunity to change to a different server after name day and before the official launch. Servers like Herod had players who ***refused*** to move. 
---
You can't blame that shit on the developers. 
---
Servers can always be added, and server transferring was made easy and the player was ***always*** made aware when that was possible and why. Hell, I still get a transfer option whenever I log in on my server when it is full.
---
They played it right when it came to setting up servers. The player behavior is what they couldn't predict, or force people to correct.
---
You usually have to raid for a week or two before you get gear.
---
Got my Spinal Reaper last night after 6 weeks of downing Rag, was only my second peace of raid loot.
---
Patience friend
---
Blizzard: "You think you want it, but you don't."
---
Players: "No, we really do!"
---
Blizzard: "Okay, here you go, then."
---
Players: "Wait not like this"
---
Ya I joined the channel for them like right away, haven't used it yet but it's really smart.
---
Yes it does, it will tell the player there is a stealthed rogue nearby, and you can prevent getting ganked by using AoE to knock him out.
---
Edit: why downvote for explaining why spy isn’t useless?
---
World pvp owns sorry battlegrounds should be delayed
---
You're most welcome to learn how to google that yourself.
---
And of course it matters. If one person has Spy then OK.. that's one person with a massive advantage. Everyone having it significantly changes a *lot* about PvP.
---
It's the NE reality
---
My priest buddy got his eye finally, literally get down there to farm. Killed a couple demons for like 5 minutes, get ganked, 5-10 minute run back into the first demon kill and his shadow drops
---
Pve server. Pvp server are treating anyone level 50-60 like they're farming for a quest
---
I was in Grim most of Canilla, Brenya the Warlock, Vixin Priest. I was wondering where everyone had moved too. I was also in Drunken Lords before I rolled Horde side Drunken Lords are on Dalaran US now
---
He's a Chinese government guy, pro rape, murder, etc. Expect nothing less. If you want proof, just check his profile.
---
Melee mage
---
Your alliance guys come _out_ of Southshore? Man that must be nice.
---
Blizzard needs to stop profiting off of new age/rapper drugs! Enough is enough! Stop glorifying lean and sipping on a double cup blizzard smh
---
should have just released everything at once and see how long it takes to down kelthuzad
---
But I don't know how ranking works and need to farm right now!!!!!!!!!
---
Retart for sure
---
I play Alliance and i solo.
---
Weird
---
My server is balanced apparently but today it really didn't feel that way. Maybe 59 is just not a fun lvl to be. I did do a little rahe quit today but I'll be nack.
---
I mean, what can anyone really do? Blizz are hold all the cards.
---
I'm confused, you say you were a warlord feral druid in vanilla, then link a video where you're somehow doing Arena, which wasn't added until TBC, can you explain?
---
Pro dps and heals is just as much work as main tank.
---
It’s just that leveling you don’t encounter many pro deeps or healers but if the tank isn’t pro you wipe a lot.
---
&gt; Yea true but many of those hobbies probably dont include watching pixels on a screen in a dark room days on end.
---
Maybe they do, maybe they don't. At the end of the day as long as you do things in moderation and don't go overboard with them then there's no problem as long as you enjoy it.
---
&gt;30% of it is fun, 70% of vanilla is a grind and timedump.
---
Now that honor is out, I'm finding it's more like 90% fun and 10% timedump/grind.
---
I've gotten 2 levels since phase 2 started but I do have a crazy work schedule. Playing  a mage for the first time so just grinding a little bit on off peak hours in low popularity spots.
---
No site will be 100% accurate as long as Blizzard doesn't disclose the numbers but anecdotally, 60:40 Horde is closer to reality than 75:25 Alliance. Unless 90% of the Alliance are sitting in their cities, the OP's link is highly inaccurate. Going around the open world or even neutral cities like gadgetzan pre-honor system, there's 4-6 horde for every 1 alliance I see.
---
Don’t re roll a rogue is great.   Not sure what server your on but we have room in our guild. Every class is treated fair.  Also it is the class we have the fewest of
---
They can be traded unless equipped or you leave. I thought it was a funny joke but he hearthed to Ironforge
---
Blizzard encouraged these mods through game design. I don't think they encouraged Spy the same way. I don't get why this opinion would get such a hostile response, but hey reddit.
---
Are you an idiot? Did u actually read what i said? Let me clarify it for you. 
---
1) Killing individual 50s or lower IS lame, and as i said we dont do that. Wheres the fun if there isnt any competition? Easy kills are boring and quite frankly pointless. 
---
2) I wasnt talking about running around the map looking for people minding their own business and questing. 
---
3) When did i ever say i wasnt dying? Because i AM, and probably a lot more than the number of people i kill. Never said i was any good.
---
4) I AM talking about pvping against other groups of 4 or 5, generally around brd where there are usually a lot of horde waiting to pvp.
---
And not a single person asking for blizz to keep things the way they are seems to be thinking this far ahead.
---
I mean I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying Alliance on Whitemane. I'm just saying I never expected there to be such a large number of people. Horde completely dominate everywhere all at once. At least that's been my experience the last few days. And I'll admit that it didn't occur to me that that'd be possible.
---
Honestly I’ve considered this, but I don’t want to miss the fun or the chance to have fun in world pvp. Not sure if there’s much to enjoy as I’m not a big pvp person myself
---
Because since meridian 95 and Ultima online pk/pvp ruleset servers obviously meant only fair and nice fights are allowed. /s
---
#nOcHaNgEs
---
But seriously, not a bad idea. Or offer free server transfers only to players of the dominant faction.
---
weird, at that level your single target deeps should be decent, + CC  if they have issues with SGC then tell them to ML the boss
---
Yes, because that's not possible on a PvE server. Is there some part of that you don't understand?
---
2005-2007 Thottbot and Elitist Jerks was life.
---
This game is nothing like the old classic WoW, especially for us Europeans where BGs were already out when we hit 60.
---
And I doubt any part of the community likes getting corpse camped by death squads that abuse an add-on?
---
Really don't understand how asking for a solution, that would make world pvp better for both factions, any closer to retail. Hell even [private servers](https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1441971787984.jpg) release BGs in stage 1.
---
I’m confused.  I joined a medium pop server for classic and it feels way way way less crowded than the one I was on in vanilla.  What facts do we have to support the theory classic servers are more crowded than vanilla?
---
I can't Google a negative. If you are saying it changed provide proof, because as far as I can tell it's still the same.
---
It’s been less than a week every last one of you making a post complaining in any way are absolutely ridiculous. It was so obvious that this giant Zerg of people would appear as layering dropped and honor system came out that I can’t believe any of you are surprised, it’s also exceedingly obvious that in another two weeks it will die out and go back to normal as people get bored. Then when BGs are out world PvP will again, 14 years after it died the first time will be dead again. . STOP FUCKING WHINING YOU PLEBS
---
\&gt;the enemy faction outnumbers my faction by a wide margin
---
\&gt;didn't hit 60 in time scrub that's all on you
---
????
---
Sounds like fun, i dont really have any friends playing, started with one and his brother but they both quit at lvl 30 and ive.been playing solo for like 2 and a half months, this weekend i bailed on going to a moving in party at a friends house, not so much for the need to play wow even tho i did and it was semifun, more so because of the social anxiety and the unpleasant feelings of leaving the safezone etting the time run away while distracted by a game.
---
Its definitly time for me to quit or the very least start becoming a raidlogger and have days that i dont play at all instead using all that time working on and improving myself.
---
Wtf does a pixel on a screen do for me 5 or even 20 years from now?
---
On grob, you gotta rp and hope that you don't get ran over by the train of wPvPers
---
Even more so, friend decent players (especially tanks and healers)  Then hit them up for groups (or they'll buzz you if they have DPS spots)
---
...by players, as a player
---
It's sad, when this patch dropped, I figured WPvP would be a nightmare... so I said "you know what, I'm going to hide in a cave and grind out my last few levels"
---
I get it, PVP happens on a PVP server, so I won't be an idiot sitting out in the middle of the zone like a sitting duck.
---
It went well... for about 15 minutes... until the stupid people using spy obviously found out. An entire raid came into the cave in Blasted Lands just to kill me. Seriously, an entire raid for 1 level 57 priest harmlessly grinding mobs to get some xp.
---
Yeah I have not logged in since it dropped. Tried getting to BRM, ganked twice by a raid of 40 (presumably giving them fuckall points) - logged out until this shit sorts itself out.
---
Join a BRD spell cleave farming “what’s going on” quest. Great XP and can do it to 60 if you want.
---
" If they aren't then you have you every right to complain. "  
---
No you don't. You don't go to a peanut eating contest and then throw a fucking hissy fit because you're allergic to peanuts.
---
There's literally 15years worth of private server videos showing what life is like on a PVP server.
---
Last day of Nostalrius videos alone would've shown you what wpvp on a massive server is like.
---
Oh damn... ya if I remember correctly.. I may need to look again it wasn’t much higher than vendor. That is some serious cash then. I feel like I get tons of those
---
I agree if dps are doing their job properly, but this is so rare - even at endgame.
---
I really hope they don't go this route, I enjoy the imbalance playing as Alliance on a horde dominated server. There's never a lack of action and I absolutely love it.
---
Peontrees
---
“About as lame as I expected”
---
*stayed on pvp server despite expecting it*
---
Everyone is super bitchy about getting ganked - YOU ROLLED A PVP SERVER. You should, and rightfully so, expect yourself to get corpse camped for hours. That is the essence of a PvP server. Every once in awhile you get a nice, fair fight. That’s fun and everything. But you can’t turn off your flag, that is a RULE of the server, so let me explain something...
---
If you wanted the option to turn off your PvP flag, you shouldn’t have rolled on a PvP server.
---
its funny how almost everyone calls it world pvp
---
but what they actualy do is honor farming and when they meet same sized party, they run becouse being dead isnt effective in this honor farm
---
i dont mind, well i do, but cant do anything about it, big raiding groups farming honor points, just dont call it pvp, it has nothing to do with pvp if u run away as soon as some real challage shows up
---
It will be.
---
This is literally the worst it will be, right now.
---
Little things add up, people remember these small actions and if there's ever a situation where you just barely beat a boss, it may have been due to your contribution.
---
The problem is Alliance vs horde. Alliance are typically the casual pve players and the horde is usually the try hard pvpers. It's like this in every single 2 faction game where there is a 'good' and 'bad' side. The casual minded people will always go to the good, whereas the more pvp oriented and try hards will gravitate to the dark side. It's human nature. This is why you see all these alliance complainers making threads.
---
Oof, you may have made the wrong choice when you created your character.
---
Yea. He got lucky when he rolled the die to decide which class he'd play. You got the shit end of the stick when rng decided what class youd play.
---
So you want a server with 20% of the players being unhappy to prevent 60% of the server's total players from logging in in order to make the 20% happier. But not entirely because a bunch of those 20% are still going to get farmed in WPvP since pvpers are still out for blood until BGs come out.
---
I'm not going to go into arguments about who "should" be unhappy as a result of faction choice. But if you're just shifting around who's unhappy, you're solving nothing.
---
I'm sorry, but this is a dumb idea and it will still be a dumb idea every time it gets posted.
---
I can be mana burned by the diviners in SM, the shadow casters in uldaman, and the mana aberrations in DM.
---
Hurr durr
---
World PvP still happens on all pve servers, we just go over because we want the CHOICE of when to do it
---
I feel like this mentality doesn't really display much experience with actual PvP games.
---
People on the populated side say "QQ L2P".
---
Then people start to discover that most "PvPers" like the idea of PvP, and like to win, but when they are not winning, they take their ball and go home. A few months later, the people that were "winning" wonder where the fuck everyone went.
---
In the end, everyone loses.
---
This isn't a complaint from me, it's a statement of fact, and experience, going back to 1996 in Ultima Online pre-trammel, Darksun Online, Asherons Call Darktide, Shadowbane, Darkfall, basically the most brutally unforgiving MMORPGs to date, that had an actually engaging combat system (eve discounted on this basis).
---
This situation, is something that hasn't really ever been experienced in WoW. Not even in vanilla. Servers were not so imbalanced. Since 2004, until now, World PvP has been almost 100% consequence free. You lose a little bit of time, but ultimately you're not that interrupted. Occasionally you get corpse camped, but it's the exception, not the rule.
---
What's going on in Classic on the big unbalanced PvP servers, is as close to actual consequential world PvP as WoW has ever had. It's approaching "I died, and lost all my gear" levels of consequence. Most people who are playing WoW, and the PvP servers, did not sign up for corpse camping as the rule, as opposed to the exception, and people are going to quit in droves.
---
Just how it is.
---
Okay Reddit police. Take your own advice and just not look at the Reddit posts of people whining. Very easy fix.
---
Stopping at every level -9 to just fuck around for a while... I really wanted that again this time around.
---
Honestly this is what makes me the saddest. People yelling for years to get the old community driven servers of vanilla back, then *immediately* doing everything they can to make the game as miserable as possible for as many people as possible. 
---
I played a lot of vanilla and while yes, there was ganking and griefing it was nothing like what classic is right now. People *will* quit and that benefits nobody.
---
The problem here is how would you bring in a new friend? Final Fantasy 11 had an interesting idea where you had to get  someone already on the server to let you join if it was a high pop server.
---
Only if you’re terrible.  There’s lots of ways to get in with a minimum of corpse runs.  Try having some invis pots and stuff like that.
---
Here is a better solution for you, join a pve server
---
I’ve never hated Rogues more in my life. When I’m level 60 I’m going to kill every rogue any level just to get my goddamn frustration out.
---
Refer to my original comment
---
I fucking love phase two and i fucking love world PvP with no battlegrounds. I don't mind dying a few times here and there. Seeing the world filled with small groups of people skirmishing is amazing and something I will sorely miss come battlegrounds.
---
server capacity was much smaller, it was much harder to zerg all areas at once
---
You have to actually get to 60 to enjoy it. I'm being really pessimistic rn because it's a miserable experience leveling these last 9 levels. Maybe it'll get better but it wasn't this bad in real vanilla wow.
---
Personally i too enjoy the imbalance from a minority perspective, but I'm a rogue so I'm biased. all of my non-stealth guildies are suffering.
---
Iam very curious if all the crying on reddit now is just a very vocal minority or actually what everyone wants.
---
Paladins are the most in demand raid healers on alliance. You need at least 4 for raid buffs. And they are the most efficient raid healers in the game. Also, there are not many pallys running around at end game, so finding a raid is usually easy.
---
What the hell is wrong with people like you? Seriously. This is a game, one that requires a huge amount of time investment.
---
People who have decided PvP isn't for them your solution is.. what? Reroll and lose hundreds of hours? Quit? Who does that help?
---
Personally I want every single person on a PvP server to *want* to be there. Not feel they have to be.
---
Wait there will be cross realm bgs? That kinda stinks.
---
I mean, Does it matter?
---
If we’re allowed to go to pve servers, how does that affect you?
---
I need a zoomer translator here.
---
I don't like this for the times you need to go help a buddy whose getting ganked.
---
Wada? Why did you invade IF solo.
---
Your pay scale numbers are off by a lot but the English thing is pretty accurate
---
Yea they fucked up with the pop increase.
---
Yep as a rogue if a same faction member tries to steal skins I usually mount up, run out of view and stealth walk all the way back to at least try and catch them off guard
---
So players make suggestions, then Blizzard decides if they are good ideas based on the data they have. Seems pretty reasonable to me.
---
You misunderstand. If they are fighting a mob you can mark that and immediately know their location. I use this method all the time.
---
Find a real guild, not a support network for a leeching GM.
---
Ah, I didn't get that impression from what I'd been told.
---
Same as shammies then.
---
It should be removed but giving you info you wouldn't have is what almost all addons do
---
Lol.
---
No ,I am not.
---
Lol, you must be new
---
Hibernation doesn't speed up regeneration. If anything, it greatly slows it down, along with all other metabolic processes. So no, this behavior is accurate.
---
However, I'd propose letting druids fish in bear form. But only in rivers and only for salmon.
---
I just wanted to play with my friends so I guess my entire guild made the wrong choice.
---
Where are you at where you only have 1 player attacking you? Every time someone attacks me their 2-3 friends show up a few seconds later to really pour it on
---
He brings the repair bots?
---
I'm not saying cut off the majority faction to a perfect 50/50, what I'm saying is they could bottleneck the influx of logins from the majority faction to a rate they feel fit.
---
EDIT: a word
---
How does me leaving affect you?  Why are you against me leaving?
---
No
---
STV savage coast
---
People just blindly undercut — doing whatever their addon tells them to do.
---
I played on a PVP server from Vanilla to Cataclysm.
---
I regret rolling on a PVP server and not having the foresight to realize how bad things would be with the massive population sizes.
---
It was never, ever this bad in all my years of playing before. Classic PVP is simply unlike anything before, due to the massive population and massive faction imbalances.
---
I think a lot of Vanilla experience was indirectly affected by the server caps being around ~3000.  Blizzard wanted to show off their technical capabilities by increasing the player caps exponentially.  This doesn't fall into the "You think you do, but you don't" category because this ISN'T the way Vanilla was.  My ally toon on Incendius gets destroyed 15 times making it's way to BRD, and my Horde toon on Skeram has to join a raid to get some slim pickings.
---
Point being, you can hate current WPVP and still be #nochanges.
---
You're argument is essentially "we shouldn't fix problems because people who complain are just being babies."
---
This is enough to give a level 60 Paladin a PTSD breakdown 
---
The blood splatter.....the lifeless hand....
---
WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?!!? DAMN YOU MARSHAL MCBRIDE!!!
---
If it's 5 groups out of thousands of players it won't particularly impact gameplay. So long as the % is low it should be fine.
---
Yes everything seems to matter, you make incremental but very tangible gains frequently and there’s a lot of avenues to pursue. When I played this game the first time 15 years ago I was 15. All I wanted to do was PvP, this time around at 30 I’m excited for the world PvP, I enjoy it but I’m getting so much more enjoyment out of the RPG qualities as you put it. Planning where I’m going next, leveling professions and gathering materials. Reading the quests and immersing myself is so much more satisfying this time around. It’s apparent throughout if you want it to be

Nice, content for Asmon tomorrow!
---
In the ass or mouth?
---
Bwaa
---
People like that need a way to get their micro dicks hard, and fanning around flightmasters is what does it for them.
---
Alright thanks for the heads up!
---
My thought is that you sound like a little bitch. Imagine saying to a group of people, openly admitting your a scared coward and want to quit until you can be a casual in bgs and afk in them.
---
Also imagine questing past 50.......LOLOLOL. At 55 you shouldn't be questing or doing anything accept getting your prebis in brd etc.
---
Well good for you then because the loudest screamers are usually the people who play the game the least aka reddit
---
You will lose all buffs from players who are not in your raid group when you enter the instance.
---
Honestly, medium pop servers are pretty low pop.  Im on a High pop PvE server and its still nothing compared to another high pop PVP realm i have some toons on.
---
To have even fewer players than my realm might feel a bit empty.  My server certainly isnt empty/dead/whatever, but its not anywhere near as active as many (maybe most?) servers.
---
Silithus*
---
Ya but if i wont play on westfall better take that extra 20😂
---
I think this.  Hi, now we’ve met, including OP.  That’s two.   Now read thru the thread, at least 20 more.
---
Uh the add on would tell them its under vendor. These are idiots on auto pilot sans addon
---
PvE servers are a thing.
---
Oh sure let me turn up my sound to 100 to literally stealth-hack and detect players stealthing 50 yards away. That'll work
---
"They're brutal mindless savages, murder them!"
---
Meanwhile the quilboars have frigging maps and writing. Tauren starting zone started me off feeling bad.
---
Dont know in what way 40 man deathsquads, lagfest in hillsbread where meeles die in a sec and mages are the only one jumping in with aoe while the rest mount around like sheeps at the same time as a 1v1 duel is just not happening is fun but if u think  it is, good for you!
---
I actually play the game in copious amounts because I choose NOT to take adderal.  
---
As for this gank meta I can’t speak on it.  Hasn’t happened to me yet.
---
Been known since pre-release.
---
Sure fire way to identify a triggered OP?  “It’s actually hilarious”.
---
The Badlands Shortcut.
---
Why not? Always fun to just mess around and get some pvp wherever it may be. 
---
That said, I'm usually not solo, I usually roll to IF with a couple of guildies (or summon them there once I arrive). Usually get a bit of pvp for a while until eventually I get swarmed enough. We always have a blast seeing how long we can fortify and hold a house!
---
Where is a good place to level up ranged weapons? I'm a 60 Rogue.
---
I'm thinking some sort of ranged mob that doesn't hit very hard so I can just auto shoot to my heart's content without killing it very quickly. Maybe something like a mid-40s elite. 
---
Also, is there a macro for my autoshot to keep autoshooting?
---
I can't speak for other ally, but I don't attack unless the other side instigates. Basically, if you wanna fight, we can fight. But if there's a 15 level gap between us, it's not really a fight is it?
---
Don’t loot the devil until people piss off and go away. Even if you have to have one despawbed send a message. Just started Devil farming myself. Some good vids out there! Think I’m gonna hit the crater during wee hours of the morning.
---
the way i see it, without battlegrounds world pvp is cancer. on my server i cant walk around in a 50+ zone without getting ganked by a squad of people running around trying to get honor points. i dont blame them, i have been part of a squad trying to get some honor, which was insanely boring. running around with 4-39 others hunting down the opposing force, but normally only finding one or two here and there. Its absolutely impossible to level in those zones as of now.
---
i liked world pvp like it was before honor points, it was scary running around in the wild, someone could come try to kill you while you quest. you are looking over your shoulder.. but now, you cant take 10 steps without having 10 people steamrolling over you. Its no fair fights. 
---
I hope blizzard sees this and releases battlegrounds asap. Not to kill world pvp, but to make it livable again. 
---
"go play on a pve server" is a bad argument aswell, i want world pvp, i just dont want constant ganking squads running around trying to kill as many solo players as they can find. 
---
its not a black and white matter, its not world pvp or no world pvp.. 
---
just think back three weeks, how many were complaining about world pvp? nobody, the only difference is that this is the first week of honor gains.
---
So? Unless i die when landing from a FP which is camped, it's fairly easy to avoid the chaos, even if it means rez running a few times.
---
I'm not stealthing around mobs of 60s.
---
I love how salty the pvp players get about letting us leave pvp servers.  It’s like they’re scared they will have to pvp people who are not casuals.
---
isn't mage t1 good for pvp at least, because of all the stam on it? regardless that guy sounds like a dumb bastard.
---
Lol pussy
---
Rogue is the only class that can literally kill be before I get one shot off... seems a little buggy. I can actually dmg a hunter.
---
I fit squarely in that corner. Hating the other faction and having them hate you is what makes the world alive.
---
It's been taking me upwards of 40min to get from the FP to BRD/LBRS/UBRS, but I love it. I make sure to kill any lowbie horde I see as retaliation. Feed the fire.
---
Ahahaha felt the same for me. 
---
This was also the reason I didn't uninstall it. I figured a lot of people will use it. And I ain't giving up that advantage. But since them I've been hoping for it to be banned.
---
10iq post
---
Oh shit I missed that my b.
---
Most of it was in Felwood! You gotta choose the places that are less dense. Dont get me wrong, there are a bunch of groups who dont care at all. But who would have figured being respectful is contagious and spreads to others
---
Sounds like Stalagg to me
---
Wpvp with bgs out is ideal as an alliance so I can yah know play the game? Every fp is camped to a surgical level by horde right now  alliance are just starting to not log on for now. I kill 8 rogues in IF in under 30 mins last night.
---
Nope. Took my party 7 yesterday over an hour.
---
1. Campers on FM
---
2. Start of the ramp of BRM
---
3. Door of BRM
---
4. Second door of BRM
---
5. After "the jump"
---
6. After the narrow entrance
---
7. Open area with big blocks
---
One of my friends called me lucky because it took his party 11 tries lol.
---
P.S: we suggested to go to Steppes but people reported the FM to be dead. FAPs were also useless as that doesn't stop the massive damage from coming. I only used 2 before realizing I still wouldn't be able to make 10 yards per life.
---
Eventually you'll want the 20% extra ambush/backstab if you're daggers, but skipping it for now is fine. If I were to throw together a dagger PvP build off hand, I'd use something like this https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305300105-3023-55024010033012
---
To be fair, you did join a raid lead by Olympus.
---
How many times an I going to see this post
---
Pyrewood village had queue, I did census with two account same time and overall less than 7k online.
---
That would be 5.5 summons per minute. Maybe 1000 gold a night but still, not worth the time and effort imo.
---
Find a guild that needs a rogue
---
It'll be tougher though, the "full on rogues" part is why i rolled a warlock this time around. I mained a rogue in vanilla but I got sick of every group already have rogues.
---
If you want a DPS that's more in demand and works for PVP what about lock like i did?
---
If you still want stealth druids are always underplayed and LOTS of druid gear seems to drop all the damn time.
---
Leatrix plus “faster auto loot”
---
Can you tell me what your routine is for BRD farming?
---
There is no way for an addon to get coordinates of enemy players. It uses the player coordinates as reference, and it communicates within the party so whoever detects the player first will share their (own) coordinates.
---
Well until then there is a wait to log into my server.
---
Mine took 5 minutes. Gl on the transfer.
---
I already played for 3 months so ive done what is available in the game and its clear to me ive come to a point that ive realised that its just not that fun and just all huge timesink.
---
If i still was 16? Yea, now? Patience to wait on one piece of gear definitly isnt there.
---
Retail's problems are design decisions. 
---
A good example is PvP gear. 
---
Players want a vendor. They want to earn currency and spend it on gear that they want. 
---
Blizzard made the design decision that PvP gear should be good and usable in other parts of the game. 
---
So now, with that decision in mind, you have to remove the PvP vendor, because otherwise PvP becomes a mandatory activity for anyone looking to gear up, rather than an alternate gearing system. 
---
So PvP gear has to be RNG. 
---
No amount of polish on that system is going to fix the problem. You could get the shiniest goddamn polish in the world and scrub that system for years, you won't be able to fix the problem that PvP gear being relevant outside of PvP breaks the retail endgame. You have to go back to the drawing board and make a fundamentally different decisions at the outset in order to fix the issue. 
---
Blizzard didn't cut costs and push out a crappy expansion. They tried to make Legion 2.0, but their fixes for the issues with Legion ended up making much of the gameplay feel worse. That's what's wrong with retail. Just bad design decisions where 5-10% of the playerbase feeds into a given area and then you can't ever go back because you'll lose so many people in the short term over those changes.
---
Why would you say your role is expendable/replaceable in raids?
---
Especially as a rogue? You can provide basically the best dps in the game as of the current phase. 5 rogues in a raid will do the damage of 8-9 casters. 
---
Fury warriors CAN do better but there’s not enough gear yet for them to keep up. And to be “expendable” you’d need 3-4 tank warriors and 8-10 fury. Not feasible for most guilds. 
---
If you’re talking about 5 man groups you still provide top dps and crazy utility in the form of stuns that can save the healers mana, etc among other things. 
---
It’s a nice sentiment but fulfilling your role best as possible is easily the biggest contribution you can make. Everything else you mentioned is something everyone should be thinking with regardless of role.
---
Flask of supreme power is 200g on my server.
---
You should uninstall the game due your ignorance of how pvp and mmo's work. Posts like this by low iq players is what ruins games.
---
Haha thanks. It finally completed, after roughly 24 hours :o
---
I have no sympathy for people who chose to play on a streamer server, let alone join a streamer guild raid.
---
I found myself on Allakahazam a lot too.
---
&gt; forum CM over how shitty of a spec enhancement
---
u clearly play horde lmao
---
I didn’t include a flask, this is MC
---
wouldn't mind class changing from shaman to paladin
---
5 groups is 200 players for AV. And these guys are going to play way more than your average player. Thats pretty impactful.
---
The bigger question though is if enough semi-decent premades show up to completely push out pugs. Even just having a half decent comp and discord gives you a massive advantage
---
To be fair to him, shit like that happens all of the time on Reddit or even in youtube comments.  
---
I was watching a video of a guy covering a song the other day. He looked a bit like a drug addict, teeth really messed up, really skinny, etc.  
---
All the comments were saying, "Don't judge him!" "Stop being assholes!"  
---
I couldn't find a single comment of someone making fun of his appearance. Point is that it does actually happen, lol.
---
This exactly
---
If they're all as whiny about this phase as thousands of redditors are, then yes.
---
That event actually happened. Look up tseric
---
Well the last few paragraphs do address that
---
If you think walking into there will be without danger, you’re gonna have a bad time. 
---
It won’t be as crazy as it is now, but that place always has activity. Even in retail you can see people going in and out of there
---
Alliance are holding up surprisingly well on Herod tbh. They often own zones, even own Hillsbrad at time. Azshara has been alliance owned like 24/7 as far as I can tell. Alliance raid was farming kills at the MC entrance for like a solid hour just recently. Alliance rogue gank squads are absolutely raking in the kills near Kargath and at the TM lake. 
---
Have a 54 warrior friend who cannot level at all due to constant alliance ganking.
---
Also in general they seem a more coordinated in Hillsbrad which counts for a lot. EDIT: Allaince absolutely CRUSHING horde in Hillsbrad right now. Total massacre. EDIT2: Alliance completely own EPL and WPL right now.
---
Sorry, but 2 parter: for the X X, is one the slot and one the weapon name? And do you have all of your other attacks macro'd to equip your sword?
---
I’ve seen 31/20/0, 30/21/0, 20/31/0 that will allow you to tank 5 mans and still heal raids. I play Priest Hunter and Paladin and the Paladin seems to have the most discussion and opinion on spec. For me personally I will be doing 20/31/0 so that I can try to AOE farm.
---
I’m currently level 41 and I put my first 11 in Holy with 5/5 Imp Concentration so that I could heal myself. I then put my next 21 points in Prot with 3/3 Imp Righteous Fury and BoS.
---
I don't think that's accurate. Blizzard still caters to the 1% as well just a different one. The 1% that clears ridiculously difficult mythic raids and competitively runs high m+ keys, they clearly aren't just trying to make all the ultracasuals happy (they're failing really hard at that by the way)
---
Turns out there's a crowd of people that wants to put a huge amount of time into the game but doesn't actually want any challenging content at the same time
---
Did you log in on launch day and think "oh my god there are way too many people the queues will never die down"
---
I logged off in Gadgetzan on my main. Haven't played since earlier today. That's because I'm on a PvE realm. Come join us. Leveling is the fun part, anyway.
---
That's just the thing - with cross-realm shenanigans, it doesn't matter how empty or full a realm is. The population is fluid. While certainly fantastic in terms of efficient use of infrastructure, it doesn't translate for a fun experience for the users, who can't identify with their players.
---
k
---
You don't even need a macro. Spy lets you click on the name and target, so you just cast mind vision.
---
So in pve servers is there a toggle if you right click on your portrait?
---
as much as i feel server pops are a bit high for the world pvp i sure as shit dont want to force every player into 1 bg especially not the most efficient one
---
people wanted world pvp some people are enjoying it let them have it
---
and there is not many different bg's let them come at the same time so people feel like they at least have a choice. if anything it should be av first then wsg last because all the people pushing will live in wsg
---
it amazes me that this needs to be said.
---
Ret Pallies will get the melee killed because they can be targeted by Wrath of Ragnaros. As long as you’re in cat form you are unable to be hit because you technically have an energy bar.

Congratulations to finding one of the nice, hidden places of WoW! :) There are several of these around, some in fairly logical places, and some in some less obvious places. Try to find some more without googling, and see what you can come up with! Can you find the secret dwarf farm, the random empty cave used in vanilla to spread a hoax about a bengal tiger vendor, the elf port with ruins or the scary dungeon with corpses hanging upside down in the water?
---
You messed up on the second line :/
---
Please define “people”
---
I haven't played retail in years and don't pay attention to streamers. All we knew about the size of servers was that they were bigger. That's it. So like I said no it didn't occur to me and I'm not leaving. I'd rather not play than play on a pve server.
---
Oh so we just get to make stuff up and not have to prove it. That makes this conversation so much easier. 
---
In vanilla the combat log told me their exact X Y Z coordinates so paranoia was an even better addon. Don't believe me? It's called google figure it out yourself.
---
And if you didn't figure it out that is what you are doing. If its so easy to find then prove what you claimed.
---
Let me just use this opportunity to say I rolled on a PvP server knowing it’d be a shitshow but I was hoping it’d be a shitshow for others and not myself and now I’m upset
---
*laughs in PVE server*
---
Lvl 60 can only receive honor from lvl 48+.
---
You could split Faerlina in 5 and still have 5 healthy realms.
---
Yes finding dungeon and raid groups is easier on a mega server. Everything else is way worse. The game world wasn’t designed for that many people.
---

Shroud was a top tier CS:GO pro player, and as pro players do, they sometime streams in their off time.
---
And then Shroud eventually got more and more viewers and turned that into his career instead and retired from CSGO.
---
Both at the same time. Zugzug
---
Not having fun on PvP servers because you can’t turn your flag off? Just quit instead of going somewhere where you can turn your flag off!
---
It’s big brain time
---
“Whiny” is a lazy way to avoid the actual issue
---
As a horde who is constantly plagued by normies camping Southshore, This makes me happy.
---
I never knew about the little horde outpost in southern stone talon on your way to sun watch retreat. Found it in classic.
---
Orc, I just got to the troll village.
---
i've been walking around with my combat log open in a separate window since i was level 40 in vanilla. is that cheating? i can't always see the rogue stealth with my eyeballs, but i knew he was there if i was paying any attention to my combat log.
---
don't get me wrong, i don't even use spy and i think it telling you co-ords of nearby enemies and shit is absurd, but just because you have better awareness than other people and don't need to see every action with a straight line of sight doesn't mean you're exploiting or something.
---
it's too damn orange tho
---
And to deactivate... /pve?
---
Or you could play on a PVE server carebear
---
you can certainly start brd grinding at 52 , it does not take too long , just do the right side till 54/55 then the rest for gear runs, high 50's start doing lbrs for fast xp
---
Just type /PvP again
---
Lmao well that sounds fantastic. Any recommendation on server and faction? I am thinking Ally.
---
"all its good at" is literally the majority of the game for many players.
---
You don't need a tank and off tank for rend runs. You really only need an off tank for 3 pulls in ubrs if everyone is appropriately geared imo.
---
Missing the relationship that grew through PvPing with the same premade group is considered self-absorbed? Do you even know what that term means?
---
They could. On release there were server stats for name reservations that fairly accurate server reports were based on. Afterwards, those stats became much more accurate and allowed even more power to the user to find the server for them.
---
The differences between Vanilla and Classic are being felt by everyone, so no edge there for any particular person.
---
Most people don't play this game all day every day, that goes for people clearing endgame content. The true 'nolifers' are a vast minority that has little to no bearing on this particular conversation.
---
Blizzard can only take so much responsibility. When they listened to players, we got LFR and Titanforging. Sorry, but you may want to reroll or head back to the Warfronts.
---
who's fault is it though? if someone wants honor they need to kill people to get honor, and currently that's what a lot of people want to do. before the honor was added pvp server's weren't cancer, it's just that a lot of players have nothing else to do except get honor
---
oh come on, those things are positively ancient. virtualization has its disadvantages, but performance isnt one of them
---
As a Texan, I want y’all to know, that’s not how we do justice in Texas.
---
So just screw all the horde on unbalanced servers that are already in an established guild cuz people don’t like world pvp. Pretty crappy solution. Also more queues is definitely not something blizzard is going to actively try to create so that’s a no go
---
I have sympathy for you all
---
&gt;Sadly this subreddit has shown mostly support for the addon
---
&gt;Anyone who dares speak favorably of the addon gets blanket downvoted and silenced from the discussion
---
Mein freund das ist doppeltes denken
---
Wtf this guy was in my guild
---
I think people just had a stockpile, waiting for the market to peak out, and when the market peaked everyone put there’s for sale, constantly undercutting each other. Realistically you should hold onto the stuff for another 4 months, or really until there are less people running it, therefore demand will increase the cost of the supply.
---
I don't know why people still pug with this guild lol.
---
The pvp pots will sell much better during P3... not really  a point to using them in hillsbrad... if you get frost nova’d, you die regardless.
---
You heard, em alliance!  Free HK coming to Duke Hydraxis in the morning.  GET EM

---
But hey, I'll tell you now. If you see a human rogue around named Neirbane, I'm not gonna fuck with you. You can come after me if you want, but there won't be a challenge to it.
---
Okay this made me burst out laughing and I’m a hunter main. Thanks for that!
---
It won't. The 1.12 av is just as boring as retail AV.
---
So sad we dont get the old AV like nost did for us.
---
Yea 100% people already waiting for BGs/quit.
---
I played on Grobbulus for a bit and was a bit disappointed with the level of rp that was there. There's just not that much.
---
I feel like so many people saw posts/comments about the server on here where people talked about how it's 50/50 balance and decided to create characters there to the point where it's much more like a pvp server than an rppvp server. You get people with completely non-rp names who openly shun roleplayers.
---
Doing a trp3 (a very popular roleplay addon) scan shows you that, compared to the total amount of people in ironforge or stormwind, there are only a handful of people who have the addon.
---
There's also the issue where a ton of guilds planned to roll on Grobbulus prior to the server's release with the purpose of trolling rpers and having easier world pvp because they'd be fighting people who joined the server for the purpose of rp, who might not be that great at pvp.
---
I didn't find much rp out in the world, maybe because most people were waiting until 60 to rp, but there is some rp within guilds and guild events. You just have to look for it.
---
Learn to play
---
It's been fun to watch everyone get hyped about classic then get bored. Now you understand my pain of playing from original release. A month is not nearly enough. Suffer as I have and know my anguish!
---
No one knew what they were asking for til they got it.
---
Also, this recommendation makes sense. I don't understand why they're making you suffer like I did. The content already exists. The classic population is dropping. Fix it. (Not that I give a fuck on a personal level since I canceled them).
---
Nelf priests have some pretty strong racials, especially if you're shadow. They get a spell that gives them +10% dodge and reduces ranged melee damage, which lets them just have their way with hunters, and they also get Starshards, which means they can still do damage if they get spell locked out of shadow by a warlock/mage/rogue/warrior.
---
Still doing the same thing I was doing the last two months before honor.  Solo/duo in moderately trafficked areas.
---
Got almost 200 solo hks today and got to avoid both sides zerg rush.
---
More fun, more honor.
---
Am PVP specced rogue though so I do have advantage.
---
You don't even need to do anything, you can just have any buff or aura on you while afk on a flight path, and you'll still ring. It scans things that aren't in our visible combat log too.
---
Thats me. 60 hunter, got some T1 and the rest is pre raid bis. No point in running dungeons, i have my epic mount. Logged on earlier for the guild raid today, then at raid time they tell me the raid is full with 2 hunters.  Gquit after that.  Shit pissed me off.  Guilds are too cliquey, atleast in my experience.  I missed one raid last weekend now theres no spot for me? 
---
Starting in a new guild is too much ass kissing. With no bg i think im done
---
IMO Hemo swords is easier to play. Hemo only costs 35 energy so it is easier to stay on a high amount of energy to use a gouge or a blind. It’s more difficult to keep enough energy when you have to commit 60 for a backstab.
---
Cellise, alliance hunter here, glad Daggerspine server blade is with someone who played on it :)
---
i saw a joke somewhere about forum etiquette on the early internet. people communicating like the person youre talking to is there, with greetings and proper grammar etc. compare that to twitch chat
---
It's always a minority. Reddit's users are only a tiny fraction of the world's population. If Battlegrounds were added today, the posts complaining about the death of world PvP would start. Most people probably don't have an extreme opinion either way.
---
They already do.
---
Yes, shame on me for not rushing through content I've already rushed through the first time around. HOW DARE I take my time and enjoy every zone and quest I missed back in Vanilla. Man, how stupid of me for sitting here trying to get value out of a product I'm paying for.
---
This.
---
I don’t know what you’re quoting, or what you’re talking about. 
---
As for 15 years ago, I didn’t play. So...
---
I'm on a server that is super imbalanced. I see your point... but honestly who cares lol. These people/horde with literally nothing better to do other than run around zerging us with benny hill music playing in my background wont stop without the spy addon.
---
When it gets to dumb I play an alt or use that time to reconnect to the real world and take care of stuff I'd rather be putting off.
---
We wait together warrior.
---
Jokes on them when the other side just stops logging in...
---
All this add-on does is take your combat log, filter names, put them in a nice window and attach /target macros to it.
---
That is spy in it's simplest form. It does not:
---
-spot stealth players in stealth
---
-show you where these targets are
---
-give direction towards the targets
---
-auto target/auto cast spells or attacks
---
-show any information on your minimal about these targets.
---
It comes with a kill on sight list you can add people to that will make a sound when you see them.
---
This add-on was also included in Vanilla, both before and after the add-on purge came through. Look up Paranoia, you can find it on legacy wow. It wasn't a problem then, the only reason it's a problem now is the other part of your post: the deathball raids endlessly killing for no reason other than to kill. It makes it nearly impossible to farm, quest, level alts, anything outside of a dungeon/raid or main city. You can't even take the boats in menethil or theramore anymore. There is ALWAYS a raid group hiding inside (which spy has not shown me multiple times before they rushed out and killed us).
---
This also doesn't detect any other humanoids, not display them ACTIVELY on the minimap, like the hunter tracker does.
---
Here are the details and the signup form of the event:  [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccuQ4Ii8XHWyisSm1MPaO6YYUX2fpUriUl2g3x\_FiyjtJEyA/viewform?usp=send\_form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccuQ4Ii8XHWyisSm1MPaO6YYUX2fpUriUl2g3x_FiyjtJEyA/viewform?usp=send_form)

* **elemental sharpening stone**: melee
---
* **dense sharpening stone**: melee
---
* **FAPs**: melee (you use them on the trash that can stun/knock back; casters are not in melee range and do not need these)
---
* **LIPs**: both (only used when you pull aggro off the tank, so this shouldn't even be on the list for a run such as this one)
---
I fail to see how "more than half of these aren't melee specific consumables". Just so that you don't try to respond with an argument about the price of melee vs caster consumables, let's go through a rough list of prices. I'll use US region average prices to make these numbers as relevant as possible to this subreddit (sorry EU).
---
* **mongoose**: 5g
---
* **elixir of giants**: 1g
---
* **winterfall firewater** (x3): 6g
---
* **MRP** (x8): 10g
---
* **crit stone**: 5g
---
* **dense stone**: 0.25g
---
* **FAP** (x4): 4.75g
---
**Total**: 32g
---
This is for a 30 minute run. It only gets worse in the average guild.
---
I'd be happy as well if I only got ganked that little. If I'm lucky I might get by with 4 corpse runs. And that's while being a slippery mage.
---
I was in this raid and the guild who hosted was actually &lt;World of Westside&gt; who looted it to their guildie who was inside Olympus in order to make Olympus take the fall while the guild &lt;World of Westside&gt; could get away with ninja looting 
---
(didn’t you think it was odd master looter looted it all to someone else in a different guild?)
---
I'd like to hear one good reason why mad people didn't roll on a PVE server.
---
And?  If they change something, you might be happier but it would make other people equally as unhappy.  The majority rolled on pvp servers without an accurate understanding of how this would play out, and I have some level of sympathy for that. But for people who enjoy wPvP, with all it's asymetric warts, this is a limited time window where we can have our fun.  I'm having a blast, and I'm alliance on Whitemane, which others have called unplayable.
---
Try playing a stealth class. That addons is the bane of my existence.
---
No guild needs a rogue, there are waaaaaaaaaay to many rogues
---
And he's playing the Zerg.
---
yeah you aren't very smart.
---
Exactly! Macros are a big part of WoW, so are add-ons.
---
Can you explain how the addon works for stealth classes?
---
Against warlocks I use a hemp build and open with a cheap shot 1-2 hemos and rupture then vanish before being seduced. Then reopen again
---
You gave up cause you got ganked twice? Lol.
---
I would really like them to introduce race changes, I would highly prefer to swap to night elf, had i known about half the time playing outside of dungeons/cities would be in death phase. I wonder if the 10% reputation gain from humans really is worth it over increased death speed?
---
Please stop posting.  You're dumb as hell.
---
That's not a great example because that's literally in the combat log. What Spy does is scan things that are not visible to the normal combat log, even with everything checked. Like pre-existing buffs/auras from before you showed up on their screen, meaning that you don't need to do anything in order to show up. You could simply have poisoned your weapons 20 minutes ago on another continent.

&gt;Complaing about not being able to farm honor efficiently
---
Skilled mend pet
---
&gt;We need to be honest with ourselves and own the fact that PvP was incredibly over romanticized from the get-go as being the "true vanilla experience" and It seems obvious now that vanilla PvP was nowhere near as combative as classic.  
---
I really couldn't disagree more.  PvP in classic is more one-sided, but is also definitely more passive.  Nobody fights unless they *know* they're going to win, unless it's a *huge* raid vs raid engagement.  I don't think I've ever been ganked by a solo player on classic unless I had ganked them myself beforehand.
---
My impression is that people were somewhat pressured to play PvP because it was often framed as the "right" way to play.  I'm one of the people who would *never* roll PvE, but that narrative was pushed pretty hard in this community.
---
In my experience, a very small percentage of players actually try to fight the opposing faction without having a numbers advantage.  Almost nobody ganked me when I was vulnerable if it was a 1v1, and I really couldn't depend on my own faction to jump in if I was outnumbered.  Often I would gank a horde player, they would resurrect and just leave.  Tons of horde would also just...attempt to quest peacefully alongside me.  On the same mobs.  Waiting for the same boss to spawn.  I would *steal their tag* on named mobs and they'd still...just wait.
---
I dunno if it's a real memory, but it's not how I remember pvp from vanilla (or tbc, or wrath).  It is aligned very well with my pvp experiences in legion / bfa, though.  It seems like it's just a play style shift, akin to the obsession with pre-BiS farming.  Players are just hyper-focused on playing "optimally", rather than just...playing.  PvP isn't "worth it" unless you win.
---
These people keep hating in the add-on who have never even used it, just assume they got killed so OBVIOUSLY it was because of Spy!
---
That's what I'm saying! It feels like a 5% dps increase to ABB when I was expecting more of like 10-15% or more! So far I have Onyxia and a dungeon run as practice. Maybe as time goes on I see that I low rolled my first raid with it.
---
Then you're facing some very *very* bad rogues my friend.
---
Aww did the big baby have to go and report my comment for hurting your tiny little feelings?
---
The second you saw an olympus member in the raid you should have seen this coming and prepared accordingly.
---
This is why I'm against the idea of Classic+. The amount of whining coming from the playerbase is totally insane. I guess my best shot is to try to experience as much of this game as I can before Blizzard caves to the whiners and ruins it.
---
It shows the coordinates of your position when the enemy was detected. 
---
If it shows the enemy coordinates, please screenshot and respond with the picture
---
Mage put up portal to IF behind the tree.
---
Texas, just ice.
---
That's the thing, still neck and neck with a dwarf hunter. I figured this bow would send me ahead of him. We were both pretty much in the same spot gear wise, but now with RD things haven't changed.
---
the hotfixes were from crap they broke when they ported classic from legion.
---
Tarren Mill guards were 45 in vanilla and not 55 like they are in classic
---
alliance racials aren't even that bad. gnome and dwarf are both good. and they have paladins which are stronger in organized group pvp like premades than shamans are. warrior + holy paladin is an extremely strong combo in pvp.
---
You can right click your characters avy up top of screen and enable it there too.
---
Like others said there's PVP happening on PVE servers as well.
---
Arena/Anger/ golem runs and build the group yourself. Level 53 to 56 with just this and I have all the pre raid BiS for 3 druid specs
---
Yeah wtf are people on about? My guild has had to PvP our way into Onyxia's Lair every time pretty much, and most MC runs we have to fight our way into BRM as well.
---
Are you horde?  I’m on Pagle and had horde attempt to raid ironforge and get crushed back to kharanos graveyard
---
Idiot. People will be continually starting this game for the foreseeable future.
---
How does this low effort meme make to 500+ upvotes but I post something genuinely original and it gets mod-fucked for literally no reason?
---
World PvP isn't that rewarding and makes no sense with the ranking system. Give us BG's
---
BG's are too repetitive and the constant-grind ranking system is broken. Give us Arena's
---
Arena's are too elitist and make gear too difficult to obtain. Give us Rated BG's
---
Everyone just sits in cities and queue's for pvp. It's so boring and factory-line, give us World PvP
---
Don't intentionally misread my comment to avoid my point.
---
This is it, just because the information is there doesn’t mean you’re entitled to have it.
---
Wait, so it shows the position of the enemy on the minimap and where they are located?
---
Oh no that's hunter tracking. This is just an add-on that pulls your combat log data and puts names in a window with a /target macros.
---
You should try using the add-on you are bashing before bashing it.
---
Half the time you won't get a notification until the player is already attacking you.
---
I just had an entire raid on the boat from menethil to theramore. Didn't see them until we were on the boat. Spy didn't tell me until they opened up (they were multiple classes, rogues, warr, sham, couple priests)
---
So again, it's wall hacks how?
---
Because "On their terms" will seldom be "on their enemy's terms". They want to pick and choose winning battles.
---
Because that takes way longer than just starting at thorium?
---
he's saying that because you said "a few years ago" when in reality it was about 10 years ago
---
Is there a addon that tells me the price of things on my servers AH? I have some things I want to sell but I'm new and dont want to undersell myself or overcharge and never sell anything
---
&gt;And I doubt any part of the community likes getting corpse camped by death squads that abuse an add-on?
---
The people defending the Phase 2 status quo are playing the majority faction and are at level 60 and are enjoying grinding honor as part of roving death squads. I think anyone saying otherwise is lying.
---
Spy addon needs to be removed the shit is so wack
---
So they want to be the ganker not the gankee?
---
Right you’re just seeing things from your perspective. Everybody was in the same situation with queues before, this would target specific groups of players. I guarantee no one would be happy to sit through extra queues, because some people are upset about being ganked. If they want to help pop balance they offer server only transfers to the other side for a limited time, dominant to non-dominant only.
---
That was a mature, level headed, positive response.  Get out!
---
/s
---
Man invis pots are not getting you far on that total run into brm
---
You realize 2 weeks of free transfers will fuck servers which is the point of this post?
---
Oh so it's your pet that's broken, not the add-on!
---
You see, when you target them as a rogue or a warrior, you can't just "send your pet and follow!" Because you have no clue where they are. Because the add-on doesn't tell you. See where I am going?
---
It’s not easy as a 52 Holy Priest. Getting to dungeons is a drag.
---
That's why i said everything so easy right now that it doesn't really matter too much. Most the criticisms on classes people have from pservers and youtube and the like aren't really going to be a thing until naxx.
---
nice
---
PvP on a PvP server?
---
ITT: The same fucks that raid-camp FPs and GYs in WPL and Thorium Point
---
Yeah I realized the first servers released were way over-populated so I waited. Then I did some research and made sure I found a server with pretty good faction balance. I rolled on a PVP server and made friends. We formed a guild that was focused on PVP. Now we roll around in groups getting in huge battles all over the world. It is fun as fuck and exactly what I was looking for. Honestly as a functioning adult with access to google this was pretty easy to accomplish.
---
https://imgur.com/a/jC2M2Kl
---
So 20% alliance log in, 20% horde log in, what happens to the other 60% of horde? If there’s no queues to begin with
---
he's trying to cherry pick.  It could be 75 yards and the addon would be useless.  The range would be longer than any classes damaging attack, so not harmful to any damage meters, and within eyeshot where, if you didnt see them coming it's your fault.
---
I’m on the majority side and I hate it. I’m just running around looking for alliance 90% of the time, 9% of the time it’s 10 horde chasing 1 alliance and 1% of the time is a good fight. BG’s now please.
---
Agreed.
---
You think you want WPVP......but you don't.
---
Where in God's name can I level as alliance at lvl 30 where horde will leave me alone? Seems like a shit time to be leveling now.
---
Leveling is like the first half of the game, but at the same time a complete game in itself. You'll easily get over 200 hours of fun content to do as long as you don't mind the slower pace of the game, but the leveling is absolutely amazing.
---
Every level you get, every new talent you get, every piece of gear you get, every skill rank you get, you really feel yourself grow stronger and can conquer the world better.
---
End Game in Classic is certainly a joy in itself, but leveling is an entirely great game in itself and you can truthfully enjoy the entire game without doing anything past level 60. Lots of people even spend time on their alts instead of working on their mains.
---
That’s whats gonna happen. The alliance on 70-30 or 80-20 servers will 100% reroll/transfer when possible. Literally, if world PvP is being 8v1ed, or running into a lvl 60 40 man raid that’s ‘pvping’ people 12 levels under them; there’s literally no point to playing on a PvP server. If these people think they’re actually pvping, they need a reality check lmao. What’s even better is the fact that eventually they’ll be a ‘rank 14’ pvper on a 90% horde 10% alliance server lmao. Like what? Congratulations (I guess). Ask them how they ranked ? And they’ll tell you, all you have to do is 5v1, 8v1, etc. and the best part is them being a high PvP rank on a 90-10 server lmao. Like, they’re not actually good at PvP. I bet they’d struggle in the 1400 bracket on retail in a fair fight setting. 😂
---
The best solution right here
---
This helped alot.
---
Depends what you are selling. Some of my things have been selling like crazy. One item in particular that I stockpiled would not sell and now that p2 came out the price exploded and people started buying. The thing is, p2 brought absolutely no changes in regards to that item.
---
those rose tinted glasses
---
The same way, the super manly chad "keep crying it's pvp just shove it" like you is also a minority. But damn, I hate that one
---
It won't be long before peoples stockpile run out, in a couple of weeks you will be able to sell shit again trust me.
---
I have already used about 30 of my 200 sappers, won't be long before i have to farm gold and buy more.
---
I don't have the majority advantage, and yet I am still defending World PvP. Why?
---
Because #NoChanges, that's why.
---
Of course, hearth is a spell, thus it appears in the combat log. Im not sure about gear, but I do think there are some classes with permanent active auras. Not sure though. Hence the question :P
---
Was he top tier before he started streaming? I thought he started earlier than that.
---
Depends on the server honestly.  All it takes is a couple of rogues in any zone to really make your life hell.  Like I said, if you didn't experience getting corpse camped you were on the side that had the imbalance in their favor.
---
Going to desolace to escape STV was 30 minutes of traveling to get met with the same shit around the kodo graveyard.
---
Lol not the thing to do on here. Find an irl connection don’t put that online
---
Hit 60 on my Heartseeker Shaman last Tuesday. 
---
Logged in today to see Alliance at every single Horde city, camping the Zeppelins, the flight masters, everything. This game is unplayable, so I just started leveling Alliance on Pagle.
---
Spot on. It's not the same experience because everyone uses Questie, googles BiS lists, and watches YouTube videos for tips and tricks. I don't think it's inherently a bad thing, but I do miss the time before everyone was spoonfed _everything_ right away.
---
Oh man it's super believable that you're parsing the dozens of lines per minute in a combat log with settings broad enough to detect rogues while actually playing the game attentively enough to spot the line in the log that "alerted you to his presence". I bet you were a part of world first naxx clear, high warlord and multi rank 1 too
---
You could spam /tar deadguy and should anyway
---
Did I complain or say I wasn't having fun? I just said Horde dominate in such a way I didn't expect.
---
Yes please die until bg! I need to farm some  matts
---
Bull. Leveling takes 6-7 days. That's nothing for 2 years
---
I've had the time of my life on a PvP server as the underpopulated faction.
---
Wanna do big battle PvP? Go to southshore. You can say there's no tactics but maybe you should try working with your raid to do some?
---
Wanna do something smaller and definitely more tactical? Look at worlddefense, ask in guild chat who is getting their flightpoint camped and roll out with a few mates. Stop whinging and fight back!
---
Back in Vanilla, there was an add-on called Paranoia.
---
It was the same as Spy.
---
The problem with it now is the deathball raids of people using this addon to wipe out and camp entire zones. And they're in basically every zone.
---
The add-on isn't the problem as much as the people are the problem
---
That, and these hate threads are always filled with SO much misinformation about the add-on.
---
I think they are trying to get at how OW relies more on cooperation and positioning than on an individual's technical skills, relative to the vast majority of FPS games on the market.  Of course you can still solo stomp in OW but you have to be insanely good or the enemy team has to be insanely bad.  It's definitely an FPS, though and RNG doesn't come into it (aside from who ends up on your team lmao).
---
So just like Gladius, which existed for years
---
Ahh thank you!
---
People complaining are just much louder than people having a great time.
---
No, and no one ever said you had to?
---
Hoe do you know they re good?
---
You said you’d rather not play than play on a PvE server. Seems like you’re pretty hurt.
---
Exactly this
---
Largely, myself and other hunters are finding our dps to be a bit up and down. Fights are too quick currently to get true indications.
---
If I have a string of crits I get a good parse without RD, one of our other hunters with RD might get unlucky and get 14% crit for the fight and drop well below me. It is hard to give a true indication without logs to look at.
---
And anyone who's not 60 is not good
---
Agreed that the wpvp before honor was much better.
---
Paid server transfer would be nice as well. Most people's options right now is to suck it up, transfer to a dead server, or quit.
---
You see again mate, a.) you’re being an asshole for no apparent reason? Would you speak to me or anyone out in the real world? No you wouldn’t, so reel it in and stop being a prick. b.) you are not referring to anything I’ve said or posted it in any way, shape or form? 
---
I do not want to play on a PvE server. I*hope* this helps.
---
Low effort troll.
---
Did you even look at the video with Asmon? The solution was to log out to another character.
---
And linking a clip of Venruki saying "get good"? A multi-time rank 1, PvP championship winner that has been playing since presumably 2004-2005 and has thousands upon thousands of hours in the game? Give us a break.
---
Do you not know who Venruki is or are you just pretending that what he did is something the average person is capable of? Even setting aside that the clip of him is a 3v1 and what people are stating time and again that they're having issues with are the 40vX gank squads?
---
Or do you know and comprehend all of this and are just being an ass to trick your brain in to making you feel good.
---
Those night elf’s have a black lotus spawn which makes it high traffic for farmers. I’d recommend sticking to the northern part of that camp. I tend to just come into it from the south and leave from the south.
---
Children love making others mad.
---
lol you don't know how computers work and btw we've been seeing loads of posts asking blizzard to fix their servers
---
Well when asmoron claps at jokerd ninja looting, what do you expect.
---
He was in Cloud9 for 2-3 years and won ESL with them, he only quitted professional CS:GO and went full-time streaming around 2017-2018
---
"Anyone that disagrees with me is a liar!"
---
wtf kind of mentality is that? Let alone for a video game dude
---
Yep I'm horde. The divide on pagle is huge. Something like 78/18. The other night post raid we came back to an org without bankers, ah, or flight master and about 25 horde just chilling on the bank roof
---
This add-on was in vanilla, what makes it illegitimate now? It has been around for 15 years, but is now an illegitimate add-on?
---
Compared to Dwarf it's hot garbage. They get Fearward, desperate prayer, and Stoneform. Being able to get out of Blind and remove Viper Sting is borderline broken.
---
I am so glad I rolled on a pve server. I just did the first classic raid-size world pvp in hillbrads, i loved it. It was just great, people defending their town, sending their guards, etc. 10v10 battles at 3am. And amongs this chaos, some lvl 30 were walking by, doing their quest.
---
My only regret is that you can lose the pvp mark after 5min, even in contested territory. Making it easier to wait and go spy or embush the other camp. It is supposed to be like this on pvp server, and even better. But boy, we knew it wasn't gonna. No one in pvp server is looking for a fair fight
---
&gt; OR horde players could have some decency 
---
I didnt misread anything mate.
---
Because it’s about awareness. You should not get a pop up that there are 55 alliance in BRM right now when you’re still behind the fucking wall in searching gorge. This is not the spirit of the game at all. 
---
People who defend Spy are so clueless.
---
Definitely agree.  Have been waiting for Honor since release. its a blast so far.
---
Got any other ideas being on a PvE server?
---
Exactly. Highly illogical and emotional response.
---
Ayyooo - I was Drunken Lords then Impulse, and had an alt Shammy in GRIM (briefly) hahaha!!! (Main was NE Rogue Nightcreeper, alt was Orc Shaman Spazzola).
---
You should not go 2-31-18 thats a big mistake. 17-31-3 is far superior just get 9% from hit should be incredibly easy.
---
But yes the bow isn't that massive of an upgrade. Its very fast compared which is a negative, but obviously it has sick damage still. There is some adapting to do as well for changing weapon speed, perhaps you are not optimizing your rotation idk
---
Havent noticed any lag so far
---
You were in a building, the building got rushed, and they found you hiding. It doesn't take an add-on to find someone in a building, they're not large at all.
---
No I didn't
---
Aren’t those dishonorable kills?? RIP their honor, shitters.  Sorry man.
---
Is it too late to start playing this game?
---
I RP deleted my post. Poster remorse.  
---
Its a form of RP PVP....
---
honestly, they need it.  If you're playing without it on a pvp server, you are absolutely gimped.
---
But I'll already be many weeks of honor behind : /
---
Cool.
---
Now pay attention to that combat log every single second you play
---
OR
---
Have an add on with a sound that does it for you automatically. And even a special sound for rogues and druids. 
---
Hmmm which one *feels* like cheating
---
This. If people want more fair or fixed game then retail is waiting for you.
---
Surprise element.
---
Nah, the ones who wrecked you were probably normal UC guards. If you were to try and take a zep as alliance, you'd have to go through lvl 55 elite goblin guards who have a ranged knockback.
---
If you were to take a boat as horde, you're fighting lvl 40 non-elites.
---
"why you mad bro"
---
The fact is you are making shit up and acting like its the truth.
---
Wasnt any skin off my ass. I was just afking post raid anyway. Hearthed to kargarh and flew to UC to take care of business
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
If they trinket the CS they done goofed.
---
What a dumb idea. Leave reddit go play gw2
---
while not for me a lot of people waited a long time for world pvp
---
there are people enjoying it , i know its pretty toxic on some servers but i dont think blizz should take it away by patching in bg's 
---
honestly servers are over populated if half the people on every server quit its likley for the best 
---
i also dont want to need to spend all day in a bg till after Christmas
---
level 40 is the earliest u finish a skill tree so yes classes get alot more powerful at that level. and i agree so much with the low level are, people will sometimes flock u like u are a hero :D. but then some ask for gold... WHICH I GIVE
---
Lol did you play vanilla?  It was EXACTLY like this, and it was super fun.
---
I had trouble copying and pasting a paint kit description on a forum once, Spanish paint company and their black is 'negro'.
---
Listening to the minority that is both vocal and sucks at the game is how Blizz ruined retail.
---
Oh I get it, gosh, I am learning so much.
---
so you're...complaining?
---
&gt;Fury warriors CAN do better but there’s not enough gear yet for them to keep up. And to be “expendable” you’d need 3-4 tank warriors and 8-10 fury. Not feasible for most guilds.
---
This really is not true but rest is.
---
Fury warriors with full on prebis do way better than prebis rogues, hell even geared rogues. And you do not need more than 1 tank MAYBE one offtank, the fury warriors can do the rest of the tanking.
---
Are people not understanding how these deathball raids work? You clear EVERYTHING and kill what you find. See a building? Clear the building. See a corner? Clear the corner. See an enemy? Kill the enemy.
---
You don't need an add-on for that.
---
&gt; I haven’t played retail in years and don’t pay attention to streamers. All we knew about the size of servers was that they were bigger. That’s it. So like I said no it didn’t occur to me and I’m not leaving. **I’d rather not play than play on a pve server.**
---
https://i.imgur.com/Q409gZL.png
---
homie, no need to be a dick. you can set your combat log to only show enemy player actions. give it a shot, it's helpful.
---
No one here will buy it and most sites with scam you.
---
Pass it on to a real life friend.
---
It's more hilarious to see you first-time players who don't realise what you signed up for with a PVP server. You had 2 months to get to 60, get geared and find a guild - if you couldn't do that then you're simply bad at the game. If you dislike PVP and think you need a "fair fight" then cancel your subscription or change to a PVE server. Not sure what you expect when you join a PVP server and complain that you are getting killed. You can disagree but this is how vanilla is, it won't change and it has existed like this for 15 years so no amount of complaining is going to stop it. Leave now or shut up.
---
As someone currently leveling a NE in 50+ zones on a horde dominated server I feel this a bit too much.
---
That does seem to be the general attitude.. I think it boils down to "this addon makes the game way easier for me and I don't want it gone".
---
And frankly that's pretty sad. It negates things like stealth (you know.. major part of several classes and their balancing) as well as using terrain to stay hidden. 
---
Personally I think the best solution to it would be to separate all enemy player actions to a second combat log. The WoW client would interact with it the same way as it does now, so you'd lose nothing when it came to visual cues and actually finding/laying eyes on your enemy... but then there could be heavy restrictions on what information was passed to the *player* combat log (and therefore addons). All without breaking any addons like DBM and such that rely on the combat logs.
---
Why not just dungeon grind the last few levels? Not like you'll have any problem finding groups and the xp in late game dungeons is really good.
---
lol classic never required skill and retail always had more going on for it. 
---
the only people who think classic takes skill are people who barely play it. like 90% of the classes have 2 button rotations
---
I remember using a once o ly quest reward to summon a felhanter for gnomer. It wound up making the difference for killing the final boss Haha
---
Neat object but I can't find it on wowhead
---
Spoken like a true nolifer.  A lot of us went hard 15 years ago and are now adults with jobs, family, and kids but looks like we all suck because we didn't rush 60 so we could grind all the gear and complain that the next phases are taking too long.

The trick is to go there at 3 am and kite the burning steppes demon south to the enclosed mountain region. I did 3/4 of the demons with ease on Wednesday night in about 90 minutes after getting my leaf Tuesday night, but then Silithus took about 2.5 hrs since I could not find a lock and a bunch of horde kept ganking me during the fight. Good luck on your journey of getting Rhok'delar!
---
It's more likely the fact that too many players probably called their characters a version of that with racist connotations, and Blizzard got sick of constantly renaming people and added blanket rule for convenience. 
---
Basically Blizzard's way of saying that you can't play nice with that word, so you don't get to use it at all.
---
How so? It shows you their position on the minimap, like track humanoids? It lets you track enemy NPCs? Hunter tracking is much stronger than you give it credit
---
Im sorry you're upset
---
OH sword spec procs as well
---
I dont care about tos if im quitting. That's a given
---
Demand is higher for tanks and heals, so groups can't be as picky. Whereas with DPS they can be selective. And without major aoe dps, rogues have some serious competition
---
Eh every raid in the history of WoW was cleared basically on release unless there was some kind of issue making an encounter impossible in which case it was cleared as soon as it was fixed.
---
Is he doing a better job rotation wise?

Only true authentic DookeyTM yetis run as fast and as clean. No other brand will do.
---
no
---
I’ve rolled on pve, but probably because of friends.
---
You must not know much if you think blizzard is going to suspend them....
---
You cant speak the truth here youll get downvoted to oblivion, ive been saying this for ages and people still think nax is going to be a problem kek please lfr on retail takes more skill then any classic raid all you do is spam 1 skill and watch out for 1 mechanic shits a cake walk in 2019
---
What server?
---
No one will buy it if they can potentially get banned.
---
Auctioneer will show you the latest prices based off you scanning. The first scan takes a while (roughly 45 minutes based on my latest alt), but gets progressively faster the more frequently you scan (I try to scan every time I'm in a major city). This gives you access to historical pricing data as well as current expectations, even recommendations on what to do with an item (ie, vendor or auciton) -  [https://imgur.com/a/oAvUbE5](https://imgur.com/a/oAvUbE5)
---
Honor from launch would've been hell for anyone not leveling at the speed of the 1%.
---
God I love looking at the comments from 05 on just about every wowhead page
---
Because people underestimated the sheer terror of 5000+ socially crippled manks roving the countryside like a mongol horde giggling to themselves as they completely destroy your ability to play the game. I don't understand how anyone can find world PvP in its current form fun. Also, I'm horde on a horde dominated server. PvP for me is rushing to try and get a Mind Blast in before the ally member is killed.
---
Somebody give me one good reason why the 'no changes' crowd hasn't yet realised that servers with 10,000+ people on them is already a change that has had massive consequences for PvP.
---
I'm a level 54 NE hunter on whitemane (horde favored) and I'm not complaining. This is the unique MMORPG experience I wanted.
---
Don't speak for me.
---
For the winning or losing faction? There isn't really much to do if you're in the losing one.
---
&gt;Might only be my personal experience, but as an Alliance on a horse dominated server the majority of my friends already threw in the towel and are just raid logging now(Just like Retail).
---
The queue times don't back that up. Seems like a lot more people are logging on right now.
---
That's literally how PvP has been since classic wow released.
---
I think you're seeing your in-game "accomplishments" and seeing that they don't translate into IRL accomplishments, which is true.  But that's not really the point.  It's a game like any other game.  
---
If it's causing you to ignore your IRL responsibilities then it's an issue, but if you'd be spending that time doing some other recreational activity then it's the same as anything else.
---
So what about shamans/paladins? Are they just left behind when their guild switches factions?
---
Bruh you have no idea wtf youre talking about. You have no idea why i quit or what my motive is. Shut the fuck up
---
I’m a rogue. From safe fall I can do the two jumps with out healing and have half health.
---
i do think pop is a huge factor , the developers have said it was designed for a small population , think the sort of server where you know most of the people on it 
---
not to mention the resource spawns 
---
im fine with p2 and im sure plenty of people enjoy the shit out of it but still feel it would be better with 50% of the pop on every server
---
and not phases they suck dick
---
i can see that but it seems pretty silly considering its so popular nowadays, blind justice is cool but maybe not when its done by a bot
---
the exact ban is for 'abusive chat' which as a proud Alliance member i cant speak for but i dont believe is very abusive
---
hell, just 5 minutes ago i got some [Abusive Chat](https://i.gyazo.com/4405581680dd3ff312ee4ac7e76ef432.png)
---
I'm not assuming anything. From what I've seen of horde, they are dicks. And like I said, I can't speak for other ally. And I'm not your mate, buddy.
---
Every single video, thread, outrage, whatever? It's boosting his channel.
---
I don't understand how people can't see this. There's almost nothing major left to do right now in game so streamers get their name out by being associated with drama.
---
Blizzard has already said that the ML gets to hand out the loot how they please and if you don't like it don't run with them. People joining a guild run with *many* known ninjas who have faced zero repercussions being surprised by having things ninja'd seems odd to me.
---
Don't play with these people, solved. They aren't looking to help you.
---
Nothing to see here. Just another bunch of Hordlings who'd gladly drive all the Alliance off their server. Then complain bitterly that there's nothing to kill so they can't rank during phase 2.
---
If you have anything else to add to the list, let me know and I'll get it added in!
---
I still think vanilla world pvp in this phase was amazing.  There are so many things that are different now though.  Servers are much bigger, addons like spy, the guy wasn't anywhere near well understood, there were way fewer people out trying to just farm honor and don't even get me started about how bad population imbalances feel when there are so many players on a server now.
---
fights seemed pretty fair in numbers guess you must be ally ;)
---
I have a 51 warlock. Same. Man I wish I didn't slack off before the honor system was out so I'd be 60 or at least 55+ before it lol.
---
You linked a bluepost from the era of layering, of course they permitted more people to be logged in concurrently because they were all divided amongst howevermany layers they needed. They never said they were changing the number of players from the original game *on a single layer* unless I missed the biggest breach of #nochanges to date. They also never said they expanded the number of concurrent players on a single layer to be larger than that of Vanilla.
---
The most annoying thing about WPVP is that 48+ give honor to 60's. In what world can a 48 fight off a 60? Why are honor kills not 5 levels +/- ? it would give the lower levels players some breathing room. and by 55 they may have got into some dungeons for pre-Bis so they can actually contribute and put up a fight.
---
You are wrong on both counts. 
---
* No `SPELL_AURA_APPLIED` event fires when a warrior resurrects. 
---
* Enchants are passive auras. They do not appear on unit frames and they do not appear in the combat log.
---
How the hell are people complaining about this? You think it wasn't like this during real Vanilla? I'm here to tell you that is absolutely was. I was there. 
---
You idiots need to make up your minds. Do you want Classic or not? Just be honest with yourselves and say no. There's no shame in it.
---
What about Paranoia? It's the original spy from Vanilla, spawned into Carbonite that lasted until Cataclysm and even Legion iirc
---
It did the same thing. How did it make it 15 years without being banned?
---
Yeah seriously people are acting as if week 1 conditions are permanent. A lot of people (myself included) had some fun for the first few days in hillsbrad/other high level zones but now have gone back to our usual activities, just with more PvP
---
Orgrimmar. Straight north of troll village. You'll come across razor hill another orc village but pass right on through
---
Time to roll low level rogues to run into aoe from other players to lower their honor so I can rank easier
---
I'm a rogue. I can always tell the players that have spy by the sudden panic attack they have and the constant spamming of AoE trying to find me. Key word "trying". It's fun to watch their mana bar drop while I circle around them. Just when they think they scared me off, I hit them with a distract and start the panic all over again. Usually what happens next is they try to mount up, again "try" is the key word because that's when I sap after that, well, you get the idea. 
---
tl;dr Spy add-on stops nothing
---
I can give you a few
---
1. I didn't think phase 2 would come this quickly, I thought I could hit 60 before it launched.
---
2. I didn't realize server population caps were going to be so much higher than the original servers, nor did I realize all of the negative consequences of that.
---
3. I played on a PvP server in BC and loved it and thought it would be roughly the same. I honestly had no idea what the honor system was and what a terrible system it is.
---
And this is coming from someone that doesn't really regret rolling a PvP server, I'm just hating phase 2. I'm lucky that I'm on the dominant fanction of my server, but even with that, being in the low 50s means I'm constantly getting ganked. 
---
PvP servers are fun. Phase 2 isn't.
---
For real though. I don’t kill Horde herbalists and they don’t kill me. Unless we meet on a lotus spawn, then we rip each other’s throats out.
---
Yeah, I don’t know why I extend my hand to the reddit mouth-breathers. It’s not worth the effort. The rage replies are entertaining though.
---
Yeah, sure. But horde are the ones driving the servers to extreme population imbalance and singing about it, so prove me wrong...
---
Also would like to know this. I'm a holy priest with 300 tailoring and 260 enchanting and I'm nowhere near able to get my epic mount, truefaith vestments, or even able to finish leveling my enchanting because I feel perpetually broke T\_T   
---
And no, my gear isn't good enough to solo DM lasher farm, so what da heckie do I do
---
everyone has spy installed we know how it works
---
lol just dont use any skills or anything that shows up in the combat log amd you are totally invisible
---
so just log out yeah?
---
tbh im fine with it because apparent its true to vanilla but i dont feel like it increases fun
---
I think part of the problem is that players don't know what they want - and the rest of it is that Blizzard doesn't know what they want.
---
One thing I don't think many people appreciate is just how much of WoW's success is owed to the fact that it just worked. Back when WoW was released, it was fairly common for games to have system requirements that made them unplayable for many or to have technical glitches that made playing them a frustration. The original waves of graphical MMORPGs was dying down because their graphics simply weren't up to snuff any more. WoW managed to deliver a solid aesthetic experience on minimal hardware where you could actually play the game.
---
Certainly, it helped that it capitalized on a pre-existing brand. But the popularity of WoW was never really about the fact that they had a particularly good set of mechanics underpinning it or a solid understanding of how to construct an effective world.
---
In a sense, it's rise was similar to Facebook. It's not that it was *good* so much as it was popular - and popularity bred popularity. If you're going to choose a social media site, you choose the one where everyone is. The same with a MMORPG. You choose the one where the people you want to associate are - and once WoW took that lead, it never really relinquished it even in the face of all sorts of arguably superior competition.
---
So now we're at the modern day. What the players want isn't really Classic or Vanilla. What they want is actually a 'fixed' version of WoW that takes out all of the bad stuff and leaves the good stuff intact. Except no one - not the players and not the developers - really know which is which.
---
Nope.  Not 60 and not a stealthy class.  I just knew what i was signing up for when i rolled on a PvP server
---
People who do not know that Spy was around in vanilla are clueless.
---
The add-on existed 15 years ago, continued to exist until legion.
---
Go check out Paranoia, it was the same thing then. Crazy how there aren't multiple threads complaining about it on the retail wow subreddit!
---
Just to be clear, the xp is not the same as it was in true vanilla right? Leveling seems wayyyy too easy. Especially in dungeons.
---
All I read was, get this addon and your epeen will grow 3inches.. That's double my normal peen. Thanks for the tip tho. Ill be adding this to my addons.
---
Do the Horde really have no repair NPC at the Bulwark?
---
I remember alliance and horde battle circles where you would have 1 v 1 from horde and alliance while everyone else watched.
---
By playing with them
---
Fear is great lmao
---
Can do: Exist
---
Can't do: Be fair
---
the higher ping doesnt bother you? I originally rolled westcoast by accident and decided to reroll at 20 on an east coast server. Didn't want to be at a ping disadvantage for important things such as interupting heals
---
Absolutely. Some of my favourite memories were literally standing behind a tree as 40 allies ran past literally 3 feet away. In a world with spy we might as well be playing on a flat plane with no obstacles
---
It's Horde only, basically to allow them access to the instance without going through a super long and potentially difficult journey through Loch Modan and Dun Morogh.
---
does opening a trade window stop skinning the way it does opening chests?
---
Quick question - 
---
I want to transfer to a PvP server with my brother.  Seeing these posts makes me hesitant, though.  Is it really so bad?  I'm trash at PvP btw lmao
---
Hasn't been laggy since Thursday for me on Whitemane.  Other than some random incidents even southshore has been lag free.
---
Lol I literally learned about this addon from bitching posts such as this. So, like I told the last on where I learned about this app, thank you for the exposure. Me, and a shit ton of other people who were previously unaware that this magical app existed, truly thank you :)
---
It is fair, because everyone can get it
---
Maybe you didn’t donate enough money to your streamer god to get loot?
---
Especially at this point when they've shown over and over and *over* that they will ninja and not do a thing to stop it.
---
Joker had an actual company that was in charge of him. This is just a cult fanatic of Asmon, as far as I know anyway. It still deserves the outrage, but I doubt anything will happen unfortunately.
---
Yep, this was the cause. Another tip is to wait a few minutes before respawning, just in case you are still on someone’s spy list from before your death and they are clicking to see if you’ve rezzed.
---
Of course I can. Spy works by reading the combat log and throwing up a notification. It only notifies when a rogue or druid ENTERS stealth while in range. If I enter stealth out of range of your add-on, you never get a notification.
---
I would kill for that kind of experience, haha. Usually it's questing and a warrior charges in, which should be easy because I'm a mage. However, shortly after that charge comes the raid and I just let out a quick sigh as I get ready for the corpse run.
---
Honestly, that one I'm fine with but the 15+ deaths to get to BRD is just ridiculous. Takes me an hour or more to even get to the dungeon. I can see horde all along the path from TP to BRD waiting for people to rez.
---
*laughs in PvE realm*
---
Common guys someone answer this desperate man!
---
Oh man, this makes me feel so bad!
---
Because it's not hard to level?  It's nothing but a time restraint. Are you trolling or dense?
---
Little late for that now with 6+ days of my life invested.
---
I would disagree with your first statement. There is a reason I included the list of things it does not do as the amount of times I've seen "I was stealthed and this guy ran right up to me!" or "IT SHOWS YOU COORDINATES OF THE ENEMY!" is more than I've seen for posts that actually acknowledge it existed in Vanilla.
---
I don't think it's made to "increase fun" as add-ons are just made to make what you do easier. It doesn't increase YOUR fun because you may die, but the guy in the deathball raid is probably having a blast.
---
It's all based on who is using what and how they are using it.
---
Special Olympus strikes again.
---
ok ally
---
That doesn't make it fair play.
---
Go back to retail now means to go to a game that takes more skill. Classic has devolved to a state that takes 0 skill and encourages only logging for raid night. Community is dead now and we are left with a less skillful version of BFA. Might as well play retail, as you earn ranks in pvp through skill, not 40 man camps.
---
They'd have taken it and given it to guildies from the run in IF after the fact.
---
PuGs for these guilds are just there for numbers, they have zero intention of handing over any gear.
---
we are pretty much on the same page for our weaving/rotation.
---
i guess to me the 00s are the "early days".. lol
---
Oh so it existed and was never used which is why it was built upon with Carbonite? It was around for over 15 years, it was obviously used.
---
Well that's kinda one of the downsides of WOW. You want to do well then you've gotta put in a lot of time. If people are short on time then falling behind is expected and comes with some massive drawbacks. This is why I'd never recommend PVP for people who can't, at least, dedicate a week to grinding 60 straight away.
---
53 paladin, haven’t logged in since Thursday.  Can’t quest, can’t dungeon spam.  Might as well get that rested xp for now
---
Man do I really have to find the blue post again where they said they won’t do anything... how about you try google before saying if something is true or not. You’re spreading false information.
---
No ones earning rank up in 40 man camps because thats garbage honor.
---
Yeah used by less than 1% , u obviously never played vanilla
---
Wouldn't it be nice if Twitch required a stamp of approval signed by your employer verifying you work full time before you can signup to be a streamer? The world would be a much better place.
---
These clowns in their basement that are so toxic and slimy they wouldn't last a week at a real job.
---
You're right. Prayer of healing is a useful spell when the priest's group is taking consistent damage since it otherwise takes too long to cast a bunch of Heals on them. It has a good niche. But my original point was that it's ludicrous to think that the gap in effectiveness between bringing a resto druid healer instead of a priest is comparable to the difference between a boomkin and a fury warrior. You don't need that many prayer of healings in the raid to keep things under control.
---
However if the raid's priests are mostly spamming flash heal then the raid would be better off having more holy paladins instead since flash of light is much better at quickly patching up small hp losses.
---
I mix it up based on mood and other things, but I’ll typically do coffer runs pickpocketing mobs along the way in and out, and killing fire elementals. I can buy Relic Coffer Keys off of my AH for at or less than 30s each, and the ROI is every bit of double that in the coffers alone. 
---
You can throw in a grim guzzler run and kill the bartender, and/or kill the pyromancer boss that is “behind” the arena. BRD has a ton of options for rogues.
---
The only annoying thing is pickpocket resists+vanish bugging out. That corpse run is no joke.
---
&gt; Funny because this blue post from 2005 says otherwise...
---
well, did the game get better and better?
---
Fortunately we're pretty balanced here, so if you get steamrolled by the enemy faction, just wait a few min until your faction steamrolls them.
---
0 time = 0 skill
---
You need time to be skilled
---
Factually though, It is "game play". its just game play you don't enjoy....numnuts.
---
my mind is blown by this thought process that because your having a shit time blizzard is responsible and needs to fix it for you.....fix it yourself, YOU stop playing or YOU REROLL, instead you want to punish other players by making them wait in que's.....You shouldn 't be able to dictate what happens to other players just because your getting camped
---
&gt; They don't know what they want.
---
LMFAO, are you for real? This is coming from the same people who were told "you think you want it, but you don't." Ignoring everything else, how can you actually be okay with this level of hypocrisy?
---
If the mob of casual players "ruins" the game, I guess we'll have to ask if the game was actually that good in the first place, won't we? Whether it was actually an experience most people wanted, or if it was driven by nostalgia?
---
Retail or Classic, this sort of arrogance doesn't belong. Stop telling people the same shit you condemned Ion for.
---
It's revered yes... Was much more rare to see in Vanilla times.  I had maybe the 2 or 3rd one on my server back then.  Certainly one of the most detailed parts of the end game ever added in vanilla.  However... In classic it's now super common place and has lost it's prestige by a lot.
---
Honestly I'd say get blastershot launcher and use that for style points.
---
Fark off.  
---
Sure my server has more Horde than Alliance.  
---
But I'm playing a bloody Prot Warrior.  
---
I die to every fucking thing that remotely wants to kill me out in the open world.  
---
And you know what? I don't fucking complain. Because this is what I signed up for when I rolled on this server, this class, this spec.
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
Go north to north east of the flight path, no lotuses or silversage there.
---
People made the same stupid argument for using the command to show enemy HP bars 144 yards away. "It's not banned so it must be legit." Spy is bullshit, you know it and I know it. Stop defending it you look like an asshole.
---
Shadowmelt
---
Sure. Link it?
---
Me and my friend ( both lvl 29) farm honorkills in tarren mill by just tagging the enemy and working with the lvl 60s by baiting alliance. In just one day so many fun things happened (mostly goofing around while roleplaying as machos even tho we are lvl 29)
---
It depends on the server, but yes, it really is that bad. I would suggest you wait a while until things calm down, or until battlegrounds are released.
---
Blizzard has always stand a passive attitude on the in-game community, and always with an old mindset about how players are.  I mean, Blizzard let players to freely pick their choice, but it's probably fine in 2005 when players were new to the game.  People leveled up slow. It took me 6 months to hit 60 for my first rogue, and only take 3\~4 weeks nowadays even I have a job to do.  And people didn't know what classes were better so they random picked a class, sticked to it even on a weak faction which doesn't make the weak faction weaker.
---
But It's 2019 people have informations much easier, most wow players are heavily experienced and know to avoid disadvantages. People know what classic and races are better, know what addons can gain advantages. If people found they are alwasy facing pvp of 1v10, "ok I'm fucking out of here", it won't take much long time to hit 60 again in a stronger faction on another server.  Yeah people may say "Don't like be ganked? Go to a PVE server", but we are talking about the server balancing of the game not whining about the personal expericence, if this keeps going every server will be 10:1 or 1:10 in the future, so that's good healthy status quo of a MMORPG?
---
Players have grown up but Blizzard still think they are noob kids. What Blizzard can do is to decide what game content to release like battlegrounds and more raid dungeons, and limition on character creation in dominating side. Many PSs can maintain a good faction balance (without adjusting any gameplay content) and Blizzard still mess it up.
---
thanks for the clarification
---
Oooh okay yeah now it sucks. Sorry dude.
---
The real question I have, because I have not reached a level to enter that place yet... 
---
Can we use aquatic form in the lava? If not, how can we petition to make this a reality?
---
You are also a former hardcore arena ranker who plays a rogue on one of the TWO faction balanced PvP servers.
---
Basically, your very unique circumstances make phase 2 work for you, so you've made 5(!!!) threads in a row telling everyone else ("casuals" as you so bitterly call them) they're shit out of luck because your experience matters more than the majority's.
---
And this is why you are not in charge of making important decisions. :)
---
If you lack time to level how would you have time to develop your skills?
---
Not a priest but a shaman here. I was in the same spot as you, but then I picked up herbalism and learned to solo maraudon (tinkerer+princess runs). You don't need great gear and as far as I'm aware priests are better at it than shamans anyway. 
---
Didn't bother with selling boosts and reseted instance on my own alt so had to wait 2mins for leader to swap over every time. Still managed to get near exactly 5 runs per hour.
---
You can find tons of guides for it on youtube I'm sure. :)
---
I'm referencing your attitude, not any screenshots.
---
Waiting? No I'm participating. Once in a lifetime opportunity.
---
It's different gameplay that isn't 100% to my taste, but endgame has been stale for a while. So I'm enjoying it for the limited time it's around.
---
&gt; I rolled a PVP realm, sure, but never expected the release of the honor system to cause me so much grief.
---
That is the quintessential vanilla experience.
---
We had to abandon our level 60 characters and move to Elune
---
&gt; &lt;Honor System Refugees&gt;
---
Is this the texasjustice from Executus?
---
I think the biggest impact is for the level 52-59 people that are still trying to finish leveling.
---
As a level 60 I can go PVP crazy if I want to in one of those roaming groups anytime and enjoy that.  The only downside is that getting to an instance (especially BRD/BRS) has become a major pain as you roll the dice on which large raid group happens to be controlling the mountain.
---
Aside from that it’s business as usual.
---
Go to bed at 11pm. Wake up at 7am. Work out, breakfast, whatever you do with kids to get them ready for school, etc. Work from 9am-5:30pm. Get home at 630 or 7pm. Dinner and spend time with your kids, maybe help your kid with their homework. Get kids in bed. Maybe by 9pm you're free, and if you want to spend any time with your spouse then you aren't going to play WoW today. 
---
That's your standard day. Literally everyone I play WoW with who has kids is busy before 8pm, and more realistically 830/9pm, then they can play a few nights between then and say, 1030/11. You can make a raiding schedule work, and maybe you stay up an extra hour on tuesdays/thursdays. But most people with a family can't commit 2 hours a day, every day, for a month straight. It's more like 2 hours a day for two evenings of the week.
---
I was proud of my 1-5 on gnome wl opening day in 35 mins
---
So because YOUR guild didn't use it, it obviously wasn't a big deal.
---
You can still sneak. You can still hide. Just recently a raid of horde hid on the boat and camped it. Spy didn't say anything. 
---
AV isn't even out, how do you know people will not be able to sneak around? They can sneak around now. Not to mention, rogues are still a thing. It can't see through stealth and auto target them.
---
Before p2 everyone was afk in IF/Org checking auction every now and then. Now it's kinda hard to do so when you're out there farming honor.
---
Totally off topic but what add on r u using for your extra action bar?
---
The hard part is getting invited to the group
---
*Are you the guy from the Warlizard Gaming Forum?*
---
&gt; ... this is what world PvP used to be.
---
No it's not. That's the problem.
---
As I said Sentry existed in Vanilla and did exactly what Spy does now.
---
On opening day I was one of the first 3 people to level 12 and I didn't feel one bit accomplished
---
This game isn't that hard man. All Pve rotations are well well known. Plus while leveling, you even have less shit to do...PvP is definitely a little different But were talking about leveling here. Its A time sink and hardly Much more.
---
Took me a few seconds, you funny man!
---
Can we say the raiders from Texas are dumb?
---
Appreciate the thoughtful reply. 
---
I see your points. Also I rolled in Krom when it was a new server popping up. It just filled up like the rest of them. 
---
I’m gonna gut through this murdering and just accept it as the “hard mode” of playing alliance over horde. 
---
I can’t imagine how much better it would be being so deep all the time. But I also can’t stand the horde aesthetic.
---
People that have a clue don't go hillsbrad though. They're not a majority, but they're also the ones more likely to use consumables in pvp at all.
---
Start the group, it's easy
---
I've been contemplating it... I'm only mid 30s, so I go back and forth between it getting harder from here out, and me being behind the curve so maybe it will get easier if BGs roll out before I get to high 40s? Eesh.

I've been doing UBRS the last half a dozen times with only one tank, all the runs have been really smooth. You sound competent so I bet you could main tank it or solo tank it no problem! 
---
Honestly, the only tricky part is a few pulls near the last boss. Most of the add's can be CC'd and blown up so there really isn't even a need for two tanks.
---
Blizzard's original plan was intended to leave servers with populations that were comparable to retail. They expected half the playerbase to quit at level 15. Now that they see it isn't happening, they have been trying to retroactively correct things with the free transfers. The fact that players are unhappy about the overcrowded pvp zones should be pushing people to transfer.
---
If things don't realign, will they eventually have to add more realms or possible implement forced server splits? Yes. But fixes are a process, they don't happen overnight.
---
Clearly it's not a bullshit add-on as it's still in the game. Not sure what to tell you buddy.
---
It’s just a vertical bar that you can turn on in the settings menu
---
Google petopia.
---
That site will list the info you need.
---
Basically abilities like claw/bite will come known on some specific pets. You will need to stable your current pet, then go tame a pet that knows the ability you want, then after a handful of fights with that new pet it will announce that you have learned the ability it had. It will then be in your book to teach any other pets that can learn it just like growl is.
---
Petopia has an abilities page that will list all the pets that know each different ability and each rank of each ability. So there's a bit of a mini game going on with hunters of having to go tame these to keep their pets up to date. 
---
I believe bite is better, but i think most people just have claw and bite on auto for a cat pet.

Famous last words...trust me...

Clearly it's not a bullshit add-on as it's still in the game. Sorry buddy, not sure what to tell you.
---
The guide walks you through best route of leveling and you can have the option of duo trio etc when starting it but I have only experience with solo and it does give you elite quests to do sometimes but I feel like that is up to your discretion to party with others right. I am using solo for alliance warrior now and it is working well, I do recommend grinding around to stay a little ahead and you can also supplement dungeons for when you don’t wanna quest. The times I skip some quests elite or boss whatever it works out fine
---
Spy+Mindvision=I'm gonna find you.
---
True to vanilla in the sense of that it was available back then? Sure. 
---
Did the majority of players use it back then, like now? Nope.
---
I'm level 40 and having a blast :)
---
cheers to you  ALIVmo
---
Nobody is mentioning the soul stone requirement too.
---
&gt; Yup, because they do something about it instead of just complaining on forums
---
What the hell are we supposed to do? We are massively outnumbered in every engagement and as soon as we do start to win it's like they send out messages in LFG because their numbers seem to increase 2-3x. We don't have enough people to put up a fight.
---
&gt; You can try to categorize it in a special way that fits your narrative
---
It's not my narrative, it's literally **the** narrative.
---
&gt; It's all PvP at the end of the day, and if you don't enjoy it then PvP servers might not be the place for you
---
I don't understand how you cant get this into your skull. I enjoy PVP. I do not enjoy hours worth of corpse camping. No one does. You don't. And that's is all that's happening on my server atm.
---
You're nowhere near the quest area for that in this pic. No one's pvp raid is going to Dun Garok. Just go out the back of Tarren Mill, run past the level 40ish, semi-AFK fisher and you're home free.
---
Depends on who you ask on reddit.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
. I dont have to do the math myself when others already did the math and made 1000+ guides. I am superior in a sense that i can play the class better than someone using expose armor in dungeons. Stop using buzzwords
---
You’re right
---
It changes nothing
---
It doesn’t tell you that there are X amount of players in the area so be alert
---
It doesn’t tell you a rogue or Druid stealthier nearby
---
Everyone has been using it for 15 years 
---
Jesus Christ the classic community is 99% sperglords autists. Go to war defending a shitty add on cause you’re bad at pvp
---
&gt; I expected pvp but this is just stupid.
---
Should be the motto of every pvp server. I learned my lesson in retail. PvE all the way now
---
You’re amazingly funny. Keep going. Please. I’m loving how much of a jackass you’re making yourself out to be.
---
Srsly... horde has murder squads at every corner of the world on sulfuras..not even a lil fun right now
---
Just gonna throw numbers out?
---
74% of all statistics are made up on the spot, you know
---
It shouldnt be a bad feeling. You put it back up after for 1c less until someone buys something.
---
Love your keybinds.
---
I'm having a blast with world pvp.  Didn't ruin shit.
---
Why tho
---
Outland before that and later Argus
---
Most of us made it.
---
We don't really know exactly what the Q times mean, except being able to compare them from Tuesday to today. Prior to tuesday layering drastically increased server capacity, so we don't know what an 1000 person q now means in terms of player population compared to an 1000 person Q 3 weeks ago. 
---
The only comparison we can make now for Q times is to other Q times from after layering was removed, for all we know there could be a huge overall player drop since then or it could be the exact same
---
&gt;would they have to be convinced about making it
---
Yes they most certainly would. In any publically traded and multi billion dollar company you need a business justification for everything. You need so many approvals before you can even start analysing whether it will be worth it.
---
You can't just listen to a bunch of people online. You have to think about your shareholders, employees and of course customers
---
It's a far more involved decision then flipping a switch and saying "work on it". You need to shift people, prioritise projects and it all needs to align with what the execs want to achieve.
---
I'm willing to bet it wasn't that simple to build classic because they needed to make sure it integrated with their current systems. I can't imagine any PO would've signed off on something which took double the amount of work to keep running
---
To get high level bites and claws you have to tame new higher level of beasts that know them and use them with that new tamed pet.  Eventually you will learn the new level of bite or claw and be able to teach it to whatever pet is valid to teach it too.
---
You can have a cat with bite and claw if you wish, but technically bite is more bang for buck damage when it comes to pet energy.
---
At first your pet will be full on energy and will bite and claw... Which is a nice burst of damage... So having both does have a small perk.
---
Sounds absolutely miserable.
---
There's a big difference in a name popping up instantly within coming into your radius on screen and being target able, and having to scan your combat log and make a target macro for them.
---
An example would be earlier today i was in a cave farming ore, and a name popped up on my spy so i clicked it, could see he was targetting the mobs above the cave i was in and i knew I was safe. Another example would be i was entering another cave and got a notification, so i clicked the name, saw he was targetting the mobs I just went by so i knew he was behind me and managed to turn the camera fast enough to see where he was before he vanished, then open on him.  
---
People defending this addon by saying things like "Oh you can just scan your combat log all the time like i totally did 100% of the time before i knew about this addon" are being incredibly disingenuous. This addon is a 100% must have for everyone because of how much is does that nobody could realistically do with any efficiency otherwise.  
---
I understand you can't break it or remove it with the combat log the way it is, and I've pretty much come to accept it's going to be around for all of classic, but acting like it isn't incredibly powerful is silly. As a Horde rogue, the targetable name even after I've vanished, combined with perception from a human means 9/10 times, I'm about to be hit out of stealth.
---
Younger millenials are so lame that you can't even create your own terms, you just steal and redifine them.
---
I don't honestly know.
---
I've seen claims, usually those saying the add-on is broken and needs to be removed, saying it's 100+ yards but I've stumbled upon multiple enemy players without Spy activating and when I hovered over them, they popped up in Spy.
---
Good luck passing nonstop combat logs

STEALTH DETECTED BEEREEEEEEEP
---
clearly OP is still leveling or hasn't been 60 for long since most guilds were only logging in for raid before WPvP came.
---
Yea honestly this issue came up when I was thinking/writing this post. This is a very tough one. The obvious solution would be to allow shaman-&gt;paladin class change. Then you ask what about the gear, then it becomes even more difficult when handling non tier sets. Then you have talents, etc. Most importantly you have a player having to play an entirely different class if their guild swaps (making it less likely that any one single guild fully takes a faction change option). It's a tough situation. As I stated, this is a bandage fix to a much bigger issue.
---
In fairness, if you run raids with Olympus after all that has happened you kinda bring this on yourself
---
But does anything happen while in stealth
---
Xrealm battlegrounds... So will we have the original battleground system where you can see which bg you're joining (thus allowing xrealm premade groups - like QQ Premades and Proudfather Airlines on bloodlust) or is that exempt from #nochanges
---
Youre full of shit, vanilla was nothing like this at all.  There's 5x as many people who are 5x more coordinated and min maxing way more
---
Smut Peddlers
---
The downvotes are because you couldn't perform a simple Google search to find the information you asked for, but demanded someone find it for you. Just FYI.
---
No skill required with this addon
---
The add simply reads the combat logs making you more aware of them. I doubt you'll get much sympathy as the classes crying about it are the same ones who gank everyone when they are half health fighting 2 mobs. Banning thos add rofl than they better get rid of DBM and im sure you use that which does way more.
---
Only a handful of servers were layered prior to Tuesday.
---
Mine was not, and we are definitely seeing higher queue times compared to last weekend.
---
Nice job losing your mind about "streamer man bad"
---
yeah, it's pretty good. people still try to exploit whatever they can to get ahead, but that's how life is.
---
I have Spy, I don't use the tracking features at all. I use it to record PvP scores and add people to my gank list so when I see them again I know to avoid or ambush them. Basically just a glorified notepad with character names and kill counts. If there was an alternative, I'd love to use it, but I can't find anything.
---
Only having fun when you are winning is such an American concept.
---
The real fix would’ve been to disable character creation on the higher population faction once it exceeded a certain threshold.  
---
Blizzard didn’t take any preventative measures to try and stop faction imbalance at launch so why would they change things now?
---
Almost like Blizz added pvp as an afterthought in a PVE oriented game
---
Dying on the boat isn't too bad. You rez when you reach the other zone and have a second or two before you can be targeted.
---
I run with 2 other people in World PVP.  3v30 sometimes..still having a blast..we just usually run away when we're outnumbered by that much.   Most people run in big groups because they are indeed bad at the game.  And you also get next to no honor.
---
lvling is honestly not as bad if you do dungeons. At 44+ just stay in ZF till 53, then try your best to crawl into BRD, then stay there till 60.
---
Everything before 44 is pretty easy since people don't want dishonorable kills for killing poeple too low lvl.
---
Obviously playing 3v3 Arena in retail takes more skill.
---
Classic is and has always been a DIFFERENT game
---
Don't like it, don't play it.
---
You will need points to train the abilities though, on your pet page you'll see at the bottom what it's at. These are gained by raising it's loyalty level i don't know the exact mechanics just use the pet and keep it fed. Those points you'll spend on teaching it abilities.
---
I solo tank as fury prot using shield when needed but I usually keep aggro on most every mob aside from whelps on rend. Your roation of all 3 shouts, tclap and ww seems pretty bad, just BT one, Revenge another, sunder the next until all have been hit, spam tab sunder and revenge on CD. 
---
Otherwise some people just suck at tanking and pallys don't have a taunt so they have to actually be good at their class, he wasn't clearly.
---
Should be able to test the distance if it's basically doing the same thing that a dps meter does, by seeing how far the meters pick up damage done by a group member
---
There isn’t one
---
Pvp servers were incredibly fun until thursday hit.  Now they totally suck
---
Nay
---
Yeah so it will happen with higher frequency as soon as phase 2 hits, but will go back to being extremely rare once BGs are out.  I played vanilla 15 years ago too - this is simply not a common occurrence under normal circumstances.
---
They should release 1 BG in December not both.
---
Similar, 52 rogue
---
Rogue seems obvious.atm but once bgs come warrior seems like itd be thee msot fun/wanted for premades
---
If that's how you use it, that's how you use.
---
I've also seen warlocks and hunters saying they use it and send their pet to attack and just follow them in. Only certain classes can benefit from these abilities. 
---
How would a Warrior, Rogue, Druid, Shaman, etc. benefit? Certain classes have advantages with some aspects that others do not get. That's what WoW was.
---
What's even more OP is I usually mind vision folks that the Add-On warns me of, so I can see where they are hiding and hunt them down. I can also chain Mind Vision - Target Spy - Mind Vision over and over to figure out everything that is going on and update my part. I feel like I'm cheating.
---
You can filter your combat logs to only display what Enemy players have done within the detection radius of the combat log... You don't know enough about this to have a valid or a correct opinion.
---
You can see Mind Vision as a debuff. That would've been clever of him, but no they just stormed through the catacombs till they found my corner.
---
MECHANICAL YETI.. just because

More like OLE PUSS amirite
---
Is there a source? Never heard this was the case.
---
The people are doing what they want. If they want to transfer, then that's what they want to do to enjoy the game. If people are relentlessly farming people for honor  in a very inefficient way, then that's what they want to do and they should know the transfers from that are because of them so that's what they must want, or else they wouldn't do it. Giving incentives for low factions will absolutely not happen and the free transfers are the only viable solution for classic
---
Someone who remembers what it used to be like. Roll on a pvp server if you want to be the faction that outnumbers the other, THATS IT.
---
In Texas, we dish out justice by usinYEEHAWWW
---
Vanilla servers had like 1/20th of the population these servers had lmao. Very few people ganked constantly and the ones that did made names for themselves.
---
*Laughs in dwarf warrior*
---
What do you think world pvp is? Pistols at dawn? It's always been this way. It's an RPG not an esport. If you don't like it you have no one but yourself to blame.
---
Its pretty much him saying "They think they do but they don't" which is just incredibly ironic
---
Warrior is so overplayed though
---
The thing is, you can't humanly detect 20+ players instantly once you are in range, and get a quick summary of their class and level distribution, and have a targeting pane. It's really a completely different level of automation compared to manually /targetting and scanning.
---
Chained Essence of Erranikus.
---
Lol you had months to get to 60. No one feels bad for you.
---
I am a orc warrior and have trained fist weapons. Say whatever you want about that but it's not showing up under my Weapon Skills.  I can equip a fist weapon but cannot use it. It's as if that hand is unarmed. Is this a bug or am I missing something?
---
Edit: Also to note, when i equip the item it does not appear on my character.
---
A month ago from today is October 17th which puts launch at about 7 weeks prior.  Average time leveling to 60 is 9-10 days played, so let's split the difference at 9.5 days or 228hrs, which over 7 weeks is 32.5hrs a week or 4.6hrs a day, everyday, for 49 days straight.
---
To me, doing that sounds way less relaxing than hopping on for 1-5hrs a day when I can and taking a bit more time to hit 60, but to each their own I guess.
---
As long as healers aren't running out of mana during a fight, utility &gt; dps. If your group is pulling mobs way back to the point where they can't possibly run into any other enemies, then don't bother, but otherwise, it's a nice thing to do to any runners.
---
yep, isnt fun when you dont even stand a chance. Wonder if they could fill their servers differently. Decide what  a good ratio variance would be. Say 60/40 to 40/60. When one side hits 60 then no more of that facyion can join. When it dips below 60 then people can join.
---
It's super fun when I stealth up to a drinking mage for the big ambush crit and his spy goes off and he starts aimlessly AoEing rank 1 spells so I can't get close to him. 
---
Without spy he'd have no idea I was there.
---
Yeah the fact that I know there might be a rogue around entirely changes my behaviour. Maybe I'll just run away, fast than stealth. I'll get my back to a wall, and shield up (as a priest). Basically is game breaking in my advantage.

There was a raid of horde hiding on the boat between menethil|Theramore.
---
Spy did not inform any of us until they attacked us. Saying you cannot hide is just wrong. You can still hide. 
---
&gt;The Spy add-on just makes the game too easy/automated.
---
You can say the same for threat meters, DBM, any auction house add-on, any quest tracker, any postal add-on, auto-junking add-ons...they are there to make the game easier.
---
For our raid last week, we had our rogues scout the path ahead before the raid entered so we knew which entrances were covered and which were free. They were there for about 10 minutes before the raid rolled up and we got in with no deaths (other than screwing up the jump) 
---
If you think scouting doesn't exist, it's because you're not doing it.
---
Position doesn't matter much when you can use your map understanding to deduce the options to 2-3 places that are not visible, or simply see the visible player that has been detected. Not to mention your pet can walk towards them to instantly narrow down the options.
---
Like I said

Good luck parsing your combat log

This isn’t a hard concept

This is about as stupid as defending the auto run way point addons. 
---
I mean, I could just auto run to those places right ?  Why can’t I have an add on do it for me ?
---
You know i can look at my fucking combat log and do the exact same thing this add on does, right? Gtfoh
---
If this addon is stopping you from being successful in pvp, you’re the bad player.
---
They're both awesome. 
---
Hemo gives you more control over the fight as the ability is less energy, which = faster combo points. Plus other abilities from Sub tree ( Setup, Premeditation &amp; Dirty Deeds).  You can constantly get 5 point Kidneys or Evis before the target can even move. Both, when you get down your stunlock, blind, re stealth, open up again with CS technique. Also You don't need to be behind the enemy obviously, so its easier to navigate. You'll eventually get Preparation which is a super strong ability. Resets all  rogue abilities. Another round of, Blind, Evasion, Vanish, Sprint etc. You Can literally stunlock someone for ~20+ seconds. THEN at ~55 you toss Cold Blood (garuntee crit) into the build from Assassination tree.  Cold Blood on a 5 point Evis is OP is Classic. Hits very hard. 
---
Daggers have bigger burst but lack the control. But that's OK because the idea is to Critical Ambush and BS something super hard to either 1/2 shot em or take a massive chunk out, then you go to work with your blinds, vanishes to open again with Ambush. 1 shotting clothies is awesome. Rogues are dirty, we pick off stragglers drinking or behind the pack. Or the Priest in the group. 2 shot em then Vanish the F out and your group is ahead. Downside to daggers is big Bois are a problem. Warriors, Shielded Shammies and Bears are kinda brutal. Pick your fights.
---
 I'd say Daggers are much more fun to play from the massive bursts and 1 shot potential. Theyre both fun as hell because you're a stealth boi regardless.
---
If you want some build suggestions just holla. I played a bunch in Vanilla and TBC
---
whole lotta mad round these parts lately
---
I have very little time as it is, 48 will come a bit later. I'll stay in my little bubble at Arathi Highlands, pvping for a bit then dungeon grind when I wanna move on.  Kinda waiting out the storm or maybe BGs open up sooner than we think ya know
---
Rank 1 AE costs 75 Mana. A 60 mage has 3k+ Mana. Maybe more, I don't play a mage. They're not spamming it every GCD, they're not running out of Mana anytime soon. 
---
If you get a bad mage that's spamming his Max rank AE then yeah, he'll go oom and you get a free HK. But that's not the case 90% of the time. 
---
I'm ok with spy, just not ok with the stealth detection aspect. It gimps rogues, we're pretty worthless without our CDs and openers.
---
Ow is an fps the same as fallout is.

Ow does not require precise aiming on most its characters. Its the the 1st person people are debating you on, but the shooter part because its not the core mechanic.

Why would a top streamer need some “real job” if they are already making more then what you bring home at your “real job” don’t get me wrong I work at a “real job” but this comment is just straight asinine. Don’t be the toxic clown that your talking about mate.

You can call it whatever you'd like, but it's clearly available now in Classic, it was available in Vanilla, and was available throughout Legion.

I play alliance on Skeram. I get skullfucked everywhere I move, but bitching and moaning to blizzard is exactly why retail is the way it is. It caters to the lowest denominator player.  Figure it out.

All this sub does is piss and moan about the game they desperately wanted. You’re getting wrecked because you’re just not that good or don’t have time to play. That’s not blizzard’s problem and they don’t need to cater to you. Maybe you’re not the target demo of the game anymore.

Upvote! I’m commenting because I can’t not upvote twice.

Why does the Combat Log even need to show Stealth calls in the first place?

That it detected someone entering stealth...?

You do know your combat log tells you that, right?

That would be fucking terrible for twitch. They would lose so many streamers and so many eyes on their platform. Use your fucking head man.

Sure, but that's not what I'm saying in the slightest. Have A good night.

It's unarmed skill
---
tell that to Skeram Alliance lmao
---
It was never available in Vanilla actually. But yes it’s in Classic and it won’t be removed so I don’t understand why you’re so frightened.
---
Should really level as arms I think would give you much more pvp survivability
---
What are you on about you get easily hit 25 without leaving safe zones as alliance. Westfall and loch modan for questing require zero trips outside your safe zones. As well as a little thing called deadminea and stockades. 2 dungeons that will take you to 25 easy.
---
I'm still here homie. Are you still pretending to be a badass?
---
There we are, thank you. People tried so hard to find a way around it, but ultimately Blizzard made a solid decision back then
---
Honestly I could give a fuck about battle grounds, I'm just waiting out two weeks or so so the immediate push for rank dies down a tad. Roaming raids are crazy lol.

They seemed to do fine in Vanilla with Paranoia (vanilla spy)
---
running around.

Thx lol, I'm really new to this game so everything was kinda confusing at first, but I find keeping the keybinds organized based on utility helps.
---
I am horde on a horde dominant server and it sucks because after the first few days there are no more alliance to kill anywhere. You may get one good fight in somewhere but as soon as lfm channel finds out the location 30+ show up and we roll alliance and they leave.
---
Because of your level. When I was 47 couple days ago, unless I attack, horde literally ignored me while leaving my surroundings riddled with higher level alliance corpses. 
---
When I dinged 48? Camping, ganking, griefing.
---
I mean may as well make use of it if everyone else is. If it doesn't make you feel good though then don't use it.

The amount of time I’ve spent flying back n forth between WPL and BL is disgusting Lmaoo. And when both zones are fucked I have to go to my alt lmao

What is ranged melee damage? Aren’t those mutually exclusive? Do you mean physical damage?

Depend if solo or not. Every time we get a divinity drop, 10 persons of the guild go to farm the eye for the priest. Take around 1h to drop it.
---
Few things maybe. 
---
The Add on Spy is super lame. But if you're just sitting there and not doing an action that gets put on the Combat log, you'll be fine from Spy, I think.
---
Warlocks with their tank pet have better stealth detection.
---
Another 60 will see you if they get close enough. They also hear you, the stealth sound gets played when youre in sight.

If you don't have abilities in the Sub tree for lesser detection, you'll be seen as you have been

I'm not sure if it's true for every class, but multiple classes can get something special at level 40. For mages for instance you can get group teleports to Stormwind and Ironforge at that level.
---
I'm all good with removing these add-ons that have existed since the beginning of time.
---
Stop acting like a complete idiot over a game that requires no skill then.
---
Honestly I wouldn’t mind the gank squads as much if the corpse runs didn’t take so long. 
---
Rogue camping the fp at Morgan’s Vigil? Gy is all the way at Flame Crest.
---
Hell no I don't but you sure sound like salty bitch posting about the state of the game when you don't play it.
---
Correct, and most servers are horde dominated.
---
So nobody using this add-on has died and makes you amazing at pvp?
---
I should add that to the list!
---
&gt;I'm all good with dictating how other people play the game
---
Yikes.
---
Put them on the neutral ah n they will sell. Alliance doesnt have the option for a good fishing pole until the fishing event comes out
---
No changes
---
I thought I would be safe having only gotten to 56 before P2. I was horribly wrong.
---
In my experience, I use PvP in cities where either someone is in a building or right in front of me. I can now know that people are hiding or res'd in an Inn, for example.
---
Maybe? Idk why they'd bother breaking an addon that isn't a problem.
---
Yes that's basically what I'm saying. I thought it was disengenuous all these years for them to try to claim they put effort into it too, as it stayed an afterthought always.
---
It's a good change.
---
Wait so Paranoia wasn't in vanilla?
---
You act as though they started on Herod. They recently moved here, those asshats.
---
&gt; matters more than the majority's.
---
Honestly, no one knows for sure what the majority opinion is.
---
All that's really known for sure is that the people who're having a bad time are *really, really, really, loud*
---
I'm not really a dev, but I would say because all of the abilities show up there, it's very robust. They likely dont want to start a line of what is and isnt too important for the enemy faction to record, or they could end up justifying the bar every time a meta shifts. 
---
Instead it's just everything, so no one has room to complain what is and isnt worthy.
---
Everyone loves the *idea* of world PvP.
---
Almost no one likes what world PvP actually becomes when left unchecked. ie: ganking, griefing, camping corpses and flight paths, and just general douche-baggery.
---
As someone who plays Horde in classic (although on a "more balanced" server), it's really sad to see how much people who decided to pick Alliance legit can't play at all on PvP servers.
---
It feels like warmode at BFA's launch, except it's worse because you can't "turn pvp off".
---
I main alliance in retail, and I know the feeling. I rerolled Rogue so I could at least pick my fights (ie: pick the 1v2s instead of the 1v10)
---
Alright, alright.
---
Have you considered the people on 70-30 realms can't do that? Wish I could
---
I don't need to know politicians to know rich people bad.
---
Hey, thanks that's really kind of you. If things don't improve and I go that way, I'll reach out. :)
---
Then you lose the attacking advantage and put yourself at a disadvantage.
---
If you do something and it is picked up by the player's combat log, their name will appear.
---
If it were just logging in, why didn't Spy pick them up before they attacked us?
---
Totally agree with this. To add: I think they were also too stubborn to admit that they had turned the current state of WoW (retail) to shit via releasing classic
---
It’s not that it isn’t casual enough. It’s that there’s no skill or fun involved. It’s either an aoe spam fest 100 person shitshow, or farming 48+ like they’re a mob. Neither is compelling for anyone.
---
If you need any help (bags, guild etc) PST/mail me in-game (Thiril).
---
PVE servers that way --&gt;
---
I call this piece, "La Horde de Capitale"
---
I'm not afraid to admit I thought I did but I didn't.
---
Same, unsubbed until BGs launch. I don't get a lot of time to play and I spent two and a half hours tonight running back to my corpse while trying to quest.
---
Shameless plug, I love bloodsail Buccaneers. I haven’t encountered any of these PVP problems that have been mounting in the sub, people are really nice and awesome on the server. I believe alliance heavily out numbers horde tho. There are rating girls and even PVP groups. I made an awesome girl, I have loved it since day one.
---
Edit: Even if you don’t role-play, it’s an amazing server. I haven’t role played in 15 years but it seems to weed out the negative toxicity that comes with the genre
---
How did u make that calculation?
---
If we assume Vanilla was until BC prepatch then it lasted from 7 November 2004 to 5 December 2006 which is 114 weeks.
---
BGs released on 7 June 2005. Thats 7 months or 30 weeeks since launch. So over 25% of Vanilla there was no BGs.
---
We had Classic for 12 weeks now.
---
if you want to speed Classic up 3 times then looks like we're having BC prepatch in May 2020...
---
Tell me your mains name. You’ll be gkicked and blacklisted by tomorrow night
---
If you think I’m kidding go ahead and try me. When you play 18 hours a day and run multiple discords your tend to meet some guild leaders across different realms 
---
I have 4 accounts and I am a guild leader across 4 different servers. You have no idea who you told to “git gud” you pathetic wage slave. 
---
Fucking try me you insect. TRY ME
---
Ha. Just saw you use Android and Spotify. What’s it like to be poor ???
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Keep moving those goal posts.  If you move them far enough even you can score.
---
Afaik you can't lockpick ubrs. I have 300 lp didn't work last time I tried. Diremaul, start scholo you can lockpick.
---
Players are definitely way more hardcore these days.
---
It’s time like these where I see the origin of ilvl dungeon finder restriction shit. People spouting all sorts of bullshit who didn’t play or were too young or whatever to really experience it.
---
That doesn’t mean those of us who did are the only ones who are allowed an opinion, but when the very universal consensus that SS vs TM Zerg crap was stupid but a required devils bargain until BGs. This seems to have been “forgotten”, and those same forgetters don’t get that this idiocy with camping FPS and lowbies will be terrible for the server in the long run.
---
I played on the WORST ratio server in Vanilla, according to Blizzard, and we could wipe the horde anytime we really wanted to at Tauren Mill but then PVP was over for that day several hours etc. my only hope is that people wake up a bit if they’re in the dominant faction and play more responsibly, but given the population sizes I guess that’s a long shot.
---
I saw someone on Rattlegore Horde  doing this today too.
---
The lowest estimate I've seen for an average player is 8 days which would still be almost 4hrs a day.
---
If you are still lowby 2 month after release you are not an "active" part of the population.
---
They probably don't want to compete for drops. I've downed emperor with a group of level 54s and only using CC for the elementals. Did a mostly full run (skipping prison) in ~100 minutes.
---
Not true.
---
I'm sure I could find one, I don't care to though.
---
You're grasping here, trying to say "not a single person in Vanilla used paranoia."
---
Obviously a false statement, it definitely made an impact as it was around and used by other add-ons for their version of "Spy/Paranoia" 
---
Carbonite, for instance, used Punk, which basically did the same thing.
---
Oh I didn't even realize that lmao. Yeah it's been a slow grind leveling up, I dont have as much time to play and ever since phase two I've been dying more often, but the PVP when its against someone around my level is quite fun.
---
If there's any add-ons that are pretty good I'm open to suggestions from people too! I'm only using like 2 or 3 rn.
---
Thats why i said ubrs key.
---
This is just what happens when you put a 2019 gamer mindset into a game that was designed with a 2004 mindset.
---
Back then, there was a similar addon, the difference however was people's knowledge and desire to maximize their advantages.
---
Today's average player will absolutely go for the most effective choice, regardless of how much it "breaks the spirit of vanilla" - and who can blame them, it's part of the game, its a tool that is completely legitimate, its not even a morally grey area, it's there so you can use it to make things easier for yourself.
---
I don't personally use spy, even though im horde on a pvp server, but i'm not gonna trash people for using the tools at their disposal because at this point, spy is as much part of pvp as engineering is, everyone has access to it.
---
I think you're missing the point, though.  Nobody finds this fun.  It is beneficial to their character to farm the honor from killing you.  Sure there might be more efficient ways to farm and sure it's not very meaningful early on in the honor system, but a lot of people are feeling it out to see where they can rank and what it's going to take.  You're kidding yourself if you think they're having fun in the traditional sense.  It's more of a grind with a reward than a fun activity to go do just because.
---
Bgs are cross realm lad.
---
Bro do you need a hug? I have free hugs. Come here.
---
they break spy,they break the combat log and countless other addons...its a risk they more then likely don't want to take.
---
*cue laugh track*
---
I agree, and so does blizzard.
---
a lot of add-ons were removed in Vanilla because they were too good.
---
You could have an add-on auto run to objectives, auto heal and auto decurse the raid, all with zero input from the player.
---
Those are what I would consider game breaking add-ons.
---
Yeah it is. A friend ignored my bank alt a while back and then couldnt talk to me anymore. Had to have my buddy PM him
---
&gt; so they can feel good about themselves.
---
So they can farm honor, nobody cares about your gameplay experience, it won't make me happy nor sad you are being camped, is just honor
---
What's the point in having phases if you aren't going to stick to your phases

---
God I hope they still remove it. The addon goes against everything Vanilla stands for and gives bads like you an unfair advantage. You’re so scared of losing it because you know you won’t be able to live without it.
---
52 should be able to get really quick XP in plaguelands/winterspring quests
---
eh my side is at a disadvantage and im level 49, but having fun. ive got the old school pvp experience
---
Currently doing this rn. I’m at death 10, and I think 3 more should do it. :)
---
Thought for sure this was going to be the “Remember to go outside Azeroth with your friends” one.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
I think world PvP and ganks are alright as long as the people doing the first attack aren't more than a couple levels higher at most. Singular enemies actually being a threat makes pretty much any gank an instant success if the person you are jumping isn't red or above. Success meaning they either die or would die if they opt not to run away.
---
Oh is there a Druid tank staff better than warden? I’de love for you to show us.. lols
---
Hunters get a bow staff and quiver. Quit crying
---
Game launched 11 weeks ago, 77 days. 184 hours. That's not 4 hours a day.
---
That's the solution.
---
Like you've got any stats so the opposite, so let's just stop with that line.
---
Most people go by anecdotal experience, and I distinctly remember ganking people from behind a tree in vanilla when they ran by within spell range. One of my favorite movies because they'd be confused for a second where it came from.
---
I was able to do this once in the second week of classic, it was glorious. I've tried it a few times since then but people either run in the opposite direction or just try and tag me as I'm tagging them.
---
There are many ways to gank dude, it's just that non stealth classes have lost the ability to jump someone from behind terrain. Now I just ride at them with Max mounted speed. No point in subterfuge, just a direct attack. And that sucks that my playstyle is limited in PvP because of this addon.
---
If it was a non stealth class, then that line about spy not notifying you is complete bullshit, and if it is, hurr Durr, that has 0 bearing on the discussion at hand (that spy ruins surprise attacks from non stealthers)
---
They are the reason we have retail.
---
You said “feral Druids” now you want to narrow the goal post to exclusively staves for exclusively tanking bear Druids?
---
World PvP was not like this in Vanilla. OP's statement is still true.
---
Just spreading the information. I'm not wrong either, the add-on existed in Vanilla. It's a big issue now for some reason. If you think wpvp is ruined because of this add-on, then you're bad at wpvp.
---
Tanks are the hardest but spam for 10 mins. Unless your server is reallly dead
---
&gt;You are a literal child.
---
Take note, everyone. Usually comments like this are overcompensation to protect the writer's own fragile ego. They're worried that other's might see their own inadequacies and so resort to projecting those inadequacies onto others. Usually in the form of insults.
---
&gt;The fact that you'd equate sexual assault to people trolling you in a videogame
---
I very much did not. At all.
---
its inarguably rogue though maybe not by a huge amount
---
And hunters can look at their minimal which shows them where the player with that name is.
---
Are you kidding? He’s literally behind the building where you can’t see him unless you actually go to where he is. You can see the alliance guy from the entrance to the tavern.
---
But don't tell him he'd be happier on a PvE server.
---
I've heard people say this but it's not true.  WOW was from the start a pvp oriented game in the lineage of WC3 - one of the greatest most competitive games of the time.  Also, by the standards of the time the PVP was fairly balanced- as much as it could be with asymmetrical races.  A more accurate statement would be that they didnt consider the ramifications of PVP abilities like fear and stuns, and had to constantly pivot as they realized what abilities were broken and which were useless.  This is the same thing they did in WC3 and it honestly worked pretty well overall- again by the standards of the time.  Create, revise, adjust.
---
If anything I'd bet the PVE was an afterthought which skyrocketed out of control.
---
The wowcensus add-on from like a month ago found warriors to be the most played class. I doubt much had changed since then.
---
Not all of us pay attention to that stuff. It's enough time to just level and play the game. It's another thing to then keep up with an the streamers and figure out where they populate.
---
YoU cAnT mArK pLaYErS
---
Also I've heard you cant be disarmed
---
Sounds like you don t know how this game works
---
Hahah yeah anyone saying 50/50 are just trolling or ignorant. You can see out in the world right now. Alliance have to come to Org to raid it for honor because there's so few horde here. 
---
A great way to see easily the truth is to inspect the honor if the top PvPers on alliance side. You'll note even the guys who pvp all day have less than half the honor of horde because the horde can find pvp anywhere and alliance cannot.
---
lol and the bloodbath probably wont stop until bgs come out
---
I’d love to! Thanks for the heads up.
---
"All you other losers are ebay wow's and dont know jack about the l33tness that is a mage"
---
yep sounds like 2006 alright
---
And nothing wrong with being a nolifer, so no need to get so offended at it!
---
Thank you! Take an upvote. All the "you think you do, but you don'ts" are coming out of the woodwork. What's happening in WoW Classic right now is a once-in-a-lifetime gaming moment and-winning or losing-I am having a blast!
---
Yer always welcome to join us: on Fridays we get liquored up, go to the entrance to the Loch an tell the feckin blueberries to turn 'round an go back to their overgrown fern 'fore we cut em down to eye height!
---
So waiting hours on end for joining a server is acceptable but getting killed for hours on end is not? 
---
Like what were people thinking playing on those extremely high pop servers? Especially when they are not even 60. 
---
I’m a 50 warrior, playing on a high pop server but not q time high (it stays between medium and high pop most days). And other then the occasional brawls there is nothing outstandingly bad imo. 
---
I can just as easily quest and the other faction still leaves you alone (most of the time) if you just trying to quest.
---
It amazes me that people are still clicking heir spells nowadays.
---
a) Blizzard has disagreed with you for as long as WoW has existed
---
b) it isn't pressing one button to duplicate to three characters, because one character is casting the summon and the other two are clicking it. even with your weird anti multiboxing stance, surely you can easily see that scripting this wouldn't even save much time vs just alt tabbing
---
this is not the same thing as running around with eight shamans oneshotting people with eight frost shocks.
---
do you wanna address the part where you claimed it needed ten accounts while i then clearly explained how it would only need three? do you wanna explain why you said it needed ten in the first place? 
---
or is your preferred play to just ignore when someone points out when you say something stupid and change the subject
---
I'll be fine, thanks though.
---
100%
---
I used to say this all the time in response to folks here talking about how vanilla pvp was the best and yadda yadda yadda.
---
I don't come to this sub anymore because it got way too circlejerky, but man, popping in and seeing this community meltdown is such sweet sweet validation :D
---
Ok boomkin
---
Just used the Wowhead one for engineering and it was accurate.
---
Random capital letters were a meme that essentially became a way to communicate sarcasm over text
---
If you are dumb enough to fly into Thorium Point you deserve to get camped.  I didn't even fly there in phase 1.
---
I always used /tar when looking for a rezzer, only found out about spy a few days ago.
---
There's a reason why a lot of big-time arena players didn't bother playing classic.  World PVP is bad it always has been.  Organized BGs is great but pugging bgs is just awful.
---
Your response oozes with your entitlement. No one held a gun to your head and forced you to spend your finite amount of time, both in the day and in your lifetime to play this game and run head first into your death repeatedly instead of finding other ways to enjoy your time in game and out.
---
As a Rogue, honestly it's not actually an issue. People are just bandwagoning. If I want to kill someone it doesn't matter if I can't sneak up on someone, I will still kill them. The only difference is it occasionally allows someone to flare when they otherwise wouldn't. Classes with shields will still keep them up (if you're on a PvP server and don't, you're an idiot anyway).
---
Mcp isn’t needed at alllllllll. Maul is so much threat. I MT mc every week without it.
---
What? Was that a real question? Hahahahaha wow, did you even go to school or did you drop out in middle school? If you did go to school, I guess they didn't teach you problem solving or critical/logical thinking skills. Holy shit that comment might one the dumber ones I have read today. 
---
Obviously by looking your attempt at forming a sentence in your previous comment I am talking to someone with the iq of a fish.
---
I never said it was needed I said it was bis, and it is. If your raid is doing enough dps for your kill times to be remotely relevant then you’ll need it.
---
55 priest. same shit happened on my end. And getting dungeon locked by spamming arena is shit considering 60s will leave as soon as they get their BiS
---
YO, this was my home as a young teen. Holy shit can you give it a kiss and a hug for me ?
---
Unrelated, what is the deal with Reddit bootlicking Keanu Reeves lately? Is there some monthly Reddit meeting where everyone decides to only like, hate, and talk about the same things?
---
Agreed, the victim posts are absurd. If you rolled on a PvP server and can't fathom being killed by the opposing faction you should not have rolled PvP.
---
As an alliance on Skeram (horde dominant server) I have been having an absolute blast.

Will I be able to heal deadmines effectively starting at level 18 as a paladin? I'm going a holy/prot spec to level exclusively in dungeons as a healer/tank, and I want to get started as soon as possible.
---
...yeah and?
---
Yes, I believe you can accomplish all or most of that through a combination of the console, the combat log, Weakauras, and macros. And when you package all of that up you have an 'add-on'
---
Do you think DBM, Weakauras, and every DPS/Threat Meter need to also be banned? They use the exact same system that Spy uses to gather that information.
---
No but it has an estimated PPM
---
I don't think you actually understand what is being proposed here or how this system works.
---
I didn't imagine it would be this hard to find a group as a holy priest on Incednius. Maybe I should switch back to shadow...
---
This is pretty close to prices we got, except we have:Mongoose: 3gGiants: idk
---
Firewater: 5g eachjujus: 3g for AP, 2g for strFAP: 2g each, but we only use 2 on the melee for the run.
---
Other noteables, we use 2x crit stones.
---
What I used in the run:1x mongoose, 2x GFPP, 1x GSPP, 1x GAPP, 1x GFrPP (frost), 4x elemental sharpening stone, 2x fap, 5x MRP, 3x AP JuJu, 2x str JujU, 2x str food, 1x flask of the titans, 5x dense dynamite, 3x goblin sapper Charge. 
---
Some fast math: That's 72 gold without the flask for the speedrun. Around 220 with the flask.
---
You do realise 90 min MC is cataclysmically slow? Sub one hour is easy as hell.
---
A valid question!
---
So I went through a few that I found with a quick google search while I was doing it, and a lot of them showed various time-wasting tactics (like killing the felhunter first instead of just killing the succubus?), and the proper way to do the Burning Steppes demon, rather than the easy way to cheese him on the tree.  Separately there are guides that cover all the ways to do it, I'm almost certain, but I didn't find one easily that covered all the easiest/fastest ways to do it all in one package.  Also some guides were like 30 minutes long......I found myself impatient trying to skip through and get the information I needed. 
---
tl;dr: Consolidation :)
---
Well, the thing is, yes it was. As I already said, I was there back in the day. Yes there were fewer people, but if you think there weren't still tons of people ganking and camping you're just flat out wrong. I'm sorry you had to find out like this.
---
It's not just that they want time efficient, they want effort efficient.  They want grinds they can do while watching netflix on a second monitor.  You can't honor grind that way in phase 2 without battlegrounds and that's why people are mad.
---
It's in the spirit of classic I suppose
---
retail -&gt;
---
I’m 60 wearing benediction and both t2 pieces. Why would I even care about you? Just making sure u know u are wrong.
---
I'm on a similar pop server and I literally can't get anything done. Every flight point is camped, every single major quest hub is camped. There's raids camping Blackrock at all times. This is nothing like Vanilla WoW, the player base on Classic are a distilled version of Vanilla's and the population limits are way higher than they used to be. Had I any idea at all that it was going to be like this I'd have rolled PvE. Now the only option I have is to either quit or reroll and start over.
---
You can see the part he was aiming for. It didn't work.
---
As some one that played alliance on a majority hoard pvp server in Vanilla nope that's pretty much what world pvp was like back in vanilla. 
---
There's a reason I went pve this time around. Doesn't matter if there are more horde or ally on my server I'm not getting ganked, and it is wonderful.
---
Hell, I remember people getting kicked from guilds for frequently ganking lowbies because you would make them look bad.  The lower population of gaming back then seemed like it may have helped drive the social aspect.  That social aspect has since been fading away and I'd say was a factor for this bullshit.
---
PvP is not the problem. Implementing the honor system BEFORE battlegrounds is the problem.
---
Thinking about joining a normal realm on horde side. Can't decide. Should I do Windseeker or Mankrik?
---
Touch of the Holy Flame from the quest Morbent Fel can be used for ranged pulling if you lack one
---
Indeed. Herb must learn and adapt, wait for open migration to pve server or quit.
---
This has been me since level 45. I can barely play the game anymore, and it has nothing to do with PVP or not PVP.  I'm not even on a PVP server.  The game was a lot of fun to walk down memory lane for the first 40\~ levels because the zones were pleasant and interesting to see.  However, none of the zones, none of the quests, nothing really about the game is appealing anymore.  It has felt more of a grind than a joy, especially many of the quests.  I am finding a *tremendous* number of "fuck this quest" quests.  
---
Ex. When I got to the Blasted Lands, there is a quest for basilisk brains that I need ten of.  However, they spawn with vultures and boars so not always available to kill.  Furthermore when they are spawned, there is usually only 3-4 tops.  Since the servers are no longer layered (a big mistake in my opinion), there are tons more players now in the zones competing to get the quests completed.  Teaming up is not wise for drop quests because then you need X number more drops before everyone gets done.  Killing them faster doesn't matter if the spawns take forever to come back.
---
I am disappointed in myself for getting a 6 month subscription.  It's a shame, but it is what it is.
---
And I want to spend time with my wife and kids more than dump all my leisure time into a game I already cleared through almost all of Naxx 15 years ago!  This is a game bro, and you can certainly call people who take their time to level bad just like I can call someone who spends all their freetime on it a nolifer and we each can each argue about it because this is the glorious internet!
---
Can you honestly argue that server imbalance isn't an issue? I don't really get your point. Unbalanced servers are bad for everyone. Eventually the down faction will give up and PvP will die. Me and my crew are already talking about abandoning the losing fight. Until you play alliance on a 70% horde server, you should probably keep your opinions to yourself.

If you won't read what I wrote then I'm done reading what you write. Goodbye.
---
You don't seem to understand what is being proposed here or how it works. Your client would still render those players at the distance they currently render them at and would know what their health and energy and mana are at. That information is not sent through the combat logs from server to client. Addons only know what blizzard shows them, and they can restrict what an addon sees while still giving that data to their own client code.
---
u/vomitisnatureslube gets it
---
if people weren't so passionate about no changes we'd probably have changes, and they wouldn't be the sane common sense changes you all are talking about. the reason for no changes is that blizzard cannot be trusted to make changes, and I think it was worth it.
---
layering was probably their biggest change and look at that fuck up. do you want more of that?
---
I suspect there is some new automatic botting software that they aren't detecting.
---
I went to the Docks dungeon yesterday in WoD to farm a little gold for my sub. I needed a token.
---
Outside is a constant stream of players appearing and running back inside. At first I don't think much about it, they are gold farming like me. But if you sit there watching them for a few minutes, it's clear they are bots without a human controlling it. They take the same exact steps, pauses, movements every time. Some of them run awkwardly, but it's the same each time. The timing is totally repetitive.
---
And they do this all day. Without Blizzard catching on.
---
No thanks. Won't click
---
Even on Nostalrius PvP it was never this bad. Ever. 2019 "gamer mentality" doesn't gel well with Classic. I hope Blizzard gives us paid transfers because I'll quit before I level another 60.
---
&gt;Do you really think anybody is going to sit there scanning their combat log like that?
---
I would stay on your warrior, I would prot tank or make your own groups. and get the tanks/healers and other DPS that is needed to clear a dungeon. You could advertise in LFG stating that 'xyz item is reserved' which is merely a deterrent for other people who are after the same items are you are to join your group. This will enable you to get the pre-bis required to raid.
---
Warriors are fucking awesome DPS in raids and as long as you can output something reasonable i.e. beat a hunter you shouldn't have any issue finding a guild who needs one.
---
If you still think healing is your call, get the pally to 60, get the gear required by guilds to raid and raid with it. You don't really have any commitment to your current guild so just wait until there is someone who is willing to pick up an hpal
---
I have no interest in having an argument with you over the ethics of multi boxing. That's not the topic here.
---
you made a claim that this type of summoning service could only be provided through multi boxing techniques and scripts and that is clearly not the case because it could easily be done just running three clients and tabbing between them, which is the only thing I was pointing out.
---
Yes a Shadowfang
---
why? Just about every pvp server is horde favored.
---
Some changes. But not this.
---
Means you only care about yourself and fail to realize how good this is for the majority. Take a seat.
---
*Dr Evil airquotes*
---
&gt; probably
---
Okay yeah he's cool, so are other people. Doesn't explain the bootlicking.
---
For real.  It shouldn't even have to be asked lol
---
that feeling when you look at the map, and the only good place to level is searing gorge... time to take the slow zf grind for a couple more levels.
---
Late to reply but glad you posted this. Many people are wrong here. I got pics of my guild clearing BWL too in Dec 2005 with the old ugly set on. Myself included as I was a hunter with that circlet on which was DS.
---
I mean, that's debatable.
---
First, not everyone gets a chance at all loot. That's silly. You think that mage has a chance at rogue gear? The whole point of not inviting the 3rd rogue is that there's less loot competition. Just like reserving loot.
---
Second, if there's not enough classes, you can "invite anyone and deal with the competition"? Yeah, just like reserving loot. You can stop reserving if there's not enough players and deal with the competition. It's the literal same thing.
---
Finally, making the claim that reserving loot necessitates a bad group comp is entirely unfair and untrue. You can, of course, have a bad comp. Same as any group. Or you could not. Everyone's goal is to kill bosses. It's little value to create a group that can't kill a boss, cause then it doesn't matter who wants what gear.
---
It seems to me that you think reserving loot == no gear at all. You realize that if I res Baron cape as a warrior, a rogue will still join the group? There are many items to get.
---
The biggest problem in classic is that everyone is min-maxing. Thats why I always was against "#nochanges" because I knew this would happen.
---
It's both. And also some other things.
---
I think blizzard only acts if they get a bunch of reports on people. I report stuff against TOS every time, but I don't think it does much good with one report.
---

Its like I'm really arguing with a 15 year old!
---
Funny how you can restore an item you had to type delete into a textbox to destroy , or perform multiple clicks to disenchant your main hand instead of poisoning (true story)
---
That Wa all kinds of bad ass.
---
I said I didn't remember reading that, and now you're just ignoring that I said I DIDN'T REMEMBER READING THAT. 
---
&gt;should”neck themselves”
---
if I did read that, it would not register as "telling someone to kill themselves" - it seems more like an auto-correct thing - but hey, back in my day we said you should take a long walk off a short pier - I guess we were all homicidal too
---
&gt;you’re here defending him saying he’s just been bullied?
---
his post has been deleted, from what I remember(reading at work on my phone) he posted something semi long complaining about the faction imbalance - and I said you're wasting your time because the horde players posting here don't care because they're on the faction that's getting the positive benefits(aka bullies don't mind a broken system as long as they're getting theirs)
---
it's funny, ya'll want to pick on people for over reacting to being outnumbered and having their game ruined, but  someone saying "neck themselves" over the internet without any actual danger is  so far past the line for you. whatever, grow the f up, no one's actually going to kill themselves because someone was upset online and said that phrase
---
&gt;Has nothing to do with him being “bullied” and even if it does it’s NOT okay
---
nope, it's not alright, but me pointing out that it happens and it is possible is not the same as me condoning it. I am stating a fact, not saying it's ok
---
You cant go and sat anyone who disagrees with you is obviously lying. It deliberately just ends all discussion and you get to say "see, I was right!" No matter what people respond with.
---
Alliance on Horde dominated server, loving it. If I'm in a ganked area, I call on friends and guildies and we take back our land.
---
If you didn't know, this is from a Youtube video.
---
Considering the playerbase across all servers vs amount of tickets that must get generated per day in the developers queue, adding a customer service agent to address everyone's special need would be logistically improbable. 
---
If this game is eating at you like this, check in to how you're feeling about your personal life and realize it's not the game that's making you this upset.
---
The same happened in 2005. (Remember the #nochanges).We knew this would happen 6 months ago. PvE servers are not filled, but everyone went to PvP server and now they suffering it.
---
It's not emotional.  In fact you are emotional to your time, lol ever heard of sunk cost?  But yes he's being facetious.  It's equivalent to fuck you, which is also acceptable.
---
52 Tauren Druid. Been leveling a priest. I'm level 24 now.
---
Mages are a problem for combat sword rogues.  They have much more snares/roots than you have ways to break them and you lack the burst to make up for it.
---
There's been about 4-5 guilds transfer over but honestly it's not nearly enough. The game has become unplayable as Horde on this server. It takes 45 mins of corpse walks just to make it to black rock spire. 
---
If you're a horde guild thinking of transferring over don't do it. You'll just slow your progression.
---
Nifty stopwatch, carrot on a stick
---
Honestly trying to do anything in BRM is fucking terrible but when I do get into wpvp groups we do well although I have noticed that the horde have way better tactics.
---
Oooohhweeee he's tryin'!
---
I currently play on a PVE server, all world PVP happen in events hosted by players in a set location to ensure there's no dishonorable kills, we had about 100 vs 100 event going on, but the servers started to lag greatly and it honestly became very un-enjoyable lol
---
It's up for debate - shooting as the primary role can apply to heroes such as Pharah or JR. Some, like Baptiste which is a hybrid, and Sombra which is heavily focussed on utility. This is my current take on those who actually spend most of their time shooting as their primary function:
---
Zarya
---
D.Va (debatable, being peel tank)
---
Hamster (debatable, again a peel tank)
---
Roadhog (debatable, bruiser role)
---
Ashe
---
Bastion
---
Doomfist (debatable, most DPS is through his abilities)
---
Genji
---
Hanzo
---
JR
---
McCree
---
Pharah
---
Reaper
---
S:76
---
Sombra (debatable due to her abilities)
---
Torb
---
Tracer
---
Widowmaker
---
Ana
---
Baptiste (debatable due to being hybrid)
---
Lucio (only in ladder play)
---
Zenyatta
---
Moira (she shoots all the time, technically, and ladder play is much more DPS-oriented than organized matches).
---
That's 8/31 who definitely don't shoot as their main function, with an additional 7 that I consider debatable. That's practically half the cast, and some of those you see very frequently (particularly shield tanks).
---
It's not a huge upgrade to the prebis xbow, it's just how things work.
---
It's all part of the nochanges, if anything there's not enough whine to reflect how the forums were back then.
---
The funniest are definitely the ones suggesting major changes to the pvp-system after 2 days, absolutely clueless. I wished they'd open the gates to a PvE-server and they would all transfer and then realise their mistake after a week once the dust has settled and the novelty is gone.
---
I made it to 60, got pretty good gear and I’m still getting destroyed. The party doesn’t end once you’re max level, still a bloodbath. 
---
Faction imbalance seems to be the worst problem for me. My server has become more and more horde dominated which has made the game almost unplayable. I’m killed by multiple gankers in most alli camps and corpse camped until I log out. I kind of expected. 
---
I’ll most likely just be logging on for raid day for the next few weeks until it gets a bit less hectic.  Hopefully I’m just unlucky and people are having more fun with phase 2 than I am.
---
Go To ReTail
---
Nice. If I ever meet you there, I’ll wave.
---
[Spell alert](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-578) and [paranoia](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/paranoia/) are two addons that existed in vanilla, which are similar to Spy. Paranoia for instance, registers these events to gain info about sourrounding enemy players:
---
CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_HITS  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_MISSES  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_DAMAGE  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_PERIODIC\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_BUFFS  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_PERIODIC\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_DAMAGE 
---
From the event names, it seems to only catch players *doing* something, wether that be a heal dot, aura, spell or whatever and not instantly when a hostile player is within the players vicinity. I might be wrong here, though.
---
However, in patch 2.4.0 they revamped the [combat log API](https://wow.gamepedia.com/COMBAT_LOG_EVENT) and they've probably added more stuff to over the years. It might be the case that Spy would not be functionally possible in vanillla, the same way it currently works. If so, it is reasonable to look into removing certain events to the combat log api. If it would be possible however, it should stay.
---
Just keep repeating: "I'm doing this because I think it's fun". You might end up believing it on death #12 in a row.
---
48 is cutoff I believe. Correct me if I'm wrong
---
Nah I'm actually human
---
There is one.
---
&gt;Most good tanks are done with dungeons or have a guild that they roll with.
---
This... but when I offer to sell my time/effort for a dungeon run people get offended and come to reddit to cry.
---
Everyone wants the bis geared tanks, but doesn't want to pay them a small fee. Its silly. On my dps alts, i pay tanks all the time to make my life easier.
---
I dont get why you are playing dumb. Stop trying to have a discussion if you're just gonna pretend that "paranoia" was an addon that more than 0.001% of the population had back then.
---
Dude, i played back then, and TBC, nobody i ever fucking met had that addon. A handful of people did maybe. Now every gank squad runs around with that addon and you're like "well it existed back then too". Come on bro. It wasn't an issue back then, it is an issue now, simple as that.
---
Seeing through terrain is stupid. You cannot defend it. Nothing you say will make it ok that some guy who think he's hiding behind a tree, door, in a house is now showing up on every players screen because a buff faded from him or whatever.
---
If we're doing away with #nochanges can we get summoning stones and disable Rallying Cry, Warchief's Blessing, Songflower, etc. when zoning into a raid zone?
---
k, thnx
---
Bgs aren't coming out till after new years, ill be back to see if you quit because of it.
---
Per your definition of winning maybe, which is of course going to be extremely different from billions of other people.
---
Whatever the case, hopefully you can find it in your heart to accept us lowly players still working on hitting 60 once we get there.  We live for your acceptance, oh random person on reddit.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROUND
---
says the Ironforge flight master
---
Ok, must've been a warlock's pet then.
---
Considered Winterspring or Deadwind Pass? No quests in Deadwind pass but you should be able to grind peacefully.
---
I..... Actually don't mind this change.
---
Rofl
---
Holy shit. Dude. Just stop it. Like why are you sitting here trying to defend yourself. If you missed it you missed it. That’s enough. I didn’t ignore it. But you went in to say he’s only saying it because he’s bullied. This implies that it’s justifiable. I don’t care about WPVP. I care about people that are fucked up like that.
---
All I was pointing out was that you were (unintentionally) agreeing with someone who is telling others to kill themselves. That’s it. Chill out.
---
Not granted. Git gud
---
The fact that it puts a giant label across your screen screaming that a stealth player is around completely changes peoples behavior. I could be at max draw distance hiding behind a tree and suddenly without ever seeing me they know I'm around.  
---
Completely removes any element of surprise with zero effort from the target. This basically negates one of the main advantages of rogues. Pretty much every fight I've had since P2 the other player knew I was around and was prepared for me attacking despite never actually seeing me going into stealth. Spy just alerted them that I did.
---
Only a handful of servers had layers. 
---
Mine didn't and we still saw a large spike.
---
until I don't need a retail sub to play the game I want to play, it's going to get shit on
---
This, people are getting way too hyperbolic. It's literally been only five days.
---
This nonsense will calm down when bgs drop.
---
It was just as bad back in vanilla before bgs.
---
Technically, if you're going for world/server first or clear times, PvE is also competing against other players.
---
(Devil's Advocate) The classic ranking system has one thing for it. Scarcity. There are a finite number of rank 14 weapons. It seemed like in arenas, everyone had the gear so the gear didn't mean shit. I kind of like having only a few bad asses because then it means something. When anyone can get it, then whats the point?
---
Just my two cents though.
---
Yes, right now as alliance id like to be on a pve server. But that will change when this insanity dies down. Pve server will die first.
---
One of the best videos so far
---
I literally never saw a camped FP on my server until P2.
---
Only took 45 mins of running :)
---
Lol Alliance on my server are just roaming 40mans steamrolling flight paths spamming  /spit. They are making themselvs look bad. You probably dont notice this because when you land you arent being attacked and camped by your own faction. But Alliance are definitely doing it and being much more childish about it.
---
If someone dies to my dots out of range, do i still get honor?
---
I've killed a few people this way, as in they run so far I cant target anymore, but still die.
---
I dont seem to get a message in chat about getting honor :(
---
i have been running a census scan on my server frequently on both sides since layering has been removed.
---
a census scan takes about 30 minutes to run, i fully understand that it is not 100% accurate, but a servers online population is not drastically changing in 30 minutes. so short of blizzard giving us actual numbers, it is the closest thing we will ever have. 
---
here are the only few things that can cause an inaccuracy:
---
while scanning for lets say, orc warlocks, someone is on an orc warlock, is recorded. he logs off after the scan due to sheer luck
---
said orc warlock is now on an undead rogue, and the addon has not scanned yet. addon scans for undead rogues, and is then recorded. that person is essentially seen as +2 to the online population count.
---
*however* during the 30 minute scan, 5 more orc warlock might sign on *after* the addon has scanned for orc warlocks. which essentially cancels out the previous scenario, probability wise anyways. 
---
however, on horde side alone i will log 5000 horde characters online in a single scan, so even that alone is roughly 1500-2000 more online players than a vanilla server in 2005.
---
lets say I do a scan on horde and alliance, and between the 2 factions I end up with 7000 people. **if** the cap is still 3000, that would mean in 30 minutes, roughly 4000 people would have to log off after the addon scans their class, and log into another class that hasnt been scanned. 
---
probability wise, that isn't likely.
---
if you'd like to figure out the actual number and play on a locked server, the census addon was recently updated with a work around since it was broken about a month ago. it is about 95% as fast as it was before it was broken.
---
&gt;Alliance on Horde dominated server
---
&gt; If I'm in a ganked area, I call on friends and guildies and we take back our land.
---
Yeah, I don't believe you. We tried that. Put together a full raid group at 3 AM yesterday to try to take back land. Got crushed, because we're so heavily outnumbered. I think there are a lot of people who enjoy making this a shitty experience for everyone else and want Phase 2 to stick around. 
---
Me, I fell abruptly out of love with playing this game in the last 24 hours after my hundredth corpse run. I am level 59, almost fully pre-raid BIS geared, and I just don't want to play anymore, because I can't solo-quest and I can't get a group together that doesn't immediately get killed by the Horde raids that are camping literally every flight point in PVP-enabled zones in the game. 
---
There's no point. It's miserable. If they release battlegrounds in the next week or so, or enable PVP -&gt; PVE realm transfers, I'll keep playing. Otherwise, I'm cancelling my sub. Phase 2 is utter garbage.
---
Most likely weak auras
---
&gt; If you missed it you missed it. That’s enough.
---
obviously not because you continued to berate  me about it
---
&gt;But you went in to say he’s only saying it because he’s bullied. This implies that it’s justifiable.
---
no, I said it's POSSIBLE for people who are bullied to be angry and violent. that does not mean it's ok, but that does not mean the bullies get off scott free in my book either. each person is responsible for their own actions
---
&gt;All I was pointing out was that you were (unintentionally) agreeing with someone who is telling others to kill themselves. That’s it. Chill out.
---
but I wasn't, I am simply stating that people who have been bullied can lash out in anger and violence. that's a fact, you're adding the rest to it
---
I still hold on to a sliver of hope that I’ll one day have this item. But now that silver got smaller ;-;
---
I logged in on my 60 alliance rogue on Herod about 20 minutes ago after 15 minute queue, I had logged out in hearthglenn in a safe spot behind the outer walls so I could mount up or hearth out, was instantly detected by spy addon and a 5 man group of 3 warriors 1 mage and priest killed me after I started fighting the solo warrior that I thought was the only competition I had, I got him down to 10% hp before getting clobbered by the rest of his party, while I was sitting there dead said warrior spammed go to retail and not going to happen to me like he didn’t just have his ass saved by his party.  Logged off didn’t even bother clicking the release button I’ll be back on Tuesday for raid and I’ll raid log till p3
---
Leveling is rewarding. Small things give you noticeable improvement and rare big things make you feel awesome. Your character skills unfold slowly and even at later levels you get new awesome tools.
---
Guess no one here and the paranoia addon in vanilla...it did nearly the Same thing
---
&gt; So because I had a different experience to you in an MMO, I'm lying? 
---
I guess that's not fair to you. Lying is a deliberate act. You could just be misinformed about the faction population balance on your server. What you're describing is not how things are going on the unbalanced servers. There are no roving Alliance death squads. Alliance is penned in and Horde is farming Honor off anyone who tries to go do PVE. This is the Phase 2 experience. It is going to make thousands and thousands of people cancel their subscriptions, and I'll be one of them if they don't get BGs out immediately.
---
&gt; The fact is irrelevant
---
so is your entire argument with me then, because I stated a fact which you implied was me justifying something
---
&gt; Good luck in life and try to read things more carefully in the future.
---
same to you, good luck in life, and try to not add things to other people's statements then try and pick a fight because of your own implications
---
Top of Gold Shire Inn
---
They did ban the lfg add-on, and the census add-on lol
---
Elune's Grace and and Starshards are dog though.
---
Wouldn't you rather to become stone or resist fears constantly?
---
Bubble and inner fire are enough mitigation imo..
---
Friend and I are just rolling a 2 man group and picking people off. Hella fun.
---
Its hard to find Alliance in small groups though at the moment and we need to play smart to get kills against the Alliance Death ball raids.
---
I've seen this argument a lot, and it makes sense. But just because it was allowed in Vanilla doesn't mean it shouldn't/won't be banned. It's literally a game changing addon that ruins the experience a lot for stealth classes. Also what do you mean the LFG add-on was banned.
---
Inb4 his guild wants to move lmao
---
Ive noticed about a 10% boost to dmg from 20 to 23. Not huge, but noticeable. Its all about having good weapons
---
with so many epics and enchants howd you almost lose to that non-epic rogue
---
Right? You better be walking from a couple zones over. Fight paths are camped to shit
---
that’s the problem with this game for me. the PVP element is pretty shit, and thsts the whole point of leveling up according to everyone. maybe at 60 it gets better but i’ve never once had an actual pvp interaction that went remotely how it’s intended to go. either they ignore me or they kill me. i’ve had some mess around with me and that’s funny but never once a pvp fight with someone my level. i get it’s the games design but it’s sort of shit in real world usage. that said i don’t really play anymore because i disliked it so take what i said with a grain of salt
---
As much as I want the queue to be longer. I don’t.
---
Nah im good
---
Facts. The pressure, the repair bill (higher for being plate AND because you're always taking damage and dying), the constant trash tank "tank wtf are u doing, don't pull that pack we can skip", the dps constantly attacking shit before you use any abilities and screwing up the pull and causing wipes that you get blamed for etc etc. Tanking is awesome with friends but blows with pugs.
---
No, this is absolutely not how it was played then. It was shit in vanilla, but it wasn't *this* kind of shit. In vanilla, Horde wasn't camping the docks at Menethil and Theramore 24/7, or running literal encirclement patterns on Light's Hope Chapel and Chillwind Point, with full raids breaking off into groups to spawn-camp anyone who makes the mistake of coming in. 
---
I'd rather fight with people that I'm not going to convince on the Internet about how awful Phase 2 is than actually play the shit.
---
&gt;If you don't like Phase 2 PvP then retail is better for you, even though nothing even remotely resembling Phase 2 PvP has ever been implemented in Vanilla WoW
---
You're not making any sense.
---
But everyone didn't have the gear. Like raiding the better skilled players got more gear.
---
The LFG add-on isn't banned. It's still working as of today.
---
Here's the curse page: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg
---
It doesn’t because the message was ALWAYS there. I don’t use spy, because I can read the combat log in real time. I play a stealth character and I use strategy to plan my attacks which includes stealthing way before I reach combat log range. BECAUSE I KNOW THE MESSAGE IS IN THE COMBAT LOG!!!. Who cares that the message now pops up? It does not and will not stop my ability to be effective.
---
Ethics of the company aside, I think it's a very creative idea. My impression is they ultimately made it to grab the market of youth itching for a successor to the COD franchise, in addition to those looking for an esports promise outside of LOL. The result is an incredibly toxic community that hasn't had time to literally mature, and the company artificially inflating the esports scene to keep that flow of attention coming from young players looking for the dream.
---
Works perfectly for me :)
---
Amen. So much complaining.
---
 Nope. ClassicLFG is still in the game and works perfectly :)
---
I play a rogue. Zero chance of me ever running Strat UD without rolling on the back.  It's the only thing I need out of there.
---
You've proved my point though. You want ppl to run you through and get less for their efforts even though they contributed equally. Which is why I do not run reserve groups.
---
Most of my play time is on alliance...
---
Get 60, worry about that shit later - everything can be farmed faster at 60
---
Silithus a good place to lvl at 52 ? Warrior here asking horde if that matters
---
I like World PVP as it exists before the Honor system. When there's no incentive to murder the random dude you bump into, sometimes you fight someone, sometimes you don't, sometimes you help them kill a mob and wave and go your separate ways. Rarely do you get corpse-camped, rarely do groups of higher level characters camp flight points or docks. 
---
When you bring honor into the equation, suddenly people have an incentive to never give you those positive interactions, to never let you go along your way, to sit and camp transit points and instance portals. Because they just want to farm. 
---
I rejoined my guild from vanilla here and was super excited to do so. But they're a PVP guild, so I reluctantly rolled a PVP server. And I had fun in Phase 0 and Phase 1, as I expected. And then this came, and now I'm torn between hoping battlegrounds come immediately, hoping that they open character transfers so I can bounce to a PVE server (even if it means leaving my guild and have to pay money), or entertaining the idea of cancelling my subscription. This is not fun.
---
A function of the addon got modified so it isn't as good as before, but it's still more effective than lfg
---
Is it just me or are horde genuinely the assholes?  I have tried 4 separate nights to quest in northern STV at 30, and every night there was a different group of asshole gankers.
---
Bro its bullshit that they are down voting you for asking a question
---
Me, a lvl 23 hunter in wetlands
---
*chuckles, im in danger*
---
People who are pissed off at blizzard making a huge mistake regarding server population size doesn't make them entitled. 
---
When you put time and money into a live service, and that service is flawed, then you have a right to be critical of that service. 
---
The zones do not support the amount of players currently running around in them, especially now that layering is gone.
---
Ah shut up crybabies and get good, stop complaining about addons
---
My paladin in retail has had Light of Elune in his bank for 12 years..still waiting for the right fight to pop it on.
---
I'll definitely give this a try, thanks for the advice!
---
Hard agree. I know it's gonna be downvote city to say don't play classic in a classic sub but it's truly miserable. Maybe if you join a high faction pop realm but speaking as a person on the 35% population side it is fucking awful. Multiple 60s ganking you every where you go even when you're not worth honor is one of the worst feelings ever. This will subside but people are just 60 with nothing to do but 2-3 hours of raiding once a week so they're finding a way to fill time with the new "content"
---
You can always roll a pve server though. No shame in that.
---
are the coords not the same as in classic?
---
I logged off of my level 55 warrior a week before p2 was announced and rolled a mage on a pve server. I am so weak.

I like this idea even though it's inaccurate.. but we budge on core mechanics outside of the obvious QoL stuff.. there isn't much of an argument for the bad ideas then.

this entire thread is a troll. either that or your a fool,i don't know which. not every single person comes from retail,they've been playing on pservers for over a decade,or just new people to classic and Warcraft as a whole. so they are getting their first experience at the ganking trash of wow,and get just as annoyed as a retail person.
---
fun fact,whats fun for a ganker isn't fun for someone new,they will quit instead of "lul just reroll"
---
Its this level of entitlement that shifted the game towards retail in the first place.
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
"They don't know what they want"
---
It all comes full circle.
---
Should have mentioned this is an alt I have of the opposing faction on a different realm, and I’m not in a rush to hit 60 on this character especially since I’m almost at the level where I’ll be farmed for honor.
---
So the ability doesn't activate on an offhand swing yet still affects it (because bad code probably). Dual wield inherently gets a hit penalty in most cases. As far as I recall/know, the trick only works for "next hit" abilities and I think instant casts and stuff like that don't really take the offhand into account (I may be mistaken on that though). So the trick bypasses dual wield hit penalty but does not consume the bonus it's using nor does it need to use rage. I would absolutely say that's an exploit, getting something for nothing (other than doing more actions per minute). I think you're reading "intended" differently than I am. Here I take it to mean "it's intended as a bug that was present in vanilla btw #nochanges".
---
Excited to see all the toxic people be negative
---
Keep skinning until you hit 60, engineering doesn't offer much when it comes to levelling and skinning will provide you with a steady source of income while grinding.
---
Sadlife
---
I’d geal but I find I dont even seen the dungeon. Just staring at the 5 healthbars and poking then heals .. its so non fun. Maybe theres mods to mske it more engaging :/
---
The ONLY difference is on an RP server everyone writes "OOC" before everything they type
---
Doesn't really matter if you have 20+ groups willing to spend their entire evening getting 5honor kills for the sake of being assholes. Unless you're moving in a raid group you will die over and over and over again and it has absolutely nothing to do with skill or gear.
---
That doesn't prove anything.
---
Get off your dinosaur grandpa. If you were good you d be 60.
---
See [the spell in question](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2651/elunes-grace). My understanding is it does in fact only affect ranged physical damage, but NOT physical damage in general. I may be mistaken but I do think the game makes a distinction between whether that physical damage is ranged or melee for some things.
---
bitchin' and moanin'

Arena hasn't been about skill even in BC. Just find the three faceroll squad and spam.  Until you get "balanced" then find the new broken comp.

It's completely random. I've gone 10 hours without one and I've also gotten 4 in a night. Up to 44 eyes solo total

Ok boomer
---
I was using combat log like that back in classic/tbc and wotlk. Majority of people didn't use that, mostly gankers like me, or dedicated pvpers. 
---
Now, I don't use it at all, cuz it looks like shit with 2 stupid tabs, I have no idea how it works.
---
When The Forsaken regained their control from Arthas they went back to their Alliance homes to seek refuge. They were casted out by The Alliance and sought refuge with the Horde after Thrall was convinced to accept them by the Earthen Ring.
---
&gt;Its not PvP 
---
yes it is. just stop being bad and get good. life is not fair so stop being a crybaby
---
Bye
---
Problem is the second I loaded up and clicked stealth that warrior was in range to see me on spy addon and he was running around in epic mount and guessed that I was hiding behind wall and got lucky enough to get me out of stealth with demo shout
---
My Mage is level 58 now, was 48 when P2 launched but I’m not stupid enough to think I could grind mobs or do quests on a PvP server when guilds are ranking up so I sat in ZF and BRD the whole time. yes sometimes I get smashed getting to the dungeon and have to corpse walk there but that’s the fucking game and complaining about it is just plain stupid. I would’ve played on a PVE server if I wanted to avoid the possibility of getting killed by people trying to rank. It’s the fucking game and how it works but even despite that I’m getting a fair amount of HKs fighting back and joining counter gank teams clearing out BRM. 
---
This is what we asked for. Complaining about being killed by higher level players on a PvP server??? The fuck did people think would happen. Just deal with it and accept your leveling will be delayed.
---
The NE rogues killing people coming out of UC yesterday must have missed the memo that they weren't supposed to be able to do that on Herod. Or that giant mass of Alliance holding down BRM and fucking up the nearby flightmasters, or the roving squad fucking up any Horde who dared touch the road in Felwood at like 3am, etc.
---
your faction is fighting back, best join them.
---
Can you elaborate on this? and is it priest only? (eg; which entrance, things to avoid, etc..)
---
I’ve been calling this for months
---
This is not an airport , no need to announce your departure . Blizzard won’t miss you

#nochanges.
---
Is kind of misunderstood by some of the retail and current wow players. 
---
It is more a simple way of saying "we dont changes to the original game where possible". 
---
You ask for xmog we can say #nochanges 
---
You ask for updated character models we can say #nochanges
---
You ask for class balance we can say #nochanges. 
---
Now obviously this is a dig at private server dudes but thats cool. I just want you to know what we mean by #nochanges.
---
I think we’re both the bad guys. The kobolds are the good ones.
---
A man with integrity!

I rolled PVP because I wanted to play with my friend who is on a PVP server. I'm still in the 30's so it hasn't really gotten out of hand yet and I don't mind. But I can very much see people rolling on the same server to play with IRL friends but not really wanting the PVP aspect in the way it currently is.
---
As you said, impossible to farm, run dungeons or anything and despite loving PvP you can't do that either because most of the time you just die in at least 1:5 outnumbered fights. There isn't anything to do at this point if you're not ok with spending more time dead than alive.
---
Wpvp is ruined because of the addon and I only got classic again to pvp (not to parse 15+ year old scripted encounters), so you don’t need to be condescending to the guy. 
---
Not everyone was running that vanilla addon 15 years ago, I’m not debating if it existed or not back then but when I was playing vanilla hardly anyone had it. It does ruin the wpvp experience imo but wow classic /= wow vanilla so I wouldn’t expect anything less.
---
&gt;I wouldn't want to use this system in a pug
---
That's exactly the opposite of how it SHOULD be. Blizzard removed Master Looter from modern WoW because it was being abused by people or something (maybe they didn't like to pay for extra game masters/customer support). If gold bid were implemented into the game (particularly Flamestrike Single Bid, which is more resistant to "bidding up to push up the price just to increase the price someone else pays", because you can't place a 'fake' bid and are more likely to have to pay that price than anyone else), then just like selecting Need before Greed as a loot option, it eliminates the potential for abuse that Master Looter allows.
---
When implemented into the game, it does mean that raid members could leave the raid early and still get their fair share. Some people who use gold bid prefer this incentive to stay. Some people also prefer "enforcing a guild cut and skimming off the top" — I read about one guild (there was a blog called Greedy Goblin for it), where anyone could form a raid in the guild and the person who did got a bonus out of the earnings from gold bid. It was the incentive to do that extra work of organizing.
---
But there are other ways to do this. Guilds could just do "raid leader gets first X number of BoE epic crafting material drops" or something. Like tanks reserving orbs in Stratholme Live (something that I never encountered when I played WoW 15 years ago; I think I would prefer rewards to be friendship).
---
Rolling for drops can work reasonably well. But if there's one player with an item level 68 epic weapon, and one with an item level 55 blue weapon, and an item level 70 epic weapon drops, gold bid is a better system for a PUG than rolling.

Hi - there are 2 methods of scanning.
---
There is the crappy red button that says 'Scan'. This will scan the AH one page at a time. Its a holdover from how you originally had to do it back in 2004.
---
The new method is the little &gt;&gt; button at the top middle. It should scan the entire AH in about 10 seconds flat. But it can only be done once per 15 minutes.
---
I see mostly hunters with an asian writing as pet name. Attacked one while he was looting and was ignored, he ran straight to the next mob, very suspicious...
---
Why did you respond to yourself you pleb?
---
”Laughs in PVE server”
---
I'm a pretty casual player on Bigglesworth just logging on every other day to do a couple dungeons and work on my prebis/professions.
---
It's miserable. Massive squads roaming around killing everyone. I'm sure it's fun but I don't have the time. And now I don't have the time to run dungeons because I have to corpse hop to get into Scholomance.
---
Transfers are available but nobody will use them to move to a soon to be dead servers.
---
Can confirm, am tank that this works on.
---
I feel your pain, bro :)

A POW in his own town...

And them being serious about it lmaooo

Yes, this would solve the problem.
---
Hell, just toss WSG to us and it would solve the problem.
---
I lol’d at that
---
Dagger is only worth it if you get perd/core hound though and that can take a while, before that sub swords are alot better.
---
My guild's been doing the same, luckily we have a pretty hot spot hour (Tue 7pm)
---
It was actually a orc shaman, sorry for not being specific. I was stalking him waiting for a good time to ambush him but he just mounted up, went towards my way and instntly placed an earthbind totem so he knew I was there
---
When most people spammed "No changes" what they actually meant, only include the changes that I enjoyed on private servers
---
Thanks to nost most vanilla PS players would flood into the currently trendy PS whose active pop would exceed 10k. They enjoyed the excessive crowds
---
Nah Herod is horde heavy so I assume they have transfer open, I wouldn’t take transfer without my guild I been with them for a long time, I tried leveling my 44 warrior and was in stv all of 5 minutes before getting killed by horde deathsquad, mind you am not even worth honor to them at 44
---
When you asked "maybe it's just me?", The answer was yes
---
Can we have your stuff ?
---
You CAN target stealthed players with the addon, and even send pets on them (from what I've heard). The targetting function has been confirmed though.
---
Phase 1 wpvp was incredible though.
---
Except you will come across the same comp or comps that counter you at the top end and you will have to win... so it is about skill, draft skill and play skill are both important.
---
Best phase every 
---
\- lakeshire EU PvE
---
Just a quick question, in p2, if a fireball hits on multiple players, will it reduce all of their threat or only reduce the main target's?
---
Tissues, get your tissues here!
---
I see you've never actually played horde or you'd know how stupidly good your travel options are.
---
Changing in-game mechanics is not gonna happen obviously since there's #nochanges policy.
---
This is like when Matthew McConaughey was falling thru that black hole in interstellar
---
This was exactly what we did in Vanilla. We rally at Kargath while our rogues scout out BRM.  Once almost everyone arrived at Kargath, we'll Zerg the BWL entrance. Many times there'll be a huge but brief brawl at the entrance. Then we get on with our raid.
---
Is it NA or EU
---
Either way it's comparing apples and oranges, the spy addon is legitimately broken.
---
it should be larger, if I am not mistaken track humanoids works the same as find minerals/herbs or fish. Those abilities range are lower then /tar or visual range.
---
The moment bgs come out it's gonna be back to standard pvp server life.
---
Phase 2 launch went less bad expected for me, probably because I happen to be horde.
---
Goodbye!
---
Unfortunately that is how it is in MMOs in today's age. Unless Blizzard actually makes guards insanely strong, people will always kill at flight paths and towns if they can get away with it.
---
It is the whole min/maxing reading of guides of today vs. how people just sorta played games back in the day for the most part. And yes, some people min/maxed back then but it was a much smaller percentage and the 14 year olds were not doing that.
---
The moment someone doesn't tell his/her region, you know it's an american?
---
I'm 49 and I'm having a good time. It's nice to actually get ganked sometimes, it was far too peaceful previously.
---
Now imagine this but a 30:70 split. There are zergs of 60’s in level 30-40 zones because the high level ones are empty, even though the kills bring 0 honor.
---
This is nothing like vanilla.
---
trust me everyone does this, i cant even solo honor farm in hinterlands without ending up in a 1v3 and i dont expect to fight  1v1
---
Guys on alliance and horde on westfall, faerlina, noggen all do this too.
---
So, we have our melee over where Majordomo dies, then our tanks directly across from there, and we put our feral druid at the side of Rag, about equidistant to the tanks and melee.
---
If you stealth outside of targetable range, spy will not be able to pick you up until you unstealth.  It will only give a stealth warning if the rogue stealths in range.
---
You should quit if it's miserable. Is only game.
---
Well, it’s a sword. Not a dagger
---
Yeah, this kind of mindset is part of why Penn and Teller created Desert Bus. Just because it's "realistic" that doesn't make it fun. 
---
The game is not fun right now, even if I appreciate that this might be what total warfare looks like. 
---
Some classes and specs can have fun in PVP. My spec (Holy Paladin) isn't really one of them. Doubly so when there are Horde raids camping every Alliance flight point in a disputed territory.
---
You cant target stealth.
---
Spy is still cheating but its not able to increase actual stealth detect.
---
What Spy is, is RADAR+wallhack.
---
You can see and target everyone in a large radius around you, through terrain and walls. You can also be alerted if some one enters/leaves/or actively is stealthed around you. But no, you cannot directly target people in stealth if you cannot normally detect them.
---
Yes, world PVP is shit 99% of the time. When arena and battlegrounds come then you'll get fair pvp.
---
I don't want to quit. I want to play the game in its fun form. Honor was a mistake in Vanilla and it was a mistake to repeat it in Classic.
---
I feel like it's about pressure moreso than boredom
---
What the actual fuck. No.
---
Bottom line: A lot of people expected Vanilla PVP-Servers.
---
What we got are extremely overpopulated one-sided faction servers that have done nothing to address either the problem of faction imbalance or overpopulation in any seriously effective way.
---
If you played Vanilla through Wrath and basically the end of W-PVP you all know that this wasn't what it was like.
---
I remember Vanilla WoW. PVE servers rarely had PVP, and PVP servers were always much more fun.
---
But you were never, ever, completely incapable of going to any single 30+ zone without finding a group of the enemy faction camping every flight path and area.
---
Capital cities did not have 50+ people attacking them every few hours *a day*.
---
Vanilla was *never* like this. The servers were *never* intended to house this high of a population and *because* of the massive imbalance, the problem is now fucking *glaring*.
---
But many people could not have forseen this problem. Most people probably thought that Blizzard had it under control and raised the server population cap reasonably and not to *utterly fucking broken.*
---
IMO this is 100% on Blizzard for increasing the max server population with no fucking thought about what it would do to PVP servers.
---
PVP Veterans are seeing this shit and giving up. People who played hardcore in the original WOW days.
---
And people want Blizzard of 2019 to make Classic +? Fucking L.O.L.
---
Sort of. I am assuming that nobody genuinely enjoys corpse running all day without actually playing the game. Because that's the environment that the Honor system creates for people who aren't yet level 60, or who are in the minority faction on their server.
---
That’s not how sunk cost fallacy works. 
---
Forcibly removing my ability to play my 300 hour character is not equivalent to me deciding to switch to alliance on my own for personal reasons.
---
If you're willing to pay attention in dungeons being a tank is nice. People are desperate for them and will be patient with you. Tanking your forst dungeon at lvl 60 is not ideal, you'd want to do it with guildies ideally, which is your problem.
---
I am talking about leveling as a healer mostly. Curriently I am lvl 57 druid tank, but I've been healing on lvls 35-39 (SM, Uldaman) and 42-48 (ZF, Mara). Usually I started evening with seeking out 1-3 mages who can conjure max lvl water, that I can use in stacks and gave em some tip or was gifted several stacks for free. I repeated this untill I got about 120-200 pcs of water, then headed to dungeons and drunk at every possible moment, while being able to heal even groups of 2 arms warriors and 2 warlocks (constantly using hellfire and tap) lvl 40 while being lvl 36 in SM Cath.
---
You just need to move ahead during combat, so when it ends, you are drinking you gain extra seconds to do it and convinient range for healing spells, when your group makes next pull. This means you can finish drinking while new combat starts, because you can allow tank HP to be at 70-85% so your healing spell crits would not go to overheating.
---
Cancel your sub now and then re-up when BG's are out.
---
Because hardly anyone used mods like this in vanilla.
---
Not me, or anyone else I knew, as with all the others in this thread. 
---
Stop playing dumb and feigning ignorance to justify your bad self cheating.
---
You sound butt hurt as hell. That’s embarrassing. Your calling the guy out on his opinion while spewing your opinion. Lmao now that’s highly embarrassing.
---
Oh THEY aren't having fun? Oh gee. Well MAYBE if you're being griefed constantly and repeatedly by roving death squads all over the place to the point where you literally CAN NOT DO ANYTHING  then MAYBE you should clue in on the idea that THAT is fundamentally NOT a positive experience for those ON THE END OF IT.
---
Maybe for THEM the game is being ruined. And MAYBE if you actually gave a fuck about the longevity of the game you'd clue in on THAT pretty quick.
---
This is not in anyway PvP and many of the people who chose to roll on a PvP server did not roll for this. Vanilla PvP servers were never like this in any way whatsoever, and I know that from first hand experience KID.
---
This is nothing but a mindless griefing shitfest all over the place, constantly. It's so bad it's completely ruining the game and all so little edgelord shits like yourself get to feel empowered in the only environment you can.
---
&gt;its literally 9000 vs 3000.
---
I'd imagine a much smaller portion of that 3000 are bothering to go out into the world anymore than the 9000.
---
No. Most leave you alone until the high 40s. Even then, BGs will prolly be out by the time you get there if you start now.

Lvl 44 now, been gankee max 2 times since starting so not much. Still regret pvp server. Just dont have the time to involve myself in it anyway.
---
It changess the nature of being in the world incredibly. You know whem you are safe or in danger in a zone and at the same time it's much easier to hunt someone down.
---
Both sides want something that the other considers game-ruining.
---
Yep, there's not much point in doing PvP on bigger scale than it was in phase one and once hype over phase two launch dies down, we will be back to those levels.
---
That said, being on a fairly balanced server, I'm loving the atmosphere this has brought. Nowhere is safe and it feels like actual war where factions are fighting over control of certain neutral flight points and overall zones with constant back and forth. The reward isn't some stupid blue gear but ability for your hundreds of you people to level and get to dungeons safely.
---
You dont have to stack with melee, you can stand left of boss (from melee stack point of view) and that way you cant chain with either tank or melee. You can still Shred perfectly fine from there and you still have to follow the call as usual melees to move out (go to the end of ledge behind you) unless tank resists Rags knock.
---
&gt; Play in a few months once it calms down.
---
Or just play on a pve server if you don’t want to pvp? Pretty simple solution that allows them to play right now. Maybe you should do the same if you find it miserable.
---
On my server it’s the Alliance that roam in death squads camping everything.
---
Idk I severely disagree. There's a few brackets of 5 levels where the talents certainly aren't that impactful, but I loved the last 10 or so talents as I felt I had the most flexibility with them if I actually bothered to read a guide about my class and not just blindly copy the cookie cutter shit.
---
Well, we're currently sat at a total population of around 1.8mil. Back then it took over 3 years to reach a million.
---
I'm actually quite enjoying the current pvp but it is absolutely worse than it was in vanilla.
---
Projecting much?
---
Go back to retail.
---
I said this multiple times before launch when people claimed “nobody cares about specs in vanilla, you can raid with whatever!”  As if guilds wouldn’t all try to min / max the best raid comp -_-
---
You're better of 3-5 manning if you're gonna raid a warehouse

Laughs in [Orkish]
---
&gt;How could i possibly without spy pinpoint exactly how many horde are outside the BRD entrance, while running on the surface level of searing gorge
---
By looking at your combat log and seeing how many names are zipping by. The same way Spy does. I'm not saying you would, just saying you could.
---
Horde was a better experience in terms of not getting swarmed compared to how alliance is going for me now.
---
Save that for a blind. The rogue can just gouge and re bleed you
---
Vanilla was *never* like this. Ever. Server populations are way bigger.
---
'Spy' still alerts on stealth. Since its a 'buff' spy detects it, not just when it is cast.
---
Rogues even camping the zeppelins killing everyone as soon as the zone changes
---
To me it just looked like you were bragging about your little gap year.
---
Zug zug
---
Not likely. If I cancel, I'm going to find something else to fill my time. I'm not here to wait for the game to become playable again. They need to fix it (or open up PVP -&gt; PVE realm transfers) -- now.
---
For real I love seeing those
---
Right, but there is no real easy way to determine whether you're keeping aggro because you're doing good, or because the dps is good at not taking aggro. Everything is, mostly, dependent on everyone else in the group.

---
You literally complained several times, and stated we should punish all horde because of your negative gameplay experience, even though your proposed solution would create a significantly worse outcome for those players. Its a cancerous talking point and it makes the situation worse. 
---
Me pointing that out is not emotionally driven. My language or points hurting your feelings does not equate to me being emotional, unless you consider the act of responding is in itself an emotional response. Then sure.
---
Did you want points towards a solution? Because that’s pretty easy. 
---
Free faction swapping to lower pop faction. 
---
Free server transfer to lower popped faction server. 
---
Transparent horde/alliance ratios. 
---
Incentives to join lower popped faction.
---
Potential alliance pvp rework, but people will resist this.
---
Release cross server BGs. 
---
Restrict honor level window to within 3-4 levels to assist leveling. 
---
Free transfer to pve for players not enjoying the servers, once balance is addressed. 
---
The solution should be a carrot, not a stick.
---
I’m also on the losing end of a skewed server, by the way.
---
It's not
---
Sure when a fury is tanking they might not out dps a rogue. But a fury has that option to tank, a rogue is just dps. A warrior can do either better than a rogue.
---
It wasn't exactly like this. There are 10x more people allowed on the server than in vanilla. This leads to overpopulation and everywhere being camped. Not enough people in vanilla to continously camp towns 24/7
---
They might be using a cheat called 'spy'.
---
The other guy got it slightly wrong, it *does* detect active stealth. It does not allow targeting of stealth outside of detect range.
---
What is happening is spy is telling them that [you] are stealthed in range of them. They can then use any detection abilities they may have to see you and target you.
---
what are you talking about?
---
Shadowmeld*
---
Its unplayable atm. I hate it.
---
&gt; Even in the best case scenario it’s just people standing around in the trenches
---
Hillbrads trench raids are the actual worst case scenario. It's bad honor and bad fun and I've been avoiding them since day 2. Fights between smaller groups are the best case scenario.
---
Because there is no cooldown. PPM in vanilla doesn't work like retail you retail player

Leveling warlock, I'm lvl 48. Been spec'd into Affliction. Since P2 is out I've been running ZF non-stop. Dungeons seem to be the most efficient exp now. Should I re-spec into Destro or Demon? My gear right now has 130 shadow dmg but I dont mind spending a little for different gear if it is optimal. Affliction has been great for solo lvling but now the gank squads make that real slow so I've been avoiding it. Thanks in advanced for your advice!

In other words, _you_ might have been ignorant in 2008, but the internet was not. This addon has been a staple for PvPers as long as WoW has existed. That doesn't make it good. You can argue its bad. Trying to argue its a 'new' bad is foolish, and wrong.
---
Or did't they? Having Will of the forsaken and extra dot on shadow priest is rather broken as well.

I logged my toon off in Winterspring at lvl 56 with the innkeeper. every time I log in after the honor patch I die. I gave up, unsubscribed and now just gonna see if Blizzard fixes this or not. Bye wow classic for now, it was fun as long as it lasted. Impossible to level to 60 now, impossible to get to the dungeons to get BIS gear etc..
---
Only thing you did wrong was stay in the group past the rookery.
---
Also, the bosses have names. Just because they are bad guys doesn't mean they don't have feelings.

How is this addon not banned by Blizz yet?
---
Or ending up in a situation where your faction represents 10% of the server population. But guess we should just take a transfer to a dead server and be happy, right?
---
If you pull on golemagg at 60%, your tank is shit. Pulling on rag is a different problem due to him having a complete threat wipe every knockback.

You can do it by going hard on ambush spec and grinding beasts with +beastslayer enchant while getting decent gold with skinning. Obv backstab doesnt work without gouge like in this video.

Truth. I don’t fuck with other flower pickers. Not worth the battle.
---
So honest question... Besides to be a complete asshole, what's the point in killing me (47) as a 60, let alone camp my body for 30 minutes.
---
Are people trying to get others to quit so that way the game dies? People are so geared while doing this, so I assume they ENJOY the game... Why go ahead and ruin it for someone else thus pushing people away from it...
---
Look at it this way. More normal people want to watch it for entertainment. Much like a freak circus.
---
If it makes you feel better we ruined thunderfury horde lives today in a raid vs raid battle in south shore. Wiped them for an hour, I got 400+ HK kills. Was very satisfying.
---
I don't know where this  'no changes' thing is coming from the moment they didn't cap server at the 2k or so that was classic they completely changed the game what we are playing now has little to do with classic wow
---
Not if you go PVE
---
I just love wpvp as a rogue, one of my favorites. However leveling a second character is near impossible now. Since people are still roaming with 40 man raid groups. This is the only downside so far I’ve seen
---
no but do yourself a favor and dont play on a pvp server, you can still do a lot of pvp on a pve server
---
I do the food thing too!! While leveling my warrior tank I kept my cooking proficiency up to date and would share my stam/spirit food with dungeon members. It felt nice being able to take this profession I was initially leveling for personal reasons and then have my party members share in the fruits of my labor
---
I dont think it will calm down until we got BGs.
---
Rogue if solo, warrior if you have healer friends.
---
Well, for the first raid, everyone is new. Gold bid doesn't increase the average wealth of the raid, only redistributes it. If people in gold bid raids are richer than average, it's because some of them prepare for the raids by earning more gold (which some people see as a disadvantage of gold bid).
---
Onus probandi mate.
---
&gt;Right, but there is no real easy way to determine whether you're keeping aggro because you're doing good, or because the dps is good at not taking aggro.  
---
Use DPS meters and call out DPS who aren't pulling their weight. If dps is high and they don't give you time to get aggro say "hey guys give me like 4 seconds to get aggro." If they refuse or don't listen you can leave and have a new group in less than 3 minutes.  
---
&gt;Everything is, mostly, dependent on everyone else in the group.
---
As a tank who pugs 95% of the time, I've never felt that my success depended on the rest of the group unless they were pulling on their own or trolling. As long as dps was decent and the healer could keep up, there have never been major issues. Knowing pulls, line of sight, and spamming battle shout does most of the work.
---
Run ST
---
t. Avasa
---
BIS race atm
---
It's probably going to take you nearly a month to get to level 50ish, so don't let the current clusterfuck influence your decisions too much as it's almost guaranteed to be cleared up by the time you reach the levels it actually matters.
---
But right now the only ways to get EXP without getting camped is to either play on a PvE server or to live inside dungeons after about level 25~30.
---
Does it make you feel in control?
---
Make your own group and start arena/anger/golem farmruns. You should easily find 3 people going for the other BIS Items. Sometimes you also find a shitty geared 60 as a fifth player that could use the other scrap as upgrade. Just make clear which items are reserved in the beginning. Farming HoJ with loot competition is pretty much useless.
---
You are lying or misremembering. The servers are 3-4x more populated now than they were in Vanilla.
---
it shouldnt be too hard, since anyone who has classic gametime also gets access to retail, it's just a matter of downloading it and creating a char. Well worth it to avoid being banned, because they catch a ton of gold buyers.
---
Should have leveled faster or not roll on a pvp server if this angers you.
---
Level an alt until the wpvp hype is gone (this or next week) and then go back to your almost 60. (and maybe try to find different leveling options)
---
"While in aquatic form you can right click other player's bobbers and steal their catch"
---
Show up on time, be social and friendly in comms, don't whine about loot.
---
If you can manage those three your guild will never replace you.
---
If thats what makes a PvP server a PvP server, why wasn't it like this before?
---
Because I was able to play the game before. Like I was able to in Vanilla. I have never seen anything like this.
---
Yeah, you're not entitled to gear.
---
This exposes a racist.
---
Get the word out there
---
I played PvP in Vanilla and I loved it. I loved the constant threat of danger punctuated by a bit of action that resulted in a victor who normally continued on with what they were doing. Yeah there were greifers but they were easily avoided if you saw them coming and there was always another zone you could go to.
---
My experience the last few days has been a waking nightmare. I literally can't even turn a quest in or take an unguarded flight path without being killed several times by the same people. I had ONE quest to turn in at LHC in EPL and died 3 times before I had to hide, res and hearth out. I never did get to turn that quest in.
---
I cancelled my sub on Friday and I won't be renewing unless I'm allowed to transfer off to a PvE server. I might continue playing if BGs are added but it seems that the alliance on my server has gotten the taste for blood. Previously they would camp and grief because they were bored but now they're actually *incentivized* to do it.
---
The whole tone of the server has gotten extremely toxic and retaliatory now as well where each group escalates the greifing and justifies it with the actions of the other group. It's made the whole game completely unplayable. Vanilla WoW was known for its long quest chains, long flights, long runs etc and now everything takes 5x longer if you can get it done at all.
---
Yeah you are. Sorry it’s frustrating to grind for loot.
---
Just because something similar existed before, that doesn't mean the addon isn't inherently broken and shouldn't be banned.
---
EDIT: added n't
---
Stop walking alone to dungeons. Meet your group in cities and take flights at the same times, or ride along. Gankers think twice if they see a full group.
---
8 Slot Bags?!
---
They wont even be able to hold half their tears
---
Hush, you are talking sense. You'll trigger the ganker's feelings.
---
Even as horde on Shazzrah EU I was ganked by level 60s approximately 30 times while questing from 49 to 53 this weekend. I can't imagine being alliance.
---
The people who insisted we needed a separate wPvP phase "because it's the best thing about Vanilla". Blizzard should've never listened to this very vocal minority, and should've just gone with the initial phase plan.
---
You said it wasn’t against retail TOS, so I could technically ask around in trade chat in retail to find someone?
---
Here I am, very glad I rolled on the quietest server around! LFG might be difficult at times, but we don't have to deal with as much of this shit!
---
So you’re telling me dude winning two separate shoulder upgrades over my net 0 is entitled?
---
Their game was balanced and designed with an upper bounds to population being a fraction of what it is now. It doesn't work very well with a massively increased server population. They could easily fix that via the method I described.
---
I think that's more "your complaints are basically 'I am on a PVP server' ". Alliance should be making raids to counter Horde
---
If you think it's "literally impossible" I've got some news for you, you need to learn to play this shit right. Or ding 60, if you're below 60 I feel you and there is no cure for your problems other than levelling.
---
But if you are at lvl 60, it is not impossible to play the minority faction. Gather up a small group of friends, find a choke point and rack up those kills. Or gather a full raid and go retake BRM or TP. Sure, landing in TP can be pretty bad, and getting into BRM might be pain in the ass, but I'm assuming you are on a pvp server because you enjoy pvp, so then you should embrace the fact that you have an abundance of hordies to kill. You just gotta go about it the right way. I had a blast yesterday when me and 4 others held the road form Kargath to BRM. So many hordes running through and as long as you dodge the full raids you can farm honor very efficiently.
---
And no, they don't "instantly organise". You have just been in the same spot for too long.
---
I'm not saying life as the minority is perfect, but people need to stop making this out to be the end of days. It can be a ton of fun and for PvP I'd rather me the minority.
---
&gt;game for them because THEY arnt having fun. Selfish carebears that just need 
---
then wow classic will die
---
😊
---
You are yes. Get over it
---
the fuck are you saying dude, you are literally the only riled up person in this thread
---
Ex-daggerspine? I never left sucka me and the other 3 people haha.
---
So far being ally on my server in the 50s is very difficult. Questing is impossible due to a raid of horde swarming you within a couple minutes of rez which is actually hilarious to watch. And running to an instance to at least grind the mobs for hours upon hours with a group takes about an hour of corpse running to reach. But can’t blame the opposing faction, honor is honor, May have to quit until it dies down lol
---
100% agree.
---
Yeah can just be time consuming and can also impact the smaller factions ability to get materials. Also I feel like large battles are just aoe fests and rogues can't compete when there's that many HKs going around
---
then start playing eve online, get a titan and see how your heart will go then !
---
100% this. I couldn’t have said it better.
---
But sheep are world renown for their amazing healing factor.
---
&gt; Because the rare pvp gear only comes in phase 6 there's very little point to go for ranks past 6 for normal players
---
It does? Because I wasn't able to confirm this anywhere and many BiS guides have blue pvp gear in them. If it's so then people farming honor for more than a trinket is even more hilarious, since no one with a job or school is going to get the epic items.
---
It's cringe but pretty much the only way
---
Stop yelling at us.
---
Is running dungeons as healer for greed rolls/greys a good strategy to make money for epic mount?
---
PVE servers don't have faction restrictions, you can make a character on the other faction and talk to people lol
---
Yes you are the asshole
---
Is it really a good idea to get a wand that does the same type of damage (fire, frost, arcane) as your Moveset/spec? Like if you’re fighting mobs that resist fire, and all your output is fire damage, you’ve got nothing.
---
The most needed role is always tanks.
---
Not riled up. At all. Told a dude to calm down and got the internet police on my back.
---
Is it cause I used the fuck word? Does that make me look angry? Or is it cause I am responding to people?
---
.
---
I like fucking with people guy...
---
Some people can't tell a shitpost account when they see ome.
---
Thats why you play on hydraxian waterlords
---
And 14 days after battlegrounds launch people will ask for the option to join battlegrounds from anywhere via the UI.
---
Trust me, the cycle repeats :)
---
You're both assholes.
---
So what?
---
Serious as finishing the raid 3 seconds faster? Are we really talking about min max raiding in classic?
---
Oh no, from vanilla to wotlk this was 100% a bug and using it would have been exploiting it. 
---
Now in Classic, it's a reimplementation of a bug that existed back then as a part of the feature-set for WoW: Classic. 
---
By no defenition is it a bug in Classic, but a recreation of a bug turned feature.
---
Wow! A mage with good aoe damage. How!
---
How do u get light of elune?
---
The entire pvp system in WoW offers no real rewards and only titles. The pvp gear you get in classic is pretty much crap unless you get to rank +13. In a tier or 2 it will also be sort of crap.
---
This guy is a horde player on Herod who thinks the server is dead off peak times. Need I say more?
---
Does Shimmering Flats have an Inn?
---
I got 16 on a rogue who just did quests and minor leatherworking  at 55 :/
---
Blizzard fucked this all up! They *allowed* faction imbalances by not offering faction queues or faction specific server transfers till it was way too fucking late. 
---
They did not open enough servers in the first place and as a byproduct and let *everyone* make characters on those servers way beyond the server population cap so everyone was stuck in 5 hour queues so they made server population caps higher which fucked the PVP system because the game world was never large enough to house so many people trying to W-PVP.
---
And they've done very little to change these problems or roll anything back.
---
They fucked this up royally. They have no fucking support system have you ever tried to get a GM to do anything that the Blizzard Website doesn't already do they are more useless than a fart in an elevator.
---
You think Blizzard who fucked this all up can make a *good* Classic +? Fuck right off they would shit the bed the same way they did with an already existing game that was well loved.
---
And congratulations you also sentenced mom and the cub back home to death cause pappa tiger ain’t coming back from this hunt.
---
Classic threat meter addon. Can watch threat in real time
---
Maybe it also has something to do with the servers being 5 times the size they were in vanilla?
---
Rogues are one of the few classes enjoying this phase.
---
Do you remember the name?
---
...you can install this too you know?
---
Nah, I'm good. I'm enjoying myself here.
---
yea those OG guys help a lot. I love to see " can craft on xx server" on recipes pages
---
On my server its pretty even, maybe even alliance heavy. I have given up questing there, as i get jumped by teams of 3+ alliance... Only ones who go for me alone are warriors and rogues that i cant do much about...
---
It's actually hilarious. They could just play on a PvE server if they can't deal. But no, baby wants their PvP server and their bottle waaaa lol
---
Especially considering how heated the community is rn
---
By the sounds of it there aren't a whole lot of players there to identify with, hence the crz in the first place
---
At what point does dungeon cat dps become unviable? Or does it not?
---
Yeah this except the vast majority of servers are Horde dominated.
---
Speaking personally my guild would be very willing to transfer to the other faction and I think a decent amount of people would as well. A lot of people’s friends have quit the game as well, which may also make people less attached to their current faction. But yes I agree with some of the things you have said since people would actually have to want to transfer and they may not, which we will never know till they try it, or put a survey out.
---
Not sure about your server, but on ours every last corner of Silithus was hot well before honor
---
On the french side, there is only 1 PvE serveur and we are seeing more and more people transfering from the biggest french PvP serveur saying it's litteraly unplayable. 
---
Funny note : French always had hard PvP culture, on retail and for a long time there was a PvP serveur (archimonde-FR) known even by non wow player for the hardcore pvp environment.
---
How would you have changed that? PvP server is PvP server after all. Sounds like a problem that could've been solved by rolling on a PvE server.
---
&gt;Yes it must suck to be on an **unbalanced** server or be between lvls 48-59 but we all made the *choice* to play on a PVP realm. 
---
Are you pretending or are you actually this dumb?
---
Where is our SM port blizz!??
---
Good depiction. I have always thought that killing these guys and trying to justify it with "kobold infest" is kinda racist. Something like alt-right but you do it officially. They just want to live in peace with their candles...
---
This was really well put!
---
cant the same exact argument be made for any other "feature" that WAS NOT IN VANILLA AND SHOULDNT BE IN THE GAME?
---
faction changes- our inability to know what we want means we have to spend 200hours to reroll, please let us pay you to skip that.
---
race changes- our inability to know what we want means we have to spend 200hours to reroll, please let us pay you to skip that.
---
pvp to pve server transfers- our inability to know what we want means we have to spend 200hours to reroll, please let us pay you to skip that.
---
post creation character changes- ...
---
i remember just 4 months ago the tiniest of change would have us seriously worried about the game we love. there was always doubt about wether or not blizzard is just trying to sell some prestige server to us as "authentic vanilla experience".
---
and now you are ACTUALLY ASKING blizzard to add those features.
---
this sub grew from 50k to 400k and the change in approach to classic REALLY shows i guess.
---
for all our sake i hope history doesnt repeat itself and us vanilla and oldschool wow fans are not again forced to play on private servers.
---
Zero honour, not negative
---
It’s a joke idiot
---
There many marketplaces around,  for some people gold selling is pretty handy, i know few small gold sellers, they doing it for like side job. No botting or hacking just straight boring farm.
---
The same reason blind doesnt last 45 seconds ona player but it does on a mob, abilities work differently in pvp and always have
---
Honestly it's gonna die down in like 2 weeks tops after everyone realizes how hard it is to get rank 14
---
Reading is hard it seems.
---
Pointing out how irrelevant his option is regarding how other people wish to play is quite a bit different from an opinion. Its merely an observation. 
---
OP is butthurt. You seem to be too. It's ok, I'll just head off to sleep and let you rage more
---
The 40 hordes camping lights hope fp on my server apparently
---
Its not 5%, its more than double of the shadow.
---
Besides MC is easy now, it will get "harder" (its more of a DPS race).
---
Also I rather not spend 3h in MC when I can only spend 40min in it every week. You will do MC until the end of time.
---
Likewise as a tank, I've noticed that healers sitting and drinking past 100% mana is probably tabbed out on youtube, or what ever.
---
Alliance did this to me yesterday. Killed me as soon as the boat zoned.
---
Trap share dr with scattershot.
---
I realize this, but it was never 6 seconds man. Did they change how cc interacts in PvP at some point down the road.
---
Yea sure. Danger is one thing, but walking on a pile of skeletons is another ;)
---
On my 55 warlock I'm on 7+ days /played. 
---
I'd say 15/16 days is on the long/slow side, but who cares? If you're having fun, you're doing it right. There's no real 'falling behind' as most hardcore guilds cleared all the raids within the first few weeks anyway.
---
No man, you should have done your research and predicted which 2 of the 18 PVP servers would be ally dominated so you would be able to play the game. All the private server players were telling you this would be a problem, wasn't it obvious to roll Heartseeker?? All the signs were there for you to predict that herod/skeram/stalagg would be 70/30, just look at the vanilla data and do some calculations and you can clearly see. KRAPPA
---
Happened on Earthfury as Horde a couple days ago. It's almost like the Alliance can make groups just like Horde can 🤔🤔🤔
---
It's not in terms of speed. Did you have fun?
---
&gt;They did ban the lfg add-on, and the census add-on lol
---
They are neither banned nor broken. The LFG addon is fairly useful if you want to look for a particular dungeon without having to monitor three different chat channels. The Census can't run automatically, you got to handle the /who queries manually, but otherwise it's the same.
---
EDIT: Ah, you're the "Blizzard knows more than you" guy. They sure did...not.
---
Imagine a mmo with actual consequences to death, like item look.
---
jUsT dOnT pLaY hAlF tHe GaMe
---
Yeah, some servers need a quick and decisive action like this. In this case, forget \#nochanges otherwise you will soon have \#nogame.
---
So you want them to break combat log since it takes information from there? (Hint, they won't.)
---
8bags wtf... pve players this broke?
---
I imagine you typing this furiously with a huge grin in your moms basement
---
or we are playing with a coordinated group instead of pugging all content. im on a horde dominated server aswell and im having prettymuch none of the problems you people post about.
---
wPVP as a night elf hunter on a ~35:65 A:H realm has been great fun in STV. Prowl+shadowmeld make for nice ambush opportunities and lets me pick my fights. 
---
One time I chased a mage across almost half the map, and when i finally got him to 2% he decided to suicide by mobs so I didn’t get the HK. Wasn’t even mad since it was a lot of fun
---
So much this. Been my experience as well
---
Same here, was hyped for GrobMob and all that.. but I'm hiding killing plaguebats behind hills when a 4 man finds me. The game is just dead at this point
---
This guy types like a dwarf...
---
&gt;The classicLFG is entirely different from what it was originally/assumed to be. 
---
It works as originally planned, the auto-invite feature was removed by the author.
---
You sure they were high level enough to grant you honor?
---
Sounds like you might enjoy creating some kind of content. Not to limit your possibilities, but YouTube’s a good place to start
---
The cock is feminine though so it's cool.
---
Why does it matter. As long as you enjoyed yourself, who really cares?
---
#nochanges
---
Right now. You jsut need to reach rank 7, 8 or 10. Rank 7 will take at least 3 weeks though, even when you are among the top pvpers of your server.
---
What addon shows the cool down on the target's portrait?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/LObxQ5v](https://imgur.com/a/LObxQ5v)
---
I haven’t heard these names in so long. Really brings back that nostalgia.
---
im playing balance/resto and duo'ing with a rogue.  its fun as fuck roaming around in stealth together
---
People act like the skill cap is infinite.  lol
---
I'm not saying that the gameplay is fun or rewarding for anyone, in fact I'm not trying to rank because of how boring it'd probably be. But the people that are trying to grind honor have to finds kills somewhere because they're competing with others in their faction. I'm not saying that the current situation isn't untenable or unsustainable, but the reality of it is that 60's need to lock down 40 quest hubs to grind honor because that's how PVP is built right now.
---
What do you get out of arena as a healer? The few groups I got in to for arena/angerforge runs would be so irritated if the healer wanted to do golem also. I just didn’t understand. I feel a lot of people have become so selfish. It takes like 10 more minutes to help the healer get some gear.
---
Be strong
---
You still need to reach to the dungeon. What do you do at 50+? Try crossing the blackrock mountain to get to BRD and come back convinces me this is still a good idea. Even going to Maraudon is a pain as you need to take the boat. The safest bet is the sunken temple at the begining of your 50, but will not be effective for long.
---
As a night elf player, all I can say is - beep-boop.
---
What? You can do arena grind runs as low as level 50.
---
53 is fine to do the actual arena event and dip into anger runs too.
---
This is exactly what happens to me. Bring a 5 to 10 man group. Farm about 10k honour a day. But after camping epl or winter spring horde show up and literally bring 60 ppl to camp us.
---
Free and paid realm transfers were available in vanilla.
---
Actually I do have a character at 60, but nice try
---
People looking up exploits on youtube so they could mass gank in goblin controlled towns without getting attacked by guards or players was absolutely not so commonplace in 2005.  
---
A handful of dudes or a raid group going to an instance want to camp a FP for a bit? sure; I remember all that. No problem. It is fun to play around those kinds of situations and an average person with an average number of friends playing with them can get some cool fights and experiences out of those moments. I remember many.
---
The same exact group of people staying there for 10+ hours ganking the same place, because they are streaming it to a viewership with viewers who are also swarming to gank in the area? No, not buying that for a second. I think that shit is toxic. I can't call for Blizzard to do anything about it, nor would I want to, but I think I just don't believe in playing the game like that.
---
I see there “must always be a bitch king”
---
Lol no offense. But no thank you. I did that shit like 5 times. That was plenty.
---
It's been available for 15 years, why would they ban it now?
---
Question I play on a PVE so I get world buffs and don’t have to worry, do you guys on PVP even attempt to grab them?
---
I like the wpvp and I'm on a hevalily horde pop server.
---
I knew what would happen this phase and prepared for it.
---
are you playing on a dominant faction per chance?
---
Yeah you could have rolled in a pvp server
---
What server are you on?
---
Soy (;
---
Friend tanks you played with and /w them when you need one
---
\/who warrior/druid/paladin in a couple of zones and /w them asking them to tank 
---
Join an active decently sized guild and ask there
---
I really can't believe it's that hard in a game where 50% of people play warrior
---
Because a medium pop server would have had a queue in vanilla.
---
Zerg guild. Get some more experience in pugs, watch some guides on youtube and find another guild. You'll be surprised how many guilds are recruiting, and their requirements are quite low (mine included).
---
Na, here maybe this will help
---
https://imgur.com/a/8uqoSu2
---
And missing all the fun? Hell no
---
Get a raid frame add on and a healing add on like clique.
---
It is a lot less effort so you can focus on more helpful things like interrupting, dpsing a bit, and wondering why the tank is staring at the next pack for 10 seconds before pulling every fucking pack.
---
not pvp to pve. ill edit to clarify, my bad
---
Yes, being in a stance as warrior counts as an aura
---
Just tank. Everyone on my server needs a tank for scholo...
---
&gt;Try to give them some time to adapt.
---
If 15 years wasn't enough, what will?
---
&gt; How many characters actually **shoot** as their primary role, let alone guns?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; All of them. 
---
You were literally wrong.
---
It's slow, I hit 60 with 6 days played. But who cares, it doesn't much matter which level you're at right now, nor when you hit 60 - the content is still gonna be there and be relevant when you get to 60. Besides, the last stretch is the most fun
---
Well when you put it like that, where is the invisibility addon?? After all Rogues can stealth you know!
---
blizzard dropped the nutsack on this and they need to hoist them the fuck up
---
I know, but I'm afraid that some people will have quit the game by then, and it's a lose lose for everyone.
---
I like being able to not fight in the first place by having shadowmeld :)
---
Fucking amazing idea. Thank you so much
---
Bro idk where you've been playing on Heartseeker. Sure, Alliance got Thrall, which is great, but in terms of overall world PVP the Alliance are getting mercilessly slaughtered, it's no contest. Horde control every zone I've been to including full control of Searing Gorge / BRD since phase 2 hit.
---
There a picture floating around with server numbers. There are about as many horde dominated servers as there are alliance dominated ones. I don't know how they got the info so I can't check the validity of the data. What I do know is that in retail in Bags no matter if I play Horde or Alliance general consensus was that the other side had more people, better organized, more no lifers than the one I'm on. In the grand scale in forums the same argument was repeated that it was way too one sided favoring one side or the other because all the devs only play xxxx race. 
---
Then meta data revealed that winning percentage was like 49.2/5.8.
---
emergent gameplay
---
Why not dungeons? It's what you're going to be doing at 60 anyway
---
NO!  
---
For raid:  
---
They share cd with runes :-/  
---
For dungeons:  
---
Well okay gimme some
---
Explain why and then leave
---
So now people are upset about faction imbalance?
---
Everyone told me to fuck off when I made multiple threads about this early on in the classic release, that Blizzard should have tackled this shit early and enforce at least 40/60 ratio on PvP servers
---
I rerolled my server after hitting 40 ages ago, because I knew it was going to be a shitshow, and Blizzard didn't give a fuck at the time and neither did the community on /r/classicwow.
---
Private servers enforce faction ratio.
---
Horde player of course pepelaugh
---
Got a link?
---
Don't think they need fucking DBM tho
---
The easiest and quickest way to farm gold is to never leave a major city.
---
Yeah sure I've heard that one before.  You probly don't even play classic at all and are a bot.  You realize you can't have multiple characters on different factions on the same server in classic.
---
Me walking to the front is usually seen as a go signal.
---
spy addon is the key word here.
---
Nothing worse than rezing for the 20th time and finding what feels like a secluded spot only to get pounced by the same ten lvl 60 whorde looking for you lol.
---
&gt; “I hit 60 in 4 days played time”
---
Noob. Every non-scrub hit 60 in four real time days.

Yes. Get ready for fun when you want to run BRD. Took me 8 deaths to get from Thorium Point to the instance this evening.
---
Coming full clean, as a zoophile I long for Horse Dominater Servers on Classic or Retail.
---
All game is broken, cmon, it's  slippery slope, no changes(but still changes lol)
---
I played on a PVP server from Vanilla to Cataclysm too. Went PvE this time around. No regrets.
---
Yes a little bit of FR is good for Rag. Once your raids dps goes up you'll take the FR off but for now it will help you survive the sons phase too. Don’t forget to frost nova :)
---
So are you saying that Blizz hasn't used player feedback while making retail over the years?
---
All the ones who aren’t shit and need a 2-3:1 advantage to win realize this.   
---
They say “why didn’t you roll pve then” without even noticing the irony that the basically are playing on PvE servers for their faction.
---
It’s not good for the game.  People aren’t just going to log in to be 24/7 honor farms. They’ll just spam instances or stop playing.
---
I don’t think it was a mistake bud
---
Well, you're wrong.
---
Ruins classic experience... Yes.. you know it was available back then and even more powerful?
---
Atleast theres no arrow anymore pointing torwards them.
---
I sure do! But I knew what I was in for. My friends weren´t. But they wanted the "real" WoW experience. Fun fact: They all quit.
---
I just hit level 10, I rerolled servers because my old one was 20-80 horde dominant
---
True, but I maintain! It is only second (IIRC) to Bonecreeper which drops off the last boss from Scholo—- which I may add is a long instance that no tanks want to do. Keep Icefury Wand just in case..
---
Follow up question: are you already pre-bis/bis geared? Once you get there it’s smooth sailing and you can compete. The problem is leveling 48-60 while at the same time being unable to find dungeon groups since everyone is either PvPing on their mains or not willing to take a 40-minute death walk just to get to BRD/BRS.
---
We sometimes do if we're feeling like taking the chance, but usually it's not worth it because getting PvP'd just kills like 2 hours of work.
---
Yeah, so I suppose that keeping things shit will leave everyone happy...
---
I would have prefer if there were no changes in the first place, but you can't perfectly recreate a 15 year old game without travelling 15 years back in time, and if you introduce some changes, it will introduce new problems that will require additional changes to fix.
---
The guy you responded to hasn't replied to a single comment of yours in this comment chain...
---
It's almost like there's more than one person with an opinion playing...
---
&gt; takes 0 skill
---
So that Venruki clip I watched where he takes out 3 rogues, that didn't take any skill? I KNEW IT
---
&gt; on an individual level
---
Wow it's almost like macro and micro scales dont operate the same. Develop new tactics.
---
I would faction change if given the option. +1
---
All I see is meme vomit
---
I’ll say this: I heavily use spy since my main was around level 35 in the first month. I’d never used it before, but I was noticing that even as a hunter with track humanoids on, I seemed to get jumped by the other faction and auto-targeted by people I couldn’t even see. This turned the normal world into this weird unreal glitch-fest where there was no skill for the user involved at all. Now, I’ve got it downloaded and use it constantly because it’s the only possible way I could even the playing field. I hate that I need it, and I would totally approve of it being disabled for everyone. The only thing I like about it is the kill on sight list, so I can remember all the d-bags out there and repay them at totally random times.
---
OP assumes player A is also player B.
---
Actually Alliance outnumber horde on my server, and it's a PvE server. It's just boring as shit because on a PvE server all you get is mindless blobs in SS/TM. 
---
Honestly at this point I would rather be on a PvP server...
---
It's so fucking easy man. Incentivizes people to roll a certain faction and maintains perfect faction balance without a problem.
---
I don't believe it's possible to transfer to a different sort of server (as in PvP to PvE and vice versa) like...at all. I'm sorry to hear of your troubles, but why do you think you're too low level for ST? I did my own ST run at 50. Isn't the highest mob in there (the boss) like 54 at most? I've definitely run dungeons where the boss was orange to me (fought empereror in BRD at 56).
---
Look at the pure auto shot damage, if he’s beating you there every fight without the bow you’re doing something wrong. If he beats you because of more AS/MS dmg then he’s simply using more pots than you
---
Cause they realize how dumb it is not to ban it after 15 years?
---
This is the answer. People abstaining from using it are making it worse. Everyone needs to use and abuse the piss out of it, otherwise it wont change. 
---
Honestly at this point people need to have it because you're fucked if you dont.
---
An easy comparison would be the heartbeat sensor in call of duty. Essentially everyone else has one and it's on all the time, and if you dont use it, you're of course much worse off
---
I'm not measuring anything, I'm telling you why I don't need to look basic OW trivia up. You're the one who seems to need to go into dick measuring.
---
There are debates online on whether the Earth is flat. The fact that someone somewhere has debated something doesn't necessarily mean the debate has merit.
---
Look, I'm not actually trying to be a dick. But Overwatch is an FPS, literally by definition. Many games are a combination of several genres, and it's possible to share multiple characteristics. Overwatch shares similarities with other genres, yes. Many games nowadays are a bit of a blur and can be classified in several different ways depending on what exactly you look at. However, the game's most basic core gameplay mechanic is that of playing in the first perspective and shooting/ engaging in combat with others. It can be an FPS RTS(I don't really think so though, the similarities are a stretch at best IMHO) but it is an FPS first.
---
Spy with mind Vision is so insanely op it's ridiculous.
---
Do you um. Do you understand how war works?
---
Lol, I re-rolled horde on a PvE realm after being fedup (level 54 on a PvP server...). Got 4 runecoth bags and 5 gold from a dude pretty much directly when I came to Orgrimmar.. :)
---
lol nice "get good" argument
---
I'm actually very happy with the game at this stage and I'm having the most fun I had in the long time, being on a well balanced server, but unlike you I can see past my own problems and the shit that people on heavily imbalanced servers have to deal with.
---
&gt; if you introduce some changes, it will introduce new problems that will require additional changes to fix.
---
Yes, this is what software development has been and always will be. No amount of plugging your ears and yelling **\#nochanges** will change that.
---
This would be a 20 minutes long Youtube video in 2019.
---
its the same concept of queues man, give it a week and a half and it'll blow over
---
aaaand the meme is dead
---
Yeah thats what I think about as someone whose on a PvE server too.... All those skeletons... I spend all that time getting my world buffs before the raid. I couldnt imagine getting to the portal and losing all that time/work to some stupid skirmish, lol.
---
As a warrior I have mixed feelings about the addon. It's a good early warning system as it lets me get away from potential rogue/druid gankers (against which im helpless). On the other hand, I cant hide behind hills or objects from other players either since they are also using the addon.
---
Yes, does this make a difference?
---
Same. Thottbot always felt more straightforward and more like the google of WoW sites.
---
Kurinaxx isn’t crazy horde dominated but they’ve certainly got more numbers, playing on Alliance this phase has been extremely fun.
---
Alliance racials are so bad they benefit horde more than alliance
---
50% faster honor gain for the horde
---
What fun? Afking in raids? Just wait til bgs, thats when the real fun begins
---
If you're dumb enough to not see the difference in PvP and massganking lowbies you're a waste of oxygen anyway.
---
RAs a 48 rogue recently being on the receiving end of MANY level 57+ hunters traps, level might play a role in it's length, because I assure you my ass is stuck for longer than 6 seconds
---
edit a word
---
“Wave”
---
Oh yeah no, turn that frown upside-down. Rogues taking that much time to hit 60 definitely makes sense. It's very slow, but rogues are slow, rough levelers and have a lot of built in side activities.
---
I was just wondering how in the world a warlock could fill that much time by level 54 while still actively focusing on leveling. I swear at least a third of his estimated time is from unnecessary traveling or non-leveling activities that can be forgone the next time around.
---
During vanilla I was in my mid-20’s and could easily compete in PvP as a mage, druid and warrior. I’ve found that my PvP skills are somewhat now diminished in my early 40’s and that, coupled with still learning to play a Shaman, has really made phase 2 quite difficult for me (beaten 2 vs 1 by a 45 Warlock against 53 Shaman and 48 Hunter, beaten 1 vs 1 by 51 Druid against 55 Shaman). 
---
It’s been a frustrating weekend, especially yesterday when my friends and I were camped in Marshals Refuge by a Priest/Warrior combo.
---
I can totally understand how people are finding this phase un-fun, especially if their server is heavily weighted toward one faction. For me I’m happy enough and I’ll keep playing and ganking when I can but for so many players still trying to get to 60 it was clearly a poor move to release world PvP at this point.
---
How so, lmao? Yall have really not come up with one actual reason as to why this dumbass addon should be in the game.
---
Huh? It took like one month for WoW to reach one million subscribers back in 2004. The peak of 1.12 was like 7 million players.
---
I absolutely love this. All the fucking snowflakes are downvoting you for speaking the truth. If you're on a PvP server, with Honor just released, what the hell do you think is going to happen?
---
Roll PvE server poor things, you're just not fit for PvP if you're crying about it.
---
I agree, world pvp is not fun. I do it pretty heavily as I'm a ret paladin and really need the pvp set for PVE, but I don't enjoy it all. We usually run around as a small raid of 8-12 people. 
---
99% of pvp interactions is either wiping the floor with solo horde players or small groups or getting rolled by a 25-40 sized raid. The amount of interesting, evenly matched pvp encounters we had I can count on one hand. 
---
Our MO basically consists off picking an area, farming horde until a big raid shows up then die/run for our lives and relocate to a different area. Considering our server is very horde-favored, the first part usually only lasts 5-10 minutes.
---
When my guild went to Onyxia yesterday, there were literally 250 horde camping the entrance.
---

That's pretty much how they've pitched it from the start.
---
see the game is supposed to be really about the PVP aspect, even though the PVE part seems better IMO, yet the PVP system is sort of ass unless there’s some sort of dueling arena i don’t know about. in the game’s complexity it sort of somehow makes fights still feel like button spamming. i was watching some of thst pro dueling series on twitch and it wasn’t terribly exciting. at all. it seems like most of the classes have a set game plan and nobody deviates from that. it’s just a game of keeping your distance or doing the exact opposite if you’re a melee class. i don’t mind the PVE part of the game but to be quite honest the PVP system is pretty shit, not to mention the subscription service is ass. i pay $15 a month for xbox live + game pass. now that’s too expensive but at least i get a shitload of games out of it. $15 a month for a game that is incredibly grind heavy and also doesn’t really have a set PVP system is ass. i don’t think it’s the games fault but a system where attacks are turned based could help IMO. right now it’s just “spam these three moves until one of you dies”. there’s very little play/counter play in even the PVE side. you know what i take it back it IS the game’s fault. the fighting system right now sucks ass. it’s just spamming.  making it turned based would feel more like hearthstone and also make it feel more like a skill based game, because it doesn’t really seem like it as far as i’ve played. if you’ve got better shit you’re probably winning. also what the **fuck** is this weird “miss” shit? the game is already a spam fest what’s the point of making it so lower levels can’t even hit the people who are ganking them because their level is too low? being even 3 or 4 levels behind the person you’re fighting gives them a decent advantage. it just seems stupid.
---
Clipped rotations. Also, study the logs.
---
Also, you WILL fall behind in damage to competent rogues and warrs. Not your fault. Class design. They already get several hundred AP on you from world buffs that don't grant melee AP, and have double scaling from agi and strength. It's just the way the game works. Just aim for best parses within your class.
---
I have not made any whiney reddit posts pertaining to wow try again
---
How many thousands of minutes are people going to be corpse walking just so you can get a couple bis? More realistically you barely get anything of value at all because only the neet's will be top rank in PvP to get the good shit.
---
Aww, you poor thing. How did you NOT roll on a PvE server with this whiny attitude?
---
I don't get on Reddit much so I don't normally reply to old comments but there's so many issues with essentially forced faction transfer using queue times as blackmail for the dominant faction its ridiculous, there's a reason this has never even been considered in WoW even after faction changes were to be allowed.
---
Fuck off retailtard
---
I'm not sure I understand why rogues are "the most important boss dps class"?
---
After the 2 main fury dw tanks and 1-2 fury dps that tank for specific bosses the rest of the fury DPS warriors will still outdamage the rogues and if something happens like a tank dying the fury wars can swap defensive stance and taunt.
---
We have a good amount of both rogues and warrior dps but if we were to suddenly lose 4 fury dps it would be a bigger deal than losing 4 rogues.

Spirit of Aquementas. It's second to only the Drakestone until you get raid weapons, which is a random enchant and incredibly annoying to farm.

Current best (frost) mage wand is Cold Snap. Might never be able to get your hands on it, though. It is pretty much right there directly competing with phase 6 wands from Naxx, though!

careful you liked this phase.... incoming down voters
---
It was always easy to fix. Decrease honor and xp and rep by 2% for every point over 55% of imbalance for the majority faction and have a warning at character creation “this faction is full, join [minority faction] to receive full rewards].
---
Offer high to low faction locked server transfers and even limited faction changes as needed.
---
People would balance out rather than lose 20% honor, rep and xp.
---
Lmfao u fucking loser, no you didnt
---
What do you mean? Now we can play the game.
---
Wasnt that the whole point of the video....?
---
Wow PvP isn't "brutal". It's fucking taxing and greifing. Other games with PvP there's a risk you take and most importantly a risk you make when you decide to kill someone. In wow they reward you for being a fucking cunt. How does that make sense?
---
Bis for who?
---
Most people who post on forums/reddit about pvp are from the unhappy crowd. The people who are happy with PvP are playing and dont care about posting.
---
For me phase 2 is a blast. Lots of fights on my server and quite balanced, bit alliance favoured but thats ok. More honor for me.
---
I think the problem is, that people do not adapt their playstyle. They think they can level in Searing Gorge without problems etc.
---
And how exactely will this transition happen, according to your conspiracy?
---
There are 31 heroes in the game. Out of them, 2(two) don't have a ranged weapon as their primary way of attack, but still have ranged capabilities. Yeah how dare I.

Doing the same dungeon over and over again is super boring, i like doing dungeons and getting BiS but if u are not in a guild that regulary do BRD runs u have to level up in world map
---
A dagger will always fit rogue better.
---
Rogue will always have more dps on single target, than fury war, even if that war is way better stuffed than the rogue.
---
Rogues that slack under fury war should check their rotation.
---
Fury war with perdi/CHT is non sense, they have access to way better weapon
---
There’s a reason it’s called the dead mines.
---
Cool but I don't remember asking?
---
The DPS of a "non buffed" Combat dagger Rogue with perdi+cht is way more high than full buffed dagger war fury
---
3 charges only though...
---
\^\^
---
I just got killed by Horde hiding on board the ship from Menethil to Theramore. A few Horde managed to kill a boatload of Alliance since people tend to go afk after boarding the ship. Pretty creative if you ask me.
---
Retail will continue be a sharded no man’s land where you can’t identify with other players. 
---
No matter what they implement to bridge this gap, the original principal that led us to like the game is completely gone.
---
At this point Blizz is using a defibrillator on WoW to keep it alive for a few more minutes at a time only for it to practically die between the shocks.
---
I played on a PvP server in vanilla and only had fond memories of it. I definitely underestimated 2019 gamer mentality and the server population. It has ruined PvP.
---
Because people join them.
---
These posts are getting dumber and dumber. Please continue
---
If it had been about the money then they would have gotten 10x more servers before launch.
---
Blizz fully expected Classic to fail.
---
Blizzard's approach was cross realm BGs, removal of honor system in the next expansion, flying mounts to avoid ground pvp, etc.
---
Either they are ridiculously stupid, or they did this on purpose to kill off classic and move the masses to retail.
---
Imagine not being 60 yet
---
Yes they create the group. Just dont join if you dont want too. 
---
I personaly hate when people reserve stuff in dungeons.
---
Yes and you would have to see if that is worth it or sit in a 2 hour queue potentially.  Depends on the total time you plan on playing in the future.
---
It's the same as being vigilant with your camera. Spy is like any other addon that is just quality of life.
---
Spoiler alert: they can't
---
What does this even mean?
---
For reference Herod has had many Alliance zerg guilds ( 30-40 raids ) that run around BRM EPL and winterspring killing everyone.  It's not actually as Horde heavy as reddit would have you think.  If you check the census sites the imbalance actually comes from low levels, the numbers at 60 are far more even.
---
Congratulations on that new job!
---
Oh and don't worry about wow dude. It'll be around for a while.

Missed opportunity for some hilarious sound effects. Maybe a slide whistle?

So much name calling for someone so unemotional. Nothing to really unpack here when all you did was mildly agree with me, then made assumptions to prove your points.
---
Only 8? Took me well over an hour yesterday.
---
Well I didn't ask you to read my post
---
I did it in 8 Days and i thought i was slow....
---
it would have been great, like, a WEEK into the game
---
if i get faction locked off my lvl 60 warrior that took like 8 days PT to level up to 60 because the "minority" alliance (45-55) camped me every level after 50, i'm just quitting.
---
i know that doesnt matter to the alliance. but it matters to all my friends, my guildies that i tank for, and, most importantly, to blizzard who gets my sub money.
---
faction queues are going to destroy the "community" of the game if they're implemented this late. few people will reroll, some will suck it up, lots will just quit.
---
Yup. Which is the opposite of free, which was my only point.
---
Literally the first fight you use Mangle which was TBC pre-patch. Rest of the video shows arena which was TBC.
---
Not saying the rest of your point is invalid but stating you were Warlord in Vanilla like it gives you clout and then linking to a TBC PvP video really diminishes your argument.
---
&gt;maybe at 60 it gets better  
---
I have some bad news for you. It never gets better. Even when you have BiS PvP gear and all the consumables in the world you still just get gang banged by 5 people at once. WPvP has no fair fights.
---
ST is recomended for 52-56 players. So people just wont take a 50 with. Or join a 50s group. Unless you're a healer since healers can be underleveled af
---
It's true; hunters level mining, priests level herbalism. I think we all know who's the most aggressive there.
---
It's funny how the whole 'horde is better for pvp' fad got us into this mess while dwarf priests and paladins completely make up for that. If not for sheer numbers, Ally would not have a disatvantage. Yet the whole thing is gonna get worse because more allies are gonna quit and the myth that horde is better for pvp will persist.
---
I'm rerolling on a PvE realm due to this. I am hoping that I will get into a nicer community without having to deal with toxic PvP nerds. I have to say that I in general like PvP, and have always played on a PvP server, but as the state is at the moment, the game is no playable for me. Luckily I am an altoholic, so cannot say I am suffering that much. 
---
I also realized (when now playing a horde char) how much better the leveling experience is for horde, which is a plus.
---
Gawt damn lol, I didn’t mean to get this in depth. I’m a filthy pleb casual but that’s a fantastic list. You da man! Thanks for the great fountain of knowledge!

---
Oh and when I was saying that earlier I meant Pre-BIS before raiding / world bosses!

They are either dumb or they are valuable they cannot be both

They dont deserve empathy even though they admit they were wrong about having no changes? you must be really difficult irl

Would be cool but I think pvp servers don’t let you have toons on both factions

its almost as if alliance people really dont like pvping

    /who Leonidas
---
The 3% hit and getting through the 1% hard coded miss was a welcome surprise to weapon skill, its not the reason it's so strong.
---
Weapon skill increasing glancing blow damage against bosses is the reason its the hands down best stat for melee
---
There's a fine line between organically meeting the opposing faction in world pvp and being camped to farm honor because BG's aren't open.
---
Even the random 60's in STV/hillbrad ganking lowbies is fine.  What's not fine is having 20+ people camp every major quest hub and flight point.
---
What is this Brazil reference about?
---
PLEASE don't add faction queues, blizzard.
---
all they have to do is release BGs and make them NOT cross server while keeping transfers open. that'll be a great way to balance out pops.
---
faction queues will destroy guilds and communities.
---
&gt;the only efficient way to rank is to run around killing people in groups of 5-10
---
Horde on my server doesn't care - they just want kills. They corpsecamp for hours despite getting pretty much 0 honor for it. They kill you right after you land, before "Honorless target" buff expires.
---
I'm not talking about random pvp in open world. I'm talking about what equates to griefing. It will only lead to one thing... a dead game. I don't think anyone wants that do they?
---
then why did you post it
---
It probably won't make you feel any better, but from the perspective of the ganker, you are both playing a game that you have both signed up to play under the same rules, which currently give them advantage over you and they would like to exercise that advantage as long as it lasts, possibly because they too were in such a shitty situation before. On top of that, you might have another layer as to why the person justifies it for themselves, faction RP, vengeance for being ganked earlier themselves, etc. Right now it might just be all the hype around PvP which makes people want to kill everyone in sight.
---
The person ganked has every right to be mad about it, no matter the ganker's reason, though I don't normally think of them as assholes. The real assholes kill you at the end of an escort quest.
---
In reality he is a 60 undead rouge named "YourMother" sitting in a 40 man BRM Raid, spitting on the 54 priests, hes oneshoting after they got hit by the 10th Frostnova
---
Oh hey, digging through peoples' post history for ammo. You have issues, man.
---
But, in the month since I posted that:
---
- We have gone from 3~5 layers down to 1, meaning that it's impossible for alliance to congregate on one layer where there's few horde.
---
- There has been another month for more alliance to hit 60 and accumulate gear, meaning that they're no longer hiding in instances 24/7
---
- Honor has been released, giving them an incentive to fight
---
You can be as condescending and underhanded about it as you want, but the reality of the situation is that:
---
- There's a horde-skeleton-paved super-highway leading from Kargath to BRM and there's nearly always large groups of alliance bunkered down in the canyon connecting Badlands to Searing Gorge killing everyone as they come across.
---
- WPL, Feralas, Burning Steppes, and Searing Gorge are camped 24/7 by roaming groups of alliance preying on levelers and people heading to dungeons.
---
- Earlier today, a group of alliance (2 rogues, 1 druid) spent hours globaling flagged people outside UC, as streams of unflagged 60s walked by them to their destination (mostly WPL)
---
The reality is, the situation has changed dramatically and even though alliance is outnumbered 2-1, the sheer size of the server means that there's enough of them that they can grind the game to a halt for any horde they find and can easily control areas far away from Orgrimmar.
---
I think many people did not know what a shitfest P2 would be on a PvP server. I (who always played on a PvP server) did at least massively underestimate it.
---
I played an Alliance alt with some friends on a weak faction server, first we didn't noticed the ratio and when things got worse we transfered to an Alliance advantaged server as soon as we could. And those who missed the time window also re-create a character on the new server. It didn't take them much time to level 60 again anyway, the coming days of classic are still very long so a month of leveling doesn't cost too much.
---
I mean ,no need to struggle with the unbalance of the server, it's Blizzard's job to deal with it (they suck at it though) and if they think 10:1 is ok then so be it. Players should protect their own interest with their feet.
---
No one saw it coming but the no changes crowd ended up being the worst part about classic.
---
I actually do this... It is only congested when theres a whole raid filling it up.
---
People who make these threads are usually too lazy to make their own group, and just want to join a group. I'm the one making the group, i'll dictate the rules beforehand. If you dont like it, then don't join.
---
They reserve the loot, and if people still join that's on them. Its the same as not inviting classes that need the same loot as you. It's not entitlement, it's just logic. Why would I fight over a roll for gear I need when I can easily invite people who wont roll for that loot? It's completely logical and sound.
---
It's literally a non-issue. Don't join their group, they could spend longer making the ground (depends on the dungeon), but then they wont have to fight over a roll. The others in the group can literally just leave at any point if they feel its taking too long to make the group.  
---
Why are you pissed off? You sound like the idiot to me, as are people who make groups where so many need the same drop that they do. Why would you waste so much time fighting over loot that you need?  
---
For almost every single piece of prebis that I had to farm, I reserved the item, and made the group easily. Wow crazy right, people still joined. Why? Because they dont need the same item.  
---
Just make your own group, literally. You sound entitled for wanting others to have to roll against others since you did. It's your own fault for being so short sighted, wasting your own time.
---
&gt;If you're Horde... you  can easily hit 40 with zero PVP
---
&gt;you get easily hit 25 without leaving safe zones as alliance
---
OK, 15 levels. Gap is even larger.
---
Why can't I hold all these limes?
---
No it doesn't, blue pvp gear is immediately available just like in Vanilla.
---
I would give up my Gouge, Kidneyshot, Sap or Cold Blood if it meant Death Coil would be removed in return. God do I hate that spell, but thankfully there is Shadow Reflector Trinket.
---
bis for druid tanks. Thanks about it.
---
Says he isn’t mad continues to rage comment on everything lolol
---
Same on my warrior, but I think that would be much slowee now with the amount of people questing. The 40s is absolutely chaos in the evenings.
---
You want WoW PvP to be turn based? That has to be the shittiest idea I have ever read.
---
Depends on which group finder you're referring to. The Premade Groups feature is, in my opinion, one of the few features Retail has added that I actually really like. It's a near-perfect group finder, the only flaws being that it operates off of cross-realm and it shows peoples' item levels. But both of those are easy fixes. If they added Premade Groups into a Classic+, I wouldn't have any complaints.
---
WrathLFG...yeah, no. Fuck that. The reason everyone hates it is because it gimps the dungeons so hard that they don't take a single ounce of concentration to do. And because it doesn't require any concentration, everyone else in the WrathLFG groups just actslike static AIs, so the experience boils down to "mob grinding but with extra steps." And if I wanted to grind mobs with no interaction with any other players, well guess what I'd be doing right now?
---
&gt;People seem to think community is spamming chat for 30+ mins to find a group.
---
&gt;Wait up to an hour to get everyone doing whatever to meet up at the dungeon because you have to wait until the last person shows up before heading there, then hope no one "has to finish up this quest first". Great fun.
---
Here's a tip: the friends list exists. Guilds exist. I've found tons of people in my time playing Classic who I've had a lot of fun running dungeons with because I found a fantastic guild, and getting groups together is easy and quick thanks to me having kept people I've liked questing with on my friends list.
---
World pvp would be fine, but we have giant server wide blood orgy instead.
---
This whole thing happened because Classic didnt launch with honor system and people had blue balls 2 months.
---
Then they release honor patch without proper place for murdering so now everyone suffers.
---
Cool Story Bro..i just dropped a deuce
---
Phase 2 is awesome.
---
Are any on alliance whitemane?
---
Well if you want to think that hard about something. See you in Shadowlands or not. Enjoy WoW!
---
Not do much rage as the curtosey of replying. What is the fun of it if there is no interaction? ❤
---
Next you'll be telling me that a magical fat man doesn't bring me presents in December each year.
---
Death coil is insta. Or are you suggesting a preemptive kick for the silence?
---
Any addon made "required" for fair pvp is a broken addon.
---
You can't believe it, but it's true. Did everything you said and it still takes a while. A lot of times group just disbands. Our server has wayyyyy to many healers.
---
Kind of on a side note here but... Any idea what base max rendering range is FOR ENEMY PLAYERS with all settings cranked up, and what the exact range of Spy is?
---
I rather have that than what I am dealing with right now as a priest. [Item] is *not reserved but you are not allowed to get it*.  
---
Gearing up god-awful mages doing subpar dps while still managing to fail decursing is reward enough apparently.
---
I try not to use addons as much I can but I guess it's needed for this.
---
I just want 3k players per server.
---
Alliance do it on our server too. It’s just a mob mentality. Nothing horde centric about it. 
---
They can’t really remove spy, it’s just not technically feasible without breaking every other addon too. It would be better to just lower /target distance to limit its viability. 
---
We can just disagree about faction queues. Being camped sucks, losing the ability to login completely is worse. 
---
How about buffing guards based on current player imbalance? Honorless kill debuff longer if you’re lower? Rez timers higher if you’re over? There’s ways to even the odds and there’s ways to incentivize balance without putting players in ten hour queues.
---
Hah! Yeah right dude....
---
If a human mage is out questing and get a notif that you're stealthing nearby they're just gonna pop perception, nova you, and then you're toast.
---
That was hilarious, I’m curious as to why you didn’t just kill him since he is a warrior :p
---
I’m not talking about restealth With improved sap I’m talking about how people drop combat after a gouge and manage to stealth again without using vanish. Unless this just isn’t a thing at all and being dumb
---
We roam as a 10 to 15 man raid on whitemane. Some great battles so far, only frustrating part is getting hit with superior numbers. Feel bad for anyone leveling.
---
I got some questing done tonight (I am 60) in EPL but it was around 11pm to Midnight server time.  That’s really the only time it’s remotely viable now and even at that point I was ganked going to turn a couple of the quests in eventually.
---
The issue is not the PVP - the issue is that servers have 10x more people on them than Vanilla did so the ganking now with that many people on an unlayered server is literally unavoidable.
---
Back in Vanilla with a fraction of the players there were PVP hotspots but a large portion of the map was still safe for playing.
---
*looks at my entire servers fastest MC clear times* not a single sub 1 hour clear. 
---
I guess my entire server is filled with scrubs, or you’re full of shit.
---
&gt; DKs
---
What does this mean besides Death Knight?
---
Because you can't control what other people do.  Your only choice is to make your own group.  Worry less about what other people are doing and do what you can do to make things work for yourself.  Something that's been lost in this current generation's culture is personal responsibility, always trying to make everyone else change to suit what you want.
---
I like this phase because it actually feels like war, you have to rethink how you level and raise your awareness (was level 53 when phase 2 hit, 55 now)
---
Been doing Arena / Angerforge a couple times a day for the last week or so, seen HoJ *once*, still no luck on Gladiator.. but then, my buddy had to do #164 runs for it. I’ve heard other say 200+ and counting... it’s enough to make you despair.
---
saying someone is slow as fuck isnt?
---
You also get notified of Hunters that have track humanoud active. Even before the Hunter can see you on their minimap
---
ItS a MeTapHoR
---
Better than no xp at all
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10828/dire-nail](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10828/dire-nail)
---
Or a streamer wouldn't advertise themselves on a place like this when there are better forms.
---
Cramming 15k people into a world built for 3k is half-assed. Faction-specific transfers without faction queues are half-assed,
---
How come?
---
Iirc they on shazarah or golemagg.
---
but there is ive used it
---
I healed DM at 17 and lvl 16, it's a little bit slower because the pulls are normally not that big and the cleefe fight can be a little bit stressy but mostly it's fine
---
Doesnt matter when there are atleast 2 full 40 man raids camping searing gorge.
---
It’s not that bad on the two servers I play. Just be careful in really contested zones like hillsbrad
---
Probably being a goblin and flipping the AH.
---
O.5/bait
---
So anyway I photoshppprd some stuff together and threw it up on reddit looking to get me some upvotes
---
I created my first character on Daggerspine back in WotLK. I actually wanted to one day own this :)
---
You're aware this game is 15 years old?
---
My Druid feels this on a spiritual level. 
---
My Paladin is laughing his ass off at priests not having mass dispel.
---
DO YOU EVEN BUBBLE BRO?!
---
It was like this but on a smaller scale. I played on 3 different servers and they all had TM/SS zergs, BRM battles and 5man deathsquads. 
---
Blizzard said that these servers would be a lot bigger so add that up to the fact that people now mostly know how to farm honor and you get exactly this scenario. 
---
People have warned you about this before Classic went live, it just got downvoted a lot by I'm guessing the same people who now claim this isn't pvp.
---
Sucks, I've not had that many terrible experiences with disbands and such but they're not easy to come by, true.
---
Stance counts towards buff limit, amazing how you can be so condescending while also being wrong
---
Isn't Auberdine like 60% Alliance tho?
---
You don't have to play, you know.
---
Dishonourable kill
---
Unless people stand in a place where you can target them by tab-targeting there shouldn't be a way to detect them if they don't cast any spells - unless you've got Detect humanoids/beasts that is, which based on your earlier post we assume no one uses.
---
Yeah. Because a 47 literally isnt worth anything to a 60. But everyone over 47 is. So prepare to get corpsecamped for hours everytime you log on mate
---
Pls tell me this is satire
---
the camp is against the edge of the zone -- i pass it every lap for ore.
---
do not recommend
---
It's all true though.
---
Yeah, I mean that's what I'm doing, but dungeon grinding already isn't great compared to questing (at least not when you're having to pug every run).
---
Now there's the added bonus of 40min to an hour of waiting for people to corpse hop into the instance.
---
Sigh, still some experience is better than NO experience.
---
You can do it backwards too if you jump from up the top down to the window you will be ported. You have to be pretty accurate though the first couple times you try you'll almost certainly end up in the lava.  
---
https://youtu.be/8XkNK3TBg3g?t=241
---
I guess you could try buying from someone in your guild? Talk about it on discord but your not protected if he scams you.
---
It looks like a very factual statement of how the addon works, dude. You are overinterpreting things.
---
You can do Arena runs with one tank and one heal. You don't have to invite other people. Just give the heal all the loot and you get the chest. EZ
---
What you want is your experience back, which wont happen. This is wow classic in 2019,and it comes with more technically adept people, practiced people and strategic people on a mass scale. I hope blizzard let it play out personally
---
You think they want their wow audience to try their new wow expansion? No way!
---
I think they picked the wrong game to play then
---
It’s been four days since this all went live.  It’s going to dissipate over time as the people that are going crazy trying to get kills realize that by PVPing all day long they aren’t getting the ranks or progress they expected.
---
There will still be no lifers going for Rank 14 and such but I think within a week or two we will be back to almost the pre-Phase 2 level of ganking.  Just have to give it a bit of time to slow down.
---
Firemaw is basically unplayable as Alliance atm, i will transfer away when paid transfer is available. 
---
Blizzard can’t fix server imbalance it’s to late for that now!
---
&gt;Were you spending a lot of time fishing and AFKing?
---
Definitely doesn't take that long to hit 60.
---
I use leveling guides and the fastest was my Hunter in 3 days.
---
Can we join from an EU account?
---
BC was the end of WPVP
---
I raid as 5/46. I pvp as 31/0/20.
---
Since it gathers info from combat log I assume its the range of combat log (which is what? 30y?. It might share data between addon users aswell so realistically it could extend the range.
---
/cast Frostbolt
---
And act like a hunter pet on aggressive.
---
We had one use it in brd.
---
I know which is why I’m therapeutically ranting on reddit because nothing will change.
---
It's an elitist/purist mentality, and it's a mentality that used to, and still festers on private servers and hence, classic. You're not a loser anymore (in your own mind at least) if you're part of the elite and the best way to fake being part of the elite is to call everyone casuals and shit on them. They do this to feel good about themselves, probably because they'd feel like shit otherwise.
---
Joined a PvP server looking to shit on other people but I got shitted on and I don’t like it
---
This is the truth. Idk if it's unique to our server or if it's a game-wide problem but 90% of my dungeon runs have been done with a rogue as the tank. Our healer is oom constantly, it sucks. I've been trying to level a warrior to ease the problem but it's still only level 30, meanwhile my main isn't even 60 yet.
---
That would have been fine for me in 2005 but I'm a dad with adult responsibilities. I'm only level 48 on my current server and only have a couple of hours a night to dedicate to gaming.  I don't have the time to relevel from scratch. I would much more likely just move on to another game.
---
&gt;nor are there any efficient number of guards on the docks
---
Blizzard was so sure that the four level 40 Menethil Sentry units would be a sufficient defense against any possible incursion against the continent's only Alliance-friendly port.
---
Lvl 53 warri here ... i love it. I have no advantage at all ... beside a lot of experince dieing
---
Of course... WoW (RPGS as a whole) will never be perfectly balanced. At a certain point your comp will matter, but there were still R1 warriors in S5. There were still Lock's in S2 when you could just equip SR the moment the gates opened. If you're competing purely for R1 then I guess you can complain, but Gladiator was attainable (and was attained) by all sorts of non-meta comps. Class matters a whole lot less than people like to believe.
---
Start blowing their CDs. Naah. I'll just wait 5 seconds then pop perception.
---
Death crawl is a good word for it
---
Uneditedbrut (solemn) alliance paladin. Stabface is the reason I went rogue this time round haha
---
You should be grinding instances for bis any way.
---
&gt; three different ways to reduce threat.
---
What are these? Vanish, feint and ...?
---
Oh sweet, so how much exp did they get? I thought PvP for xp was added in later expansions, didn't realize it was in vanilla //s
---
you have stealth, cry me a river
---
To be honest, the shaman will often be in that position where he's helping everyone do DPS instead of putting out numbers himself. Good that you gave him the time to shine
---
level in a different zone or grind some dungeons, there are enough options
---
Just like runescape, il you go in the wilderness (a free pvp zone that is 30-40 ÷ of the map) and die, you lose a big amount of the equipement you had on you
---
You must be new here.
---
ST is most definitely doable at 50. Just make sure the group is atleast 50. To answer your question, yeah you'll have to level strictlt in dungeons from now on. Or alternatively log on at 4am and see how it is.
---
"Breaking" / "destroying" --&gt; just no.
---
Gnomes Reloaded also helped! :(
---
Next step is breeding alliance in laboratories and aborting alliance fetuses for honor farming.
---
You can do ST dragonfarm runs
---
How fucking sad it is that people of the same faction will steal your skin like that.. literally unheard of back in the day.
---
you are correct, but you can have another battle.net account with a subscription and advertise from that account.
---
realistically most people with multiple subscriptions are multiboxers from retail, grinding the RAF rewards or people who use  /who to track zones of enemy factions players/guilds.
---
So what you are saying is, that pserver players are flat earthers?
---
I really want paid transfers right now, I'm on a PvP server and it is a shit show. Plus being alliance tour out numbered so it's just not fun.
---
My point is that it's harder to get into a group as a rogue than as a healer or tank. Everything else is semantics
---
Yeah, I had a lot of fun in the first month playing mostly with the aim of working up some WPvP. It's an incentive issue. With honour now... its pretty awful to say the least.
---
I mean, if you go to MC with 39 guildies you assemble at Kargath. (if you're horde). I don't see the issue
---
They need to implement battlegrounds.
---
I wouldn't say no one saw it coming. Before classic, on private servers, elitists and purist were definitely a problem too. There's never been any need for gatekeeping. It should be a normal fucking game that everyone can enjoy, but for them it's their last bastion, without which they'll lose their imaginary snowflake status, so they have to protect the idea that it's special and that they are for liking it.
---
git gud
---
If you stealth within 20y of them sure, which you won't.
---
Don't get me wrong, the rogue tank has actually worked out really well most of the time. I like the idea of running with a second healer, we'll give that a shot next time out.
---
My daily playing time has decreased with 80% after phase 2, because I dont want to be corpse camped.
---
I have rolled a hunter on a PVE to play on peak hours as PVP servers for me is unplayable.
---
I'm  critical against Blizzard, but I refuse to believe that they're deciding to not have 1 programmer work 1 day, effectively spending less than $500 to fix this problem.. it's probably more complicated than you make it out to be.
---
Same. It gets annoying / frustrating sometimes but I will always this that over bullshit trash mmos that are made nowadays where nothing organic ever happens.
---
The world and the community feels alive and it's fucking awesome
---
For premades, that will dominate the ladder as it should be. Average PvPer is just a person who stuck in currient progression, but has acquired several raid pieces of gear that allow him to two shot lvls 50-59. The camp quest hubs, kill flight masters and block entrances to local towns, like Everlook in Winterspring. Some even roam Felwood North-East denying furblog rep farm and thus entrance to Winterspring via tunnel. But as a lvl 57 NE druid I just sneaked past furblogs only to find out that I need to wait untill Horde kids stop reskilling local flight master.
---
bye
---
Frost mage, maybe.
---
Aoe is not needed in Mc tho
---
But you can read the combat log FYI lol
---
It wouldn't be so bad if people didnt all go on one server. There is plenty of space but people seem to just care about being in the biggest faction
---
The other day I was making a dungeon group. All my groups specifically say "nothing on res". I had a guy whisper me with the audacity to say he would only join if he could reserve all the greens/unneeded items.
---
This isn't unique either. Almost every time I make a dungeon group with nothing on res, someone asks to join and reserve something.
---
Glad I stopped before phase 2. This seems unfun to the point where it’s kinda desperate.
---
Seems like the biggest problem would be to have soul shards on all of the alts.
---
one guild was camping? oh noes.
---
right now the whole horde population is camping all FP's and dungeon entrances from lvl 50+. even in zones like Wetlands. it takes 6-7 corpse runs to get to any dungeon. it's unplayable. it was nowhere near like that in Vanilla.
---
Sounds like my group heading into UBRS yesterday lol.
---
Allo, Classic Wowhead have a Thottbot theme.
---
ALL JOIN FOR SHADOWLANDS!! IT WILL BE THE BEST GAME EVER!
---
It's funny how Shadowmeld really is probably the best Alliance racial right now if you're still leveling (and aren't already a druid/rogue).
---
I don't know, some dungeon packs or pulls are a lot easier with some form of steady ranged AoE, but I can't think of anything not doable without it. I don't care if I have a mage, warrior or rogue DPS as long as they know their class and do their job.
---
That means pushing the numbers and providing utility and cc when needed, kicking/CSing that dangerous ability and being aware of the situation and surroundings.
---
If a DPS (or any other role) does those things, it's going to be a smooth run - be it a dungeon or raid. And DPS who tick off all those boxes are definitely people you will want to add to Friends and bring to more runs in the future.
---
Mograine? :D
---
42 is a good level to start with ZF. And that stays relevant up until 50 or so, at which point you can go Mara (first run is tricky to get a group for and long, but once you can limit yourself to princess runs it's easier) and at about 51-52 ST becomes possible to take you to 53 and BRD.
---
All high-lvl zones on Bloodfang (which was a low-medium pop server not long ago) are covered in spread-out Horde raids with Spy addon who immediately collapse on any Alliance they find. Back in Vanilla (or on pservers I played) there were not enough players for such coverage.
---
Enjoy your one faction server.
---
I am on Hydraxian Waterlords RP, and we are completely outnumbered by Alliance but guess what? We actually have some fair pvp battles and it has been pretty fun. Feels especially good when you dominate the alliance knowing they're more than you.
---
oooops, sounds like you accidently picked a PvP server, when you shouldve played on a PvE server. 
---
&gt; Still got 3 more weeks until subscription is supposed to renew, so we will see until then if blizzard changed this or not.
---
First time playing a blizzard game? 2020 is more realistic for any changes.
---
Damn right, without the roaming gank squads and PvP raids the people that fight you when you're flagged are going to be other single people or small groups so it doesn't feel unfair.
---
I think this is their best option, really.
---
Who is Ally? Is she a famous streamer?
---
That was actually the point of this post :-)
---
I'm just salty because I still remember Crossroads getting those elites that suddenly would reck unsuspecting people :P
---
And it's fascinating, because it's not that _pvp_ was disabled until now -- just a reward system that most people aren't going to get anything out of. Not for a few HP here and there, not for gear that really isn't better than the tier gear most of those hardcore pvp guilds are already running after having MC on farm since week 2.
---
It's just the 'thing to do' now
---
This is exactly why I finished every quest in STV on my 35-40s I knew that zone would be impossible to quest as an Alliance, because Horde has Zeps from Orgry and Undercity there.
---
You lost on the character creation sceen
---
Is this one of those guides that basically are like if you farm this place for a day for might get an item worth 1k but ot also takes weeks to find a buyer?
---
Well the point of my post is that the quest is called 'Battle of Hilsbrad'.
---
Tldr from my experience:
---
Ele is better at pressing advantage and is weaker on the defensive. It's worse if you get opened on and isn't as good at the long game. Elly is better vs druid and other casters. 
---
Frost is better from behind and better at resetting. Frost is better at the long game of stabilizing and winning vs most melee and especially rogues. 
---
PoM Frost is a nice hybrid. Less defensive in Wpvp but very usable in group PvP as pom sheep is really strong and IB gets less good when you can be focused. 
---
In team PvP I think both are viable. I'd rather have the defensive bonus of impCS/IB or versitility of PoM/Frost if I wanted something aggressive. PoM sheep or bolt pom bolt is really fun.
---
Yeah, I loved the 'rox the library' part the most.
---
&gt; Hey guys! pvp happened on a pvp server!
---
amazing post OP
---
You were right about it being [one shooter](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/b18k24/gunman_opens_fire_at_mosque_in_christchurch_new/eilatk7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Here is an upvote!
---
Lol same. Bunch of fucking whining on this sub all week.
---
Exactly what I told myself. 2 of these bastards are there whenever I have the chance to log on, and both are same faction. Had a silly paladin try to fish there the other day, turns out he had difficulties when it came to mixed land-based and aquatic combat!
---
I think it's fine for servers with a 50-50 population like Razorgore to be honest. Some hours of the day alliance dominate, some Horde dominate and sometimes it's really close 50-50 to see who will win. 
---
But I can imagine it sucks on a server with like 70-30 populations. All you can do is to find a guild or make an alliance if guilds and go together and smash the uncoordinated horde.
---
R14 this time will most likely a streamer priviledge since they have the most time to grind
---
It definitely proves it was a vanilla add on... which I think is his point
---
Rogue/warrior is hard to level. Try killing mobs 1 level higher than you and you'll notice how xp/h rate drops. On the other hand, hunters can capable to solo elites and orange quests. 5 day played time 60 hunter kinda equal to 10 day played 60 warrior/rogue. Unless you have a group to farm.
---
I'm mostly playing my hunter and I just eagle eye to find allies well out of spy range.
---
Each to their own. I'm having a blast on PvP.
---
Plenty people, myself included, are self sufficient while also having enough free time that we can do as we please
---
The Hilsbrad fight has been going on for days now and it goes back and forth between Southshore and Tarren Mill.
---
Spy listens to the COMBAT\_LOG\_EVENT\_UNFILTERED event, and it passes way more information than the standard combat log ingame.
---
And the sky is blue
---
Secret farm spots to the rescue! (or mindless dungeon grinding..)
---
But seriously, it’s nothing compared to vanilla or private server experience. And as classic players are in a vast majority, casual that are not even 60, the pvp system night be here a bit too soon.
---
Imagine a level 50. OP proposes 2 solutions that cannot work:
---
- find another zone to level. Well, Tanaris, felwood, winterspring, plaguelands, seering gorge and burning steppes are a fuckfest. Appart from saying players can bash mobs in the blasted lands, Azshara or the bottom of silithus, I don’t see what we can propose.
---
- go level in instances. Sunken temple (yes even sunken temple...) and BRM is full of gankers. Might be able to run zf and mara. Well good luck with that, level 50.
---
I’m a level 60 druid, so I personally don’t have a real issue appart entering into BRM or trying to save a friend from death... which most of the time turns into me getting getting ganked by 3 rogues or us, killing them. But I can clearly understand why it causes issue to lots of players
---
I love the people who go "hurr durr I think its fine, I can deal with being ganked 2 times on the way to brd". Its not 2 times. It was 2-4 times in p1. Now its 10-12 times and you better pray to fucking God they don't have a priest to mc you back every time you respawn.
---
~~Horde entire flight point locations, abundance of settlements with inns and transportation accessibility~~ Zeppelins are easy mode.
---
Doesn’t seem so. Plenty of others feel the same as me
---
everywhere is a death trap on Mograine. I wonder when the server got so horde heavy, they outnumber us 1.5:1 atm
---
Classic sounds so fun at this point.
---
I never complained about PvP once though. Just pointed out mass PvP  is terrible in WoW, which is true of any two faction MMO.
---
Imagine playing on a PVP server and being so ignorant about the game you don't know that PVP also happens on PVE servers.
---
I won't even try shadowlands, blizz had their chance and ruined it, time after time
---
Sounds like they're having fun, meanwhile you are crying on a website.
---
it's already happening, rogues all over feralas ganking people fishing. Should be honorless kills
---
You dont, rogues are broken and ruin the fun for everyone else
---
Well, even if you legitimately enjoyed world pvp in vanilla, there's a pretty serious unaddressed issue with jamming 3-4x a vanilla server population into the same physical space.
---
You can't avoid pvp. There are no real offpeak hours. Onyxia dies more often than people can turn in head for buff. Etc.
---
This is just the outcome of a very, very stupid decision on blizzards part of being "NO CHANGES!!!1....exceptforsomethinglikepopulationcap"
---
Because the only french realm was full on the first day.
---
I'm sure the horde is having a blast. They outnumber massively on all but a few PvP servers.
---
" Suicide is badass!" - Frank Reynolds
---
Why? I still have it, but have been close to selling it a few times.
---
this guy casts blizzard in hillsbrad foothills
---
I am attempting to trade bandages to rogues, they are not using those either. Sorry man, they just want crisp fresh heals straight out of my Major Mana Potion.
---
Might be easy to say now that I don’t need to level, but enjoying the fight along the way is part of the point. It would be amazing if STV had packs of 35s at each other and some relief 50s rode in to help. This idealistic pvp would be like bgs where people choose to go to the zone and join the fight.The problem is that both sides are guilty of steam rolling solo players repeatedly and sending 60s out where they just ruin the fun.
---
It's more complex than that. They increase the cooldown on all your stuff so that servers have more time to calculate the outcome. Game remain responsive, given your pc can handle view of few thousands of ships nuking it out:

---
Is it viable to do stealth runs while leveling?
---
On my first rogue I waited until 60 then progressed through each wing of SM then ZF and then BRD to get my lockpicking to 300.
---
So my question is if I can attempt to do some SM runs at lower levels. I am 36 right now, pure combat spec, but I am thinking of putting points into sub after getting blade flurry so I can get some pickpocketing going. 
---
With/without sub talents when would SM runs become doable?
---
wow! We got a badass here folks! everyone take note and steer clear! hahaha
---
This might be a difference between EU and US. In EU the honor system was introduced only two months after release, and there were very few level 60s at this time. I can imagine it was different in the US where the game released five months earlier.
---
Hell yeah, it wouldn't be authentic vanilla experience without the constant crying and whining on the forums.
---
Well the Irony is that when BGs release, hordes will complain that BG queue times are out of control....
---
You know people PvP on PvE servers right?
---
It was the first weekend of no layering.
---
Stop spreading misinformation
---
you cant please everybody. this is 15 year old game. blizzard announced how the content was gonna be released long time ago. its not blizzards fault or others players fault that you are not getting your “fair pvp fantasy”. i started classic on horde heavy server where I couldnt quest without getting ganked by multiple players every 5min. guess what i did? i transfered to low population realm. I found solution to the problems i faced.
---
&gt;Pre tell
---
it's "Pray Tell" you fuckin' goofy fuck lmao stop trying to sound smart
---
Are you not going places with guildies?
---
As a warrior you cant beat anything, end of story
---
Thats 4 days too much of this nonsense. The game is literally unplayable for a certain group in this state.
---
It has very low stealth rank and you are immobile, making it easier to find you. It just delays your death if a high lvl enemy has seen you from a distance.
---
Wow rogues hitting 3 buttons and instawinning. What an awesome and balanced game
---
Pretty much! I was surprised with the downvotes but I guess Reddit keyboard knuckleheads went at it again. Pathetic tribalism, like you said
---
Literally didnt type one letter. 
---
You calm down especially.
---
Heartseeker is the only PvP server that I know off where the typical situation (60%+ horde) is reversed. So they just get to play the Alliance experience, there.
---
Where is Zizek
---
/cast !auto shot
---
Yeah, it's entirely possible as long as you stay out of certain areas like hillsbrad.
---
Spam anger /arena. Get sgc and hoj. Do some full runs. Can get ij lbrs at like 57 or so
---
As did I. No point in waiting 2h's to get into a game, followed by spending 80-90% of your ingame time just corpserunning.
---
I think it's pretty close to objective, and would further propose that you are extremely biased because you disagree with it. 
---
For the record, I'm not even using Spy, playing on a PvP realm, so if anything that should make me as close to objective as possible, no?
---
Mostly been moving around in a group of 3-5 people though, except when riding into BRM for MC when we went full raid.
---
I never understood the hateboner this sub has about BiS lists. What are you supposed to do if not look up what items you need? Aimlessly wonder around dungeons and getting items randomly?
---
Use line breaks you fucking mongrel
---
&gt;all you're doing is gathering stuff and we're enjoying lvl 60 wpvp
---
WPVP happens on PVE servers too... Every single day there are city raids and hillsbrad battles on my server...
---
All these fucking ignorant kids lmfao...
---
I use the following:
---
`#showtooltip Hunter's Mark`  
---
`/cleartarget [dead]`  
---
`/targetenemy [noharm]`  
---
`/cast !Auto Shot`  
---
`/cast [mod:ctrl] Hunter's Mark`
---
Could everyone please stop with this Blizzard sticking to #nochanges nonsense? 10k pop servers is worlds away from the vanilla experience.
---
Blizzard should either release more servers and lower the pop cap to what was meant to be (and more or less worked just fine) or try to remedy THAT one big change they made with other changes.
---
You need another account with a NA subscribtion.
---
I don't get how people need this long to get into BRD.. I'm playing Alliance on Venoxis, so we are quite heavily outnumbered. I am always going into BRM from the south, so at the moment im landing at Morgan's Vigil, dying at least 10 seconds later. Rez at savest spot - mount - run to BRM (most of the time die 1 more time on the way). South entry has been save most of the time, but if not die one more time, and then I will most of the time get until BRD portal - die the last time and you are there :D That's maybe 15-20 minutes if it's bad.. but there were times this weekend where I even got there with only 2 deaths from Morgan's Vigil in the instance.
---
The mob of casual players thought they wanted to be on a pvp server but they actually don't. If they knew what they wanted they would of rolled on a pve server, but they don't actually know what is good for them.
---
Listening to casual players is one of the most sure-fire ways to ruin a game.
---
This is coming from someone who is on a pve server, and p2 has been the most fun I've had in this game yet.
---
It definitely will. Once people have been ganking all week for the entire first week and realize it barely got them to rank 3, they'll calm down their High Warlord dreams. For the most part, anyway.
---
 cuius epistulae titulus otiosi
---
Don’t play Blizzard
---
It’s just part of the experience and I think you’re underestimating the average player’s tolerance. Friends and I are casual players, we got ganked as lowbies leveling up. It sucked but it was a given. It’s not like we hate the game or the players. And now we gank others indiscriminately just as was done to us.  And eventually those guys will do the same, as the game was intended. Thus is the cycle of life.
---
its just butthurt alliance players mad they picked the wrong faction.
---
&gt;but I gotta say the Alliance here are REALLY starting to put up a serious fight
---
I heard someone say that the horde just has numbers and the skilled players are on Alliance and I thought it was a meme. 
---
The showing at Kazzak was pitiful, and then we were laying out some serious horde until every guild came out of org to try to steal azuregos from their fellow horde
---
Did you do leveling after p2 release? Because before I agree that people of the same level never ganked you. But now they attack on sight more than 50% of the time.
---
Hydraxian Waterlords is much better ;) Very nice community at Horde side!
---
SPY isnt a class ability. Moron
---
Savage.
---
totally disagree, on my server, there has been constant battles in southshore, 100+ in each side. EPic battles....with the tide swaying both ways round the tower.... going on for hours each day. 
---
Seems to be a lot of folk loving it.
---
What is the Problem with that as Long as the game is still fun?
---
I'm still having a blast so I really don't give two fucks about all that.
---
Raids are still easy but will become more difficult. Not saying they will be Heroic/Mythical Raid difficulty but they do get more difficult.
---
If you can't cope with the PVP System then go back to retail xD
---
I played this forever and still love it. If you can't understand that then sorry. But well. Not my Problem :D
---
You can hope for classic+ in 2-3 years. I really wish you best of luck
---
I've had more fun than them by doing other things than investing a massive amount of time to do boring raids and meaningless PvP. Sorry dude, the mass PvP sucks and I was right about it before the game even came out. If you spent those 10+ days /played exercising you would have improved your life drastically from where you are stuck at right now.

But you arent worth honor after zone changes on zep
---
they should ban this addon, immediately
---
TIL invisibility pot removes stuns, bleeds and dots in addition to being available to use in combat and has no cooldown.
---
Are you always this stupid or just pretending to be?
---
Friends and guild comming to the rescue does nothing since there's another opposing faction party/raid around the corner and despite how easy you make it sound nobody plays this game to be a level 55s bodyguard.
---
I’m just playing the auction house and being like this in sw all day lol
---
So basically the PvP rewards are really good. They take a long time to get but they're comparable or better than items you can get in the current raids (with respect to PvP and pve). 
---
Previously there was no reason to PvP other than for the fun of it or to stop someone from taking a resource from you. Now that there's a reason more people will be pvping. 
---
It makes it harder to quest to high levels. It's in general harder to find a low/mid level dungeon group now than it was while the majority of players were leveling. So in a sense it's harder to level and harder to catch up.
---
Questing isn't such a smart idea if you have nowhere to turn the quests in...
---
The longer you postpone the inevitable the worse it's going to get, servers NEVER balance out. It only gets worse 99% of time.
---
You should of xfered off or rerolled eariler. The next best thing you can do is swap servers now, instead of continuing to wait.
---
Since classic is based of 1.12 they are also going ahead of X-realm BG's (which I wasn't originally a fan of but considering my servers faction balance is needed to ever enter a BG for me).  So if they match up PvE and PvP servers it will not be too unbalanced although if Horde prefer to pvp more than alliance there may still be a slight queue time.  I believe if you include both pve/pvp servers the overall faction balance is very close to 50/50.
---
Yes you can - people have already make WeakAura functional clones of spy.
---
I did DM lashers from 52-60 on my gnome mage.
---
Unless you're leveling. Which is impossible atm
---
You barely use eviscerate as dagger in raids.
---
It is good way to get money while gearing up. 
---
After that the best ways imo are DME jump runs, farming good spots in early mornings when they are empty or making money from professions.
---
All Gnome Mages I interacted with before and after Phase 2 were cunts.
---
Because it's badass.
---
But actually it's part of an uncompleted quest chain in winterspring, so if you ever do get tired and want to be rid of it, go turn it in. You'll get more gold that way
---
Don't do World PVP then xD
---
And if you do - don't do it in fcking raids. Everyone know it give shitty honor anyway. Run around in a 3-5 stack and blow People up. That way you actually get some honor...
---
Basing the whole game on one aspect (mass world pvp) is really a bad Review :3
---
40-60 (my server Mograine EU) is bad enough, that means the majority faction has 50% more players than the minority faction. I shudder to think how it is on servers with even worse ratio than that.
---
They are bad and it makes them feel good.
---
Rolling Alliance on a PvP server was the first mistake. You're virtually guaranteed to be massively outnumbered.
---
Expect the game to stay like this until battlegrounds hit.
---
You should have rolled pve server bro.
---
Stop whining, I got camped at flight path 15 years ago, I am getting camped right now.
---
I knew exactly what I was signing for when opened a character at a pvp server, you obviously didn’t and you want blizzard to fix YOUR mistake.
---
God I hope they will stick to their schedule.
---
No they are all crazy and actually hate what they are doing. There is a dark force making them do it! They Need help because the game sucks and everyone knows that beside those pesty #nochangers
---
are you horde or alliance? 
---
What you need to do is finds spots which are not regularly visited by either faction, and just go grind for a while.  
---
For Alliance, head to The blasted lands, and grind there. There is no horde FP, so apart from the repeatable quests for buffs, horde dont tend to venture into there too much. 
---
For Horde, head to Azshara and go to the cliffs in the deep south. Again not many quests here, so easy to grind away on your own.
---
You should be happy that your bis is such an easy item to get and yet you complain abt it? I havent even seen a single perditions blade, nor a viskag. Only downside is that your threat output is determined by that staff, but shouldnt really be an issue since any min/maxer wouldnt be playing a tank druid in the first place.
---
PvP still exists on PvE servers. It just means we can turn it off so we can actually play the rest of the game/level alts instead of spending 3 hours a day as a ghost
---
Good to know I honestly had no idea they were planning on doing x realm bgs but since they are than I can definitely see that fixing the issue for alot of the allie players.
---
3Head post
---
one of the first quest lines as undead is to steal farmers pumkins. Then they send you back to murder the farmers and after send you there again to kill the guards. I felt bad doing this quest.
---
Imagine disparaging people for not playing a video game as much as you.
---
There is a difference between experiencing PVP and being unable to play at all.
---
Honestly either dominant faction is going to funnel resources to the other side or you just have to wait for the timer for automatic opening (it happened on lower pop vanilla servers).
---
It's the same on both sides, I assure you.
---
I don't know if it's practical, but there are quest mobs close to the Dark Portal who become immune and do nothing when low-life
---
The version of classic we are playing is loaded with changes though
---
&gt;posted on 01-01-2006
---
fair enough
---
&gt;was instantly detected by spy addon
---
if you didn't use any abillities you don't show up in their combat log so spy can't detect you
---
vanish doesn't show up in the log either so you could've vanished without being spotted
---
&gt; mage and priest killed me after I started fighting the solo warrior that I thought was the only competition I had 
---
so you're a rogue in stealth picking a target and you don't take 5 secs to check your surroundings?
---
I'm not into video editing at all but can't stop thinking of a new meme for this topic:   
---
Dr. Strange scene from Infinity War where he seeing future possibilities, overhead label BFA Alliance player  
---
After he finish all other asking, which server they should create their characters for classic. Finger up, answer: PVE
---
ok boomer.
---
All 50-60 Zones are camped to shit. Getting into BRD takes well over an hour with 15 corpseruns just to get there.
---
I disagree here, if you're preemptively mad at a company and don't trust them to do anything right, paying them anyway for their product doesn't give you any more right to criticize when ultimately it goes wrong (in your opinion). It just makes you a cry baby, cos you knew EXACTLY how this was going to go.
---
My 60 pallid was killed 5 times between Morgan's vigil and BRzf on Herod.
---
So?
---
You can barely see that far anyways.
---
You want the Combat Log to have information your Player Character can’t see?
---
20yd. Ahahahhahahaah
---
The combat log registers at well over 80 yards. Otherwise it wouldnt register ranged attacks
---
blind is 10sec in both pve and pvp
---
Speaking as alliance, sounds like heaven to me. Where can I find this beautiful place?
---
Have they gone up again? For a while they were at about 18.5
---
&gt; arms warrior
---
ftfy
---
Did the Same. But I fear that it will Not be much Better with BGs on a 30/70 Server as Alliance.
---
you seem to have misunderstood the OP entirely then.  Hes saying they're trying to sabotage the game so they can say "TOLD YA SO" you're saying they didn't expect the game to do well.  you're arguing with no one, go away now
---
Dying
---
Same. 54 Paly. Tried to get to BRD for 1h, gave Up.
---
Rip trying to level a human
---
I completely agree, but track humanoids does the same thing, in essence.
---
what gear are you wearing?
---
I feel like corpse camping is not THAT bad on german server maybe... I dunno.. I can always escape at least on the 2nd try
---
It really isnt. Because quests give gold and items needed to play. Like anyone is gonna take a Tank to DM rolling up in level 40 gear.
---
So it is Blizzards fault I see.
---
You should try questing when classic came out if you werent infront of the main wavefront.... GOD THAT WAS A SNAIL'S PACE!!!
---
cant pop it from the bank
---
Me in SW a level 33 rogue after p2 release.
---
Easy fix. More servers at lauch. And of they "die" merge them. 
---
There. I fixed the issue
---
On my server we make fun of these "DaLrENd rEsErVEd or HoJ ReS" etc.. groups especially if its made by rogs. When a tank reserve orbs thats a different thing because thats their only chance to get money so I have no problem with those.
---
Wrong because he never fully gained the 100hp in the first place after using the enchant. It made no difference to the fight in the end.
---
He anticipated world PvP would massively change how PvP realms would be played and picked a class that functions well in that climate! HE SUCKS!
---
Its massive burst. Good for pvp
---
Just so you know, while tank is very fun to easily find group for 5 man dugeon. With a warior you'll be 
---
*Almost useless in pvp, get shit on pretty much everyone 1v1, good with a healbot (kind of)
---
*Not good at farming things, you can't cc, drop aggro etc ... (maybe 2 man instance)
---
*You'll have a very hard time finding raid as a tank since you don't need much tank in raid
---
*If you plan to go dps then you'll have to equip yourself with leather and other item usuallay not intended for you class
---
But yeah you'll have an easier time finding dugeon groups, that's nice for leveling
---
I actually started timing both entrances, /u/SheogorathTheSane observations are right:
---
Thorium (SG) -&gt; BRD: 7 deaths, avg corpserun time 3:42 = 26 minutes
---
Morgans (BS) -&gt; BRD: 12 death, avg corpserun 4:22 = 52 minutes (including Thorium switch after you get in)
---
"Oh hi! First time here? No? Well you should totally see this Jaina cinematic from a raid that's over a year old!"
---
"Oh you refreshed, okay how about this cinematic of Rastakhan binding his family to bob sandy!"
---
"Hmm? Other cinematics? The rest don't matter, watch these 2, forever."
---
Assuming it's about general endgame pve:
---
The point is that it's an instant cast that does decent damage. Locks don't have any of those, outside of nightfall procs. It's a good spell to use as an "execute", since it gives you a shard back if the mob dies within the next 5 seconds. You should not lose a shard if you use it that way. Just keep like 3-5 shards in your bags (collected with drain soul) because shadowburn can get resisted. There's no other talent that will give you something as useful as shadowburn.
---
A more advanced way of using shadowburn is to consume improved shadow bolt procs on the target.
---
Love these types of interactions. Cute, wholesome and fun
---
Im not replying to the OP you nimrod. Im replying to the guy saying OP was wrong.
---
RMP with vanilla Polymorph would be ridiculous.
---
I didn't read your dumbass rant because it's been said before. The fact of the matter is that you are too lazy and unmotivated to form your own group. If a guy wants to go through the trouble of forming some very specific group and everybody joining him is cool with it, then who are you to bitch?  
---
Also, does no one fucking realize that these groups are generally beneficial to all those involved?
---
F for that poor young Tauren.
---
Classic is already ruined if they don't make this game playable again.
---
Was in Winterspring yesterday. Can't do anything, literally dying wherever I go (including getting camped INSIDE Everlook, even buildings). This game isn't about getting farmed 24/7 and literally not being able to do anything except standing in Stormwind.
---
Yes, that amplifies the stupidity of the nochangers even more.
---
it sure does. 
---
Maybe if you stopped roleplaying as a doomsayer on the forums and actually logged in to play.
---
no, you can still have a great time on both pve and pvp servers, but if you want to have a safe level experience without getting griefed by enemy faction player then start on a pve realm.
---
if its your first time playing wow then you will have a lot to explore and learn. try to find a social guild and if you dont know how to proceed with a quest then google its name.
---
Hadn't you heard?
---
Addblock my friend...
---
This post is getting a lot of attention by pro-pvpers, the other 3 or 4 posts are all whining that PvP is ruining the game. Honestly there is an easy solution if you hate WPvP - re-roll PvE server.
---
\#nOChANg0s plz!
---
1. if you play alliance, wait it out and just raid-log until p3 (or p2.5 with bgs), dont even give the horde any satisfaction of that 3:1 owpvp.
---
2. get instant bg queues 24/7 while the average horde player will be lucky to get 1 bg popping up in an entire evening.
---
3. Reach AV exalted 3x faster than horde.
---
4. Browse through reddit and enjoy the countless whines and complaints of horde players about bg queue times and moo unfair!
---
It will only be a few weeks max until we get bg's, in every further phase after that Alliance will have 10x more fun and progress easier in all aspects of the game, but you do you, enjoy being big green and ugly while you can.
---
i bet Thrall is not happy with that hawkish behaviour ;)
---
Another thread full of angry alliance. The tears are so good mmmm
---
&gt; EDIT: also i need another macro... when i not have aspect of cheetah it  shall turn on aspect of cheetah.. but when it is already on it shall  switch to aspect of monkey 
---
I double this, It would also be great for altering tracking abilities with one button.
---
Hey man, if you hate it so much why don't you re-roll a PvE server?
---
Yes they were.
---
The biggest issue is that for some reason people go out of their way to be an asshole now. I don't really know why, there's just tons of behavior that can't be explained by fun or honor farming. Like the camping of flight paths, people don't give honor when they land but you're still killed, and then corpsecamped way beyond the point where you give honor.
---
Like 15 man raid groups are chasing one guy across several zones and then corpsecamped him, I don't get it. It's not for honor and I don't see how it's any fun either.
---
Even if you’re grouped it’s a shitshow. Horde camp Thorium Point constantly.
---
Alliance raids Kargath pretty constantly too, but they leave TP vulnerable because they get more honor at Kargath. Pretty annoying.
---
The dark forces are known as "buyers remorse" and "sunk cost fallacy"
---
"Well, I've already played this boring game for this long, PvP HAS to be good to salvage my time investment!"
---
You can't farm without pvping in classic. 
---
Not doing your daily quests is just wasted gold, simply saying "Don't do them" isn't a solution to a glaring problem. 
---
I don't know what you mean by continents being trivialized, I'm always all over the map in classic doing something, whether it be farming, pvping, or dungeons and raids. 
---
Travel time matters, rather than having 280%-310% speed + z-axis, I have 103% or something in x-axis. It's a big difference.
---
Arenas are hilariously balanced, do you know how many Rogues and Mages you'll have to fight on a daily basis if you actually wanted to arena? Holy fuck I'd want to quit. Not saying they're unbeatable, but an absolutely monotonous and painful matchup simply because they're best.
---
As a rogue I noticed a pattern: If you try to flee without interaction you are almost certainly dead. But if you Blind or at least Gouge the attacker you can get away 9 times of 10 if he is alone.
---
Scatter shot and freezing trap share a DR. It was added in 1.12 so it's authentic, it was only around for a few patches though and should be removed.
---
Ehh, I mean they decreased the amount of time required to get a dungeon group, but they also made questing/grinding a nightmare with people camping individual mob spawns. The commodities market is a fucking mess, especially now that layering is gone.
---
I would argue that on the whole, the increased population has been bad for player experience.
---
I'm glad you enjoy helping others and building a positive community atmosphere..... But.... Why u gotta flex gear like dat?
---
You should have knew what to expect when rolling on a PvP server, or is PvP only fun when you are winning? In which case. Re-roll a PvE server, you rolled PvP for the wrong reasons
---
Ganked at pvp server...
---
People entered classic pvp servers thinking its kindergarten.
---
Kuroma checking in.
---
Yeah, I guess my nearly constant subscription since vanilla, 50k+ HKs on my Vanilla druid, and other bullshit are just me playing this game out of spite for myself, lmao.

Unbuffed 4,7k hp with fullt1 op weapons and shit and the first if just half mentally challenged lvl50+ mage or rog who run into you, can kill you easily cuz balance, warrior life. Nah jk atleast our mortal strike hit hard if the enemy lagg out and we can reach the finally.
---
Of course there is, because those are not on the same scale.
---
You can play as much as you like but since it is a pvp server you may not be able to do what you planned to do. That is part of the pvp experience. Everybody knows you can't tell the other faction how little they should attack you.
---
&gt; the repair bill (higher for being plate AND because you're always taking damage and dying)
---
Only partly true (in regards to plate), since there are also Druid tanks out there :)
---
&gt; the constant trash tank 
---
If you are putting up with constant trash talk for pugs, then lay down some ground rules beforehand. I.e. "It's my way or the highway". Most people will shut up if the tank tries to lay down the law. If they won't, you are likely better off without them. 
---
&gt;  the dps constantly attacking shit before you use any abilities and screwing up the pull 
---
Educate them. Give them a couple of chances where you tell them. If they continue to do it, remove them from the group (or at least threaten it). 
---
&gt; and causing wipes that you get blamed for etc etc.
---
I'd explain myself calmly. If they won't listen, I would either request the problem(s) leave or I'm leaving myself.
---
Are you using clipped or full rotation?
---
as a healer, i can confirm. i am just chilling as long as the dps gives the tank some space and dont insta ejaculate over the trashpacks.
---
Absolutely not
---
It was already a problem during beta ( about 70-30 horde ) and Blizzard made it worse on release.
---
Not only they opened too much servers to counter the huge queues, but they also came up with this weird policy against data gathering APIs. So most of the playerbase spread randomly across dead servers with no reliable informations about population or faction balance. 
---
The best we can hope now is a vast free transfers + merge campaign.
---
I like how people such as you tell people to re-roll like it's so trivial. I don't need you to tell me what to do. Bye.
---
That's basically what I'm doing. I'm fine doing it with guildies though.
---
The two drops I've seen were both lost to guild rogues, so not all tragedy.
---
Why even keep it? As a paladin, you get Light of Elune every 5 minutes.
---
Your points make literally zero sense. It doesn't waste people's time. In fact, it generally saves everyone involved a ton of time in the long run. It doesn't encourage selfish or unrealistic behavior at all. It encourages intelligent cooperation and patience with the reward being a free roll on the item you're after. Hate to say it, but go back to retail if this is your attitude. Nothing you are saying makes any logical sense. You're just crying.
---
Hello, you guys still looking for more members? I’m a low level ally hunter but thinking about switching realms. Hoe active is your realm for lower levels?
---
Depends if you have a stable group to play with.
---
&gt; There is no directional indication of where they are, no coordinates other than the ones that show where you were when they were spotted, nothing other than the ability to target them.
---
First of all, being able to target people behind physical obstacles if they aren't in your group is something that is not possible without the addon, outside of /tar and typing the name (that you can't see behind obstacles!).
---
Second: Spy lists players that in stealth. That alone breaks rogues and ferals. I am guilty of this as well, as I used spy since a few weeks to make me aware if someone is approaching stealthed. Never got jumped out of stealth since then. While it did save my ass, it's not right to gimp 2 classes in that way.
---
Way too many mages and priest. Not enough tanks. I don’t blame them though. Lvling a tank sucks!
---
&gt; Stop telling people the same shit you condemned Ion for.
---
It was actually J. Allen Brack who said the famous like and he is wayyyy above Ion's paygrade now that he's inherited the big red blizzard button
---
You're wrong.
---
It will go on until bg are live.
---
Oh really? Good to know haha
---
I see all these treads and I can relate because alliance on Grobbulus are more aggressive than Horde
---
Wouldn't change a thing. I was kinda missing the thrill of PvP before phase 2 hit. Everyone just walked past everyone because there was no point in attacking.
---
Its litetally a cheat. Its just called addon. Makes it easier to use.
---
If you don't like the rules, don't pay. Shoo.
---
There's a reason PvE servers were "Normal" servers in vanilla.
---
Thanks, friend.
---
I can guarantee everyone defending the server pops and phase didn't EVER play vanilla.
---
Hi, /u/7thfallen
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dy0x0v/curious_why_did_you_join_your_guild/). 
---
since i am a healer and have healed everything from 1-60 without any problems despite it being my first time playing classic, i wonder, what is from your point of view the difference between a good and a bad healer?
---
maybe i have some bad habits that i am unaware of.
---
That's not a thing. Macro's can't track buffs and then perform commands based on that information.
---
Our server is looking pretty good. I am working on a lvl 20ish atm and see people all over while questing. And you’re more than welcome to join too :)
---
I don't think that merging servers is simple either. Ton of forced name changes, even greater faction imbalance (servers with Alliance majority are rare), AH price upset, etc.
---
Rogue in my guild has the two best in slot raid daggers among other raid gear. When we pvp together he sometimes kills people before I can even get a 1.5 second cast off. Weapons are huge for a rogue.
---
&gt; People back then asked for a group finder, and rightfully so. Nobody asked for the dungeon streamliner we actually got in Wrath (it doesn't even allow you to choose what group you want to join or leave an undesirable group, that's literally the entire point of a group finder).
---
This. The Dungeon Finder would be amazing in classic, IF &amp; ONLY IF it's the "Premade Finder" in retail that people use for getting M+ dungeons and instead of showing "Tank, Healer, DPS" logo's, it shows the spec icon for whatever class, so if you get a Boomkin DPS it will show the boomkin icon
---
&gt; Spy was around in vanilla
---
That is not the issue. Classic is not vanilla. Saying stuff was availble in vanilla as an argument that it should be in classic is pointless. Discord wasn't around when vanilla rolled around, but no one objects to it's use now.
---
Several posts already explaining it and this posts seems like a way for you to brag. Anyway, I will try to resume it to you.
---
This is not pvp and you clearly play on a server less populated or where your faction is the larger one, probably horde. This is plain right a steamroll of griefing. Imagine getting killed in every small town, every small flight master, ever run to the dungeon.... you are permanently dead and always vs 5+. 
---
People are not complaining about pvp, they are complaing about being steamrolled by sheer numbers on a world too small for the huge server size that blizzard released.
---
I've just moved to a lower populated server, also pvp and I'm very happy now. I still get killed in the flight master and ganked while farming but now it's fair fights where we can fight back and win. Now it's fun.
---
There, I just resumed the previous posts for you that you didn't bother to read.
---
&gt; the blue pvp set is garbage for most compared to tier 1 
---
The blueset is actually kinda good for some classes, especially in comparison to T1. But I agree, most people are just getting the trinket
---
No, its being truthful about the situation that he just described.
---
You need to learn how to converse with human beings instead of just throwing around insults, makes you look like an idiot.
---
0 int warrior right there
---
Everything you just said is hilariously projection within projection. You live in a fantasy world where this is representative of actual vanilla in any capacity. I’m going to report you for being an assclown. I hope the mods and admins nuke you. Don’t bother replying. You’re already blocked, kiddo.
---
My friend wanted us to roll on a PvP server, which we did, but this asshole is an altaholic so we can't even play together...
---
Wish I was lucky to have party members like you. Im a warrior and had Ardent Custodian drop in Ulda and lost the roll between myself a holy priest and ret paladin. I then ran Maraudon later and had Kang the Decapitator drop and lost it to a mage lol
---
While that's actually sound advice, the reality is that people just won't come back. The people quitting now are gone for good.
---
depends what you mean by reliable... Toxic horrors have been on farm since our server has been using up a lot of the essence... so not a lot of farming to go around. Frankly we just have been runing strath live over and over to get orbs to sell on the AH
---
On Fairbanks, theres a zerg in hillsbrad, menethil/dustwallow, searing gorge, burning steppes, ungoro, and occasionally arathi (alongside the other aforementioned.) This doesn't even account for the 5-10 man gank squads that roll through pretty much every contested zone across Azeroth.
---
that is the mentality that got us retail you know, dungeon finder, LFR, etc. etc.
---
if I pay I must be able to ___
---
if you really want, you can reroll on pve or on a server where your side dominates if you wanted.
---
&gt; You re bad because skill is relative and those players who are 60 and geared would beat you in every metric
---
I killed many raid geared lvl 60 players before I reached lvl 60 myself (as I was taking it slow and waiting for some friends), even mirror matchups. Just because someone is geared and level 60 doesn't mean they are any good at the game (let alone PvP). There are plenty of raiders out there that don't know anything about PvP for example.
---
People don't do that it's not efficient
---
100% true. I was in a pvp guild that ran premades. We had multiple r14 and r12-13. We shared usefull pvp addons, noone ever mentioned anything similar to spy.
---
I leveled as arms up untill 45. Switched to fury. You dont need to be prot specced to tank dungeons until you hit 58.
---
15 comercials and 20sponsors in the video and 5 minutes of actual content explaining the same thing 3 times before cutting to the plot
---
I've had Ardent Custodian, Kang the Decapitator and a Libram of Constitution which sells for 80-90g on my realm all drop
---
&gt; I don't have the time to relevel from scratch. I would much more likely just move on to another game.
---
That makes no sense, you do have the time it's just you don't see value in levelling again. Classic is going to be at minimum a 2 year project, it's taken you 2.5 months to hit 48, so lets say 60 would take 3.5 months. If you started from scratch on a new realm you'd hit 60 before BWL dropped and probably just walk into MC and be handed every bit of loot that drops since most people already have it ready for BWL, you can then enjoy 18 months of Classic on a decent realm
---
Fuck you nigger bitch foot stamp lover
---
That's not cooldown, it's current CC duration.
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
That would be 1 mob every twenty seconds... is that possible without any downtime? Idk. You’re also going to need a bunch of 20 slot shard bags which arent free. 
---
I’m not saying it’s bad income just that the soul shard farming is something people are vastly over looking.
---
I'm so steamed it took me a whole 4 hours to calm down enough to type this out. 1v1 me Runescape.
---
&gt; I hope people will realize this week that they got barely any honor and ranks and stop doing this shit. 
---
Yeah you still get the same amount of ranking even if you get dogshit honor compared to BGs since everybody is getting dogshit honor and ranking is not based on amount of honor you get, but amount of honor you get compared to the rest of your faction on your realm.
---
You should just shut your bitch face
---
Yeah? I'm on a subreddit for classic WoW, what do you expect?
---
/cast battle stance
---
/cast charge 
---
/cast hamstring 
---
You cant charge in hamstring range and cant hamstring at charge range 
---
I have intercept on a separate macro 
---
#showtooltip intercept 
---
/cast berserker stance 
---
/vast interxept
---
wops , why should you keep this? deleted mine yesterday
---
Done it 3 times already in Classic! 👍🏼
---
&gt; **Remember: No addon will magically make you good at this game. Be the change you want to see in the game.** 
---
Without a spy addon I will be killed by a rogue from 100% to 0% (3.8k hp) with zero control of my character. With a spy addon I can pre-emptively switch to cat form and stand a fighting chance of not instantly losing. These addons address a very unbalanced aspect of vanilla PVP. Why would I uninstall it?
---
Actually we do pvp. Hillsbrad is the designated location right now for wpvp. In addition, theres discord for the server, for both horde and alliance, where we can arrange massive world pvp fights and in addition, we raid cities.
---
We can do everything you do but decide when we want too.
---
Jokes on them. It's two inches not three.
---
Lal
---
I tend to run arena+golemlord+angerforge - means there's something for everyone and you doing get locked out!
---
Kinda sad if you picked a class that is solely based on a rather (hopefully very) short, time-limited part of the game.
---
Nice!
---
What addon shows the dots over target?
---
Real sticky glue.
---
Getting instakilled and corpsecamped by 5+ lvl 60s as soon as you land on the FP on your level 50 trying to quest isnt PvP, its pure fucking aids.
---
Totally agree but neckbreads will probably be triggered!
---
Steam hams and break hearts.
---
That would be a terrible mistake. Rolling a PVE server now just because there's a lot of ganking and thereby closing all opportunities of fun encounters with the enemy faction in the open world for all future.
---
Depends on the person i guess, but that sounds way less fun to me. I'd rather corpse run 10 times for the opportunity of 1 great interaction compared to not ever having the opportunity at all.
---
That's not an argument. Guess that's why you were downvoted like that.
---
It actually does more than that. Its using the combat log to record mana regen, energy regen, rage decay, normal HP reg. Basically you cant do anything to be invisible to it.
---
I agree with this. I finally downloaded it today after pvping without it for the last few days and dear god what a difference. I had no idea it would work so well against stealthed targets. I think this falls under the same category as the LFG addon (which also did technically exist in classic) as incompatible with the spirit of classic, to use blizz's words.
---
They should have faction locked free transfers to the majority faction, or setup different free transfers for each faction
---
E.g
---
Horde Flamelash &gt; (Realm with Low Horde Pop)
---
Alliance (High Pop) &gt; Flamelash
---
Yeah. But the story in 1 expansion takes like 24 hours /played to finish. So you'll habe a character ready for shadowlands in like 3 days. Thats nothing like classic
---
Was gonna go brd with a spellcleave last night. Two mages were super far away so i told them to start going before we were full FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.  
---
Both were like ”nah got HS in karg” 
---
Spent the next 20-30min after the HS getting from karg to the enterance. 
---
Kinda my fault for rerolling from sham to preist 1 day before honor opened :):):)
---
I thought that was so strange! The innkeeper there is the only one I have seen without the "let me browse your goods" option.
---
Exactly why I rolled NE first lol
---
They aren't crybabies they are just scum (mostly).
---
I can smell an ancient meme, but I can't quite put my finger on it.
---
I guess classic Multiboxing is working the same as Retail. Dont know if there a couple of options but i only knew the one where u have a programm that gives the KeyCombos to ur multibox accounts, so u have 3 x world of warcraft open and have some macros on ur Mainchar like "cast Firebolt 1,2 cast Frostbolt 3"  and then 2 of ur mages will use fire bolt and 1 will use frostbolt
---
I actually feel it was worse before Phase2 . The release day of phase 2 was hectic, but it has quieted down a bit.
---
Before Phase 2, most people who wanted to kill the opposite faction were camping dungeon entrances. Now it feels like they spread out more.
---
Even if you hit 60, it's a bad time
---
"You think you do, but you don't" rings true here
---
Wonderful, you can get to your dungeons sometimes and quests always.  Alliance can't do either ever.  There's like a short window of time when an alliance raid rolls in until the darkness returns.
---
All the complaining right now is just affirming how I made the right choice to go PvE this time around (because all complaints I've been reading are the same complaints I had back in Vanilla)
---
Could someone do this for EU? Thanks in advance
---
Do you seriously believe you can't do BGs on a PvE server?
---
from the state of this subreddit, i think some who hit lvl 60 are also having an awful time
---
classic+ would probly be a good thing at this point since the servers are so big already.
---
I have a short question about being stealthed. When I stealth before anyone is in spy range, will my stealth "buff" be recognized by spy, or am I save til I do something?
---
SC2 is a great example actually.  It's very fun to play and learn because there's so much information, but the game has nearly been perfected down to the finest detail by the top players so winning and losing comes down to tiny mistakes really - rather than some kind of a "narrative" eg one player falling behind early on and making a heroic come-back
---
I love playing on a PvP server, and always have. The added thrill that, aside the mobs and quests you are doing, a battle of skill and wits with another player might be just around the corner is an awesome thing to have, the sense of danger, sometimes not being able to farm that spot because you'll be killed for being there. It's fun to me.
---
That is pretty much none of what I'm experiencing now. I'm obviously in a fairly shit spot, being lvl 57 when honor got introduced, but exactly nothing I love about PvP is transpiring in the current incarnation. I walk around questing, taking care not to get too low so I can fight off any surprise attackers, or possibly run if they're higher than me. Que groups of 5+ well geared 60 steamrolling over me, and repeat ganking whenever i resurrect or cross paths again. And this is going on \*everywhere\*. Landing in an area? Get stomped. Travelling by boat? Ganked, ganked, ganked. Moving to a dungeon? 5-6 corpseruns minimum. Instead of PvP being an added aspect to a versatile game, it's the only thing that's going on, and in a way that disallows anything but joining a raid and hopping along for similar washing away of solo-opponents and the occasional clash between groups.
---
Again, PvP, including World-PvP is one of the things I enjoy most about WoW. The form it has currently taking, I deeply hate.
---
Man you got issues...
---
that was why i made the post though, because i installed it on saturday and was like "woah this is fucking useful".  I've found a bunch of horde that I otherwise would have missed, especially rogues
---
I can never get my spells off against rogues or warriors... And warriors got enough life to survive my 3minute fuck you boom.
---
Only if you're trash though
---
Otherwise you just pocket some honor and move on. Or do a getaway with a stealth device and a 100% mount with mithril spurs and a carrot.
---
Although it must be said, open world when you don't have a 100% mount is going to hurt.
---
No vulgar, obscene, inappropriate, offensive, or any other similarly NSFW material.
---
This includes, but is not limited to: Sexism, homophobic comments, racial slurs, harassment, or otherwise offensive material.
---
So wait you’re telling me there’s a healthy  balanced pvp community on your server where in the WORLD of Warcraft both factions  are controlling different points of the world and you still find a reason to complain about it??
---
Windseeker has been nothing but good clean fun and I’m loving it. Rolling a PvE server was the best thing I ever did. Y’all can keep that “corpse camped at BRM” shit on Herod and Faerlina
---
Not saying you're wrong and your argument is now ruined but.... You're wrong
---
Also would like to know this with default UI and nameplates.
---
Not true. It detects players outside of rendering distance sometimes. It also detects players out of line of sight. Hell, it can detect players at the BRD entrance when you’re at the surface of Searing Gorge.
---
People play this game solely for the PvP, Rogues will continue to one of the strongest PvP class. I don't play a Rogue but it's stupid to be mad at people who do
---
People fight on the boats? Utter savages.
---
Hunter / Druid loses their advantage of being able to track humanoids since everyone has Spy installed.
---
You don't need to be 60 -- I'm keeping my shaman as an honorless gray 47 until BGs because she can still hit 60s for ~1k, and heal. Since you're gray they ignore you, then quickly regret that.
---
https://youtu.be/dR_m8lHwayE
---
https://youtu.be/mieFlRUHhdE
---
I like how people like you roll on a PvP realm then complain about PvP... How did you not anticipate this?
---
Love this!
---
Leveling on Pagle I’d flag up whenever I saw a horde. I treated it more as a duel to the death than true World PvP but it was still plenty fun.
---
Now I can’t wait for BGs because all the not corpse running has set my 39 Ret Paladin Twink to be a menace
---
If anything you're at least living proof that Alliance is just as bad when the tables are turned :)
---
Nice Keybinds LUL
---
Even 60 with bis doesn't help against being ganked by 3-4 vs. 1 even if they wear all greens
---
Depending on your class it can even hurt. 
---
Warrior bis has way too much Non-plate due to the assumption that all you need to do is dealing damage and only the Tank is being Attacked, so you do not need to worry about being able to withstand blows. Also a lot of star points wasted on to hit, which while important in PvE is useless in PvP, because hitting players is not calculated with the same method than hitting Mobs
---
Nah you just jump on a barrel jump on the next thing then up to the rafters, most people do it on the first try.
---
Except it checks it via combat log. It doesn't detect anything the game isn't telling you. It's exactly what mods should do.
---
&gt;their only chance to get money
---
If they are actually any decent they can even charge gold for every 5man they run... only chance to get money my ass. If they're not decent however and just die a lot in 5mans because they think its better to tank with dw and deathwish, they should rightfully make net loss in repaircosts.
---
You caught me. I don't want to waste another 3 or 4 months leveling just to catch up with everyone. I could be playing the new Pokemon with my wife that I haven't opened yet because I've been playing Classic. I have other friends who are playing the new Obsidian RPG that just came out. There are other choices abound. I'm not going to waste the precious few gaming hours I have redoing months of work. 
---
If I had any idea the realm would have been like this I would have picked a different one. But alas, on launch day, like everyone else, I picked the first server that I could effectively join, and didn't realize there was a problem until it was too late. I'll stay if it calms down or if they do something to fix it, but my patience runs thin.
---
This. Windseeker is awesome right now. Many raiding guilds. No problem finding a group on offpeak times, world pvp in hillsbrad and orgrimmar gates. Good clean fun here on Windseeker.
---
I played alliance on a horde dominated server in vanilla, it was only the server where all the hardcore PvP players from Dark age of Camelot rolled, so there were a lot of pvp players on this server, and it is notwhere CLOSE to how things are now.
---
There were like 1000 people at level 60 back then and plenty of small groups roaming and ganking stuff. But now there are 6000 level 60 players and it feels like they are all roaming around ganking right now. Back then you'd go somewhere, grind/quest a bit and then you got ganked. Then you resurrected and you were ok for another 30 min or so. Now? You get ganked at the flightpath, then another 3-4 times trying to resurrect. You get to your quest spot/grinding hub - you are ganked and corpsecamped. You are ganked another 5-6 times trying to HS out. My server, Noggenfogger-EU is like 30 - 70 horde favored and you legit cannot do anything in the world without a raid group right now, and even that isn't enough because the horde will just bring 3 raid groups and zerg you anyway.
---
I spent most of my days in vanilla ganking BRM, i ranked to r13 and in TBC i got Gladiator several times. I like PvP, but atm this isn't PvP, it's like a purge. You can't farm anything in the outside world, you can't run to any instance as most groups will dissolve on the way there since you just get ganked and corpsecamped.
---
I've had some fun running with a 10 man group and killing stuff, but that eventually comes to an end when we linger a bit too long in a zone and the horde zerg catches us and we are promptly corpsecamped by 4:1 numbers.
---
Solution: not including information about enemy faction players in the combat log unless you or party at in combat with them
---
Missing this information does not break anything.
---
Thers no upgrade outside the drakestone until the AV exalted offhands. The best raid weapon is mageblade after all. Then claw of chromag plus av offhand or staff of the shadow flame from bwl
---
We're clapping hord on our realm bois! If they're not twice as much they will run like babies... Classic hord behavior
---
Keep the hyperbole going, rude guy.
---
The invis pot is before the 3 engage you, or after you die if you're getting camped.  
---
The real answer is to just not whine on reddit about PvP happening on a PvP server.  Even sides aren't a part of the classic WoW PvP server package, you missed the fine print that was strewn all across reddit on that one bud.
---
Like I really don't understand what people expect from a PvP server.  Everyone will just ignore everyone else instead of fighting, help cross faction players with quests and /wave at them, /dance naked at the quest hubs and have a jolly old time.  Then once in a blue moon two parties of 3 people each join hands on the beach at booty bay and decide to have a good ol fashioned fair fight with one another.  Then after they fight they wait for the losing side to res up, gather around a cooking campfire and emote at each other communicating what great sportsmanship just occurred.  Why in the criminy doo do you think there's two factions and the opposing faction is red to you and you can't communicate with them?
---
My recommendation is arms straight to 60 and arms until you get geared enough as a tank to grab a raid spot or you decide to raid as fury but still tank all dungeons easily 
---
Arms is the far superior trash clearing spec in dungeons and is infinitely better at holding threat on 4-5 mobs then straight prot. 
---
The secret to tanking dungeons at any level is gear, not spec. Stam + armor &gt; defense and threat pieces are important as well. My tank set is essentially my pvp set for the most part
---
I can post my tank dungeon  set  if you'd like so you can get an idea
---
It doesn't come across as whining whatsoever. It made me sad. I was in the same position where real life friends either quit or mostly quit, and I know that can sort of kill some of the fun, but you'll meet a solid group in game. Here's my advice: If you want to gear your warrior up, you could offer to tank but reserve dps gear or at least advertise that it is your main spec and you will be rolling. This is perfectly reasonable and tanks are highest in demand so groups come much easier. You also don't need full bis by any means to start raiding.  
---
Healing is a great option too. Your goal should be to make friends with tanks. Add every single tank you do find and invite them to run dungeons. Together you will always be able to find groups. As for a guild, don't be afraid to move around until you find what you're looking for. A lot of people don't take guilds too seriously while leveling and make their decision at 60 when it comes time to raid. It wasn't until I hit 60 and found a raiding guild that I finally got in discord with people and we became closer. Just be on the lookout for people moving at the same pace as you.
---
I'm not complaining I just said horde control their fair share it's not alliance dominated.
---
That being said the boat auto ress abuse to farm honour is annoying, love this subreddit community so angry about everything
---
i play on a server thats roughly 60:40. dont get me wrong, ive had my fun, but im truly disliking how lopsided it is for personal reasons. im a druid. if i decide to try to get a duel with someone 1v1, it almost always ends up with a throng of 2-5 from the other faction running through...
---
For my twink I respecced from ele to resto and am now only dungeon grinding but even that is annoying with the death squads camping entrances. It takes the group like half an hour to get inside in the first place
---
I use 1 2 3 4 5 6, alt 1 2 3 4 5 6 on the regular bar. Then the extra bar above I use shift 1 2 3 4 5 6, f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6. The extra bottom right bar I use keys like F G H R `. People also use ctrl 1 2 3 etc but I personally don't find that comfortable. Just do what suits you!
---
Nice categorization. I had no romantic thoughts about PvP whatsoever , as I remember playing late Vanilla through WotlK on a PvP server. I think I'd fit right into category 2. However, my supposed lvling buddy quit classic. Leveling in anything but the starting zones kinda sux now tbh...
---
I highly don't think so
---
for one thing, they completely removed how fury warrior played post MoP. we are now more or less like the ret paladins, fishing for procs rather than pooling and doing crazy bursts of damage (even in classic, where execute phase brings in a shit ton of burst and that is without a lot of the other CDs we get) I want to DELETE people in pvp when geared (IE the standard sucks early on, then become god by last patch), and I want to go ham on CDs in PvE. 
---
for another, they still have the RNG gear stuff up, I hated the fact that in order to get BiS I had to get lucky.
---
And then you get mythic gear from non mythic raiding sources, maybe Mythic+ 5 mans but the whole weekly stuff from WoD was garbage.
---
I highly doubt I will go back to retail at this point, unless they do a 180 on their design philosophy.
---
*getgud.jpg*
---
You’re actually right about single server BGs, that would go a decent way to get people to side with the underdog.
---
Just joking lol
---
"Take 100% increased damage from plastic waste"
---
Issue is the share number of people on every server. I played PvP back in vanilla just fine, the occasional gank just adding to the feeling that the world is not a safe place.
---
There wasn't a pluss sized raid group of level 60s in each levelling zone back then however, nor was there 10 or more players at every flightmaster.
---
i srsly miss being able to hide behind trees or in a cave. LOS worked vs eyes too back in the day
---
The intricacies of virtue signaling
---
\#nochanges tho
---
Didnt mean youre new. Meant this is the game
---
It's actually great. Because of them it's easy for me to form a group. I just type "no reserved item shenanigans" when making a group and I get frequent replies
---
Damn, someone is butthurt
---
At least it's in the middle of the zone, contrary to the alliance FP
---
Yes they can. No one reads stupid logs in a fight. And if they can more power to them
---
Spy ruined everything. Playing a Rogue is pointless now
---
Click the name
---
Yeah thats why rogues are so bad in duels.  The dueler never knows the rogue is there and gets super shocked.
---
Improved gouge is 5.5s, it takes 5s to drop combat
---
It doesnt work vs every class tho because of batching if someone is spamming a ranged attack out of the gouge it will usually break your restealth, but vs bad players or people with no range abilities or in dead zone you can get a restealth
---
Yeah that'd be great, also if you attack people fishing I hope you get aids
---
That also works
---
I have no idea. I understand that it's unplayable for you guys.
---
It's my favorite phase for PVP and it's actually Playable, releasing WSG will kill that phase. I know it's only a fraction of the playerbase but none of the side should pay for blizzards mistake. 
---
This sound like the only solution for 90% of the playerbase so I understand your POV, but it clearly will be a bummer for me.
---
Why does everyone act like every single server has 5 time the population when it's straight up not true? I play on a huge server because I want to, I'm not going to call or people who have a different preference.
---
Horde I think
---
F
---
ClassicAuraDurations.
---
I’m having a different experience for the same reasons. Before honor, there was a stressful moment whenever you saw horde because you weren’t sure if they were going to attack. If they did, it was almost always in a fight that you couldn’t win, and *always* left me frustrated.
---
I got fed up with people killing me for no reason. I mean, fighting over resources is one thing, but just killing me for no reason other than I’m low seemed downright mean. 
---
Now there’s never any doubt, even for a moment. Red is dead, always. If I die, that Horde is getting honor and progressing towards something, so it’s fine. Also, since I can expect everyone to attack me, I’m playing the game differently. No more solo play in the open world if I can help it, and even so I’m always ready for a fight.
---
PvP being meaningful just makes the game way more fun all around.
---
it can keep a rogue out of stealth
---
I'm stalagg horde and Its straight up boring over here. I feel bad for the alliance, everything is camped by the horde. Sometimes the alliance muster a resistance for a min but not for long.
---
P2 first night there were so many horde in BRM alliance guilds had to corpse run at least a dozen times. We're talking multiple full horde raids at all the entrances/jumps/pathways/teleporter killing everyone as soon as they rez.
---
You're lucky you're on heartseeker. I know a few of the better alliance guilds there from pservers and they are pretty ass a PvP. Probably like shooting fish in a barrel.
---
world pvp in a nutshell: Either you dominate to the point of it not even being fun, or you are being dominated to the point of it not being fun.
---
... I have played on private Servers as well as Vanilla and now classic. 
---
I know what I can expect and I know what I want. 
---
I don't think I would have leveld to 60 this many times over and over again just because "buyers remorse" and "sunk cost fallacy". 
---
That would work if I leveld to 60 the first time and just now realized how shitty the game is. 
---
But I am quite certain I know what I can expect and what I get and I am very pleased with that up to this Point. 
---
Could always Change in the future but so far (even with World PVP) I still like it a lot. Just the mass world pvp lags are a Little annoying..
---
You're obviously the one withour reading comprehension. Im agreeing with the OP. You're not. Are you daft?
---
Today I got killed by a guard because I used self defense when Horde attacked me first. I killed him and then guard killed me
---
Thx game good jokes
---
Yuk
---
My thoughts exactly. Blizzard will probably treat every patch in the same way. Every time they see a drop in popularity they'll release another patch - whether it's good for the community or not.
---
pVE iS nOt rEaL wOW 
---
Get fucked pvp realms, come back when you can actually PLAY the game.
---
Plenty of world pvp in Hillsbrad, then I go about my business when I've had my fun.
---
Yes, enjoy while IT last s... Alliance soon will die-out. My example I played like 8-10h a day now log in only for MC/Nyxia
---
You can't go pvp to pve
---
if  you want BGs fuck off to a pve server! (think about it)
---
Thats pretty much impossible since there is a slight delay when you land. They can just AoE you down before you get your first hit of.ba
---
thats not what your posts say. youre too dumb to argue with Im gonna block you to avoid this in the future.  good luck in life
---
Even if people did start abusing it, as you call it, there is no guarantee that Blizzard would do anything about it - changing the combat log API would probavly end up breaking so many other add-ons in the same go.
---
You might just make the wPvP arena even more intolerable with this strategy, with nothing to show for in the end in terms of changes. Just saying. Coming from someone who's not using Spy (yet).
---
Open horde to ally transfers, make blizzard stats for a/h ratio public. Make your faction healthy.
---
Fight for this, not for wsg ffs.
---
Sure, except when Alliance raids  wait on the deck below or there's a rogue  prowling around.  Not fun seeing your corpse taking a trip to Undercity and back.
---
If you're a pet class, you can select the caracter (if not stealth/out of range/...) and send your pet to attack them.
---
In those 12/13 month they will roll out all the phases, and then leave classic stay this way to die
---
The player can (without any addons) with his human eyeballs look at his combat log to see enemies nearby.
---
The addon only highlights what is already shown to the user.
---
Flight master would be dead probably, making difficult for you to go to the next fp
---
Imagine hating dogs 
---
This guy is a twisted fucking cyclepath
---
It's not about honour, it's about sending a message.
---
tbc fucking sucks, world pvp was dead, itemisation was fucked and madeup lore was weak
---
I’m fairly sure he would’ve gone holy already if that interested him
---
Not sure about the party leader but you can reset with people still inside. They'll just be in the old instance till they walk out and in while you're in the new one.
---
You can also try the concert to raid, invite sixth player log off reset trick.
---
Vanilla WoW is an attempt to recreate the old game for the people who want to play it. Which by definition means there should be no changes. So you're either like it or go back to retail. Simple as that.
---
I can't even play the game. We were barely able to get I to Mc, leveling my lats is out of the question.
---
Idk what has changed, but it wasn't like this back in the day, not at all.
---
You wanted your friend to roll on ally to get pallies didnt u
---
Since , you know, pink :D
---
&gt; The funny thing is if you're leveling as horde
---
I'm on a somewhat balanced server horde side ( pop is 55% horde-45% alliance afaik ) and I still get ganked/killed by "??" players, or Xv1 etc.. on a constant basis don't worry. I've been killed by the 2 same gnome mages around 10 times in Dustwallow yesterday, then hunted and killed by a pair of human rogues another 10 or so times. Don't worry, some of us horde players live the same thing as you.
---
yeah, that really is what hes trying to do. On my server (pvp,eu) it was like that even before the honor system came. The dicks who ganked, camped and griefed did it without or with honor, they dont care.
---
No it doesn’t.
---
No but it’s clearly the players dude.
---
Players: “Blizzard, we want X!”
---
Blizzard: “Sure, here you go.”
---
Players: “But this isn’t X, it’s just a massive turd shaped like X.”
---
Blizzard: “You really don’t know what you want, do you ?”
---
Players: “...”
---
Also every single beta has had tons and tons of constructive feedback that’s been ignored over and over again, resulting in the steaming of pile of shit that is BfA. But surely that’s the players’ fault.
---
"If you dislike it, then go and ask blizzard to fix the A/H ratio, cause they can do it. Stop suggesting battlegrounds and other shit... like really?" 
---
How would blizz do it ???
---
Depends entirely on your server and faction. But with just lvl 30 you should be fine. From my experience most pvp players ignore grey players, unless they are attacked first.
---
15 days is around 2-3 times slower than most people i know.   
---
!!That being said, aslong as you enjoyed it. !!!
---
For reference - Personally i dont enjoy leveling.  Powerd to 60 within week 2 of the servers going live (rsham/warr combo) 
---
And. Started leveling a priest 6 days ago - its lvl 50 now.   I personally dont enjoy leveling. Ive done it before, in each expansion, on each class.  I play to raid and pvp.  
---
Just have fun with how you spend your time.
---
"How could I know that the Horde would be the biggest faction" 
---
Eeehm.. because they're heavily favored whilst questing? Because they have mid level instance in their blue zones ? Because they have the best racials? Because they their continential traveling in blue zones? Because they have better/more towns in questing areas? 
---
Everything in Classic is heavily Horde favored. And everyone knows it.
---
&gt; In those 12/13 month they will roll out all the phases, and then leave classic stay this way to die
---
"Die" there were multiple populated classic private servers in end phase of the game when Classic launched. It won't die for a long time.
---
It’s been brutal as an alliance , mid 30’s discipline priest but I’m playing more than ever and embracing the bullshit. Met some really cool people as well
---
Not being a dick just giving advice...you gotta meet up and ride out to the dungeon together. Discuss it with the group as you guys are forming up.
---
reddit is blowing the problem WAY out of proportion.
---
im sure on some servers the imbalance is noticable.
---
but i highly doubt its as bad as reddit makes it out to be.
---
im playing on a 40-60 server myself.
---
for ever 2 allies there are 3 hordes.
---
and yet im having no problem at all.
---
Nobody is trying to blame you really. No single Horde is to blame for faction imbalance. 
---
It is just the Overall Situation a lot of People are venting about.
---
It isn't even necessarily the majority that feels this way - it is the vocal minority.
---
I do get it though - especially if you are not 60 yet. It is getting very difficult.
---
Either way one Group in the game is going the get a bummer with early or not early release of BG's.
---
World PVP won't completely die out. It will become less but still be a Thing. But People will actually be able to quest again :D
---
I myself don't care. I'm alliance and I knew I was most likely going to be the minority in PVP and I like that. 
---
I still get the other People complaining though. As a 50 you really don't want to spend 2 out of your 2 1/2 hours corpserunning...
---
ah nothing to be ashamed about \^\^
---
hmm lets see, Op is 8 levels below and has 10% hp sounds doable 👍
---
Reserving orbs and charging gold for runs arent the same for you lol? Could you tell me other ways to farm gold as a tank warrior because you look like a really smart person.
---
Except that won't do squat as people will just hangout in different locations
---
This is the type of content I like to see. Blizz really should do something and fast before the masses just quit
---
That rogue is garbage. A good rogue would not allow you 1 single GCD
---
I was always in favor of queues instead of layering, but that wasn't my decision.
---
I play on a PvE server and since they removed layers it's really hard to quest. And it's hard to get immersed into the danger of a scary world if everything is always dead from a legion of player running rampant.
---
If they are not going to fix these overpopulated servers I would prefer they bring back layers. Layers are shit, but at least we were able to play. (And before you tell me to transfer, there isn't a free transfer to a non-RP server available for me.)
---
On EU: Shazzah as alliance I cant set my foot outside IF and even inside IF you can find horde rouges in less populated areas (train, fish trainer etc)
---
This is not fun for enyone, how horde will farm their honor10" if all alliance will un-sub?
---
I play on Zandalar Tribe as horde - level 60 shaman. The world pvp is pretty bad right now (as with any pvp server) but currently I'm feeling its pretty equal between the factions, seeing just as many horde gank groups running around as alliance gank groups. However, the server is slightly tilted towards alliance iirc from statistics (\~55/45 A/H). We as horde have no problem formning Pug-raids and dungeon groups.
---
I can't speak for alliance about RP, but the RP on horde is sparse but it does exist - mainly through gathering events and guild events. Its fun to attend to I tihnk as it gives you a reason to reflect in game which is calming for me.
---
The main difference I find on Zandalar Tribe compared to other servers is that the community feels more mature. Very few speak in "leet speak", people are generally more laid back and patient. I'd say that if you're more of an elitist then this is not a server for you.
---
I've yet to regret my server choice even though the PvP is what it is currently.
---
The Luffa trinket from slaying the Incendosaurs in Searing Gorge.
---
Depends on your class, I don’t know much about rogues but I capped my priest in about 10 days. My hunter is 50 with 3 days 12 hours played. Probably won’t be touching hunter now till phase 3 when I can actually quest again. Lol
---
My assumption is weakaura, but I personally prefer tellmewhen.
---
How about not making decisions based on less than a week ? no?
---
If you want to advocate #nochanges, we should start by lowering the server cap again to vanilla. That would solve the phase 2 issue.
---
Complains about posts being negative all the time... Can't get through their own post without it devolving into insulting people who disagree with them.
---
Nah, it's cool because it lets me know what places to avoid so I don't get jumped by ten 60s.
---
Problem with faction queues is that they would effect the majority population on all servers negatively, which obviously means it would effect the majority of all players overall. And even as the minority on a server it seems unlikely to me that Blizzard would do something that would piss off so many others :/
---
Look at crit the crits of your autoshots, aimed shots and multi shots, our dps is only high if we crit a lot. I have full T1 and sometimes other hunters in my raid have higher average damage with their multi because they crit 2 or 3 more.
---
I don't like what spy has done to the game either, but I *need* spy to know that I need to drop some defensive totems or I don't even get to play the game against a rogue. Call me bad all you want.
---
You are worth no honor when you come out of a loading screen and when you land at a flight point for 30 seconds.
---
first world problems much? I am lvl 49 with mostly lvl 35 gear lmao, rng was not kind to me xd
---
&gt; The problem is the servers having up to 10x the populations of canilla servers, primarily. 
---
Where do you guys get these insane statements? There is no fucking way we've got 30.000 concurrent players on Classic Servers. Please. Stop this bullshit lying.
---
Blizzard stated **when servers were layered** that there were vastly more people per realm. **We do not know the server capacity for concurrent players post-layer removal.**
---
It could be the original 3000 concurrent players or it could be 5000, but it sure as hell isn't 30000!
---
Sucks bro. 
---
But you are right. It is probably not that Girl which you are into )maybe it is but you'll get over it) but more the idea of having a girlfriend that fits into that scheme of being cute, Kind and playing Computer games. 
---
Don't we all wish for that one waifu material? :P
---
I see you feel really guilty but you don't have to because I'm quite sure you just like the idea of it but would never betray your friend. 
---
Just Keep at it bro. Sooner or later you will also find the one that just fits :)
---
Afterall you are only 30 yet. Still a lot of time to find her :P
---
At 48+ you give honor. If I see someone below 48 I just leave them. In hopes they level up faster to 48 so I can kill them for honor :DDDDD xD
---
The player makes the RPG, the game only provide the support.
---
Most RPG can be played as a Kill/Loot/Repeat and most players enjoy this.
---
Few are those who will fully embody a character and take decisions based on his background and knowledge. Most will play their own role in every game and that's not how an RPG was initially designed to be played.. but as long as the player enjoy the ride, who cares ?
---
So you could call anything an RPG but you would only be playing yourself ;)
---
I bet you are one of those ganking lvl 52 clothies. What an achievement that must be
---
Oh yes, wise PvP master, I will pass your advice on to the rest of my party.
---
Edit: nope, still had to corpse hop the whole thing. Turns out 5 mid-low 50's toons cannot handle 20+ geared out lvl 60's.
---
Hey man. I feel you. But don't despair nor quit. In a single run you will find 3 pieces in a row for you. Just keep farming that dkp
---
No regrets, at least PVP is dynamic.
---
&gt; Let us PAY for our mistake Blizzard.
---
you are paying by not being allowed to transfer. 
---
;)

[Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)  
---
But you will be ganked non-stop everywhere. Any Horde player of same level will attack you with 90% chance.
---
Pro players in CS:Go dont win an ungodly amount more than those they play with and against in ranked either. Its a team game, where you play 5v5, one player can only do as much.
---
And, add the fact that they face really good players as well, just because those they face arent pros, but they are no slouches.
---
The only real games where you can achieve and 80-90% WR is in an RTS, or another similar heavily skill based 1v1 game, in a setting where you are clearly the best player in the world, and even then those winrates are hard to get, just based on the general randomness of games, openings, general strategy etc.
---
So while I agree that OW is a pretty bad game in order to show of your skill as a standalone player, your argument is heavily flawed.
---
If you're playing on EU servers, Zandalar Tribe seem to have small Alliance advantage over Horde. There are still times where Horde fucks you all the way to BRS or take over the boat to Menithil, but more often than not I've seen Alliance patrolling road to BRS and kicking Horde off our ship. Still, the balance changes zone to zone, hour to hour, but that only makes it feel like a real war with two factions fighting over control of neutral flight points and zones for their lowbies to quest in.
---
Just level up in dungeons while farming your prebis. Instead of leveling to 60 in zones and THEN doing the dungeons for gear while getting 0 XP. 2 months ago I leveled my mage from 51-60 only in dungeons. Was almost full prebis by the time I hit 60, felt pretty good.
---
personally, I’m farming my brotherhood reputation, at least from neutral to honored. Farming incendosaurus, then going in brs form war iron residues. Getting thick leather in the same time.
---
I also plan to farm leather and items for the dark moon fair, a bit in advance. Can also make some sweet gold out of this, and can farm in zones that are not 50+.
---
You just move the combat log chat to a different window and you see the rogue performing abilities or stealthing in there without the addon. Its been there ever since :P
---
Is it because no gear drops or it goes to others?
---
I wonder why?
---
Old school stereotypes never hold water.
---
Orc rogues are superior based on racials alone.
---
Stun resistance and a damage boost, yes please.
---
What's that you say? No WotF? Well, a rogue gets to pick his fights. When you see a warlock, equip your shadow reflector and (soon) PvP trinket. 2 trinkets to help you destroy them. Do it right and you'll nevere need WotF.
---
Ehh, there's a solution - play Legion instead. You get handed legendary items without having to do a goddamn thing. Feels so good, too.
---
&gt;Any Horde player of same level will attack you with 90% chance.
---
Two-way street, my man.
---
No, because private servers usually have better faction ratio, so world pvp is actaully fun.
---
When you play on  a server with 2-1 or 3-1 ratio, its not fun.
---
First thing: You shouldn't go RP-PVP if you don't want to RP
---
Second: No, most players on RP realms play the game how it's supposed to be, they just get a bit more into their character, for example if you want to trade someone, you do an emote before. If you want to do instances with big story mode, you really have to search for that kind of players, even on RP realms
---
That's some crazy racism here.
---
Or stop trying to please a fanbase who will ALWAYS have something to cry about
---
Oh dear old nemesis, always desire what you can't get. Get out and find someone else, there are enough who will reciprocate your feelings and this is even better.
---
Doing your best isn't bad it's when you start excluding People who aren't min maxxing it's a problem
---
Lol go away
---
I play on a server that is around 50/50. I don't really experience the problem that many are facing here. That being said, would of been cool if Blizzard made it like CSGO. When there are 4k Horde and only 2k Alliance, if you want to join that server, only as an Alliance player. Makes no sense to me, to add another 1k Horde plays
---
Payo uses weak aura for those he set them up at the beginning of the server and it took him a good 12hrs to set them up, it was funny
---
Probably heartseeker, it’s 80:20 alliance
---
What does heavily favored whilst questing mean?
---
Dungeons are true; definite horde advantage there for leveling. Alliance have easier access to some end game, horde have easier access to others.
---
Alliance have better racials. Horde have arguably better 1v1 racials, but alliance have far better pvp racials in organized battle (paladins are the best pve racial a faction can have). 
---
Horde and alliance both have advantages when it comes to towns and settlements. This is a non factor anyway in most places that actually matter (lot of neutral FPs in higher level zones)
---
I don’t know why this subreddit constant circlejerks that alliance are the worse faction. Look at like every top tier guild and see that they’re pretty much all alliance (except a couple hordie ones).
---
&gt; So one comment with negative karma.. means something?
---
Well it was enough for you to edit your comment. So yeah, it seems to mean something to you. Why else bother?
---
Welcome to the last 12 years lol. Nothing ever felt the same when finding new games.
---
Just remember, for every amazing person you've ever been into, there is someone who is fed up with their shit.
---
Sidenote, you are a whole and complete person. Dont look for companionship and it will eventually find YOU.
---
&gt; When I played this game originally, at the start of BC, bigish pvp battles would break out, like I'd gank, hed call friends, then I'd call friends. Was fun.
---
What's the difference? Right now, we get groups of 5-10 people. We start killing alliance everywhere. Alliance calls for backup, they assemble a minor raid, maybe 10-20 people and fight back. More Hordes join in, it's never a fair fight, because constantly people are coming in or moving on.
---
That happened in Vanilla, it was just primarily organized to certain zones, where as now everyone sees a benefit in doing it and are all taking part.
---
People who don't like the current state should simply not play on a PvP server. Stop crying about it.
---
&gt; voice chat Discord with guild mates for like three hours each day
---
My wife doesnt even get that much attention!
---
I don't think there's been a queue-less day on Gehennas since release of Classic and there are no huge streamers there.
---
Best item for druids, since they can't wear any other range slot item until relics release. And you can draw the blaster when cyclung through your weapons with the y-key
---
I can see you're point, but it's not accurate considering the quality and complexity of PvP MMO's launched prior to WoW. If you have not played any of those, then it'll be difficult for you to understand.
---
For example Dark ages of Camerlot is a prime example where there were 3 realms, 24 unique classes, PvP class development spec trees, competitve 8vs8 play in the open world etc. etc.
---
For people coming from those games, WoW PvP was considered simple, rewardless and mechanically not very well thought out. 
---
The real pull however was the warcraft lore and group PvE instances &amp; bosses.
---
&gt; which means they can still do damage if they get spell locked out of shadow by a warlock/mage/rogue/warrior.
---
You will do more damage by just attacking with a wand.  
---
All Nelf priest racials are garbage.
---
Probably heartseeker, there are literally alliance sitting in org killing people who hearth/port back, they own the server.
---
Why do we need the information that some enemy player, who you are not in combat with, just did something or had some buff run out? 
---
also /u/Dmeastlasher, in Vanilla there was no mandatory pvp addon like this at all, because it wasn't as well known. It wasn't an issue back then - today it is and Blizzard should act accordingly.
---
I got lucky with my first MC earning both Benediction and 3 tier pieces. Give it a few weeks if you raid with the same group you will be geared eventually.
---
3 MC's and already complaining.... whahah .. Good luck tho
---
I dont think anyone seriously can argue that Spy is good for the game.  
---
Even if it was possible to use in Vanilla, it wasnt really a thing.  
---
Now its 100% a must have addon for pvp.  
---
And its ruining wpvp hard!  
---
And in bgs it will be the same thing.
---
Yeah you are right, I don’t think it will die soon... I just somehow fear that we won’t get any TBC or Classic+. Blizzard will rush through the phases, leaving casual players more and more behind and will drop classic for shadowlands after Naxx...
---
It's Cross Realm BG's. One premade isn't going to shitstomp everyone. There will be hundreds of games going simultaneously with many of them being PUGs.
---
People will say they killed wPVP, but the real issue is that they make the world feel tiny and featureless. When you're on the ground you have to accommodate the landscape. Particularly interesting set pieces become your landmarks for navigating the world. It feels like navigating your way to the store in real life, and that contributes to a sense that you are living in the game world.
---
Once you can fly everywhere you stop thinking in terms of "oh, it's just past the gorilla cave and on the left". You don't get exposed to any content other than what you need for this specific quest. That makes the world feel emptier.
---
Dunno either, but I guess we'll see. Unless Blizz resolves this I'm ending my subscription this month. I've played 4-8 hours almost every day since launch and this is just too much. I don't know how someone can be so much of an asshole that he's able to camp lvl51s for extended periods of time in a 10+ group. I mean sure I've seen alliance players killing 1-2 horde guys when passing through some place, but they move on or at least they used to. But horde no, they just stay in that place and corpse camp that guy till he disconnects. At this point I honestly want the game to fail, because scumbags like this do not deserve any more of it.
---
Aight. Cant wait for the next UFC fight where McGregor has to fight 5 trained dudes over his weightclass.
---
It's wild west out here. The weak get eaten by the strong.
---
Weak ones go complaining on forums. Strong ones have a blast.
---
Some find strength in numbers and bulldoze with that advantage. Some, in themselves.
---
I hate wsg for this reason so much. Both teams have the others flag both in glitched spots. 2 hour stalemate.
---
its all the filthy casuals whining
---
I love it now :D
---
Huh, interesting. I guess having originally played on a horde dominated server in vanilla and TBC, being able to fight back now feels like having an advantage.
---
bubble hearth
---
It's not semantics, it's about the game not words. The game isn't working as intended and that's why people love it. Changing the game now to suit players desires is how it went bad.
---
Yeah, but that's kinda my point. Max range Hunter with track humanoid gets the engage on everyone except a rogue who gets the engage on everyone. Warriors eat shit from literally everyone. Spy actually just evens the field from that point of view.
---
PvP was super unfair even without Spy. I'm not a fan of Spy per se, but I'm also not a fan of getting globalled in a stunlock or getting globalled in Hunter kite.
---
It doesn't matter what people wanted in the past. We love in the present and there's clearly a problem that needs to be addressed.
---
Good question to which I don't have an answer. It may be worth testing that. I've got to say that sometimes I have seen a name, clicked on it and I couldn't target due to range (and it wasn't people flying).
---
I feel sorry for all the lvl 48-59s out there. i /sorry emote them whenever i kill them. But as long as the only way to get honor is to gank ppl i will keep doing it. At 85k honor this week sofar, 2days left. Hoping to land in a decent bracket.
---
Suggesting changes to the game based on LESS THAN ONE WEEK of gameplay is not only mob mentality but also completely stupid.
---
How about you wait a little till the dust settles ?
---
Funner than the other option, I'm guessing.
---
Practice. My first 60 took forever to level like almost 8 days played and I have been able to shave it down to 6 on my 3rd. Aiming for under 6 is my goal for the end of the year.
---
&gt; obviously didn’t play 15 years ago
---
Ad hominem. /Discussion.
---
I don't get it.
---
????????????????????????
---
BGs are like 500000 times more important than fixing an addon that shouldn't be "fixed"
---
Me and a buddy managed to kill a skull player the other day and we netted 200+hp each from him, versus 20-30 for players around our level.
---
So it is a possibility.
---
The keypresses you specify will also be sent to all or specific game windows.  I. E. You press "1", all 3 game clients receive the keypress "1". 
---
 Targetting works through /assisting a lead character and movement is generally done with /follow, sending movement keys,  and a combination of Click to Move and Interact With Target which can be used to make your melee characters attempt to run in a straight line in to melee range of your current, interactable target (enemies, quest givers, etc).
---
I have /petattack and /petstay bound to Q and E and that’s been quite useful.
---
that would be great.
---
i assume blizzard set the server size so high because they expected the playernumbers to drop hard after a week.
---
you know. since classic is mostly nostalgia /s. :D
---
setting the loginque to trigger earlier, opening new servers and letting the playerbase disperse. i think the poeple playing now have a high chance to play long term. making transfers feasable and making it possible to create healthy server polulations.
---
Yeah, the data didn't match my own server either (it's much worse than it seems). So, in any case, Ashbringer is still probably the best PVP server for Alliance...which is not saying much.
---
And using spy will let you know you're being tracked even before the Hunter can see you on the minimap.
---
Very true, however. Killed at every corner when your faction is outnumbered 3:1
---
7 is kinda religious and mythical number so it's used in stories and fantasy a lot.
---
Come on fellas. Adapt. Whining is not vanilla wow. #nochanges ;)
---
Wait, 5v1? What the heck.
---
That is so sick. 
---
What server are you playing on? I need to make a character there, cause on my server it's more like 40v1 - and not in my factions favor.
---
Factions were generally much more balanced in vanilla. The knowledge about the imbalance between racials and the easier questing/leveling experience of horde has made horde the dominant faction now.
---
Don't join big raids. Make a 5 to 10 man group and go out to find similar groups.
---
Just act like thing's wrong, maybe you're old enough for them to mistake you for a forsaken.
---
And true, you just have to see how everyone's mind is changing every fucking week. We do really think we do but we don't.
---
So please, stop overreacting to everything and try to be more calm.
---
P2 has been out for not even 1 week and people are already acting likke it ruined the game it's ridiculous. How about we give it a little time ?
---
Would like to see Arathi Basin and WSG pre phase 3. However I think the Alterac Valley quest and rep items are too powerful pre BWL. Looking at you Unstoppable Force...
---
Good!
---
&gt;45-55 balance is when action needs to be taken.
---
People look at 45-55 and say "it's just 10% more" when they don't realize that it's already 22% more. For every 5 people in the Alliance, there are 6 for the Horde. That 20 man zerg group you're making to fight in BRM? The Horde has 24. It's the tipping point indeed. 
---
The Alliance on many servers will die. They will not get to raid AQ or Naxxramas because of the lack of people.
---
no? just premade stomping. reroll on a pve server.
---
I know they usually just trying to be helpful, but I I'm so fucking tired of the "you should run in together" comments
---
"Aim for the bushes"
---
??? they see u first
---
You can turn in 5 shellfish for 55s
---
lol @ curse of recklessness, I'd never ask a warlock go to silithus just for that
---
We waited 30-40 mins for some raiders yesterday to Get through the queue. Ended up with over 200 HK, disbanded one onyxia raid and delayed 3 other guilds for about an hour. Best waiting I’ve had so far :) Payback Alliance :)
---
World pvp isn't about premades min maxing honor gains after playing tons in private servers. ALso this shit wasn't fun even back then
---
&gt; It’s no secret that, for most people, the experience is absolute hell.
---
Citation needed. Are you sure MOST people actually have this experience?
---
Now you know what it feels like playing with only one FP in STV as Alliance.
---
i saw a group without a hunter in it, so your entire argument is flawed, sorry bro
---
Oh, I'm adapting for sure. By rerolling on a normal server.
---
Was just like that during phase 1 for me too, might be the most fun I've had in an MMO ever. And if it was still like what you're talking about for everyone, no one would be upset. But you have to realize, most servers are heavily skewed towards Horde. The people who are complaining are not having the same experience you're having at all.
---
Alright, if it truly was the same deal in vanilla I challenge you to find a video of a player using suck an add-on on YouTube.
---
Farm places that are hard to get to or very remote and thus unlikely to be visted by roaming PvP squads. Examples might be:
---
- Back of Hearthglen
---
- Underground parts of Searing Gorge
---
- Deep inside the elite demon area of Winterspring
---
- Silithus
---
As a level 40 it's great. I've been questing and running into the occasional horde who I can stealth up on and probably get murdered by since I'm still shit at druid pvp yet
---
Nostalgia only make me remember the nice shit lol.
---
You forgot the main ones: Because they are the most played faction in retail, especially at a competitive level.
---
Because you can see it in combat log? All it does is drawing info from the combatlog - with that, any sort of easy-of-life addons should be banned too.
---
Don't downvote me, just because you don't know how the addon works.
---
[Relevant](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/025/090/tumblr_inline_p1brmcd9Dk1rr08jv_500.jpg)
---
&gt;the current one is the most populated French server.
---
That's straight up lying.
---
When I Have 2000 in queue on Sulfuron I always can log in instantly on Auberdine. It is absolutely NOT the most populated french server
---
Clearly he is on the superior side. 
---
"Usual activities?" Well, my usually activities before p2 launched didn't include corpse running for 45 minutes just to get inside an instance.
---
Because I personally can't stand the Horde races and areas. Also, to think that if I roll Horde I would be surrounded by fellow bandwagoners...
---
Currently lvl 53 Alliance on Venoxis-EU. Really feels like old times, was ganked a few times. Was not that bad yet. Probably gonna eat my words, but so far it is fun.
---
??? the point of spy is that it alerts you way before you are visible
---
Added to that, players screaming for the removal of layering.
---
Blizzard spend months trying to convince people to switch servers, offers free transfers, pleads with people to reconsider being on max pop servers. No one listens.
---
P2 drops.
---
Players rage about Blizzard needing to fix their servers and how world PvP is ruined.
---
And people wonder how we got to retail...
---
the way to fix it is release BGs. done.
---
Luckily I got to 56 when phase 2 came out then I just ran and ran and ran BRD, UBRS and DM. Luckily I'm a healer so I got groups fast and spell cleave groups. But yeah,56-60 just doing dungeons was brutal (but I have 1/2 of my Bis)
---
1 picture: with layers
---
2 picture: layers removed
---
3 picture: pvp system added, so everyone is outside of cities to battle
---
so is the warlock, mash deathcoil while you're in a cheap shot and you're absolutely asking for it to be gouged/KS'd/vanished
---
yeah so they can find you and kill you
---
remove that first, if the "problem" of world pvp persists, then add BGs
---
Well it's more fun leveling an alt when they come out for sure.
---
They should have done something about it before release, not now. The only realistic thing they could do right now is to kill the idea of doing cross-realm BGs. Non-realistic things would include free faction changes and stuff like that...which they won't do.
---
Yeah a rogue can sneak onto one and stay inside, but getting there sucks without a huge raid that can aoe down the guards. Didn't they also inadvertently buff goblin guards in an attempt to fight neutral town griefing?
---
I am not questing lol, that's suicide atm
---
well tell us what the play is here then
---
Nope only horde can do that. As alliance the only thing you can do is bend over or take a break, which most are doing niw
---
i think it should be removed so i can enjoy world pvp
---
I think you meant 'temporarily'
---
player vs players
---
Dude. You have a buff that makes you worth ZERO honor for 30 seconds when you exit a dungeon or a Flightmaster. Its literally not worth anything.
---
&gt; actualy have and spend money as opposed to you basement dwelling neckbeards who barely scrape together a monthly sub then complain about everything.
---
What are you doing on classic then ? Go play retail and keep your micro-transaction ass to clash of clans, nobody needs this kind of "player"
---
On US servers 60/40 is a GREAT ratio. Try playing on Fairbanks where you can't farm, quest, or even fly into a contested zone
---
i disregarded everything you said since you assume that EVERY ranker is in a group with a hunter. what about 3 rogue groups? u can hide from them very easily
---
Oh yea, because "Spy" is the only reason you average 1k honor per day
---
73k downloas in 11 years.  
---
Also, 2010 was in WOTLK days.  And there has been plenty of private servers and such that have boosted those numbers since vanilla.  
---
And the same goes for older versions.
---
Arguing that spy (or similar) was something that people or high ranking pvper used in vanilla is just 100% a lie. Maybe some did, but trying to argue that this was a staple for pvp in vanilla is just WRONG!  
---
And not only is it wrong , you KNOW its wrong.  
---
And if you are indeed right, please link me some high rank pvp videos from back then, where the player is using this addon!  
---
I mean if it was a staple of classic pvp, surely all high pvpers would be using it, and be seen in their pvp vids!
---
people that need mana, usually go for the runes instead, which they do share a cooldown with.
---
This might be the worst pvp video i've ever seen
---
I’ve never tried to sneak into gromgol so I’m not sure. Wouldn’t be surprised by the gob buffs
---
How long did that take you?
---
You do know that the top rankers in APES are two rogues working together? They were at 93k  honor on saturday.
---
No what he's saying is that he can't realize that there are assholes at all levels of anything. At the top you can have your dickbags who call you a casual cause you suck (and you probs do to be fair) and you have your shit players who tell you to kys and probs also call you casual despite being a casual themselves.
---
Almost like it's just called being an asshole. Play the game you wanna play it but also expect since you're playing an MMO that there are other players playing the game the way they want to play and that directly/indirectly affects you. You signed up to play an MMO, some people take games seriously fam.
---
So you rather see [your opposing faction] reroll or transfer to a PVM server?
---
lol dont be mean
---
Wish I could downvote this harder. Stop trying to ruin our game because you can't handle it.
---
I pvp for fun not to rank. I'll camp you all day
---
So its your fault then.
---
Don't make us pay for your mistakes
---
I’m more surprised this guy has 3 MH dal rends.
---
...because of spy ;)
---
why dont you just hide? like you said ;) because of spy ;)
---
Imagine being a virgin in mummys basement not having to care about real life
---
The fact that you put so incredibly little thought into this and that it wouldn't do a thing to deter the "problem" you're trying to "fix" makes me wonder why I bothered to respond in the first place.
---
Theres already plenty of posts about spy. 
---
Its not going anywhere.  
---
It works both ways. 
---
Good ole ”l2p issue”
---
Rp-PvP servers are basically more chill versions of typical PvP servers with a part of the community (I guess around 10%) being focused on Rp.
---
So far ZT is a great server. You don't have to Rp if you don't want to. But make sure to give your character a lore friendly name and don't disturb other roleplayers or else you will be reported.
---
Starshards is great when you're a pocket healer and you have no Mind Flay.
---
Start with corruption/curse, channel immolation to bait kick of the rogue is shit then death coil fear.
---
Because those dl numbers aren't inflated by pservers at all. Seriously, how dumb are you?
---
How did you expect to troll him with that exactly?
---
If these hundreds of alliance would actually band together, they would actually accomplish stuff.
---
I'm roaming around in a 3-5men death squad and everytime alliance actually took their time to fly from IF to chillwind with two groups to Scholomance we got wiped by 10 people honing in on the honor farmers.
---
No wand is going to do 900 damage over 6 seconds like Starshards. Not amazing, but not as terrible as everyone here seems to paint it.
---
If you're going to be an asshole why not just get a warlock to summon you there?
---
You are pushing the cringe level of this sub to it's limits.
---
Looks like 
---
1. Alliance doing some PvP
---
2. Alliance thinking they’re severely outnumbered. 
---
3. Alliance transferring to heartseeker
---
Many servers are balanced and people are having fun..Ppl who played vanilla expected this and welcome it.
---
Its funny how few people want to ruin it for others and those are mostly retail players who didn't know what world pvp means
---
&gt;A metric fuckton of ally players have quit since then especially on my server Fairbanks.
---
After 4 days. Of course.
---
&gt;  Servers today are WAY bigger than they were in vanilla,
---
I suspect as much. I thought they were supposed to have each layer about the population size of the original server? The high pop servers at least feel a lot bigger.
---
Having played a lot in vanilla, there's no way this is the same size. Even at 3-4AM on a High pop pvp server most of the zones are loaded with players, except maybe the starting zones.
---
#nochanges starts with the vanilla player cap
---
Notice how he didn't respond. Hilarious!
---
Yeah, have fun being stuck on rank 11-12 for weeks straight.
---
I wish I could make a thirty minute long composite of my 42 hunter /ready /saluting and otherwise emoting to level 60 groups of horde. 
---
I would put Benny Hill music behind it. 
---
It would not include any contagious respect.
---
I'm having fun. Level 40 player on Alliance. This is just a reddit circle jerk that'll end in 2 weeks.
---
I even heard (though no idea if it's true) you could even be pickpocketed of the gold you have in your pockets :p
---
you reckon that's viable? to take face shots from a rogue the whole time attempting to bait the kick?
---
For the less informed can someone explain to me what I am looking at plz.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. I rolled PvE after seeing where this was going half a year ago already.
---
lol very wrong
---
What are they supposed to do? If they break the addon its going to destroy like 100 other addons at the same time.
---
It parses your combat logs to determine nearby players, thats it.
---
To make it stop working they literally need to disable features which would destroy addons like damage meters, watch the world burn down when half the games stop working correctly because people bitched about this.
---
I never saw that ever. I bet you didnt either.
---
&gt; every consecutive kill is worth 25% less honor. 
---
What does it fucking change if my evening consists 80% of ressing myself? What fucks do I give if he gets less honor from me? Unless it starts penalizing for corpse camping, which itself is a stupid idea, then it doesn't change a fucking thing if they get -25% or -50% or -90%. At this momement they are hunting lvl51s as a 10 man group camping them as they respawn. What FUCKING DIFFERENCE does it make if they get 5 honor points or 3?
---
You're absolutely missing the bigger picture. This is not about honor points, it's about being an asshole.
---
&gt; Effectivley rendering corpsecamping useless. 
---
Well you're effectively an idiot if you think that what you said in any way fixes the current situation.
---
I'm sure you play undead.. Mage maybe even
---
Apart from every whiney reddit post making this point
---
If you want to rank you are.
---
You prefer 5 lvl 60's on elite in full raid gear running around with a priest instantly using mind vision on you and knowing your exact location?
---
What?
---
So you decide "lets play some wow" and then randomly join dungeons without looking up what you need?
---
Won't solve the problem. Level 55 alt has no room in a world where every zone is being camped/roamed by level 60 groups in full epic.
---
If i use the fire shield from my imp in another player, the aggro from the damage dealth by this buff goes to the player buffed or to the imp?
---
I didn't think neckbeard horde players could type. Colour me impressed!
---
I feel the same as horde on noggenfogger
---
Watch where you go. Plan ahead. Its not hard.
---
If you're going the sub route for leveling please do yourself a favor and stay away from daggers. Just spec into Hemo as early as 30 and use slice and dice with a slow main hand (just like combat swords). It's slower than combat but you'll have Prep and very cool pvp utilities as early as 31 and you can level much easier than daggers. It's the perfect middle ground and it's viable 100%
---
Granted. Though I don't play often, which is the reason. I wasn't in a rush and now paying for it. Paying for the fact I chose a PvP server too. This post was just in the humor man, not looking for sympathy.
---
lol that's a class ability though
---
if there was an addon that let you mortal strike people as a hunter you wouldn't call it evening out the playing field
---
&gt;15 years ago was the same in a smaller scale.
---
That's the key right there. There was actually somewhere to go back then. There isn't now.
---
Explain away Trueshot Aura then
---
If you're SL yes. Otherwise you might as well /beg
---
sucks for holy
---
It doesnt show stealthed users, it shows users who used stealth that were already visible to you.
---
If a player uses stealth outside of your combat log range and walks up to you it wont alert you of shit, it only does that if they are visible and then cast a stealth ability.
---
Backwards! 13 times!
---
Well yeah how else would you beat a group of players? You go get your own group.
---
That's fine, I don't need you to believe me to enjoy my build ;\]
---
If they're OK with a lot of those players to cancel their sub, sure that will be an option.
---
But somehow I think that Blizzard really cares about having a lot of people paying.
---
Yea, most Horde feel the same way about Ali.
---
The reality is, nobody in their right mind engages a fight he won't 100% win. They facilitate this by either being insanely overleveled (Eg. Seal Clubbing) or outnumbering at the least 3:1, but preferably both.
---
Honestly this is what makes WPVP feel so stale. Almost nobody fights at lower levels, everyone just wants to rush to 60 so they can maximize their chances of not being one-shot by a Rogue gang... then wanting to feel good about themselves, so they camp people 10-15 levels (or more) under them. And the cycle continues.
---
The only thing we can hope for is the servers to be given roids and BGs to be implemented soon.
---
I have my hands full with real life too, so I don't even feel bad not renewing my sub until then. Getting corpse camped by Rogues 20+ levels above me no matter which zone I go is definitely not a fun experience.
---
The buffed player. Fireshield is a really underrated ability. In an instance fireshield will usually be around 5% of the tanks damage, a very significant threat boost.
---
However, it does not stack with thorns.
---
These guys right there also had a ton of fun. These speedruns are done to flex and to be the best. The other times they will have the most chill raid environment out of all the guilds. Simply because they kill shit so easily.
---
Nice alts. I leveled mine after I hit 60 on one character first
---
I believe the aggro goes to the player with the buff. Same with Thorns from Druids.
---
I find Ally races bland, although I think elvynn and duskwood are nice areas.
---
Wasn't aware I'm a bandwagoner for thinking shamans are the best class ever, though - news to me.
---
Seriously. We haven't even had the chance to see how Phase 2 will be after a couple weeks.
---
"This should be banned, but I'm not going to suggest a path to get there, and if you disagree with my stance that isn't really a stance because I have no methodology, then F YOU OKAY!!!!!! REEEEEE"
---
World PVP in Nagrand was a pretty big deal when I played
---
How are you not in pvp with anyone in a pvp-contested zone on a pvp server?
---
Also, how exactly would they be able to break it without running a ton of other addons as well? (Tiny Threat, DBM for ones.) 
---
Go on?
---
lol maphack holy fuck you are dense.
---
&gt; Because hardly anyone used mods like this in vanilla.
---
You can thank all those people who kept whining about it day to day on Reddit, where it has 0% chance to reach Blizzard and 200% chance to spread like wildfire, and made sure that everyone knows about it. Now everyone has it installed whether they like it or not because they don't want to be the one sucker with the disadvantage.
---
Imbalanced servers should offer free transfers to more balanced servers. We can fix this without gutting the entirety of Phase 2.
---
People that rank in battlegrounds will be a part of those premades so I don't think they will be the ones crying (and running BG premades is much less cancer than chasing honor across the world). On the other hand, those that are sick of being camped will have much easier time getting to their dungeons.
---
There's absolutely no reason for it to slow down the way you think. The level of metagaming meant progression is purely gated by phases for a ton of people. So you have tons of people who completed their shopping list of pre-BiS with nothing to do other than honor farm, and the amount they need to farm is determined by those who toe the line. Streamer culture, social media etc means that bar will continue to be raised due to outside incentives.
---
did someone use a trigger word? sorry what names can we call people and which names are not allowed to be used?
---
I'm on the 40% Alliance side and I'm happy, but I knew what to expect and it's precisely why I chose to play Alliance. I'm a competitive person so I want to play the game in a challenging way. Sometimes I can outplay/out-organize Horde players and it feels great to overcome them from the underdog position.
---
If I played Horde, I don't think I could feel good about winning any kind of wPvP since I'd be favored from the get go.
---
you are right in that spy is in the same vein as those addons, but if people cry enough blizzard will ban. tbh allowing weakauras/debuff timers/dbm but not this is hypcritical and if blizzard were better they would have made the base ui customisable and banned all addons for fairness' sake
---
And it manages to be kinda funny. It's not like you have it going mountain dew 420 noscope caricature.
---
Make a mouse over skinning macro 
---
Bind macro to mouse wheel down and up
---
Set auto loot on
---
Download leatrix and check the option that says faster auto loot
---
Loot and spam mouse wheel up and down while mousing over the devilsaur
---
Yeah how dare those cowards to stop or reduce their playing because it's no longer fun to them.
---
They should power through for the greater good of WoW Classic!
---
If you spam death coil as soon as you come out of the stun lock there might be a pretty high chance to get your shit reflected.
---
Well it's a solution. I'm not sure complaining about a choice you made to Reddit, and finding comfort with individuals who made the same mistake and are regretting rolling on a PvP server, will fix much. I'm on a PvE server and chillin
---
We're mad about the fa tion imbalance dumbass
---
is there a way to notify my dungeon mates im using feign death instead of them freaking out? something like a standard text that pops up when casting it?
---
Would be a nice rp element. A guard patrol guild that just defends the boats. If you want 100% immersion make it warris and palas only. Defenders of the alliance defending the boats.
---
You will always find a guild looking for shamans for their raid, Windfury totem is love, Windfury totem is life
---
Yes I'm talking about perception's range here. :)
---
And get dunked on
---
Few healers on your back and you're basically a warrior on steroids
---
Every thread about this has the same viable suggestion...
---
Faction queues will fix that.
---
**I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.**
---
**Hordes camping outside BRD try to catch some honor points**
---
**Allys hidden downstairs from zeppelin to STV in search of unsuspecting poor people**
---
**All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.** 
---
**Time to die.**
---
It's not about whether it's hard. It's about whether it's fun.
---
Being farmed by a group of players with no way of fighting back is not fun. Getting your own bigger group and farming their group with no way of fighting back is not fun. PvP is fun when it's competitive, current PvP is like farming mobs.
---
&gt;Wasn't aware I'm a bandwagoner for thinking shamans are the best class ever, though - news to me.
---
Why you feel I was implying it was your case though. Many people are rolling Horde not because they *love* it, but because they know that it's where most competitive players would be, same as retail. That's being a bandwagoner and I'd potentially be doing the same. 
---
Alliance races are bland because Blizzard made them bland in the transition from WC3. WC3 Night Elves and old school Dwarves would have been much cooler. I don't get why Dwarves AND Gnomes both need to be comedic relief. Night Elves were the most played race in WC3 at basically all levels.
---
I'm not lvl 60 yet, but basically yes, if I have some quests to do in a dungeon, I try to run this one.
---
This is a godsend for Hunters when taming new pets
---
No, I can wait the 20s for Perception to fade and then kill you, obviously. Is this genuinely so hard to grasp?
---
What about people on pve servers? We still get the zergs we like without getting bothered while leveling. I am enjoying p2 even when the horde is standing right outside southshore.
---
Very curious what server you're on. I'm on Earthfury and at day 1 of Phase 2 there was only 1 raid vs 1 raid in Hillsbrad, and now nobody is there and the only raids you see roaming around are all on their way to actual raids.
---
I don't really have any opinion on DOTA because I've never played it, I've never played LoL either since MOBA isn't really my thing, however I have friends who play LoL and complain about the meta all the time.
---
Previous iterations of CS are not better than GO imo, Played them all and I'd put GO ahead of the others because its a lot more competitive. The people who love older iterations of CS love it because they could go into a server with 9 other randoms and just shit on the noob players. Which is weirdly the argument against world pvp on classic.
---
And they still get R1 vs other people doing the same thing...
---
74 runs saw it once and ofc didnt got it.
---
Last item i need our of 5 mans.
---
The Horde are so honor starved on Stalagg that they camp Ironforge bank and the Mage Tower in Stormwind. 
---
I’ve begun going through Darnassus for everything on my characters above level 48. They’re desperate for honor, and it’s just not available.
---
Stop being pedantic, if it’s 10,000 that is still significantly different from 3,000.
---
&gt; I hope people will realize this week that they got barely any honor and ranks and stop doing this shit.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Same with the flight point camping. I hope people stop doing it when they realize they have now honor to lose.
---
Or they will double down because they don't get how the system works. That I could imagine as well.
---
So stop getting farmed. Theres ways around it. Corpse walking a few times isn't a big deal. Go somewhere else.
---
Hey if it turns out being a great game then whats the problem? Win-win
---
Well I can echo that experience on Fairbanks
---
I have hit 60 some days ago, i'm 9/16 into my BIS farming and am wondering if i am ready to be taken into a raid?
---
I have no experience with raids in WoW but some from SW:TOR. Is it possible to make it work? How complex are the strats?
---
What consumables should i get? Is there something i am (A Mage) am expected to do other than prepare food and water?
---
I am afraid to not get good gear until the next phase drops. That brings me to the next question: What gear is actually for mages?
---
Going with my guild is not an option either, we are a small guild of friends and i am the only lv60 so far.
---
Sorry for so many noob questions. I am new to endgame content...
---
Then his friends need to step up and help him the fuck out
---
Gonna play both. Your point is moot.
---
It's a Wisp, night elf racial passive ability that gives +50% increased movement speed while dead.
---
No reason, it's just the only thing you can put in your ranged slot until phase 5.
---
Man I'd kill for 35/65 are you going by the wowhead census though? Because that shit is way off
---
its not even a week, and the vocal minority is screaming its longs out.  
---
Just give it a couple of more weeks and the huge Zerg raids are over.. they are not efficient anyway.
---
Spy is the only reason I've made it to lvl 53. When the buzzer buzzes I stealth or vanish. Then watch the horde ride past. Till the warlock sees me.
---
That doesn't make it sound any more exciting.
---
Good source of rogue info.  
---
https://shadowpanther.net/
---
I used to use this back in vanilla, glad it was brought back online.
---
i never said "all tryhard guilds have a bad time".  i was talking about this one guy and his experiences because it may be relevant to many people
---
I leveled a priest to 55 on heartseeker than just rerolled somewhere else.
---
I log into it from time to time. Last week i logged in to see how many people were in orgrimmar and found a full party of alliance just chilling in the inn. No one interested in grouping up to attack them. : /
---
Why did yall even roll on pvp realms
---
I do not have the source and don’t have the time to dig for it, so if someone else can do it it’s great, but Blizzard did say in a blue post that the restrictions for migrations would probably remain the same as in Vanilla.
---
Damn.. how many hours did you put in? I honestly believe I'm the slowest leveler. a couple weekends ago I put in a lot of time, way more than I should have, but only went from 51-54. I was pretty pumped about that at the time lol
---
This breaks casting bar addons.
---
They could limit combat log to 40 yards.
---
dont respond to it, and dont join there group.  
---
Also making a post on reddit doesn't change  thing, because all daily and weekly post about this topic hasnt changed a thing in game.  
---
Just accept and ignore it.
---
you are not alone in this line of thinking
---
Gnome mage is the alliance equivalent of undead rogue.
---
Spy will detect you ability or not.
---
How do you expect them to summon people if the entrance is camped?

---
Alliance had complete control of both plaguelands on Friday 🤷‍♂️
---
My brother was 58 this weekend it was a nightmare for him.
---
The best the solution we find was to group up and keep him safe while he grind, this allow us to make some HK and he was able to grind kinda normally.
---
When we are off or occupied he goes back to retail. 
---
Hope the situation settle a bit in few day
---
There isn't really any good alternative tho to not make it too common or easy to get
---
&gt;Instead of complaining about how you’re constantly camped in searing gorge, go to a different zone! 
---
On Fairbanks at least it literally doesn't matter what zone. It's all camped every farming spot, zone, w/e down to the last. Hell even IF/SW has 5-6 rogues in the portal rooms waiting for flagged people. 
---
You clearly haven't experienced it firsthand it's a lot lot worse than you think it is on some realma with the imbalance.
---
I never see these "deep groups" people keep talking about except at BRM or people waiting at instance entrances for their groups.
---
Whats the best vocation for mining, collecting herbs, fishing etc. Im thinking of pvps encounters while collecting at higher levels; mostly just to escape if ganked or something in that sense. Im guessing a rogue would perfect?
---
Medium might not be, but full servers certainly are.
---
You should be fine. Raid content is really easy right now and most bosses only have one or two mechanics to worry about. You might not be top dps but otherwise you are good to go.
---
spec reck/ret, group up with 4 others and roam around. Pala is great for group fights. Melees can't do shit in those huge fights anyway.
---
Phase 2 is non-content, so it can't be good or bad.
---
Hey, I read this comment on the quest on Wowhead:
---
\- Appears to become unavailable if Goblin Invaders has already been accepted/completed. I assume you can abandon Goblin Invaders if not completed to accept this quest. 
---
Really bummed out I missed the quest for this reason..
---
This is a shitpost, right?
---
There aren't zones that don't have roving deathsquads plural. How dense are you? 80/20 splits and worse means you can't go *anywhere*
---
I think we all know who that somebody is.
---
Salty fuckers haha. This video is MEME you dense fucks
---
Took me 9 days played but i only dinged 60 last week. Dont worry about it and dont compare yourself to others. In mmos there will always be someone better than you/better geared and there will always be people worse. The only real and good question to ask yourself is did you get a meaningful and fun experience out of it *for yourself*.
---
I love it at times, but the faction imbalance due to transfers is shit.
---
Ahh I remember the first time I did Heroic Firelands... dem spicey legs
---
It's happening all over again....
---
I love the bolt + chain lighting + instant cast of earth/frost shock in pvp but don't know anything from shaman. It is a nice class for a casual that likes pvp? What do u like in a shaman?
---
&gt; I feel pretty terrible about it lol
---
I feel you on this haha
---
Assuming you don't attack in which case the debuff is removed, and I've seen people wait out the 30 sec as well by just sapping/fearing/nova/whatever.
---
Respec to Holy-Prot, heal raids and pvp, tank 5-mans
---
I love druids, but personally dislike playing as a Tauren, I love tiger mounts and flips so why would i play horde?
---
RIP heartseeker horde
---
A fire demon or a boxer?
---
That's not extreme numbers
---
Don‘t tell him chat. He doesn’t know.
---
Op is gonna die regardless, hes flying into ungoro, the trex is gonna eat him
---
Exactly.
---
Griefing implies that one player is going out there way to stop you from playing in an enjoyable manner. All of the examples you listed can be avoided or resolved easily, dungeons being camped? Corpse run, use another enterance. Graveyard camp? There are other graveyards those are two examples.
---
Thats not true, i wouldnt corpse camp you if i didnt care about you being a player with emotions.
---
What is a looser? And how does rank 4 correlate to that?
---
No because in those 20 seconds I'll mount up and leave. Have fun in your Bush
---
One of the most stupid comments EVER
---
Sub ambush spec is great for leveling (slightly worse than combat on average, better than combat vs "clothies" mobs), but much better for pvp. Go for it
---
I might be idk. Just sharing ly own experience.
---
Anyone who knew anything about Classic knew what to expect. Not Vanilla but actual Classic in the current gaming climate. Private servers were the same and there was a new private server released just before classic launch (Northdale) and it was the same there. People LOVE PvP. On Private servers we didn't even get the option to play a PvE realm you just had to put up with PvP and get on with it. You have the option to avoid PvP if you hate how it makes the game so I have no sympathy for people who chose to play PvP and are now complaining about it.
---
BTW, Dungeon Levelling is actually viable and anyone complaining about being camped while questing by level 60's should probably start farming their pre-raid bis.
---
I'm a level 50 Holy paladin (went holy the whole way) on Horde-dominated TenStorms EU and I must say, I can't comprehend why anyone would wish to play any other spec on a paladin. Warriors have sweeping strikes, whirlwind, mortal strike, and execute; three instant attacks and double strikes against multiple opponents. 
---
Paladins get... auto attacks. And some chance damage procs on those auto attacks. Add to that that we get no slows and no meaningful gap closer and you have a completely ineffectual offense.  
---
It's objectively stupid to try and make ret work, when in any group pvp situation, you will be 100% more useful as a healer and support. Just cast  Freedom on a warrior, assist with a well-timed 5-second stun and bubble if you get too much heat. Cleanse and heal when needed.
---
I know everyone says seal fate builds aren't exactly viable until later in classic, but I've always found the build way more fun than combat daggers. What % base crit would be a good time to switch? 
---
Also, I wont have 5/5 imp daggers with the seal fate build I was thinking of using
---
breh thats literally the way the game was designed, hunters get to track, druids get to use their animal instinct to track as well. if you want to have the advantage of seeing people on the minimap then play one.
---
Oh yeah how would you go about it? Instead of complaining about it lol.
---
in world pvp they dont, everyone has a fair chance.
---
&gt; i'm 9/16 into my BIS farming
---
congrats, you're already overqualified
---
&gt; How complex are the strats?
---
the strats are as complex as 'keep distance if you're ranged' 'focus this guy first' 'use decurse on this fight' 'don't stand in the fire'
---
&gt; What consumables should i get?
---
2 (greater) fire protection pots for every Ragnaros try is nice to have
---
&gt; What gear is actually for mages?
---
anything with spell damage, spell hit or spell crit
---
Yeah we're not touching grays, because the less we kill them, the faster they level up = more honor for us.
---
That's fine, you're then no longer in the area I'm in, you've stopped what you're doing and I'm free to do whatever. Silly argument really but sure.
---
Uhm, no. Ret paladins were actually changed before release. In the beta they had a lot of different placeholder spells.
---
Who could have predicted this? :o
---
Name checks out. You knew the poster was joking and you are joking too they just dont get it because its meta level.
---
What have you contributed lately?
---
I don't get how you can be left behind in Classic. No raid content become irrelevant like it does on retail. Even if your guild is raiding Naxx, you're still going to be clearing all the earlier raids like MC every week.
---
"ça mérite des patates comme un poto qui veut ta femme"
---
The problem I have is 99% of my playtime is spent without a healthstone in my inventory, so it's hard to remember that I have one when I do.
---
Horde bad, Nintendo good... wait..
---
I have 4 characters at 42, yes all 42. Why 42? i dont fucking know.
---
Anyway, War, Shaman, Druid, and Hunter. 
---
Warrior does the best group damage, 30-45, can tank so its easy to find groups, but lacks pvp and solo before 30 is painful as fuck.
---
Shaman does a little of everything, so much utility, good in pvp, good in groups, good solo. It is by far my favorite.
---
Druid is like a weaker shaman imo. People will disagree, but its like a jack of all trades too, but just does everything ALITTLE worse than shaman. (Except tanking, but I HAVE tanked SM cath and RFD as my shaman and its actually pretty damn good.)
---
Hunter Hes fun to play solo, and world pvp is easier on him, but its not enjoyable enough for me to main.
---
Still sound like they didn't have enough time to make it not bad
---
There is absolutely room for it. The second sentence of the post admits that there are valid points that are brought up that will solve some of the issues. If everyone thinks that lowering server populations is going to do anything more than spread out the amount of time between getting ganked, they’re lying to themselves. Even if we drop the server population these death groups will still exist. The only difference will be the amount of time between your deaths. It doesn’t solve the issue, it delays it.
---
&gt;gfp during traah
---
Surely not right?
---
Very true. Was demolished by a level 19 rogue as level 23-24 something (though he did open on me). Afterwards I checked the combat log and he obv used poison, but also had life steal enchants on his weapons and I noticed he had engineering goggles on, and after the fight bandaged to full health super fast (so likely maxed out first aid). Felt a bit better about losing then, lol.

---
I have a better idea, just allow free transfers from overpop realms, than you can go to a more suitable server that fits your needs instead of an overpopulated one.
---
leave the popular servers to people who like that, you can play on a less popular/desirable one with fewer people.
---
I think we are not on the same page, I have spy too so I can hide because of it..just because they have it doesn't mean they find me 100%.
---
I understand the plight of those trying to do the last few levels to 60. It’s rough. I try to not kill any non 60s unless they try to attack me first. I have been having fun doing the small scale kill teams 3-7 people. The big raids don’t give very good honor.
---
If you can't stand getting camped roll pve. Its the one thing that seperates them. You can't always pick your fights and people are assholes.
---
Imagine being it used in Bg's lol
---
It's not really how the game was designed. Playing originally I almost always had PvP matches be with people right around my level. Sometimes if a Horde was camping you, you could find someone 10 or so levels above you to come help. For a long time in vanilla it was hard to find 60s that wanted to just kill lowbies because most people were still leveling. Back then, very few people were worried about optimizing and there was no quest helper so the game was just slower.
---
I loved the PvP aspect back in vanilla because it gave a sense of realism to the game, wandering across some opposing faction. I've not been having a good time with PvP this time around because it seems to be dominated by sad trolls who don't mind spending entire days camping low level areas.
---
Found the horde player
---
Whyyyyyy?
---
Nethergarde Keep is already like 30 to 70 horde ally ratio.
---
Enjoy it all you want, but you can't expect anyone to believe you don't Life Tap in dungeons because Dark Pact, that is just spreading misinformation and someone who doesn't know any better might believe it.
---
Stop whining.
---
Eventually, Disney will buy Activision and THEN Ragnaros will be a Disney princess, just like the brood mother in Alien.
---
It's merely a scapegoat for worldpvp, and not any solution.
---
What good does it do to remove it? Does it make world pvp anymore fair, when it's already gank or be ganked?
---
The only solution is to make a low-level player kill a DK. Unless he or she engaged first. But that should have been implemented long time ago.
---
That's bs, it does not trigger on stealthed players, but it does notify if somebody around you activates stealth. It also doesn't say where they are, so usually it prompts humans to pop perception and mages to spam aoe.
---
And all the people bitching are on the losing side
---
Duh
---
I'm levelling a little slower. I switched focus from quests to dungeons and it's been pretty okay. Just takes 2-3x longer to get \*into\* the dungeon is all, specially if it's a Blackrock Mtn one
---
You can start by not making stealthed units show up in it.
---
while i dont agree with him - i dont think thats the way we play anymore 
---
its funny to see his point proven as you cant even comprehend the idea of going somewhere without needing something haha
---
man many times i used to just go into places blind - not that i would do that anymore - culture has changed
---
cikoon and people like him/her/it wont do anything to make their own situation better, they will complain and whine thinking someone else should fix it for them.
---
"outside cities to battle". Yeah sure. We're talking about alliance, picture 2 is people quit the game/server.
---
That was his whole point.
---
Or maybe you only see reddit nerds complaining about it on reddit.
---
Imagine fishing and suddenly looting something with this icon:  [https://i.imgur.com/MasD1Kw.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MasD1Kw.jpg)
---
I play on zandalari EU ally, server is pretty balanced. no trouble getting into lbrs/brd.
---
There are gank groups on every higher lvl zone, but they roam around,so once they kill you they move on and by the time i ress they're at the other end of the zone,or they got killed.
---
I'm having a blast,we did camp the horde FP in BS for half an hour with 3 people until we got overrun, at which point i joined an lbrs group and just walked up to the entrance, even passing some horde.
---
SS vs TM is just a game of chicken and probably the least fun to do, 2 big groups, 1 group rushes, other retreats,kill 4-5 players, then they do the same. sometimes with good coordination and having mages die on the retreat path and ress frostnova, or blink inside their raids , its fun. Only happened once tho in the hour i spend their people are to uncoordinated.
---
And i am still leveling my hunter wich is 38 atm, no real trouble there, i get killed more sure, but it's about the same as when i first played vanilla (honor was already out then)
---
And i play during the day/evening, not in the middle of the night.
---
So, I'm the one that does it everyday. Still need 2 pieces from a couple of dungeons that I'm quite unlucky mind you, I do this every day. I dark pact everday and my damage is always on top. Yet you, the one that doesn't do it calls me out for misinformation? How about you remove that dildo from up your ass and actually try something before you spout bs? K. cu
---
Enjoy your lesson when you hit 48. Just remember you have lots of options.
---
Moron, acting sanctimonious when you know nothing.
---
Counterplay-options: Grenade, Gnomish net, Gnomish cloaking device, Limited Invulnerability Potion, Voidwalker Sacrifice just to survive or being SL-spec
---
Not sure if Seduce counts as shadow, but if not, just seduce target until it wears off.
---
Other than that, if the rogue has shadow reflect up and uses it at the right time, it's not looking too good for the lock. Only last chance besides useables is winning the kick-mindgame.
---
I probably won't even play this week now... by the time the weekend hits I'll have like 75% rested or so, which will make 58 easy, then it feels pretty smooth sailing!
---
I have a lot more fun with world PvP after phase 2 released. It has distributed the PvP activity on my server quite well.
---
I merely looked at the stats on a website, I have no way of checking the actual numbers unless Blizzard wants to publish them.
---
Also because you were able to login without queue on a server while another one had queue doesn't mean you have proven without a doubt that the first one is less populated ...
---
I know people love their dramatic effects on Reddit, but " That's straight up lying" for something we don't have official numbers, only estimates, is a bit too much isn't it ?
---
It only lists items vendored in the past 2 weeks or so. If you want anything past that, you'd have to pester GMs because most will just say no.
---
Nah dog you just bad at the game
---
While I'm enjoying world pvp it's painfully obvious my opponents are not.
---
Wait, something is wrong here.
---
&gt;Horde has 10% more quests than alliance
---
Please provide sources for this factoid. 
---
Using Classic wowhead's quest database search function to browse quests per faction, 1-60, turns up 3012 [Alliance](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests/min-level:1/max-level:60/side:1) quests and  2778 [Horde](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests/min-level:1/max-level:60/side:2) quests. Wowhead is of course a third-party source, but to my knowledge one of the most extensive ones out there.
---
I play on a PVE server and it's actually refreshing seeing these zones explode with combat and having cities dangerous for once. I can understand why people are up in arms especially in regards to NPC killing, camping etc however the world pvp going on is very good makes zones like you said come alive and make the game better than afk in cities.
---
&gt;  Roaming deathballs 24/7 ganking non-stop we are outnumbered almost 7-3 and all horde do is hunt alliance.
---
And thanks to spy hiding is not an option anymore either.
---
I never said it applied to every buff, trueshot is indeed RAP as well
---
imagine playing on heartseeker KEK
---
blablabla, there were 3 dwarf rogues camping the boat from Ratchet to BBay all day Saturday.
---
I know when he went full-time lol, that's irrelevant to my question. He streamed for years before that, I'm pretty sure he wasn't popular from day one.
---
Sounds like someone who has been given a clear, direct solution to his problem but just doesn't want to do it.
---
i dont like rogues entire class mechanic or hunters class design is basically what your saying.... if you want everything the same and equal go back to retail lol
---
dont like rogues can stealth so use an addon to cheat it - funniest thing ive seen today jesus
---
They need to be within a minimum distance.
---
As I sais in another post, I totally agree. Reddit is as usual representative of casuals and whiners who can’t make a group of 5 people and have fun in small scale skirmishes. And I play ally on a high pop server so everything is possible if you just enjoy the game for 1mn
---
Why are people acting like world pvp just came out? I've been pvping in the world for months. Only difference is honor came out, so now people are honor farming. You do see the difference right?
---
Don’t be so sure about that. They could still remove it and then you’ll have to l2p without your cheat addon.
---

Can someone give me an updated link for the Paladin Discord? I'd like to see some guide and how to build my paladin from lvl 1 to 60
---
BGs will be rushed out. Its a chain reaction. They released this shit on a majority playerbase in the 50s and fresh 60s. These people were not ready for this and now want it gone. BGs will release to fix this. Had they waited longer people would be less frustrated.
---
And they really cant not release BGs at this point. They already set precedent pulling DM out early and phase two in a couple months.
---
If they stand at the south end of the cave where you enter, and you stand at the north end of the boss room, you can see each other on the minimap. So try to kill the boss on that side and they will be eligible.
---
To be fair, the quest text says the kobolds are an infestation, moving into the mines and murdering the miners there. Also, that they were likely sent there by the Defias to disrupt Stormwind’s economy.
---
Now you could get into a whole other “are we the baddies” conversation about the Defias, but considering those dead miners were prooooobably not the nobles they’re supposedly trying to fight against, I’d say no, we’re not the baddies in this case
---
The only way to think that wow is a pvp oriented game is to have never played any other mmo at all
---
Premade groups should just be queued with other premades that would solve the problem wouldn't it?
---
Why are people acting like world pvp just came out? I've been pvping in the world for months, and I've been having fun doing it. Only difference is honor came out, so now people are honor farming. You do see the difference right?
---
I definitely think some servers might be really bad just from how many people are complaining. I haven't had any issues that other people seem to be reporting though. Maybe it is because I'm on an rppvp server.
---
There's nothing wrong with wanting BiS, but it has affected every aspect of the game. No one wants to invite someone who might roll against them, so they just sit in LFG spamming the macro they made and ignore plenty of people who want to join. In the end, they spend more time looking for a group than actually accomplishing anything.
---
Personally, PvP before phase 2 was as I expected and as it has always been on all the private servers that I've played on and all the time I've spent on retail.
---
That is, most of the time people ignore each other, sometimes you get ganked totally unfairly like 2v1 or while you're on mobs, rarely you get killed by high level dudes who've got nothing else to do, and very rarely you get engaged in a fair fight.
---
Ofc phase 2 is something else completely, but before that ? It was fine.
---
Makes no sense why they couldnt wait a few more weeks when the majority playerbase was at the level/gear range where this system would abuse them the most
---
Sure, but at least there won't be a situation where you have 30% more of a faction online. I feel like it would be a sound solution at Least until BGs are implimented.
---
Pro tip: get an extra hobby or two that will give you some circles of new people to get to know. This is one of the easiest ways to find someone. If you are at home all the time not meeting new people, you’re going to struggle.

I am Horde on a PVP server that is 60-40 Horde and our world PVP situation has been awesome. Even though we outnumber the Alliance the actual numbers you see in world PVP are really even. I guess the Alliance on my server just tend be more active than the Horde in world PVP. I am also on a med pop server so things aren't over-crowded.
---
The alternatives do work. It drastically cuts down the amount of time you spend dead if you’re in an instance. Getting to an instance isn’t going to be easy. I never claimed it to be. But that’s still going to be a problem with whatever the amount of players on a server. These groups will still exist. It will die down though when this stops being the new and cool thing to do.
---
Why would this give an accurate representation of the server? It's early am. You did a 1 day 1 sample size 1 time trial. Expand your test results.
---
Of course it was early but the streamers must be pleased...... Remember, normal people are not priority for Actiblizz xD.
---
So whyd you do it?
---
What did you guys think World PvP was? 
---
Blizz should make 2 new realms where PvP is banned and give the complainers free transfers.
---
Druids. Druid forms break cc, and you can pop in to cat form to sprint/stealth away, or cheetah form to just run. Druid also has infinite water breathing with seal form, and can cc with entangling roots to help escape on land or drown people in water.
---
farming them DK
---
:d
---
There's really no reason you should be able to see enemy players that aren't even on your screen. Spy needs to go.
---
We did want this.
---
This isn’t an Academic paper, no citations are needed... If you want to prove/disprove what OP is saying do your own research.
---
Have you read anywhere players communicate? That’s all you see. Scroll down this reddit page and read the comments... Most people are frustrated where as a minority is saying “go back to retail!” Or “play on PVE server!”. Those two answers don’t deal with the overall frustrations a large number of the players are having.
---
starshard make leveling as a non-shadow priest VERY easy.
---
Listing spy add on as the second thing “ruining” phase 2 is hilarious. Just admit you don’t like classic pvp as much as you remember.
---
I do
---
Remember when neckbeards were bitching about only 1 Skeleton per player?
---
This looks way more terrifying than if it was only a handful of players leaving all those skeletons.
---
I am mage, new to the game on pvp server, and i think it's hella fun !! Im 60 already and love the thrill to be in constant danger ! Just chillin and see a whole raid running towards you... 
---
If you're tired of it you can spam dungeons, avoid high lvl zones or use engi stuff and pots (invis, fast move etc come in really handy!)
---
They don't all do though. My guild has all kinds of meme specs and nobody really cares. Maybe our progression will halt at some point, but at this point we're all having fun raiding each week in whatever roll people wanna play.
---
Its taken from addon which spams the who list and count people on both factions.
---
Its not entirely accurate, and it may or may not be updated recently. It doesn't say.
---
But even if the alliance were to have more lvl 60 characters, that doesn't change the ratio where there are literally 22,000 more horde characters on the server.
---
In that case i also want my barbershop. Would be a great christmass gift that has 0 impact on the spirit of vanilla
---
&gt;stack arcane power to deal lots of damage with arcane shot
---
Doing this will significantly increase how much damage you can do while continuously moving. 
---
If you can afford to stop moving for half a second at a time - which you can in almost all scenarios where your damage matters - you'll do far more damage by increasing your physical damage.
---
Yeah actually. This is one of the reasons I'm not getting that depressed over rerolling. Playing alliance this time and a warlock so I'm still getting the first time feeling. Playing druid was pretty boring tbh
---
People do realize, they are just too unskilled to participate in fair combat
---
lmao reddit downvotes you for not complaining
---
this sub is priceless
---
On a kind of related note, how would you feel had they, in the beginning, disallowed the making of a character for that faction if that faction severely overpopulated the other?
---
Issue is, there are far more people on each server than what there used to be back in the day.
---
So right!  Alliance have this strange racial where nomatter what the horde does, they're totally different in every way in spite of having the ability to do the exact same thing!!   Pretty sure you can successfully report an alliance for camping, whereas it's in the horde description!   
---
Also, you're an idiot.
---
So you are saying you plan racials specifically for leveling when you need it most end game?
---
Smart stuff.
---
Teach me more.
---
Not true, killing a lvl 1 at lvl 60 doesn’t do anything. DKs are related to some NPC’s civilians (mostly quest givers or any other kind of npc that have nothing to do with PvP). You’ll see ‘civilian’ in green if you hover your mouse on them.
---
Me too
---
A lot of things I see in the comments is people claiming that because they pay for this service they have the right to be critical. You do. It’s called your purchasing power. If you don’t like what is happening then take your purchasing power elsewhere.
---
&gt;That being said, if there weren't such large faction imbalances, it wouldn't be as bad as it is.
---
This depends entirely on your server. I'm on a very evenly balanced server when it comes to the two factions, and WPVP has been a blast so far.
---
The solution to the server imbalances is probably just to offer free transfers off those servers (maybe faction specific?) and also potentially faction-specific queues to further incentivize balance.
---
If you could state my problem and the solution provided I would be more than happy to oblige.
---
If you're a mage, there's a couple of addons you really should get for raiding - Decursive (makes decursing a lot easier, since one of your top priorities on some fights will be to remove curses from players) and BigWigs or DeadlyBossMods (DBM) for raid alerts and timers, to keep track of boss mechanics. The latter, especially, are must-haves - if you're used to decursing via your raid frames the former isn't mandatory, but most DPS don't do it by default in dungeons (based on pugs) so might be a good idea. 
---
Stocking up a few Greater Fire Protection Potions (GFPPs) is a good idea, you will want to pop one before the Ragnaros fight starts, at least, and keeping a few in stock is not a bad idea. Greater Arcane Elixir gives 35(?) spellpower I think, I'd keep a stack or two of those, as well as 10-20 Major Mana Potions in case your mana gems are on CD/insufficient and you can't spend time Evocating - doesn't hurt to keep them. Having a few Restorative Potions at hand will also make your (and your heals') life significantly easier on certain fights, Geddon specifically. Then there's a multitude of World buffs you can collect before the raid, if you really want to - some of these give +critical strike chance, which is quite useful. Everything you need to know about buffs should be covered in [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-consumables-list-for-each-class#world-buffs). Now, MC can be cleared with a minimum of consumables as long as people know what to do. 
---
However, if you are looking to join a group and the raid leader has to choose between 3 mages, all with kind of similar gear, but sees that one has several world buffs and packs a stock of consumables whereas the others haven't even bothered buffing up with Arcane Intellect, who would you as a raid leader invite? Keeping consumables and being willing to use them in order to make yourself more useful to the raid shows that you come prepared, and that you're willing to do your best. On the note of coming prepared, you can check out [this guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-raid-molten-core) which gives a basic idea of boss abilities to keep an eye out for in MC, and even has some class-specific tips (as on which fights Mages should be ready to decurse, what AoEs to look out for, etc etc). Read it through and keep it open in a tab so you can quickly check up things before the fight starts.
---
Good luck!
---
I got camped the other day in STV by a guy multiboxing 5 shamans. It's not fun getting shocked 5 times every 6 seconds lol
---
Eh, we have this one too: a warlock quest is to murder a SW noble who's trying to know what's happening at the local warlock congregation
---
no you didn't lol
---
Why not a PVE server then?
---
imagine thinking I sit on reddit 24/7 waiting for people to respond to my comments.
---
xD
---
It does, but it also requires you to find said person(s). It's not fool-proof as you make it out, and yes, still a scapegoat in my eyes.
---
Horde favouritism.
---
No thank you
---
It's not a bug. It's been like this forever.
---
lol ok
---
Total misinformation, and that's the root of the problem. Idk about leveling, but the endgame is actually alliance favored. In pce ally has a pretty obvious advantage and the horde recials for pcp everyone is getting on about are completely balaced out by dwarf priests and paladins who are both amazing in pvp. Prople just hopped on the 'everything in classic favors horde' bullshit fad and now they're completely outnumbered ob pvp servers. I have always played Horde and for me it was never a question, but now I almost regret not having rolled Alliance.
---
Dungeons can work, although slowly (unless you are a wanted class that gets quick invites aka be a tank).
---
ZF gets slower, but is still decent xp. Maraudon is right on your level, try to get full runs instead of just princess. ST is good up to lvl 54 or so where you can start BRD (even earlier, for the early parts like prison).
---
It isn't as fast as questing, but you can make progress.
---
picture 3 is just dragonfang EU
---
yes you can lmao
---
It's not gonna be as bad in a week or two I'll wager. Ofcourse it's a shitstorm rn. Probably mostly so because all everyone in this sub has been preaching is how after phase 2 every dungeon entrance and flightpoint will be camped and that everyone abige lvl 45 is gonna get ganked to no end. Everyone constantly reads that shit and what do you think is gonna be meta when phase 2 comes out?
---
Found the low pop realm player.
---
Maybe I roleplay a bit much but I dont see horde as people, I see them as rabid dogs that need to be out down. So I do just that.
---
Are all these people whining the same that dont stop/turn around when you attack them? LOL
---
I mean it's like buying CoD and complaining of ennemies killing you
---
first x is the slot, the second x is the name
---
and no only cheap shot and ss/hemo
---
&gt; Wake up! We are all being led into Shadowlands!
---
Mostly just you since everyone else quit retail wow in like 2009.
---
4set is absurdly good for druids
---
No thanks, this aint a advertisement place for streamers.
---
Stun evasioned rogues. Yours is magic not dodgeable and a stunned rogue is a dead rogue
---
Not necessarily! Remove slow fall to fall straight down then blink/use slow fall again before you hit the ground.
---
What? I have played for 15 years and never heard of this. Are you telling me that I have an ingame way of seeing when people enter my area, enter stealth etc.?
---
No he just never needs any since he isn't dying.
---
I'm on Gehennas sir, the biggest PvP realm (AFAIK) in EU.
---
A hardcore wow classic fan might not be the target. I had never played wow before classic came out and I'm fully enjoying it, but I'm not attached to it by nostalgia like a lot of other people. I'm intrigued by shadowlands and plan to look into it. I think I am more the target of this theory than a steadfast classic only believer.
---
Completely agree with this.  My hunter is lvl 60, has 5/8 T1, Rhok'delar and almost 3k gold from DM farming.  Like fuck am I about to reroll.  However, give me the opportunity to realm transfer and I might just do so.
---
Because I'm usually on a forum that doesn't allow edits.
---
Found the no guild instance cleaver
---
Same happened to me. Had to clear my add-on folder
---
Blizzard says this
---
Players from vanilla say this
---
Former rank 14 players say this
---
You don't seem fit for the internet.
---
No, you're dead-wrong bud. Pre-existing buffs &amp; auras are not visible on the combat log in the game, even with everything checked. This is should be obvious to you even if I didn't tell you; how else do you reckon people afk-flying over you on flight paths ping the spy? You can literally open your combat log and see that they don't show up.
---
Just like stealth classes break pvp for non-stealth? Found that ironic/cute.
---
Anyhow, you didn't need to make a new thread, there are plenty on this topic. Try and lurk a while on reddit before posting, learn how it works than, contribute
---
Funny and true.

---
Good, hope all the Alliance quit.
---
Joins a raid to attack an opposing faction town.. complains it wasn't fun.. ok then just don't do it again?
---
Love the dwarf booking it towards the portal
---
&gt;From the (limited) experience of the one Human Paladin I managed to level to 30-something back in the day it felt like there was a good number of very peachy quest lines and rewards, and the pally 2h mace just felt insane - but hey, that's not even the half-point of the game, no idea how it gets later on.
---
That's around at the level where I would say the good Alliance questing experience ends. Horde got a few quest hubs added later on (in example, the one in Hinterlands) which are really good for leveling. Alliance don't have an equivalent for that. In example, Feralas and Hinterlands are quite poor for Alliance, but fairly solid for Horde. Verigan's Fist is great, but unless carried, it can take 4-5 hours to get, including trips to Horde territory. That's a weapon for just one class. 
---
&gt;Just frustrating when people choose to roll a certain faction and then still complain on and on about every the-grass-is-greener-point they can conjure up.
---
Ask yourself, do you think it's a coincidence that Horde ended being the most played faction in both Retail and Classic? Everything adds up. 
---
&gt;Faction imbalance is a real problem though if it is too skewed, but I'm not sure how to solve it - maybe the faction-specific transfers are a step in the right direction, but what if people won't follow through on it or if/when the number of people who realistically can transfer starts running out?
---
The problem with faction balance is a complex one, therefore, it needs complex and well-planned solutions. Encouraging fencesitters to play Alliance instead of Horde (via faction-specific queues on release week) would have helped. However, Blizzard does not seem to consider faction balance a problem, considering the lack of solutions presented.
---
For me this is a touchy subject because of what I went through Legion as a mythic raider. Twice my guilds decided to swap to Horde because recruitment had really dried up. The fact that Blizzard is doing nothing about it makes me very salty. As you can see, not just me though, as there are many frustrated Alliance players in both versions of the game because of the same.
---
What other solutions are there? Classic is too static (due to limited changes) to do anything about it, but Retail? There are tons of options. But again, it started on the wrong footing. Look at male Night Elves of WC3, those buffed up awesome Druids of the Claw, the mysterious and fascinating Druids of the Talon, Illidan, Malfurion, pure awesomeness. Now look at male Night Elves in WoW. What in the world? 
---
Same with Dwarves. Their running animation is straight from a Disney movie. Of course people say that Alliance races are bland, because they became Disney races.
---
The problem isnt that its hillsbrad, it's literally every flight path and every farming spot for herbs etc.
---
I'm one of the people who wish they had rolled pve but by the time p2 has come out I'm already 60 and raiding with a nice bunch of people.
---
I imagine a lot of people are also in this boat.
---
This isnt a question, just a complaint. Ganking has been in the game from the beginning, sure, but it has never been this prelevant. People didnt do it while lvling or farming pre raid bis since it would have slowed them down. Now however people go out of their way to gank since they have incentive. Add in the faction imbalance and you can see, why people would be annoyed
---
Thanks mate. Hope you grow up one day! All the best.
---
I don't think bluzz would do that because I bet some players would feel pretty shitty if they really wanted to play a certain faction with their friends and were forced to play the other
---
\#no changes!
---
Is he assuming my skin color ? - How racist !  
---
imagine if i use the N word, it get you banned on streamer platforms.... fckn BS
---
I'm a blastershot launcher user working on my hunter's quest. Now I'm confused
---
With a felhunter and SL, priest is definitely not favored, especially until trinkets are available.
---
The entire azeroth feels like its at war, and im having an absolute blast. Its like its worldwar fucking 3. And im screaming my lungs out addying my own voice to the chaos. KILL THEM ALL! Let non survive! FOR DEATH, FOR HONOR, FOR... fuck sake i just got tripple penetrated by rogues again.
---
No but only fighting when you have the advantage of numbers and waiting till I'm half health to engage because you're a worthless cunt is a distinctly Horde trait.
---
&gt;But the fact of the matter is plenty of casuals rolled on pvp servers to pvp when it's actually fair.
---
I'm sorry but if you only want to pvp when it's "fair" you need to roll on a server where you can decide what's "fair" and toggle your pvp flag accordingly (aka a PvE server). 
---
Sometimes you get decide when it's time for someone on the opposite facrion to have a nice little walk and sometimes they get to decide when you will be taking that walk. That's how it is on pvp servers. 
---
I mean I legitametly just can't understand the mentality of rolling on a pvp server but only wanting to pvp when it's "fair". It sounds like you want to pvp in battlegrounds, not in the world.
---
I don't need to respec to win as a 40 man death ball, and I'm not trying to rank anyway
---
Want to play with your friends? Too bad, population limit.
---
Versus - free transfers so you can find a server for you and your friends where you don't get dumpstered. 
---
you're on the wrong server my guy - pretty easy to fix problem
---
Delete rogues from Classic and I'm good.
---
Nah, they don't really care. It's aminor PR boost to them, but otherwise majority of their income comes from microstransactions, which there aren't any in classic.
---
From a ganking perspective: I was a druid in classic. And we could do something like that and we did that often :)
---
I did a ping on the map where our target was cause I could "smell" other players and found them on my minimap :)  There is no big difference from that spy addon.
---
What is a problem that back then you needed to work together. Now every dwarf and his mother can pull that off.
---
I think the only people who have the right to complain are hunters and druids :)
---
All others should think twice that nothing would change for them if they would "ban" that addon. However they would do that.
---
I think analyzing the combat log is not a big thing...
---
And a good warrior can go HARD and not pull threat assuming your tank is doing his job properly. our dps warriors pull some insane deeps on single target fights like Garr and you just can't pull aggro from a well geared dual wield fury tank.
---
I was just posting this in response to the people saying "HAHA GUESS Y'ALL DIDN'T REALLY WANT WORLD PVP!" after honor came out.
---
Yeah but what dropped from him?
---
EotS is more of a pvp talent than PvE - it's no substitute for heal pushback from resto tree, but it looks like you're not going to have talents for that unless you ditch the 3% hit - which is a tough choice and comes down to priorities. I'd argue that Ancestral healing with its armor buff is more useful than full Totemic Mastery, too. Elemental Devastation is more of an Enhancement pickup IMO, since you won't be meleeing very much as Ele. Might pop those in Elemental Warding, Reverberation or EotS instead. 
---
Finally, it comes down to the level 60 talent choice; 30/0/21 or 31/0/20. NS gives obvious resto and ele utility, whereas EM gives a good DPS cooldown but no defensive/resto value.
---
AFter having done nothing but farming gold and consumables for 2 months due to the slow release of phases. All im doing now is pvping, because ive done all the other stuff for 2 months. Im sure im not the only one thinking like that.
---
Just leveling my mage, so far the fastest &amp; easiest class to get to level 12 lol
---
I imagine it keeps the same pace to 60?
---
Yeap...and he quit like 2 weeks after they fixed it rofl... Probably because he was getting trashed canned left and right being unable to roll dodge without an addon telling him to do it anymore.
---
Yeah I wouldnt trust his data... He has a calculated 60s of 190. If he had a calculator or a brain, he'd be able to do math and get 143. I think he's trying to sensationalize his test results
---
Yeah no lmao, rated bgs are an aoe dot shitfest no thank you. Cant see how it "forced" anything considering how ignored its been for years.
---
&gt; You should have knew what to expect when rolling on a PvP server [...]
---
I did expect something similar as I've experienced 15 years ago. What I got is vastly different. Both in scale as well as intensity.
---
all my friends joined a PVP server and idk everyone talks about PVP i figured it’d be good
---
&gt;  **all that was needed is restriction upon character creation** 
---
That idea is flawed and doesnt give you the desired outcome, and Blizzard knew it. thats why didnt used it.  
---
Yes Blizzard made the Realms just to big IMO, but people should have used the transfer when they've had the chance.
---
Yeah, fuck you too. I'm also level 12 and have only a few hours played in this realm, most of that time being spent in Goldshire talking to other players about their travels.
---
Using guides and comments from Thottbot over a decade ago has been one of the coolest parts of leveling in Classic. Feels like being a historian or something.
---
Horde spamming chillwind camp because the graveyard is so close to the flight path amthat they can lock down both the FP and keep corpses camped so alliance can’t res, plus enough of a trickle in people landing that they never have to leave because they get bored.
---
Outside of Tanaris, the city walls roamed with packs.
---
Dire Maul chokes so that alliance can’t corpse run past the chokes.
---
You have no clue what you are talking about in your original post, and the sanctimonious tone as though you did is insulting. Enjoy burning steppes, blasted lands, and everything between you and 60. /spit
---
which again was pushed by "whiners"
---
hearthstone is, and it’s a hell of a lot better than this spam fest
---
both of those things are easy to do for horde on an alliance boat
---
no one does that shit lol.
---
Well majority of players are already 60. A lot of people were starting to stop playing / only raid logging in anticipation of the PVP release.
---
Low level BG's back then gave no xp and were filled with unkillable twinks, that killed you in 3 seconds.
---
I can't level any of my alts or find anyone willing to run SM because of horde on my server. Already seeing way less people playing and all AH prices steadily rising. Horde are going to make everyone else stop playing. Ruining everyone's fun seems to be their fun.
---
I like world pvp, I dislike ganking when the person can't give a reasonable fight back. If you know you can easily beat a player without a shadow of a doubt, then you need to fight stronger players.
---
a) i am playing other things b) kindly explain why giving higher levels an impossible advantage over lower levels is a great idea for me because my mental capacity is so low that i don’t think game companies should make it easier for higher levels to destroy lower levels
---
You aren’t dual wield fury tanking Garr unless you’re banishing 6 adds.
---
No because if you don't see someone moving towards you, you wouldn't just randomly jump into stealth without Spy telling you that someone's around. If you think that's fair, then so is people "randomly" using stealth detection.
---
&gt; Honestly there is an easy solution if you hate WPvP - re-roll PvE server.
---
Of course, just invest a couple on months to re-roll on a PvE server. Easy peasy.
---
Tibia is still around
---
Hey look guys it's history repeating itself.    Seems everyone likes to pretend they love world PvP but seems only a few actually have the stones for it.   
---
Nope keeps bgs on schedule I wanna get as much of the large scale wpvp in before bgs kill it.    There's always a bunch of people.who hate and or regret it. Was the same back in vanilla and I am seeing many of.tje same arguments and the same arrogant "I .right and I refuse to budge" mindset these players bring with them that ultimately  turned vanilla into retail.
---
80% of the pvp population is horde. you know this is gonna get down voted lel.
---
Made me laugh.
---
Just try out PVE. I think you’ll like the game a lot more. PvP isn’t for everyone
---
bad players dont do that,
---
Yes, its not entirely accurate. It also shows created charactrs if you scroll down so you can see the lvl disparity.
---
I also don't know how often or when this was last updated.
---
War...war never changes.
---
Why do people roll on PvP servers and get pissed when PvP happens? I will never understand this mindset! 
---
I always play PvE because my time is limited and getting ganked by 12 year olds constantly is just not fun for me. But people who hate PvP STILL roll on those servers! WTF?
---
the PVE stuff is fine but the entire PVP experience in my and my friend’s experience is just plain awful. he’s level 50 something and i don’t think he’s had a fair fight either
---
all other pvp servers are the reverse of heartseeker. now you know alliances pain.
---
4 runs an hour just isnt actually possible.  A fast time from start to finish in DM is under 15 mins.  But then you need to get rid of Kromcrush, loot chest, sell and get buffs, run all the way out, reset and back in.  That adds 4-5 mins easy.  So realistically, 3 runs/hr is best case scenario.  
---
Then, in terms of gold, vendor trash sells for an average of ~20g + pots and books. So realistically, 30g per run x 3 runs = 90g.  
---
And all that assumes no wipes, no selling items and having to wait for people to get there, no random shit with pet pulls and having to res pet etc. Not to mention getting ganked 5 times on the way there at the moment!
---
Dont get me wrong, its a really good way to make money - I have almost 3k gold on my hunter main, and before DM I had like 350! But despite the fact that I have cleared it lots of times, I still only average about 70-80g/hr, which looks bad but isnt really, because all these estimates of 100g+ are overly optimistic in the real world.
---
Any suggestions for lvl 44 warlock?
---
Actually world pvp has been better than expected for me. Yes plenty of ganking. But also some good defence raids in undercity, breaking off to plaguelands.
---
[He's not talking about the guild APES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1THE-vyhk4A)
---
Warlock could have sent his pet .
---
maybe i will but my complaints about paying $15 a month and how grind-y the game are still stand lol, but thanks if i do i’ll definitely look into that
---
but its caster isn't the warlock
---
This is why I rolled a PvE server. People will tell you that you’re casual trash. But world PvP is just toxic and unfun. I love PvP, but getting camped by roaming tank squad^TM is just annoying. I’ll wait for BGs.
---
So you are surprised that a 15 year old game is vastly different in current gaming climate than it was 15 years ago?

I dont doubt it.

 &gt; You'll be surprised how quickly players will switch when one side has instant pops and the other side has a 2 hour queue.
---
Spoken like someone who didn't play wow the first time around.
---
Him that kind of orc.
---
PvP happening on a PvP server? Damn who could have seen that coming huh?  /s
---
so... anything not engineer related?
---
Make sure your UI is set up so you can easily see when anyone in the raid is cursed, decursing is a big deal on trash and bosses in MC. You won't sheep much. If you really want to know about MC you can pm me and I'll tell you more things.
---
Bosses in raids count as level 63, which means you have a 17% chance to miss them. Talents will get you 6%, and you always have a 1% chance to miss, so you need to try to get 10% on gear. Hit is your best DPS stat until you have 10%. Just try to find the hit pieces you can with the most spell power/int/crit.
---
Raids in vanilla are sort of different than retail wow and swtor. Tier 1, which is MC and Onyxia, is ALL of the easy fights for the whole expac. When BWL comes out, that raid will have ALL of the medium level fights. AQ40 and Naxx have all the hardest fights. So right now only the easiest fights are released. Don't feel like you're falling behind, just go to some pugs and try to get some epics before the next raid comes out, no rush.
---
For consumables, you want to have enough arcane elixir/greater arcane elixir to last the whole raid. Get some food that gives a mana regen buff. Get enchants, cheap or best, on your BiS gear.
---
Head north from there. Just keep running straight up the road from the troll village. You’ll pass through Razor Hill, which is an orc village. Then you’ll run through a canyon, and beyond that is Orgrimmar, the capital city for the Horde. There should be tons of people there, of all different levels.

Spy addon should be eradicated. It should be recognised as staright up cheat
---
I did read it.
---
You rolled ally on a server that already has at least twice as many allies as horde.
---
There will still be people farming stuff. There will still be people running to dungeons. There will still be people helping guild mates.
---
What wont be a present as it is right now are the large Scale battles that take place right now but there doesnt seem to be in your interest anyways because in that scenario Spy is completly irrelevent
---
Yes, you are literally the only one.

But you don't know if it's 10,000? Then why are people stating it like it's insanely different? How about you get some actual numbers instead of just rambling about what it possibly is?

**Horde | Primary Goal \[PVE\] | Casual RP | WPvP and BG | Casual Friendly**
---
Throm'ka! How would you like to be surrounded by people that want to enhance each others experience and truly feel like a community of brothers and sisters? We believe in providing the best social experience possible, RPing, and experiencing content with people you can trust, rely upon, and of course have fun with. Our primary goals are PvE content in general with Raiding being our main goal, however we see this RP-PVP as a fine wine or whiskey of wow servers and want to experience everything it has to offer. If you are looking for a solid group who enjoy the journey, while enjoying the RP aspect, then this place can be your home.
---
Our group has been together since the server has launched and have had an opportunity to play together over the last few months. If you're looking for the top raiding or PVP guild you may want to look elsewhere but if you want a good group of people to experience all aspects of the game at your own pace come give us a look! We're looking for any class/builds and aren't looking to force you into respeccing for any content! New players? Veterans? It doesn't matter we're just looking for people who want to have a good time and enjoy the game.
---
Interested in learning more or have any questions please come to our discord to chat. [https://discord.gg/ZpNBMF](https://discord.gg/ZpNBMF) or message **Venthar**\#5732 (Venthar in game) or **Dano\_Banano**\#4370 (Grobnar/Vaelice in game)
---
&gt; Why aren't people happy?
---
This is a game-related sub. Happy does not exist.
---
We didn't have Spy in the real pre-TBC era, or as many players on a server, but I'm digging WPvP too. Spy is available to everyone after all. Seems like the same hot spots are hot then as now. Everyone remembers Hillsbrad and BRM, but Un'goro, Felwood, Azshara - all great then and now for honor. Some servers were imbalanced faction population then too.
---
That said the real honor comes from BG win spam and with the advent of the honor system I'm surprised how much I want them.
---
Night elf priest is fking amazing. Just Psychic scream, run in the opposite direction until they're out of view distance and shadowmeld.
---
wait, im confused. Are they roaming or camping?
---
Questing is also easier and more expansive on horde than alliance.
---
You think you want Classic.... but you don’t 🤔
---
... You have 2 tanks for Garr, 1 to pull the adds to the wall and 1 to tank Garr. You kill Garr first then AoE down the adds.
---
You absolutely should be dual wield tanking garr.
---
Outland is Draenor.
---
ok
---
Best i can do is 14hks per week
---
good. please quit so that the factions are a factions more balNced
---
Lmao, I don't think you still get it yet : 
---
&gt;This goes for every less favored factions of each servers, not specificaly horde and alliance. Servers are so imbalanced that the less favored side wont be able to camp as much as the favored side AND will be camped more. 
---
Which is happening under your eyes right now. 
---
&gt;Also, you're an idiot.
---
Therefore, no u
---
From personal experience as a dps warrior, raids arent complex at all. Wowhead is really useful here: just by taking a brief look at the guides should be enough. Mages have it easy: your only job is to spam frostbolt and maybe help druids decursimg in a couple fights. 
---
Consumables wise, it depends on how rich you are. Fire protection pots are a must have, everything else is optional.
---
I'm not familiar with mages bis, but wowhead can problably help you out.
---
As far as getting into raids goes, finding a pug shouldnt be too difficult, the only talkinng point would be loot distribution.
---
Arms is the way to go from levelling 1-60 and tanking 5 man dungeons. You should go prot when you start raiding.
---
How's your overall gear?
---
The people who 2man this (based on what I've seen) have good gear, pre-raid BiS with some MC pieces mixed in at least - and for the warrior that goes double, should be plate DPS gear with some mitigation gear if needed, and be ready to pop consumables or food buffs as needed. The people I know who 2man the healer is actually healing specced, although those extra dots can help with killspeed - but I'm sure this particular dungeon grind would be easier if you were Horde, just for the added DPS from WF totem coupled with strong healing and on-demand interrupts and Grounding (in particular) for Satyr boss. 
---
Also, most people who are not geared to their teeth do this 3-man. That would be your best bet unless you're well geared, or see if you can find another healer (resto druid maybe) and give that a spin just to see if it makes a difference. I healed a DW fury warr with Devilsaur and those leather shoulders and it turned into a pretty spammy fight toward the end as the debuff stacked higher. Your priest might be able to dispel that, though?
---
He's lvl53, he won't have any problems in Ungoro.
---
Warlocks can do 70-100 gph by soloing DME, hard to learn though and depends on rng (arcane crystal drops)
---
No one minds PvP, they mind getting 40v1d
---
no way they would bother with that while boosts are a thing.
---
the population cap is the issue. Server should have been capped to way lower pop. THe vanilla world is just not made for the amount of players there is rn.
---
Sounds like wishful thinking
---
95% of these posts are coming from people that have been playing the same way for the past two months and didn't adapt their game play whatsoever.
---
Some quests are harder than others right now, sure. Most quests are still quite doable though.
---
A lot of these people complaining are making themselves easy prey. Pull your mobs to a corner don't stay next to roads or a popular mining spot. Do something other than standing in the middle of a highly contested area.
---
This is really apparent in places like the yeti cave outside Everlook in Winterspring. Most of the alliance knowing full well what's going on will still just kill the yetis on the outskirts of the cave. Easy prey for literally anyone leaving everlook and heading south. Some of the alliance are smarter though and either fight or corpse run deep into the cave to quest. Your chances of being ganked drop massively when you have positioned yourself in a way that requires attackers to clear 10-15 mobs before getting to you.
---
You're marginalizing this. The pseudo-cheat part is the fact that you can freaking *click* on a name and auto-target some rando that used a skill near you. This is where the addon cross the line of "just parsing the combat log".
---
Sure, I can see that BigDickXXX used stealth near me oldschool, then quickly open the macro pane and write a /tar BigDickXXX macro, and get the same functionality.
---
Or I can have an audible DING DING DING lookout with an easy-list of things to click on that make this ridiculous.
---
I know there are a lot of people like me that wanted to feel the oldschool classic feeling again, old memories etc...but we have to accept that this is history.
---
Wow classic is an entirely new game today because of how the playerbase/mindset has changed. Still having a lot of fun though.
---
Rp-pvp here
---
No problems either
---
WoW is a casual Everquest clone, PvP wasn't even in the game until relatively late in development and it only got added because people demanded it. It was always going to be a PvE game first. To say otherwise is just straight up deluding yourself.
---
they can be effected by an aura/aspect/totem. Say a rogue enters spy range - does nothing but n moving towards you enters an aura or leaves one. This creates a combat log event and thus creating a spy notification. Same with buffs dropping off or buffs being applied by other people.
---
Ah yes. And Alliance *never* do this... People suck on both sides. Why tf do you and others always act like it’s only the other faction to blame for ganking, and camping, and steamrolling solo players with full raids.
---
Ah yes, the standard new-meta play for rogues:
---
* Find a target with Spy
---
* Run away from them to get enough distance to break Spy's range
---
* Go into Stealth
---
* Sneak up to them for 5 minutes
---
* Watch them mount up and leave the area before you even get close to them because they finished their quest/farm already
---
* Cry some more that you can no longer use terrain nearby to hide your presence and stealth closer without having them on high alert.
---
It's slow but it doesn't really matter as long as your having a good time
---
Week 1 before you know realm stats came out so clearly you didn’t read it
---
As a fellow huntard I fully support this, it's about time we start claiming caster and healing gear, fulfill the prophecy!  All gear is Hunter gear!
---
You're delusional.
---
Bullshit. I played in Vanilla and no one I knew on my server had an addon like this. 
---
It’s not supposed to be this easy to detect enemy players. You know it’s not. If you think it’s a “classic experience”, I suggest going back to retail. Because this has nothing to do with classic.
---
Same, reddit loves to bitch, and this sub is clearly full of people who didn't know what they wanted
---
Alliance are just as big of assholes. Last night an alliance priest and mage were camping northern stv on my server. They weren't doing the normal "well kill people 30 levels lower than us" thing. They were doing the "we'll MC people 30 levels lower than us so we can run them into too many mobs, so they die and take durability loss" thing.
---
There were also the other 3 alliance 51+ that were camping nesngiwary.
---
I mean, I understand that some people play wow for the power fantasy aspect. They want to feel powerful.  Maybe they are shit players and this is what they need to do to feel powerful.
---
Just saw this message now, but over the weekend I was running it with 2 other rogues and just stealthing to boss and reset and repeat.
---
Too late. By the end of next week I'd bet theres a 30% loss in Alliance players. Horde have killed Classic. Good job guys.
---
At that time of day yes, but in the overall of server population I don't know.
---
Not sure you can. I mean, long enough for an arena but,
---
I mean it really seems like your just upset that people don't agree with you arbitrarily deciding what's best for the game and players.
---
retail raids &gt; classic raids
---
I jumped onto my lvl 52 warri after I got ganked on my 60 warlock to join some people in hillsbrad ... was the must fun I had in along time - sure I died - alot- but still I managed to be part of few kills and it was a back and forth - an ongoing battle .. 
---
I just think its about perspective - sadly most people are already out there with pitchforks expressing their anger here on reddit
---
Paranoia add-on?  Also enemy frames, but i really don't know when it released on pservers or on actually vanilla
---
im the same Filthy casual here.
---
yesterday got FP to desolace and tried to run to Camp mojache had to run past THREE separate ally ambush groups along the oath near to dire maul, only died once somehow.
---
was awesome. we finally have a living and breathing world for the first time in years and the scrubs just want o cry... L2P or L2Quit
---
FTH
---
And it's right next to the mayor's place while alliance's is in some barn thing in the back. Clear horde favortisim!
---
i never said i wanted classic lol this is my first WOW experience and i am not the biggest fan of it
---
Undead male rogue*
---
My experience has always been that the undead female rogues are faaaaaar less of cunts than the male counterparts.
---
Found the guy that spends his whole day looking at a character he doesn't even like just to have advantages while lacking skill.
---
The most amazing part is the cocky appearance of people like that. Why would somebody act like the most intelligent person on earth just because he read one tryharding guide?
---
So you're saying I can actively make the gangkers life more difficult by not participating in PvP?
---
Interesting...

This kind of repetetive bot is super easy to catch and ban. They just have to do it.

I'll share with you the best thing you can find regarding classic warrior macros!  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl85ma/warrior\_stance\_dance\_complete\_macro\_suite/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl85ma/warrior_stance_dance_complete_macro_suite/)   
---
Get evrything macroed and have fun :D! props to the guy that made the post im linking.
---
Just FYI, if you go stealth out of combatlog range the Spy addon doesnt detect you, nor does it tell people where you are moving after the detection. Ppl pretend like Spy is some kind of 'Flare'-addon that breaks stealth, but all it does is warn you if a rogue goes into stealth.
---
It’s ok. I don’t need Internet points to validate my place on this earth.
---
no, that just shows the dots below the target frame, not on top of the nameplate
---
Exactly. There's no substance to the editing. Over-the-top would be way better than thiw soggy middleground where the plays are bad and the memes are unoriginal and ill-fitting.
---
my commentary on a particular facet of this that i'm not sure anyone has brought up:
---
a lot of people came to classic and rolled on pvp servers thinking world pvp would be fun, having some romanticized idea of it based on either 10-years-prior personal experience, youtube videos, maybe they did the 10-year anniversary 40v40 battleground, maybe they like warmode, whatever
---
a lot of those people feel short changed by the experience they're getting in classic, as if this isn't quite how it was supposed to be, and they're looking for someone to blame i guess
---
things we have in classic right now that make it different from retail warmode:
---
* much smaller playable world  
---
* many more people in it  
---
* no flying  
---
* rank-based honor system  
---
* very little endgame content/anything else for 60s to do  
---
i played alliance in vanilla on a slightly horde-favored high pop server. it was cancer to level, but once i did, i felt like i'd accomplished something. levelling on a high pop pvp server in classic is very different from levelling in warmode on live - pvp encounters happen regularly, several times an hour if you're lucky/unlucky enough, and they'll often be against people higher level than you or people not alone. it happens. you learn to deal with it. you process the emotions and you move on. corpse camping is a thing that sometimes happens, but there's a strong chance that if you're not max level yet, it's not personal, they're just doing it because they're dicks. even if you are max level, they're probably just regular camping and it's not your fault in particular. etc etc etc
---
i have the fortune of being on a relatively balanced server (earthfury) for classic and so far my experience largely mirrors what i saw in vanilla. world pvp happens often in classic. world pvp was never promised to be fair or fun, because it usually only is for one side of the transaction. that doesn't mean that participating in an open world faction war isn't satisfying on its own
---
so if you have to find somebody to blame for how little fun you're having, i'd say blame the people who hyped up classic world pvp and didn't explain that it's really only winning that's fun, but being a part of it has a magic all its own, fun or not
---
Does 1-2 days mean 24-48 hours of grinding?
---
On my server personally, 4100 players have shown up in a warcraftlog as having killed onyxia. Thata gotta be half the population of 60s or so.
---
That’s amazing. Your warrior kept pulls within range of totems. I had no idea they knew how to do this.
---
Reading some of your other posts I see you play on a PVE server. Let me explain it better... if you're Alliance then you will be farmed pretty much any high level area you go. It's not healthy pvp and 'exciting', it's really annoying being killed repeatedly wherever you go by multiple horde. Sure, in the end you can get where you need to go, but it quickly becomes very tedious and people will just either switch server (thus killing all pvp) or just stop playing. It's not fun doing repeated corpse runs, a lot of people don't have the time (have jobs / family etc). If you're so confident then re-roll Alliance on a PVP server and then report back.
---
I actually took a 5% int buff to play a char I like more.
---
Still.. racials aren't pointless typically.. starshards is. 🤡
---
&gt; Classic TBC are too much effort 
---
Lol what
---
It's probably the easiest money they're going to make in the next few years
---
&gt;What would be cool as hell is if Horde side took in a ass-ton of refugees
---
If HORDE SIDE took in MORE refugees, thereby INCREASING HORDE numbers resulting in a HIGHER percentage of HORDE,  a LOWER percentage relative of ALLIANCE and GREATER FACTION BALANCE.
---
The 'not allowed' thing was more collusion with the opposite faction on a pvp is against TOS. Since you'd need to well, collude to set that up.
---
&gt; You can still go in a dungeon and have good exp/hour-gold/hour with 0 chance of being ganked.
---
&gt;You can go fishing to make money
---
&gt;You can roll an Alt
---
&gt;You can help lower level of your guild in dungeons or questing zones.
---
&gt;You can solo farm instances for the Major City Rep Grind
---
&gt;You can participate in World PVP yourself
---
&gt;You can learn to play the auction house to make money while chatting with guildies + watching a movie or playing another game on the side
---
&gt;You can go back to previous zone and try to 100% the quest for shit and what not.
---
All these points are naught when all you want to do is level your main. Surely you must know this feeling.
---
Anyone regretting it is pretty small minded and reactionary. This is temporary and will die down once BGs come out which are likely to be sooner rather than later.
---
level up noob
---
So why not go to a pve realm of you don't like forced PvP that's unfun? 
---
That's half the fun of a PvP server
---
It's almost as if we're doing this for fun?
---
Tell that to the rogue who was higher level than me, waited for me to drink when I was under 40% health, then proceeded to get his ass whipped bc he was trash. Your logic is based on your bias. Both sides do it; people do it to me, and I do it to ppl all the time bc I imagine they baby rage like you are.
---
Hey me too
---
I play horde, it's game-wide unfortunately.
---
The euphoria of classic haven't even started yet imo. BG's (namely AV), BWL and ZG are on the horizon, prime eras of vanilla.
---
The issues of ph2 are shadows of classic's messy release, BG's will neutralize a lot of it.
---
I haven't used this add-on, and have barely been able to get on since Phase 2 began last week, and i already hate this thing. All i hear is bad things about this add-on. KILL IT
---
But 40v40 is still fair combat
---
No warrior tank will be paying for this on his own.
---
Each death be taxing.   Brutality is not just in her fight but the recovery as well.
---
Wait til you hit level 48, it will be a whole different game.
---
Well right now the two are basically the same. World PvP = Honor Farming.
---
It doesn't matter where I go, any region where there is something meaningful for me to do at level 60 I will run into a group or raid. This group or raid will kill me on sight and then attempt to kill me another 2-3 times when I res.  
---
I know it will probably calm down in a few weeks. But if it doesn't calm down I'm probably going to just log off till BGs get released. This game doesn't feel that fun right now, I feel as though I'm being forced underground into BRM just to be able to do *something*.
---
Does this mean I should have rolled on PvE? Absolutely, and I regret being on a PvP server most evenings now. But to be honest I didn't expect it to be this bad.
---
That makes no sense to me because you can mount in UC, for example. Where you can mount up is stupidly inconsistent. (There is at least one cave passage that doesn’t dismount you but most do.)
---
#NoChanges. At least if they’re QoL.

Some people just use the internet to distract from how much of a loser they are. Ignore them and keep going.

If the phases are any close to original vanilla, it'll only become an off-hand when naxx is released.
---
I know right?
---
Who cares.
---
The first few days my guild all split up in 5man grps thinking itd be better honor. But the retardmob known as "the horde" decided to run around in 40man raids... ANd its not only ruining it for us, they are ruining uít for themselves too. With the diminishing on hks they very soon get litterary 0 honor from their kills. But is suspect they are too stupid to realize this. Anyhow now we run around in a big raid aswell and its so fkn bad honor... We are swapping zone every 30min or so to not get hit too hard by diminishing returns...
---
Why does the horde come of as the intelectual equivalent of rabid dogs?
---
In the time its going to take you to wait for blizzard to add in paid character transfers you could make an alt on a different server and get it to 60.
---
Feeling the reality of the grind yet? lol
---
A real hero, sitting before me, in all the internet glory.
---
Just quit bro. So we alliance could play and not quit
---
Any competent guild that has cleared all content
---
You knew what classic was gonna be ahead of time, why did you roll on PvP if you hate it? I don't understand.
---
Have you listened to anything I've said?  The issue is over population, not the honor system.  Adding bgs will only mask the issue.  When it takes 30+ minutes for a queue to pop, people will be doing the exact same behavior.
---
I am aware that pvp exploded.  And that the honor system is primarily responsible.  It is naive to think it is solely because of that system that the world is more hostile.
---
&gt; No matter what you do in the game right now, it feels shitty, unless you enjoy being an asshole
---
Simply not true, but if it bothers you so much then yeah it probably would make sense if you just played on a nice single player (pve) server.  I mean what could be better than all the enemy players just basically being NPCs?
---
11 days for a new player is very impressive honestly dude! Awesome!!!

How does selling an item when running solo dungeons work? I'm seeing hunters selling tribute chests. Me, as a warlock, i'm farming DM N, if the bracers drop, can I just not loot em and invite someone and he's eligible to loot em?
---
Once you hit 60 and get a decent set of pvp plate you can swap to a 2h to murder clothies with and still have over 5k armor, then just go back to 1h+shield to frustrate rogues and warriors as a healer with ~60% phys mitigation. Pretty decent shadow res on banana gear too so you can resist fears a lot. Priests just melt with a decent slow 2h Judgement of SoR and DF+Shock. Really makes you feel as if you've demonstrated healer supremacy lol
---
Sums it up for me.  I rolled PvE on Friday night and had a blast this weekend.
---
There are classes without mana, and funnily enough those are the same classes who are melee and take the majority of damage.
---
Yea, I read all of that. I promise. Horde are going to cause all alliance on PVP servers to cancel their subs minus the few on servers not burdened with you cunts.
---
37 people tasted the flame of sulfuron and didnt like it apparently!
---
Ignore the idiots saying you got it ''late'' lol they're blind tryhard fools
---
This addon is terrible and shouldn't work. But I use it because everyone else does.
---
I am not even sure what kind of vital addons would break if you removed the specific logs that make Spy possible, whatever an enemy player is doing shouldn't be broadcasted to everyone, we can play just fine by looking at them and seeing their animations.
---
Private server strat for when you can kill Garr in 15-20 seconds.
---
Respec into a real spec.
---
Nah content is almost over... Many quit after raiding just a little bit.
---
No you're breathtaking
---
If you are expecting RP-PvP servers to be "PvP lite" with less ganking or griefing, you will be disappointed. They're basically just regular PvP servers, their RP communities are less than 10% of the populaiton.
---
If you are looking for a friendlier experience... don't roll on a PvP server.
---
Argent Dawn - once you have Revered reputation and have turned in all the stones you had saved up, what is the best way to get to Exalted?

Bc it’s entirely pointless

The whole point of an ah char is so you can just log in there and immediately use the ah

Walking around in the world aside maybe from farming fishes would defeat the point
---
Look at the /lookingforgroup channels. What is the majority of demands for groups are they looking for Scholo, Strat UBRS runs. If the majority is end game dungeons or raids and not mid tier dungeons like SM. Then i believe that the majority of people are in that level range.
---
this. im on a fairly balanced pvp server and its actually the alliance that are chimping out and taking control of everything most of the time
---
So what you're saying is on 15% of servers, the alliance are assholes
---
Ganking doesn't give DK's, first of all, second, most people don't care enough about letting lowbies of the opposing faction level to check the number before attacking.
---
Hydro is the hardest boss. If you struggle with him, just skip him. War+Pri is indeed the best setup for jump runs. It takes some practice, but it is definitely worth it, especially if one of you has Mining.
---
You think you do, but you don't. Many didn't.
---
It’s not. Try it out Dumbass.
---
&gt; Once the Alliance are gone then will the Horde still want to play?
---
I'm shocked if that's the average mindset of whiners on a PvP server. "Oh no, somebody wants to kill me, I'll switch server". Congratz you missed he point.
---
So you're happy about playing the game on easy mode, cool

&gt; Was he casting Arcane Missiles or something?

Don't be hating on my Arcane Missile mage now bro.

Mob grinding works but if memory serves you can start some quest in Red Ridge before heading back to Westfall for the Deadmines quests. :)
---
The solution is probably to quest in more than one zone at the same time. Believe me, there are enough quests to go from 1 to 60 without ever lacking quests, but it will sometimes require zone jumping.

gz
---
Honestly, yes, I did.
---
It was fine before phase 2 but the game is literally unplayable right now. I can't quest, can't mob grind, I can't even get to any dungeons.
---
I seriously regret listening to all the people who told me that "PvP is the way WoW was meant to be played"
---
You do not get DK for killing low level players. Only NPCs.
---
Ikr? 👍
---
Why do people go PvP who hate PvP? Human beings are weird as fuck I swear.
---
I love how a lot of people in here suddenly become trend analysts and say they can predict what the playerbase is going to develop if blizzard doesn't do this or that.
---
Just because you are unhappy and think about quitting the game it doesn't mean that everybody thinks this way. Maybe more players quit this game after a lot of people leave pvp servers, who knows? Blizzard got the data and they will do what is best for the game
---
Tbh there has been a lot of whining in this post. Just look at OP whining about people who don't agree with them.

Wasn't that always going to happen though? Faction imbalance is still a thing on live. Not sure how a lot of people didnt see this coming with less than 20 servers ready at launch. On top of that they could handle a lot more players than the vanilla servers could back in the day.  Is there a server that has close to 50/50 faction balance ?

Why would they let you skip, at least, 3 weeks of leveling? That's a guaranteed 1 month of sub time! - Also, boosts costs way more than a month's worth of sub time; that's why they allow it. ((And yes, it takes about a month to get to 120 from 110; I did it in \~4 week**ENDS**. So all you able to play throughout the week can easily do it.))
---
What they'll do is, after hitting Phase 6, announce that Classic will be updated to TBC-era. All the while, trying to mold Retail back into what made WoW popular........while still keeping the microtransactions. Because, lets face it, Classic isn't going to make them *all the money*, not with out access to that sweet sweet Cash Shop Money.
---
Great job you are a mage.
---
&gt; It was never, ever this bad in all my years of playing before. Classic PVP is simply unlike anything before, due to the massive population and massive faction imbalances.
---
I question if you played vanilla on a populated pvp server then.  Because yes, classic is worse because of higher pops, but it was still *fucking bad* in this patch back in vanilla.  This is why it makes ZERO sense that blizzard thought it would be a good idea to repeat the same mistake of launching the honour system before BGs.  Back in the day they did it because they simply weren't done with BGs yet, and they then rushed them out to fix the issue of people being unable to level due to constant ganking in the world.
---
This time around the BGs could have been released on day 1 of the honour system and *should* have been.  This is quite literally history repeating itself, but worse because of the higher pops.  It was entirely preventable by blizzard if they even listened to ANY vanilla / private server vets who actually knew what they were talking about.

A lot of the things people complain about on this sub can be solved by finding people to play with.
---
Nope... Just take 2 weeks off
---
Track humanoids is useless anyway with the short view distance we have now compared to pservers
---
I would argue that the ones who defend it are the ones on a near 50/50 server. 
---
Noone wins on a 70/30 or less ratio server. Neither side is gonna have fun trying to farm honor. The majority is gonna go 10-15min between kills meanwhile the minority side is gonna get stomped 4/5 times. Both will have a terrible time.
---
The grass is always greener on the other side, especially if someone has tendencies to whine anyways.
---
Why?
---
Very nice! Always a nice feeling to get those first bosskills!
---
I wonder when my guild will reach this point. We started raiding 3 weeks ago with +-20 ppl, the first week we got Ony down and Lucy/Mag/Gehennas, the 2nd week we also killed Garr and Baron and this reset we also killed Shazzrah and it looks we will kill Sulfuron soon. We're making good progress atm. 
---
Have to say that doing MC with 20-25ppl is actually pretty fun, especially since we also didn't chance Pre-Raid BiS or anything. We just go in with who we have and with what we have gearwise. 
---
It does feel though that should we have had 40 ppl ready go it would have been pretty easy to clear.
---
Releasing content they already have logistics and code for doesn’t seem like too much effort, but I’m no blizzard engineer.

It's literally deleting 1 word and entering 1 word (your name) in macro though. Hardly tedious. In fact, you can simply type /target %playername% and just alt+arrow up it to use. It's more than easy.
---
What... most good guilds do this in live right now. Our guild does this. Private server raids were harder than in classic, not easier. The current fastest clear of MC from starting trash to killing ragnaros is under 25 minutes. Bosses die in under 30 seconds.
---
We aren't a hardcore guild by any means and we started doing the AoE adds on Garr weeks ago.
---
The census addons never worked according to blizzard.
---
Not to mention that they are elite
---
The first playthrough is pretty amazing, congrats! And yea, I think endgame PvE is super fun (PvP as well, in moderation) and there's something rather awesome about stepping into MC the first time and working together to down raid bosses. It's a bit different this time around since many raiders have 10-15 years of raiding experience (just look at some of the "LULz Classic 2ezpz I quit" posts around) but still a lot of fun just to play with your friends and guild. Most people don't feel the need to brag about their awesome mythic skills and just enjoy the game.

**&lt;You Had Me At Zug Zug&gt; - EU-PVP Shazzrah, Horde - Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Introduction**
---
Taking the lessons learned from being a part of big guilds, You Had Me At Zug Zug is a guild that was created to provide a fun, friendly and helpful environment to its members. Despite the funny name, our guild plans on being very competitive with a very dedicated and experienced group of leaders backing it, while not taking itself too seriously. We will be pushing content and helping our guild members feel satisfied in the process and aim to build a strong community in the process.
---
**How We Help You**
---
By adopting a very organized style of leadership and tracking attendances as well as drops, while only allowing the main tank to get geared before everyone else, we hope to satisfy everyone on our roster. We are also mindful of peoples' suggestions and understand that some may not want to speak up publicly about possible shortcomings in the leadership, so we provide an anonymous suggestions box which is constantly being checked. All in all, we're all in it together. Our discord is also very organized and will provide you with a lot of helpful material.
---
**Loot Council**
---
The loot council is very basic and simple. The players with the most attendance and best performance get to roll on loot first, up to a cap, as not to overgear others in the guild. The only person which that does not apply to, is the main tank. This rule also applies to the GM and Officers alike. We will also keep track of peoples' loot and which drops they got, as that is the only other time we will make an exception, if needed to complete set bonuses, etc.
---
**Expectations**
---
Serious attitude in raids, yet lighthearted when not raiding. We like to joke around and meme a lot but we also want to be serious and get things done. We expect you to attend raids and not crack under pressure, instead adopting a calm and rational mind at all times. We will also keep logs and will talk to you privately about potential areas of improvement, should it be necessary. Raid consumables will also be taken into account and you are expected to always come with many.
---
**Raid Times**
---
Still to be announced as we are a newly formed guild and don't yet have enough for a raid group. However, we roughly estimate it to be at 6:00 or 7:00 PM CET (Server Time) Mondays and Thursdays.
---
**Conclusion**
---
We are a new guild, but should you take the leap and join us, you will be rewarded by being in a very good and fair guild, with people you may one day call [friends.](https://friends.In)

Invisibility potions up to 18 seconds of invisibility, but can be detected with warlock buff.

This is what happens when you had an MMO addiction during your highschool years and now you are 26 and haven't played an MMO since then. If I'm not at work, grad school, or with the girlfriend I'm on WoW lol
---
this is probably the only legitimate complaint in this mess
---
the server caps are so much higher than they were in vanilla and people are spreading out so much that it's very hard to escape the zerg ganking. in vanilla there might have been a couple of raids out doing wpvp at any given time, in classic there's half a dozen minimum during primetime and most of them are full
---
My server is quite balanced and I get killed as much as I kill. It's simply fun to me.
---
High-five!
---
I'm on a pve server as well. I chose the one that seemed to have the best ratio, though all of them are ally heavy. Oh well.
---
Hit 60 with a hunter, now leveling a rogue. Have not pvp'd yet, will probably not do it too soon!
---
They opted for less servers because they expect many to quit... And then don't wanna do server merges later.  They are still probably right about this too.

We had like a 1000v1000 going in south shore,  would be sweet if there was no lag
---
"here comes the pain, bitch"
---
Haha yup.
---
That's exactly what they are doing though.
---
its PvP sever and what we see has nothing to do with pvp, its honor farming and ppl r just sick of being the lifestock for gand squads ;-)
---
there was 0 reason to believe it would end up as it is on larger unbalanced servers besides retail imbalance and the fact that servers are massively overpopulated compared to vanilla, which you cant expect people to weigh when there are multiple other reasons to roll on a specific realm
---
It was easy to figure out when the majority hit 60. For instance, you can track what's the most popular instance that people are LFG/LFM. You can follow the price on certain commodities, like dark iron ore, which predictably peaks when 'the majority' have made it to BRD.   
---
The average player has been 60 for several weeks. Everybody thinks of themselves as being around 'average', but if you're not 60 by now, your leveling speed is unquestionably below average.

As a fury warrior, what advice do you have for comparing between a 2H vs two 1H? I know DW scales better, but what about this example:
---
I won [Earthshaker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17073/earthshaker) from MC. I've heard Dual Wield is stronger, but my 1Hs are [Thrash Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade) and [Lord General's Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11817/lord-generals-sword). I can't figure out if I should respec to 2H Fury and go with Earthshaker. Any advice?
---
As a rogue, it legit doesn’t fucking matter
---
Just wait till they’re not already geared to the teeth when next raids drop. They’re gonna change their minds fast when they can’t do what they want in the game.
---
Used similar addon in vanilla.
---
PSA: It's reading **YOUR** combat log.
---
PSA2: If you're on a PVP realm and don't have your combat log broken out; you are Fail.
---
Funny, I had an MC/Ony geared Alliance rogue corpse camping me earlier this morning on my level 55. He was doing the same to everyone 55 and below and would hide around any 60s that came through. The assholes are in plethora on both sides of the coin.
---
He's paying 45 a month somehow... Either selling gold or working an actual job.

The comment above yours does not appear to be underrated.
---
We would like to thank you for your vigilance and encourage you to continue rating comments.
---
pve servers are boring and low pop servers simply suck
---
&gt; People need to stop trying to 'fix' classic. There are PvE servers for a reason. There are low pop servers for a reason. People can somewhat shape their own gameplay experience but at the end of the day it's an MMO and a fight got resources.
---
There are no low pop servers in EU, and all servers are above the original intended max population.
---
That is an objective fact, not an opinion.
---
&gt;  But I re-rolled on a PvE server since that was how I have played the game since BC, no problems.
---
Of course you had no problems, you removed all risk.  It's like saying you used to run marathons but you kept getting tired so you just stopped running them and now you have no problems.
---
\^\^\^ Obviously killing rag is no major feat but for us and to do it in this way made the whole experience so memorable! We all lost out shit, the three standing guildies were treated like heroes all that weekend.
---
Pretty sure the guides say to grind to revered, then do the quests and turn in stones.
---
Is it fun playing on a zerge?
---
Feed your pet bro or i call PETA
---
Bite is better for pets to keep aggro. Best for solo.
---
Claw is better for damage,best use in parties or pvp
---
Different pets have different abilities and level.
---
You will need to tame new pets for new abilities and for higher lvl on your current abilities.You also need to buy abilities from a pet trainer.  Now you need to train your pet using beast training on general spell page.
---
If i was you i would use a boar, with charge ability you can kill mobs faster. They are also more tanky so you can take more mobs on in one fight, yes they do have less damage but not on a massive scale.
---
GIT GUD
---
"Paladin are basically plate rogues"
---
C'mon man, don't push it that far. I can't recall the last rogue who healed me in v3.
---
Potentially, it's part of the challenge for Blizzard as no-one can say either way how it will go.
---
&gt;no one does that
---
Well, at least 2 people are saying they do.
---
PS: I'm saying I did it too, when I was on a PVP Realm. Then I found addons (Paranoia) that did it for me.
---
This thread gets posted 5 times a day lol.
---
For ppl on minority servers. Just play like APES. They go from zone to zone. Killing everyone once rolling throu them in a 40man raid. 
---
Then they move on quickly. Always on the move. Rolling throu zones like a fucking tornado, destroying everything in sight but never stayling long enough to get overrun.
---
Its not super effective honor but it looks rly fun.
---
This is obviously fake because that wand doesn't exist :^)
---
I tried holy in dungeons. It’s boring. Oh so boring.
---
Talk about tank and spank
---
Same.
---
I was in the same boat.  As I was reading about Phase 2 I thought to myself, "oh this will be bad".  Then it came out and was bad.
---
I rolled PvE on Friday and had a blast all weekend.  I plan to try my PvP character again, but after a few weeks pass.  If it's still bad, I'll just say so long to my PvP guy.
---
\[laughs in bloodsail buccaneers\]
---
it'd probably happen in 9.2 or 9.3, after everybody's already boosted their retail characters and right before announcing 10.0 with the lvl 70 lvl cap
---
Maybe. Or later.
---
There was a link circulating this sub couple of weeks back and if I recall correctly Zandalar Tribe EU was very close to 50/50, maybe something like 45/55, but very close. 
---
I'm playing Horde on Zandalar too and have been dodging Alliance deathballs as lvl 31 in Tarren Mill for days now.
---
Q fucking Q. Knew these posts would happen. lmfao. get ganked
---
Just reroll horde for ez gains while making the problem worse until it gets addressed. Win-win
---
horde player on horde dominate server likes world “pvp”.... shocking :-D
---
You gotta be pretty stacked to 2-man it. It will be much easier if your buddy was holy/disc spec, and far easier than that if he were a Shaman healer, but that doesn't really help. For now I'd recommend 3-manning it because even if you *could* 2-man it, it will undoubtedly go faster with 3. Say LF1M dps, thorium res, come get your bow/herbs/water boss trinket.
---
queue dodging with cross realm bgs KEKW
---
No, don't grind at such a low level, especially not as a Warrior, since your killspeed sucks.
---
Go to Loch Modan and do all quests there. It might be a bit of walking in between, but I promise you that it will be worth your time. You want the Ironforge and Loch Modan flight points anyway and maybe you can pick up a new weaponskill in Ironforge.
---
There is also a good chance that you overlooked at lot of quests. Install ui addon \`Questie\` to see what you missed.
---
&gt; An addon that would move your character for you to evade boss abilities and that clicks your spells for you would also be quality of life. Because you could do it yourself.
---
What your describing is literally a bot. Its not quality of life its against the ToS. I'm not sure why your advocating a bot but this is even against the rules of the subreddit I'm pretty sure.
---
&gt;And that easier to track state is the problem. Sure you can try to read the combat log. It just won't fucking allow you to actually do anything with it, because you won't be able to read 10 events per second constantly. Spy can do this.
---
This works the exact same way a dps meter works. It picks up information from the combat log and lets you know whats going on. The only difference is the KoS functionality which just saves paper and the targeting functionality which is a simple macro you couldn't create without the mod at all. None of it is against the rules or different from how mods already work.
---
\*Cries in Paladin
---
faerlina is the only safe realm
---
Doesn’t matter, still reflects. It makes the succubus seduce herself, not the lock.
---
Let's be real, in classic there's 1 or 2 choices for talents per spec. It's also a major hassle to respec. Retail has a lot more customization.
---
Z
---
Blizzard has no interest in catching on because these people are paying them 15 a month. Not until they fear losing subscriptions over if
---
Time for a new zone.
---
no fun allowed in wow, if ur not min maxing you must play retail
---
I mean, would you?  You can carry a shitload of shards if you clear your bags of nothing else but your hearthstone.  Also if you're in an area u can hearth to (kargath, etc) you can easily get a portal or fly out, farm another &gt;80 shards, fly back.
---
Nostalrius did this, while being able to do lag-free WPVP on a server with no layering and x10 the amount of people vs. multi-billion dollar company. this is how they treat their fans, sell out to china
---
Yeah its very nice, we're mostly players that already played together between Vanilla and Wrath and have now come back together to play Classic again :)
---
Yeah, like ever since the phase 2 launch I've been doing less and less pvp with with numbers of kills that went something like 260, 120, 46, and every day I still got roughly the same amount of honor lol.
---
A true unpopular opinion, well done OP
---
Then let this be a life lesson: be a grown up and make your own decisions. Don't blame someone else because you went with their choice; last I checked, every human playing this game was capable of thinking for themselves.

its awesome! made me go back to retail, didnt enjoyed Bfa so much like this before

This will probably die out  give it a bit of time... in a week or two only the hardcore pvpers will do it. Also BG's wont solve this unless the queues are short, there is going to be cross realm BG's right?

with all the mounts and battle pets they added in retail, i could never play that trash again
---
Sure, but even that won't get you to Exalted. What do you do at revered AFTER getting Revered, doing all the quests, handing in the stones and using all the valor tokens?
---
right? I dunno, maybe I lucked out on Rattlegore, but it seems like it always goes down like this.  
---
Poor lower level horde dude is trying to do some questing when a band of like 3 ish slightlyyy higher ally players come and either kill or camp him. The horde player asks for some help in chat and like 3-4 guys show up, stomp the ally or at least scare em off, and then we all go on with our day.  
---
Obviously it sucks getting absolutely eaten alive by a rogue after finishing a quest mob, but it really just teaches you that you need to be traveling with friends or have better getaway options.
---
Ayy my mans unemployed with no/boring relationship. Congrats.
---
my point is it doesn't cc the lock like reflecting death coil does. it's not ideal for the lock, but it's less bad than cc'ing yourself
---
lmfao Stfu
---
The only problem is that most people are enjoying classic. It's the same scenario with the STJW community, and any other community of dumb people, they have a small vocal minority.
---
Everyone i know and i play with enjoys classic, the people you see whining on reddit are just that, crybabies.
---
What the fuck are talking about?
---
&gt;I played on a PVP server from Vanilla to Cataclysm.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I regret rolling on a PVP server and not having the foresight to realize how bad things would be with the massive population sizes.
---
&gt;It was never, ever this bad in all my years of playing before. Classic PVP is simply unlike anything before, due to the massive population and massive faction imbalances.
---
Preach.  I'm not mad about the PVP, I'm mad that there are to many people that  it is impossible to avoid when I need to do other stuff.
---
But how do you stop the same thing happening after you move?
---
'X server is Horde heavy! All Alliance move to Y'

'Y Server is Alliance heavy! All Horde move to Z'

Yes, or even Darkshore (which is really nice).

What's the Respawn Time on the Vendors for those special items? Like the arcanite recipe at alterac?
---
Pagle has nightly Qs. So Yea. Great idea doing this on a Saturday with already longest of the week
---
Yeah but what else will you do when the siccubus seduce herself but watch?
---
I know you're the one getting downvoted so I'm helping with it, there'S that :)
---
Thats basically me when it comes to doing pve raids and shit
---
Just some trivia on that topic: that is actually not true :)
---
You can't quest from 1 to 60 in vanilla. There is a quest draught leading up to 50. There are just not enough quests in the game. You need to get at least -one whole level- from grinding or dungeons in between. Most people don't notice that since they get rested xp and do a lot of dungeons.
---
Why would you roll on a PvP server then? How didn’t you see something like this coming? It blows my mind that something like this doesn’t cross anybody’s mind.
---
Also, you can hold more than one healthsotone if they have been made by a warlock with a different number of points in the Improved Healthsotone talent or whatever it's called.
---
Imbalance doesn't matter if you're trying to 1v1, even If i was on a 80/20 realm, the 20% alliance would be 40 man groups
---
Night Elf Feral Druid here.
---
No clue what everyone here is talking about.
---
I would never lower myself to the point of playing Horde.
---
Good to have you brother, i love playing with first time wow players! They are, unlike ppl who play 24/7 and are bored with the content in a few weeks, still genuily excited for content and that positive energy makes me like it more too! Even for dungeons i rather have a social team at a slow pace then people who kinda dont want to do the dungeon, but do it anyway for their BiS.
---
Are you really Ret if you specced down into Reckoning? XD
---
Dude, I wish you all the best and look forward to seeing a screenshot of your guild first kill!
---
Yes, never engage enemies above your level. Ideally you are fighting green mobs with some yellows mixed in. Especially as Warrior, the weakest leveling class of them all, you should never engage multiple enemies or enemies above your level. The effort is not worth it and chances are that you just die.
---
I think this bug is faction specific though, I see your the same faction as me and having the same issue. \*Shrugs\*
---
Level 15 might make it a bit rough but I think yes, only played alliance on pservers and that was a while ago but if memory serves that is a good way to level up for the Défias quests.
---
Tried to level in winterspring on my lvl 56 druid. Went on for about 8 hours and only got 50% of my level because of perma ganks. Leveled a rogue from 1-22 instead because of Winterspring beign unplayable.
---
Listen, classic worked well as it is on private servers for more than 10 years, full of people and only people who liked the game which is why they went all in to download and install an old, pirated version of the game.
---
The problem is not the high volume, the problem is not that classic wow needs to be "fixed", the problem is the 4 million subs who just play classic because their guild on retail is dead, because their friends play, because they like asmongold and want to s uck his dick and giving him all their gold.
---
The problem is the community full of idiots, full of crying little bitches and full of people who have NO fun with classic. Just look at all the babies on reddit making threads about how everything is wrong and unfair and how pvp on pvp servers should be a bannable offense...
---
Its the shitty ass community we have who ruin the game for everyone.
---
Classic worked totally fine for years on pservers, it worked on nostalrius and other big servers also with high volume on people. It worked because it was played by people who liked the game and people who wanted to play vanilla wow.
---
Thats why it worked because the game had the right community of people who knew what was waiting for them and people who knew which problems and bullshit was ahead.
---
If all those little mainstream bananas would just leave the game and starting to smell their finger after making sure their butthole is all clear and open, all the people who really like the game, all the people who dont put up an bitchy ass post every single day, all the people who are currently online playing the game having fun and enjoying world pvp as it is... all those people would have a great time without you.
---
Well, it ain't our primary stat, right? Mark of the chosen-procs doubles my intellect for a minute. That's enough time to submit a post to reddeert befor goin stupit agan.
---
You maybe, but I'm willing to bet most people would not
---
''I am a hunter and this mod pretty much makes my track humanoids inferior''
---
And now we know why you made this post.
---
Addon aint going nowhere, playing field has been leveled so not only hunters can find noobs hiding.
---
Stop crying.
---
That's what your statement sounded like. Sorry if I'm wrong.
---
It makes pvp more fun so you can find people instead of running by them.
---
Stop crying bitch.

maybe wait for the stunlock chain to end (rarely are wpvp rogues actually good enough to execute a full dr-reset stunlock chain) and then deathcoil out of it when reflector is on cd

I’ve done ST a few times , but eranikus always destroys us if we’re 50-52
---
I usually hit 60 before day 6 so for me 43 is not a big deal.
---
Hey that’s my home server anyway...may have to participate just for the lulz (if I’m on that is...will have to check other commitments first)
---
SMOrc
---
This is probably the most annoying thing to deal with. Everyone talks about how much fun world pvp was before flying mounts in TBC. So far world pvp has been anti-fun. You can literally play everything perfectly and it doesn't matter because 10 people will show up when you're about to finally kill someone, and then they just hang around the area afterwards. I don't think I've had a single solid 1v1 yet since I hit 60.
---
Haha I'll admit to whining however I think Horde are just way more hardcore about pvp and killing Alliance in general. Lights Hope is generally contested back and forth but the past few days BRD has been under complete control of Horde Rogues and death squads.
---
Vanilla did not have these huge populations. GTFO.
---
I guess a better way to ask the question is... Is there one dungeon in particular where I could pick up a few pre raid bis pieces and even some second or third string options
---
Retail thatta way ----&gt;
---
All along, phase 2 was just a well thought of marketing ploy for Shadowlands. It wasn't Sylvanas who was playing 4d chess, it was Blizzard all along.
---
Or enjoy a challenge and pvp.  What you describe as likng phase 0 and 1 is almost exactly what a pve server is.  You opt into content, flag for pvp, and can be in the open world on your own terms.  What you are complaining about is exactly what a pvp server is.  Unfair, unbalanced, cruel.  I highly doubt all your p1 interactions were one on one honor duels where you fought fair.  More likely you and the other faction ignored one another for mutual peace to level, sometimes getting occasionally jumped unfairly and sometimes with you tanking someone unfairly.  These posts show you how vanilla became retail.
---
Not true. I play on a horde dominated 70-30 server, and i wish i was the underdog. I can run for 30 minutes on an epic mount without seeing a lvl 60 ally, do you think that is fun?
---
If i could pay to faction change to have the minority advantage, i would. And so would any other Real pvp'er.
---
A lot of people are gonne be butthurt about this comment, but that's okay because this is high lvl truth.
---
Why would any of the 70% transfer? They are having their fun death ball roaming and still getting HKs while being shit at the game. Get the 30% off that server so the 70 can lay in the bed they made.
---
This guy rolled Tauren.
---
“And a ring I think” casually mentions one of the best item drops he has available... LOL
---
I think you might want to try PVE server or go back to retail.
---
I am fine you have your rules and people agree to follow them.
---
I am angry and mad in so many ways about "history repeating itself" I just dont want to take the polite way anymore for people who dont care and dont listen to anything anyway.
---
I expressed what I wanted to and its fine if its not made for the public babies.
---
Yes todays gaming is not about making and having a fun game, its about "how can we design this piece of shit in a way to get the most money out of everyone" and it sucks, it really does, back in the day we had Double Dragon on NES, it was so hard it only had 4 levels but we still loved it because it wasnt supposed to be a game everybody can complete.
---
But yes I know today is all about money money money, videogames are not an entertainment product anymore, they are a piece of meat you need to make it look green and healthy so also the vegans and vegets like to try it so you can the money from everyone.
---
&gt; is simply foolish because ultimately if large numbers of people quit for whatever reason, it was a detrimental effect on the overall experience
---
I dont agree and I think even if every servers dies and we only have a single server left that single server with all the people who like to play classic with their heart and soul at the game, will be the best server with the best community for everyone who likes classic to be on.
---
I'm conflicted on this, 
---
It's a really nice and helpful thought, but if we are gonna have rank 13 and 14 "reserved for individual players" like punkrat and other content creators talk about, Fuck'em. The concept of reserving shit for a special streaming class is so dumb.
---
They already gave in to these players when they release honour with no BGs.  The original plan was wsg and av with the honour launch, but "feedback" made them change that.  That feedback was idiots on this sub and the like saying "noo we want tarren mill vs southshore!!" because idiots gonna be idiots.
---
Like people here *actually* thought they were gonna get TM vs SS like the good ole days and not flightpoint camps and roaming gank squals killing lowbies.  It was *obvious* to anyone with a brain that that was going to happen.
---
I went in thinking I was the shit. But it turns out I was just shit. And I had to learn and improve a lot over 3 days to succeed.
---
If it's the owl you are after it's not worth it imo. If you like the looks then by all means but screech and claw are a bad combo of skills, constantly 0 focus if you autocast them.
---
I wouldn’t say you are. Alliance players have this victim mentality that you can’t explain. Ultimately, if you’re lower than 60, regardless of faction, you’re being harassed constantly while trying to level.
---
I would fucking love that
---
Lowest pop server in the game.
---
Atleast someone has their head out their ass. You *can* atleast pvp, i can't even if i want to.
---
Enjoy the fact that there are horde.
---
Pretty fun
---
People somehow think that standing 40 people waiting for 1 kill is fun.
---
Use you fucking brain, being on the low side is way better.
---
ah I see you haven’t bathed in the well of eternity yet
---
Also sorry for the attitude, I thought you were the person from the other reply.
---
honestly it takes about 15 minutes to setup the combatlog to do the same as spy with the only difference: no sound and not clickable ..
---
just right click the log and go to settings - many people would be suprised how many options there are - can show a setup I made of my log if someone is interested - but I guess there wont be anyone since the train to "spy is the enemy and destroys wpvp" already left
---
Thing with eranikus is that you either need damage to mainly just skip the banish mechanuc or only have it occur once, or alternatively have an off tank of sorts. I guess it's overall better if the group is 51 so they do considerably more damage.
---
We haunt your ass. But I hate not being able to teabag in ghost form.
---
You're Mr. Demacia.
---
Now you made it too obvious, I'll give this lame dodge a 3/10
---
Same. Just been stuck dead in Azshara for around 1/2 hour because a group of ally were camping the FP ( no honor for that, dipshits ). Had to wait for someone else to get ganked for them to be distracted enough to escape.
---
This is the root cause of the wPvP issue. The only reason all higher level zones having roaming bands of players at any given time killing anything that moves is because there is just too many people. Blizzard made a terrible mistake with these private server sized realms, if they don't downsize it I am not sure even BGs will go smoothly.
---
Of 60s, sure, but not of players. If you say it's the norm you are saying it's what all players are expected to have done.
---
It was pretty amazing. Whoever designed that quest really knew what they were doing.
---
It reminded me of the mage tower challenges. Tough but satisfying.
---
I hear the Benediction quest is similar.
---
Hey did he get warlord tho ?  bet you didn't even tho it was ' soooo simple i n pre patch' get the fuck out you useless waste of bandwidth.
---
pvp servers are ok and would be awesome if this fucking stupid company would stop sabotaging classic
---
Agreed here as well. Back in vanilla, Alliance was overpopulated and they were huge pricks as far as camping and ganking. Now it is horde doing the same shit.
---
I’m sure these large battles are fun, but as a person trying to level , I’m at a distinct disadvantage being at level 50. Leveling is nearing impossible
---
Apparently you used to get honor on people dismounting from flights on the first day, but that got fixed. Some people still have no idea, since the honorless target buff isn't shown unless a mage uses detect magic.
---
The problem is the 1.12 itemization. Pvp gear was never meant to be this powerful on this patch. It got buffed to give players a catch-up mechanism to AQ and naxx gear. It shouldn't be a required part of pve gear progression
---
Single-realm BGs? Yes please.
---
Realm transfers? No thank you.
---
Faction queues? Yes please.
---
I do think they should add battlegrounds, however, once they're out, that's literally all some people will do, just standing around major cities all day, so I'm ok with them waiting a while to do that. I really enjoy the active world now despite the madness. This game world feels alive with active players which is something that is dead in retail, no active world, everyone just sits around the major hub city queuing bgs or raids or dungeons, it's horribly dull.
---
Not really. It all depends on when and what mobs he grind.
---
It's warmode all over again
---
I have  a level 18 druid that I tanked my first dungeon on the other night, RFC. Going forward with lower level dungeons what role should i be looking to take on? Tanking was okay but i don't think I'm that great at it. Can i DPS in cat form? Should I try to grab INT gear to heal? I'm thinking for WC &amp; BFD coming up.
---
I think the actual reason, in this train of thought, would be to push the Classic players back into Retail because "see it's soo much friendlier".
---
I'll be the first to admit I really like Warmode. I can level on a "PVE Server", then once I get to max level and I'm bored, 'transfer' to a "PVP Server" and enjoy WorldPVP....until I'm done, then 'transfer' back to a "PVE Server".
---
It’s broken. It’s not pvp on most servers it’s just a raid of horde honor farming a trickle of corpse walking ally at BRM, EPL, DM... every fucking boat... the major cities...
---
Yeah. It’s broken. Probably going to stop playing until they bring back server transfers or WSG. This isn’t a game
---
Member when you couldn't transfer from a PvE server to a PvP server because leveling up on a pvp server was considered a challenge?
---
I member
---
I did level 20-60 just doing dungeons. It’s really not that bad. Although I was a tank and a good one so
---
The ironic thing is I believe those who want this incredible imbalance are actually much closer to the retail mindset. They don’t want competition, they simple want free stuff. They don’t want the other side to have a chance because that would make it a challenge to them. 
---
I think it’s fairly reasonable to not want one side to be stuck in hard mode while the other gets easy mode. No one says it has to be the same - I’d actually strongly encourage that it isn’t even. 
---
Just super ironic that so many people are mad when you suggest taking away their cash cow.
---
So what would be the problem? Like, server is running away from you or what? Wait 30 min, or one hour. Heck even one or two days would not matter. Like, all those who play with friends manage to progress all the way to 60 at the same speed?(they are not) 
---
Well, actually, there are such players who login at the same time at certaing days and would not login when their partner or a friend can't login, to progress only together, but it is such a minority of players, so... yeah. Still would be better than current mayhem
---
Depends on which one of the two rings
---
sure, I 100% agree. But what were you expecting? Horde and Alliance to simply keep walking past each other when you can get honor and get gear for killing opposing faction players? Of course people are going to group up and aim to over power whoever they meet. Thats the point.
---
Maybe there are just more cunts thab 15 years ago
---
It's most likely vocal people from the biggest servers crying out loud (the world is not built for pvp with 3-4 times bigger population that it originally way, indeed). They had several options to free transfer on other realms, but they didn't because whatever reasons. Their choice. Who to blame? Only themselves :)    
---
I'm playing on medium-high pop server and only places with 40-man raids ganking is around and inside BRM and the Southshore battle (plus rarely on other places like Winterspring or Plaguelands if smaller battles lead to a grouped fight). Around BRM you randomly meet them roam around and not always theres a raid roaming, on the other hand Southshore is everlasting. But never seen 40man raid camping a solo person, that's just crap people make up to justify their crying (or they have such a reputation that 40 man is camping them for a reason and in this case its most likely deserved). Everything else is mainly groups of 2-5 people and nice wpvp clashes.       
---
Btw those 40man raids are getting almost no honor anyway from the kills, so unless you need to blast another 40man, so it doesn't make sense honor-wise to make a big raid. Only to counter or camp some entrances if you want to show domination..  
---
Sure the ganking can be annoying if you want to get somewhere quickly but it can take twice the time because of the PVP, but that's PVP servers. People just got spoiled by the "times of peace" before the honor system, when nobody cared and people leveled up side by side.. I can already see the posts around, where people say they got killed by a passing raid so they didn't play on that day anymore because they were pissed.. LOL, why they rolled on a PVP server in a first place?
---
We got started 8/9 weeks ago where I would friend then recruit healers from pugs I tanked.  From there we started adding dps.  Now we have our own ubrs key and are farming end game dungeons while participating in other guilds raids for the people that have already attuned.
---
But we are getting to a point where we are big enough to start leading raids with pug support or try to clear raid content with a lot of empty slots.  Just trying to determine if the latter is a viable option.
---
Yea not like this dude is in a 5 man tank squad that probably has killed hundreds of single horde players.
---
How you doin’ mon
---
At least these murlocs don't destroy your equipment.
---
Well who could have guessed blizz would give 0 fucks about server faction balances? One side dominating every zone on the map isnt what people were looking forward to on pvp servers.
---
Your gear?
---
... My gear!
---
Yeah but why would you need it if setting is available without addon?
---
It does not get better at 60 as an alliance. If you don't have the time to corpsewalk 15 times to any given dungeon or raid you don't have time enjoy any content. I cancelled my subscription yesterday.
---
Also, not only your fault for rolling PvP. Blizzard handled it terribly. When they introduced free server transfers they should have been faction specific from the start. What they did instead was increase the faction imbalance on already imbalanced realms. Leading to the situation we have today where horde heavily outnumbers alliance on every PvP realm.
---
What’s shadowlands
---
I really did not see anyone use this mod, and I ranked up to rank 12 and played since month 1...... so yeah. Maybe it was a thing in the US but I haven't seen it in the EU
---
I play horde on pagle that has a 17:83 horde to alliance ratio and I'm loving it too TBH.
---
I guess that you going in armed in their house would have something to do with it
---
Those "last-man-standing" kills are always a blast :)
---
&gt; Wake up sheeple! We are all being led into Shadowlands!
---
FIFY
---
Have fun enterint AQ
---
Sounds like a awful server to be on
---
You’re actually fooling yourself if you believe ANYONE has a good chance at ranking, ie, getting bracket one. The people in disciplined premades are also that much more disciplined in wpvp honor farming.
---
&gt;where blizzard ~~spending~~ money on
---
generating. - Fix't
---
((Cash Shop booissss!))
---
Yeah, I pretty much get ganked by rogues anyway, even if I know they are nearby. You simply never know *when* they are gonna attack.
---
Anyone belonging to the same raid ID (the people who were in on the boss originally) and anyone not saved to any MC run can join. If someone with the same raid ID does this, it will affect the boss availability for everyone in that raid ID, essentially hijacking bosses from them if they try to form another group later the same week - so advertise it with the raid ID so people saved might join in, and make sure to mention which bosses are already dead.
---
I also play alliance and abandoned a level 34 lock on stalagg once I reached the neutral zones and realized the server was fucked.  That was 2 months ago.  I’m super happy on the realm I’m on now.  In a great guild on a balanced realm, alliance even got both world boss first kills.  Actual world pvp is somewhat balanced, we give and take with the horde.  Absolutely zero regrets in leaving stalagg.
---
Rerolling is the best thing you could have done.
---
on my server Searing gorge, Burning steppes, Felwood, Hillsbrad, WPL have their Flight paths constantly camped by horde.
---
I am having some fun tho, since Winterspring and EPL, tend to be less unbalanced, and I do get to have some pvp fun. 
---
Lots of dicks that won't help or inv you to pvp groups, but I am earning way more Honor alone, among the masses so it's still good. 
---
Not sure how long the fun will last tho, I mean, BG's are what a lot of  people are looking forward to, but I think bgs are more of a nostalgia thing that will lead to dissapointment, we will see a lot more premades, and geared people now. And AV is far in the future. 
---
People wanted World pvp and AV when they talked about classic before it's release, not "BG's"
---
On my server there a bit more Alliance than Horde... they pesky little fucks.
---
&gt;  People are just corpse camping, it's literally just ruining the open world and this is not what a PVP server is about.
---
Are you even serious with this? Every PvP server in every MMO that has ever existed is 100% like that! WoW for damn sure!
---
level 43 isnt even half way to 60 (xp required wise), I believe 46 is half way. So just cut your losses and you'll still be 60 before Xmas on your new server.
---
LMFAO. Stupid hunchbacks
---
Unless it crits... more like ambush, mob is 80%, you weapon swap, lose a whole swing global, take a few hits of pounding, clunky and inconvenient af. Besides if you wanna go both Hemo and daggers your talent build will be garbage for endgame since nobody going daggers go Hemo along with it. They go imp sinister.
---
Better have a slow MH and open garrote into hemo, slice and dice, ghostly strike and Hemo till dead. Rinse and repeat. Super simple. Very effective. No weapon swap nonsense and relying on crits to do somewhat of a decent dmg.
---
Yeah eranikus feels a bit overtuned for the dungeon, usually bosses get slightly higher level and slightly harder as the dungeon goes on but eranikus is way harder than anything else in the dungeon by far. Cool fight tho
---
Stalagg
---
Loch Modan, the lower end of Redridge quests, and Darkshore all will have quests for you. Darkshore will probably have the most getting you to 20, Redridge will get you high enough to go back to Westfall to finish off DM then back to Redridge to finish that area off. Not sure about the Loch.
---
Doesnt Tibia have like 200 online per server now compared to 900-1200 back in the day?
---
Old Nova player.
---
idc how balanced the pops are youre gonna have an awful time on a PvP server with no BGs from 50-&gt;60.   
---
People rolling PvP servers should have done their research. Now you wanna ruin it for the people that LIKE the chaos (plenty of those threads too) because yall made bad choices.   
---
re-roll on a pve server like you should have in the first place; continue to force yourself to have a bad time; or quit. Those are the options.   
---
just stop bitching about it. Plus maybe dragging out the last 10 levesl with PvP is a good thing because then people wont hit 60 as fast and be like "now what "
---
This is basically people rolling on the wrong server, not a WPvP issue. Play on pve, not pvp.
---
Yeah, it's an epic way of learning core mechanics of the hunter. Its arguebly the best quest in the game. All classes deserve a quest designed like that.
---
You can smoke for 30 years and fully expect cancer, doesn't mean you have to enjoy it
---
I like the way Icy Veins has their pre-BiS items listed, at least for Priest. It has the top 2 or 3 items per slot so just ctrl+f the dungeons and whichever one has the most results, hit it up first.
---
In a circle of hate, all it takes is one rogue camping a FP for an entire realm to go nuts.
---
I don't play mage, but that is very likely. Have a look at a few pre-raid BiS lists, should be easy enough to find out which dungeons hold the highest number of potential upgrades - then you can make a priority list of sorts. But early on, most any dungeons are good - if you have some particular dungeon quest reward that's a worthy upgrade, those might be good to prioritize as well since those are guaranteed upon quest completion.
---
He's paying for coders/content creators/voice artists/art directors etc on retail side. But Classic is already ready and working.
---
Classic has more users. Then, why are you paying for developing the game on retail wing? Also this means retail workers are not successful. Bad reputation.
---
Lol anything can pass as a “wholesome” experience when there are internet points to be had now huh
---
Just because someone has a different opinion on phase 2 than you, doesn’t automatically mean they defend blizzard no matter what. They continuously make mistakes each and every year.
---
My buddy is riding out the last of his subscription for this very reason. He has a wife and two kids and isn't super interested in spending his small allotment of personal time being someone else's honor pinata.
---
Dungeon grinding is the easiest way of avoiding that mess
---
That entirely matters on what someone has more of - time or gold. 
---
Personally I bought it at 350g which was a fair price on my server (Kromcrush). I already have my epic mount and still have g to spare. It was just tough to find Tribute runs and there are other places to go/things to do. 
---
May try and still get it but now it won’t be because I need it.
---
Go to loch modan, do the west side quests. Then go to darkshore and do some of the northern quests. Head back to redridge for 3-4 quests. Then go and finish westfall.
---
I'm just tired of everyone trying to snarl about how "if you hate world pvp now you'll hate bgs more! 
---
No, I wont. I wont because the people who are world ganking will go to bgs to farm honor, and world pvp will thin out to those who want organic encounters instead of roaming death raids. 
---
I dont think these "gotcha" folks even see the forest through the trees on this one.
---
The idea that open world questing should die out to preserve what's currently going as WPvP is rather astounding.
---
Even on a PvP server that always was a core element of the game and in Vanilla it certainly never even got close to the shit show we have now.
---
I imagine there will be a discord or something for this
---
Is [Diana's pearl necklace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22403/dianas-pearl-necklace) a drop in classic? On all the pre-raid BIS guides I see for warlocks they do not mention this necklace.
---
&gt; in classic there's 1 or 2 choices for talents per spec
---
Completely wrong for pretty much every class.
---
VANILLA WAS NOT LIKE THIS. Blizzard purposely overloaded these servers to prevent a bunch of dead servers and server transferring. An understandable attempt at managing population, but also with the poor assumption that the population would die down because "YOU THINK YOU DO..."
---
...and here we are.
---
So everything you said is false.
---
Who cares if it breaks other game breaking add-ons?
---
I’ve looked in the reddit page on there. But I’m posting this because I have a free transfer I’m willing to use. So I’m seeing if there’s anything out there.
---
probably venting their frustrations on lowbies because they can't put up a fight vs 60's.
---
Obviously, but which instance?
---
Two wrongs don't make a right.
---
If I'm having a miserable time just trying to get to 60, why would I make other people's lives miserable too just to help some people I will never know?
---
And most of the time the tank will pull anyway and youre forced to go into battle with 50% mana, and theyll still complain about you not keeping up
---
In original wow alliance outnumbered horde. In classic horde out number alliance. I'm guessing a ton of people wanted to try the game from the other side?
---
You need 5 man groups for pvp where you will shine with support and be able to support others
---
You HAVE to hit 60. Yes it sucks but you have spent so much time already, just bite the bullet and finish the race. You got this bro, you can quit after reach it.
---
Why would I go out of my way to do this for some randos I never met
---
No it's not? The 10% extra armor gets multiplied by bear form. There are definitely so many more worse talents out there.
---
OG Elf
---
In vanilla they added zeppelin guards because alliance outnumbered the horde and would serg zeppelins
---
It’s unfair to put everything on blizzard for this. It should be shared responsibility because we as community wanted wpvp and blizz gave us pvp servers. It’s we as community turning this to a shit show from day one, not blizzard. But love to blame blizzard because we only use what they gave us right?
---
Suggestion: remove all combat log add-ons. Implement half of them for players, but get rid of threat and DPs metres
---
PvP happened on a PvP server. Wow
---
Need to get some BGs out this Tuesday.
---
&gt; Devil's Advocate) The classic ranking system has one thing for it. Scarcity. There are a finite number of rank 14 weapons. It seemed like in arenas, everyone had the gear so the gear didn't mean shit. I kind of like having only a few bad asses because then it means something. When anyone can get it, then whats the point?
---
Just like arena? Rank 1 glads have titles and mounts that show they're the 0.05% of the best.
---
I would also like to know
---
PvP is ruining PvP servers. 🤔😒
---
Everything is fine on PvE servers. 🤷‍♂️
---
Threat plates classic.
---
It existed in vanilla.  Nochanges
---
Nice, I bet you're in one of the smaller servers too. Why do people upvote these posts
---
Pick up the add on TomTom.
---
How can people like you be so blind and casually advice people to leave the game? A Classic server lives and dies by it's population.
---
Only you can't hide cuz they are all running spy and you're an underleveled warrior. I gave up 9 hours into lvl 45. I can't do it. Tanaris and the horde of ganking cunts killed that character for me.
---
Don't lie about what point I was making.
---
To me, that's when the game starts :p
---
The entire questing experience is Horde privilege...except for the badass story lines you experience once before they're stale on Ally side.
---
*cries in Ony attunement*
---
Glad to hear someone is enjoying the game, so many kids crying their eyes out on this sub right now.
---
Hf!
---
Not having played Hunter at 60, I wasn't aware of how the quest line functioned, cheers for sharing. It sounds quite epic indeed, and sounds like a good way to force a player to learn about their class and, in some cases, up their game! Congrats on the achievement and your new gear.
---
Turn off Warmode then by switching to Horde. /s
---
neat
---
My server is Horde dominated, and I play Horde, but this wholly depends on where you pvp at. Sitting at Southshore isn't that efficient even if you are steam rolling them. They feel that and eventually leave. I also only average around 7-15 Honor per kill there. If you are in a guild that has people online, I've found it pretty easy to make a squad of 3-10 people who want to be efficient about farming honor. Take the pvp to somewhere more fun. My group cycles through Felwood, Everlook, EPL, TM, and Guru Arena to keep things fresh.
---
/r/choosingbeggars
---
Yes we want all of these to be impossible to build going forward. I don't care if other shit breaks
---
Scholomance and strat Undead are actually pretty much identical. Nearly every enemy can drop invader stones. Scholo has more bosses, which drop corrupter stones (8-10 depending on whether you do Kirtonos and/or jandice vs 6-7 from Strat), but not all of the bosses in scholo reward direct reputation, while all the bosses in Strat do. Also strat runs are usually a bit quicker.
---
In the end though, keep in mind, that you'll only make around 250-350 rep per run.
---
&gt; deaths from over-geared 60s.
---
You would still get destroyed if you were a freshly dinged 60 warlock. You'll just have to accept that if you rolled on a PvP server.
---
There will always be people outgearing you. At least these PvP raids constantly move around. Some fuckers are camping flight paths, which I find way more annoying.
---
because even medium-pop servers RN are 3x bigger than full servers back then?
---
I only see "well, this sucks, but the game is good", about everything in vanilla
---
Get over yourself
---
Must b nice, most server are so one sided doing anything in the world is impossible.
---
J Allen Brack is laughing is ass off reading this thread.
---
For sure... and its often hailed as a good thing for developers to listen to the community and give the players what they want.
---
We WANT everything, always.  What we NEED is pain, suffering, frustraction and the *opportunity* to earn our rewards.
---
I think most of us don't give a shit either way TBH, and if it were gone then no big deal...but as long as it is out there, I'm using it because the rest of you are.
---
Tanking can be rough at first. But as you get stronger and get more spells/abilities it gets a lot easier.
---
Also experience counts for a tonne.  
---
So I'd say just stick with it. Nobody was great at it there first time. Personally I'd say just try to run the same dungeon a few times and fix any issues you think you had.  
---
Pulls too big? Try smaller groups and pick off patrols when you can.  
---
Took too long?  Pull a bit faster.  
---
Died?  May be a bad healer, maybe you pulled when they were oom, maybe underlevelled etc.  
---
Casters causing you issues?  Learn about line of sight pulling.   
---
That's assuming you may enjoy tanking though.  If you don't, throw on a dress and give healing a go.  I find it a much more relaxing experience.
---
You can DPS but it's usually tougher to find a group as DPS. And generally there are classes which may perform "better" in that roll than a druid.
---
Because they thought they'd be on the winning side :D
---
If you’d rolled Dwarf Priest people’d still want you for Fear Ward which you can throw on so the healers don’t have to. And Spriests also buff
---
Warlocks not to mention they can still heal OK
---
No source?
---
&gt; Which is exactly what people love about arena, it's a place of skill not no life time investment to get better weapons lmao, which makes glad way more impressive than any R14 weapons ever could be, they earned it through skill not some bullshit time sink.
---
Was still the best feeling ever when TBC launched and all the server giga badasses went from being the sickest cunts in the room to hardstuck 1800 cr because they were still hard clicking all their spells.
---
I definitely agree , a lot of down time between groups I find though
---
Oh I will finish. He’s currently parked in IF building up that rested XP. My feelings may change once I hit 60 but I wish shadow has more viability in endgame content.
---
Nnnno, stupid. I actually didn't think people were gonna grief like this. Congrats man, Horde are causing Alliance to cancel subs and the PVP servers will soon be empty.
---
So no source?
---
Lol not at all
---
It's not fun for the majority of people that are getting stomped by the same premade over and over again, take a seat.
---
That’s an estimation that’s recalculated weekly, and there’s been people that have reported anomalies regarding it. We won’t know for certain until reset or Blizz says something.
---
Have you tried PVE servers? These issues are nonexistent there. Or maybe consider going back to BfA since you seem to be unhappy with current classic balance.
---
Until Phase 3 hits, as a 48 rogue, all I can say is: 
---
Fuck this game.
---
Which sounds amazing
---
Pretty torn myself. I put a lot of time into my ally druid already (like, 26 days time?) and i'm at the point where I pretty much don't have anything to do besides help people in dungeons and get on for raid. I play on Kromcrush and while we started relatively tame probably 60/40, it's gone on to be an easy 80/20 now, and it's not fun. The higher pop side has insane bloodlust and have literally shut the server down. We can't even level in our starter zones. You can find 10-15 horde in Ironforge literally at almost any point now. It's nonsense. I don't even want to help my friends and new players any more because that run to BRD or Dire Maul is gonna cost me 30 minutes of death running and a piece of my sanity, and i'm not here for that. I really enjoy pvp, and I like that edge of danger of a pvp server not knowing if the horde next to you is gonna call his buddies and bury you or if you're gonna have a silent partner in crime, emoting your way through a cave at lvl 36, cheering for each other when you help each other take down that elite mob you're both working on at 2 am. THAT's the pvp server I want. This zerg fest of hyper efficient 30 year olds that have infinite game knowledge at their fingertips is flat out bullshit, and those crying for no changes need to get a grip and realize this is going to hurt the game. For the first few days I was hoping battlegrounds might be a good solution and that we'd just have to hold strong, but now i'm not sure. With the realm sizes they are now, a medium pop like Earthfury still has more people than a full vanilla server. That kind of sucks. I started a shaman to level up on the horde side of things on Earthfury and even on a server that (and I checked w/ trade chat first) seems to be evenly balanced, i'm not so sure I feel like I even want to invest in it. Not as long as the wpvp meta is as it is.
---
Tl;dr - I'm one of these players. I love pvp, wanted the pvp experience of old, and this is a far cry from it. Let me move my toon, because I've already given the whole re-rolling on a fresh server thing a try and thus far, it's not really convincing me to give up my druid with 600+ hours invested already. Might just have to cancel my sub until the game is in a playable state.
---
Not to mention you can buy gold and items with cash in retail.
---
&gt; I have a 50 Rogue 
---
Having stealth makes a big difference in the open world in my experience.
---
&gt; faction queues
---
I barfed a little
---
Blizzard didnt even ban the LFG addon.  It's still in the game.  The author removed the auto grouping and it pulls info right from the LFG channel.
---
Poor fellas just trying to do BRD most likely.
---
Yes he did, however he never recovered the 100hp to begin the fight with. It made no difference whether or not he actually used the enchant. It's like when you get a fort buff you still need to recover the HP from the fort buff.
---
This has nothing to do with #nochanges or changes of any kind.
---
This is why I rolled on pve. I play alliance lol.
---
Well if we're going to start changing things then I also want dual talent specs and a taunt for Paladins since not having those things is also game breaking.
---
Oh look another "the end times are near" post. The amount of exaggeration about world pvp in this sub is silly.
---
Night elves were originally Trolls, so it checks out.
---
Yeah when I picked the race I thought Humans had a different racial than they did and had hit 20 by the time I realized that.
---
Yes please. Please ban enemy timer add-ons. Cc is local to the player and if it's not on you or because of you, you don't deserve to know that information.
---
This is the dumbest comment ive read in a while.
---
This is why I hope Stadia makes a resurgence in the MMO scene. I believe Cloud Gaming is the only way a modern MMO will be able to thrive. Protection against Cheating, Data Mining, Macroing, all the Mods that dumb everything down and tell you what to do. 
---
This will bring back a sense of exploration and discovery and slow people down a bit.
---
I love my Spy Addon! Stay salty rogues! 😊
---
Haha atleast you didn’t roll NElf
---
No, pets immediately disappear when you start summoning another
---
Here comes the pain, bitch!
---
Before this patch I engaged in any PvP fight I could that wasn't a clear under level gank. Not many players stayed to contest me. They would either leave or recruit others to gank me. After this patch any PvP zone is just a cluster of these groups designed to overwhelm anyone. I tried to lure or get an even slightly fair 2v1 situation against me, but they don't do that. This is not "world PvP" where I'm questing or gathering, need a mob or node, and encounter an alliance I need to contest for. This is a massacre. The only people enjoying it are in those groups and being in one of those groups is simply dishonorable killings. We need battlegrounds to reduce the numbers of these zerg teams in the open world. It isn't fun. It isn't competitive. It's not sportsman like to have a raid kill a couple of dudes. I've cancelled my sub until they're introduced because this isn't "classic" - there were never raids like this unless it was a statement to the other faction in an attempt to kill their leader.
---
\#StopTheMassacre #FreedomForAzeroth
---
Don't like going deaf from a random meme soundboard instead?
---
It baffles me because if they're a skull to you, you're not an honorable kill to them.
---
They're PvPing for the honor, but they camp lowbies that don't give honor. It's seems counterproductive.
---
It’s the same percentage difference. I don’t know why it makes a difference? You have the same disparity between the factions regardless of the total number... it’s the same percentage..total number doesn’t matter at all?
---
Oozing with youth and smugness, or is it just me?
---
We’re still doing this any time someone has even the slightest complaint about Classic?
---
Feeewweer
---
Can't recall and not at my PC to check now, but sounds pretty close to the truth - I'd have guessed Wednesday (EU), but close enough for government work.
---
I keep seeing this sentiment, but as a lvl 53 undead warrior who can't play for 2 mins without being killed by gnomes and night elves, I want alliance to be aware that it's shit for all of us. I'm completely put off playing anymore because it's so crap being constantly killed while just trying to solo quests peacefully.
---
Honestly, it's possible to move around any of the default blizzard frames with console commands and scripts, and those do not persist after relog and have to be re-run every time you load your character into the world. It's not quite the same as with cvars, but I can see how it would be easy for someone not familiar with the technicalities to assume something like that.
---
Flamelash does seem decent. Agree with the slight Horde bias on the numbers but there are plenty of Alliance groups fighting it out and being put together In LFG. Can’t comment on raid guilds, but for rerollers and levellers, there are groups for all 5 mans and always people telling to group for elites etc. Nesingwary’s is always carnage but even on my 33 Druid, contributes to 24 kills there yesterday as alliance before the horde countered us
---
&gt;(like rogues/warlocks losing poisons/curses)
---
that's one of the changes coming to Shadowlands, totems, curses, poisons, auras etc. are coming back
---
Loved this quest chain tbh, Also still using celestrial orb, wand, and hypnotic blade well into late 50s.
---
do you mouseclick ?
---
For group also is. 
---
Balance with ns is also viable - more damage, but lacking of spell interrupt hurts.
---
You will never fix the balance through the players. Too many people care about being in the biggest faction on the biggest realm. I don't understand all the complaining about overpopulation when there is literally realms at medium pop still. People refuse to move, since the very start
---
Buy some invisibility potions. 
---
Cheap and will get you through.
---
..That's the duo that dude is utilising.
---
You're being pretentious.
---
You don't even need to open your macro menu to do that.
---
Just write "/tar thatGuy" in your chat box and you will target him
---
vanilla players didn't expect the stupid population caps of a much higher pop than the original game
---
pservers teenagers might, but vanilla players
---
Acting like horde is and different from alliance is childish. Humans are always opportunists, and just because you've gotten fucked a couple times doesn't mean that people are any different.
---
Definitely not! I mean it is a dead game after a month after launch. 
---
No, wait..
---
wrong dream though
---
I just want to do all the raid tiers again. SSC/TK/BT/Sunwell all very well designed raids. Zul'Aman? I played Human Paladin in TBC, but I would LOVE to play Male Draenei with Stunherald... or get Full T5 + Gruul's Shield for tanking! TBC has to happen for me :(
---
Good for you, probably isbt reflective of the average player's experience.
---
Well hey, rerolling is always an option 🤷
---
But I guess it depends on how much time youve already invested, I was lucky I saw this coming and rerolled when only lvl30.
---
Hello OP,
---
I felt your pain this week as well. I’ve been salivating over Rhok’delar for months now and my guild finally had a leaf drop after months of eyes. 
---
When I finally built the bow I was so happy! I saw that massive top end and thought ohh boy this is going to pierce souls on my Aimee shots. Then I equipped it.... I was using the 3.3 speed Xbow from ud strat... and I looked at the top end dmg increase .... ~12!?!? How can that be!? The top end damage increase is 42 over carapace. Surely, I thought this must be a mistake and then the dps output looked roughly 15dps higher. 
---
Overall, I’ve found it is really nice to hand a slightly faster weapon in PvP but the upgrade is underwhelming. I’m only 3 pieces off from bis on my Hunter and when I spoke to a hunter in worse overall gear but with Rhok last week I was shocked to see I did more dmg and had higher crits. I thought that must be a mistake but it was in fact a forewarning. 
---
Your post made me realize I was not alone in my sentiments and hopefully you realize you’re not alone in yours. I was truly hoping for at least an increase in 40 top end but maybe that would be too much. I noticed from it that Atk power can have a comparable impact and I’ve started using thorium arrows for me vs the world PvP to try and get that maximum top end.
---
If you look at phase 5 then some lists has it
---
What no, his guild is crimson something, not smorc
---
This isn't actually a bug, it's because your character has died and you need to Epstein didn't kill himself to your body and press the resurrect button.
---
Hahahahah, another retail crybaby.
---
Maybe go play another one of your solo RPG games, where you don't have to worry about other players beating you?
---
It's so hilarious to see bad players cry about PvP. You know they offered PvE servers, right?
---
Does it still autoloot to your bags with that method?
---
on average it takes 15 deaths to get from thorium pont to BRD on my server
---
There’s a difference between knowing that PvP is going to get you killed versus being in a completely lopsided “battle” over and over again with your ability to progress virtually gone. 
---
Is it really whining to look at reality and see your situation as being completely fucked?
---
PvP has the potentially to be good - but the things that are necessary to make that happen would have required earlier controls from blizzard and now would require actual changes to the game.
---
:(
---
Your Simone method is unnecessarily difficult. You can just kite her indefinitely with Cheetah and she’ll never hit you.
---
https://streamable.com/f0onr
---
I also prefer the kite method for Solenor because you don’t need a Warlock for CoR, and no RNG on bugs.
---
https://streamable.com/2ro1x
---
That said, your Klinfran strat is cool.
---
If they go by server type we won't get queued with anyone :P
---
(rp server)
---
People like you are certainly how gamers get a bad reputation.
---
not really, I just misunderstood the question.
---
&gt;You don't even get honor for killing people off the flight path.
---
Nope, they do not. But what they end up doing is camping the graveyard or the fp anyway, and when the people finally do respawn they get murdered again
---
I have had a lot of fun in roaming squads of 5-10.  
---
Hillsbrad is boring and crappy honor, so I just don't go there.
---
Everyone knows what the problem is, it's the solution that people are disagreeing on.
---
Some people are saying, "deal with it or reroll," others are saying, "let us pay for transfer to PvE realms," and others are saying, "reduce population limit on realms." Every option has pros and cons, so it's about which option is best. Honestly, I think the "deal with it or reroll" is the best, as the other options harm long-term viability of servers, with lowering population limit coming in a close second. Allowing transfers opens a whole can of worms that could very easily cause irreparable damage to PvE realms.
---
You mean there are skeletons when they unsubscribe?
---
Grats!  Man kills like this are always exciting.  Good for you guys!
---
They mix RP and RP-PvP IIRC
---
I got ganked by a 60 Rogue at the anvil in Orgrimar the day phase 2 released.
---
undead mages are the bane of WPVP
---
A Scrubs mistake of marketing. You bought to early, while prices were falling. In the perfect world you buy in the very moment when prices are lowest and start to raise again. That's not gonna happen, so you wait until prices rocked bottom and start to climb again. That's when you start buying, hold the item since prices are way up and then sell it bruv. Done
---
thats the quest helper interfering with classic wow, go back to retail, it should fix the problem
---
But you see, you were playing retail servers, not classic ones. There is a big difference as you may see on your own personal experience.
---
Yes, you will get 1 per node always
---
I was level 40 when I stumbled into that one :D
---
You should have been over at Dire Maul. That's where the Horde has been farming Alliance and making me corpse walk all damn night.
---
&gt; How long till the post titled: Can we just acknowledge that all the tryhards who camped the minority faction right off the server are just regretting killing their server pop now that here is no one to do the AQ opening quests?
---
Meanwhile on a PvE server (Westfall) alliance outnumber horde 3:1 so any hope of doing AQ is out the window.
---
Found a enchant recipe on hands to increase mount speed.  TSM tells me it's worth between 100 and 200G.  Is this legit?
---
I saw some ally scum having this bug yesterday too, maybe you can download more ram, pretty sure it will fix it
---
Genuinely don't know - does your combat log tell you faction and race of the rogue stealthing?
---
People like me, who advocate to play on servers that fit your desired way of gaming? Yeah, we make all gamers look so bad!
---
No, the people who whine about every fucking tiny thing, cry like little babies constantly about a feature of a video game they knew were coming, who had a chance to play on PvE servers - those are the people that give gamers a bad reputation.
---
Lol, summerkids being butthurt for rolling PvP and now crying over experiencing PvP.
---
Also: Thanks for the nice tip, will install Spy as soon as I get home.
---
inb4: I'm alliance on a horde dominated server and loving the wPvP. That's life, kids.
---
The release of phase 2
---
I was with you until your stupid fucking edit
---
Small groups main advantage is mobility. You wipe a group, then move before the bigger guys arrive.
---
&gt; How about this: Healbot could just show you which character to heal next. It could also discern on which spell is your best spell to do it.
---
&gt; One could also make it so it communicates with other Healbot users so nobody heals the same target. It would be completely possible with macro shenanigans. In fact, it was in org vanilla. In vanilla healers would just left click the same spot over and over and it would heal perfectly.
---
The problem is there is no equivalence between the old heal bot which healed for you and spy which literally just tells you when there is enemy contact IN YOUR combat log. Data supplied to you by the client. You can't have a mod that does the playing of the game for you. Mods that simply give you information and then allow you to target someone the same you can with it isn't game breaking. Its barely game altering. I feel like your trying to make a good point but then use something completely against the ToS and compare it to something completely within the ToS.
---
On a side note the changes I've seen suggested to change it would immediately reduce the functionality of dps meters. Something that seems pretty counter productive to break a mod just to stop a different mod that is again completely in the ToS.
---
Hydraxian waterlords! We need you
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I would probably use a 2h not a dagger.
---
Did you lvld up as enhanc?
---
As someone who runs in big pvp groups i completely understand your pain, the guy replying to you is a jerk.
---
Even while running in these deathballs hunting hordes people express really wanting battlegrounds.
---
Only happens to alliance players
---
Problem is that 40man raids werent the norm people looked forward to world pvp not zerg fests. I love small scale world pvp it just dont seem to exist, before honor people just tried to run away now people go around in giant raids.
---
&gt; It’s not world PvP it’s honor farming.
---
You mean the biggest reason people World PvP'd since patch 1.3 in Vanilla? okay mate.
---
No it isn't. Not in that amount nor intensity. Not even close.
---
Y'all are the only PVP server that has an Alliance favored ratio, backed by two relatively reliable population sites and now your own /who'ing, grats on being the unicorn
---
Overall with pve and pvp servers included total population is probably near 50/50.  But you have to ask who is going to be queueing for BGs more?  Which faction is going to have more tryhard rankers?
---
As a vanilla wow pvp vet, who exclusively played pvp in vanilla, I have approximately 24 kills all week since the pvp stuff released. 
---
Simply put - world pvp was nostalgic because up until that point there was no system at all. Bgs were an improvement, gave people purpose beyond mindless zergs and dhks. I’ve tried to participate in some pvp, but it just isn’t fun. Wpvp isn’t about who is the more skillful in a balance battle. It is about who can get the most people to show up. 
---
Until then, you guys enjoy wpvp. I don’t judge those who want to do it now, I’m sure folks have a lot of fun with it. But it just isn’t for me.
---
Its worth what ever someone is willing to pay on your server.
---
Sure, abandoning a level 43 character may seem like a bit of a waste. But let me ask you this: don't you think it would be even more of a waste leveling the character to 60 if you are not enjoying it?
---
The 5 days or so, that you have spent leveling the Warlock is lost. There's no way to get that back, so it should not really impact your decision to reroll or not. Instead think about what you would prefer to do for the next 5 days? Or the next 50 for that matter? I think you will find you answer there.
---
Yes, it’s called „the warrior experience“
---
Hi,  
---
You don't need Holy Shield to efficiently tank dungeons like Scholo and Strat as palading. Its enough to have Blessing of Sanctuary. Instead go 5/5 Holy Power in Holy tree - then you are just as viable as raidhealer as any other Paladin - whilst also able to tank. 
---
Following spec will make you viable to both tanking, healing and AOE farming :  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxudgoxVGzIcz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxudgoxVGzIcz) 
---
Try to farm the Deathbone paladin tank set in Scholo - if you have no starting tank gear.
---
depends on server but prob. took me forever to find someone on mine who had it. so it might be rare on yours
---
I did SM Library runs at 40 with 0/5 MoD. Missing Camouflage will make the run slower, but it's still doable. I think you'll be fine at 36 if you just play it safe.
---
Wait you straight up gave up a lvl 54 cause you’re scared of leveling? Go do dungeons
---
The details damage meter has a built in threat module. 
---
Hover over the settings gear in the top right
---
Hover over raid modules
---
Click on tiny threat
---
Optional create a second window so you can still see your dps
---
Yh rerolling is not an option for me, i volountarily threw my life away to play wow for about 3 months and then quit, i dont have time or patience to lvl again
---
IT WAS ALL A PLOY FOR RETAIL
---
It will calm down in the next days/weeks. For now unfortunately you are stuck with what you are already doing (gold farm, Maraudon, etc).
---
I’ve never understood this. There are more meaningful choices in retail talents than any spec in classic and you can actually change them without a huge time investment to test them out.
---
Im playing on Skullflame EU, High pop, 36% Ally and 64% Horde according to this [wowhead link](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community).
---
Im playing human warlock FYI, so the faction that is way under populated, and I didnt face huge issues with the ganking/pvp - I moved on to remote locations and did my thing there.
---
Bring deviate delights and hand then out
---
There are no official statistics on faction balance. There are only statistics gathered by some addon, which is not relevant result if only part of the population has it. And even based on these imperfect results(or lets say educated guesses), the imbalance is not on all servers, it goes both ways and varies from server to server if H or A. You cant just say to roll Alliance for faster queues in general.
---
Doesn’t matter, you’ll get ganked by the 10 man raid in booty bay.
---
I've found plenty of spots to grind from 55-60. Spots fluctuates often but from my experience Silithus has some pretty good grind spots. If that gets boring, find a dungeon group and make the corpse run.
---
 so sorry I triggered you you simple minded snowflake with my facts
---
I hope all the alliance on your server do roll pve so you and your 8 year old(mentally) horde buddies can circle jerk each other while running around not finding alliance to kill
---
Perfect!! I was afraid ele lvling was a bad choice. I don't want to go the enhance route.
---
Do you stop to drink often?
---
so why shouldn't people criticise this change?
---
Very nice of them to do so.
---
I love how arrogant people who play on PvP servers are, especially on here, with their attitude "Huh, re-rolled? what a weak fuck. Shouldn't have originally rolled on our glorious PvP realm to begin with. Hah! weak..." like yeah okay settle down Doomlord Neckbeard.
---
They didn't hide their API, they protected the /who command. CensusPlus had been running for almost a month and showed the break down.
---
I think the real reason they wanted to stop it wasn't because "ermahgerd layer-hopping". But because they didn't want proof that Retail sucked. Not for us, but for shareholders. - They report WoW Subs as Classic *and* Retail, and only state that Classic drove an up-take in subscribers. But if it came out that Classic had just as many subscribers as Retail (Retail is estimated around 2-3 million). Shareholders would demand they put more money into the 'Classic Project'.
---
As a dev, you don't want to hear "you're predecessors did better". So, they opted to break the addons a month before Blizzcon.
---
I also don't think Blizzard has the code setup to block making characters based on factions; just "is the server 'at capacity' or not". - I have never seen them implement it on Retail since I started in 2006.

---
Didn't play on private server. Why did they know it would happen? Was it just the culture on private servers that transferred?
---
That build looks perfectly fine for tanking 5-mans and healing the current Raids. Might want to drop 1 point from Devotion aura or toughness for the final point in improved Righteous Fury (You really want the extra threat since you don't have a Taunt)
---
I have been tanking 5-Mans, and Healing UBRS/ONY/MC with a build mostly like that. The most important factor for tanking dungeons as Paladin in my experience is Mana Management. 
---
I put my points in Reckoning instead of OneHanded specialization. Partly because I mostly use Seal of Wisdom when tanking to reduce downtime, and my threat is from holy damage, not the damage from my sword. Reckoning gives more chances to proc Wisdom.
---
That's a warrior?  Is he healing a 40 man with bandages?
---
Ahh yes the common elitist. You probably hit 60 3 weeks into classic, either play on a balanced server or the dominate faction.
---
And so was the current world PvP system, but you're arguing that scale changes things for *that*, and I'm saying scale changes things for transfers.
---
That's why I like my pets with 1 only one dps ability, like claw. Even then, growl gets delayed from too much focus being dumped.
---
Leveling in retail isn’t even tedious. Hell, they even did a small revision to it and are going to implement a massive revamp to remove any tedium.
---
But you get 110-120 in 1.5 zones, or in a few hours with in-game dungeon boosting (it’s stupid fast). Plus 120 boosts are pretty new, only a few months old.  Thinking they design the game just to sell boosts is some serious tinfoil hat stuff.
---
probably the website that tracks wcl entries.
---
wich seems to be the most accurate estimation of the lvl60 population at the moment.
---
I am new. but how is this not perceived as pay-to-win by the community?
---
The Need/Greed system is pretty straight forward. 
---
You understand it, your son gets it. I don’t know why so many are confused by it or twist it to satisfy their own agenda.
---
I love it. I often follow the main raid in my guild own smaller raid. I’ll bubble myself and bop my friends mage and we will suicide charge and blow AOEs and sappers. Not always fruitful but it’s so fun!
---
Not bad.
---
You started playing the when you logged on for the first time! Because leveling is a big and fun (my opinion) part of this game :D 
---
60 is just a new big chapter on your adventure!
---
Gz to 60!
---
Name 5 things thats Alliance favored.
---
People gank you no matter your level because they can.
---
Spy is completely useless in BGs though.
---
Yep. The time to act was early on, pause faction character create until things balance out. Every week it will get worse and harder for blizz to fix. Even still - They have so many options to fix the problem but choose to leave it fucked up
---
I personally canceled my sub. I have no faith in blizzard.
---
&gt; alliance priest and mage were camping northern stv on my server
---
Only 2 of them? Not even 20? You're playing on easy mode.
---
For people playing on PvE servers, has Phase 2 made much of a difference at all for you as far as WPvP goes?
---
What faction and what server do you play?
---
You people don't understand what you are even saying.
---
This problem is exactly the result of learning from blizzard's history.  They told people about mega servers.  They said they are full and not to go there.  They have given transfers off those servers and people don't take them.
---
The reason this problem exists is because of the massive bitching they get from people about "dead" servers.  What do they do?  Let people keep going to the big servers instead of forcing them to smaller servers where they might bitch about being dead later.  Why aren't huge swaths of people transferring off if this shit is so unplayable?  Because they fear "dead" servers more.
---
This is what players want.  The only change is the players want blizzard to move OTHER people off their server, just not them.  They want to make it more difficult for OTHER players without harming themselves.  They want OTHER people to have been prevented from playing on the server, just not them.  Ever notice how it's always people saying X should have happen by someone who has absolutely no intention of leaving the server?  Clearly that person ants to stay, they just want others gone.
---
You running daggers ?
---
It’s sarcasm because 40v40 is equal numbers, thus a fair fight...
---
Does it work for you? I tried Spy and couldn't get the coords option to work, uninstalled it but now I'm playing most in full time black and white, probably will get it back.
---
if you didn't have cross realm you could absolutely have 1 or 2 bg instances going on realms with no alliance, even with cross realm horde will have pretty excessive queue times when they do release bgs.
---
If it's 1/30 runs, it might suck but it sure isn't the new mode de vie.
---
I love this comment, it says everything I was thinking but in a nuanced way I couldn't pull off.
---
I said PVP system with no BGs, not no BGs.
---
There was 8* weeks between the patch that introduced the honor system to the patch that introduced BGs.
---
I would be enjoying the pvp if they didn't break my server with the way they implemented transfers.
---
Stat priority is pretty much Stam, crit, spell/attack power for every class.
---
Your goal is to survive burst, as damage deal burst, and as heals dump big heals quickly.
---
i think solo/duo ganking inside/outside neutral cities like gadgetzan and everlook is the best current honorfarm.
---
No, elemental.
---
Nope!
---
Thing is it was good for pre raid not for PvP for example hunter and warriors would perfer more armor and stamina. So as not many people are leveling as much as 1-2 months ago they don't need it that much
---
That spy addon though, lol
---
nah you just had idiots in your groups. the way you guys play is the usual way of how it goes. Need if it is a upgrade.
---
 Now I would say after you hit 60 and people are trying to get their pre-raid bis, I would say its kind of scummy if the item is another persons Bis but a slight upgrade for you and you still need on it even though you will end up replacing it with your Bis later on
---
I personally don't find any pleasure in ganking, I do enjoy a fair fight, and really don't care if I get zero honor for it. I don't need a number to give me a sense of achievement
---
You posted this at like 7 am on a Monday. Totally not representative of anything.
---
Define hardcore pvp? Is it ganking people in numbers?
---
Idk man I took me /played 10 days as a rogue and I still hit 60 before hand. I think the majority was 60. The only people I know who didn’t hit 60 were just not trying to hit 60 (such as a friend who has 5 lvl 30s instead of one lvl 60)
---
Isn’t Earthfury also alliance dominated?
---
I think I used up all my RNG luck already:( 
---
Both main hand and off hand dropped for me in three runs and I rolled 90’s on both to get them.
---
It's fun when the server your on is balanced. Blizz made 0 attempts to balance this out.
---
While solo every 3-4 kills. As enhance not really often.
---
No.
---
Rogues are not that important. A warrior can quite literally do anything a rogue can, and more. Obviously with itemization thats a bad idea, but this is coming from a rogue himself. 
---
But that doesnt mean a rogue should run around and light fucking campfires for the casters, you are still one of the best dps classes ofc you are useful.
---
Why would anyone do it?
---
Tree fiddy
---
Dude, rogues trying to gank in flame crest? C'mon.  Yesterday I had a rogue 2 levels above me attempt a gank when I landed, and since he couldn't stun lock effectively, it was a cakewalk. Zerker rage and retaliation meant a dead rogue, one MS crit and a cheeky overpower crit and whirlwind later...ded gnome
---
Why would a rogue try to gank a 2h arms warrior idk?  2 levels below.  I had to use a cooldown, but when he rezzed and tried to kill me again, I had already  bandaged, and the second kill involved a heal from a priest that just landed.  I would like to mention I was not disarmed at any point either.
---
He had raid gear, so I can only expect it was the combat swords rogue trying to gank a lowbie.
---
Have seen a lot of shit rogues try to gank in wpvp.  You do realize when you pop out of stealth and attack someone just minding their own business they probably have everything off cooldown.
---
I have not heard of any new need guidelines. If you need it, need it. These people sound horribly toxic, I wouldn't worry about them. Sounds like a lot of fun what you and your son have going on! Enjoy!
---
These addons were clearly a thing in vanilla, why do you want them to be impossible?
---
How is it pay to win? All he is a paying for is the accounts. Pay to win is paying money for in game items etc. This guy is playing 5 accounts simultaneously, the attention and stress are probably very high. Honestly I don’t see any issues with it. How is it affecting you personally?
---
i have about 10 bank alts. so if im trying to make a new one im not allowed anymore? :(
---
Would just as soon stop playing than potentially lose my nickname I've been using for 15+years
---
Meh, i have it downloaded and do use it. But am completely fine if it gets removed/fixed. 
---
I think limiting the range of combat log parses and auto-targeting would be an acceptable "fix". But that's me.
---
The best approach would've been to decrease the level range for honorable kills. It's basically impossible for a lvl50 to win against a lvl60, so giving incentives for killing them (and calling them honorable kills..) is crazy. Decreasing it to even 5 would mean you're relatively safe from lvl60s until you hit 55, which means you'll at least be ready to enter most of the high level dungeons and have finished most leveling zones. All the quests in Ungoro, Felwood and Azshara have basically been removed from the game now since they're impossible to do. Even if your faction is dominant on the server, the lvl60s on the other side will be running wild in those places and your own are too busy camping the dungeons to protect you.
---
this goes both ways
---
you are ruining the game for people who don't think the same way you do
---
That's because if they left undead as 'undead' you also wouldn't be able to use heaps of 'humanoid only' type attacks on them. So for the sake of simpler pvp, they made undead 'humanoid' type.
---
29/11/11 is sick with gear. The problem is you can’t play like a mage. 
---
You open in cat, get your bleeds up, MF, IS and kite. If it’s a melee you can root and drop a big Starfire on them. 
---
Bear for charge, bash and soaking damage. 
---
Becomes a lot more viable after AQ. 
---
Look up Rubix on YouTube. I think he runs balance for a good portion of the videos.
---
But why would I want to disable it?
---
I would put money on BG's being released earlier, separate from p3, like the were in the original game
---
They are worse, but fairly comparable to devilsaur leggings, and you don’t need the set for the hit. 
---
If you are looking to sell, I’d start with slightly lower than whatever the DS Legging market is at.
---
Yeah that’s very much not the case(the last part). It feels different because it is different haha. 
---
I’m pretty ok with what we have but I will definitely admit this world pvp phase is a bit of a failure on the whole. It ruins the experience for a lot of ppl. Personally I’m doing ok out there because I have a group of old school arena dudes. 
---
Can’t wait for BGs though.......
---
I'm a pussy then. I like seeing what is being cast. Allied or enemy.
---
Pets actually have a quite high uptime in MC compared to other raids, you must just be really bad at using them.
---
He needs some milk
---
World pvp will normalize once a bulk of people get it out of their system.  It's the new shiny thing and more people are doing it right now than will next week.  Next week will have more people doing it than the week after.  It will go down over time, but the first 1-3 weeks was always going to be like this.  For many people farming honor isn't the issue, it's just the new thing to do.
---
There's been some battles, especially in hillsbrad, but for the most part nothing's changed much.
---
right. and now it doesn't matter who is online and what class they play because anyone can play any class and be summoned. they don't even have to be on the same server anymore. and the single defining factor we can trace the loss of the mmo back to is world travel. I rest my case.
---
Some people gank lower levels to try and draw out 60's.
---
If you’re being seen by spy you don’t know how to properly rogue.
---
Nah, I've had this bug on my warrior since launch.
---
Pretty good, but devilsaur still exists. No more than 50g probably.
---
Why is Thrash Blade better than Cho'Rush's Blade in MH? I also use Cho'rush's Blade in MH and Mirah's Song in OH as a combat/sword spec lvl 60 rogue. 
---
Cho'Rush's has almost 5 more damage per second than Thrash and besides that it has +28 AP. Is the Thrash's chance on hit really that much better or why do you favor this sword so much? 
---
Dude get off your high horse. Calling everyone a crybaby who doesn't agree with you. Your main point is correct, but your attitude is annoying.
---
I'm saving this as a future copypasta for anyone else complaining. 
---
^^^^/pebkac ^^^^^lmao
---
Hah yeah, I feel like that’s an extreme gift to the player.
---
I’ve been playing the game since vanilla, and I know a lot of people who play on different realms. My friend who’s good and plays the most is on arcanite reaper so that’s where my main is. Got a brother on another server, co workers on another server, childhood friends on another server, and I know several of the popular streamers from being a gladiator in arena for multiple seasons so I threw a character on faerlina also. I play 2-3 hours per day, devote 5 days a week to the main, and level each of the alts through the rested level once per week. I started out staggering the alts so they’re at various levels ranging from 15-39 currently. In a year I’ll have devoted a relatively small portion of time to the alts while still getting to 60.
---
Auberdine, it's a french server though. We have 80vs80 wpvp battles in southshore at 2am. Not many players self flagging though, I did it for most of my leveling but didn't see anyone else do it.
---
I'm guessing most pve servers with decent population sizes are the same.
---
*genocide
---
It is only a very short phase of the game where this happens. You can like pvp servers 95% of time and still dislike phase 2.
---
Yes, you get used to it.
---
The prices will go up eventually. But alot of ppl are stockpiling waiting for just that to happen. Now they wanna sell their hoarded stuff off and are thus actually lowering the prize. 
---
It will take a couple of weeks but the prize on things should start climbing eventually.
---
WHO WILL DRAG ME TO COURT?
---
They're better than devilsaur leggings (for non-warriors) if someone has already replaced the gloves, if that is any help.
---
I read this and thought, “this guy sounds like he plays on the horde”. Then I saw your symbols lol
---
Agreed, this is a massive problem imo
---
Who needs cast bar addons? Who needs any addons at all?
---
Can't speak for everyone, but I personally dont see the fun in attacking lower level players. 57-60 is the sweet spot of players I'm willing to engage on. I'm realistic and don't ever see myself attaining high warlord so I dont see the need to farm for honor on 48-57
---
In the off-chance I see a 52-level player, I'll emote and follow their lead, but for the most part, it leads to us passing through and going separate ways.
---
Only time I'll attack lower levels is if they attack me or they're ganging up on a lone horde
---
Like I said, I do get the group of 10-15 alliance camp me here and there, but that's why I try to avoid higher dense areas like un'goro. It's still all part of the game though, remember to enjoy the journey!

In rogue v stealth class, the opener usually decides the win. In PVE, you get a ton of damage off the opener so a mob detecting you is very bad.  Builds without MoD are either for strictly dungeons/raids, or farming tons of lower level mobs where you won't get detected as much anyway.
---
Cries in Bear form
---
Me too man, me too.
---
Are you currently playing a 48-59 character on a populated server? Running around in chaotic world pvp is great if you have even a theoretical chance of doing anything, but in the "not 60 but gives honor to 60" range it's insanely frustrating.
---
That breaks cast bars.

Yeah true just continue leveling that warrior then you’ll hav a bad time. I’ve played every class up to 40 at least except hunter and priest my favorite is probably priest now but back in the day it was warriors

You are dead wrong. Rogues are hardly affected.  Hell, go look at someone STREAMING themselves playing rogue, they still own people and get top honor.

I have been killed more Yesterday than I was killed leveling between 40-60. If I get killed as much today, I will have been killed more than I was killed level 1-60 in the span of 2 days.
---
With that I mean, almost nobody killed me when I leveled. We all kinda quested beside one another. Now for example there was a 10 man raid group that assaulted Kargath for at least half an hour. Or there was a 3 man ally group that killed people in front of DM. Or a 5-10 man Alliance group that roamed Winterspring. 
---
And these were only the occurrences at 1-4am on a server that according to statistics should be Horde dominated.
---
How many weeks would that take? What level is the majority of players?

No one hates wow like wow players
---
Yeah, typical redditor behaviour that is. Go ahead and call everyone disagreeing with you bad. How old are you, 12? Seriously, you guys never change. 
---
You know what? Stay with your incredibly useful pet that's going to get two shot in raid and during world pvp clashes meanwhile I manage to survive a rogue who oppens me in a fucking Menethil boat.
---
Believe me I read that already. No quest at High Lord
---
I had no idea they could just ice block out of fear like that. That combined with the ability to blink out of stuns is just insane.
---
I don't know about you, but I love putting 1 point into a talent that shortens a cooldown by 1 second!
---
It definitely shows that there were multiple quest creation teams in WoW. I wouldn't be surprised if one team was vastly more creative than the other one and use the questing script engine to its fullest to come up with engaging quests and original ideas.
---
And still no honor. Also you forget horde outnumber. “Relatively balanced” still means thousands more horde because the servers are so much larger now.
---
People aren’t participating in PvP anyways. They roll on PvP realms and then cry here when PvP happens. It’s really hilarious.
---
It's more work combing through a combat log for relevant information than having an addon with built in targetting macros doing it for you.  Again, a vast majority of people won't do this, but Spy is very popular.
---
Mostly busy, we have been clearing the 9 bosses for four weeks but had a lot of the roster change/busy so this was the first serious attempt!
---
This is the second comment today that mentioned this.  Are these being talked about by Blizzard or is it just something people want to see?
---
They can cross realm BG with the PvE servers that are Alliance dominated. Sorry but overall there are going to be more Horde anyways so it'll be physically impossible for PvP servers to ever be balanced and wanting to force Horde to quit the game is not a solution despite reddit circle jerking about it.
---
I play PvE, and I'm happy. There's a lot of PvP happening on my server, and they all seem to be having fun. I'm just happy to see that we're all getting the fun out of the game that we were looking for. Keep at it, and have fun y'all!
---
Seriously I fkin hate it.
---
The Alliance on Fearlina are not a bunch of wet fuckable pussies like you are.
---
Keep being a little crying bitch about getting fucked like the pussy you are in PVP.
---
Ye, right, letting others get honor while not getting it yourself is a great way to get rank14 server first.
---
for beginner pvp probably shadow priest, but choosing between lock and mage, I'd go mage. However both classes have a pretty high skill ceiling where a skilled player can dominate opponents even when outnumbered, while a weak player is mincemeat against almost every class.
---
Mage is easier to shnie with, as you have massive instant burst and tons of defensive tools.
---
You're only having a blast because you didn't pick alliance. 
---
It's not particularly fun having every flight master dead and your landings perma-camped by a group of 10.
---
God, regular coke is good.
---
This. This fixes everything.
---
It doesn't need to be a perfect 50/50 ratio, but it should NEVER be worse than 60/40. Oh, you want to login. Well your faction outnumbers the other by more than 10%, so you need to wait in this queue until it's your turn.
---
Takes us 3-4 hours. Most people don't use consumes (especially not expensive ones like flasks), and we send our tanks to UBRS for the Fire resist buff before fighting Ragnaros

Yes. God yes. This is just aids. This rank is by far the worst one yet. It's just not fun. Get us into bgs. Please ty
---
also you and your friends prolly should have rolled on a pve server lel
---
What faction do you play?
---
Didn't know it works like you saying, in that case it could be accurate.    
---
Ps: You forgot to quote the whole sentense :) " And even based on these imperfect results(or lets say educated guesses),  the imbalance is not on all servers, it goes both ways and varies from  server to server if H or A. "
---
Most busted class in all regards lol
---
The teldrassil owls don't have screech. The earliest alliance can learn that is from level 17 vultures in Westfall.
---
I played Alliance on Al'Akir in vanilla..
---
Surrounded by players like Klauz, Grim and Guilds like Veterans and Whisky tango Foxtrot.  
---
But also alongside Zalgradis and other PVP players, while levelling up, this was always a nightmare, later this was great because it gave a whole new way of playing..  
---
Now all I see is people complaining how WPVP is unfair.
---
Upvote for no memes plastered over the clip. 10/10
---
It seems you can let another hunter do it for you (as long as only 1 hunter kills it)... It's lame, but if you accept you suck as a hunter...
---
They mask their insecurities by holding onto tired memes. And I say this as someone with enough time on my hands that I could have easily rushed to 60, but chose not to in order to enjoy the leveling experience and still have time for other hobbies and friends. 
---
Phase 2 just means I'll have to delay leveling even longer, but I already know I wouldn't enjoy camping lowbies for insignificant honor every day even if I was on the dominant faction with a level 60 char.
---
We know what leveling has become because we go around farming honor. I haven't played my alts since this started beyond my alchemy alt as it will just get camped even though gray to 60s. 
---
We had a group of 3 60 alliance camping Azshara FP for at least 12 hours on Sunday on Heartseeker. We flew in 5 times to kill them to get our 5 hk limit on them. The only horde in the zone were people leveling. Then at the end of our grinding day we decided to check in again and they were still there. Top person grinding horde side that I've seen was there also sheeping people after flying to kill once honorless was gone.
---
Right, but you'll also have the new expansion to level in and get gear for.
---
I know, so funny! ‘git good’ means I’m horde, I always outnumber alli 3 to 1 and I think I’m good! That is comical
---
It would be a lot better to level as dagger once you have all your CC abilities (Kidney Shot, Cheap Shot, Blind, etc). I think around level 34 you should have all of them.
---
You could also consider a

Even when I was in the mid 50's and had a 60 tank who was carrying our aoe group for all the greens in the dungeons he didnt care if we needed upgrades. And that is the only time I've asked if it was okay in my entire time playing this game, and it was due to a preagreed deal in which he recieved all greens for his work.
---
Talent is inherited? So someone who plays a challenging piece on piano masterfully was born with it? It wasn’t the 10,000+ hours they put in that you didn’t see?
---
What a crock of shit.
---
Gladiator title is something that not everyone can get. R14 is only for no lifers who spend obsessive amounts of hours into the game, no “skill” or “talent” needed
---
Not really. Many people do this sadly. First kill nets no honor.
---
After the respawn the target is at 50% health and easier to kill, netting honor. It's basically setting up a camp.
---
I mean you're completely underestimating the potential of ice block here. You don't use it to sit immune for 10 seconds. You use it to clear dots and cc or to avoid an ability entirely. For example as a hunter Ice block makes a mage go from a free kill to a hard fight. They can simply ice block out of a freezing trap aimed shot multi combo by ice blocking for 2 seconds. 
---
It's such a powerful ability when used property.
---
Even taking into account the additional crit value warlocks get in the stats, mageblade is way better. Paired with the AV offhand in phase 3, it is on par with BWL loot. Some guilds, however, will prio the mageblade to holy palis b/c it is more valuable in terms of raid/guild progression to gear a healer over a warlock or mage when melee and hunters are so much stronger at this stage.
---
So much of the classic wow experience is about interacting with the opposite faction.  Raid scale world pvp, pulling off that 1v2 or 2v3.  Competition for resources and world bosses.  Reputations and competition between opposing faction’s guilds.
---
Neither side will get to experience those on an imbalanced realm.  This is the best time there ever will be to play classic wow and get the full experience.  And instead players on imbalanced realms are pointing fingers at each other and they’re both going to miss it.
---
You don't get honor for the first kill, but you do the next 10 times you kill that same player.
---
The first kill isn't for honor, it's to trap them for the next 10 kills, where they still yield honor.
---
This is IDENTICAL to pservers where horde outnumber alli.
---
Yeah, I leveled with a warlock friend and he used to go nuts on me when we'd barely die to something and I still have my healthstone. He slowly trained me to start using it, and now I've got two Healthstone slots permanently on my bar (one with the talent, for 1440 health, and one without, for I think 1200) even when I'm playing solo.
---
Be careful with the auto clear/targeting.  If you set it to something like mouse wheel fwd, you will be pulling the next pack
---
You are talking about a game where people thinks it's ok to have multiple characters at once. Post something about how multiboxing is cheating and most of the time you get downvoted. Wow community is ridiculous when it comes to these things.
---
It’s probably less about the gear and more about the goals. A level 60 is going to be out in the world for some quick objective, and can stay alert
---
And ready for PvP. A low 50, by comparison, is going to be out in that same zone for the next 8 hours, trying to kill mobs and progress in quests while being systematically killed every 3 minutes.
---
What level are you?
---
I think our very first week2 kill was like 2.3 minutes, it was then that i knew - i won't see a Rag p2 this time around. Was kinda sad.
---
I was shadow up until 54 and gave in and went full fledged holy and I go to searing gorge get a dungeon group and try to run whole of brd you get like a lot of exp so I’ve done it basically once every night and being a healer you get a group INSTANTLY when I hit 60 I might go backshadow, but I enjoy holy now.  It’s not the most glamorous way of leveling but it beats corpse running. Sometimes alliance guard brd entrance so either try to make it as far as possible corpse run and hop in or buy invisibility potions and that’ll make things a lot easier getting in.
---
I got 150 HK's that way yesterday. But I was honestly just afk the entire time. We waited on a few things and a few of our members were bored.
---
You said it yourself, they are camping FPs for no honor. Go where the honor is? And lol rank 14 first wont be for 3 months minimum and bgs will be out well before then.
---
Because they can.
---
This, exactly this. I stopped immediately when... Cata? released, and I was hardcore about the game and loved it and focused on progression, getting rare titles and mounts. When I saw what they were doing with talents that alone was enough for me to quit. I checked in on the shadowlands trailer as WoW Classic is my only exposure since leaving at WotLK end, and it seems they went even further on removing talents and making everyone same-y. I personally hope they drag out classic and then TBC then WotLK and leave it there.
---
Any nameplate addon should do that. Plater, threatplates, neatplates.
---
my TrinketMenu addon is bugged(?) and it won't let me switch out the 2nd slot, when i open it and select an item it only ever changes the slot13 trinket. I have the most recent version updated. wat do
---
How many HK's do you have, if i may ask ?  
---
Because ive heard somebody with 2000HK's but his gained honor was super low, because he only did Hillsbrad.  
---
When i pvp in a group, 100 HK's give me 1000 to 2000 Honor....  
---
The Big Zerg Groups are just for Fun
---
I'm only have 60% blast because i picked horde, would pay 100€ to transfer to ally.
---
You ress, pop invis pot, run away, come back and kill stragglers around the camp.
---
Use your brain retard.
---
&gt; This is what I dont get, what were folk expecting on PvP servers?
---
Easy. More or less the experience I've had in Vanilla. Yes PvP will happen and yes you will occasionally get ganked by ?? which will be annoying. You have to be more aware in contested zones and also get used to play against players which will be different than against mobs. It's thrilling and fun when you with a close fight.
---
But NOWHERE NEAR the current shit show. Getting steam rolled by 10+ lvl 60 groups every 10 to 15 minutes? There's no thrill or competition in this and it certainly isn't fun.
---
So yeah, I was expecting what Blizzard did promise us. The real Vanilla experience or close enough to it anyways. They are currently failing to uphold that promise in a spectacular fashion.
---
Didnt you delete this exact same post yesterday because you said it was for multiboxing and people ripped into you?
---
Oh sorry I didnt mean to Imply not to get it, just that it can be done without an addon. 
---
Sorry for the confusion
---
It’s intellectually dishonest to not accept that there is a distinct difference between PvP happening on a PvP server and the wholesale butchering of everyone at all times.
---
But if I turn off player nameplates they shouldn’t see me... right?
---
I'm just looking at all the people looking for a community in the 2-3 possible servers they have available and not liking how heavily skewed they are to one faction because of Blizzard's poor decision-making in adding transfers early on. Even if this doesn't change anything, I'm sure many people would appreciate it and perhaps if a  lot of people follow along, a snowball affect may fix some imbalances.
---
Population size is just a part of the issue. Blizzard intentionally set it up to over populate servers. I don't hate them for it because I understand their intent. It was a needed risk that played out as a necessary evil.
---
The issue is they compounded the problems it had when they brought the first round of transfers because they played no attention to server balance. Then they did it again with no care to population balance. The second time really caused the most balance issue(especially on the highest pop servers).
---
Now they have tried to bandaid it way too late and people are rightfully frustrated.  It isnt at all entitlement like OP states
---
You realize you can play on diff server to allow queue ?     
---
                   
---
Go see a mage to buff your int mate.
---
&gt; You're projecting too much onto it.
---
One of us is.
---
I get what the OP was trying to do. if he did it during prime hours, it would've capped out at 49. Although its not a good metric of server popularity, it does speak volumes **IMO**  about server health and longevity. The issue we have now with the current PVP system is that while the dominant faction is having a blast ganging up on the other faction, its toxic and detrimental to long term stability and life of the server. What we'll start to see in the coming weeks is that the majority of the lower level players on the dominated side are going to either quit or reroll to a different server. We'll see the population disparity increase over time, eventually getting to the point where one faction (Horde in this case) has an extreme, unfixable majority over the Alliance that'll tank classic PvP servers for  the Alliance.
---
Now granted, I keep hearing everyone say, "But BGs will be cross realm so it'll be okay". I disagree. If every PvP Server has a 70-80 percent horde increase over the Alliance on all PvP servers, that'll bleed into the PvE Realms in those battle groups where a 40/60, 50/50, or 60/40 becomes negligible because those server imbalances will turn those rates more into a 10/90, 20/80, or a 30/70 in terms of people waiting to queue for a BG. Horde are going to still see 30+ minute BG Queues while Alliance will have instant queues. (Ironically, this will be the only good thing that comes out of it for the Alliance) 
---
We'll see what happens though
---
You can't vanish guards unless you get lucky with a los and enough distance...
---
&gt; DR is in effect in TM but there’s still people doing it for 13 hours
---
there's hundreds of players there and new people rotating in and out at all times. DR has a very small impact compared to killing the same exact 10 people for 3 hours straight which makes no sense at all
---

I loved playing, and I loved the natural pvp that came from vying for resources and quest mobs, but the "best" part of the p2 honor system is massive, laggy honor farm battles that are just lines of who can avoid lagging and getting caught in AOE, and the worst part is gank squads sitting in zones for hours on end farming low levels for slow kills. P2 just forced objectiveless world pvp, and ruined the game for tons of casual players for whom bliz forced out DM and p2 waaaaay to early. They are catering to hardcore players who have hours to play every day, and its gonna murder the player base.
---
It's not much greater than pre-bis as ppl have stated.
---
The big nasty upgrade is Ashjre'thul from BWL.
---
This exact reason why I rerolled my paladin to a warrior. I enjoy healing but I want to do damage that doesn’t involved auto attacking.
---
you can do both.
---
Yes, bit seeing everyone with full raid gear made me regret not going faster
---
my problem is not the ganking, but the skulls in groups killing lowbies in lowbie zones is just too much
---
That’s not true. Most specs have one cookie cutter for raids, one for M+, and one for pvp with there being some variance fight to fight. However, they are far more meaningful than literally any talent choice I can think of in classic which is things like increase block %, reduce cast time, and a small handful of abilities. Retail has far far more meaningful choices. The difference in those three fury builds is such a small variation and really it comes down to if you want to go 2H or DW. 
---
The leveling has nothing to do with what I said but alright. 
---
Again, I prefer classic but none of what you said is really a good reason as to why.
---
True.  Just wanted to add that the majority of horde players play on PvP servers while the majority of alliance players play on Normal servers.
---
Warlocks own rogues. They key is don't use curse of agony.
---
Yeah, don't understand the whole crying on here. If you don't want to be farmed by people with skulls or 5vs1, then you should of rolled PVE..
---
I rolled on a PVP server, because that's pretty much the only reason why I ever played WoW. I am "only" lvl 45 and get ganked by lvl 60s at least 2-3 times per gaming session and die 5+ times per gaming session (1-2 hours).
---
I enjoy it. I meet up with other people in my lvl, who are questing nearby and either team up with them, to fight back or try to solo the enemy.
---
I don't always succeed and sometimes have to walk 5mins+ to my corpse, but hey, thats what I wanted
---
as long as they remove all microtransactions and make the classes not boring for pvp, im in
---
Go to the dungeon area then start looking for a group there. It takes me all of 10 minutes tops everyone’s ready writhing 20 and g2g usually. Sometimes it’s dumb. I also don have time to do dungeons if that’s what you’re saying. You kinda have to just find it. Only time I can play is 11pm till like 2
---
I always would 3v1 my friends in Halo and I felt it gave me a huge advantage cuz there were more of them to kill so I could score points faster.
---
Doesn’t apply to rpgs though
---
Transferring a character, yeah
---
What's the best leveling path from 55-60? I've done some of the Felwood quests, most of the early Un'Goro quests, and most of the Tanaris quests already. I haven't visited the plaguelands or done any Winterspring quests yet. I plan to mix in any questing with BRD/BRS runs as well.
---
The main problem I have with it is the communication between players and the fact that it makes something that very few players are willing to do and conveniently packages it into a very user friendly addon that is VERY popular.
---
Why would you think you’d ever get to quest in a zone that has thorium nodes, black lotus, endgame dungeons, that are also situated near major cities? Fucking idiots.
---
That's absolutely correct.
---
It's as it should be and people who are dissatisfied had another wow as their headcanon, most likely from pservers.
---
Go away
---
I'm at around 9 days at level 49, I am on about the same pace as you.
---
How is it a hassle to repsec? You spend your gold, and choose your talents... I would love dual spec but that’s a BC thing (right?)
---
I just want to hit 60 so I can actually hide in stealth in the open world :/
---
Should be entire packs. Usually on the last pack in each hallway. You can see the yells in chat, indicating that mobs are about to come. If you get mobs joining in mid-fight, then it must be the patrols, or someone butt pulled mobs from those small side rooms.
---
That right there is dedication. Derpy dedication, perhaps, but dedication nonetheless.
---
Yeah technically you get honor on the respawn but this is the least effective method of actually gaining honor. You can do this tactic if you don't care about pushing rank and just wanna gank the opposing faction easily.
---
its funny because they picked a pvp server lmaooooooooo
---
I really enjoy the versatility of druids.  Being able to stealth, dps, and tank in the same build is really nice.  I just got tired of not being able to use stuff in bear form like you can in retail (health pots, barksin 20% dmg reduction).
---
But hunter is the one I enjoy the most in classic.  The class's dead zone sucks in pvp but it's really the only issue I see with the class.  Having only 3 maximum pets and only 1 pet active at a time as opposed to retail where you can summon 1 of 5 at any time really creates a bond with the pet and leads to class diversity since each person has their own preference.
---
And if they capped servers this is only more likely to happen across the board.  It looks very much like horde have a massive prevalence on PvP servers.  Capping servers like people keep suggesting would result in virtually every PvP server being horde biased instead of even any being Alliance.  It also mean people would possibly have been unable to play horde because there is simply too many.
---
At that point we'd have bitching 'LOL I WANT TO PLAY HORDE BLIZZARD LET ME".
---
Every single solution result in the players bitching because what they want is not workable unless they are willing to do something they don't want.  Those who don't do what they want get screwed, like you in your case, because not nearly enough people agree to do it.  Either people end up spread across servers too thin and bitch about dead servers.
---
This is still my point.  People don't want a solution that fixes their problem.  People want a solution that forces OTHER PEOPLE to solve their problem.  If 60+% of PvP players want to be horde, someone is going to be upset.  There is no good solution without someone not getting what they want.  There is always bitching.  It's not due to player volume.  I's not due to faction imbalance.  It's not due to whatever else.  The inherent problem is the players wanting everything to work a specific way, which involves them getting exactly what they want but not having to concede anything.
---
Pandering to casuals created retail. Truth hurt. Low ratings @wowretail.
---
I believe this is seppia
---
Imagine thinking it gets any better at level 60. Our raid of very good players still got wiped going to MC last night because 120v40 just isnt going to happen lol. Its part of the game and you just have to laugh it off.
---
the 40 man groups will die out as soon as today (If thats when ranks get dished out) PvPing in a 40 man raid gives next to no honor and isn't worth doing it if you care about ranking or PvP, it's just people jumping on the new hype
---
Tell me about this cleave
---
Useless waste of bandwidth 😂 nah did I fuck her anywhere near rank 6. Didn't have the time. Fair play he got it but just saying that his video to back up his claim is pre-patch. Druids weren't anywhere near that powerful as feral until pre patch. They were good. Not that good.
---
Cheat addon lmao. How? Gimme a situation where its a cheat.
---
I am having a problem with sword specialization - it doesnt seem to affect the dps calculation. Is it broken atm or is something wrong on my end?
---
Yeah man! It is super cool to have someone remember us :P
---
You can still detect it without seeing or hearing it - it's literally in the combat log.  All Spy is, is a GUI for the combat log.
---
Use shift when you loot regularly
---
Drop Imp. Devo, after you get pre-raid BiS for tanking, Devo really won't give you much of an Damage % reduction (basically there's a hidden "armor cap", so as you get near it the reduction in damage drops per 'bit of' armor).
---
I'd go for something like:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031015-053251330201501](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031015-053251330201501) 
---
Unyielding over Imp. LoH, because 10min isn't really going to make a difference; you'll only use LoH twice-ish in a raid, and once in a dungeon run.....unless you're group is reaaaaaaaaally slow. Unyielding works better because there's a 5% chance you won't go running off (like a lil bitch) or wander around (like a drunk). :P
---
Guardian's Favor, because lord knows you're going to need that BoP for that mage or rogue that identifies as a tank.
---
Full Imp. RF, because Threat is Life.
---
Imp. HoJ, because you need something to get to the next tier, and being able to stun more is always a good thing.
---
Reckoning, because you're threat generation comes from Holy Damage, not Physical.
---
Now, aim to be Uncrushable (\~103%; Miss (flat 5%) + Parry Chance + Dodge Chance + Block Chance \[aim for constant, don't rely on Redoubt or Holy Shield\]) but not so much 440 Defense or else Redoubt and Reckoning will pretty much never happen (sitting-crits from mobs apparently are fixed to not trigger these abilities).
---
I think its has everything to do with the culture this generation has grown up on. We know an insane amount about nutrition and sports science that previous generations did not. Most of us value ourselves and the way we look and feel. 
---
But I can see what you mean about competitive mind set making people want to be In shape.

Fitness is a mindset and a lifestyle.

let me guess.. undead?

I played in the original WoW, 2004 through early Wrath.  I loved it, but the game was changed, and it was ruined by Blizz.  
---
I was so excited to play the original again...  But it's not the game itself that sucks this time... It's the player base. 
---
Whining, ganking, loot reserving, pre-BiS obsessed, momma's basement dwelling, 30 year old Try Harders are the core player base this time around. I suspect these are the same kids that were 10 years old in 2005, griefing and ganking as soon as school got out, and throwing tantrums on Friday nights about loot. 
---
Blizz was right, you can't go back... You can't do it all again.
---
I hear a crybaby whining.....
---
I’m sure there’s a lot of people who understand it... my thoughts on it are, people have been 60 and bored forever now and now that there’s something to work towards pvp wise everyone’s lost their minds and are just mindlessly killing everyone because of all the pent up aggression... I do how ever don’t understand the massive groups running around killing everyone, don’t raids fuck with honor? Also it just doesn’t seems satisfying to allergy a few opposing players with 20-40 people... I thought I’d see lots of 5 mans and smaller groups but not was I wrong
---
There are so many bigger problems here than you realize.  Be on a horde dominated server and go try to run any dungeon at 60.  Report back.  Thanks.
---
The mechanical yeti actually does insane damage, use it carefully since when you're out of charges, that is. Pop it on Ragnaros or something (1 mob with alot HP) and you can see how much damage it does over the duration its up.
---
They can ban it and not break it you know. Treat it like a bot.
---
If your guild is up for it, you can do tuesday/wednesday MC raids, that allows you to stay PVP spec for 12 days. And just do Ony in your pvp spec when she resets.
---
I’d be fine if they removed the spy addon. That shit is aids
---
The #nochanges movement is a mess. If people really wanted no changes, they would have demanded 1.1 servers. What they really mean with nochanges, is a version of the game that represents what they personally feel is the best version of Vanilla WoW with some small tweaks that improve playability but are in keeping with whatever they feel is the "spirit of Vanilla". It's all so very subjective.
---
&gt; Bajheera, Swifty, Xaryu, Mufasaprime, Alexensual, fuck even Zyzz played WoW, all stacked and body image focused. While PvE peons like Asmongold and Esfand....................
---
WHO !?
---
okay crybaby mod.
---
EPL on the road from Tyr's Hand to Corin's Crossing.... its hard enough finding a group of 60s and coordinating them for the Scarlet Oracle elite quest, so when a group of 10 a-hole are camping you, its even more enjoyable.
---
Not if they're stealthed. It only tells you if it detects them stealthing, you cannot see through their stealth. That is a big falsity being spread around. Same with it giving coordinates, which it does but they are your position, not the enemies.
---
My biggest problem with it is the affect it has on LoS. I can't put a number on how many times myself or an enemy utilized hiding behind or in something to avoid detection back in vanilla; manhunts were a big part of defending your faction territories. Hiding a raid in a barn in Elwynn was routine procedure. Now you can immediately tell people are there before they even load in. Shit is stupid. 
---
Hide enemy faction information from the log if they aren't actively affecting a member of your fraction.
---
I think you misunderstood.
---
"Questing" usually doesn't entail dungeon quests. It means, doing all regular quests which aren't excessively time consuming or far off the beaten path.
---
If you quest like this (even including elite quests) you will NOT reach level 60 since there are not enough quests in the game. You will starve somewhere shortly before 50.
---
However, you will usually not experience this, because people do all dungeons and most of their quests while leveling. Many people run a lot of dungeons while leveling. Also there is rested xp which adds significant boosts. So for the vast majority of players, this is not an issue. It's just, as I said, trivia which I personally find interesting, because it implies that Blizzard expects you to run dungeons while leveling. If you want to solo quest 1-60, you need to grind up some xp somewhere along the way.
---
A great many of classic talents are pretty unimpactful and only provide anything of significance once you invest the 3/5 points into that are mandatory. Getting these points every level are pretty meh much of the time.
---
The variety in spec is just as limited as retail. For fury warrior, there’s 2 builds. The change between the two is like changing one rotational talent in retail. The flexibility in those builds comes in the lower impact talents that can be interchanged (it’s only a few points). This is no different that changing talents in the “utility” trees in retail, which you can do more freely and have a higher impact in retail.
---
It never did indeed, but that would be a welcome change? A killer wastes time and the victim gets needlessly killed.
---
Im level 47, and while i hate all quest hubs being a instant-kill blood bath, i LOVE running through Feralas, and first see a hugh raid of hordes come storming off the boat to feathermoon, only to see a giant allaince raid on coordinated flightpath arrive to defend it 10 min later, moving to Camp Mojache afterwards, and going back and forth as such. Its so cool
---
Look at the blue pvp set and/or druid T1 to give you an idea of good stats for pvp druid. Stam is most important. Agi/Str is not as important, as normally. Armor is still important.
---
Then if you try to point all of this out, they respond with "git good".
---
Yeah I hate how nobody brings DBM up when talking about add-ons  that should be banned or are op. Dbm trivializes the vast majority of bossfights and makes it so you don't need to know anything about the bossfight, big alerts for important casts, interrupt this ability, range detector so you know to not be close to people. Absolutely dumb
---
If anything pvp should have been in phase 1 so that people didn't level almost all the way to 60 just to find out that they actually don't like pvp servers. If they were getting shit on like this since the beginning, they would have made the switch the first week and not ran into any issues with feeling trapped on a server they don't like playing on.
---
It only takes literally one second for the gank squad to kill a guy.  It’s faster to do that than to look up how many times the gank squad killed him then have a debate on the effectiveness of killing the gankee again.  If you don’t get honor from it, so be it.  It’s quicker and easier to just kill everything.
---
Alliance, Firemaw.
---
It is honestly insane. There are 120 player raids on my server at 3 in the morning.
---
&gt;Yep, there goes your #nochange argument right from the start
---
what do you mean? #nochanges was largely against ChAnGeing the server capacity to ungodly amounts.
---
change leads to more change. thats why we dont want it.
---
this situation right now is EXACTLY why we dont want change.
---
I'm not sure what you consider a "challenge". In PvP battles, it's usually mindless zergs where only ranged and AoE abilities are used while the melee stay back. While you're questing, it's not really a challenge to level or grind and get killed and camped over and over. A challenge suggests that you can overcome it even if it's difficult. But you can't really beat a 10 man death squad camping your corpse. And even if you find a 10 man to counter them, it eventually just turns into a PvP battle so then it derails what you were wanting to do in the first place.
---
You're right. It's an equal effort. So the idea that your effort is worth more than mine is completely self absorbed.
---
At 5/5 Thick Hide takes the 460% armor contribution in bear and raises it to 506%, which does increase physical mitigation buy 3-5% and is not based on RNG like dodge so it is a smoother mitigation as well.
---
Correct, diminishes by 25% for each repeat kill.

Here's the problem, PvP servers are, in general, dominated by horde.  It's very likely that 60+% of people on PvP servers want to be horde.  The only solution is to ban allowing people playing horde at all because there simply are not enough alliance players on PvP server.  Yes there are some Alliance dominated servers, but there are far more horde dominated ones.
---
There is no solution which doesn't result in a different complaint.  Let's say people do go Alliance instead of horde, how long do they play?  How long do they stick around if they wanted to pvp as horde but are stuck as alliance, unable to switch because you need faction balance.  What if the servers are spread so thin to try to prevent dominance of horde that the alliance on the servers is at a minimal amount to potentially even be sustainable?
---
The only thing this is asking for is a guaranteed death of servers within 6 months.  There might be less bitching right now, but there will be just as much if not more later.
---
They aren't disregarding the issue of private servers.  They are making decisions based on how the playerbase as acted in the previous 15 years of the live game.
---
Cool thanks!
---
You've literally had 2 bans for R2 and several removals from several different mods.

Perhaps now would be a good time to reconsider how you interact with people online.

Smolderweb ftw
---
Depends widely on the guild.
---
My guild clears essentially all trash with low deaths no wipes but also no world buffs low consumes and often we don't respec. Takes us about 1½ hours. If we had worldbuffs we could go 1hour ish, and if we skipped then 40-45mins is quite easy for any guild with world buffs and skipping.
---
I heard a rumor once that people are different.
---
Guy above said "raid logging" - what I was referring to. There are many people in my guild only logging on for raid night now.
---
Transfers ruin faction balance. Rerolling is totally in your power. Have fun!
---
No, you can't.
---
&gt; I prefer Murder.
---
FBI? This comment right here.
---
I am pretty much sure people sitting in these gank squads have their own fun. 
---
Catering to casuals (as in non-hardcore players), eventually, has formed the retail wow we have now, not classic. Have you tried it?
---
I like it, I’m on the losing side of an unbalanced server but the battles taking place everywhere are awesome - the world feels alive and dangerous. I probably got ganked 20 times yesterday, but it was fun.
---
\*sighs in boredom\*
---
yeah because everyone does brainless gank squads. Nobody ever wanted good, fast honor gain and went at it solo.
---
If this is sarcasm, its brilliant, but if its serious... I feel sad for you haha.
---
Vanilla and classic are two different beasts. It's far better to compare classic to private servers. On private servers, they specifically released BGs along with honor to prevent this issue. Ganking was still a problem, though.
---
I wouldn't say zero
---
Blizzard opened Horde only transfers to my server, Heartseeker, which used to be heavily Alliance sided. It's still Alliance sided, but it's much more even now and I love it
---
Also, this took Horde away from heavily Horde sided servers
---
What's your spec? What's your gear? What are you doing as your opener?
---
Especially since it was around in vanilla and evolved all the way through legion
---
"But nobody used it!"
---
Someone obviously had to and that's lack of research on your part. Not sleep in the bed you've made.
---
I regret it mainly since now I can't take my time with honor being added :/
---
Yeah if they loved PvP i would have had fights over the last 3 weeks on my new server. I was attacked omce in 3 weeks before honor came out.  
---
Last night I got attacked 15 times. They want the gear not the fun, lol.
---
What does min/maxer have to do with PvP?
---
Why would anyone do anything 'sub-optimal'? Even in the real world when a contractor does something 'subpar' it's because they're trying to min/max their profit on that job.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVuoxZVGthzzvo
---
Is what i did on private servers. Tankedzgand aq20 wity it as well. Most importany thing is threat. Id also recommend going full holy with rest into prot. Holy shock is amazing for single target threat abd is great for pulling. if you ever have problems with aoe threat just throw a nade or get engi shield.
---
Focus on gear with high stam and intand mp5. Defense isnt really important for 5/10mans. Your ultimate goal is 8/8 t1. The set bonus is insane threat ajd helps the run go faster cuz your healer doesnt have to spend as much healing other players.reckoning only makes it even more insane
---
Really recommend getting helm of narv if you havnt gotten t1 or 2 helm.
---
Literally who?
---
Remember how hard they tried for BFA to be like this? And yet it was the biggest flop ever.
---
Good eye! You seem to be correct
---
People need to activate their PvP tag. Thus people will just go and meet up in Hillsbrad to fight some consentual PvP.
---
In some classes you may have a few free talents that you can move around, but they are generally very low impact. Most of the time, significantly more than many of the lowest in retail. You might as well not even have those points at all.
---
Try learning to be a human before interacting with other humans.
---
I think the problem is that servers are way bigger than they were in vanilla. There's just too many people everywhere. Not sure why they made servers so large over having more smaller ones.
---
Mage being free kill versus a hard fight is entirely dependent on how far from the mage you are when you are starting the fight. If mage can get into your melee range you are done, he will just AE you down.
---
enjoy the boredom on lvl 60
---
They do. Which is why most people will never get high ranks. Your honor gain in a raid is only as good as the average member's performance. You'd get much faster honor gain by being exceptional on your own
---
Are you Alliance of Horde?
---
Have you been to the Hinterlands?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the problem seems that in Vanilla you didn't have this many people who were both lvl60 and knowledgeable about the game. I for one don't recall so many lvl60's three months after launch.
---
Hey man, I'm in a server 1st guild and on the dog packs in MC the mages are only slightly higher than the warlocks. ~1k DPS vs ~750 dps. Hellfire is pretty OP as long as you don't pull aggro with it lol
---
No you can't, then you would be playing on a PvE server. Stop trying to make PvP something it isn't. It's unfair and more often than not by people vastly outnumbering you. Always been like that, always will be like that.
---
On Skeram where it’s heavily Horde favored alliance hold several locations constantly and break through Horde raids despite being outnumbered. It’s definitely harder for Alliance but it happens every day in multiple zones.
---
I don't want to but it's another argument against it
---
Please blizzard listen to this man.
---
HASHTAG NO CHANGES
---
I'm solo
---
I’ve always enjoyed pvp when it’s level appropriate. 20s going red is dead is fun when going against other 20s. Same with other zones, when it’s level appropriate. I refuse to participate in the lowbie gankfest that this has turned into. 
---
My gripe with classic is because there are so many people on one realm, you have loads of 60s spilling into lowbie zones out of boredom/frustration. Those are the people who aren’t looking for pvp fun. They are looking to be assholes and to ruin other people’s fun for whatever reason. Misery loves company I guess.
---
I'm sure the Horde on my server (Benediction) are also having the time of their life effectively locking Alliance players out of the game by camping every boat, flight path &amp; dungeon run in the entire game.
---
I'm sure you wouldn't be having the time of your life if it took you nearly (or sometimes more than) an hour to get from a FP to the dungeon you want to run because the opposing squad literally has 100 people camping the entire area.
---
30er raid group camping a flight master isnt pvp imo. I dont even get how people can do this for several hours, seems boring as fuck. The only reason all are doing it is to farm honor points - not because its fun.
---
Transferring a character, you will keep your fps
---
Ok how about : too little too late?
---
I know right!
---
Putting out BGs in 2 weeks is *changes* . This is a vital part of the vanilla experience right now
---
Do Scarlet Monastary runs.
---
I've never had a mobile auto correct so actively work against me like this one.
---
&gt; As for solutions I don't have any. It's agreeable that splitting servers to try and find a more Vanilla population is potentially dangerous long-term with player drop off. Layering existing servers will not sit well either. I suppose all I'm suggesting is that people take a more civil tone with those complaining, as when you look at the facts this isn't something that anyone could conceivably envisage when looking to hindsight for reference. 
---
The only feasible solution is probably for Blizz to release WSG early for those who want to PvP constantly.
---
Faction specific server transfers is a decent measure, but it is in no way a solution. Most people will not give up an advantageous situation for an uncertain situation. 
---
Anything else would probably have to be community generated. Right now everyone is acting in a selfish manner, because it is a wild scramble to get on top of the Honor ranking. It would be up to the community to make sure that the server does not end up as single faction.
---
It depends on the time of day and your server. On the massive servers raid vs raid is the only option.
---
In the early morning I'll solo and get about 1500 an hour because there are no other groups. Later in the day I switch to 3 man because I'm likely to run into others. At peak hours it devolves into raid vs raid.
---
Actually the pserver community was very outspoken ahead of time about how server population would affect phase 2. Most of the people I find complaining about it's current state are casual players who can no longer level their characters due to the extensive ganking across every zone. As someone who's on the underdog faction, I feel bad for those who arent geared and ready for wpvp because even on my main, I run into 5-10mans or even full raids of players in every contested zone I can find. Luckily, im also there to pvp so its not so rough for me.
---
I call bs on that server balance.
---
i disagree. you could perfectly balance the realms and people would still have their own play styles and less pvp centric people would still gravitate towards alliance so you'd still see horde in groups more.
---
Just invite people to group with you.
---
Talk to people on your class' Discord or talk to raiders on your server directly.
---
Maybe your server pop is relatively low, and/or the majority of players have lvld beyond STV. Or maybe you play at odd server times, or maybe you're a druid or rogue, but I've gotta tell ya, it's unplayable as an alliance warrior in Tanaris.
---
After getting killed solo for eternity, I (45 warrior) grouped with a 43 hunter and paladin to try and take control of a small area of quest mobs. From a pair of dickhead shamans that were ganking.  We started out by minding our own business hoping our numbers and the fact that we were obv working together would deter most, nope.  The pair of 44 shamans must have called for help, because not long after they saw us they were joined by a ?? Warrior. The 3 then waited for us to pull mobs before jumping us. We lost, killed a shaman, and the ?? Moved on. We of course murdered the shammies and quested until the warrior came back. Almost killed him but a 48 mage rogue pair showed up and camped us. Add onto that a sizable gy run and I'm done.
---
To sum up: The horde flocked and an hour and a half later the quest still isn't done. Fuck it.
---
I mean really, while it _looks_ worse only having to choose 7 talents, those are actual _talents_ that are abilities. Realistically you're only going to get about 3 abilities using the classic talent tree, and that's if you put most of your points in one tree.
---
Yeah god forbid people use addons to get things that should already be a part of the baseline UI
---
Eh. Still not worth the time. I did provoke slightly. But, whatever lol.
---
I did on an alt yesterday on a popular server.  Had no issues.  Just avoid the mass fight and you'll be fine.
---
&gt;I don't think I have it easy :)
---
You definitely have it better than Alliance players who are not in APES, considering Gehennas is Horde-favoured.
---
Thats what you get for rolling on a PVP server.
---
&gt;This isn't PvP, this is gankfest
---
According to you guys (PVP realm players), "ganking" and "gankfest" IS WPVP, so why are you complaining? Isn't this what you expected?
---
What’s the reo? How much time have you   Spent farming?
---
this will work, but have fun getting to SM
---
it audibly announces the spells that they cast. if you watch the clip you hear the rogue cast "vanish, sprint, blind"
---
thanks dude
---
Yes.  Each kill suffers a 25% diminishing return, until the 5th kill is worth nothing.
---
It's also desirable for casters as there aren't any decent enchants for them atm
---
Agreed.  As a holy paladin, I'm in the same boat.  I have a bubble-hearth option though, but that's it.
---
One of the individuals in your list was talking how posting screenshots of them killing Ragnaros in Classic was fake, because the real one was in vanilla and it has no merit.
---
...while posting pictures of him all roided up in Twitter.
---
So I was right, it does what I said, looks in the combat log for enemy players by looking at damage, buffs and etc. (what you said).  
---
Either the average redditor doesn't know what etc. means or I'm missing something here, I don't understand why my comment was downvoted when it's literally the same thing.
---
they are from 2006 and incorrect
---
^ This guy hasn't played Horde on Heartseeker
---
Oh yeah, I felt like I couldn't do that until like lvl 50 when tanks started getting better and more capable.
---
Druids should receive buffs that never make them more relevant than they are now, so this sounds pretty okay
---
All these people who quit within 4 days would've quit in 4 days over something else. Please blizzard don't cater to these people. Take your time and release the BG's when they're ready and bug free.
---
I remember starting my first ever character, a troll mage. I barely completed that quest where you have to kill some orc warlock after dying a bunch of times (dark storms?), said fuck it and rerolled a hunter. Once I got my pet it almost felt like cheating.
---
Yes, for MC. Onyxia is on a 5-day cycle.
---
Dire maul courtyard is my fav place atm, smart LoS and only 2 fast ways out :)
---
It's hilarious to read about all these salty kids that have quit classic because PVP servers turned out to be exactly what we expected them to be.
---
So glad I rolled PVE server. Best of both worlds, fuck loads of WPVP, thats OPTIONAL.
---
Remind me In 6 Hours
---
Youre right its something thats available to every character and every class in the entire game.  
---
sounds pretty balanced to me homie.
---
I’ve stopped played thanks to this garbage. My buddy was ganked inside storm wind from a 3 man stealth team over the weekend. He stopped playing also. 
---
Fuck this crap. This didn’t happen in vanilla. I WAS THERE!
---
but what if it hacks your computer and takes control of your account like every other addon that cheaters download?
---
I don't know about the math behind it. It's probably just what you said.
---
Though i think if you have a party of 10 or so and you keep the respawns killed immediately it stacks up fast. Or atleast it should.
---
being healthy = feeling better = performing better, body and mind are not separate, they work better when both are given attention
---
It really depends on the item. Most of the time it's not going to be that big of a deal. 
---
There are some exceptions however, e.g. if a hunter rolls need on Hand of Justice vs a melee dps, that's something that needs to be discussed before hand.
---
Ranking mafia impacts like 2% of the population. World pvp impacts waaay more
---
That gear comes from BG reputation.
---
Lolumad
---
That question is actually rather easy to answer, since it is the same for all casters and healers: BRD.
---
lol
---
Take South entrance lol
---
I've tried out a few things and I agree with the majority who say Arms is the way to go.
---
You basically need to max out Tactical Mastery and get Anger Management. You're not really playing your warrior correctly with out these essential points.
---
I leveled purely in dungeons after I hit 16. I tried 11 points in arms and then moving into prot. It wasn't worth it.
---
You don't need the extra suitability or threat from prot talents and you miss out on all the dps benefits.
---
So the standard Arms build is 100% the way to go. Go axe spec as you'll get loads of great 2h axes from dungeons if you do end up tanking.
---
I've recently switched to the arms/prot hybrid build as BRD, DM and LBRS are quite hard to do and the extra suitability and threat is now needed for the first time
---
I know this isn't the point of the screenshot, but man... Download bartender.
---
&gt; I believe some players will try to do their part and also right their wrongs.
---
lmao
---
That is a fair point, for servers where both factions are active, the war effort can be done quite quickly. Some serious guilds are probably already stockpiling mats for it on bank alts.
---
It would only be an issue if one faction is almost completely eradicated.
---
i missed Telling that im alli, but thanks
---
You can click their name in the window and the addon just calls "/t player-name"
---
Haha maybe not exactly plate rogues but, holy power feels just like combo points to me. I have no doubt that it’s hard to design secondary resources but I can only hope classes are cooler in shadowlands
---
Sounds like a more complicated way of saying you want Wpvp on your terms to me, but agree to disagree I guess.  The populations and phases were well known ahead of time, you chose to roll pvp anyway.  I guess cancel your sub or adapt.
---
I just hit level 53 on Skeram, a server that was deemed toxicly imbalanced in favor of the horde.  For the last week or so its been nearly impossible to quest for more than 15 minutes in a level appropriate zone without being steamrolled by roaming groups of Allies farming honor.  
---
I get that guerilla hit-and-run tactics are pretty much your only option when you're out numbered.  But holy shit man, when this happens I just don't even want to bother logging on.
---
All these same wpvp complaints are so tiring. Reroll on PvE if PvP bothers you so much. The other faction gets killed too
---
Faction specific queues would still work... You can play horde, you just have to wait in a queue until enough horde players logoff. 
---
No one is saying that servers need to have a perfect 50/50 ratio, but I don't think they should ever get worse than 60/40.
---
Then why are you on a pvp server?
---
&gt;I don't think I (or anyone) should have to research all the BiS items for all classes
---
I don't think anyone should *have* to either, but you will become familiar with the chase items of each class/spec once you get to end game dungeons.
---
With you being a Warrior tank, the lines get fuzzy between what items are BiS, cause you have to balance mitigation with threat generation.
---
Here is a list from wowhead classic, its not set in stone but it is a good guideline.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow)
---
As a healer it’s nice to have in strat live, if we AoE pull one (esp late in the fight) I can just zap it and it goes away. Saves time / mana. In the rare pinch, like a bad pull, can save from a wipe. And I’m not wanding much anyways when healing a 5 man.
---
yeah it's called high test
---
more testosterone = more competitive
---
Depends on the item, but for recipes or blue items somewhere in the ballpark of 4-16 hours.
---
I'm on a fairly 'balanced' server so either die about 10 times or don't die at all, depending on the faction in control at the time.
---
p2 is a shitshow considering most servers are MUCH more populated than they were in vanilla, and the playerbase is much better too!
---
I'm level 60, so you missed on both opportunities.
---
 [https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table) 
---
In short:
---
300-305 reduces your yellow hitcap from 9% to 6%, so essentially you gain 3% hit.
---
300-305 reduces penalty of glancing blows from 35% to 15%
---
305 - 308 reduces penalty from 15% to 5%
---
Anything above 308 does not reduce glancing blows and the hit gain is very insignificant. 
---
Weapon skill also reduces enemys dodge chance following the formula:
---
    If the target is a mob:     DodgeChance = 5% + (TargetLevel*5 - AttackerSkill) * 0.1%
---
    
---
Which means any weaponskill reduces dodge chance by 0.1% up until 315 weapon skill.
---
As someone who started on PvP servers in Vanilla and played on them through most of retail, the problem is NOT the server type. The problem is the both the faction imbalances and the toxic ganking culture that was cultivated on many Private servers.
---
PvE servers have no problems. Sorry you got "bullied into rolling on a PvP streamer realm with your friends"
---
It makes a huge difference. The world doesn't scale to the amount of players.
---
Yeah but have you TRIED cherry vanilla coke?
---
idk if I'd call constant corpse running fun, but I'm glad you're enjoying yourself
---
Those of us that played on pservers know exactly how this will go. People no life this game, people will no life pvp to hit rank 14 ASAP and those people will be grinding anything they can for honor. 
---
Even when BG's release, the faction that does not get instant-queues will que in the major city, and travel the world farming HK's while they wait on the queue. This is identical to what happened on the psevers. They need honor and BG queues are too long for one faction to grind the honor they need / want.
---
Got ganked so hard it killed his sub 
---
I didn't ether so i joined a guild, and made some.
---
It does sound like you should have from the get-go. It’s certainly not for everyone.
---
I'm pretty sure a lot of people who actually played the game 15 years ago saw this coming. No one wanted artificial lag or a ton of shit delayed pointlessly, except people who live vicariously through patchnotes and thottbot comments written 10 years before they were born.
---
I'm fine with that, so long as faction imbalance is being addressed.
---
Yeah I got rid of wand and went holy disc no I don’t have spirit tap either. Inner focus and basically main heal stuff I looked up the build online but chose a couple different. Healing was okay as shadow, but holy shit. In holy all I do is cast a renew hit heal or greater heal once from half life and they’re good to go. My mana doesn’t deplete nearly as quick. It’s beautiful and ever since I have switched every group I’m in praises my healing. Like oh you’re a god at healing. I’m like bitch I have to click like two buttons but I’m not gonna let you know that
---
Item scamming, cheating and gold selling was a thing in vanilla
---
The arcanite bar transmute is from the vendor in gadgetzan and not on a timer, you can buy as you please. The only finite recipe from the alterac vendor is frost oil, iirc.
---
Because the hunter can also have the addon and has the same information available to him for you.   
---
You both know the other person is generally in their vicinity. Id argue thats more fair than a hunter tracking you but you not knowing where they are yet that is OK because its a class ability not an addon.  
---
If you think a hunter tracking you is fair play because its a class ability but everyone having all the information of their combat log available to them is somehow unfair idk what to tell you.  
---
as a priest you can literally watch your combat log - see the enemies name - /tar him and cast mind vision and know exactly where he is with all the same info. Spy just makes it popup.
---
You could say his biggest fault was that he was too *deadicated* to the fight
---
I have a blast. I am a rogue so this game has turned into an MGS stealth clone for me.
---
You can use abbreviations and still RP.
---
 IRL people don't have text bubbles coming out of their head either.
---
yeah, its literally the best strategie. Even if i dont do it intentionally, it usually works. Even had people being sorry for murdering someone innocent (folks who genuinly wanted a fair fight and were the same level as me, just didnt know that i'm not down for a battle)
---
There are no transfers from pvp to pve right now. Your only option is to reroll and start over.
---
*Dies of boredom*
---
FTFY lol
---
Take it back dagger ears
---
No god, please more soundbits for a meh video.
---
Half the time, I too am dealing with this.
---
Fair. I haven’t looked back in... 5-7 years whatever it’s been, but yeah once they gutted the talent treees I was out. I liked the choice, even though I was very min/max focused as a mt healer for progression. Got that Val’anyr son haha
---
This summarizes how braindead most horde are
---
Probably Strat UD but that is just based on my experience and not a fact.
---
For a non-whiney answer: Scarlet Monastery and its associated quests are great. Though the entrance is always contested. Travel in with your group!  
---
I would also prioritize zones that are heavily contested, vs zones that are not. I know that sounds odd, but you are more likely to have allies around you in the more contested zones. The gank squads that are looking for easy kills are specifically hunting the "out of the way" places, and this seems to be something most folks are not realizing.  
---
Prioritize: Dustwallow, STV, Hillsbrad + Arathi  
---
Avoid: Desolace, Thousand Needles  
---
The emergent gameplay of this game right now is really incredible and unique if you're willing to pace yourself and realize that you can't play in the most optimal way all the guides online say. You *have* to get creative!
---
Again, People said this would happen, maybe a pvp server just isnt for you. If you actually wanted to level up and join the fun you could just spam Instance untill 60, you need the gear anyway
---
Yeah I know there’s no XP gain from BGs, but they can still be really fun. If I need to be in a capital city, I usually think it’s a good tome for a few battlegrounds haha. 
---
Yeah, I remember twinks lol. Not every fight will be balanced, of course. Some BGs will have your team getting steam rolled. Not so different than getting floored by a ganking squad or getting ran down by a 60 on his epic mount haha.
---
“Lol 4 times” -Alliance of Skeram
---
Yes, but it's going to go down significantly.  There are plenty of people who are not going to grind for R14 who are in gank squads right now.  Those people will fall off.
---
You couldn't fly in old Azeroth in TBC dude... Also, most people did not have an epic flying mount through most of TBC.
---
are you a genius video gamer?
---
Join us brother... Spread the message of the barn to the masses. It requires some small things to consider and good positioning but if done right do it 2 or 3 times and their overpopulation will thin out. We just use this when they  start zerging us just because they are more... That quickly dies down after then barn :3
---
Did that the other say on Heartseeker, my group ended up disbanding because our Rogue was the only one who managed to reach the dungeon in like 2 hours of getting assraped by Allies.
---
High-end players: Wants discussions and not low effort memes

---
I'm not sure what posts like this aim to achieve other than create yet another "not a circlejerk!" circlejerk.
---
How exactly are some randoms on reddit, casual or experienced, going to change the scheduled updates Blizzard has in mind, for better or for worse? I'm newer so please explain this to me.
---
I just find it quite telling that it took one user 5 threads and a heaping tablespoon of pathos (read: self-pity) to get a thread that gains traction.
---
You get the info from looking at their animations. Target and nameplate cast bars are essentially a quality of life change that evens out the playing field. Makes the info more easily accessible.
---
Hammer + DM N oh, but in reality stats so close not that big of deal. When you get 500+ healing u don’t run out of mana before MC fights end if you are downranking correctly.
---
Sure but he asked for something it would break. Also you wouldn't be able to see hostile healers either.
---
... you cant buy it from blizz ... Didn't think I had to explain the difference.
---
You should play Ally on Skeram or Stalagg! :)
---
thank you!
---
&gt; First, this is something you would have to implement ONLY on big servers because doing it on the smaller servers would be death.
---
Of course. This would only apply to servers where one faction outnumbers the other by more than 20%. Other obvious stuff like minimum number of players and yada yada. It's possible.
---
&gt; Secondly, this wouldn't stop people from bitching, only change what they are bitching about. It will becomes people bitching that they can't get on at peak times or for raids even if they want to do shit other than pvp.
---
That is fine. They will have the option to server/faction change. So they can play as soon as they choose. The players who are stuck on realms where they are severely outnumbered have no choices except for rerolling.
---
I too wish blizzard still had census data. Since they don't offer it anymore the next best data is the censusplus addon. You are correct in that at least some servers are so lopsided that horde outnumber alliance almost 4 to 1. On Skeram at level 60 it's like 27% alliance compared to 73% horde.
---
Rank yes, honour no.
---
The amount of ranking points you gain is based on the amount of honour you accumulate compared to the average player. The cap on ranking point gain is being in the top 0.3% of players the way I understand things.
---
So if the 2nd best player has 1000 honour, and the best player has 10,000 honour, anything past earning 1001 was wasted. They will still gain the same amount of rank.
---
The second cap is a bit nebulous in how it works to me. You're capped at gaining 1 rank per week after hitting rank 3, and the way I've seen people talk about it makes it seem like any rank points past your newly gained rank are deleted? 
---
Either way, that only really "matters" in ranks 10+ if I'm remembering correctly. All of the ranks below that you can earn enough ranking points to clear from one rank to the next in a single week.
---
Sounds like some is mad they didn't role a lock.
---
"And what Loa do YOU bargain wit'?"
---
Add a change to stop death balling? For example honor is reduced exponentially depending on how many of the same faction is *nearby*
---
In the Wendigo cave?
---
I'd just be happy if they let me kill what I'm attacking first before they wreck me. At least let me have a little xp
---
Clearly Horde.
---
Definitely sounds like a low key advertisement.
---
For sub level 55 BRD I always did up to the bar and called the run done. Sometimes we would just end after the arena event. After level 55 I started pushing towards the end, and cleared the entire dungeon at 57 or so. 
---
If you take BRD in chunks it really helps. It also makes it feel like more than one big instance.
---
Found the guy who just follows whatever reddit says.
---
That's only true for raiding. Balance pvp is very strong. Especially balance/ns
---
Agree. I used to love reddit but I've grown to hate the community with a passion. There's so much whining, circlejerking and the same joke comment chains on every goddamn post.
---
Atleast in the big subs it's that way, especially the gaming ones.
---
Download it and use it. 
---
I'm a rogue and I'm not of the mentality "if you cant beat them, join them".
---
Hopefully the more people that use it will highlight it
---
If you're only getting killed 2-3 times on the way to BRD then your experience is not theirs and you can just fuck off with that attitude.
---
Try dying every single time you engage a mob in EPL.  Try dying 15+ times on the way to BRD.  Try spending half an hour to get on the flight point in fucking AUBERDINE because a horde is camping the FP.
---
There's no way this is fun.  You can't do anything.  You can't progress at all.  The only way to win is to not play.
---
this is very much my feelings as well. i enjoyed my pvp server prior to last week.
---

---
You do get honor, because in the chillwind post and Morgans Vigil are NPCs. You MC the newcomer, have him hit an NPC, therefore being honorless for 30seconds goes straight out the window. 3seconds after landing, people are worth honor.   
---
That's why I run around with a shaman and priest. Priest for dispells, great heals and MC. Shamans for great ranged burst and WF for my BRE. We take on anything from 1 to 6 players easily.

I hope you got rid of all the hot air inside you
---
Azshara is pretty magical. 
---
At what time you grind is the most important factor though.
---
Being met with 5 different raids of horde trying to get from thorium point to brd is a challenge? There's nothing hard with ghostwalking, it's just tedious. Before phase 2 it wasn't necessarily easy, but it could be a good fight. Now you either raid up or get farmed, there is no middleground.
---
Or when they just life tap after a fight to get mana, and just stand there waiting for heals. Like bandage, eat or drink man.
---
I answered an LF tank and heal SM Cath on my priest to find 3 warriors already in group...
---
Mage. I do tend to have a cloaking device and a couple stacks of invisibility potions for getaways, however. I'm sure a 100% mount with all the speed boosts helps me as well.
---
*looks at the class tag*
---
Yeah, I see why you think that.
---
Pride blinds its holder.
---
I joined a pvp server to play with my friends / guildies.
---
Everyone quit about the time I hit 30.
---
It's not like server transfers were never a thing back then anyway.
---
Elitest nerd with deck out 60? /gasp
---
Make Level 1s on a few servers and type in chat /who 60
---
Whisper them and ask, I've had people whisper me and I have no problem with answering a few questions
---
Explain what a melee class does in this scenario?
---
Hope you like drinking... It's not bad. Just a lot of drinking. I don't use conjured water from x5 to x0 because it's below what you can buy
---
Please tell me what aren't highly contested areas for 55-60?
---
Once you have a mount &amp; ice-barrier, you shouldn't get hit. Before that, wanding and body pulling is quite effective. If that's 10 mobs, you will take damage. If you only make pulls of a few so you don't get hit you lose so much effectiveness by needing to drink the same amount as if you had 20 mobs in a pull.
---
Makes sense, Generals after that and thats where it started to get hard
---
You could make an argument that getting good includes picking a class/race with good synergy, and not picking fights you are bound to  lose.
---
Isn't sending your pet onto prey how you hunt with pets IRL?
---
Hopefully they come soon
---
I agree with most arguments here but i also noticed that some people do not understand that you can roll Need for an item which is not your BIS. Of course looking for Bis is always good but it seems that some people do not understand that i might roll need on an item that is not my BIS just because there is a stat increase.
---
Everything is an us vs them in WoW these days.
---
Look at this fucking boomer haha.  
---
PvE is for fgs bro
---
They could do a metric assload of smaller servers I guess,  but I have no idea how feasible that is.
---
Yeah I'm sure you would have loved not being able to play with your friends because of faction balance restrictions
---
The population size is an issue on PvE servers too. Mining and herbalism nodes tuned to 3k population rates is a prime example of this.  I'm a warlock and can solo dungeons, so nbd farming thorium and ghost mushrooms. Black lotus is going to be an issue for later raids, though, assuming there isn't a huge drop in population.
---
It gives you a game of hot and cold on the map that ruins wpvp. And it still ruins going into shadowmeld. The addon is a cancer
---
Oh, duh XD well, that's one I didn't think of! How do you deal with satyr? Top up, renew, Shields and dispel SW:P? Shield and renew probably help with Sac
---
And with a warrior do quests that wants you to kill mobs in same level as you or lower. If you are going to kill mobs 1-2 level higher than you, you'll have a really bad wasted time.
---
Just get in dungeon clearing groups until your level meets the quest mob levels.
---
The amount of honor you gain for a kill is based on the damage you/your party/your raid dealt to the target. 
---
If you just jump in with a fire blast at the end, you don't get much honor.
---
If you are in a party/raid, the honor the party/raid gains is divided evenly.
---
Wowhead has a rundown of the mechanic.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview)
---
Such an impatient group of people man - its been FOUR DAYS of p2. FOUR DAYS.   
---
Four days into launch it was still impossible to log into the fuckin game - How about we give p2 like a week or 2 and then we can see where its at
---
dots and hellfire?  are those mage skills?  i only know shadowbolt
---
If they are sitting in the room of an inn afk with passive abilities writing to the combat log, you'd be able to read that.
---
It’s allowed except on PvP server IIRC.
---
I replied to the wrong post i think
---
Yup, like Saturday right? I was there for a bit.
---
Nah imo this sub has always wanted a true vanilla experience. Am I enjoying this myself? Yes. Is it a true classic wow experience? Not even a bit.
---
They get lfie drain for sake, if you playing afflic you get life syphon too, I fail to see why they can't, but as I main resto druid, I tend to make it know when I play my lock to let the healer know I'm not a prio heal target.
---
The fuck are you talking about? Just log out at an instance and run it to level instead of getting ganked while doing non instanced content. 
---
How is that not reflective of anyones experience? He's not claiming it to be reflective of anyones experience, just stating that it is a good way to circumvent the aforementioned problems.

---
If you want to, then yes it's worth.
---
Being level 60 on a realm where you don't enjoy yourself, and have no friends/guild, doesn't sound "worth"
---
I mean, if a rogue opens on you, are you really picking the fight?

... as someone who has horde and ally on Kromcrush it is as bad as he’s making it out to be. And you getting “camped” by alliance is laughable to what horde does to ally on Kromcrush. You don’t have any idea because you don’t see the red names at every alliance FP/town/GY.
---
If you have the patience and a bit of luck, you can solo farm for this with decent lvl 60 5 man gear. So far I've only been able to solo the dinos since they have a ranged caster attack which you resist a lot. It most certainly would be more efficient with a partner or 2, where you can kill all the adds every time.
---
I attack the dinos from a ledge inside the arena that they can't path up to (on the right after you jump down, explore, you'll see it), but range can still range attack you. This makes the melee-only mobs evade, which is partially why I can't solo the other rounds (no luck with scorps, bats, bugs, etc).  There's a 50/50 chance that the dinos will be ranged or melee dinos, but as long as at least 1 is ranged you can figure it out with sheep / nova etc. You need to aggro them all within 2 mins of spawning, or else they deaggro and you fail the event. As long as one is sheeped however, it keeps the timer at bay.
---
Then \_if\_ the boss spawns, I was able to solo him with a single-target frost spec, \*dampen magic\*, and some health pots. For subsequent runs, I bought some greater arcane protection potions which I think will trivialize this a lot, whenever I died I was dying with boss \~10%, so just needed a little extra time. The luck part of this is getting the dino + mage combo, so shooting for this you will hit the instance cap very quickly. Use alternate account / friend to reset while you're logged off to put you back at beginning of instance.
---
As far as I can tell, there's no correlation between round 1 adds and round 2 boss. For a while I thought the dinos were linked to the Ogre, but just did a run proving it wasn't true (got Dinos + Grizzle).
---
I watched a few hunter videos of them soloing in different ways, biggest help here is the pet / fd combo that they can use to prevent evade in various ways (I bet warlock could solo a bit more easily because of pet / instant dots). To make this a very reliable mage method to farm this belt, it would help if someone could find a way to reliably kill more of the round 1 mobs, because then this would become incredibly easy to farm since the boss is reliably doable with the arcane pots (maybe will take a try or 2 w/ a string of lucky crits, but definitely possible).
---
Da wa awesome
---
Yeah, WPvP is fun, what ends up happening most of the time is similar to why I never liked the PVP in RvR games... just a aoe splody fest. 
---
I generally enjoy small scall WPvP though, 5-10 people hammering on each other where non AoE skills are useful.
---
Typically the worst players tend to be the dps classes, especially nowadays where the meme of just started blastin is very accurate. As a main tank I have to remind newer raid members to chill out on dps. This isn't retail where threat isn't an issue. Dps shamans using earthshock...
---
This is true, but they also probably know how many people came back to play and are willing to just quit again.  There was a huge sub growth and those are people who aren't playing retail so they have quit before and they'll do it again.
---
I’m not. This patch is awesome on Kromcrush.
---
You're nonetheless very right. Almost every CLASS in retail is able to kick, cc, heal themselves, etc.
---
And I totally forgot about ret combo points hahaha whereas I did main a Ret in BFA. Smh.
---
Let's hope shadowlands brings more class identity.
---
All my friends who play warlocks are big noobs who love to troll. One of my best friends loves to just spam lifetap on his lock on both classic and retail.
---
In retail I can just put a rejuv on them, but in classic I just let him die and laugh.
---
How do they not have jobs?
---
It's because you chose alliance at the character screen
---
twinks are low level, a lvl 60 is just an alt
---
Absolutely this. We've been looking for another officer to fill an empty spot, but I told the other officers "if i don't recognize their voice in discord, I don't want them as an officer"
---
Server, Faction, battleNet # to contact you would help.
---
Or just change honor gain from 12 to 7 lvl diffrence. So 60 gains honor from 53+ not 48+
---
Level of npc doesn’t matter, they need to be marked a civilian to give a dk.
---
I wonder if they'll stay level 53 forever just so they can feel morally superior because they didn't *rush* the game.
---
No, it tells you the last coordinates where a combat action was taken, not their current location.
---
Firemaw is bigger =)
---
Yep!
---
Something like this?
---
    /use [@mouseover,help,nodead][@target,help,nodead][@player]Remove Lesser Curse
---
casting bar addons should also be removed from vanilla.
---
Buff addons if those are a thing, that was a mage spell in vanilla.
---
Druid is literally 1 spell simulator until 54
---
Yeah people get on their alt and troll in trade chat.
---
Dude A clown. Don't waste your time
---
Stop trying to ride someone else's coattails.
---
Is rag that easy? My guild didn’t have the water, so we summoned 1 person who doused everything. We then got rag to 6% before his second phase. Is it that nerfed?
---
I'm 60 with bis and am having no problems at all. Because I only log in for an hour or two a week to clear raids and then there's nothing left to do
---
I saw him near the mailbox, just add him to friends
---
Yep, get rid off castbar, buff addons and mob HP addons as well. Thx
---
Exactly, that's what I do too. PvPers are going to do this till the end of time.
---
On a PvP server? The former.
---
Can you provide a link? The last info I saw was 2 weeks after launch when they broke the api to prevent census addons from working. As a result I cant find any credible data.
---
I know, I'm doing the same. I can still argue to find ways to get it removed.
---
Butthurt.
---
You might be right, but that is just a question of defining an level 60 twink/alt as either of both. It does not change the actual point.
---
Horde mage lel
---
What casting bar add on is that?
---
Probably one of the most fun class to do solo things, it's also a great class to gather ressource since you can go wherever you want in a dungeons with FD
---
So they were in vanilla.
---
i like it so far. some guildie is getting raped in WPL, calls us for help and suddenly our entire guild is commiting genocide over there
---
CoR is for the weak....
---
/L2kite and do mech.
---
*psst, hey.
---
A bat has the same stat profile as an owl and the ability to learn screech just like the teldrassil owls do.*
---
Because it's more convenient?
---
You don't? They just got rid of them.
---
Aw, I'm already horde on Pagle...
---
&gt;No but only fighting when you have the advantage of numbers and waiting till I'm half health to engage because you're a worthless cunt is a distinctly Horde trait.
---
Why not place the blame where it actually belongs instead of crying about one of the two factions in a game that's entire PvP is based on those two sides fighting. Blame the overpopulated/unbalanced servers, because I can guarantee the horde on servers with more ally are doing the exact same thing that you think is "distinctly a horde trait".
---
My main hit 50 the day before phase 2, weep for me.
---
I'm on Deviate Delight, it seems like the only pvp server that has more alliance than horde :/
---
World pvp is the best thing ever.
---
If we don't have official numbers, how can Auberdine be the "most populated French server" ?
---
Well given that your argument starts with something which has never been proven, to tell you that you are lying is still correct even if you don't like it.
---
&gt;Also because you were able to login without queue on a server while another one had queue doesn't mean you have proven without a doubt that the first one is less populated
---
It's not conclusive proof, I agree, but it's still way better than "trust me dude" without ANYTHING to even suggest you are right...
---
GET SOME FUCKING KEYBINDS WTF HOW YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME LIKE THAT
---
A trifling Victory, but a Victory nontheless.
---
I am going to SM to pick up the dog whistle, buy a cheap gun and leather from the vendor and once the raid starts I will just equip it all and join the hunters. First raid with new guild. If they don't have a good laugh time to look for another guild :p
---
They might change next week when the realize they didn't get honor from that.
---
&gt;From a business perspective, there is no better way to engage your original core audience than to provide them the product they liked
---
You have to be delusional to think retail is anywhere close to the classic trilogy. Setting some numbers to 60 and slapping a couple of old skills on top doesn´t do shit. I will never install retail again. My plate stays clean of that bloatware of a game.
---
Did you teach growl to your pet? Did you activate growl on your pet? Did you learn higher level growl for yourself so you can upgrade your pet's growl?
---
Also check petopia classic for pet skills, levels and attack speeds.
---
Just start drinking the second combat drops. The only time it doesn’t work is if the tank pulls the next pack immediately - in which case you tell them to slow down.
---
Haven’t had any hiccups in 50 levels healing as a priest. It’s a learning process but it definitely separates good from bad healers.
---
Do you have growl set to auto cast for your pet? Also what spec are you? Beast master makes it much easier, if you went MM or Survival then that it your issue I would assume
---
Yea, so better downvoting my opinion.
---
I've found SM Cath to be a decent gold farm when DM-East runs aren't popping. A run takes roughly 20mins, I make about 30h/hr. Not great but definitely decent enough. No horde to worry about and it's easy
---
First of all you have to learn your pet growl every 10 lvl. 
---
Second get a pet with charge or dash - boars are good at your level, since the first auto attack does extra Damage.
---
Spec BM while leveling.
---
After this you should rarely get Agro.
---
Nice troll
---
Yes, a horde warlock would think so. As an alliance holy paladin, I disagree. Im nearly helpless alone.
---
Fuck that’s smart. Horde really are finding the final solution to the alliance question.
---
Mmmm.. These tears taste delicious 😋
---
I use wekauras and got a string that trcks shots timers and major CD all in one. 
---
Really easy to use and adjust.
---
Drugadditic always super dependable!
---
I honestly have no idea what this comment is getting at.  Care to explain how literally making a 0 content comment makes sense?
---
Not even Blizzard is stupid enough to kill what Classic brought them by merging it into retail. This will never happen.
---
I get this a lot on Shazzrah, I don't get it.
---
They also had to guess how much people would be on. Based on classic setting a company record, they couldn't have predicted most of these stats. They might've used retail as a model for player behavior &amp; had it fail.
---
Or they realize that you can get 1/3 of a full honor solo kill by being ungrouped in Hillsbrand just tagging with high damage spells.
---
Those mages flanking the retreating raid with frostnova+sapper charge, get 40-60 honor per person killed 10-15 times in seconds.
---
Sitting on 100.000 honor. Shoutout to all the noobs in raids making it possible.
---
The game died after Wrath
---
I’m glad as fuck I did this before p2 hit
---
Oh the guy I know is at like level 42 I think? He plays way more than me. I’ve barely played since I hit 51.
---
Oh I've been playing rogue since I started at the end of wotlk, taking a break from the end of cata until mid legion. This is my first time playing vanilla rogue though.
---
I already locked myself in to swords as far as raid gear goes (Viskag &lt;3), unless somehow I'm able to roll on an MC drop dagger as an OS roll. My big issue with dagger builds is no increased stealth or stealth detection. However, I like improved sprint and the idea of not relying *as much* on combo points or set ups for damage. With hemo the quick burst isn't hard to do (cheap &gt; hemo &gt; cb+evis) but it still requires more resources. With how CP's work in vanilla, it's harder to do target swaps for any CC or if a bubble happens.
---
I tried daggers with some meh blue ones for about a week, but the lack of crit right now just felt SO bad. I was thinking of trying to swap around AQ since I heard they kinda pull ahead there where you can run Seal Fate in PvE because of the amount of crit you get. Plus since trinkets will be everywhere in a couple days, it's just another downside to being setup reliant for hemo.
---
Can I buy you a beer, haha. Same issues here, highly regretting playing on a pvp server
---
It does not exist in any regard.
---
This really isn’t WPVP though, it’s large scale Honor Farming. The issue is not the players, they will simply use the systems that are implemented to maximize their Honor/hour.
---
The issue is that the servers have too many people on them.
---
Jesus, my group learned. Sheep first, then kill.
---
u/Dabugar
---
You can also MC the newcomer and have him hit an NPC. The honorless buff fades and you can nuke them for honor.
---
15 years. I've played this game for 15 years and I'm just now discovering this?
---
It's a very sad thing, and also the reason I havent gone back to play it. Almost all of my guild in classic are people that quit wow years and years ago. I have a feeling that a lot of people that play mmos like to be in an immersive WORLD, not a bunch of menus and queues where no o e on your server matters because you just queue up to play with anyone from any server. There is no community in retail.
---
On my classic server I ran into this motherfucker in deadmines that was our tank. He was an asshole and I never wanted to play with him again. Now I see him standing around Ironforge. If he's ever in a group that I join, I know him and his behavior. That's the kind of things an MMO is about. It's a real shame that I have to even try to explain this to you because this kind of thing was taken for granted when it did exist in retail.
---
Retail wow isn't an MMORPG.
---
The Benediction quest is a lot easier, but it is very cool. You just have to kill some skeletons and keep a bunch of NPCs alive, it's like a hard mode version of the first aid quests.
---
You barely spent time in Azeroth during TBC.
---
No, but you also never had to run into people, because you flew everywhere you needed to.
---
I watched this happen. The guards didn't go after him or anything.
---
Anyway, the point is Alliance are dicks too, despite the holier-than-thou attitude they seem to have on reddit.
---
just respecced from 30/21/0 for raids to 25/26/0. still manage to heal pretty much the same, but damn, rogues just get squished.
---
still don't have a slow enough weapon, but the sword from DM North is alright so far
---
But mc is easy you’re all supposed to be alive?
---
Sorry, I meant to say rogue discord
---
We just sheep them.
---
What sucks is I really want to be part of this but I"m not level 60. And because I'm not it's going to take me way longer to get there since it takes me an extra 20 minutes+ just to get into BRD every night.
---
Spy is a legitimate addon.
---
I heard diet Coke has more carcinogens than regular coke
---
Same. I always let the healer know that I’m good on heals, save it for tank. And I let the tank know if I pull Aggro ,not to worry I’ll can handle the mob. It’s never been an issue in my dungeon groups.
---
Hmmm interesting.  Just doesn’t feel like it to me.  My med pop classic server feels way less crowded than my vanilla Windrunner server which had an 11 to 1 Alliance to Horde ratio, and I’m Horde in both cases.
---
it wasn't shitty tho
---
World Pvp on a PvE server and I get this message from a level 1 Undead
---
Yes most pve servers and heartseeker pvp is wayyyy imbalanced. As a horde on heartseeker i don't mind tho, easy honor all day.
---
I'm not sure you understood what I've meant. I understand how it works - just that this is implying that jumping in with a fire blast at the end and earning 10 honor for it is a bad idea, because you're forfeiting future honor gains for that, assuming of course you plan to kill the guy again.
---
Can't they just hearth out?
---
I’ve run BRD 10 times the last day and die one time tops each time. It’s really not that bad.
---
ganksquads are generally the best way to play right now
---
Its not just your faction. Warlocks do particularly well in unstructured or solo contexts, while (for instance) a resto shaman would be far weaker as a world pvp ganker and much better in organized group contexts.
---
It is not worth replacing your entire glove slot for, but it's pretty decent to get if you can. Like with maladath.
---
Go do BRD at 55.  That's a good level for the entire run.  You can run it a few times to get to 56 at least.  Then, just go to WPL and start questing.  I guarantee between that, WPL, and Winterspring, there are more than enough quests to get you from 56-60.
---
Yesterday, I got killed like 10 times on my way to BRD
---
There was Horde ganking in Everlook
---
There was horde ganking people in Menethil Harbor(but they got wiped by alliance using the ship from time to time)
---
And there was horde freely ganking in Morgan's vigil.
---
Did you try to stop dying?
---
If pvp makes you quit then you really didn't like classic pvp servers.
---
This guy's gets it
---
easily mage
---
Yeah, I'm the mentally challenged one not the guy complaining about PVP on a PVP server. 
---
Go play hello island kitty adventure and let the real players play, thanks.
---
Actually pretty awesome if you ask me. Ran MC last night and alli had an MC group coming in also. Was a fun battle. If you get ganked on the way to a dungeon it’s honestly your fault if you can’t get away in at most 2 deaths. I never once got ‘camped’ like people say. People claiming they are ‘camped’ are just stubborn and don’t understand world pvp. If alli have the numbers advantage, you need to take another route or do something else. Stop doing the same thing and expecting a different result ppl.
---
There's any number of things they could do, but at this point they are out of options that won't piss people off. (Rightfully so) 
---
I think I would have enjoyed the the smaller world of Warcraft. As is I occasionally run into people I know, maybe at 60 it gets better, but as someone with real life commitments everyone I play with seems to out level me. 
---
Plus can you imagine how cool a smaller, somewhat balanced pop server with no spy add-on would be? I know it's a pie in the sky dream, but I think that's what I'd aim for if I were in charge of blizzard. Allies you know fighting horde you know. Hiding and either going unnoticed or pulling off an ambush cuz spy is banned. That's the shit. But I guess ill just imagine it in between assraping bouts with the horde, at least until I decide that I'd rather just play apex legends again and say fuck this.
---
It still annoys me that they decided to remove Crusader Strike because they didn't want people spamming it rather than doing something simple like giving it a cooldown.  Seriously, it took an entire expansion for them to come up with that?
---
what us alpha??
---
It's not really about realism, it's just exciting is all.
---
It wasn't this bad in vanilla. Almost certainly as a result of stuffing a ridiculous amount of people onto servers. Back in the day, sure, fighting would break out, and certain areas were common fighting areas, but camping every flight point in the freaking game wasn't normal.
---
I'm on my fifth char, got 4x60. I ding them 60 at 5-6 days played.
---
Okay maybe your not a no lifer then but why do you have to speak to people like such a dick? It doesnt help this game at all. A major draw to classic is community. It has been mostly great up until this phase and now its polarising.
---
Nope, I'm Alliance on Gandling EU and I have never in 14 years of wow had more fun. It's probably 60/40 or 65/35 H/A. That said, I get why people leveling wants to quit and while I personally love phase 2, I understand why they will have to break it soon... just stop
---
As an Alliance on this server, I can't recommend more Horde come to this server, I don't need more of your kind camping my boats and fps.
---
Disagree I've been having a blast as solo mage running around. Occasionally a raid runs me over but mostly it's been good
---
Awesome bro, guess you don't have any issues with social interactions
---
I would love to turn this into a T-shirt. Its flipping awesome!
---
Hence why people rushed to 60 and suggested it
---
I saw the top post as well, you're not funny
---
Q
---
Swifty is old as fuck, dude in almost in his 40's
---
I wonder how efficient it is since you get less honor from killing those lower level than you.
---
Especially since you get diminished honor based on the damage you did to the target. If the place is overcrowded and you kill players lower level, the honor you gain would be minuscule.
---
Feedback got me a couple HKs in hillsbrad yesterday.. i was happy it did stuff.
---
Do Shaman get a similar quest in any upcoming Phases?
---
Honestly that’s your fault imo. If you simply die in the right spots you can get away and out of sight in order to get yourself closer and or get into the dungeon.
---
57 Rerolled to westfall. Having a blast.
---
why not cry more and go back to retail if this isnt for you?
---
Wow i never knew they had so much to offer. Thanks for the info. Ill prolly roll shaman or druid. Im guess druid is easier to level with?
---
But i got ganked the other day as a horde so it's equal!!
---
&gt;I'm rubber your glue 2019.

Not everybody on the internet lives in the United States?

Yeahhhh ands it’s you

Go fury for PH, try to kite things so I don't die, run into another invisible mob and for anyway. 10/10

its diet coke you asshole
---
I like flying along with people with mind vision lol.
---
BB much safer than Menethil on my server
---
I was explaining that if they just kill someone without waiting or doing some trickery. For what it’s worth I’ve never been mc’d like that. Also grats on winning with every advantage imaginable :)
---
You're dealing with WoW players, it's never their own fault. Blizzard is usually to blame.
---
Population cap on layerless seems to be at around 6K players. At least that's what it is on my realm which is the "first overflow" PVP realm (the first other pvp realm they opened up after name reserve on the single one initially set up got swamped). That realm is the second highest pop realm and has Sunday evening queues in excess of 1 hour.
---
The number is based on Census+ scans manually triggered which take about 20 minutes on the smaller faction. Faction difference is about 1000 players more active on Horde during prime time. (So it is about 3500 vs 2500 ish).
---
You want a fast dagger in the offhand for poison procs. Any fast weapon works, but you’re generally not going to find many swords, axes, or maces in the sub-1.5 range that you want.
---
The reason people say “slow mainhand” is not because of the speed; it’s the damage range. One of the best mainhands you’ll find in the late 30’s is Black Malice, which is 1.5. It’s really faster than you typically want in a mainhand, but it tops out at 58, which is going to be better than anything else until Satyr’s Lash at 45. Then at 50 or so is Lifeforce Dirk from Sunken Temple, another 1.5 you’ll use in your mainhand until you get Heartseeker, Core Hound Tooth, Perdition’s, or Felstriker.
---
&gt; You're able to raid as a shadow priest because private servers allowed people to gain a more complete understanding of what the classes are capable of.
---
In my opinion there is also a significant difference in regards to the hybrid classes usability as DPS: Namely that the fights in the current content (MC/Ony) are fantastically short fights. The major downside of the hybrid DPS classes has (in my experience) typically been seen as having issues with sustaining DPS (due to running OOM) and lack of scaling (but I think the coefficients that the assessments have been based on might've been faulty). 
---
Either way, even if those 2 points are an issue, it's not an issue that's apparent in the current content due to the shorter fights and that scaling hasn't progressed very far as of yet. I'm honestly really curious to see how their perform on some of the longer fights in the following phases (and while the fights won't take much longer for the top-end guilds, it will actually start to have more of an impact on the non-top-end guilds out there).
---
Claimer being required to provide proof isn't laziness mate.

you stop paying... nothing happens.  
---
You start paying and the services start to work again.....

Why do you even need to ask this ? Thats how the world works.  
---
If you stop paying for the Gym, you can't use their facilities anymore...... untill you pay again.

I dont get, some explain wth is going in this video?
---
Grats.
---
TheLegend is here
---
I just don’t like using reddit on the computer lol and it was faster this way
---
What fraction are you playing ?:)
---
All of their dumbass examples involve single digit groups, in a single area, at a specific time. It's hilarious how oblivious they are.
---
The part you are missing is that there is a threshold for player populations.  Once you reach a certain point, the safeguards that Blizzard put into place to ensure quest hubs are at least somewhat contestable with an outnumbered faction become broken.  Camping Morgan's Vigil 24/7 should not be possible and was not possible in Vanilla.  You'd need a huge chunk of the player base to do it and if you camped there, there wouldn't be camps elsewhere.
---
I'm having an ok time doing the final leveling. I'm Horde on a pretty even server, and I went 49-51 this weekend, without too much trouble. Sure I got ganked a bunch and sometimes certain zones just became unplayable, but I was able to move around from one zone to another to find places to safely level. 
---
Even when a huge Alliance group shows up, they generally just dick around in the quest hub area, so if you can just leave and do actual quests, it's ok. 
---
For what it's worth, I think that this is a temporary problem, even without BGs coming early. Right now, there is a huge novelty factor to making giant kill squads and murderizing a whole zone. But that's gonna fade in a week or so, and I think things will be back to mostly normal.
---
Yeah,  but that goes for the negative also.
---
You do realize people have had three months to level yeah? At this point if you're not sixty you are barely even playing or maybe you enjoy leveling alts to 30? But still if that's the case you knew what you were getting into. Like I said above the echo chamber of the majority of players aren't sixty is a lie.
---
The internet is universial baring China.
---
Can someone borrow this man a brain
---
I've updated this addon myself and been using it since launch. I've thought of making it public many times as well, but seeing how people react to the Spy addon I decided to just keep it to myself. I really dont want Blizzard to break this addon.
---
I'm sorry you dont understand sarcasm/satire.
---
Calm down Manson
---
Gamers are stupid children who have no idea what they want, but they still want it right now.
---
Still a better bet to do what you want and see if they like it than to do what they say they want when they actually don't want that at all but are too stupid to realise it, that's how retail got to this state.

So I finally got into RFK again and got Corpsemaker!  I've been busy so I haven't had time to do much in-game, but it was totally worth the effort. The thing hits like a truck! 
---
So now I'm a happy level 33 Ret Pally in a mix of blues from VC/BFD/RFK plus some greens.  Also, I'm at the point in the shimmering flats where they've shipped me out to STV and the Badlands, so I've hit that "go ding a couple of times and then you can continue these chains!" chokepoint there.
---
So where did you prefer to level your Paladin in your 30's? STV, Arathi, and even Desolace all seem like good options. I'm just having trouble settling on one lol 
---
Eventually I will go to SM, but I need a small break from dungeons.
---
 Ew r/cringetopia
---
I read the post in an Alex Jone's voice. Fits prettly well lul.
---
The game has been out for 15 years 
---
How the hell can u pick wrong server?
---
Delicious tears are such a joy to farm
---
Notice how it's only alliance babbies posting crying about how they spend all day in the black and white screen?
---
Honor is shared between the entire raid group. But it is also shared with anyone who contributes to the kill outside the raid group.
---
Everyone is currently rank 0 so a level 60 killing a level 60 would be worth 198 honor total, for the first kill.
---
So assume you are in a 40man raid group and no one outside the group tags the enemy:
---
198 / 40 = ~5 honor per player
---
This will reduces by 25% each consecutive kill on the same target though, regardless of what the estimated says in your chat log.
---
Now assume there’s two 40man raid groups fighting together. If both raid groups contribute 50% of the damage to the enemy, honor will be split twice.
---
Raid group share: 198 / 2 = 99 honor per raid
---
Player share: 99 / 40 = ~2.5 honor per player
---
Then account for diminishing returns, making honor gain almost non existent.
---
Finally let’s assume a group of 5, because realistically, most people will farm honor in groups of 5-10 if they are serious about ranking. Less than that is only really viable for rogues/druids on higher population servers. 
---
198 / 5 = ~40 honor per player
---
Anyone participating in the TM vs SS massive pvp fights are likely getting 0-3 honor per kill, on average. Their 40 hks are worth about the same as a 5 man group who got 1 hk. On an hourly basis, the majority of those kills will DR to almost nothing.
---
Tl;dr massive raid groups are terrible for farming honor
---
Unfortunately post history indicates this is real.
---
So?  
---
Learn to play, screw those addons.
---
How do you know this. Do you play both alliance and horde on each server? I've heard a ton of stories of horde getting ganked. It really only takes a few high levels on either side to ruin a zone. Almost everyone i've spoken to on horde has been ganked or griefed.
---
If you don't always expect a Rogue there, Spy won't help you be better in PvP...
---
4? That's rookie numbers. It's taking me 4 deaths just to get maybe 100 yards off the TP flightpoint. Takes at least 10 deaths to get into DM.
---
you can also only use riposte after you have parried an attack, very situational ability
---
I'm on a extremely high pop pvp server and while I hate phase 2, it is not because I'm getting ganked.
---
It's just really really REALLY fucking boring to sit at flightpaths and sap people for 30 seconds before killing them, and overall having the choice between dying to a 10man group, or finding some random noob who isn't  a challenge.
---
I have had very few good pvp moments in these last couple days, almost fewer than I had per day before phase 2 came out.
---
No, I don't think it is lmao
---
Or when they stop if you get an inch ahead of them.
---
I play to have fun. I could have 'fun' by getting into drugs; ie Drinking. Or partying, or going on vacations. Then spend way more than $15/mo on my habit. To me, $15/mo for 'quality fun' that leaves me with money left over to invest so I can retire early and be free, is optimal.
---
Also, Life is sub-optimal. Everything you achieved, all that you were will end and be forgotten. (( Yes, I make a very good Death Knight. :P ))
---
Alliance players experience what you experienced 95% of their playtime. Any horde on herod complaining is a fucking tool.
---
I've been trying to do my own BRD farm runs as well... I'm sorta new to it, but I feel like my pickpocket gets resisted so often, which then leads to a lot of unnecessary downtime. Gonna have to try it while spec'd into sub.
---
The mans left out Sonydigital FEELSBADMAN
---
Hey, random question. I find half the time I'm opening the Dark Keeper portrait I pull the mobs in that room and half the time I don't and end up having to kill the closest one/vanish. Any advice on how to avoid having to fight that room?
---
Darkshore quest IIRC. Or Ashenvale one.
---
What are these 1v1s you're talking about? Every time I've tried to engage one 1 person, about 4-5 more show up before we can even finish fighting.
---
Good to know, corrected my post
---
It's an okay 1v1 spec for sure, but suffers from "not mage" syndrome.  You're just better off bringing a mage to group pvp.  FWIW I disagree with a lot of what reddit says AND I'm currently playing an 8/11/32 druid.  Reddit has a weird hardon for moonkin that is totally undeserved. I also never said balance was completely unviable.
---
Let me give it a shot and see! Thank you!!
---
All good advice here, have to play to your strengths. Though I loved having boomkin form for my pvp druid in Vanilla.
---
Since I noticed you didnt mention it, make sure you do your attunements before going through the effort of finding  a raid group and so forth.
---
For MC it's a simple quest where you have to go to the bottom of BRD and get the core fragment right by the MC portal. 
---
For onyxia, it's a kind of annoying chain of quests that takes a bit of dedicated focus to get through. Not insanely difficult, but definitely some world travel and dungeon runs.
---
They're worth honor by the time they rez.
---
Typo. That was supposed to say isn’t. You should have been able to figure that out though.
---
It’s obvious. Both sides are literally the same made up of the same groups of people. Yes of course one side is going to seem worse when their side is hugely dominant on any server. That’s not exclusive to horde or alliance.
---
Its just my personal experience. The wowhead gives us a rough estimate (i know its characters created not accounts) of having a 60/40 balance. I know that literally every single instance entrance was camped by horde in p1. So factoring in the daily 4-6k ques, the fact that literally anywhere you went you got outnumbered, in my opinion its safe to assume that more alliance players would reroll than horde. 
---
But even if we keep the 60/40 balance, thats still quite a lot more horde than ally. If we talking about only that, then the gap between the 2 factions is essentially as large as a fully populated server - both ally AND horde - was 15 years ago. 
---
The whole point of my post is/was, that due to the increased capacity of servers the faction imbalance got out of control.
---
It wouldn't, having multiple accounts is something they don't directly support.
---
sony who?
---
Vanilla was not like this yes, but the mentality of I paid you 15 bucks a month so I can do these things is what made wow into what it is today.
---
I paid you 15 dollars, I should be able to quest in peace on a pvp server.
---
I paid you 15 dollars, I should be able to see 5 mans without spamming trade for a tank.
---
I paid you 15 dollars, I should be able to see raid content without being good and have the time.
---
I paid you 15 dollars, I should be able to get mythic level gear without raiding.
---
This is just the same mentality, applied to a different problem.
---
its one of the more annoyig matchups but you are easier to 1v1 then a mage or a SL warlock
---
But they also screwed up the balance first time around. So many alliance left Skeram and went to heartseeker because we were so outnumbered. A few horde left the 2nd time around but its 80-20 at best now. If you leave a capital city to try and farm herbs, god forbid farm elementals, you are ganked until you log out or hearth by 50+ horde in each zone.
---
&gt;distinctly Horde trait
---
Lmao imagine unironically thinking this
---
Right now you quest in groups to fend off single players or you don't quest at all.  The roving death squads... you just try to avoid them.  Even breadcrumb quests are next to impossible to solo.
---
Hello brother - let us fill our vials full of alliance scum tears
---
A good one at that.
---
They're few and far between so typically you'll just memorize them once you learn which mobs they are.
---
The ghouls Stratholme are another I've noticed.
---
no i signed up on a pvp server because i wanted a normally populated server not mega server like nost, so lame when the game is side content and all you get to do is fight 1vsX hordes at every choke in the game
---
Battlegrounds do need to come early. They can keep some of the gear gated still. It’s just an unfun environment watching people just sit in Hillsbrad pushing back and forth trading kills basically. Battlegrounds provide a more interactive PvP experience that’s will still occupy people’s time while allowing people to level/smaller pvp/farm outside battlegrounds
---
That thousand needles harpy cave is an infinitely spawning, silk cloth dropping, iron ore having, chest spawning lovely little grind zone if you want to just turn off your brain and walk out an hour later.
---
Circle of jerks!
---
It's fucking shitty shit, boring as fuck for people trying to rank.
---
SM/Ruin for both PvE and PvP if you're lazy and don't want to pay for respecs.
---
Yeah to get around this as a mage i put detect magic and wait it out with poly. But cba tbh did that first couple days before shit was boring. PvP only reason I'm playing this game but atm all I can find myself doing is leveling alts cus I'm not a fan of raid pvp constantly and pref being able to roll solo or fight in small groups.
---
its so you have time to catch up if you dont have a mount, but not walking speed to where it will take forever
---
Yeah I clearly didn't engage my brain case before reading this comment chain. My bad
---
*Psst. Get out while you still can. You don't want to know what they did to the last guy who started talking sense that didn't coincide with the group-think #NoChanges mentality.*
---
500g at 6.83g per leather in 3 hours, that's 24 leather/hour or basically a leather every 2-3 minutes. That's some damn efficient farming or strange math. Do you always get one leather per skin or is it 1-3?
---
I don't think you really understand what it's like to play on these horde dominated PvP servers.
---
Getting to BRD is a guaranteed 5-6 death adventure, and I'm a paladin that can bubble myself. Lord help you if you are a class without some sort of dash or blink. It's to the point where you spend the normal 30 minutes finding a group, then another 30 minuted running to BRD.
---
The best way is just to park your character at BRD, but in the event that you need to bank or repair you have to do it all over again. Thank god for the vendor in the bar.
---
Questing is next to impossible, in less populated areas like plaguelands you may get 5-10 minutes of uninterrupted questing, but turning in any quest means you'll be dying, hopefully the horde hasn't killed the questgiver. More contested places like Winterspring or Searing Gorge are literally just unplayable. 
---
Flying anywhere is a gamble, as you may land to a raid of horde that has killed the flightmaster and all the NPC's. Don't worry, they're farming the GY too so good luck finding a way out of there. Unless you can bubble hearth you are looking at ghost running to another GY.
---
Hell, even boats aren't safe. Now, I expect there to be PvP on neutral boats, but the boats from menethil are camped as well. Our level 30's can't even quest.
---
Some people are idiots, you can heal at least the first part of BRD sub 50 with a decent squad.
---
I havent noticed this on the Horde side, no.
---
This so much. This is something that can only happen now. Once BGs release, this is gone forever. Enjoy the chaos while it lasts. Stop trying to pressure Blizzard into changing their schedule because you dont like dieing from pvp on a pvp server. This is temporary, not permenant.
---
I did full BRD with 3 53 dps last night (60 tank and 60 healer) and it went really good. Only wipe was in the torch room and that's understandable. Those guys got a shit load of XP too.
---
It's not the true Vanilla experience if you can't get banished to PvExile and be unable to find a good raiding guild because they're all on PvP servers and transfers only go one way.
---
If your Shadow Priest is doing less than 50% of the damage of the top classes, the Shadow Priests in those raids must *really* suck. Not that I'm claiming Shadow Priests are able to top the DPS-charts, but it's not as drastic as what you are portraying. The difference gets more pronounced once the later raids come, as the longer fights and poorer scaling will start having more of an impact on their performance.
---
Everything stays the same except UI settings but thats easily fixed by renaming a wtf folder
---
As it should be.  There's no point going for r14 if you aren't in an organized group and literally have no life.
---
I don't think it's a bad thing.  This isn't retail where every achievement is meaningless because they're so easy to get.
---
Sweet techno yo
---
It baffles me how people didn't see this coming.
---
Okay, let's just add in LFR and flying mounts then, since we're already "completely non-vanilla"
---
yes
---
the OG time table for BGs were 8 weeks seeing how we are running the "easier" honor system and the pvp mafia guilds know what they are doing and you can keep useing the pvp gear once your rank gose down give it 5-6 weeks and the pvp lords should be futher ahead in gear than they ever were in vanilla.
---
Who talks about organisation? wPvP are brain dead capital raids or any mass PvP where several raids crash into one another. This is fun, exiting but pointless with a lot of DKs or chances of being wiped out by enemy reinforcements. No people are smarter. They form gangs and roam spots where people are trying to finish their last 5 lvls for 100-0 fights and easy honor grind. Some say that HK 25% decay is broken. GL with that and people leaving disbalanced PvP servers.
---
Being a priest I jump near the gate on the north side and slowfall down in front of the blood elf who ports me in
---
Never used to require addons. I remember turning it off in the options way back in vanilla because it used to tank my already low FPS.
---
I'd say a good raid group of people with consumes could finish MC + Ony in 3 hours comfortably, might be a stretch if you wipe on bosses but it doesn't really require speedrunning
---
Something's not quite right...
---
WHO GOES THERE?
---
Past 250 it will take ~10 catches per level.
---
You can't really solo it since you have to kill hydrospawn, but if you have the DMN key you can at least get the quest yourself without fighting anything (or have someone who does have the key run in and unlock the library with you).
---
Where as I tend to agree with you on this one, I have to support the just ignore their calls for the groups. Yes it's annoying, and maybe it's a bit self-entitled, but make the group, make the rules. 
---
Only way I'd be pissed is if I signed up for the group, waited around for it to finish forming, then as we are entering the dungeon to be told all of that was reserved. At that point you should have been upfront about it. Otherwise, I'd ignore it.
---
That's the thing some folks don't get.  You can't have "No changes" because it's 2019 - not 2004.  The playerbase has changed fundamentally, which means the game is changed.  Sometimes you have to make changes in order to preserve the spirit of Classic.
---
False, there were zero horde camping on the boat in question.
---
Dude, buying gold from a 3rd party gets you banned in classic, in retail you can just buy gold from blizz's store.
---
Spy saved me from getting gabked by 60s whilst leveling, if you think I'm going to disable it so you can kill me easier think again
---
not evolved but more like corrupted by well of eternity aka ysharj blood
---
&gt; the entrance is always ~~contested.~~ filled with 50+ level 60 Horde aoe'ing non stop.
---
He’s seen some shit, he’s seen it all
---
I did this all the time in Vanilla without an addon. Just because you now have game knowledge you didn't have 15 years ago doesn't mean you're "cheating".
---
they're the exact same spells.
---
What are the best dueling (1v1) classes?
---
Used to be on liberia, but i never made it past 40
---
Yep, totally agree.
---
I have loads of sympathy for people who tried out Classic for the first and were told 'PVP servers are the real servers' etc etc.  
---
A casual player levelling at a normal pace probably won't be 60 by now. And now they'll be getting dumpstered all over Azeroth.
---
Hopefully it will die down a bit when people get bored of the Honor grind or BGs come out.
---
hmm,
---
that does make me think.
---
thank you for bringing that to my attention.
---
do you think the problem itself is different then?
---
to recap:
---
reddits problems seem very catered towards solo players and people that pug alot of content.
---
finding a guild or people to play with seems to solve these problems.
---
that requires time commitment tough.
---
at first i thought: " if you cant commit enough time to solve the issue, you probably shouldnt have the game catered towards you" but that is awfully elitist i guess.
---
or is it? what do you think?
---
should the game be changed to better fit a more casual approach to gaming or should timeinvestment be rewarded in a linear/ exponential fashion?
---
As a new player who’s just dinged 60, how do I learn how to raid?
---
I’ve collected 60-70% of my pre-bis, am mc attuned, and have 500-ish gold to spare. I’m in a very small, very casual social guild, and was the first to 60 and so I was planning to pug. The problem is that I have literally 0 experience raiding as I’ve never played an mmorpg in my life before this iteration of wow classic, and pugging with zero experience seems like a terrible idea.
---
The obvious thing to do is to join a new guild, but a) I don’t want to abandon the friends I’ve made, b) I don’t know if I can commit to a raiding schedule because of rl commitments, c) I don’t know if any guild would want me since I have zero experience. What should I do?
---
Kirtonos/horde disc/holy priest btw
---
Shut up nerd
---
enjoy spending hours getting in and out of your dungeons :D
---
I love it. 
---
So RP.
---
Ahh yes. I have some reading to do. I skipped Ulda on this character so that's why it's so fuzzy for me.
---
You could take 30 mins and learn to customize the built in combat log as well to get two thirds of the way that Spy goes. You won't have a fancy UI but you can actually make it more verbose and useful than Spy currently is.
---
I’m enjoying the Hillsbrad battles which weren’t happening as much before the patch
---
[Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)
---
Can I offer you an egg in these trying times?
---
Or maybe it's both of us.   Or maybe it's everyone! 
---
PvP and Normal have a difference.  You can look at it as one is normal and the other is the exception, or vice versa.  Things could just as easily have been called Normal, PvE, RP, and RP-PvE.  They could also have been PvE, PvP, RP-PvE and RP-PvP.  There is no one obvious right way for the naming and frankly any one of the 4 could have been called "Normal".  
---
I think it was probably that Blizzard wanted to steer new players to normal and make sure PvP players knew they were opting in to PvP experience so when it was a disaster they could just shrug and say "you chose this disaster".
---
lol most of the time the 2006 comments are correct.
---
Agreed. I’m all for people enjoying their PVP but most of us didn’t realize this is what it was until now. And therefore most of us think it sucks. I’m hugely supportive of PVP to PVE transfers at this point.
---
Why play other games when you can play classic imo I haven’t even attempted another game because I know I won’t enjoy it as much at the moment.
---
I am a rogue. My only "organic" pvp is attacking people who are running alone and killing them in a rather consistent and uneventful fashion.
---
Removing DHKs is the only thing I hard disagree with. If there is no punishment for killing low level players then more people will do it. Those players don't stand a chance so DHKs are necessary. It doesn't stop killing lowbies entirely but it reduces it a lot.
---
That’s what I’ve been doing but it gives incentive for your alt then when you finally hit 60 you’ll prob have a lvl 30 alt
---
/holup
---
As a level 39 hunter questing through STV right now, I really like the Phase 2 changes - sure it can be annoying when the Nessingwary Camp becomes infested with a few 60s, but normally its just groups of mid 30s duking it out for control.
---
When the 60s do arrive, having intimidation from your pet actually connecting and stunning the 60 to have a group of lowbies take them out feels rewarding as well. 
---
Probably the minority that isn't in a rush though
---
Same. The ally to horde ratio in vanilla was 2 to 1, so, its not much of a brag.
---
Spy does **NOT** give coordinates of the detected enemy player. It gives YOUR coordinates at the time Spy detected the player.
---
Yep, sure does buddy.  You are given the choice of how much of a scumbag you are going to be.  They’ve given you a no limits scenario and you choose to go as scummy as possible.  Congratulations, I hope all the alliance on your server quits and you have nothing to do but bask in your own asshattery.
---
You escaped the whooosh
---
I’m under the impression most warlocks understand this and have to wAit for the pull to start draining life. 
---
Ask them to use it more if they aren’t. I’ve had to tell healers that I’m gonna drain life (while leveling) to get back health from life tap. Most of them say they don’t care especially at 60 but I’m surprised to see people complaining this much about them.
---
Ganking/ farming hks doesn't make you a scumbag.
---
[Uh Oh!](https://i.imgur.com/aaozebz.png)
---
Because that's more convenient than using other means to reach the same goal which WoW offers nevertheless? The key point it's not too convenient to be considered gamebreaking by Blizzard.
---
Based on "how trivialized does addon X make something" raid addons like DBM/Bigwigs or auction addons like TSM are way ahead of something like Spy.
---
Just google “Classicwowbis” and it will take you to an easy to navigate website. Not everything listed is always the best or easiest option (includes some random world drop epic BoEs, etc.). It is a good guideline though. Also the ones from wowhead list multiple options for preraid-BiS/BiS items.
---
Some very desperate virgins even camped the pirate ships for hours lol.
---
Out of curiosity, what guild are you in?
---
Nah, as a horde player I want BGs. I don’t like flying all the way around the world and competing with other horde just for some pvp action. I think it really depends on what you enjoy. I play a spec that isn’t too reliant on the honor gear (ele shaman). I play the game for for fun and engaging pvp. Do you think I’m having fun struggling to find any pvp in the open world? It’s not fun. I’d much prefer to just queue for a battleground. I spent the first day of phase 2 feeling it out. I’ve realized it’s absolute trash, so I’ve been leveling an alt
---
What is this addon that shows so many quests on the right in the right color?
---
I think the issue here is that you chose to be on the alliance. This issue has only started for alliance characters since phase 2.
---
The 5 day window is set for everyone.  In-game check /raidinfo if you've already killed.  If not, check wowhead frontpage for reset times.
---
Playing the game on Hard Mode satisfying for some. The Horde "baby's first mmo" option is there for the less savvy individual though.
---
The lowbies trying to quest in Hillsbrad right now..
---
Can anyone pull up some old posts back in '04/'05 of people complaining about world pvp?  I'm personally a fan of seeing history repeat itself.
---
There's no such information.  
---
All existing sites use player-submitted data, and are not reliable.
---
You can trinket it.
---
Huh? I was direct in my opinion but I wasn't bashing you. I didn't call you any names or anything (but you have, so that's cool).  
---
I just think you're wrong and I said so.
---
Don't think they're blaming Blizzard. People had a fantasy of large world PvP, and all its turned out to be is 60s ganking 50s. The casual community that hasn't made it to 60 yet will simply stop playing if they're just going to get ganked endlessly. Already had 2 friends over the weekend decide the game isn't enjoyable right now and stopped playing.
---
Because in universe they're supposed to be cities riddled with crime and other illegal activities
---
aaaa makes sense!
---
let me guess, UD mage on a horde heavy server?
---
Playing alliance now too.  Woo wee.
---
I took some bad advice from this subreddit that claimed PvP was the only true way to experience classic wow and now I seriously regret it.
---
Signed, a very envious Alliance toon.
---
World PVP has never been fair.
---
It's always been ganking, camping, drive-by-DoTing, and the occasional server-stuttering faction clashes in Southshore. 
---
You'd know it was time to move on from Tarren Mill when it took you 1+ min to open the mailbox. 
---
Pretty normal stuff is happening and it's weird that so many people seem surprised by it.
---
The fact that this is news to me should demonstrate just how little I know about fighting players.
---
Also, another happy cake day!
---
You must be really fun at parties
---
Yeah as a healer, tanks who aren’t paying any attention can sure lead to a disaster, it’s not hard to look at 1 mana bar. That said, I would persevere seems like a group/s problem to me rather than a level one.
---
I have no idea how they collect their data, and have none to compare.
---
But HOW can a server be supposedly the least populated, yet be the one where queues are the highest ? Last night I was 2100 on sulfuron queue yet I was 80 on Auberdine. 
---
I'd love to be wrong, but how is that if Auberdine is higher ? Because it's not a one time thing, queues have always been higher on Sulfuron.
---
I saw a lot of different "tracking population" reports, and they are always veeeery different between two apps. Some even claimed that Sulfuron had more people than Faerlina.
---
For example, your data claims that Sulfuron is the lowest pop French serv, but Blizard is officially listing Amnennar and Finkle to be "medium realms" iirc (can't launch game rn, but I'm pretty sure at least one of them is medium).
---
How come ?
---
Meh. Ten seconds in just looks like a clickbait hit piece on a popular streamer for YouTube ad dollars. 
---
Hard pass.
---
There is no rp rule set..... is there?? I thought it was PVE ruleset and players were just encouraged to RP
---
A lot of folks have figured out how to minimize their impact.  Although I don't see why Blizz couldn't add some Booty Bay water guards for example- goblins riding manatees shooting giant lasers at you if you evoke their ire. 
---
For real though, I feel like PVP can still be *POSSIBLE* in goblin cities but should be extremely difficult.  At least the GY is close.
---
No they have not in classic. You are either very misinformed or are talking about a long time ago. The times change. THERE WAS LITERALLY A BLUE POST SAYING THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING.
---
Either remove all add ons or do nothing
---
As frost? you should have 6%hit and additional snare to make it a non-issue. Just blink whenever he intercepts and you're golden.
---
not sure about before but BWL attunement in 1.12 doesn’t require anything with world bosses..
---
I said it before and I'll say it again.
---
Fuckin crybaby bitch I'm gonna install this twice.
---
I spent all weekend corpse camping 30s until they logged out, I’m sure they enjoyed the vanilla PvP experience.
---
Didn’t even feel like a waste of time since I was just watching football until I hear the spy beep.
---
&gt;  I find it to be rather accurate.
---
It's not accurate at all for two servers that I checked.  
---
You could safely assume that for any server with less than 4k reports, data is heavily screwed.
---
You can literally do this in your combat log. How have so many people just literally never opened the combat log tab before?
---
I’m feeling that more. After my 20th run of UBRS in a row trying to get 1 skinning knife, and TD getting boring.
---
Problem is nobody fucking knew Blizzard would drop Phase 2 way sooner. I could have hit 60 if they kept to the original schedule.
---
Lmao
---
it would fuck raid logging which is half the reason people currently raid right now.
---
i don't want to be a dick about it but do you have any quotes or blueposts to back that up?
---
because i would be **very** pissed if i wouldn't be able to play my twinks anymore because of some arbitrary, badly thought out bandaid fix to a barely existing problem.
---
I have ADHD as well. It's hard I know, mostly because the hyperactivity makes us come off as obnoxious.
---
You didn’t seem to grasp my comment.
---
The space is the screen resolution, and anything rendered on it is 2D.
---
The game is rendered in 2D.
---
I.e. any overlay can be drawn on top and look just as 3D.
---
I never said AVR was ok in my book, and the way it was nuked was by removing information it was using from the API.
---
But I can write an addon that draws boxes with peculiar shapes that ends up looking “3D” for you on your 2D rendering.
---
Congrats she looks good!
---
Wow - boomer detected.
---
I bet you feel bad when evolve your pokemon too.
---
I see Warlock and SPriest get mentioned a lot for this.
---
I'm not parroting anyone, I haven't seen this mentioned once.
---
&gt; Only time I can play is 11pm till like 2 
---
I might try to pop on that late, but even then it's carnage. Prime time is unplayable. 10 minutes sounds like a dream. I also don't like to do dungeons with random groups of people, so I'm being shoehorned into the worst way to play.
---
Some of my guild mates offered to run BRD. After 20/30 minutes of trying to even make it to the mountain (let alone to the entrance or inside) we got a small raid from the guild just to try protect us and instead started a war. People got pissed and left. You land at a flight path and get corpse camped. As far as I'm aware, both the planned Saturday and Sunday raids didn't really go to plan due to massive delays getting started.
---
I work till 6.00/6.30, eat food till 7.30/8.00 and need to look at going to bed by 12pm. In those 4 hours, assuming I do nothing else but play WoW, the only thing I can do in this MMO is corpse run and grind repetitive dungeons for 7+ levels. Can't even do or get the pre-quests without risking getting stuck.
---
I don't personally think so, but not because there aren't queues. Almost all of the more populated servers have primetime queues of 20-30 minutes still.
---
I just think the imbalance of factions on most servers is so large even pushing more alliance in through priority queuing would do little to move the needle.
---
It's actually extremely stupid and anyone participating and enjoying killing level 57s in the middle of attacking a mob are literally mentally challenged and should be given mandatory counseling.
---
I feel like its the opposite. The goblin guard spam a net, and spawn 2 more every seconds.
---
How is it dishonest? [Paranoia was literally the Spy of Vanilla](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/paranoia/)

Yeah, I feel like most people solely play to win nowadays. The RPG aspect is not appealing to the modern playerbase it seems. Everyone is going around in the same pre-bis gear and get upset by dungeon wipes way too easily. They're used to winning all the time and having zero downtime. It makes the game so much less fun for me when I encounter these types of people, and I have a guildie who's like that to an extreme extent when running regular dungeons. It's so mentally draining seeing passive aggressive messages all the time.
---
I feel like the social aspect of the game has been lost.
---
Also depends on your class. I leveled my hunter by killing and kiting every npc or mob that gave xp on my way to quest locations and cities with a pet macro 
---
However I would say questing gives you better xp. You will run into a lot of farm type quests in which you’ll have to kill many mobs. It’s sorta intertwined
---
&gt;Blizzard told people not to roll on the full servers, they did anyway. 
---
I can only assume this is an American argument because every EU server is packed.
---
Thanks everyone this was all helpful
---
We need BGs. Levelling is impossible for casuals right now. I have two 60's, I couldn't imagine trying to go 40-60 at the moment.
---
Damn best geared priest is technologically inept enough to not take a screenshot, ima re roll rq.
---
You think BGs are going to save you from being camped? What do you think people will be doing while they wait 45 minutes in the wsg queue?
---
Look at where your pre raids are from and just go with whatever you feel like.
---
Skip hands of power, crimson fel hat, drakestone,  flameweav cuffs of frozen wrath, and arcavists cape of frozen wrath. They're slight upgrades that aren't worth specifically farming. They're great to pick up while working on other things but most of these can be replaced with greens.
---
Realistically that leaves:
---
Omni boots
---
Sky legs
---
Witchblade/spirit or rod of ogre
---
Reed
---
Eye 
---
Ban sash
---
Star
---
Shoulders
---
Robes of arch/freezing litch.
---
On a horde dominated pvp server, as alliance, I agree with this. Yes there is a small chance it will lose some hype to camp every 50+ flight path, but i doubt it. It is impossible to farm herbs, or just run to a dungeon without passing a few horde raids, and after you finally get past one after they camp you and some 'pro' druid moonfire spams you the second you spawn, you run into another raid.
---
I played on a pvp server in classic, and it was not at all like this, even when honor and world bosses were released. If you wanted world pvp you basically went to southshore/tarren mill, thorium point, or blackrock mountain. If the world bosses were up, pvp was there as well. 
---
I started leveling a lock alt tonfarm DM east, and I may have to instance farm, which is boring.
---
Shadowlands will indicate to blizzard if they should pursue BC and WotLK Classic if players overwhelming pick those expansions to level through.
---
&gt;  freaking click on a name 
---
Can you even read? I've played wow for 15 years and *always* have a separate window with Enemy Player actions highlighted in red. I'm talking about the quick-click shit that gets out of hand. 
---
Learn to follow a conversation.
---
If it was exclusive to some top guilds, sure it couldn't have been a problem back then.
---
Why would it fade?  This is currently the only way to farm honor...
---
I know this "Westfall trap" very well :)  
---
You need to go into another zone (like Loch Modan or Darkshore), or grind 1-2 levels in Westfall by just killing mobs.  
---
There's also 2-3 quests in Redridge that is doable by level 15.
---
Since many of my friends started playing less (at least not online as much as at the start) I started logging into retail a little bit here and there and it's just disheartening how every non-instanced content is trivial to the point where it is annoying having to do it.
---
And all the portals ... why is there even an outside world anymore in that game? Just make it a L4D-like lobby where you queue for content.
---
I know it sounds hella dickish but I can't wrap my head around what kind of person enjoys e.g. world quests or leveling in retail. It's such a chore. It's like doing dished. You kinda have to do it but it's 0 fun, 0 engagement.
---
Mythics raids and dungeons are generally pretty cool (although I don't enjoy the trash fests that BfA dungeons are too much, Legion, WoD and Panda (CMs) were a lot of fun, though. But world content? Why? Why is everything non instanced to terrible gameplay wise? Who wanted that? Who enjoys that? And what kind of player does that raise?
---
People can bash classic all they want but at least you die if you refuse topress any buttons that aren't core to your standard rotation. Classic actually teaches you some shit and if you refuse to do it you're gonna have a bad time - at the latest when people refuse to play with you because you refused to learn anything about how to play the game.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I will never forget when 15 years ago I learned how to interrupt. At the Kurzen camp in north Strangle Thorn I just couldn't kill the healers when they got their heal off, since my burst was too low to damage through it and my mana ... well maybe if I had full mana but that's not a desireable way to do a fight. So I noticed that just counterspelling the heal would enable me to be MUCH more efficient and safe. BÄM learned to play my class.
---
Retail? Just fall asleep on your keyboard and there's a 90% chance that the keys you hit will kill the target before it gets to you. I just don't get it. Who the fuck designs this pile of shit and at the end of the day goes "Yup, that's engaging and fun!"
---
The "PVP fiasco" as you are alluding to, is a bunch of people chose PVP servers without knowing what that was going to entail.
---
Looks great for 40
---
"my shitty day is worse than your shitty day" just let's us all know how much of a piece of shit you really are.
---
Nobodies bad experiences are equal. Trying to minimize others bad experiences so you feel better about your own shows us all how much you need validation for the sad feelings you have.
---
Sorry mate, we all have bad experiences and trying to compare them is stupid.
---
Whats with these constant posts from Alliance just rolling over and getting their cheeks clapped enthusiastically? You guys really fucking suck.
---
There's world pvp in retail again since warmode
---
Yeah but haven't you heard? All retail classes are dumbed down and borong because nuBlizzard bad.
---
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go spam frostbolt for three hours straight. It's raid night.
---
Most of the are playing with 15 min delay so that's irrelevant.
---
A twink vs a nontwink is basicly 2v1 tho
---
Frost nova then the bell is useless
---
Less competition for your gear when you hit 60.
---
Yeah dude is an actual beast
---
Manabane - Alliance Westfall-US
---
Anyone wants some pvp 1v1s hit me up! Southshore vs Tarren mill is boring.
---
The amount of players is different but doesn't change the fact that I got ganked constantly . Fp were death traps. 3+ corpse runs to get into brd. Honestly solo play just isn't as viable anymore.
---
Anyone use FarmLog? Looks like a pretty good addon for tracking your gold gains while farming, was just curious if the interface was mainly hide-able? My screen is already cluttered enough but I definitely want something that tracks and logs my kills while grinding.
---
If you can't even coordinate a meeting point before the raid or a countdown for the flight to thorium point then you have nobody to blame but yourself.
---
Wowhead posted those numbers from people using census, although I'm sure it's out of date by now.
---
Exactly, I was saying anyone who expected WPVP to be organized, fair, or balanced is mistaken.
---
wPvP was always a gank fest.
---
There is no problem to fix, the game is what it is if you don't like it don't play it. Blizzard already said they don't care if people quit, they would rather 100 people play and keep the experience authentic than cater to any changes.
---
Actually it takes 10 days. 1 bar per 8hours  (240 hours)
---
Reddit wanted no change for some reason - so we have no change.
---
That's a multiboxer tho
---
You're doing it right. You know that of course, as do I.
---
People might wake up once they see honor calculation. They might realize that with whom they actually compete, how very far away they are from their target and at the same time the easy targets dry up because they nedlessly drove them away.
---
And in time there's BGs which promise more honor per time (significantly more) and then the true realization sets in what happens if you are on the numerically larger faction both on the local server for wpvp as well as on the battlegroup for BG. And that you just killed off any chance of decent honor gain while waiting 2 hrs for the next bg to pop as well.
---
Not that people both in games and in the real world consider their actions for the future most of the time.
---
And then there's p5 where both factions need to contribute so that the Ahn'quiraj war effort progresses. Well that at least has a solution. On pve realms it just works and on pvp realms, well you have to buy another account to push the other side forwards.
---
All of this happened before. All of this will happen again.
---
Most complaints im seeing about classic atm are related to server issues and faction balance, not so much about the game itself.
---
It's not specifically balance. It's balance AND simple volume. Classic wasn't meant for this many people per server.
---
Ehh vocal minority.  
---
Don't take the bitching on reddit as representative of the entire community.  There a lot of people happily playing PvE (and a lot here who would be happier rerolling on PvE but don't because they think people will think they're "pussies" or something) and a ton of people happily playing on PvP, whether we're joining up with our own faction's PvP raids, leveling somewhere quiet, running dungeons, or leveling an alt.
---
I gave up because I can’t keep up the grind. Tried for 2 days and got 30k honor. I wanna go big or go home. Home it is.
---
If you right click the buff while active, you can cancel the speed and life/mana drain.
---
I think we’re talking about totally, totally different things.
---
I asked “what gameplay differences do you see?” and you responded by telling me about the TOS.
---
Here’s some reality check questions:
---
Do you think people bought gold in vanilla? What percentage? What percentage either bought gold or were loaned gold from a friend who bought gold?
---
Do you think non-whales buy gold in retail? What percentage? What percentage gets loaned/given gold from a whale?
---
When you see that you’re 500 gold away from your epic mount, and you can farm 25g/h, you’re looking at 20 hours of gold farming, or if you have a job that cracks 15$/h, way less time than paying someone else that already farmed.
---
The people buying gold aren’t evil or scummy, they’re people who did a time comparison calc and saw that they were better off buying.
---
As for “high” chance of getting banned? Nah. Low at best.
---
By legalizing and regulating the gold market, blizz was able to get rid of shady third parties and protect people, since they never found a way to stop the behavior.
---
As for the *impact* of buying gold, what does that gold *get* you in classic? My priest gets a slight upgrade in true faith over exalted, a slight upgrade in hide of the wild over cosmos, and an epic mount.
---
I really, really don’t see the problem.
---
It sounds stupid. Why would they bot that as locks/hunters, when it would be so much easier as druids?
---
It's mostly about mana management, which is fine because in raid's that's a huge part of healing well.
---
Get to raiding and find a spot on an established squad that had someone leave. Then get passed to a of raid loot because everyone else has it.
---
Okay, but you realize that being camped by 10 other horde for a horde at your flight point is also not fun, right?
---
Sell your herbs and xmutes. Sell your time as a tank. Reroll a hunter, mage, or warlock and do some heavy grinding.
---
That sounds incredible. I wish my server was more like that.
---
Your first mistake was thinking anyone would take a bear tank to MT/OT any raid.
---
That’s a big assumption. Also:
---
&gt; Ohh that’s pretty cool, Alliance here too and we do something similar, we send a guy first while we’re preparing in SW then we go after he arrives to let us know what to expect.
---
Only a matter of time for you.
---
LFG addon still exists though, and not much of the addon was Disabled. Go ahead, download the addon and see for yourself.
---
Blizz basically just said they were breaking the addon (and i think they did some stuff with auto invite but idk), which made the hivemind happy and the issue was never mentioned again.
---
And you're the authority on good and bad decisions? That's my point here -- you're making moral judgments and extending them into areas where your conclusions are plain wrong. 
---
Like, your ideas on personal responsibility scream of a young Republican still learning about the world -- the kind who would blame a rape victim for getting too drunk. If that's you, I worry.
---
I think all the pve servers are missing out on a huge aspect of the game. I've had some epic battles in Hillsbrad over the last week.
---
Yeah some factions are better, some classes are better, some specs are better.  Everything isn't fair and balanced like in retail.  If it bothers people they should roll whatever class/race/faction/spec/realm combo they think is overpowered.
---
gold seller.
---
Most of the private servers doubled or tripled the required mat turn-ins to force the war effort to last longer and so that all players had an opportunity to participate.
---
And Blizzard is the guy who doesn't get anything right no matter what they do to some users...
---
you can trash buff yourself, which means applying rank 1 armor, lesser invis and water breathing. so that your shadow absorb will stick.  You do not want them to run into melee to fear you, that would be the best time to use a death coil to turn the tables.  
---
Fel hunter's don't do much if they get feared at the same time you get feared, so remember to use your pet stay command if you anticipate a psychic scream.  I have had the best chances by starting out with a succubus seduce with CoS, trash buff and shadow ward, into shadow bolt fear combo then dot them up with coa instead of tongues.  Then baby sit the fear and get ready to burst them down during the third cc cycle.
---
General is way before the bar.. Confused?  
---
Unless you don't have the key then sure, you have to take the long way around.  But the common arena-general-golem farm just has you unlock the big key after the first two doors and you can do all three events sub-30 minutes easy.
---
How are you checking the accuracy?
---
Poor yall
---
Except offering server transfers.
---
Big brain tactics
---
Apparently it's nice for the benediction quest, so I'm saving it for that. And maybe Kel'Thuzad eventually.
---
I like the idea.  But it opens up the economic problem with layering again.
---
what's the website that uses WCL to give server faction distributions?
---
I imagine Earthshaker is pretty strong for 5-10 man dungeons.  
---
For MC/Ony if you got 2H fury you'll probably still do decent damage.
---
+1 for weapon swing timer. Has Hunter specific "show multishot clipping" marks for sneaking in a multi between attacks!
---
Mages are so busted in classic. In every aspect. Dps, utility, CC of all kinds, AoE, panic button.
---
Calling him a 'sociopath' because he trolled in a videogame.. ok man, maybe he is not the one with mental problems.
---
I don’t think you did anything wrong, that’s what you get when mt is a paladin, they don’t have taunt, so when they lose aggro, it’s hard for them to get mobs back....so i guess he is just tanking whatever he is tanking, and if any mobs running away from him, he expect you to pick it up since you have taunt
---
Exactly, I only heard about the add-on because of people whining about it.
---
Thanks for the tip guys, I've had it running since I learned about it - Makes killing the rogues in Ironforge a lot easier!
---
I think that's exactly what's going to happen. Majority of people won't say a thing, they're just going to unsub. Rerolling isn't an option for some people either, they've already invested days of play time, and don't want to start over.
---
Beating the mage tower challenges felt so good lol. I was ecstatic when I got my bear hulk form on druid.
---
Find a priest and a miner dps or tank and do DME Jump runs. Pick up 3-4 herb nodes and 2-3 rich thorium nodes per run, plus vendor loot and rare books.
---
Pretty sure he’s dead
---
&gt;  I worry for the servers that are already unbalanced
---
Even on balanced server and as a 60 it's annoying, reaching dungeon is a chore, questing is not possible, farming is not possible.
---
Tried PVP it's fun for a few hours but quickly become tiring, it's either roaming around killing people in smaller number without any challenge, ss/tm which is just back and forth (you can almost stay on your mount), set up a checkpoint and kill every person going to a dungeon. None of them is interesting in any way but mandatory for farming honor. You can't play alone or you'll be the target of these groups
---
Yea, it wouldnt be so awful if it wasnt for spy. You used to be able to hide. Now people know for certain that you are within range.
---
I WISH that was an Alliance exclusive role. I’ve had to body jump from Camp Mojache to DM just to get into a dungeon.
---
2+3 didn't equal 2 last I checked. Also, there were like 10 people in the whole zone, 50% of tlwhich were ganking people 10-30 levels below them. Still a shitty situation even if it's worse elsewhere.
---
How about a quest that tests your understanding and skill with a class for a custom tailored awesome weapon reward you just level to max level and get an artifact of legends just handed to you instead? 
---
Doesn't that sound much more engaging and fun than proving that you're actually worth wielding that weapon first?
---
This trinket is dogshit. I've use it over 10 times and no stun or disarm on other players.
---
If you fly into Thorium Point you deserve to get camped.
---
That’s because you can’t transfer characters from PvE to PvE servers. You have to transfer to a different PvP server, or start fresh on a PvE server.
---
You just contradicted yourself.  You first say "Why would anyone do anything 'sub-optimal'?' then say you do things sub-optimally, so which is it.  If you were min-maxing to do what is optimal, you wouldn't waste $15 on this game and sit on your ass sitting in a corner because that is more optimal financially.
---
I am loving these memes lol, but I am sooooo glad I rolled PvE this time around
---
Not really.  There was no expectation that blizz would raise the realm caps so high and still remove layering.  The population is too high and nothing like it was in Vanilla.  This is a huge change from what it was.
---
What server do you play on? A or H?
---
It’s not about the honor, it’s about sending a message
---
Enjoy your dead server in a couple weeks lol
---
Sitting in meld near a quest hub in a high level zone waiting for single targets to run by.  Not the best honor compared to some others, but I can afk, level my alt on another account...etc and pick my battles.
---
If your choice was a mage or a druid. Then yes, I'd probably pick a mage. If you already have a mage then a druid is an amazing partner. With druid cc and heals you can keep that mage up forever while doing some damage /kiting yourself.
---
It isn’t that game breaking, sure you can do all that but you have no idea where they’re coming from, if they’re just flying over head, or what. Sure it says so-and-so stealthed, but that doesn’t stop a rouge from fucking me. The only real benefit is seeing who’s around and knowing if it’s a fight worth fighting or not. And even so, it only matters for the first engagement. 
---
Alliance have been gatekeeping dire maul in two key points in my server, one at the bridge from the horde camp and directly outside of the instance. I can see 10 ally on spy, but after that it doesn’t matter because the same 10 are gonna camp me either way.
---
And changing the honor kill levels is a non-vanilla change. Bigbrain.
---
So he's just RPing an orc with a lisp.. w/e man don't take it too seriously.  If you ask someone to help with a quest by saying "My friend is sick can you help?" it's decidedly more on the RP side of things.
---
Shire Baggins... you want ring wraiths that’s how you get ring wraiths
---
&gt;And that easier to track state is the problem. Sure you can try to read the combat log. It just won't fucking allow you to actually do anything with it, because you won't be able to read 10 events per second constantly
---
Your "easier to track state" would be the point I was getting at. Here you did not say remove it you said its that its easy thats the problem not that its there.
---
&gt;Your attitude is why we have these stupid population numbers. "hurr, any server without hundreds of thousands of people will die!" so we have these crazy populations under the stupid assumption that over 90% of the playerbase will quit.
---
I'm not the one with that midnset, the general population of the game has it.  It's been shown repeatedly through wow's history.  People want to be on massive servers out of fear of the smaller servers being dead.  I'm not the one promoting it, I'm relaying the information the players have shown through their actions.
---
Also it hasn't even been 4 months and you are declaring the smaller servers will never decline while saying Blizzard was short sighted in their actions?  Ok.
---
&gt; Also, I played during the pre bg honor days on a full server with a real vanilla population cap.
---
Cool, the playerbase approaches the game significantly different now.  This was never going to be the same experience.
---
&gt;Anyone who thinks people wouldn't be able to find people to fight should stick to a topic they know about, because this isn't it.
---
I don't even know what this means.
---
If you hire people to get you rating, you're still a bad player, and people would know it.
---
Having a time-gate is even worse, because your skill level is irrelevant only time.
---
Just because there's no perfect system doesn't mean you can improve on one.
---
No they didn't. The values were the same as retail.
---
What happens when someone kills the demon? Is that not even 2 hours?
---
Do you trust modern Blizzard to implement reasonable and appropriate changes to classic?
---
They can't even figure out how to reimplement a keyring.
---
Have the doomguard any useful use?
---
&gt; Another option is 3man DM:East runs. Find a healer and a DPS and you can easily run these. Theres plenty of herbs in DM:E, on top of that you make a lot of gold from boss drops, random essences, class books and random BoEs.
---
I'd say this is your best option for the next few weeks. Pretty much all the good grinding spots mentioned above are well known and popular spots for grinding at 60, so will likely attract people looking for honorable kills.
---
2 man runs require the warrior to be pretty well geared. So 3 man is probably more viable for the majority of people.
---
Get yourself a miner (for the thorium) and enchanter (to d/e things which aren't worth selling to maximise your gp/h.
---
The thing that helped me the most in the Benediction quest was the sapling from Dire Maul East. That little guy can tank so many skeletons, and AoEs them down.
---
Ooh cool, looks pretty good
---
ba dum tss
---
Just the mental conversation I had with a Troll speaking like a nelf made me bust out laughing.
---
Thank you! (bows)
---
Yeah basically, but the conversions aren’t that straightforward
---
Its easy to spot a shitty lock.
---
The ones that constantly life tap to zero expecting a healer to keep them topped off.
---
If only that had skills like life drain, siphon life, etc. to help sustain them self while while also doing good damage. *Wouldn't that be novel?*
---
Funny joke but yuk....retail...

Actual /dueling: Shadow Priest and Warlock

Open world 1v1: Hunters
---
Bonus: Druids should be able to escape anyone in 1v1 open world
---
What’s that addon at the top?
---
fuck yes.
---
I LOVE this game right now.
---
Sneaking around as a rogue and dying CONSTANTLY.
---
Srsly i havent had so much fun in WoW in years.
---
Ahh. In the context of epic items here I thought you were talking about the sword.
---
Is rogue the smartest choice for agathering/mining alt? Vanish seems prett neat. Easy to escape and easy to stun ppl that are allready mining/gathering?
---
Poster call bullshit on something obviously false 
---
"DAMN BRO"
---
Lmao you guys are a joke. The add-on has always been here, and it can't be removed without breaking the game. Get over it. A good rogue plays around Spy, maybe you're the one who needs to get better
---
On the hunter tracker, are undead *players* in humanoids or undead category? (I assume tauren are humanoid not beasts)
---
technically I don't think we can know 100% since that'd be calculated server side, but realistically, no. Each spell should calculate resist and partial resist on their own.
---
man Im in gadgetzan constantly with ally stfu
---
its bad for us too when 60s camp 40s in ferelas but seriously a group of 4 or 5 people can do whatever they want. Make some friends.
---
Eh, as if the spell would matter that much. Sure, that's an extra bit of information you would have to read from the combat log without target cast bars. Maybe that's just me, but I'm more interested in whether they're casting, not what specifically it is they're casting.
---
Because the interest in every new shiny thing eventually fades. A lot of people will also come to the late understanding that zerging in SS/Blackrock wont get you anywhere near a high rank.
---
Alliance are dominating flight paths on my server.  I was prepared for this though as I remember these days back in vanilla,  this is part of the game we asked for.  I’m enjoying the paranoia and visceral feel of a world at war.  This is why I loved vanilla.  Yes it can be ansolutley frustrating at times,  but it can also be extremely rewarding when you call in with the guy you helped out in wailing caverns 20 levels ago and him and 4 guild mates come out to tanaris and turn the tide of pirate cove to fight off the assholes camping your body.  I’ve put te rose tinted glasses down, I was also pissed off a lot back in vanilla when I couldn’t get to a flight path and what not, but I also had some really fun memories taking back a spot that was under enemy control for a couple days and then giving the opposition pay back.  This is only temporary, and this experience of the game will be gone soon and never come back.  These are the things we should have been expecting when signing up for classic on a pvp server.  Use you’re anger young padawon, use that hate to fuel your retaliation.  Call on your guild and people you’ve interacted with and added to your friends list weeks ago to come wage war.  This is the world of WAR craft!
---
All this is meant for perspective and in no way to be mean spirited or anything.  When it gets too frustrating it’s ok to roll an alt or try a new zone.  If you’d like, pm me and I wouldn’t mind giving you some level appropriate locations to farm.
---
This phase of The game imo relies heavily on using one of the strongest things classic has over retail... community.  Reaching out to other players and banding together to overcome the bullshit.  
---
I dunno maybe I’m just a fan boy, but I’m honestly having a blast, and I’m also looking forward to BG when they come out.
---
To be fair, you ignored the advice that joining alliance would be like using sandpaper to wipe your ass come P2 which was also all over the subreddit.
---
I don’t, sorry.
---
I think it should scale, if you are too far behind they should slow down/stop, if you are near them they move the same speed as you, if you are closer than them to the destination they should speed up. I feel like devs could easily implement this but not doing so is way fucking easier so they don't bother.
---
ooh, im not multiboxing.
---
my other accounts are mostly teleport and scout twinks and character space for bank alts.
---
Re-roll a rogue
---
Just find a guild with a similar game plan as your own and finish leveling in dungeons more than questin.
---
&gt; Want to farm mats in the world? Sure lemme just hop on a second account and kill my character several times to push him down the layers. 
---
The amount of people who would create a second account, travel to an area, and then attempt to kill their own player to push them down a layer would be so minuscule, that it would be statistically insignificant. This wouldn't be a problem, whatsoever. 
---
&gt;Also you mention nothing about how grouping would affect layers.
---
It seems you didn't read the whole post. I specifically mentioned this. 
---
&gt;*"If you're in a group, you will always be moved UP layers, never down. So, you cannot delve into a lesser populated layer to farm honor, and generally cannot manipulate layers in your favor."*
---
This was literally the second sentence. Honestly, you need to stop working yourself up into an emotional frenzy over a video game.
---
Diet Coke contains aspartame which is considered healthy by industry sponsored studies.  Frankly, it might be healthy but I trust those studies about as much as I trust the tobacco industry saying smoking is safe.  I rarely consume it anymore and I wish I had done that sooner.
---
This is well written and exactly how I think about it. Free market is free market. If they are the only group forming they essentially have a monopoly and are being smart about it as opposed to being charitable. Anyone who dislikes this behaviour does not need to participate in it and instead of being the white knight to ride in and rant about this to “protect” those people who might join reserve groups just let them learn from their own mistakes.
---
Just spam dungeons, it's the best way to level on a PVP server, even easier if you're a tank/healer.
---
Battles that big just aren't fun for me, I had way more fun when I logged in early Sunday and it was a 20v20 at southshore.
---
It was nowhere near this severe, the realm pops were a lot lower and there were very few 60s at any given time compared to now. Couple that with just better understandings of everything that increases peoples effectiveness in PvP and it becomes a bit tiresome for many people.
---
Play Alliance on Horde populated server and you'll be bitching yourself in not time.
---
Yeah it's fricken sweet, that's what it is
---
Little tip for Artorious (and any mob that will evade in the open world)--you need to use a direct damage attack every 8 seconds or so to keep mobs from evading. Serpent sting doesn't cause any direct damage, so use rank 1 arcane shot to keep it in combat (costs very little mana and it's instant cast so you never have to stop moving).
---
And then I immediatly said as well that I want to remove the entire thing in the first place.
---
There are many problems to fix.. that we've known for literally a generation. Just because you don't want to acknowledge them doesn't mean they aren't there
---
Sure you can use the "just don't play" nonargument, but that's just weak deflection from talking about how to make the game better.
---
They expected 90% dropout in 1 month. The "crazy" people have been saying way before Classic release, that the dropout won't be even close to 90%, more like 40%, maybe 50% in 1-2 months.
---
As it was proven, with all the announcements (added servers, increased server capacity, removal of layering), the dropout rate at 3 month was most likely under 50%, and on popular servers (more than half of the total), the dropout was even lower.
---
Hence, Blizzard's "plans" to have servers with 12-15k concurrent players at launch, with a reasonable 2-3k left in 1-2 months, was proven to be dead wrong : medium servers now have 5-6k concurrent while high / full more than 8k.
---
There are no solutions to this major Blizzard fuck up. Classic is too popular. The dropout rates, while increasing in P2 (due to many casuals on PvP servers simply quitting or stopping playing till P3), won't be enough to have a NORMAL population.
---
We will have to put up with this until BGs are live, and I hope they come as soon as possible, for Classic health. It is one thing to have WPvP in Vanilla, with 2-3 concurrent players spread all over Azeroth, and another thing is Classic WPvP, with 6-8k or more players spread across the same Azeroth.
---
Nochanges, sure. But if we want Classic to resemble Vanilla, BGs must come ASAP. For the sake of the game.
---
Mmm Land's End Beach?
---
If you really aren't into PvP you're going to end up not wanting to log on. Check for free transfers, you might be lucky. Otherwise I would make a char on a pve server and make some new friends.
---
If you dislike pvp, the mistake was made 53 levels ago. That being said the honor system has been out less than a week so it is much more insane than it will likely be later on. If you want to never be ganked again then I'd reroll. If you feel like you can still have fun when it calms down and you're getting killed less/are 60 then I'd not take the time to level all the way up again.
---
I don't really care, just stating how i see it :P
---
Well - i dont camp flightmasters but we were a 6 guild group that roamed the lands and ganked questing people / other PvP groups and it was TONS OF FUN.
---
havent had so much fun in this game for years.
---
Its honestly hillarious to see warlocks complain. Sincerely, a warrior.
---
All players are humanoid only
---

---
Consider the idea of learning why people are bitching and moaning instead of being a prick
---
Can’t 10v40 to enter dungeon 
---
“Get gud lol”
---
always 15-20 minutes regardless of scenario (i don't remember exact specifics). never 2 hours for any reason.
---
IMO, if you're not having fun getting ganked all the time, re-roll on a PvE server. I'm in a similar situation. Rolled on Sulfuras PvP to play with a friend, but he's not on as much as I am, and I got tired of doing the corpse run. Re-rolled on Ashkaandi PvE, and I'm having a much less frustrating experience.
---
ITT: People who have no idea what "game breaking" means and what Spy actually does.
---
"Game breaking" means it crashes the game/the server. It doesn't do that.
---
Spy reads out the combat log and puts it into a more readable form. Every DPS and threat meter does this as well. As well as other addons like DMB.
---
Get lost.
---
The spell the does more aggro, less damage, hurts you every second, and has 40 yards less range than the basic mage aoe spell?
---
I’m out of the loop on this. What’s causing these death memes?
---
Sad warrior noises
---
You don't seem to know what dishonorable kills are. It's only for civilian NPCs, there is no penalty for killing low level players.
---
Well if you solo play id reroll. Want to do professions in the world? Want to casually pug dungeons? How about keeping buffs while traveling to raids? Pvp will happen in those situations and if you don't like it you'd be better served to fix it asap. Even on down the line you may want an alt, do you really want to try to level and face unwinnable opponents?
---
Time and place man. Time and place.
---
You no your a asshole when you correct someones correct spelling.
---
Unless Blizzard decides to include the shop in Classic, nope.
---
It was a bad attempt at calling WPVP defenders fat and cancerous.  Should of said toxic.   I’ve failed and people are focusing on coke and Diet Coke :(
---
Spy addon is great. It makes my time on a pvp so much more enjoyable. Fuck wpvp and getting one-shoted by no life 60s.
---
You always get 1 leather per skin. You average 1-4 min per kill. You do it a nighttime, not during prime time. It was about 3 hours 15 minutes though. Believe or or dont, its your loss not mine :p
---
Perfect. Now you just need a time machine.
---
I can give my critique on here for free. WoW on the other hand I pay monthly.

See, the scenario I encountered yesterday wasn't even about farming honor. I wanted to level my mage alt, thought I'd be fine logging in spawning in at Redridge, and immediately I see 9 Lv 60 Horde all camping the bridge/flight path of Lakeshire. As soon as I saw them all collapse onto a Lv 15 Alliance minding his own business and murder him instantly, I knew it wasn't worth it. So what was the point of this? There's no honor to be gained, and these people decided that it would make for good gameplay to camp this insanely low level area just to grief and are probably thinking "wow these lowbies must be so mad!!"
---
My first instinct was to hop onto my Lv 60 Rogue main, fly down there and start picking people off. As soon as I kill a Druid that was straggling behind his group and then kill him again upon spawning, the entire group disappears.
---
So this makes me think they weren't in it for honor, they just wanted to kill lowbies with zero retaliation or chance of defeat. So when people say honor is ruining the state of the game, how would one explain a situation like the one I encountered here?
---
The seat doesn't belong to Cruz, you can't "steal" an elected position.  Well, you can through election fraud, but I don't think that applies here.  That said, I feel quite sorry for you Texans, having to pick between a particularly stupid neoliberal and the zodiac killer.
---
I think phase 2 is great. It really makes the whole in game world feel like a war between the 2 factions. Just like it's meant to be.
---
In retail you just get mass dispelled/shattered no?
---
You talk too much.
---
yeah, just like any raider would say "oh you dont use a dbm/bigwigs or threat meter addon, you bad"
---
/castsequence reset=combat totem1, totem2, totem3, totem4
---
4 clicks.
---
Yeah eventually a bunch of lvl 60 alliance showed up and cleaned out the both and both docks, so I was able to head off on my way. It was entertaining to watch lol
---
Yeah man, I get it, 15yrs isn’t enough time for some people to figure this out.
---
But what about the death squads rolling in groups of 5-10 around WPL picking off lvl 50 players?
---
Yup you can walk right up to someone with Spy and you won't show up on their list if you do nothing, have no aura gains, etc.
---
No fucking way, what about paranoia ( felhunters pet)
---
Also the most playable feature in all of vanilla. FOMO is absolutely blinding you to how mundane this phase is.
---
Not really. The servers are WAY overcrowded. It was never like this in vanilla.
---
I don’t believe a conditional exists for checking if something is inventory, just currently equipped. And even then equipped only checks for type (like shields), not specific items IIRC. So I don’t think this is doable.
---
How? pick a popular enough flight point and youre literally being fed kills
---
ClassicLFG didn't get axed though. It still works fine and honestly IDK what they "broke" if anything. 
---
I think they made some tweaks to how addons can auto invite and then claimed the addon was now "broken" and nobody cared anymore.
---
Were they warned server balance would be gutted to two rounds of ffa transfers off high pop servers?
---
But why should one faction log more than the other?
---
I think the website is perfectly adequate for determining the ratio.
---
I play on PvE so there's no personal risk, but atm the organized wpvp does make it somewhat unquestable  due to town raids lmao
---
All this and you still couldn’t hit print screen.
---
Warlock buff detects your invis pot.
---
But how would you turn right then?
---
Please no. I already get enough whispers. Ive just stopped selling the water completely. Its so annoying to get ask several times an hour. I just dont respond anymore.
---
A strategic combo of both. If you're solo chaining quests as you are constantly killing mobs to and from location is the fastest.
---
The alternative if you have a higher level buddy willing to boost you of course is instance aoe farming, or open world elite grinding by tagging a mob and having your high level buddies blow up the mob.  The latter is really good if you are rested (such as being level 30-38 farming RFD elites or Blue Dragons in Azshera on your way to 60).
---
I mean yeah open pvp is fun if it's somewhat balanced.
---
Getting fucked by atleast 1 40 man raid at every high lvl flight point  or having to corpserun for 20 min to get into a instance is suprinsingly not that fun.
---
&gt; The real issue is calling kills on people ~10 lvls below you as “honorable”. What honor is there in killing a lvl 50 when you’re 60?
---
It's honorable, just not nearly as honorable as killing a 60.  A 60 rogue tried to gank my 49 mage the other day and lost.  You stand a chance at this lvl, just are at a large disadvantage.
---
Not sure if you realize that if even more people played horde based on your comment, there would be a bigger imbalance. Aside from the few outlier servers, alliance are typically outnumbered, moreso now than in vanilla because more people are about the min maxing now and the loads of data and information out there show that horde have the racial advantages.
---
It will drop, not to non-existent levels, but it will drop.  I've already seen a noticeable drop on my server and it's about 4 days later.  There are plenty of try hard who will keep something going, but I would like to see how it plays out over the next lockout period before any decides anything significant.
---
I'd rather either have actual no changes or actually polishing up the game like every other remake of a game has ever done in the history of gaming. This hybrid of "we say nochanges when convenient, but add crap like layering and massive populations" is the worst of both worlds. Now we have populations that are insanely non vanilla while adding in idiotic artificial lag with spell batching and melee leeway. 
---
And it isn't like making tiny adjustments kills anything, anyway. Just look at private servers and the 0 people who complained about the cheaper respec costs that allow people to switch things up on raid night. Or not even counting that, the laundry list of things they straight up got wrong that didn't kill the game. And none of those are changes that put things on a slipperly slope to the real post vanilla issues (flying mounts, lfr, class simplification). 
---
I'm fine with actual #nochanges. It is a silly hard line stance to take, but whatever. What I don't like is being told #nochanges for things that will significantly improve the game (lowering of spell batching window), but then getting exceptions for way more disruptive changes like server population augmented with layering. At least a #somechanges approach would have made logical improvements.
---
Yep. I'm 58 and just hit a wall. I literally cannot quest in any zone. And yeah dungeon runs are great... but i need about 4 hours, with at least an hour to an hour and a half of that time dedicated to assembling a group and doing corpse runs while we try to zone in.

1v1 as a rogue isn't exactly "fair" unless it's against a mage or maybe a hardcore warrior

Once bgs come out the game will never be like this again. Even tho it can be rough for the 50+ crowd or unbalanced servers. This is truly a unique time for the game

I'm pvping and I just don't like it as much as I like BG's.
---
Here you, 50 ally priest on horde dominated server. Like the pister above me said, level an alt for the time being. 
---
Also playing to have fun and dont want to "miss" out on the last 10 (best) levels so I am doing the same. It will get better
---
I'm finding that nonsense annoying as well, but I think it'll get better. It's already died down a bit on my server compared to what was going on Thursday and Friday where every single flight path and boat was camped by raid groups. I was able travel around, turn in some quests, and even do a little bit of fishing yesterday afternoon without much trouble. 
---
I'd say try and stick it out with a guild running some dungeons. Spam BRD to level, get some gear, and see how it goes in a couple weeks. I have a feeling that this outcry will cause blizzard to release some BGs sooner rather than later, which will help a lot.
---
Great comment! Tons of material!
---
hahaha that was awesome GG
---
&gt;I am entitled to a grief free experience even on a pvp server. 
---
Wrong
---
&gt;The truth is you are not entitled to enjoyment of the game at mine or anyone else's expense.
---
Correct.
---
No one is entitled to anything.
---
I'm not expecting people to abandon their servers. I'm baffled on why people are complaining that pvp is happening on their pvp server they chose to play on.
---
He’s trolling. Let it slide. 
---
Trolling or a complete idiot that doesn’t actually play... whichever is worse honestly.
---
You could afford an epic mount before reaching lvl 60, something you either grinded an insane amount for or paid real money for, then quit the game 45 minutes later?
---
That’s seriously annoying. I started healing UBRS runs at 55 and never heard a complaint from the guys I started running with. The first time they invited me to go with them I was like “nah I’m too low, I don’t think i would be very effective” and they basically told me “nah bro, it’ll be fine. Just come get some loot.” 
---
Like yeah, my aggro range was pretty ridiculous and it certainly made specific spots a little tense, but it was fun. Didn’t get fuck all for experience but at least the loot drops were nice.
---
&gt; Gold farmers are either botting 
---
Ummmm. Yes..... Gold farmers are botting.... that's what I said. So thanks for agreeing with me I guess? 
---
I'm not going to cite shit for you. There are posts/videos about bots everyday on this subreddit alone. And feel free to go search for WoW gold selling websites to see how many of them there are out there. 
---
If you don't think farmers running Bots would push their bots to a lower layer to increase the amount they can farm without being killed..... then you are delusional.
---
Rogue is prob the best class for mining I guess outside of warriors for jump runs.
---
oh.
---
Yo can I get a link to your full blog? lol
---
For real though, this is the exact reason I went PVE this time around, I don't have much time to play nowa' days compared to when I was 13, it's actually not that bad, there's a ton of world PVP events that you can join if you really want to do world PVP, and it's super comfy leveling without the worry of being camped and ganked for 9 hours haha
---
i find him funny?
---
The feeling of discovery and the organic feel of vanilla was gone and can never occur again. People knew where to level and in what order to do quest or farm. People knew exactly what gear they needed and where/how to get it. And world pvp is no different. People planned for it and it feels forced and artificial. We knew thats what we were getting but for alot of people the reality of it cheapens the experience.
---
No, what I'm saying is that these people entering MC could've done the same thing the same way if they'd done it all sometime after August 22nd, 2006 and before December 5th, 2006. There are very few changes between Classic and the version of Vanilla a few months prior to the launch of Burning Crusade. Classic WoW was never intended to replicate the 2004 version of the game besides the "clean slate" element mixed with some time-gating, so we shouldn't compare Classic to patch 1.0.
---
I could possibly get there, but the others won't. They are playing the game all day, every day. They might do two or three runs then they'll get bored, leave and I'm hunting for pugs again.
---
Don't get me wrong, if I'm determined to dungeon then I could. But I'll get bored doing it during the second run. Any hops back to town though to sell shit or repair armour will result in trying to get back again. You don't survive without your gear on, but it'll be completely broken if you do.
---
My best bet is to give it two weeks and see if people are bored of phase 2 honor grinding. During week 1, I'm just a quest mob in an spawn-camped area.
---
So GTA?
---
Los can be up to 100 yards away. That's how far the combat log works.
---
You paladins are so cute when you bubble to prolong the inevitable
---
I knew what to expect because I played back in vanilla.  I don’t think that being ganked by a raid of horde is what some thought it was when they signed up for “PVP”.
---
It is a bit of a scary social experiment in a way.  You have people that will camp out and slaughter other people in a game in mass.  Mostly for the promise of a reward that few of them will actually realize.
---
The hinterlands escort, oh no the nightmares
---
Exactly. Yesterday I grouped with a rogue and we stalked and ambushed 2 shamans who were killing mobs we needed. FUN. 
---
Then I got ganked by a geared to the teeth rogue with glowing swords. I saw a fellow hunter also standing by his corpse who was killed by the same guy. As soon as the rogue attacked a mob I whispered "get him" and we both ressed, opened, and barely killed him. FUN.
---
Then 3 skulls camped me as I tried to take a boat... NOT FUN.
---
Are you between the levels of 50 and 60 and are you trying to quest to 60?  If not, then you have no opinion and cannot possibly understand the plight of those people.  And if you are trying to quest 50-60 and you love it then you're a masochist lol.
---
nice opinion mate, I'll file it under, dumb opinions.

&gt;Solenor teaches how to maximize your DPS while moving.
---
If you do it with a WL, it sadly doesnt teach you anything. There is a lot more foresight and range awareness needed if you do him like intended
---
I'm getting down voted because its easier to complain on this platform then get a group of people together and go and actually do some pvp. What did people who are playing a on pvp server think was going to happen?
---
&gt; Protection against Cheating, Data Mining, Macroing, all the Mods that dumb everything down and tell you what to do.
---
SWTOR didn't use cloud gaming, but it does ban for macros/mods. Can't even add more quickbars because they want to sell them.
---
It's awful. They didn't include necessary features into the base game. No mouseover healing is a huge pain in the ass. No addon to vendor junk. A lot of minor features that need patched up.  It gets tedious. I appreciate it to some extent, because the default hud is very usable. It's a lot less hassle in that regard, but it needs a bit more flexibility.
---
1500 cone of cold?
---
I don't even crit that high with full pre bis + like 6 good epics. So he has to be extremely well geared.
---
The Chest of 7 drops the Hammer of grace. I think DM drops an offhand
---
It's not a bug, just the mechanics of swimming topwater. Swim just beneath the surface and you should be fine! Better that way anyways, considering swimming submerged is much stealthier than swimming on the surface to those around you. I also find that it's usually more off-putting to gankers that do spot me if I'm swimming about 10 feet under as well, because, well... who wants to chase after that.
---
Seems strange I’ve seen shorter letters on redit
---
see alliance are scum this proves it
---
have you have you likened it to a "choir" because, like the choir boys of yesteryear, you are getting totally buggered every session?
---
Raid and honor farm with priest. The team with the most healers win most random BG's. Priests are always in demant and dispell is OP.
---
You can always have fun pvping on your mage without being gear dependent. Mages are usefull even without good gear.
---
I'm glad some of us are able to have fun with it at least.
---
Someone with your toxic attitude should not even be around kids.
---
Unbalance is expected. The total ratio of horde:alliance on all of the PvP servers is probably what, 55-45? Maybe 60-40 at worst? So how can you expect better than that on your own individual server? I know I don't. 
---
But it would be nice if my server was anything close to that - but it's probably 80-20. 60-40 would be amazing.
---
It's just me or all that Horde say ever is "kaz dogg we are fucking stupid no brain kaz dogg" ?
---
Fish duh...
---
I'd say an undead rogue with cold blood can reliably beat a SPriest 1v1 but hey that's just my opinion ;)
---
I recommend landing at lakeshire and running up through Burning Steppes. It’s a little out of the way but you’ll save time in the long run. For the most part you won’t run into horde until the ramp to BRM.
---
How is it so hard to understand that pvp is going to occur on a pvp server? The game has been out since 2004, what did you think was going to happen on a pvp server? If its too difficult then roll on a pve server plain and simple.
---
I've heard conflicting reports on that, but I'll be testing it by hand sometime in the coming weeks.
---
I told you why.  People are complaining because the experience expected and the experience delivered are miles apart.
---
People expected PVP.  I expected PVP.  Phase 1 had PVP.  What's going on now is another animal entirely.
---
Or on a rotation, for the gank squad. 
---
My ONY raid had to corpse run into the instance and we lost a few (33/40) due to horse camping the Thermore boat. 
---
It’s bad. This Hfrog dude just doesn’t play, isn’t level 60, or he’s a troll.
---
Do you know why Spy is known so widespread? Because of crying post like that. People like OP made the situation worse.
---
Those are some very rose colored glasses you have.  They seem to be very popular too.
---
I played WoW on a PvP server from the closed beta until just a little into Cataclysm.  I came back briefly for Warlords of Draenor to give it another try and see how things were.  When Classic came around, my friends and I who had all originally been on PvP servers all agreed that we should roll on a PvE server.  Why?  Because we ALL remembered that while open world PvP is fun at times, being corpse camped and steamrolled is not, and you always experienced more of the latter unless you were a die-hard PvPer back in the day.  So we knew it would be better to be on a server where we could have the option if we wanted to take it instead of having no choice.
---
None of this was a surprise to me or in any way inconsistent with my memories of the original release of the honor system.  I sympathize for those who didn't know what was going to happen because they never experienced it.  Adapt as best you can and wait for BGs, that does make things a little better.  But now that honor is released, ganking will remain rampant even if it does calm down.  There is nothing you can do about it.  Unfortunately, this \*is\* the Classic experience on a PvP server.
---
Side note - I wrote a paper for a college class back when vanilla was out about anonymity in online interactions and how it had a tendency to bring to the surface a lot of negative traits because there are no consequences for being a horrible person.  I used WoW as a specific example.  This behavior is not new.  It existed from the very beginnings of online gaming.  There are also still people who are decent to each other even if they'll never be recognized for it, just as there ever were.
---
So what is melee supposed to do against mage?
---
Look, the time it took me to get to 55 (roughly 2 months I came a bit later to classic) I would be willing to pay 15 bucks instead of losing another 2 months to level a new char. I played on a pvp server in vanilla and I definitely don’t remember it like this. That’s why I rolled on one again. You’d pick a halfway even victim to fight against others. But hand of rag warrior against a 54 warlock who has only half his health and then spawn camp him another 3 times... that dude must just massively overcompensate
---
cool story
---
This is the only comment that doesn't give an excuse of complaining that pvp is happening on a pvp server.
---
but this time it isn't the Priests
---
We had no pots and our tank had ony neck :/ lucky I guess with pug
---
Nope, just a wow sub
---
Healing in PvP with a group coordinating is very fun.
---
You knew you were picking the minority faction on a PVP server though? Any PVP server, the majority faction is Horde. Plenty of Alliance dominated PVE servers... Really makes you wonder doesn't it.
---
Those who do this on purpose relish the challenge. Not shy away from it.
---
Or, OR

transfer your char to a low pop server.
---
As a level 48-49 alliance experiencing the same thing, what I can suggest is that you simply don’t take the game too seriously that it actually frustrates you. Leveling shouldn’t be the only goal in your limited play time. Just log in, get lost in the world, and don’t get negatively emotionally attached to anything.
---
No, only have an active subscription.
---
alright ty
---
The experience varies with mileage. 
---
Keep in mind, this 15 y/o game has an unwritten etiquette that has been retained and changed over those years. IMO:
---
\- Everyone should know their pre-bis since it won't take away your journey in item progression to get there (Seriously, just utilize the time used by people theorycrafting. It is a huge QOL)  
---
\- In pug groups, expensive BOE items (righteous orbs, freezing band etc) are ALWAYS a need. This will prevent any ninjaing of an item everyone can make use of either by equipping said item or selling it. (Per-group decision to pass to someone IF there's a direct need for said item, such as Edgemaster's for a melee class)  
---
\- If a player wants a reserved item or to limit competition, they should build their own group accordingly or make a guild group. advertising a reserved item group is silly and only encourages the server to make fun of you and potentially not group with you since reserving items in a pug kinda shows your level of greed and selfishness
---
We may not all be part of the same guild or social clique, but we all have to play together on the servers we chose. Better to get along with your neighbors than have them constantly shitting on your lawn, right?
---
PvP Servers have always been horde dominant.
---
nax is wotlk
---
Ashkandhi is medium-high, no server issues.  Decent people.
---
You dont think multiple tiers of dungeons and raids being way easier because the players are way stronger is a massive fucking change?
---
The difficulty of MC now and when people originally entered it is wildly different.
---
Its entirely situational for each servers. On my server its quite even split so its ideal.
---
On some of the zoomer / streamer / bs servers like Feralina or Herod, its about as busted as it can be due to the massive pop imbalance.
---
All these salty people here complaining about getting camped. If you played vanilla when honor was added it was also a nightmare to go anywhere without getting ganked. It will cool down when 90% of them realise they don't even have a chance to reach rank 8. They will go back to what they were doing before and gank here and there. 
---
You'll still have the camps at certain high traffic points. But nothing like it is now. 
---
Give it a few weeks. Stop complaining.
---
Who actually pays 10g for a transmute? I never pay more than 8.
---
&gt; dozens upon dozens of "bitching about Spy" 
---
Followed by the same lame lies about combat logs you clowns make up. 
---
Ill say it again:
---
If the combat log has the same functionality like you cheaters all claim.... USE THE COMBAT LOG AND DELETE SPY.

Doesn't help that there's no Curse of Nature to buff them or ele shamans.
---
Your right,  but almost all of them are.
---
If you are willingly roll Need on a non-BiS while knowing it is someone else's BiS, you are a scumbag for rolling on it. You will likely replace that item soon whereas they may keep it even past BWL.
---
Why not throw on some healing/stam gear, and heal the raids? Same honor.
---
In vanilla I would often barely escape onto flight master and then get ganked as soon as I landed next zone over. The experience for me is the same. Not as extreme but the same. If you aren't 60 you f'd up. Play an alt grind in dungeons, make a party for a quest that'd you would do solo it's the only way for the minority faction to deal
---
You realize the update has been out for not even a week right? WPVP is going to die down, then even more when BG's are released.
---
The real solution would have been to make more servers up front, and then if servers dropped to be "dead" either merge or allow free server transfers *off* of dead servers and onto moderate pop servers.  
---
Then restrict transfers to some servers based on faction imbalance, and you have a lot smaller problem than we have today.  But indeed, the time to fix it was yesterday.  
---
The best thing they could do now is release BG's within 1 month, but not release their rep rewards until phase 3 officially drops with BWL.
---
Why? Just let em hit you? You'll live anyway
---
Can you get it at 58? Mage friends tried getting the quest and couldn’t until 60
---
Total immunity to everything for 10 seconds. One time use. Can never get another one.
---
Rather than assume OP is a dick, I'm thinking that the guy probably told him to keep 5g. That's why I asked, not that it matters either way, I'm just curious. 
---
I'd have done the same thing if I was the guy buying water. The dude was probably just happy to have some of it back and said keep some for yourself.
---
Doesnt change the fact you have to remember to press a button/keybinding
---
This is the reason why it won't get banned.  The add on just reads from the combat log.  Even in vanilla, I had a separate tab for the combat log so I could see if there were opposing faction players nearby.
---
I get why people are upset but you can't say NO CHANGES and then be mad about this.  The functionality was already in the game.
---
48+ provides honor. anything else is dead. unless you have a fishingpole  out. i still honor the great fishing treaty.
---
If you're generating too much threat, drop CoA as it is a backloaded DoT. Corruption + Shadow Bolt are your main for trash mobs. Let the tank get aggro for 2-4 seconds before you cast anything.
---
Getting to the dungeon takes like two hours corpse crawling to them, though. Tried running something with my friends and the group disbanded before we even got to the instance because people logged off due to getting corpse camped non-stop by Alliance on Heartseeker.
---
The min-maxing shit is infuriating, so is backseat playing.
---
This game is 1,000x easier than it used to be, god forbid anyone is challenged in this game.
---
I'm guessing the OP is level 60 on the favored faction. I've never heard of someone having fun in this situation who is not both of those.
---
Quested in Felwood on Saturday then in WPL Sunday.  Made good progress towards 55, knocking out quests.  Most deaths were on roads or in the open by main travel ways.  Never was jumped when I was using terrain to my advantage.  People aren't combing the hills, the world is too big.  People are using the logic of minimal effort, max gain.  So roads, easy targets, or targets of opportunities are the majority of kills.  People aren't using Spy addons to track player's activities.  It's too much of a hassle.  They just run around on 100% mounts and find players.  No scanning required with half a brain.
---
So, use your toolkit and class to better protect yourself.  Fight the mobs in the back of the area, not the ones near the road.  If you are dying frequently while waiting for a quest mob to spawn, wait in ghost form for it to pop then res and blow everything to kill it immediately.
---
Keep your eyes open and watch around you.  I turned in a quest at Chromie in Andorhal with one death at the front door.  After that, smart ressing meant I could turn in and run out without another death.
---
If you are persistent and stubborn, you will outlast the gankers.  Use your abilities, use resources like WoWhead for spawn locations, use your common sense.  Don't pull that hard mob while you know there are hostiles in visual range.  Don't assume that player is friendly.  Don't needlessly attack the other faction.  Fighting begets more fighting.  And if you give a hostile player grief first or camp them, you will be outed in local and you will be swarmed.  Small satisfaction now for a long frustration afterwards.
---
Try running through the edges of a zone, Felwood is great for this.  While there are choke points at multiple locations, you can easily traverse the length of the zone without a death by using the eastern side.  Players won't be camping here and anyone attempting to chase you will probably aggro mobs in their pursuit and risk being dazed.
---
A mage kindly let me kill a quest mob before turning on me.  I outlasted his mana, barely, and when he ran a short distance to evocate safely, I mounted and ran.  Take your windows of opportunity when they appear.  I stopped running from a hunter later, thinking I could kill a zombie.  But I was still on the same path that I fled on, so they caught up and killed me.  Had I juked across the water, they wouldn't have found me.
---
&gt;But i know for certain that Vanilla Combat Log detected ANY enemy player casts/attacks, not just those against you/other players.
---
That it did for sure. But I don't think it detecting players simply because they had buffs. You can evade spy by being unbuffed but if you are a warrior then it will always detect you since a stance counts as a buff as well. I am pretty sure it was different but not 100% sure myself.
---
As a 55 Holy Priest(Horde), I agree 100%.
---
Have I got ganked by lvl 60s multiple times? Yes!
---
Have I got mad about it? No!
---
It's apart of the game and personally I think it's great.
---
Not worth it. You're already lvl 53 and the best way to grind from 53-60 is to run instances. Can't get ganked inside an instance.
---
Oh you mean you don't like the flight path at the top of the zone that's literally next to nothing and the quest hub at the bottom?
---
&gt; The difficulty of MC now and when people originally entered it is wildly different
---
The charts show there was a huge rise of players coming to wow in 2006, so chances are it is more likely players were entering and raiding MC with items from 2006 than from 2005.
---
5 gold is average on my server and what I sell it for. I remember it going for that in vanilla
---
Except the population “hating” p2 is only a fraction of overall classic population.
---
It only affects pvp servers to start with and I am pretty sure more people like it than hate it. It sucks getting ganked while leveling but that was always a pvp server reality. 
---
Comes p3 things will normalize again, but regardless of any of that, it seems that majority of “pure” classic players dont have any will to go back to retail.
---
Pay someone to boost you in instances if you can't stand being ganked. Just because you cannot bother to find another way of reaching your goal does not mean it is not there.
---
Or find some strange place with no quest mobs to grind in, avoid populated areas at the least.
---
Wow, you're complaining about PvP on grobb as an alliance?
---
Delicious, proud of the boys making you contemplate qutting.
---
This guy was obviously talking about neckbreads though, you know those people with bread for necks.
---
5% hit its the cap for PvP. There is always a 1% chance to miss any mob/player.
---
Daggers can be real bursrty so pretty good from pack to pack in groups, but lag on longer boss fights. It's a tradeoff. Burst seems fun tho, if I get a good dagger in probably going to switch
---
In my experience, there was a really high turn around rate for GMs.
---
i know its a joke you dimwit
---
Just curious, what PvP server isn't a complete shit show to play on?
---
Lmfao I play on Alliance idiot
---
The real change is that we're not getting any balance changes at all.  They were a regular thing back in vanilla.
---
I'll tell you my idiot story, it's practically as bad.
---
So, in wrath of the lich King when the mementos were around that made a ghost follow you.
---
I followed around this one memento ghost, i was a younger stupid kid at the time, and I kept asking the ghost, how are you a ghost? What class are you? I was berating this ghost with questions. Just some lost haunted soul. Stranded out infront of ironforge, with a small gnome warlock talking his ear off.
---
I agree with you.  I’ll take it a few steps further and say that I get a lot of “I don’t need any drops from there” in response.  Scholomance is the main culprit, but people seem to forget that you also get Argent Dawn rep and can get scourgestones.  I generally run whatever someone in /g wants to run, but I guess I’m weird.
---
I'm very familiar with how it works and how it's currently "impossible" to ban without affecting the functioning of numerous other mods. 
---
Also, I am no BUTTERCUP and also use the mod so...
---
I rolled a PvE server (Atiesh) following a good friend but they recently stopped playing, and not sure if they'll come back. I'm 54 about to ding 55 on my main and I'm wondering if I should play my PvP server alt instead, get my main to 60 first anyway then level the PvP alt, or just stick with my PvE server.
---
A couple things to consider. I would have preferred a PvP server for the WPvP, but I also play on my couch with my laptop, and I don't use a mouse. I do this for most games as I prefer relaxing and watching TV, and in most games I use an Xbox 1 controller to play. 
---
So in WPvP fights I probably wouldn't be able to compete very well due to not playing with a mouse. PvE is much easier because the only thing I'm lacking is quick turning. Using keybindgs, addons, tab targeting, and my trackpad allows me to PvE almost as well as with a mouse (I do have one and tried at my desk to compare). However I feel like PvP encounters I'll almost always lose without having that quick turn radius from a mouse. 
---
So, any thoughts from those playing similar to how I do on if it would be worth re rolling to PvP? 
---
I never enjoyed WPvP much in vanilla so once BGs come out I can get my fix there. But I'm also not 60 yet so I don't know if I'll miss WPvP in the future, even though raiding will be my main end game activity. 
---
Since I'm almost 55 on my main on PvE I'm thinking I should just get him to 60, then level my PvP alt up if i miss the WPvP after a while. 
---
Also Atiesh has been organizing WPvP raids nonstop since P2 dropped so there is definitely WPvP to enjoy if I want to. 
---
Thanks for any input!
---
This comment here is a surefire way to spot a complete fucking idiot playing WoW.
---
yes mind vision and /petattack makes addons like these so facking broken i wish they remove it asap and its coming from a lock that probably boosted my honor by 50% because of this addon
---
If you aren't gonna use the bar yourself, then you're probably gonna sell it on the AH, and then by the time the AH takes it's cut, you only made 6-7g anyway. Maybe you're the only with the mental disability ;)
---
Same can be said about  
---
cast bars, count down from the moment the spell was cast  
---
buff timers, count down from the moment the buff was cast  
---
mob health, take damage done, percentage of hp before and after damage, calculate remaining and total health.  
---
And more. They are functionalities in the game that addons make easier, just like Spy. I'd like the addon to be broken, but as long as it isn't I'll keep using it, thanks.
---
The chore of leveling a rogue has paid dividends now that p2 is live.
---
Can't find ways to lure them away or break them up?  Yes, you're bad.
---
Imagine being this angry all the time.  Probably explains a lot of the behavior right now.
---
So in phase 1 the NPCs were the content, in phase 2 you are the content. The fact that you exists at all make it fun to a certain type of person to come kill you. You fighting makes it even more entertaining to them
---
o k b o o m e r
---
Excellent post.
---
I feel the time save from this is longer than it takes the mage to craft all that water.
---
Best time for wow pvp.
---
Once bgs come out the world pvp will die.
---
exactly lol 
---
I get so pissed going to western plaguelands to lvl only to be camped by about 4 rogues a paladin and a warrior.
---
But dangit I wouldnt change a thing.. a year from now phase 2 is going to be an awesome memory
---
What kind of insane train of logic are you using here?  You are trying to argue that players killing players in the world isn't world PvP?  That is literally the definition of world PvP.  You just don't like that it is currently incentivised so a lot of people are doing it.  Sounds like you should have rolled PvE server.  I play alliance on sulfuras btw, before anybody suggests I play horde.
---
But then what happens when BGs come out? The type of people who go on PvE servers specifically go on them to avoid world PvP entirely, and the only reason we are seeing it here in Phase 2 is because people *have to* if they want to get honor rewards.
---
There's a reason we chose PvP servers despite the shitshow Phase 2 made, because the alternative is being unable to find any world PvP at all after Phase 2.
---
Holy assumptions batman
---
Are there any raiding Guilds on the PvP realm Kirtonos that don't raid past 10:30pm realm time looking for a active 60 Mage?
---
Did you forget when this game was made?
---
just get the ridiculous spy addon and cheat your way to perfect awareness like everyone else
---
Was just innocently killing mobs in Un'goro, then some hunter set us up the bomb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnaZYtvKQso
---
I'll be sure to come to the event now. RRRrrReeeEEeee
---
As a rogue I don't find my griefing abilities hindered with spy users. It may say a stealthy is nearby but after 5 or 10 seconds people forget about me. I can still do my shenanigans fine
---
You guys really love convincing yourselves there's a correlation between faction and skill lmao.
---
It's so you stop farming people you clearly outgear/outcheese. I can't believe there are players that actually think it shouldn't work that way.
---
Sorry you can't farm the same level 48 over and over again for honour OP. Gitgud
---
This is actually how these sorts of quests work nowadays in WoW, they'll yell "Keep up!" or whatever  if you get left behind, and go slightly faster (sometimes run) if you are ahead of them, it's great!
---
What’s the context?
---
This is plain stupid. What if you want to create an alt on the same realm, you can't? What if you decide to start fresh on a realm with a few friends, 4 manage to create a char but the 5th one can't, he gotta wait? What if you just need a bank alt for your main, not allowed?
---
No, This is plain stupidity. Faction based queues however.
---
Works just fine for me.
---
this addon is like a perfectly ”legal” wallhack it needs to go
---
I think spy needs an arrow that directs to where a rogue stealthed and where he's moving, because knowing someone stealthed near me just isn't enough information.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
This goes the other way though.  What if they opened a bunch new servers and then player attrition was much higher and people bitched about being on dead servers?
---
They took the option the player base has preferred, which is to put too many people on too few servers rather than too few people on too many servers.
---
I've been using my mount more than FPs lately... xD
---
Of course youll keep using it. Do you need an addon to detect sarcasm, too?
---
No changes means no changes. 10k player megasevers are a change, it's perfectly fair to say that quadrupaling the server population would fundamentally alter the playing experience
---
Ok boomer.
---
Former Skeram here, saw this issue happening a while ago, bounced during 1st wave of xfers to Heartseeker. HS is simply beyond amazing for pvp
---
They're getting us prepped for Shadowlands
---
Exactly. It'll happen here aswell :p
---
Even on Grobbulus, the most balanced realm on US, it ain't exactly fun leveling up having to deal with the gank squads when you're 6 levels lower than them.
---
Sir, I don't know if you've seen the rest of this subreddit, but it is physically impossible for Horde to be camped right now.
---
Either you are lying or you are are lying.
---
yes, waiting 2 weeks and only releasing skeram and stalagg was such a cop out.  There should have been every PVP and most of the PVE servers stood up the Tuesday morning after name reservations went out.  Instead, they just go wait a couple weeks and let's see and that ruined classic for a lot of players on mega servers and servers with huge population imbalances because of the unlocked transfers early on.
---
I know thats why I am asking if CB / prep (no hemo) is still good when using daggers?
---
Just use a Freezing trap mate.
---
He's saying we are playing vanilla as it was, essentially from 1.10 on.  If you rolled on a server that started in 1.09 or 1.10 then this is basically the same experience but with gated content and way way more people.  
---
They weren't trying to remake wow as it was in 2004, is the point.
---
I remember one guy in my guild losing DKP bid because he apparently had someone else from the guild against him.
---
Can you make me some water?
---
There is none. Shit meme.
---
Some animals has knockbacks etc. Just makes it lots easier
---
Yea, only reason you're losing is because every else is cheating
---
bro please i beg you find original vanilla pvp gameplay with someone using this addon
---
And because of SPY, and time I find an alliance, it feels as though horde spawn out of thin air, and any 1v1 turns into a 5v1.
---
How dare you destroy a funny joke with a truth bomb like that
---
Why are you linking parses that even include trashmobs, and then act like it proves anything? Do you have any real data supporting that Shadow Priests do less than 50% of the other classes DPS in actual boss fights?
---
The joke
---
Your head.
---
Think of it this way; You can stay together in your current guild, or you can all join another guild that raids and be a stand-in. You'll get the benefits of being in a guild for grouping 5 man's with added bonus of filling raid spots if they're short. Win-win.
---
Ya i mean I’m rounding. It was sub 1420-50 by it was really high and I thought it was a little absurd. To be fair he crit me with both spells. Super lucky for him but that seems busted. Spell coefficients seem ungodly.
---
wat
---
I'll probably go the latter route, I'm on a PVP server. I am excited to level through the plaguelands though, I'll still try to quest even with the PVP. I'll supplement that with BRD/LBRS runs with my guild. They want to do attunement runs as well so I think this will be most of my experience from 55-60 in phase 2.
---
Doesnt Skeram still have a *shitload* more players, though?  The balances may be somewhat equal (just opposite factions), but if Skeram has 3x the players thats not going to create two servers that are anywhere near close.  Horde will just dominate both.
---
Herod and Heartseeker are both pvp servers. Explain to me how you would have predicted Herod would be Horde dominated and Heartseeker would be Alliance dominated?
---
I mean, the Zeppelin usually takes more than 30 seconds to arrive at the tower. As soon as the buff wears off, you're dead. I sometimes manage to jump off into the lake in Tirisfal but sometimes the Allies will follow me.
---
The bosses in strat and scholo are 62-63. What DPS would a 58 do? I’m sorry but no. Keep running BRD till 60.
---
thank you for your extremely constructive comment! I'll try "Getting Gud"
---
How is this obnoxious? You know there are other places in the world besides Hillsbrad and BRM...
---
I mean no one has sth against occasional PvP but some of us don't have the time to do corpse running for 2h out of yiru 2 1/2 hour game time. But for all who have the time this must be great
---
I'm currently running DW Fury myself in pvp and it's working out just fine for me. I don't use two 1-handed weapons mind you, even though I have good ones (Deathbringer in MH &amp; Perdition's Blade in OH). Instead, I use Obsidian Edged Blade, which I took over Ret Paladins in my raid because Ret sucks and they don't deserve anything. Granted I had a dedicated healer, but I went hardcore pvping the first day and was 2-3 shotting most clothes and 4 shotting most everything else. I also have basically all plate BIS gear for raiding at the moment and prefer to use that over my tier set because I enjoy the bigger hits vs. the extra health.
---
I, personally, just enjoying grouping with different people. I might not need a single drop in the instance, but I’ll go just for the experience with guildies or even randos who could later become friends.
---
no you're not entitled to a grief free experience unless you're on a pve server
---
That or stack ALL THE POTIONS.

Honestly I've never met a typical nerd WoW player. The bottom left image is so stereotypical and surely there will be people like this but everyone I've met is fucking normal and normal looking. Honestly couldn't tell a WoW player from a non WoW player on the streets.
---
Kinda wonder where this image came from. I've been gaming for some 20 years, 17 years online and not once have I met with someone I gamed a lot and found out they are a fat basement dwelling turbo nerd full of dimples. And I've met with quite of few of my regular online buddies. Honestly got problems understanding where this image of the typical PC gamer came from.
---
You can't get help with that quest or you fail, and even if you got friends to keep the opposite faction away, I'm pretty sure for that quest all they gotta do is hit the demon once to make you fail the quest.
---
"Griefing is the act of chronically causing consternation to other members of an online community, or more specifically, intentionally disrupting the immersion of another player in their gameplay."
---
I am calling griefing griefing. again, not all pvp is griefing, but griefing is griefing
---
God victim complex much? Since Thursday Alliance on my server have routinely grouped into raids and plowed through solo Horde players. Just as I’m sure some Horde groups on my server have although I haven’t seen. Just running around trying to do solo stuff since Thursday, I’ve probably spent 4-5 hours being griefed/camped by Alliance raid groups. It actually seems like the Alliance are trying to compensate for less population by grouping up into raids more and griefing Horde as much as possible on my server. Any Horde raids I’ve seen have only sprung up in retaliation of Alliance steamrolling zones.
---
Except you are barely getting any honor points. Outside of people running back to the flight master(for some reason), you won’t get HKs from people recently landed. On top of that since you just killed them as they landed they’ll give less honor the next time you kill them. If people are doing this to farm honor, then they aren’t doing the most efficient way at all.
---
Haha wow this image/joke actually reminded me of my first experience dying in WoW.
---
I remember dying being so confused why everything’s black and white. It took me 10min running around realizing what needed to be done. The world was so new back then
---
Only if you engaged in PVP. If you didnt engage its an immediate removal
---
We try!  Thanks for noticing!
---
hold back the tears mate u can do it
---
Seriously bro 
---
People  act like this game isn’t auto pilot capable
---
Spellpower hunter is amazing in situation where you can't or don't want to stay still long enough to aimed shot (read:PvP). Serpent Sting has 100% scaling and Arcane shot has 42% with a decently high crit chance. Additionally, you can dual wield spellblades, which no caster class can match.
---
Yeah you suck then you failed the hunter test.
---
Go buy a boost from a real hunter like the rest of the scrubs
---
I think back in the first patches you actually started with the combat log open on the right side, then people started moving it behind the chat window later on and this became the norm then. Not 100% sure but I also recall having it always open for the longest time.
---
We are getting cross server bgs, queues won't be that long.
---
It would be fun if blizzard could fix the fucking servers.  For now it's a laggy mess
---
Allright, thanks! I will check it out.
---
Every horde that's in a BG and not out on the streets is a horde that won't be able to kill us 36v2.
---
A cool trick is to get a running start and Rez like a drive by 
---
Helps if you’re a mobile class of course
---
Having migrations is great, but they should have kept limits on how big the diff should be allowed to be even on char creation and def when they people migrate to diff realms. Im not saying it can be perfect 50-50, but blizz have all the data they needed in order to avoid letting it become this mess that it is now.
---
I used to hate the escort quests where the NPC would spot something off the path and run to collect it, causing you to get into extra fights. Then when I started on Classic and had a friend help me with some quests... I realized I was doing exactly the same thing.
---
Well, it seems you don't know the defintion either
---
indeed.
---
it would be a good idea, but it's not in classic. if you want the improvement made to the game... it's in retail.
---
This is the most negative fucking gaming sub lmao

Take a look at the rewards and pick the side that give you the best reward for your class/spec. Other than that, I don't think picking a side makes any other difference.
---
There is a post regarding this quest further down. You might find some answers there. I have a friend new to wow, who did the quest within 2 days without any major help (just a warlock for one demon, dunno which one). So this quest is absolutely possible to do, but challenging.
---
He really just need more warlock friends

But all that tier! In our month and a half of raiding, we've had a maximum of 2 druids

Well all the most interesting stuff is already on youtube I don't really see a point of reposting them, I tought secondary/smaller changes thata ren't worth a video would be more interesting
---
This is like saying Ford shouldn't put it air bags because people crash their vehicles. Of *course* Blizzard should try to make the game as fun for everyone as possible.
---
Psychology isn’t art
---
Speak for yourself, i migrated from a horrible balanced realm to a great one, that later became greatly unbalanced as well due to open migration with 0 effort by blizz to disable migration for certain factions to certain realms in time...
---
Xbow from BWL and xbox from Naxx are both better
---
It also sounds like the quest is getting in your head.  May i suggest a little time away from it to give you a mental reset
---
If there's one thing we've learned in Retail from all the elves over the years, is you only become an elf by getting addicted to magical juices of some sort.
---
Literally never knew this
---
The lowest pop EU servers have a higher population than any Server did in original Classic.
---
I hate wpvp. Nothing is enjoyable about getting one shot and having zero counterplay and then having to run back to my corpse for 5 minutes just to get one shot again.
---
you must learn to die before you learn to live.
---
I’ve read you can get buffs beforehand, but no additional help from others. Although I think you can group with other hunters, let them kill the demons, and then loot the heads.
---
Yeah, everyone here having the worst time, meanwhile us on pve servers can have our cake and eat it too... when we choose to :)
---
What an amazing apologism for microtransactions in general. However, I think it's a bit naive to believe Blizzard got into gold selling to protect their customers and not their bottom line. I guarantee you Blizz's biggest issue with gold buyers was that people weren't buying it from them.
---
Honestly the Centaur quests take too much time and the rewards aren't worth it.  I've skipped it on all my chars.
---
People whining because they don’t have the tolerance to deal with PvP consequences in a PvP server as if people are supposed to give them a pass even though they’re an opponent. Classic is about dealing with a dangerous world against dangerous threats, including other players. Yes you’re going to get camped, rival your allies and come together against them. You may not always win but whining and hoping Blizzard will magically make your situation better is the reason retail is dumbed down as it is today. People saying they can’t level meanwhile running dungeons is a completely viable option, you may die on the way but if you persevere and get inside the enemy can’t follow you inside the instance and stop you from leveling. I’ve been camped many many times, but having this aspect of the game where I have to not only look out for mobs but for real live players as well is a thrill you can’t get in retail. There’s a reason there’s a PvE and a PvP server, I think some might have mixed up their choice.
---
I bet it's fun if you're 60.
---
If you look at the data set, alliance dominated servers tend to be PVE.
---
This is what I dealt with all weekend... multiple alliance roaming and going all in on a solo 58 while he was fighting mobs. It was some great pvp for sure! I really wouldn't mind if I was 60 and didn't need to level but man that shit got old quick, especially since most of them had raid gear.
---
This is good, if the problem reaches critical mass Blizzard will be forced to act or they will lose profit, which is what they care about.
---
Set it to follow the player but not stray too far from a defined path - problem solved. A couple escort quests in Classic work that way so the code is already there.
---
Silithus elementals are farmed constantly at 60 on my server Bighlesworth. If I'm lucky I can tag a few but there's always groups of people there starting pvp. The quests for Sillithis aren't even available till phase 5.
---
Kirtonos is dope if you enjoy being the underdog. There are plenty of intelligent, committed guilds. Intimate, is one of them.
---
Best of luck with your demon slaying. Especially in P2!
---
That would be pally bubble, you can't do shit while ice blocked.
---
So what did he bind strafe right to?
---
Argent Dawn rep, best used revered &gt; exalted as you get less rep gain from mobs/bosses then
---
Make sure you learn [Prayer of Fortitude](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17413/codex-prayer-of-fortitude) so you can buff the entire party at once. There's an equivalent for Divine Spirit.
---
I'm not going to quit and never said I was and not even complaining. Just discussing the issue and the sentiment that's come from it. If you don't think it's been shit for ally since honor release then you aren't paying attention. Go make the run to any high level dungeon entrance at anytime and you'll see what I'm talking about.

 Horde &lt;B Y O B&gt; | Horde Herod PVP | Hardcore Casuals /Serious Raiding    
---
ABOUT US   
---
We're a hard-casual PVP Horde guild looking for people who have busy lives outside of WoW. Our guild leadership ran guilds during Vanilla-Cata and have experience with MC, ZG, BWL, etc.  Now we'd like to kick back and enjoy Classic with fellow chill adults who have a job, family, and life outside of WoW--but who still understand what it takes to prepare for raid night.  This guild was made for YOU.    
---
BYOB's priority will be raiding but we also plan to make an impact on PvP with guild pre-mades.    
---
RAIDS   
---
Now that most of our members have reached 60 we're beginning our scheduled raids with Ony  and MC.  Our first MC run went well with 8/10 cleared and Onyxia down.    
---
RECRUITING PRIORITIES 
---
High: Priest, Mage, DWFury Warrior, R.Shaman &amp; R.Druid   
---
Medium: Warlock, Hunter   
---
Low: Tanks, Enh Shaman, Rogues     
---
RAID SCHEDULE   
---
Main raid: Fridays and Saturdays, 3 hour(10:00pm\*-1am) raid nights on weekends. \*10:00pm is the latest we want to pull, if we can organize and get in by 9:30 we will.  
---
   
---
LOOT   
---
A combination roll and Loot Council. Things are going to be as fair as possible. Example...weapons, rings, trinkets on loot council, members will know where these items go before we even step inside the raid. MT/OT will have priority, but other than that all set pieces free roll.    
---
EXPECTATIONS   
---
Be punctual (on time).   
---
Be excellent to each other.   
---
Play your class to the best of your ability

No problem good luck! Quick tip - make sure to hamstring mobs as they get low to prevent runners, especially in the Cath a runner can pull several packs and it gets messy fast.
---
I'll take the loss of a few silver just to get the shit out of my bags, it beats walking all the way over to a vendor.  Even if it only took 30 seconds to sell it at a vendor, that's a loss of about 60 silver in my time - since I can farm 70g an hour.  With an addon, it barely takes a second to list it - just as quick as destroying it.
---
You’re absolutely right.  If you want to continue to wpvp after phase 2 you’re in the right place.  I don’t really care for it because the vast majority is not consensual and essentially ganking.  When battlegrounds come out I’m perfectly happy just PvPing in them.  It sounds like we’re both in the right place, but this phase happens to be more fun for me.
---
Oh I didn’t know BWL and Naxx were out already
---
I've done like 50 or 100 dungeons. A blue BoE drops and in every dungeon, everyone has rolled greed, or occasionally need and equipped it.
---
Then a purple boe drops that someone in the group could equip and was an upgrade for them, and half the group say oh it's a boe so everyone roll need.
---
People go crazy when they see epics and get a purple mist in front of their eyes. They then justify to themselves that they should ninja it from the person for whom it's an upgrade, by saying oh it's normal. 
---
Well it's not normal, it's transparent self-interested justification, probably promoted by some streamers.

Us alliance rogues are trash at fighting warlocks without trinket. Have to one shot them or vanish their death coil. Good thing that the CC trinkets coming out next week
---
&gt; But instead its present from the start
---
That was the case for the majority of players, since more people were playing in 2006 than in 2005.  That was the original vanilla experience to them.  Also, they said they were not going to change stats on your gear because it makes it confusing for players and guides stating they have to go after gear that currently has bad stats and hold onto it until the gear gets updated at a later point.
---
These are all just self contained incidents. Nobody has that mentality IRL. 
---
If you equip it, need on it. 
---
If it’s for an off spec, ask your group first (else greed if no replies) 
---
Rest, just greed or pass.

In multiple other threads it has been discussed, it was said that the buff reporting in the actual classic client did not advise of previously cast buffs, only new buffs cast, so same add on functionality as before, client is the difference.

All Queues are imaginary. Why not make one that actually helpes when we have queues anyway?

We are talking about the last 2 months, not now.

My server is 50/50 and the world is more fun than anything I've ever experienced in WoW. Glad we both picked server types we actually enjoy! RIP to the people who picked PvP servers who don't enjoy world PvP (????????????)
---
And RIP to the people who got fucked by faction balance. That wasn't your fault and there was nothing you could do about it, unlucky RNG and I truly feel bad for you guys
---
You came up with a rule you made up and then used it to justify your opinion.
---
It's fascinating, the leash range mean that it's literally impossible to ever end up in a situation where you might die unless you simply go afk at your keyboard, and sometimes that's not even enough to get you killed (looking at you mop second wind).
---
They ignored you because they were being nice, not because you were a DK.
---
This, and not standing in fire. As a healer I know exactly which dps I want in every raid because I'm not constantly burning mana to top them off after taking avoidable damage. Know the boss mechanics, avoid as much damage as possible, do solid dps, and you'll always have a spot in my book!

---
Obviously that is pre-census break, but the pops have have only deviated slightly. The Horde&gt;Alliance mentality is hugely overblown on this subreddit. I play on Arugal - it's tough sometimes but it creates unique experiences that no other modern MMO can.
---
Its robe of the insight :D
---
Lol @ all these people telling others to reroll like it's so trivial to do. Laziest suggestion ever.
---
I don't take commands from randos on the Internet. Now get lost.

Small exception being shapeshifted druids. They're counted as beasts.

Kicking a guy that's working on overcoming an addiction. You're an absolute dickbag of a human.

And to the dude with the addiction, I lost my brother to iv opiate addiction. If you ever need someone to talk to, just shoot me a pm.
---
The last 10 levels feel annoying even without pvp. With pvp it's exhausting.
---
*scuttles away with 600 daily honour*
---
The only data point that I have is auction house auctions. Heartseeker on Alliance has twice as many auctions as Alliance on Skeram. 
---
So theoretically twice as many Alliance on Heartseeker than on Skeram. So let's say Alliance has 2000 on Skeram and 4000 on Heartseeker. Meaning 8000 and 1000 Horde, respectively. If you took 3000/1000 Horde/Alliance from Skeram and threw them onto Heartseeker the numbers start to look a lot better for both servers.

You made me think of Jaraxxus and then i imagined the owl that ran away as Jaraxxus.

---
Please, point me to another regional community. I have chosen to go with regional, because I was playing alone before every time - and it's not nearly as good. Yes, there are stronger guilds, but if it's as "professional", ut becomes very boring once you have nothing else to clear if there isn't a sense of companionship.
---
I had the chance to meet these people face to face and that is something entirely different than just raiding together a few times a week.
---
If you’re in level 60 dungeons, ignorance isn’t innocence.  At that point you’ve sunk in probably 2 weeks of real time (more than two months of a full time job) and taking someone’s best item because you didn’t know isn’t acceptable.
---
Skels from behind is normal.  At one part in the cathedral you will also get 2 elites running up (they will emote and yell) from around a corner in front of you, after you clear a specific pack in a hallway.

Just try it late at night.
---
Unless you’re schedule doesn’t allow for it, in that case less QQ and more pew pew you’ll get it eventually.
---
Try to get your plaguelands stuff done in non-primetime on your server. I woke up early on the weekend and did plaguelands without issue... but at primetime I couldnt go 5 minutes without a gank.
---
I thought you couldn't make an opposite faction char on the same realm? Or is a whisper x-realm on classic?
---
It deffinitely is... The alliance corpse camping me and patrolling where they see the demon is really pissing me off, and it's making it hard for me to pay attention to the fight with alliance all over my ass
---
&gt; 4 jobs 3 wives and 10 kids
---
That sounds like quite the nightmare!
---
The problem with this phase is the levelers are completely screwed.
---
It was obvious once it started anyone above level 48 would be unable to play until the BGs open
---
Are you marksmanship
---
People raid because of raid logging? I don't understand.
---
Uhh, should we tell him?
---
Unless he meets the trex
---
Yes, jackass, that’s exactly what I’m saying! I’m a MONSTER WHO HATES FRIENDSHIP!
---
Fucking idiot.
---
thanks for posting this!
---
? Lol it's literally subjective. Some people enjoy leveling more than any other content in the game.
---
I did mention in the video there are multiple ways to do it and the way I showed wasn't the only way to do it.  Keep in mind I can't record multiple versions since I can only do it once :)
---
Ya try to bring a hunter as they are punished a lot less by higher leveled mobs and you should be fine. A full group of 48s might struggle.
---
Absolutely!
---
Probably mains horde.
---
That's why they should follow the player, and the player should be following waypoints that the NPC highlights.
---
Uhh no it wont.   Then all the zerg idiots split off into even more gank squads thus making the game even worse.  WTF are you talking about?
---
A second raid group works out well when there's a third raid group you can fuck over &gt;.&gt;
---
No, but now I do. I don't get it.
---
Hehe cool to hear that! I actually borrowed the quote from Darkest Dungeon but your addition made it truly priceless thank friend!
---
Not everything has te be fun. But if you have to do 20 coprseruns just to get into an instance its getting ridiculous
---
Half the time it's camping graveyards and flight points, too. Honor?
---
It works like that in retail now...  Are you forgetting this game came out 15 years ago?
---
Hahahahahahahaha as a GM myself I had my own list of very choice words :p
---
Blizzard really dropped the ball on skeram
---
The alliance population will decline even more with this wpvp phase
---
*The Monkey's Paw curls and crumbles away*
---
Now escort NPCs move even slower than walking speed!
---
There is no content to be released for classic after Naxx though, so that's an endgame.
---
I can definitely do it without CoR, the point is it's the easiest and fastest way to do it.
---
That's a big reach, on an assumption.  (I play for the horde)
---
I think we should remove the ability for players to attack other factions on the pvp relms. Atleast till I hit 60!
---
Been there! Oh, the invisibility mistery... We don't know if you're gone or if you're gonna surprise attack us any minute.
---
Wake up 5am to scout for Black Lotus, someone is taking the game too seriously :)
---
You're suggesting that Blizzard intentionally make battleground matchmaking worse for players in order to try to motivate players to change their play habits. That's just a bad design choice. 
---
Also, blizzard being open about population balance is never going to happen. 
---
Lastly, "farming honor on an imbalanced server", correct me if i'm wrong but from my understanding honor is based on your percentile performance within your faction on your realm. In other words it's no easier for the majority faction to farm honor than the minority, because they're competing with more players.
---
I don't know what percentage of old school WoW players go to Blizzcon.... I played Beta-Cata and returned for classic.. none of the 20 or so people I know that returned for this goes to Blizzcon. I imagine most of the Blizzconners are the people who are still playing retail.
---
Buffs. It tracks buffs being loaded onto players as they are rendered onto your screen.
---
The mere fact that you are broken brained enough to equate some dude in my guild to Arnold Schwarzenegger is absolutely astounding mental gymnastics.
---
"In PvP servers, you're automatically flagged for PvP anytime you enter contested or enemy territory, where you'll spend most of your time after early levels. Pick these servers if you want to fight other players often **or like the omnipresent threat of PvP combat.**"
---
Unfortunately, census mods are no longer accurate due to how they have to work. Grobbulus, my new server, is far more balanced than that website says.
---
I agree. I think this aspect is one of many reasons that I originally got into WoW. 
---
I think the negative voices are always the loudest. I appreciate seeing posts like this. 
---
This is the game. This is what phase 2 is. If you don’t like it, play something else. The world doesn’t have to twist to your personal wants and desires
---
It's IEDs, shits bad right now.
---
how in the world do you think it is "unethical" do you even know what that word means?  Your morals have nothing to do with this topic,  either use it or dont, if you dont use it, you always have the option to read your combat log and have access to all the information that the spy addon provides to you.
---
I also doubt that it's the majority of gamers that look like that in this day and age, but there was a time where computers in homes were rarer than today. Having one (to game on nonetheless) likely was an active choice. 
---
Regarding the people you met: It is possible that the people resembling the guy in the picture were the people that did not want to meet up.
---
Try some niche isolated areas to grind in-between dungeons.  Pretty sure swamp of sorrows is generally empty of alliance and has mobs maybe green to you?
---
Oh sweet, I do have gear to swap around the stats like that. Thanks man
---
As a guy posted in a separate comment, it's on he wow website, and is also under the "specifications" of a pvp server. Took an all of 2 seconds to figure out.
---
And fwiw he asked to also change how it works so he "doesn't waste time killing useless targets" anymore.
---
Yupppp my guilds member count is like 200 and we are normally a few short of 40 and occasionally have to try and pug a healer or something.
---
I play on Whitemane, so I have only my own experiences to go by here, but it's absolutely insane how many horde there are for each alliance. It's easily 50:1 at Scarlet Monestary in particular. I know that's not the server ratio, but the actual ratio of people in that area.
---
And it requires context if you want it to be more than just your own opinion. Are you playing on horde or alliance? How is the faction balance? Are you max level solo mage, or is this during the leveling progress. 
---
I had tons of fun during the leveling, in particular STV was a fun zone with the common quest hubs. But lately there's no point in moving out in common areas like winterspring or ungoro because of numerous kill squads moving around neutering all progress you're trying to make. A lot of classes has no way to outplay a regular 5 man, not to mention the raids.
---
I think you missunderstood: I'm talking about druids in form getting manaburned while in vanilla they were immune to those effects.
---
Did Dire Maul yesterday and shifted out of bear form to innervate the healer in a clutch situation, only to see that my mana got reckt by the elementals while in bear form. Nedlessly to say we wiped because I couldn't innervate nor go back into bear.
---
Agree but also disagree. I definitely see classic as a way to bring people back into the universe, but I think the overwhelming majority of people who are still playing classic today are enjoying the hell out of it. I know I am.
---
It’s more interesting to post negative news than good news (it’s the age old “if it bleeds it leads” methodology). The people who are enjoying the game aren’t posting about it because they’re too busy playing it. The people who aren’t enjoying it or just want a moment in the sun go and post negatively about it.
---
At the end of the day though blizzard wins. People who sub to classic and people who sub to retail are paying the same price, but they only care that you’re subbed, not which content you’re playing. What I don’t think they anticipate though is how many people are going to purchase shadowlands in the classic community. I for one am not because I don’t have time for both, and I flat out don’t like the direction the story has taken.
---
Most quests involve killing mobs. So you still kill mobs and also get a large exp boost every once in a while.
---
Questing is definitely faster then plain grinding in general. But there are definitely some spots where there aren't good quests or the travel time isn't worth it and you should grind for a bit.
---
Full cleared LBRS in 50 minutes yesterday with a 57 Hunter.  Couldnt agree more, I've never had an issue with anyone who isnt 60. Most time they're more patient and less likely to be an elitist jackass.
---
Imagine realizing nobody cares and believing Blizzard is going to do anything about it.
---
Good gaming experience is also being able to play. At this moment some zones are simply unplayable for lower levels
---
The issue with the corpse run is that not only does pvp killing be annoying, it places a massive inconvenience on the player. I feel genuinely not pleased to attack non-60s because I don't want to make them run 5 minutes dead back to what they were doing. But I have to because my goal is to pvp so I need the gear from ranks. Sometimes if I don't do it myself, they will because they also want the ranks.
---
It only feels good when I get revenge. But I'm sure I've made myself already on a few KoS lists...
---
Tbf if Spy is basically cheating and those things are worse, they should probably be looked at?
---
I completely get that, Just 60 stuff is more fun imo I guess?
---
And might I add, in between the discord (push to talk) commands that you hear in between raid pulls, the furious screams of "YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE COMPU-", the sobs and cries "daddy daddy you never play with-"
---
Sometimes hearing those things makes me feel a little guilty, abetting and playing a game that's destroying people's lives. But then I slightly comforted with the thought that well, that's someone else's life, not mine.
---
hey hey don't start asking me questions about my life. no no no.
---
This quote been repeated for the last decade.
---
I’ve been trying to figure out how popular Warcraft logs is. I hadn’t heard of it until i started raiding in classic. Last I checked the site has 300k players logged.
---
I don’t understand the “everyone need expensive BoE’s” especially if it’s an upgrade for me. So everyone else who will just pawn it off gets a shot at the gear that I will then have to buy back off of them at the AH? Seems fucky to me but I see that position regularly defended
---
The priest t1 robe is so much worse than TF tho it’s not even funny, something like -50 healing power in exchange for some int
---
Queues won’t be longer than a few minutes since they are cross-server
---
Right, I'm explaining that the majority of the time, you will see people complaining about Horde.... because Horde tends to have a faction advantage in pvp servers.
---
I'm not sure what's hard to understand here.
---
Dwarf = Best Race
---
&gt; Regarding the people you met: It is possible that the people resembling the guy in the picture were the people that did not want to meet up.
---
I mean I thought so much but I still find it weird that this is supposed to be "the standard gamer". If this was ever the case, we're long past this.
---
At first I thought “grey head” was a euphemism for still really pissed off.
---
i tried,to install it twice, when you do, It saves the tears of people who post on reddit in a nice little jar
---
Try doing the quest at a non-peak time. Like 5am in the morning. P2 sucks hard....
---
Get Deminslayijg enchant on your weapon, helps a lot. And get Major Rejuvenation Potion if you're struggling with the Silithus demon.
---
The queue will go down again shortly
---
&gt;slippery slopes and ad hominem
---
Makes it that much easier to block you.
---
k well that's your only option besides crying on reddit. Definitely wasn't a "command" lmfao
---
Arcanite reaper is only 60/40 ally favored your server is virtually balanced compared to those where the complaints are coming from
---
You are a loser
---
&gt;I remember the Tarren Mill death-fest that was when all this came out last go-round as well. 
---
So do I, that was fun, what isn't fun is being ally on a horde dominated server and getting ganked where ever you go, you can't get on a boat or gryphon without getting killed, good luck going to darkshore outside of a group, the run back from the GY there is longer than the boat stays.
---
I'm one of the people that has given up, it's simply not fun anymore.  I have a 6 month sub, I'll keep raiding, and doing the occasional dungeon, but I've shelved my alts for now, and I have no idea if I'll keep playing or not.
---
Bat stats = +6/0/0
---
Owl stats = +7/0/0
---
Plus owls can learn claw when bats can't (they learn bite , and claw&gt;bite )
---
An owl will always be better. Maybe not worth the Darna run though.
---
It's all situational. Weather a player is enjoying phase 2 largely comes down to how you answer these 2 questions.
---
1. How populated is your server and what is the faction balance breakdown?
---
2. Do you play on the majority faction or the minority faction?
---
If you answered that your server has more than a slight amount of faction imbalance and you play the majority faction then you are likely enjoying phase 2. If you answered the opposite you are probably not liking phase 2.
---
should give you 99% hit chance since its only 7 levels.
---
Clearly you have no idea what game breaking means end you’re absolutely frightened of losing your little cheat addon.
---
I don't believe this is implemented yet, but it sure would solve my problems if it gets implemented.
---
Maybe you just have more time on your hands.
---
&gt; The storm will blow over soon. 
---
 **Soon™**
---
Yep that's it. If somebody or your pet attacks the demon after you've pulled it, it despawns and you get to wait for 30mn until his respawn
---
As a new player, it took me 13 days and 5 hours on my Warrior. I was playing hard by the end trying to keep up with my hunter friend, I think he's the only reason I hit 60 as fast as I did.
---
Which should be more than enough to draw a fair conclusion. On EU, alliance only make up less than 40% of players clearing end game content, and horde being the premiere PvP faction, participation in PvP has ALWAYS been higher on the horde side. In retail, even though the faction balance server wide is close to 50-50, 67,7% of players rated over 1800 in arena are horde. It wouldn't be odd if the participation numbers for BGs are around 75-25, which would make horde queue at least 20-30 minutes.
---
No item context or player builds mentioned.  Hard to say that.
---
Most confusion id see is with offspec or BOE items.
---
The funny thing is, when BG's open up world PvP will drop severely.  It's much easier to grind honor to rank up in BG's than in world PvP.  Just relax for a month or so until they bring out Warsong and AV early like they did Dire Maul.
---
you kill them when they land so they respawn with half hp
---
Seems like you might be a little jealous of the amazing skills Locks have. However it also sounds like you're running with some shitty Locks. Personally I learned to space my dots and not ruin everyone's day by pulling aggro from the tank. Also never expect healing after I life tap, I'm usually fine after I hit my target with some life drain or syphon life.
---
could be.
---
rogues can farm other ways faster and in liquid ways, even brd is faster than devilsaurs at this point, devilsaurs aren't liquid and take time to sell, if you got 50000 devilsaur leather it doesn't matter because no one is gonna buy them all
---
Ok, interesting...if Hunters don't get burned, then i agree it's a bug.
---
Because its already happened before? before p2 you could log right on.   
---
Its just a quick surge of players, give it 1 week queues will be almost gone. In 2 weeks you'll be able to log on anytime.   
---
Also depends on where you live, 5pm Server time it starts to build up fast. 8pm Server time the west coast starts to log on. When the East and west coast clash on loggin times you see the queue. 6-9pm are times to avoid
---
Wouldn’t he need 17-23 drops if he killed 100 mobs to equal the drop rate?

Is the mantle of chromatic resistance currently available from the argent dawn?
---
Mageblade is BiS for HPally as well
---
do the people you play with run any addons? do raid leaders call out timers etc?  do you raid without threat meter?
---
I know some people do in fact play "clean" but you dont play alone and if other memebers you are running with are using addons that read the combat log and pass that info in you, it's like you are guilty by association,
---
How is going to an auction house quicker than a vendor?
---
Yeah it's a mess everywhere.
---
You're all fucking children. You joined a PVP server then complain when there is PVP. Sounds like a bunch of carebears to me.
---
Point missed. Because you cant read.
---
Rant incoming.
---
I think there's overall some confusion and gray-area terminology on what "BiS" means and how it's used.
---
"BiS" is an acronym for "Best in Slot". It means that the particular item *is the most powerful item available to you*, for that class/slot, at that gearing point in time.
---
Therefore there is no such thing as a "oh that's my 5th place BiS". **No it isn't**. If a player were to say that, they are mis-using the terminology altogether.
---
Eg. "The Warden Staff is BiS for Bear druids for the WoW Classic". &lt;- correct and proper usage, and yes, it is.
---
Eg. "High Warlord's War Staff is 6th place BiS"...THEN IT'S NOT BEST IN SLOT. It doesn't even come anywhere close.
---
--
---
Whew, with that out of the way - I do fully agree that upfront communication seems to be the solution really to solve all problems. A useful macro to click at the start of the dungeon perhaps:
---
/p Greetings group! Loot rules are: Need if you Need, Greed if you don't. So if the green is an upgrade, Need it.
---
&gt;PvP on a PvP server
---
&gt;unethical
---
Its not about choice. Its about knowledge. I dont think half the player base is choosing to not use spy. I think they are unaware it exists or to what extent it breaks the vanilla-like experience. 
---
Ive said it before, but there is a really simple solution to all of this. Put Spy, AH bots, and cast bar readers as default in the client and be done with it. No more unfair advantage, and your statement about choice will become true.
---
I've been saying it for weeks.
---
Population cap increase is directly responsible for most of the current issues in game.

This is my MF Guild Leader.

There used to be a guide on petopia on this, can’t find it atm :)

You need to learn new skills for pets. For this you need to tame new pets, learn skill and then teach your "level 10 cat from Darnassus".

They didn’t do it based on server type back in the day.

&gt;You should invite 58s and 59s into your dungeon groups

???
---
Yeah it was totally like this on my PvP server before.
---
Found the Hordelet.
---
Thanks you too.  Just trying to make the final push to 60, currently 57!
---
Im not on a pvp server, but I was having issues with Horde hitting the mob and making him despawn.
---
I camped my dude right in front of Blackrock on the road like you did and logged in this morning right before work (6am EST).  Klinfran was casually strolling by so I figured I fight him.
---
I got him down with 0 issues and didnt even see any other players (mind you Im on Mankrik which is high pop and 70/30 Horde).
---
Good luck bro.
---
Been forced to get rid of quite a few the fun items but some of the items i have left
---
[Skull of Impending Doom](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4984/skull-of-impending-doom), [Thermotastic Egg Timer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9644/thermotastic-egg-timer), [Torch of Retribution](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10515/torch-of-retribution), [Luffa](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19141/luffa), [Nifty Stopwatch](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2820/nifty-stopwatch), [Linken's Boomerang](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11905/linkens-boomerang), [Green Whelp Armor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7375/green-whelp-armor)(not a quest item but cool regardless)
---
You're a baby..go back to retail and roll on a pve server
---
play doing off hours? And there's nothing buggy about them you just suck
---
For people who don't raid high difficulties or do M+ I can't help but think that it's a glorified stamp collection/barbie game for them. Dress up your char to look nice and collect pets (or something like this).
---
But hey, I also don't get why anyone would play games on Facebook but here we are.
---
Yes, the massive servers and non-blizzlike server populations are a problem. Here I agree.
---
On sustained single target fights, our dps can be very high. It’s very difficult to get top dps in most MC fights though, either due to fight mechanics or because of raid composition.
---
Most raid leaders approach group composition in such a way that melee dps gets the biggest buff. Since mdps doesn’t need to worry about mana conservation, their overall damage output is unlimited as long as they’re kept alive. So we are expected to spec into AP buffs for the group, and often have to take lower dps pets for the same reason. Other party members are more likely to buff mdps as well. For example, A shaman in our group is more likely to drop windfury totem than grace of air, and is less likely to drop a mana tide totem to help with our regen. If we have optimal buffs, we do significantly more damage. However, mdps damage output would suffer greatly.
---
There are still ways you can ensure that you’re doing as much damage as possible. As you get more comfortable with the fight, you’ll learn to identify where to position yourself to minimize the amount of time you spend not firing shots. You’ll learn when to feign and drink during combat so you can continue to deal damage when casters run out of mana. Often, hunters are the last players alive at the end of a difficult fight, and that survivability can be the difference between a kill and a wipe. IMO, that’s way more important than who’s on top of the meters.
---
I snorted and it hurt. Thanks
---
AoEing a large group of players is one of the great things ever
---
if only we could make freinds eh
---
Please spread the message, particularly to Stalagg lol. Had a 60 horde rogue just follow me all throughout un'goro yesterday, even into the silithid hives. Like come on...you gotta get better honor/hour joining one of the bigger fights rather than following me around for 1 kill every 4 minutes (yes I timed corpse runs, also can we get another GY literally *anywhere* in UG?)
---
Up to date does not mean accurate sadly. The way addons like census plus work now is far too flawed for accuracy. Skeram, my old server says its 63 37. Even before the last free transfer (not the current faction locked) exodus of a few hundred minimum (3 major guilds and many smaller guilds/unguilded) it was worse than what the website says
---
The grey players would then also have to not even be able to attack the higher level players. Otherwise you could get low levels harassing high levels and the high level would have no way to do anything about it without getting a DHK
---
I've never seen any NPC go faster if you're ahead of them (not to be confused with the NPCs that are literally just pets, which follow you and match your speed). The yell the same line as if you're behind them, which is something like "Where'd you go, I need you to stay near me".
---
Great idea, stop punishing players just because they didnt start at launch!
---
General tips to raiding:
---
Bring lots of consumables.  Mana pots, mp5 or stam food, dark runes, whatever ya got.
---
Bring 10x the reagents you think you need
---
Be aware of the map, never stand in fire.  As a healer keep an eye out for people either in fire or about to be in fire so you can preheal and save em.
---
Every boss has a couple mechanics important for a couple classes/roles.  Your raid leader will hopefully go over them specifically for you.   As a priest, expect a LOT of dispel magic.  
---
As a healer you will often be assigned to the tanks or the raid, try to stick to that and trust your other healers to stick to it so you aren't sniping heals and wasting Mana. 
---
As a healer If you're on raid heal make sure you have an add-on that shows rejuv, renew on targets so that you aren't sniping those heals from others
---
As a healer if you're assigned to tanks expect them to get absolutely wrecked.  Try to be always casting and efficient heal, and try to cancel it at about 0.5sec remaining if they don't need the heal.   If you cancel and they needed it by accident, just queue up a big heal or start hitting your oh shit buttons.
---
As a healer make friends with any feral druids in your raid and woo them into giving you their innervate.
---
There’s no reason to do this.  Why would they?
---
The only legitimate split would be keeping RP separate for immersion.
---
It’s because alliance aren’t all assholes like horde
---
shut up
---
Someone has a bad case of Stockholm syndrome............
---
&gt; The funny thing is if you're leveling as horde, you don't have to worry too much, so those people will stay making the problem even worse.
---
Yeahh...not on all servers, like at all. If the server has a somewhat equal number you'll see just as many alliance running around ganking any +48 horde they can lay their lands on.
---
Yea, cant see how this would turn out horrible
---
In my mind, if its not in the client, its not really fair to use.
---
Doesn't matter.  
---
There's no quest rewards, just gold and exp.
---
That makes a lot of sense. My one issue is I really want to play the class I am currently. So I could make an alt and level  while I wait for this to die down, but then if I decide I want to stay on the pve server, now I'm not on my favorite class. The alternative is to re-level another character of the same class which is also not ideal.
---
Using skewed data for rough estimates is how you end up with wrong answers
---
 I am having trouble solo as a warrior vs similarly leveled mages/locks/shadow priests (50). My gear is fairly decent and I'm using Bonebiter Axe atm.
---
Against lock and shadow priest I seem to make all the right moves (charge in and pop berserker stance to be ready to get out of fear, interrupt them, MS etc.) but will lose if they are at full hp. They truly kill me with only instant cast dots/death coil which kind of sucks. Am I just engaging them wrong?
---
Mages I feel like I need to maybe start carrying around FA pots because the amount of slows they have is ridiculous. Even with escape artist, rocket boots, Gnomish Net-o-Matic Projector, grenades, charge and intercept they can still kite and kill you. And even if you FA pot.... double ice block... polymorph... I mean come on.
---
Anyway, any tips would be great. I am fully aware warriors shine most with a healer so maybe I just have to look forward to that.
---
It's funny you mentioned this because that's exactly what happened a few weeks ago. As a healer it was eye-brow raising but I didn't think much of it. But the melee dps flipped out.
---
It wouldn't.  They're full of shit, and just want to keep exploiting the addon.
---
Then low level players could grief 60s by suiciding into aoe.
---
Horrible idea.
---
how?
---
Very much like the shaman scholomance quest that tests your ability of using ankhs
---
I think all levels should give honor. Kill the enemy!!!   
---
PS. you can find me at any lowbie flight path killing everyone.
---
Click my name. Go ahead. Was it hard? Ok now type /target Thangrim. Did that feel about the same?
---
Pretty much this
---
Looking at you, Bajheera
---
Woah
---
I’m actually going to get this add-on for the pure reason that I’m a holy priest that can’t win 99% 1v1, let alone when one is strolling behind me while I’m at 50% health and 20% mana. If this will help tip me off 2 seconds sooner so I can maybe survive then so be it.
---
They gave warriors a heal at one point though. It was fucking awful in pvp.
---
Okay. Then flag the grey player as an honorable kill if they initiate combat.

Personally, it wasn't the conveniences of modern WoW for me. I love some of them. I hated how easy the game became. I missed the skill trees, the class quests and the comradery of the server not having a group finder and having to run places with my group. I would personally love a hybrid of the two versions.
---
But I do understand where you are coming from. Few people in my guild complain about things. Dude, its a 15 year old game.
---
Then every raid would bring along a couple 'fuck-you' lowbies just to screw with the other faction.
---
I think it would be a hilarious turn of the tables.
---
It's either questie or tomtom, get both you will be quite happy.
---
&gt; Ah, so you agree that gear doesn't matter in arena.
---
Visually? Elite gear has always been a show but the gladiator mounts always been the most important.
---
Well at least you are consistent. I don't think most players would agree with you though.
---
&gt;&gt;Secondly, this wouldn't stop people from bitching, only change what they are bitching about.
---
&gt;A round of fucking applause for this right here.
---
It's why I can't take complaining on this sub seriously anymore.
---
This sub: Blizzard, you fucked up with X! Fix it by doing y!
---
Blizzard: *does Y*
---
This sub: We didn't mean Y! We meant y! And you did it wrong! And too late!
---
Not sure if WoWpop is correct here. Does 647 alliance vs 4250 horde characters sound like the experience you're having? (Numbers of characters at level 60 from [here](http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/stalagg) ).
---
How about the legitimate reason of that you can't ban an addon like this because it's using information provided in the combat log. The only thing this would change would people would have a log open with the filter options set up in a way it would show names, just like people did in classic. I don't get how this is so hard to understand, it's giving you information that is actually available, just because you didn't know to use or didn't want to use that information just leaves you at a disadvantage to them, but doesn't cause grounds to remove the addon. Just play with the understanding that it's likely that people have these addons, and learn and adapt to that.
---
nope
---
Not to mention griefing by suiciding lower level characters into wPvP chaos aoe and getting DHKs for anyone in the entire raid of anyone who accidentally touches one of them with a tick kf blizzard or something...
---
I've had a good time.
---
But it can be better.
---
Many of Vanilla's placeholder mechanics need some adjustment
---
if they decide to do "changes", then it's not "wow classic" anymore.
---
I run Angerforge's sword MH and Thrash Blade OH and it's not a drop in DPS. Or at least, not a noticeable one. Mirah's might be better but it's probably very marginal.
---
The thing people forget is that slice and dice gains more benefit the slower a weapon is. So whatever theoretical dps is lost from not having a faster swing is gained both from the faster swinging heavy hitter plus the bonus sword procs it generates.
---
&gt;This breaks casting bar addons.
---
Still waiting to hear the downside... lol
---
Also if you die in Darnassus you can spirit rez at the Nelfs version of Goldshire and bypass all of the city and at lv 10ish the rez-sickness will be gone by the time you get to where the owls spawn which is north of the town before you enter darnassus from the east.
---
Yes please invite me. I've not run a Dungeon in over 10 levels because no one is lfm.
---
all have different ways to play! Honestly I solely only focused on leveling because I was trying to keep up with others in my guild. Also I am a hunter which I read is best for solo play (which I knew what I was gonna do and played "hunter" in the last mmo I played). Half the time I was just spamming dungeons nonstop and I only logged off in an inn for that rested xp. Last night was the first time I didn't log off in an inn. My ss was on CD and didn't want to run back to a flight path haha.
---
Yeah most wow players I know are just normal people. They don't adhere to anyone stereotype. I've seen athletic, fat, skinny average players from both sexes that come from a variety of backgrounds.
---
Moot point, roll elsewhere if you don't want to risk being outnumbered and unfairly camped
---
So here's why this kind of thing is a bad idea, it only positively affects you.
---
If you take off cross realm battleground there are two outcomes.  The first is that a bunch of people on the dominant faction transfer and the second is that absolutely jackshit happens.
---
If nothing happens no one benefits at all and many people have their experience made worse.
---
If the diaspora actually happens, a shitload of OTHER SERVERS start to get more overwhelmed.
---
The largest part of this problem is the amount of people playing horde on PvP servers.  There isn't a good way to "balance" a 60/40 population difference across the game.  Even if you make it less bad on some servers, you are just pushing the problem to other servers.  As with many of these suggestion, the solutions being presented aren't solutions to the problem but merely "Fuck everyone else" solutions.
---
Amen to everything you just said. I’m in the same situation and I can’t even begin to describe how ideal it is and how easy it was to accomplish.
---
I believe 30sp does also give healing in 1.12, but I would recommend 55 healing unless you plan on being shadow more than 50% of the time.
---
You know what? You're right, and I'm sorry for being a smug douchebag. I thought I had checked everything, but there are apparently 2 boxes in one of the sub-categories that are both un-checked,
---
lol shut up dumbfuck
---
The stick is people choosing a pvp server when they new the pvp patch would come before battlegrounds
---
Please don't procreate.
---
I’ve never understood the hate for reserving an item. Granted that rogue is going to have a tough time filling that group, but it literally costs you nothing and doesn’t hurt you at all to worry about yourself.
---
There's been plenty of changes.
---
Operating on the 1.12 system, using a modified Legion engine, how patches are phased-in, layering, etc.
---
I‘m not 100% sure it was like that in vanilla, but in bc you couldn‘t burn ferals, guess that‘s one of the overhauls that came with bc first
---
if there is any quest holder within 20 or 30 yards, then book it.  
---
if there isn't, then stop and yell at them.
---
Yeah I'm thinking due to not using a mouse I'd just get steamrolled in WPvP. BGs should suffice for when I actually want to do pvp. 
---
It actually isn't that difficult in PvE using a trackpad. Just have to set up keybindings correctly and change a few settings like how the camera operates. 
---
It's been working well so far. I'm sure I would be leveling faster overall with a mouse but I'm about to ding 55 with 8 days played, should hit 60 with a little over 9 days which isn't too slow.
---
Dude when your realm is completely unbalanced because you're a level 60 who kept corpse camping level 30s, you'll be on here crying harder than anyone else.
---
The current state of gameplay was not advertised, nor was it part of vanilla.   
---
If there's a side that's entitled, it's the side that wants to keep farming individual kills with no challenge from the safety of an entire raid group.
---
Blizzard warned folks about high pop realms.  
---
They **did nothing** to warn folks about how badly they would screw up initial faction balance, how their decisions to fix that screw up would compound the problem further, and how 1/3 of their players who were not 60 yet would go through living hell to hit max level because Phase 2 would be rushed. 
---
Honestly, Blizz is to blame here, and has yet to accept responsibility.  That's why players are fuming, and rightfully so.  I dont see people complaining much about queue times (which is what Blizz warned them about).  However, every 2nd post is spitting fire about faction balance and getting ganked at low levels (all things the community warned Blizz about weeks ago).
---
I wouldnt be surprised if Blizz sees a big drop in subs (at which point we can expect a reactive response vs a proactive one, and more paint to come).  Faction specific queues?  Imaging they just got it right the first time..................
---
Should’ve rolled a NE bro. Lmao but seriously you’re fine, I wouldn’t worry about your pace
---
Had Mr Smite dodge 4 sunders in a row last Friday.
---
This is a debuff you are afflicted with approximately 60% of the time when you make the choice of rolling a character on a pvp server unfortunately.
---
So ganking squads just bring couple of lowlvl alts with them as aoe sacrifice to punish everyone who dares to fight back?
---
When you fight for honour, you realise the points gotten is much better if you can instantly wipe loners out and move on to scout for the next prey. The primary incentive isn't fun or doing big pvp fights, otherwise there'd not be such a huge change in the transition to phase 2.
---
The my little pony actual audience guy belongs to the alliance 5 man groups camping flight points.
---
Alright, guess I'll keep trying to get logged in before I get home and if not I'll play my horde on Grobbulus in the meantime.
---
Oh I feel you, discrimination towards me for a number of different reasons, be it racial(thankfully that stopped towards the tail end of the 1980's), but the stigma from my video game hobby was definitely there and certainly didn't abate until I think maybe closer to the late 1990's or so?
---
The worst is when people bash others because of "shouldn't you be doing something more productive like sports" HAH, well actually I happen to very much dislike sports because of what even things like Ultimate Frisbee turn otherwise reasonable people into assholes. Pass me a controller anyday over that.
---
IMO the 5% spirit bonus makes them better in any situation—which is most—that doesn't require fear wards.  I played a NE main in vanilla so I made one in classic (though it's not my main, nor even highest alt ATM), but I've been considering switching to a human priest just for the spirit bonus.
---
Good one, mate
---
By the way, your post history suggests mental health issues. Yikes.
---
I was a GM for a decently successful guild up through Cata, but would I ever mention that in game? Hell no, I never wanna deal with GM drama again.
---
what target macro do you use? i could use one
---
There are a couple possibilities, with many of them all likely factors that influenced the decision of what faction to play.
---
Those people who played alliance before, maybe they want to be horde this time.  If you did it as alliance, why not try the other side this time?
---
Horde racial abilities are much better for pvp.  If you want to PvP you are more likely to roll Horde.  THe last census data we did have showed Horde having a decent advantage on PvP servers and those servers making up the bulk of the playerbase.
---
While salvation is amazing for raiding, the fights can easily be done without it.  It will be interesting to see how BWL goes, but that's really the big draw for Alliance for the try hards and it's something you can relatively get around, so the draw isn't there as much to play alliance.
---
It's an older game and isn't balanced perfectly to cater to reducing frustration like retail got, for example I am the most prolific teamkiller on my service using infernals to wipe low level horde and it is hilarious.
---
I'll take a 58 who knows the dungeon and also wants to run it quickly and efficiently over a 60 who doesnt know wtf is going on
---
They are worth 25% honor.  50% reduced honor from a repeat kill, killing the honorless targets the first time was the 100% honor kill.  The ressed player only has 50% health, and most players are not going to let them heal to 100%, so it is really 25% of the regular honor, and a bit less than killing a level 60 player since they are probably in ungoro to quest on their way to 60 still.
---
My gosh what an utter dunce.
---
TIfuckingL
---
Magic dmg is not much more effective, else they would be top dps in any situation. It's more like every class with magic damage has ways to avoid mob hitting them, or to heal themselves while doing damage, when as a warrior you can't help but take the full dps the mob can deliver, you're always melee and can't control anything the mob do. And the worst is, you deal really good damage only once you take a lot of damage through rage.
---
Maybe read the post properly then? People are explaining the clear advantages horde have over alliance, you have to be some special kind of deluded to genuinely think otherwise.
---
Go to retail.

fucking boomer trying to shit talk me like crazy when he was wrong and now you deleted your messages lol

yeah im sure you can pve just fine with your setup but ive been finding it hard at lvl 50 on a pvp server getting to 60 because im behind the pack and getting ganked constantly
---
How the fuck would you know if it's an exaggeration? Were you there? No? Then do us all a favour and shut your fucking mouth. Thanks.
---
Sure. Like I said, if you want to be pedantic, phase 6 will be the end of classic (for now) and there will be better weapons at that time. But for right now, there is a current BiS and that is the end game, for right now. I don’t know how to be more clear than that.

The code probably only works quest to quest. While I agree with what you are saying it's a lot more work to make all of those suggestions than just make it go from point A to point B at X speed. Anyone who coded anything will know that things get more complex when you always have the NPC do a range check with the player and change its behavior based on that.
---
I appreciate that, but I am unfortunately eastern NA.
---
What you are asking for is a pretty dynamic system to be designed and implemented.
---
You could also just go on a pve server.
---
Maybe, but when I /who the name, it was a guildless level 1 in Elwynn forest, so I concluded that it was new
---
It's easy to get but limited and RNG drops. Took my guild 10 weeks to get an eye for our priests, so we only have one Benediction even though we've been clearing MC for a while now.
---
I don't really think Blizzard cares where they get their money from, you have to pay a sub in order to play classic, if you're not logging into retail they could care less.
---
&gt; Right now doing any open world farming is dangerous and nearly impossible. Because of this fact the items and resources acquired by farming in the open world have drastically increased in price. Meaning for those able to actually farm them their time is compensated drastically. This is a great thing.
---
translation: *people without jobs might be able to profit from this situation, which is a great thing*
---
no.
---
I think he's broken everyone.
---
Nobody knew how few servers there'd be until they announced the few they originally planed to release with. Then people got stuck with their guild. It's a simple fact we're dealing with overpopulation on a lot servers because of the way they rolled out new servers and transfers. Everyone knew there'd be tons of pvp in p2. Nobody knew before hand how overpopulated the servers would be and by the time they did know there weren't any good alternatives.
---
Back then it just started getting slower, it wasn't until maybe cata or MoP where it got really bad, and obviously that would leak over into classic as many players in classic always played WoW and just quit retail because classic was released.
---
ITT: People who don’t actually know how spy works and are getting outraged over nothing.
---
This needs implementing in a hot fix. Immediately. Good idea OP. I'm on board.
---
I guess. I anticipated this and haven't participated in the world honor farming. I've barely logged on since Thursday, just for a few minutes to get a mage port and make a mooncloth. I canceled my sub too. I'll be back when they add faction specific queues or battlegrounds. The few things that I enjoy in this phase of the game are now all drowned out by a horde of tryhards all trying to farm honor.
---
It entirely ruins world pvp. Because of this addon it’s impossible to hide inside a building from an incoming raid because they will find you since they know you’re nearby. It’s like playing on a flat world with no obstacles. To make it worse, priests can target you and use mind vision to spot your exact location. Hunters and Warlocks can send their pet your way. This addon gives players superhuman senses. Rogues have it the worst of all. They’re supposed to be sneaky, and not have a buzzer go off every time they press stealth. In any other game Spy would be considered a map hack but somehow in Classic it’s allowed. 
---
This addon goes against everything Vanilla pvp stands for and the only people who defend it are those who cannot pvp without it.
---
Can confirm, I'm also on Benediction and most Alliance don't really care to PvP, myself included. If they opened transfers to a PvE server, I'd be gone so fast. 
---
I didn't even originally want to roll on a PvP server, but my friends were rolling one and I wanted to play with them. Now I'm the only one left, and I get madder at them every day for making me roll a character here. I thought about rerolling, but seeing my /played made me nix that idea extremely quickly.
---
the little bm ofc
---
Pretty much. Warriors and mages are usually the only matchups that require most cooldowns. Otherwise you can kinda pick and choose one or two cooldowns like blind/thistle tea/vanish.
---
Good meme..?
---
Mankrik for sure
---
I feel like warlock is the most popular 'primary alt' class in classic. Just the other day I ran Deadmines on my own lock, and as our group filled out, what other dps classes did we pick up? Two more warlocks, of course, both in popular end content guilds on my realm. The kicker is that our dps perfectly scaled with level: the lowest lvl lock, lvl 17, did the least; me at lvl 19 was #2 and the lv 21 lock was at #1 of course, since lv 20 is when you unlock RoF.
---
No, it's really not.
---
People who tend to play games with the goal of griefing or 'dunking' on other people tend to gravitate to the "evil" "angry" and "rough" side. The competitive PVP tryhards go to Horde. Competitive try-harding tends to attract a certain type of player. 
---
Players who enjoy trolling others tend to play the side that you know, *actually has trolls.*
---
That's just psychology. People who play Horde don't want to admit their preferred faction attracts these type of people, but they do. Always has, always will.
---
Ever go to Blizzcon and watch a WOW release video and see the Horde boo down the Alliance while people wearing Alliance T's sit quietly while the Horde players scream at the video when their guy does something? Cause I have. BFA was like watching Alliance get verbally beaten for enjoying the game while the Horde were like a zerg of weird faction pride that the Alliance just doesn't seem to care to take as much part in.
---
Agreed, Druids have insane utility I love bringing a feral in a 5 man.
---
Daaaaaamn I only get my coke in white dust format...
---
Everyone talking about ice block and blink haha, Frost nova as an ability itself is broken when it comes to vanilla.
---
Try waking up early and doing it when most people aren't online
---
&gt; There are low pop servers for a reason. 
---
stop talking if you have no real clue.
---
ah ok so I use this for sap right now. so I guess that's good enough

Thanks!

---
It means you don't know what you are talking about if you think there would be no pvp with vanilla sized servers,
---
Haven’t had this happen and I’ve been in some contested zones. But this is just my experience. Maybe because I have a mount, but I don’t see how you can’t get away after getting killed 2-3 times.
---
Coming from an Alliance point of view having a dungeon entrance camped and I’m not just talking about BRD, it’s any high level dungeon I have zero sympathy for you. i’m on a  PVP server and  Horde is the popular faction like most PVP servers and I could probably only count on one hand the amount of times i’ve entered any of these dungeons when a group of horde where not camping the entrance so you just need to suck it up and get on with it
---
As for the other problems, that’s shit and I feel you pain it’s happened to me a few times. Best thing to do is name and shame the ninja on the server and just don’t group up with any of them again.
---
No. Just no.
---
If you didn't want PvP, you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server. End of story.
---
"But muh ganks" yeah it's a pvp server dude. What did you expect? We all saw this coming, from before the phases were even outlined. Roll PvE, dungeon level, or deal with it.
---
"Large scale PvP isn't fun" Ok, that's your opinion, you don't have to participate if you don't want but don't hate on people who enjoy it.
---
"The factions aren't balanced" BGs don't fix this issue. Does it give the underrepresented faction a way to "win some"? Sure, I guess? But it doesn't fix the bajillion other issues with bad faction balance, like control of BRM and dungeon entrances, control of world bosses, or control of gathering mats. It's a drop in the bucket.
---
First off, this is a short term issue. There's at most a couple months of PvP with no BGs. Maybe you don't find it fun, and I'm not a huge fan of ultra-large scale lag fest battles myself. But the constant skirmishes over BRM and neutral towns has been fun as hell to me. And I've had several great PvP skirmish battles fighting over the elemental spawns in felwood and EPL, or over the flight masters in tanaris/everlook. Small fights are all over the place on my server, you don't *have* to go to hillsbrad and join the 200v200 clusterfuck to do pvp.
---
Excuse my ignorance
---
What changes from level 58 to 59 that's so damn big?
---
It's clear that a 55 from 60 is a big leap, but 1 level?
---
What's that 1 level difference going to make that bad?
---
like, the trolls make magical juices... so it's only a matter of time.
---
It wasn't really a big reach, it was quite literally a 50-50 ;)
---
Yes yes.... shouldn’t have rolled on a PVP server if you didn’t want to be unable to travel via gryphon place to place Git Gud Newb
---
Killing lowbies doesn't give you DHK's, where are you getting this info from lol. It never has and never will. Killing NPC civilians give you dhks.
---
Phase 1 had layers
---
I mean I already changed my combat log settings and feel perfectly safe in the world without spy. 
---
If it was doing something that wasn't feasible in game then I would be on board with everyone's complaints. But it is literally doable already. You don't even need spy to do all the things spy can do. And unlike dps and dbm, add-ons that would require insane math skills and tracking and probably outside software, you can do all the stuff for spy in game with time stamped combat log for enemies only with auras turned on. You then just /tar people as they get close, and if you feeling frisky you can /who them as well.
---
Where is the lie!?
---
I'm a partial clicker. I still click for changing stances and some other skills. For warriors, there are way too many skills to keybind everything and still be faster than clicking.
---
Damn this was intense
---
I was gm for a while, our guild did nothing of value
---
Libram of Focus is 45g on my server. Just got my T2 helm and want to enchant it before the next raid on Saturday.
---
Just wait a quarter of a second. Don't make it easy to get a simultaneous gouge/vanish.
---
No, the point of wpvp is that there are minimal limiting factors.  If you can't handle it, there are pve servers.
---
Please, everywhere is camped. Redridge? Safe from gankers? What magical server do you live on?
---
&gt;level 50 undead rogue here
---
&gt;I’m a bit too low for ST
---
Say what the what now?
---
I'm not sure how this supports your claim that the servers are 4:1.
---
The only available information shows that to be untrue, universally.
---
I just want the KoS list. Everything else is luxury.
---
It's easy, nedd if you are going to use it, greed if you aren't. Rare world boe's, travelers backpacks, and orbs ect.. Should be needed on by all to prevent ninjas.
---
Lol, nice one
---
If you have spy how in the world are you getting charged?
---
Hunters doing this quest affects non hunters too.  You all think killing the burning steppes demon on the road right in the middle of my herbalism route is a good thing, and then somehow fail it.
---
Same with the silithus one.  One time I stopped to help give the hunter curse of reck, only to find out he never trained max rank wing clip.
---
I’ve found that Ret paladins advertising as dps or heals are generally self aware enough to realize they aren’t top dps and are willing to sacrifice their damage for utility. Biggest example is using justice on mobs that flee instead of every judgment having to be righteousness or command. A Ret paladin healing higher level dungeons may not work but this was my experience leveling. I will never invite any paladin that would not even consider healing though.
---
I'd still say it was a reach to assume I am a 'victim' of phase 2, based on me asking for context for a bad meme.
---
For PvP ranks the third rank gives you 10% of goods form your faction, does this include mounts? O
---
n top of the 10% you get with being honored? I'm asking as I have enough for my epic mount but I think I may be rank 3 tomorrow so I'm wondering if I should wait and I'd save gold.
---
Can confirm - I play Classic Wow and am that bald
---
maybe he isnt playing for a challenge, he might enjoy his play time by trying to annoy players of the other faction. we each play this game for different reasons,
---
yikes lmao
---
Never been on a pve server have you?  Always people willing to fight.  Not ganking, which is what you do right?
---
&gt; Horde should have rolled alliance if they wanted better queues. They made their choice, and they can try to improve it by transferring or re-rolling. I guess the counter argument is that alliance shouldn't have rolled on the smaller faction if they didn't want to get corpse camped in phase 2, but which players choice is better for the game overall?
---
I like how you answered your own stupid argument.
---
Roll horde we have cookie
---
This isn't world pvp on a pvp server rofl. You actualyl gain nothing from just spamming AE explosion at a flight master for 2 hours straight.
---
ZT server on Europe seems to be the other way. Almost feel like ally outweigh horde 3-1
---
Even worse, when the escort gets on a mount but still moves much slower than you walk.  I'm looking at you Tyrion Fordring.  Also, that quest was absolute hell to get done on a PvP server this weekend.
---
I can't remember what it was called. I just remember during cata having 2v2 against warriors that could full heal on a few hits.
---
Allowing transfers will only make faction balance worse. That was my entire point. I don't understand your comment
---
Rag should drop a gray item... a bottle that says R.A.I.D.
---
I'd say it's *potentially* soloable, but it'll prob be a huge headache. You'll likely need to clear out some sections via kiting mobs ahead of time, and noxxion may or may not have ranged attacks that might make kiting impossible. Idk his mechanics well enough.
---
If you just want the scepter so you can do princess farm runs, then join a group and breeze through it. It'll go faster, and people would prob be happy to have a 60 hunter carrying them.
---
Princess farming is only doable because tinkerer is a pushover, rotgrip won't aggro any other mobs (except hydras), and princess only has 1 long CD ranged attack that you can outrange and a huge area to kite her.
---
Lol? Why would aoe groups take classes like rogues other than invis sapper. Mages are one of the best ranking classes a lot of the top honor ones are mages/locks.
---
I'm not going to tell you exactly what to do, but I honestly think holy priest is one of the better phase 2 pvp classes. Just one hint, you shouldn't be in a group with anyone else
---
I’m not about to argue with a complete dunce who’s comparing DBM to a gamebreaking pvp addon. I have standards and I know when something is utterly futile.
---
Can you vanish/fd during a boss fight to use jumper cables?
---
I remember being able to rez during Shazzrah on vanilla.
---
Seems we can't drop combat anymore during the fight correct?  Is this because spell batching is different?
---
That specific scenario isn't even worthy of discussion with Dire Maul out now. There are two trinkets in DM that are both either equivalent or better to HoJ for Hunters (Lodestone, and Royal Seal). Arguably, Hunters should have stopped rolling for HoJ (even on a BiS basis) as soon as DM was announced, since it was released within a couple weeks of announcement.
---
At least you can play with that bug my tion was pre LVL 60 and I haven't been able to even play since launch it's crazy almost like it's impossible to level now.
---
this is a joke right?  did you stop to think what would happen if OP has his rule set added to the game? if anything i think it would make it worse then it already is.

Thanks! I'll have to try this out when I get home!
---
This is why battlegrounds won't fix it. The people doing this aren't doing it for honor, they're doing it just to fuck with others and it's not pvp, it's griefing.
---
Cross realm battlegrounds aren’t implemented yet giant ass servers are the problem.
---
**stop trying to change my game**, this have been completely expected, and is expected to last until battlegrounds, which should not be added **faster** because of snowflakes such AS yourself.
---
Fuck honor.
---
If I lived back in samurai times I'd be a ninja assassinating people with my justsu
---
If you're doing three 40 man raids on FPs and you already are 70% of the server, dont get mad when the other faction transfers off.
---
&gt; now people are mad they were given what they wanted
---
This defines retail wow for the last 10 years
---
In your opinion. Not the same as "60s content is more fun than leveling. There is no disagreeing with that"
---
Spirit of aquementas is a caster item obviously...
---
Hey so i did this quest 2 weeks ago, then i helped my guild hunter friend do it last night after he got the leaf so i will give advice on all 4!!
---
Antorus in winterspring: This one was the first i did and i wiped maybe 4 times or so. I honestly found him super challenging and i killed him as i died. Get some friends to come help you and inform them to kill all beasts on the path as u kite antorus onto the main road. Keep serpent sting damaging him, arcane shot rank 1 to keep aggro, and use concussive shot when you feel the need to keep range. IF you do get the debuff you will die, so at this point just go all out, because you are not living and thats how i killed him, ask a warlock for a healthstone too if needed. Tranq shot him wen enraged!
---
2. Solenor the slayer of Silithus: This one i one shot and here are the things to make it EZ mode. Go get a warlock friend to use curse of recklessness on you by dueling you, then start the fight! If you are good at weaving autos in as a hunter this ones very simple. Pull him , do ur ranged combo and when he gets close wing clip him which traps him in place for a while, get some distance, rapid fire and shoot away. he will spawn bugs but you just ignore them, and kite them, as you murder the boss walking in circles basically. Bring a shadow protection pot to make this fight easier as he will deal some high damage without! i didnt use a pot and i killed him with low hp left over.
---
3. simone the seductress of un'goro: This one is wierd, i again killed her and had a few hp remaining as the pet was close to me. Also you want to fight her in the coordinates i believe 30,47 but im not 100% sure im not home at the moment to confirm, but its basically next to the water pool. Treat this fight like princess from mara solo'ing. On pull do your max ranged combo on simone followed by a conc shot, and have a freezing trap down for her pet so then its just you and simone. Kite her max distance, bait out her chain lightnings, keep serpent sting up, and weave in autos whenever. The pet will join the fight again but just do whatever means needed to keep it away, such as scatter shot, conc shot, or wing clip. after you kill simone just loot the head, FD, and the pet leaves!!
---
4.Klinfran the crazed of burning steps: Man oh man this one gave me a run for my money, i wiped like 5 times before i understood how to do this one, because he requires you to NOT play like a typical hunter and basically live in melee range. But once you get the dance down for this dude you legit kill him with 90% of your hp as he doesn't actually do damage. So lets break it down! Start with your slowing trap down, and at a max range, and do your typical aimed multi opener, most important thing is your basically waiting for his Enrage to happen, as soon as he enrages you must scorpid sting, go into melee distance, auto 3 times then wing clip rank 1 then walk away. You do this rotation because he will enrage after around 3 autos so it fits in perfectly. Melee 3 times&gt; wing clip rank 1&gt; go get distance and dont think about auoting or anything and just wait for that enrage then scorpid sting it&gt; rinse repeat. Once you get this dance down you could practically do this guy in full greens as he's autoing you for 9 while your autoing like 250.
---
Thats my overall advice for this quest and i assure you its super fun and rewarding once you get it down!
---
Which Alliance populated US server has the biggest/best economy?
---
Hearthing doesn't work anymore. They've moved on to having mages camp innkeepers now too.
---
Their speed is a part of the challenge. A lot of escort quests would be easy if you had control over when you take on the predetermined groups, and by forcing you into the engagements at a decent pace it means that the challenge inappropriate for the levels it intends.
---
If you were to adjust speeds, it would need to change in other ways to account for how much easier it would be.
---
Yet here you are further replying but failing to actually deliver an argument.
---
The IQ on this lad lmao. Preventing combat log will break damage meters, bossmodes and logging, three of the most important addons.
---
[This should properly explain PvP for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0)
---
If I had known people as dense as you were reading it, I'd have added a /s tag
---
Kill. Everything.
---
You said you can't find a group.
---
I said make your own.
---
You got pissy.
---
Sounds like you just don't want to make a group.
---
To me, that sounds like a much more challenging and engaging method...
---
RemindMe! 280 hours
---
Unless he was rocking a gray headpiece you good bra.
---
lol at the horde in here saying that they havent found the questing so bad.
---
To the OP, a party of 5 aint gonna do shit with the size of the groups roaming around.  I agree that people have to adapt.  Maybe dont fly into lights hope and run from chillwind?  Oh wait, chillwind is taken.  OK, run from Southshore.  Oh.. wait..
---
You can’t transfer pve to pve?? I know you can’t pve to pvp but pve to pve seems silly
---
You're not wrong. 
---
I can't say whether it would be an upgrade for him...but I can say that rolling on something that clearly benefits another class more is a dick move. 
---
Also... druid should be looking for spirit and plus healing for healing, over int.
---
too late i already re-rolled  on a pve server, got to 60 clear'd MC 4 times this week and am bored already, need more content,
---
im just wondering how you can pvp if there is no one pvp flagged? couldn't stand that about pve servers, it's like you have to wait for someone to be like "ok now I feel comfortable with you attacking me" which is not true open world pvp, more scripted.
---
If it's red, it's dead.
---
I guess it's all various experiences.
---
This is is my first time playing WOW and I rolled as a crappy human protection warrior on the Fairbanks server (which I think its Horde dominated). However so far at level 47 I'm still able to quest mostly in peace. Sure there have been more ganks from higher levels, but I find it very fun and love the dangerous aspect of it as OP mentioned. 
---
I guess it helps playing with my buddy that forced me to start playing wow, but I could see how it could be worse for solo players.
---
Blaming imbalance on the player is shortsighted. How would people know the faction balance at the time they create their character if Blizzard never provided any data on faction balance. Blizzard should have had some kind of balancing mechanism but they failed to do so.
---
Maybe you're right though. The imbalance is the fault of all the people that have decided to roll Horde. Those people can fix the imbalance problem by leaving Horde and coming to Alliance.
---
Its literally an argument towards getting change out there and blizzard doing something to fix the imbalance. Lot of apologists said blizz shouldnt change anything because this is #nochange vanilla. You ok bud?
---
Merging servers is almost the same as removing layers.  It is much easier to merge than split, so they should have just planned for that.
---
Like 60 guilds cleared naxx pre2.0, yet somehow those 60 guilds had 10,000+ players.
---
I feel like I have a tool for so many situations. I can wear mail with a shield, so I take way less damage than something like a Priest. Tremor Totem, Grounding Totem, Windfury Totem, Stoneskin Totem - I have a totem for so many situations. Water Walking, Water Breathing, Cure Poison, Cure Disease, Reincarnation, and a Rezz spell makes me feel like I just have so many problem-solving spells.
---
I'm trying to figure out how people are actually taking flights at all tbh. the flight masters are dead.
---
Pod transfer definitely allows PvP to PvE but not the other way
---
Great, I can name one random example and point to it to validate my point to.  My group of 10 battled the same group of 10 in ungoro for 40 minutes and had fun fighting for better terrain, recruiting help, losing and winning.  It was challenging, balanced wpvp enabled by the pvp system and the focus on it via honor.  My point isn’t that the system is balanced or perfect.  My point is in order to get the good that people say they want, wpvp, there is a downside.  People continue to basically say, I want wpvp, but only if it fits my definition of fun, challenge, balance, etc and on my schedule.
---
lmao, are you a widdle sad about a vidya game there lil feller?
---
Lol this made me laugh. It’s out of control!
---
I have started avoiding roads in an effort to spend less time in the same places as 60s, because they will kill me every time. I have also noticed an increase in assaults on our towns, and more violence around goblin cities.
---
Among other levelers, there seems to be an uneasy truce in place - I have been forced out of a grinding area by a non-60 just once since the introduction of honor. If I keep my distance groups of Alliance seem content to let me take the quest mobs I need.
---
They don't get honor from killing people landing at a flightpath btw. They are doing it to grief, not to farm. They want you to quit, that's it.
---
It's only going to go down when people transfer off. 
---
I also have been thinking of the idea of transfering off to arcanite reaper to avoid the queues on my server. 
---
The crappy thing is imbalance. My servers already close to 70:30 horde to alliance and if I swap I feel eventually there will be no more alliance on the server.
---
Hillsbrad is fun, just use your brain and break off to flank with mounts instead of standing behind your mage line. 5-10 people can scatter the whole raid.
---
Somebody told me in vanilla to just jump out of the window and I died in the lava (I did not have prequest and didn't know about the prequest since I was a kid)
---
I until very recently also thought it was a joke.
---
Haha - horde smolderweb here. I encountered dispo the other night in some PvP. All his engineering trinkets, items, and hunter tricks couldnt save him. Was an insanely good fight though! Will see ya around!
---
yes, but i might pee in it
---
If you click the portal is it sexual harassment?
---
Was it the Savage Gladiator? If so that's triple extra fucked up.
---
I agree with this entire post. Especially about the invisibility potions and not flying to stupid ass spots. I mean, this is WARcraft so clearly you gotta be prepared! Thanks for saying what we were all thinking
---
well it's my reason
---
100% drop improved devo aura
---
he's horde on a horde dominated server , gehennas.
---
Plus that 58 is going to be willing to spam run the dungeon if you get a good group.
---
Yeah I should be around the 17-23 sacs range.
---
I did LBRS and Scholo on the weekend. Both runs went amazingly well. LBRS had a 58 mage and I think a 59 something. Scholo we had a 57 hunter. 
---
Good times were had by all. Felt good to help out some sub-60 folks.
---
nice work I hope I get to be part of a sapper wipe but no one in my guild really cares or carries sappers, only like 5 others
---
rofl I haven't seen this video in 10 years
---
if the total pop of all the servers has an imbalance there will be wait times. they may not be long but there will still be wait times
---
&gt; "how can we design this piece of shit in a way to get the most money out of everyone"
---
You complain about games being designed to get money out of people...
---
&gt; we had Double Dragon on NES, it was so hard it only had 4 levels but we still loved it because it wasnt supposed to be a game everybody can complete.
---
... then you use an example of a game that was designed for an arcade where games were purposely made difficult to get more money out of people.
---
mods are gonna remove this. they dont allow standard meme templates
---
That still ignores the fact that the guy I replied to is trying to fly into thorium point lol literally like the most common camp spot in the game right next to brm entrance. 
---
I'm on Skeram alliance btw, highly populated server with one of the worst faction imbalances in horde favor but I get by rather than crying about it.
---
Are they actually worth 25% less honor? you never got honor off them in the first place why would there be DR?
---
Camping isn't fun for either party. It kills the game I like.
---
My enjoyment is less affected than the campers, because I get to occasionally play the game. They don't.
---
There's an addon called HonorSpy, it's kind of jankey so we'll see. It says it inspects people around you and it helps if you mouse over but my sample size is still pretty small. I've been inspecting people in town to help it out.
---
Both of those things are impractical. For one, Catseye Potion is just that: a potion. It shares a CD with FAP, Purification, Major Healing or any other potion-type consumable. Realistically, no one will use a Catseye unless they 1.) happen to actually have one, and 2.) somehow don’t need their survivability pots. Second, you can’t swap gear, other than weapons/offhand, while in combat. If a rogue vanishes and gives you time to swap to new headgear *and* doesn’t just Sap or Blind, that rouge is terrible and needs to turn in his daggers. 
---
I won’t make any excuses for rogues in this patch. They have an incredible amount of tools to win fights. Complaining about *one* ability (with a 5 min CD no less) that *might* give people some modicum of defense is just pathetic. It’s like complaining about Will of the Forsaken or War Stomp, but at least those are always useful.
---
And true open world pvp is a pile of garbage.  Gank squads, over leveled assholes killing anyone they can.  How is that fun?  Its not.  Been there, done that, done with wasting my time.  If you want a true world pvp game there are much better ones out there.
---
Bgs will be out with in a couple weeks lol.
---
Devilsaur mafia
---
wow cant believe he sold loot to his guild members. I'd quit that guild so fast
---
Assuming that you are keeping your wand up to date, you can just CoA &gt; Corruption &gt; Wand.
---
If you grouped every single alliance on servers like skeram or gehennas, EVERY SINGLE ONE, you'd just die.
---
I don't see how your comment is relevant to mine at all. OP was asking for PvP to PvE transfers which currently don't exist, and would make faction balance worse. So my point is that they should continue to not exist so faction balance doesn't get worse.
---
You seem to be telling me "not to get mad when ppl transfer" which they can't currently do and I'm saying they shouldn't be allowed to do.
---
I won't be mad because Blizzard won't let them leave lol.
---
Anyways I play on a 50/50 server
---
The moment you realize that you're a rapist..
---
Dont even bother mate. These anti-addon crowds has a collective IQ of your average shoesize.
---
&gt; I feel like it was kinda shitty for him to roll on a piece clearly meant for locks/spriests when there was a lock in the group who had already rolled need. Am I wrong?
---
You're asking a question about ethics to which there is no answer.
---
***
---
Playing devil's advocate, if you weighted the value of the +shadow damage to be absolutely minimal/insignificant (pretend it didn't exist) and you were a caster in the same circumstances why wouldn't you roll need?
---
They lose their honorless status if they fight back, which most do. Pro tip: don’t fight it. Let it happen.
---
So, you think it's cool to show up to a raid in shit gear and get carried for months? I'll file you under dumb lazy cunt.
---
Ok, so is typing /tar t the same as clicking my name? We can dance this dance, if you want. Im willing, lol. 
---
&gt; usually if I see anyone pop up in my combat log I try and stop what in doing and invis. Sure they'll see "Elkram is stealthed nearby," but they won't know where and that's usually enough of a deterrent to keep people from killing me.
---
Sounds exactly like a PVE server. Turn your flag off if you don't like your odds in combat. Shoulda just rolled a PVE server, dude.
---
I got to re-live this quest last week and managed to blow through it playing later at night. I would also suggest picking up the Demonslayer sword, Demonslaying enchant and Demonslaying Potions. I got all 3 on my server for under 20g and the stun from the Enchant and the added Attack Power came in clutch a few times.
---
Shadowmeld is great for wpvp too. Drinking in stealth after 1v1ing someone is so damn nice as the roaming horde deathsquad rolls by haha
---
Look dude, they just don't care. This has /nothing/ to do with honor. The giant raids sitting at flightmasters and such? You know that people when they land give 0 honor right? It has NOTHING to do with honor, it's just trying to grief people. This is why battlegrounds WILL NOT fix this.
---
It did work. I played BFA for awhile after launch and it was constant PvP while people fought at world quests and stuff.
---
Till then, the mods can fuck themselves
---
I love my Rhok but Crossbow of Smiting will be so awesome. 3.4 speed hnggggh
---
The queue times for Faerlina are ridiculous. How is Earthfury/ is it worth it to switch over? Only time I've been able to log on are weekends in the morning.
---
Until he gets to the end and spawns the caster mobs that almost instagib him, sure.
---
The escort part of that quest isn't the hard part lol
---
Yes, obviously they only want the experience if it is fun. That is the point of playing a game, after all. If it mostly isn't fun, they won't want it. 
---
The current status of the game is kind of a mess. It isn't much fun at all for many people, even those who generally enjoy pvp. I don't mind the occasional gank squad. I do mind when it has become accepted that the correct way to get to BRD is to die ten times and run as a ghost for quite some time.
---
I took a look at Blizzard's Shadowlands page and it's incomprehensible to me. I don't want to deal with that learning curve (not having played since Wotlk). I don't want to play the game confused, having no context and no idea why things are the way they are, knowing zero history behind the changes.  
---
Just, no.
---
Yeah, could just be bad luck/math.  If it’s 17-23% you could technically kill 830, get nothing then get 170 in a row and still fall within that drop rate percentage.
---
It's funny how I am talking about what is good for the game, and blizzards bottom line, and stuff like that but you interpret this as selfishness?
---
Do you think that there should be no negative impact for the dominant faction on a server that is 70/30 or 80/20?
---
I am advocating for what i think is best for the game.  In fact, i am advocating against my long term interests.  If more horde join alliance, I will have longer queue times in phase 3.
---
TIL raising an issue and asking blizzard to interfere is whining. I rolled on pvp server yes, but when i did i didnt know blizz will do absolutely sweet fuck all to balance the factions. I want wpvp, but what we have is something else. You're on pve good on you, but it also means you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. People spend thousands of gold just on pvp consumables, you go out there, kill the smaller groups, get rolled over by the larger group, thats it. Its a mindless honorfarm, nobody cares about the fight itself, just the numbers. I dont personally see how it is fun for anyone, but thats another topic.
---
In our guild we go Eye&gt;Leaf&gt;Eye&gt;Leaf since first MC clear. To the point we thought it was by design.
---
When people quickly roll greed on BoE blues and purples, I just die a little inside. From that moment, it becomes a Mexican standoff of slowly watching everyone else hit "greed" to make the roll fair and waiting for the moment when the last person makes their choice - need and get the BoE instantly or greed with honor. None of that anxiety would be present if everyone just hit "need" on those. Most of the time, it's not a real upgrade for you, just an upgrade for your wallet, so everyone rolling "need" just makes that unambiguous. Even better would be to lay out the rules before you make the first pull.
---
Any horde rogues have advice on a leveling guide? I just got the game today and I want to catch up to my friends who are all at least in their 30s, so I want to get through early game as fast as possible considering I have done it 100 times over 10  years ago. So far I have seen classicwow.live, Bustea's guidelime, and tactics rogue leveling guide. Tactics is written for rogues apparently, but I don't necessarily need to get to 60 as fast as possible. I don't mind taking a couple extra days if I have a lot more gold/gear, so having that in mind is there a better one?
---
Is there a command that makes the wisp sound not cause bleed to ears?
---
I'm going to install a second mouse just so I can down vote this more. 
---
This is not world PvP, this is not authentic to its original. It's just justified chaos. It's basically Azeroth's version of The Purge.
---
must be nice sitting in brm with 200 others waiting for the 1by1 respawn of the opposite faction
---
I'm finding this really hard to believe if he doesn't have 1) Blessing of Sanctuary and 2) a lot of spellpower for Rank 1 Consecration
---
Truth. Menethil and every 50-60 zone camped eternally by deathsquads. Leveling zones are free and clear!
---
Source please?
---
Getting ganked isnt pvp.  It takes no skill.  How about you fuck off? Go tell your mommy that you are upset because the internet person doesnt play the game like you and it makes you sooo upset.  Loser.
---
You didn't think this out at all. Lv 1 suicide runs into AoE would become the new meta. The next time you have an idea, just let it go.
---
can we stop lying to ourselves by saying horde has better racials for pvp?
---
Heard about escape artist? Stoneform?
---
I'm convinced I get hoodwinked sometimes. Is there a way for someone to trick TSM or Auctioneer to automatically post your items for too low?
---
If you want BGs, the BG pvp scene on retail exists? If you don't want PvP at all, there's PvE servers.
---
"PvPers are fragile" what hypocrisy lol. This is a phase of giant world PvP battles that we will *never see again* and you guys just want to bulldoze over it till you get the content *you* want. Calm down and nut up, it's 2 months at most if they DON'T move it up which we all know they probably will. Quit complaining about a crazy, fun, and never to be seen again phase. Obviously BGs will make this experience non-existent because of how the ranking system works in classic. Trying to pretend like it won't is just burying your head in the sand.
---
Sure, open up transfers. When did I say I had an issue with xfers? If people fucked up and rolled on a server that they don't like, let them leave, I don't care in the slightest.
---
I find it a little funny to see a horde crying over getting ganked while trying to do a single quest. Boo hoo. Follow the guides and play at an ungodly hour to complete your one quest. How would you feel if you had 200 quests to complete and it was the same for every one. That’s how alliance feel on most of the pvp servers. I know this is pretty negative but you’d feel the same facing what a lot of us are facing.
---
I don't think it matters much this phase on the +healing buff. I'd say when BWL drops and you guys are pushing progression you'd likely miss it then but nothing in this phase should have you missing the +25 HP here.
---
World PvP is not solo. Most people tend to go in at least small groups.
---
&gt; They opted for less servers because they expect many to quit...
---
Might happen with the fucking mess PvP servers are atm.
---
WTF!!! I could have used this a while ago when I was in the badlands.:D
---
How are lowbies going to be able to level up if questing/grinding is completely fucked by gank squads and the only other option, dungeons, is being gatekeeped by the 60s?
---
They aren't pvping, enemies that just landed or spawned dont' reward honor. They're trying to grief, not earn rewards.
---
Well usually when you kill low levels they call in the higher levels.  Most of the low levels i've came across even before p2 if they see you in a fight they will all jump in and try and help take you down even if i was being nice to them and helping with a quest so now i just kill everything and everyone. I also love to know ppl are raging over a game because i just killed them, i also send my guild mates to the grave yard to catch them spirit rezzing trying to hearth out. ;)
---
I can di better in just one day of bg. All this efford for  little
---
Your warrior's dead, he passed in his sleep
---
Oh shit thanks for that! I didn't know it was a book! Kept seeing it on other priests and people but didnt know what it was from..
---
"I had a different experience than you so you're being dramatic."
---
AITA?
---
yes. yes you are
---
Absolute madman
---
Almost as if gaming itself is different from 15years ago. Weird
---
The reason for the horde dominating now as opposed to 2005 was because back then, people played what they liked and there was no preparation and knowledge of the game when it was new. 
---
Now people have played this game to death and know all BiS gear, best farm spots, best strats for raids, best addons, ect. So the majority of players want to be the best min/maxers and dominate in PVP. Horde racials are really good in comparison to alliance. 
---
Orc - 25% resist stun (OP as fk)
---
Undead - fear resist 
---
Trolls - increased damage
---
Tauren AOE stun
---
Human - increased chance to spot stealth (not to bad)
---
Dwarf - stone form (also not bad)
---
Night elf- shadow meld (limited uses, only good for hiding as to not get ganked)
---
Gnome - escape artist ( it's ok but the CD sucks)
---
You are the reason why I dont take reddit complaints seriously. This isnt blizzard's fault.  They opened the servers and people cholse where to go. The only way to make you happy is if automated it. Gg
---
I agree with this theory.  The world is only so large, and with this many players, virtually all points of interest can be camped giving no gameplay alternatives for the smaller faction.
---
Says the person playing what is possibly the best 1v1 class in the game who also gets to choose their engagements and hide anytime they are outnumbered lol
---
My advice for warriors while levelling is to get protection-oriented gear(mail and then plate ONLY!!! No leather, you aren't a rogue! and lots of stam, and always keep a decent shield in inventory) while using talents on your choice of fury or arms, and then offering to tank every instance and group quest you can.   
---
Tanks are at a premium demand before reaching endgame, especially now since most people who primarily rolled non-dps classes as their 'main' when classic launched have to heal or tank now on their mains and end up rolling a dps class for a primary alt. This means LFG is full of "tank and heals then gtg" and you have the luxury of choosing which dungeon you want to do on demand as long as you tank for it, basically.
---
You can complete entire groups of levels if you merely opt to level in dungeons and unlike the dangers you speak of associated with questing, tanking an instance is relatively safer.
---
&gt; It doesn't feel like a real world when you have enemies unable to fight each other.
---
You mean gank each other, because you can engage in consensual PvP on a PvE server at any time. Hillsbrad is often a battleground on my server for groups of players who want to engage in large-scale world PvP. The difference is we have a CHOICE. If we want to quest, farm mobs, run a dungeon or engage in PvP, we have the freedom to do what we want. Being on a PvP server, especially if you're on a severely outnumbered faction, you may not have that freedom.
---
Thems the rules but let the record show I got a sensible chuckle out of it.
---
Not to mention you can aim for different builds and talents depending on what azerite traits you pursue/obtain. And before azerite traits even influence your talents you can choose to be so gle target or aoe/multi target focused depending on m+ needs for example.
---
Is XXXX in the client? Seriously, you're runnin out of steam here. Pick a new angle.
---
WTF?
---
I'm saying if hunters aren't getting burned (bc it's supposed to discriminate based on class), then druids shouldn't either and it's a bug.
---
If EVERYONE gets burned, then my fellow druids should just accept it.
---
Its evidently called "content"
---
You're talking about what's good for 'you.' Big difference. Don't conflate what's good for you with what's good for the game.
---
The factions aren't that imbalanced alliance are just terrible at PvP.
---
There's absolutely nothing you can do about the fact that more horde play PvP than allies and allies are just not as good on average as Horde players.
---
&gt; People need to stop trying to 'fix' classic. There are PvE servers for a reason.
---
if they let people freely or paid transfer to them some of this would go away. but they dont
---
They should really change the name from Honor Points to something else because there is no Honor in a gang of max levels one shotting a lowbie that is solo questing.
---
"The primary incentive isn't fun" perfectly describes the gaming community in 2019.  You people care so much about comparing how many lowbies to the next guy that you aren't even playing for fun anymore.  And what is honorable about killing lowbies?  Y'all really are pathetic and obviously terrible at the game.
---
For real.
---
I would not call being greeted by 15 people on the boat in wetlands pvp. Only to be greeted by 3 rogues in Menethil. Only to be jumped by 4 hordes camping the FP in Feralas, taking ress sickness only to be jumped by 3 5 man gangs before reaching the bridge running across the water and having to death run 14 times before reaching DM east starting from the stairs up to DM. 15 v 1 is not pvp.
---
My class has the best Tier sets in the game. 
---
Edit: warrior
---
So level 60s griefing people 30 levels below them in strabglethorn, hilsbrad and arathi should be encouraged?
---
We had cross realm BG's in vanilla and certain factions on very imbalanced battlegroups queues were ~1 hr.  I was on the ruin battlegroup (original server maghteridon) and alliance definitely faced queues that long.
---
You're not even trying at this point.
---
Players that choose the bigger faction are actually more cowardly than people that choose to play on a PvE server.
---
&gt; We've always just unspokenly assumed the normal Need/Greed paradigm: If the item is an upgrade/useful to you, Need on it; if the item is just to sell, Greed on it. We just assume folks are honestly choosing Need or Greed. 
---
this is the right way to do it. keep doing it. you're fine.
---
Oh man, I was with you all the way there. AND THEN EVEN MORE WITH YOU AT THE END. I'm actually on horde, but enhancement shamans are the same thing. Never.
---
yep. We do rogue/rogue/druid and it's almost unstoppable. 2 saps some blinds and roots. NS heals for when things go wrong.
---
Sure, I was aware that Alliance would be the minority faction and was willing to accept that to a certain degree. The question is, how large of an imbalance is acceptable?
---
60H/40A?
---
65H/35A?
---
70H/30A?
---
75H/25A?
---
80H/20A?
---
Then wait.  Its about degree.  If the waiting gets bad enough, people will re-roll or transfer.  We have already seen this phenomenon with realm queues.
---
I played alliance back in 2005. I cant roll horde now, to many players playing horde and I dont want to make matters worse
---
People were legit saying that they dont want to play the game if the skeleton change was made. Like... Are you fucking serious? Imagine after how long Classic has been out and all the experiences you had, that you actually decided to do none of that because of skeletons disappearing after rez. I can think of hardly any times ive even ever considered that
---
Booooooooo
---
you got the bottom one reversed lol i haven't worked out in 20 years
---
The weirdo looking people are usually the ones paying for Blizzcon.
---
You’re a fucking clown. Don’t be pissed then when your shit gets ninjad and Blizzard doesn’t do shit. They will not punish anyone for ninja looting. There’s a blue post from blizzard directly. How could you possibly say IM wrong. LMAO. You clearly don’t have common sense.
---
Google spreadsheet.
---
mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
Where the fuck did i say anything about aoe groups? Anyone who cant solo in hillsbrand can make 4 times the amount of honor per hour in normal groups roaming the world.
---
I fucking hate the Glancing Blow mechanic so much
---
I was just as surprised as you, trust me. He only went prot high enough for the +hit talent... if I recall his spec was template ret DPS.
---
To be fair I did have to spend time stacking sunders on bosses to do "actual" damage, and he did Salv me, but I had a feral buffing me as well and even popped some elixirs to boost my output.
---
Phase 7 = Shadowlands
---
Thats so nice! I rolled hunter as well and I agree it is very good to play it
---
Probably the one percent
---
I was thinking it was the same statistics as pserver and might be incorrect. 4 seems to be the consesus but honestly I've not camped the same person long enough to test and verify. Red = Dead, even if i've killed you 30 times today...
---
If I were designing the game in 2004 I'd make it so that if a goblin guard sees you kill a player who is at least Friendly to them, you lose goblin rep. This would put a cap on these shenanigans without arbitrarily making it impossible.
---
I don't think I'd implement that change now though, most players seem to want the game to stay the same as much as possible.

Corrected for you
---
That shit drives me up a wall. They'll run hundreds of feet forward and backwards for this
---
ye u wont find a single vanilla player using that in any old video but gl
---
Presumably because with the honor system now out and,  as they stated, they're on the unfavored side of the proportion, trying to level 58-60 in the open world is harder than it was a couple weeks ago.
---
I have two level 60 already but I have been thinking for the last few day that it is probably time to start on a third.
---
Why would a ret Pala use a 1h axe?
---
Because WoW released right after the megahit Lord of The Rings and of course every 15 year old wanted to play his favorite Elf, Human or Dwarf.
---
&gt; but when i did i didnt know blizz will do absolutely sweet fuck all to balance the factions
---
Blizzard never did anything in vanilla to balance the factions not sure why you though this would be different
---
This is world pvp. Everyone acts like its 2 max level, evenly matched players contesting a world spawn or quest mob and they have an epic back and forth duel for the ages where 2 toons enter but only 1 leaves victorious. 
---
But in reality its raid groups of max level characters griefing the 21-29 zone, ganking all the lowbies, corpse camping and killing all the NPCs over and over and over again. 
---
World pvp is a lie. There is only torturing players with no chance to defend themselves
---
I’m holy prot and it’s very fun to use in pve and pvp
---
This literally assumes every player reads BIS guides and makes you a scumbag by default for just simply playing the game.
---
I fucking hate BIS guides.
---
We got a second druid a couple weeks ago cuz we only had 1 for a long while. His ass is already 6/8 with a T2 helm. Shits comical.
---
Hence the reasoning for using the Spy addon.
---
Alliance sit on the zeppelins on my server, they respawn every time it changes continents with full health and mana and they just aoe spam any horde dumb enough to fight them.  Seems comparable to this.  Sucks man.
---
You can duel the enemy faction when both parties aren’t flagged on a PVP server too
---
TIL that making a decision means you automatically forfeit your right to discuss ANY consequence linked to that decision.
---
You decided to read this Reddit thread, so why the hell are you triggered by OP? lmao
---
Yep.
---
It saves it for you, you’d only have to retype it if you reinstall wow
---
That's a good weapon to start, but demonshear, dreadforge Retaliator, the polearm from ubrs, or the AP sword from dn north are a lot better.
---
Just tell -50 dkp
---
Wait you can get CC rep right now?! Where?
---
Things like DBM used to track their own addon/version but I've never seen one track other Addons.
---
No I didn’t. 
---
Simply made a statement that npcs only work like that in retail and this is a subreddit for classic
---
ur are facing actual dogshit palas then, if you dont kill em in a stun, which if they are half plate, you wont, they stun you and do 4k burst in the stun. sadly i am on mograine eu.
---
I'm level 48 questing just fine
---
They're definitely not all consistent, but there are examples such as the Tanaan Invasion WoD introduction at the end where you're running to the docks to escape the Iron Horde. Smaller quests such as escorting Khadgar in a few locations in Legion also did it, but there aren't a ton of escort quests nowadays that truly make you follow an NPC through a town so yea the couple of cases there are usually end up being borky like what you described
---
90% of warlocks don’t run around with void
---
Hunter pets have dynamic movement speed. They absolutely could have done it
---
^^^^^^^^^^  Most of the people claiming to be a GM literally lead a guild of ragtag misfits they started themselves, organized nothing, and it either fell apart super fast or never amounted to anything special. 
---
Their guild wasn't memorable and most of the members probably forgot about being in it.
---
I get it for pugs though - usually people trying to save time. this is what GUILDS are for.   
---
if you are 58-59 and your 60 guildies are locking you out - time to find a new guild.
---
or wotf
---
I'll drink to that
---
if classic goes to shit, i either go back to Pservers or play other games...why the hell would i play retail Wow in place of classic?
---
It’s horrible. I’m a lvl 56 priest. I’ve died more since Thursday since the entire 1-56. And I’ve only gotten ~20% exp since then. Had to respec holy/disc and plan on just dungeon grinding the rest. 
---
Adding HKs without BGs was like french frying when you’re supposed to pizza, it’s a bad time.
---
Because PvP isn’t always 1v1...
---
I want to, but first we must be sure the little fucktard is using or not the addons.
---
Blizzard never added guards into quest givers... just look at STV hunter's camp. Zero guards despite it being a huge skeleton field most of the time. They added these buff instant death guards into hubs near 40 man raids.
---
I'm on a Horde dominated side.
---
I played Vanilla before BG's. PVP was never this crazy, because there were never this many people per server.
---
Period. Your comments are both toxic and just plain wrong.
---
Anyone who ever played a PVP realm from Vanilla through BFA was never subjected to this level of onslaught from one side.
---
It's completely new territory due to the faction imbalances (which have always existed on some servers) but more importantly due to the massive server population caps (which never existed on Vanilla servers). The game map is simply too small to accomodate this many people trying to do stuff. It was not *designed* with this many people per-square foot in mind.
---
People's complaint is this isn't anything like it was in Vanilla.  I didn't roll pvp because I knew this is exactly how it would play out and I just don't have the time for it anymore.
---
What happens when you land?
---
Blaumeux, for everyone wondering.
---
Sure you can blame the players for creating this imbalance but Blizzard could have helped mitigate the problem by introducing some sort of balancing mechanism.
---
You can indirectly track some addons like Details! since it talks to other people's Details! to provide talent tree info, but aside from that there is no possible way to check all addons someone has installed.
---
Agreed, progressing together like that is great. This is how my guild started off, we kept progressing with 20-25 people, no pugs, managed to kill Baron with 20 people which felt really good because most of us were first timers and undergeared, so it took a few tries to figure out the safest strategy. Last saturday we downed 9/10 with no wipes, was too late for Rag so tried to kill him yesterday. Unfortunately, someone popped the Onyxia buff when we were killing her ourselves, so we missed out on it (6h cooldown) and wiped on Rag at 9% (30 people), so I'm pretty sure it would've been a kill with Ony buff. He's going down next week.
---
I’ve never been a GM
---
I’ve never been a RL
---
I have, however, spent a fuckton of DKP and lived through the drama!
---
I know how code works, and we're not just talking about a few escort NPCs here, so making something that can work with all of them would have been better and should have been done. It's not as simple as going from point a to point b at a fixed speed, but it's not hard either. Each escort NPC didn't re-invent walking between points, so they share code already as it is.
---
And they always make sure to announce it to everyone so that we can all know how cool they are.
---
This is a laughably bad argument, and it is sad that standing around at lights hope as people fly in and die makes you feel superior at PVP.  
---
BTW, a 66/33 server population is 2:1.  Think about that.  When was the last time you won a fight 2 vs. 1?  60/40 is 3 : 2.  Do you win many 3 on 2 fights?
---
If you've got a way to quickly add up the value of everything you loot, which can be quite a lot if you're doing, for example, a full strat run, then this is a good idea!
---
Otherwise, it's just too much work for me to do.
---
Do you have issues with mobs resisting your shadow spells.   My shadow priest runs into it all the time even with mobs several levels below.  It'll be like Mind blast resist, mind flay resist, mind flay hit, Mind blast resist.  I can understand a higher level mob but when they are lower it's crazy.
---
Bottom image instantly reminded me of [this].(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LDommzVgUc)
---
It was pretty obvious dude
---
Unpopular opinion, I rolled on a PvE server this time around (played on Mal'Ganis, a PvP server, in vanilla) and I love how many more people there are.  It makes finding a dungeon *so much* easier, Ulda still isn't hugely popular now but I can actually find a group for it compared to vanilla.
---
'should' being the keyword here.
---
haha ahh im so alone
---
Can't wait til that shitstorm starts.
---
No pug will survive Naxx or even AQ40, you are clearly an idiot who has done neither. Go back to retail, you won’t be missed.
---
Yes that is a problem. I never understood why anyone would do that... but then people do that today too they just go to STV or some other place. Then for each of these guys, there is usually a counter ganker that relieves the low levers.
---
Its most likely a number that resembles what happened to runescape when they did their version of "classic".
---
Honor per hour cross faction doesn't matter. You're only competing against your own faction for pvp ranks.
---
I would just use ItemRack.
---
not sure if you want, but itemrack (addon)  will allow you set all these things? 
---
but if you are set on using a macro ring/trinket slots are  11 12 (fingers) 13 14 (trinkets)
---
And players 12 or more levels lower than yours.
---
and to wait on your cooldowns :)
---
I can see that your clowness never been to gadgetzan.  It's an extremely popular location for level 60 to port to
---
What are the queues like?
---
Just renew the mages, easy.
---
no one has pvp gear yet
---
Server is closer to 40/60 than 50/50.  But ya, you don't understand words.  This is literally world PvP.  You just don't like it, which is fine.  Cry more.
---
When they rez they are worth honor...
---
Bumping this thread as I'm trying this myself.
---
Are Anticipation and Toughness any good?
---
If so, which is better when?
---
For some reason Tinkerwiz and Oglethorpe won’t offer me the quest for Gnomish Engineering. I have 225/300 engineering and I haven’t specialized in anything. I submitted a ticket and a GM referred me to WoW head.
---
I’m thinking more about Gadgetzan and Everlook which are goblin towns. Whereas Hunters camp is exactly that, a camp. Not a city. City guards make a lot of sense.
---
Ban all raid addons. If you can’t play without training wheels, then you shouldn’t be there.
---
You get diminishing honor each time you get an HK on the same person. Up to 4 kills a day
---
Imagine standing up for / defending a streamer in a wow classic subreddit, with less than 30 or so comments.
---
You sure showed us all, and I'm sure this Pshero guy made a mental note that Kolaru is a TRUE fan, and stood up for him!
---
You got us all, m8! We won't have opinions of our own anymore, thanks to your dedicated work!
---
Some people just dont enjoy the fun gameplay that is being stunned for 8 seconds by a rogue as a clothie
---
That's what I miss about EVE PvP in Lowsec.  After a good fight win or lose you would probably have a conversation with your opponent discussing what worked and what didn't.
---
I always said the nicest people in EVE are the ones trying to kill you.
---
This hit me in the feels. In 37, 4 kids and house destroyed.

Free Hong Kong
---
This might be true for balanced servers only. 
---
On unbalanced servers, the dominating faction will continue to gank everybody and their mother while waiting in the queue for the next BG. While the undog faction will have instant BGs and no incentive at all to leave town and come to aid their faction comrads who are getting slaughtered in the wild. 
---
So IMHO, when's BGs open up, the shit show will get even worse on unbalanced servers.
---
To be honest people who kill you upon landing are dumb as F and don't understand pvp honor lol. Supposed to Sap/sheep/whatever you can to keep from them moving for 30 seconds until they turn into an honorable kill lol.
---
the multi boxer is also a guild member, aside from super hardcore fights a multi boxer can preform fine.

not yet you cant

"If you don't like being roughly ass fucked why did you opt in to occasionally be roughly ass fucked?"
---
Was gonna say I've seen a lot of pictures from Blizzcon that fit the stereotype. Still wanna go one time, though.
---
Or we could add on his idea and have it be that when a gray player attacked someone much higher level they would no longer be gray, and they could be killed without the dishonorable repercussions.
---
Dude give it a rest
---
Maraudon death runs are a little harder to navigate when purple/orange isn't obvious.
---
TBH I think I'd be OK with banning DBM too. It made PvE too easy &amp; boring.
---
Without being rude, as a warlock of subpar skill, I have yet to die to a warrior in 1v1. I feel almost certain I could 2v1 two warriors at my skill level (this is my first warlock, I got HOTA with a spriest, same thing) Your only way to live, imo is to resist my death coil or first fear out of death coil, but even that would be tough. I guess maybe if i had death coil down and was low mana. I'm sorry, bro. My husband is a warrior, I get it. Feel good knowing everyone will want a warrior flag carrier in WSG!
---
As an Alliance mage, on Atiesh, who spends a lot of time in the beautiful landscape that is Hillsbrad, I'll be sure to look up next time we visit your barn :)
---
on that note, you guys are absolute troopers out there. We've been having a blast the last couple days, we hope you guys have to.
---
The one from Heartglen is funny.
---
Hold up!
---
 *mounts a big ass horse*
---
Still walks slow af.
---
Same. I got the leaf a little over a week before honor hit and I knew I *had* to get the demons killed before last Thursday. Even then, there was a group of Alliance that griefed me on Klinfran.
---
Hey let's not make fun of people in full MC gear... Us druids didn't choose to be the only one in the raid! :P
---
What do you think the horde will be doing during their 45 minute wait to get into WSG?
---
Such a place exists?? /s
---
Love me my PvE experience
---
Not just a healer, you also need someone cleaning debuffs off you nonstop.  If you have this, then you'll be OK and really mess some people up.  If you don't have this, you'll have a bad time.
---
I'll just ask exactly what I said again then, how would preventing the combat log from **seeing enemy players gaining buffs until they're within a certain radius of you** break any of those things you mentioned? They don't need to remove the combat log, they don't need to prevent you from seeing the damage done or healing done of people, Spy could still function by seeing when someone nearby uses an ability. All they have to do to seriously nerf the addon is to stop it from instantly seeing when a player enters their view distance because of "X gained Ice Armor", which appears even if they already had ice armor before entering your view distance.
---
Details!, DBM, and WarcraftLogs will be fine, in fact all 3 of those examples rarely get used in PvP anyways, so how would this break them in any way?
---
That is not what he is suggesting.
---
On point.
---
Or maybe some classes are extremelly overpowered in 1v1s and facing them is not really an option
---
&gt; No. That’s literally just PvP happening.
---
If "PvP happening" is being unable to go literally anywhere or achieve literally anything because there are 5 times the opposing players, then "PvP happening" is fucking stupid. 
---
&gt; Absolutely did. 
---
Yes, more concurrent subs but not half the current population per server. According to Blizzard themselves, low pop servers now have more concurrent online than peak servers in vanilla. There are just too many people per zone, which is a problem in a number of ways.
---
You would have to change how the game works entirely. I can target things through walls, so the combat log considers it within line of sight.
---
Oh my bad, sorry that I typed out my reasons for why the current phase is interesting instead of just whining about my PVP server getting invaded by PVP. 
---
But right, everyone who disagrees with you is just "fragile".
---
You actually are a clown. Stop attacking a strawman you made yourself.
---
All the better to have less players to compete with.
---
It's not like playing on another server deletes their toons. If someone isn't having fun playing on a pvp server now, why should they keep playing on it? Making an alt on pve server for when someone is frustrated with pvp seems like a good call for someone who is frustrated with pvp.
---
Yes he kept changing it back to the same thing
---
This isn't necessarily correct. 
---
I'm heart of the wild/NS and Int is my primary healing stat as a fresh 60.  Gradually yeah we want +spi and +heal but int is boosted 20% and most fights outside of raids are over before you go OOM.  So a lot of heal druids absolutely need int, especially while leveling.
---
Trinkets are one of the low tier rewards for honor.  Those will be out very shortly.
---
It's really the only answer. Imho.  It solves peak hour imbalances, makes for better and less biased game play for everyone involved and puts pressure on the faction that is causing the high queue times to begin with to change servers.
---
I mean, last night after a 1.5 hour login wait. I logged in, got a group for BRD, flew to Red Ridge because Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes flight paths were being camped by literal raid groups.  It took me 12 deaths and 50 minutes to get from Red Ridge into BRD.
---
12 deaths and almost an hour, to cross one zone.
---
After waiting an hour and a half just to log in.
---
I
---
Horde ganks when at less than 15 percent health or in a group. Other than that they run away. If I could pvp a lvl 60 as a lvl 48 warrior I would ateast attempt to defend myself. Just stand and die I guess.
---
Spy is the only thing that gives me a chance against rogues and druids
---
Ughhh people who try to do that jump in pugs are idiots. 
---
If your group is all familiar with the skip its fine, but teaching 4 people how to do it is not faster than just clearing all the packs lol
---
PVE server: Going to farm elementals in EPL... there's someone from the enemy faction farming there. You just kind of have to compete in mobs.
---
PVP server: Engage with the enemy faction and kill them securing some valuable time to farm efficiently.
---
PVE server: Questing with a group of friends and you walk across a group of the opposite faction stealing your mobs. Emote at them but have no choice other than to just try to compete to tag mobs first.
---
PVP server: Engage in a group v group battle that ends with one side getting control of that area. The other has to move on.
---
You act like pvp servers have no impact on pve. What the people above you are describing is they enjoy organic pvp that happens in the world, but do not enjoy this new phase of honor farming, which takes an organic experience and makes it forced the majority of the time. Don't even get me started on world bosses in pve servers. They hardly even make sense.
---
Let's take my experience in an established server late in Vanilla as an example.  As a 60 you could farm, and you had to farm to keep up raid consumables. Because the honor system had been released for so long (and battlegrounds were released), the extreme hype of world pvp "honor farming" had died down, I could farm pretty efficiently while mostly encountering things I described above. In Classic you will just be farmed and killed almost immediately in any 50+ zone.
---
So maybe your advice to these people that aren't enjoying this part should be to wait it out. This is a lot of initial hype over the ranking system and WILL die down over time. No established Vanilla server well into it's lifespan was like this. Was there ganking? Yes. Were there squads of people killing? Yes, but they were not at the frequency we see now. Stop pretending you don't understand their complaints just because you disagree with them.
---
Yours Truly,
---
Someone that is enjoying this phase, but isn't an ass.
---
For some reason I made friends with the ret pallies in my guild, some of the most fun we have is 4 ret pallies and me (a priest). None of them have prot talents but we do fine and have a lot of fun
---
because you don't hang out with nerds in game
---
Why are you talking out of your ass? Server merges existed in vanilla.
---
Grass is always greener huh
---
But it wouldnt properly display due to the bug. I mained druid in vanilla and you most certainly couldn't be mana burned in form.
---
Absolutely. People that are wpvp nuts all gushed about the honor system in hopes that you'd either have these epic 20+ raid groups battling in an area or you have some epic 1v1 ganking battle. The truth is that it's all just devolved to grimey 2-5 v 1 mass hunting and corpse camping, so the people not in a killsquad are just getting fucked.
---
Why are you whining at us? Nobody here can make changes to the game.
---
I think this happens when you load an Alliance character.
---
And that's why small sample sizes are unreliable, it always drops for my guild instead of the eye
---
Is there a Priest (non shadow) BiS list for PVP?
---
I understand you :D I workout too
---
&gt; Yes. World pvp is pretty stupid. 
---
I can handle all world PvP I ever experienced in vanilla from launch  to TBC because the player numbers meant you were never really against organized raids even in high level zones. Ganksquads, when they happened, were groups of 3-5 guys roaming around you could usually counter. I have never experienced anything like what Alliance on some servers are experiencing now, which is the legitimate inability due to raids and Spy to go to any single max level zone without being killed.
---
&gt; You’re taking that quote completely out of context. They sad that in regard to Retail and it’s population ratings on the login page.
---
No, I guess you just missed their statement on the subject:
---
&gt; [Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835)
---
It should frankly be obvious to anyone playing right now that high pop server populations are massive compared to vanilla. Some of the 200v200 fights in classic would melt a vanilla area.
---
Don't let one bad druid spoil the class for you. Druids are so clutch in 5 mans. I've tanked, healed, and cat dps'd my way to 60 often switching mid run. A decent car dps should be popping out to brez or innervate, and add to the AOE with hurricane when needed. Mob heading to the healer and the tank is slow to react? Pop bear form, charge and bash(stun) while tank makes his way over. Unfortunatelt at 60 its a bit different as in raids it really does seem to be rough on the druids
---
I mean, so much about Vanilla was already known going into it and with Twitch and all that, there's such an urge to play for efficiency rather than fun.
---
Yeah its an additional 10% off. From what I heard, if you have been pvping nonstop you can get rank 3 in 1 week. If you pvp for a few hours every day you can get rank 3 in 3 weeks. 
---
That's just what I've heard, so we'll see how it shakes out. I went ahead and bought my epic mount 2 days ago cuz I ain't got time for that shit!
---
Seriously use the lukewarm noodles you call a brain and THINK what’s different between being on a pvp server right now in classic vs in TBC
---
“But you couldn’t fly in Azeroth in tbc either!” 
---
L

O
---
How’s it feel to be a whiny little bitch
---
if you think it ain't then you need your head checked.
---
This mandem must be immune to *ganking*
---
Numbers are from https://ironforge.pro/servers/
---
derived from raid logs so it should give a good basis of the lvl60 raiding population.
---
It doesn't matter why. You can choose to have fun(even if that means playing a different game) or you can choose to be miserable and complain. It seems pretty obvious which one you've chosen.
---
Is his name Asmongold?

*Waaaaahhh! Stop trying to change my gaaaammmee!!!*

Lol, jesus, get a grip.

Homie could have said nothing arms got 70g. That's greedy homie. 5g for for 2 sets of water a teleport and time with multiple messages asking if it was a mistake. C'mon now, even the nice guys are "greedy" smh. U just mad your not a mage and broke.

Correct.  2004/2005 WoW message boards were filled with Alliance raging about how broken the Horde racials were.  Also, Shamans countered the ever living fudge out of Paladins.
---
The counter-whine from the Horde was "But Paladins can bubble hearth!"  Yes...
---
You left out gear changes. Players are hitting each other now for a fuckload more damage than they were in vanilla.
---
Ohh, got it. Thanks for the info.
---
Yep it can. When you get in range of another player with a passive, class specific buff, it logs it. So if there was a hunter sitting afk behind a tree with aspect of the hawk on, it would show up on your spy when you got near him because he would gain aspect of the hawk buff in your combat log.
---
Crossrealm BGs ... nuff said
---
Not as technical, but... I was recently recommended to check out 'Countdown to Classic', it's a podcast. The important detail: there's a frequent guest named Kevin Jordan. Kevin Jordan is \[one of\] the main class + talent + ability designer for Vanilla. Kevin is so intimately knowledgeable about the class design and all those details.
---
Skim some of the Countdown to Classic episode summaries and I have no doubt you'll find some episodes about technical architecture. The podcast is on Spotify which makes it really handy. Cheers!
---
You're not wrong, but at the same time, you're so wrong.
---
Alliance have the pvp racial "paladins" which is better than both wotf and hardiness, but you have to party up correctly to use it.
---
Ya trying to fix this is a massive undertaking and often people here think it's a simple change. Personally as someone who doesn't think it's a problem lowering combat log range to something like 70 yards is a good starting point. Some combination of max range attack and max range heal.
---
Simple fix here. 
---
What's the max view distance to where things load in, NPCs, players, etc? Set the combat log viewing distance to that.
---
No changes is stupid. This game doesn't even come close to vanilla, and it will die just like retail did if no changes will be made.
---
Is it worth transferring my Alli mage off Golemagg? (EU)
---
Bags do fill up pretty quick, I would guess you can squeeze in 6 runs max with totally empty bags. You can prioritize greens and the boss drops over grey armor drops since they aren't worth alot at that level if you wanna hold off heading back as long as possible I guess. I just go until my bags are full and head back.  Turning silk into heavy silk bandages to vendor will help conserve some space too
---
It’s evil, I love it!
---
&gt; Clearing Scholo can take x2 as long with the amount of extra clearing you have to do. Assuming they play flawlessly.
---
What pulls can you skip in Scholo with 60s that you have to pull with a 58? Or 56?
---
Yea, with these small realms the queues will surely be 1 hour long
---
Thanks for the info. I'll check it out.
---
All my friends that have never played WoW reached max level and full pre bis in less than 15 days /played. Like what..
---
I did. Horde were always QQing about how AV was biased towards Alliance in its design, don't you remember?
---
Right?? Heaven forbid we actually enjoy what the story, the quests, the globetrotting, the dungeons, and the raids enough to be satisfied
---
Lol, you cant just take an entire category of abilities off the table for pvp and say that's a solution. Area skills are part of large-scale pvp.
---
Dropout rate still holds true, just more people were intrested than they expected. We went from 8+ layers and 15-20k queues on ~70% of available realms down to 1 layer and 2-3k queues on 10% of realms. Dunno how can you take out of this 50% dropout rate.
---
Finally a pvp video I can relate to
---
Having the choice takes away from the immersion is what I'm saying. It's land contested by factions at war, I think PvP should be on on in those areas by default. I'm honestly okay with the way things are, just explaining my reasoning for choosing PvP.
---
I don't think that means what you think it means...
---
There's a large difference between feeling that the world is dangerous, and being farmed when you're trying to get from point a to b. Last night I died 12 times trying to get to brd from thorium point. It feels like I'm wasting time, because there's no way I have a fighting chance against raids.
---
If it was originally a broken game then now it's a broken mess.  Sure I wouldn't trust Ian Hasastickinmyass after what happened to BFA, but Classic needed some changes, and this is showing it.
---
Agreed.  Honestly the classic experience would be better if most/all of the add ons were removed.
---
Gonna download this now, thanks!
---
Jesus dude, download excel or something, trello sounds like a mess to manage SK.
---
You could prob use monolith DKP; it may or may not have a direct SK plugin but at worst you could just make players bid DKP equal to current DKP to get an item worst-case.

This was something I predicted personally from the beginning. Everybody *thinks* they love wPVP, but the truth is that wPvP just kinda sucks and isn't really fun unless you're on a squad outnumbering people. I have not had a single experience before or after the patch where there was an even numbered battle. It's always one side 2v1 and they pretty much always win. They either move on or be those guys that corpse camp. That's all that wPvP is 98% of the time.

He's talking about "omg why did you spam Flash of Light (Rank 6) there instead of doing Divine Favor Holy Light (Rank 9)? Noob Paladin."
---
How many of copy paste tread we need to read?
---
I think he's more of a morning elf, actually.
---
Stop being lazy and fix my problems!!!
---
Not played much this week, but Southshore vs Tarren Mill was booming on Mirage Raceway a few days ago.
---
PvE gets a pretty unearned rep for not featuring PvP, which is demonstrably false. Come P3 many are already planning to live in BGs. You can still play exclusively PvP on a PvE realm at max level, and avoid most of the griefing in the process.
---
Balance NS serves to be a servicable healer in group PvP while being able to put out damage and being amazing in 1v1. Not to mention several variations of it being the go-to PvE raid spec as well.
---
It's out of the ass number, but still realistic. We went from 8+ layers, 15k+ queues on majority of realms down to 1 layer and just couple of realms having queues.
---
 **Yes I'm a gearmaxxed level 60 Horde (mage)** 
---
Yes its always fun for the dominant faction lol. The problem is that this isn't wow vanilla, its **WoW CLASSIC,** players became a lot more fucked up in the head, world pvp went up their head.
---
You can totally hang on to your pet tamed at lvl 10. However, some pet moves can only be learned from specific beasts. Check petopia for all the deets. For example, the only way to get max rank Bite is by taking one of the LBRS wolves.
---
War.... War never changinggggg

Every mormon males dream.

Full of dimples? haha! I think you mean "full of pimples". "dimples" are an attractive attribute. "pimples" are not. If you dont know the difference, you should probably google the definition of "dimple".

Thank you for taking the time to read our post and we look forward to meeting you!
---
The game is actually a total piece of shit and i hate it. Let me guess you are horde and/or not constantly outnumbered at all times? Takes fewer than 5 deaths to reach BRD? This game is garbage delete it please.
---
&gt; when you choose to roll on a PvP server, you shouldn't whine about PvP.
---
What? That doesn't make any sense.
---
If you choose to play WoW, you forbid the right to complain about WoW. If you choose to read on Reddit, you forbid the right to complain about a Redditor to a mod (lmao).
---
The logic doesn't add up. I'm sorry this is incoherent to you.
---
Why are you going in MC alone ? You should always go with your raid group.
---
u just get kicked to character selection screen right? so you can log back in right away?
---
They told you wrong, bro. Get in there and slam that shit. Two more levels and you can start sneaking into some brd arena/angerforge farming runs
---
AV? I thought we were talking about PvP.
---
Got any of those free bags for a reroller on Westfall (Alliance)? Just asking... For a friend.
---
I hope you will read your own comment in a few years, to see if your perspective has broadened beyond thinking that factions and the people playing are actually different from eachother outside of racials and classes available.
---
You gave in to peer pressure, you only have yourself to blame. Should have gone with your gut and rolled horde instead of following Beavis to the alliance.
---
Nope. Lower level players just don't give honor:
---
[The dishonor system has been implemented. If a player kills a passive opposite faction NPC labeled civilian, then he or she will receive a dishonorable kill. The dishonorable kill immediately lowers how close you are to the next rank. If a player attacks a player on the opposite faction whose level is 10 or more levels below his or her own, then he or she will not receive any contribution points for that honor kill.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0))

*Ret is perfectly viable, play what you think is fun*
---
All I have is a shit fury warrior who tops out meters and can tank 5 mans.  Going Arms on weekends to wreck BGs will be a nice change of pace. /s
---
People said this about classic and I still had a 2 hour queue to login last night.
---
I think the thing is, many of the people that would transfer may just quit anyway. You either lose them as a customer and on the server. Or just the server.
---
You are a legend my friend, thank you!  I used to use Reagent Restocker way back, loved how it would grab light feathers from the bank and restock all my portal runes, and by fixing this you have given me the exact functionality I was looking for.
---
no, it was and will be playerS versus recently spawned player. they’re just doing it to keep me from instancing and playing the game. i’m worth ZERO honor after the fifth death and fourth spawn kill. you’d think i would have solace, since i’m worth nothing to them at that point, but they still kill when nothing is gained.
---
I farm in the very north of westernplaguelands in this human city. Sometimes there are 60s who want to make that escort quest, so they always leave me alone but sometimes i kill them to fuck up their quest but only before i log out. I know iam a good boy :)
---
&gt;	you can dual wield spellblades
---
Oh god 🙄
---
Haha I respectfully disagree
---
*laughs in blacksmithing keys*
---
Amen.
---
What class is the natural predator for a Hunter around 30-35 zone?
---
eg: classes I should avoid and unwinnable fights
---
None of these applied to me until I hit the very end. But as a warrior, I need beer to have something to sip while I wait for healer so I don’t feel left out.
---
Last Tuesday out AH was sold out of Essence of Water.  Next day I check and somebody had put a whole bunch more up for the same 18G they normally are.
---
So? This was just an example of the only people in hillsbrand not being noobs, using noobs in raids. My statement was pretty crystal clear. Anyone farming honor in a raid in hillsbrand is a noob. Maybe try activating your brain and reread the chain you replied to, otherwise i'll not give a fuck to continue replying.
---
Ive said it in game and keep reading it but a lot of people seem to need BoE bind on equips and greed and BoP bind on pickups. Idk, its like once its more than 20g everyones like "k everyone need" and im the "idiot" that spammed greed quickly because i cant use the item. Idk, several times ive lost out because i greeded and "everyone knows to need these types of items" and im just like K lesson learned. Now i greed/need last lol
---
No. Hell no. No changes. 
---
You want realm specific battlegrounds? You're also going to want mass ganking from the faction that has to wait in queue. Because guess what happens when players can't go in bgs. Theyll gank lowbies. I will never switch to play alliance, fuck them. Nothing you do will ever make me switch or transfer. 
---
Secondly, you allow premades to stomp on everyone in bgs without opposition. At least cross realm, the system can priority match players based on rank or group size to make it worth a fight. If you ever played on ND you would know how terrible realm specific battle grounds are
---
Actually it was and I loved it. I sometimes camped Arathi or Stranglethorn with my 60 rogue just to grief the lowbies.
---
Little bit of column A, little bit of column B. Blizzard wants a cut, people want a safer way to buy, blizzard wants happier customers. Blizzard wants to spend less money on recovering hacked accounts. Blizzard wants to spend less money on shutting down gold sellers.
---
&gt; What an amazing apologism for microtransactions in general.
---
Noting your scarcasm, I don't think I'm apologizing for microtransactions in general. Blizzard isn't creating artificial scarcity on the gold so that they can fabricate it and sell it to you. Rather, someone else spent time laboring for that gold, and you're paying them for their labor.
---
It's a really weird gradient. Do you allow players to gift other players with money, or buy labor? Are you allowed to pay tanks to tank for you in instances? Can a friend loan you gold on the good will between the two of you? Can a friend give you gold after you buy them lunch? Can a friend of a friend give you gold after you buy *them* lunch? Can someone you've never met give you gold if you paypal them money for lunch?
---
I get that blizzard explicitly has rules against spending IRL money on in-game money, and in that light, the questions are easily answered. I think the world is a little grayer than that though ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Also horde racial bonuses are considered better.
---
I pretty much agree with everything you say.  I think WSG will bring a lot of people in but AV will be the more casual-friendly BG.  I personally detest classic WSG, there's no timer so turtling can make games last forever.  I actually wonder how AV will play out since the zerg race to the boss will still be a viable strategy.
---
that is a shame, but it is a long way to re-roll.  i wish blizz had done a better job at balancing faction from the get go.  the launch was a disaster.
---
maybe the only solution is faction transfers within a server.
---
i can't find anything :(
---
My favorite trick is to distract people off the BRM chain into lava. Well it used to, now with honor point it dosent pay :(
---
Hard agree.
---
Dungeom grinding, zf is good till 52.
---
Ye found my treasure! I’ll be takin’ it back boy-o.
---
I'm kinda happy the screaming over boss kills isn't happening with us. Nothing screams "fake" more than having to press a PTT key to scream with joy.
---
&gt; The other guy got it slightly wrong, it does detect active stealth.
---
No my friend, you're the wrong one here.  Spy can only detect when stealth activates, and only if the player does it within your combat log's range.  If the Rogue is stealthed from miles away and then stealth-walks up to you and ganks you, your Spy will never go off until they're smashing you.
---
I am facing what you're facing, this is the hardest quest in the entire game you'd be upset to be doing good on the fight and getting raped, then being corpse camped for the next half hour so the thing despawns nd you have to wait another 2 fucking hours for it to spawn. I'm not complaining about faction imbalance i'm trying to vent my frustrations and see how other people are dealing with this quest in Phase 2... Your comment sounds like you're a racist.
---
Cookie is in the Deadlines which is a long swim from Grom Gol, actually.
---
Made it to 58 on my warrior tank, quit last night. Impatient dps boil my blood.
---
I knew 2 dudes back in highschool that were the perfect stereotype of nerd that you'd think plays Magic the gathering.
---
Aside from that I met my now ex gf playing WoW, her brother was a semi-pro hockey player, my cousin was a car mechanic and also had a neighbor that co-owned an electrician company. My mom also played a Tauren druid from 1-15.
---
It's the mass griefing and mass organized corpse camping  that's getting to people, I think. 
---
PvP doesn't mean every last shred of sportsmanship needs to fly out the window 24/7 because honor farming has been enabled.
---
Yes, we are talking about BGs. AV is one of them, remember?
---
I can type more slowly, if you think it will help you understand better.
---
Don't forget the part where blizzard honey dicks everyone with false promises and fancy trailers. Once classic fades,  so does my interest in blizzard.
---
People are whiny.  I'm playing alliance on a very horse dominated server, I'm sure its like 70/30 if not VERY close to it.
---
I play a hpala and having a blast ganking with one to two friends. Most of the time we run into bigger groups than us, but we still somehow come out on top. By now I have like 55k honor.
---
We do also get fucked and corpse camped by huge groups, but it's part of the game and I just get annoyed when people cry over this.
---
I met a lot of people that attacked same level people in my server. I even had a couple fights that were good and the loser re-spawned mana'd up and we engaged again. I've attacked most classes 1v1 because I wanted to see what my class can handle. Now that I know I can't kill locks/spriests I won't engage them unless I have an advantage because the class matchup isn't "fair" even though it's 1v1.
---
yeah trying to quest in epl/wpl right now is just asking to get gang-ganked
---
I believe it's a little less, especially if you spec for improved feign (2% less chance to resist). It's just infuriating when you spend 10+ mins clearing and the one mob resists your feign - insta corpse walk and there's nothing you can do about it
---
It is morals if you expect everyone to play in equal sized pvp battles. You are projecting your morals and will be disappointed
---
Not even close, you sure you know what that means?
---
Thanks man. Shits rough but words like these help.
---
As long as it brings them back to Org when they are done it's an improvement. 
---
But you are right. It's not going to solve the issues people are having.
---
Nah, they changed it back to 25% for classic compared to 10% in 1.12
---
Saw someone link the blue post somewhere
---
Ehhh you can still die within 4 seconds to an alliance rogue w/ thistle tea and cold blood or 10 seconds but with kidney shot included.
---
Because they are better for PvP excepting gnomes' escape artist which is amazing in Bgs.
---
Was class leader and co-raid leader in Vanilla and BC. However, I’ve switched classes and the last thing I want is to EVER RL again. Hell, my new main is 45 and I barely run instances.
---
Bloodrazor or Thrash Blade at lvl 45?
---
Literally me!!
---
Yes, of course there is no lag here because as I said, there is like two raids max, **about 60 people. Dustwallow marsh is a low level zone.** No shit it's not gonna lag, genius.  
---
You didn't answer my questions, I take it that you're genuinely not playing the game and just talking shit. If you went just once to a level 60 zone, you wouldn't be bootlicking.
---
How are people supposed to know what population balance would look like?  
---
Damn those kids for not being able to see the future!
---
I'm a 60 tank, but I find often sometimes a smoother run with ppl 57-59 b/c they try much harder during the run than the average 60.
---
Also back then people thought paladins where INSANE for just having a full immunity bubble
---
&gt; But they also posted this, which seems false, but which contradicts your statement.
---
It doesn't contradict it.. They are saying they could fit a lot more people to reduce queues, but don't. They are also saying the servers contain far more people than they used to. That is not mutually exclusive. 
---
If a vanilla server had 10.000 and current servers have 20.000, they are saying they COULD have 30.000 and no queues but that they don't want that. 
---
&gt; So. No. It wouldn’t be frankly obvious to anyone that rolled on a calmer server, intentionally, like I did.
---
That a good balance exists on lower population servers doesn't change anything. Players shouldn't be punished for playing on high pop PvP servers by not being able to play the game.
---
unsub until bgs :(
---
Shoulda played on a PVE server I guess.
---
This depends on how you mean hard?
---
Top two is going to be Four Horsemen and then KT.  After that the definition matters.  Raw complexity can make some like Gothik up there, or Cthun.  Thaddius had a relative gear check as well as a raids ability to never have anyone fuck up.  Loatheb WOULD have been incredibly difficult if people wouldn't shadow pot through it.  Ouro was an awful fight because I still don't understand what determines whether he submerges or not.  If he doesn't submerge everytimer then it's easy, but if he does, then the fight is difficult.  Something like Viscidus is one of the worst designed fights in the game, but also incredibly difficult. Patchwerk is a difficult fight unless you outgear it, then it is kind of easy.
---
assuming you include difficulty at the time of release, Vael was difficult because of the timer you had limiting your ability to get in attempts.
---
Thank you so much, this is exactly what I've been looking for! Lvl 54 druid now, def about to respec to this and start grinding my preraid bis!
---
As a shadow priest this is my problem. I have major mana issues that stem simply from being a shadow priest and I basically "need" that demonic/dark rune in order to stay in the fight. THankfully my WoW buddy ive played with for 15 years has ALWAYS been a warlock, so im pretty used to using them. More often than not though, i'll use DR CD instead of HS :(
---
Yeah man i sure do love those fair fights where I get feared for 10 seconds straight and die to dots. Lots of skill involved.
---
Healcomm is just an addon that shows incoming heals and can be used with any other frame.
---
That's a good point!  Thanks for the WoWpop link, I hadn't seen that before.
---
You mentioned that a plethora of times in your video. No one besides this guy is thinking this.
---
&gt;PvP doesn't mean every last shred of sportsmanship needs to fly out the window 24/7 because honor farming has been enabled.
---
For the people aiming for r14,  it literally does mean that.
---
Wack
---
Yep and now I will be punished for picking horde on a PVE server because I will still have long queues because of these idiots.
---
Theres multiple things but I truly believe it can be mostly blamed on blood elves. No matter what, aesthetics is probably one of the most important things, its why xmog is a thing, same with the haircut additions. It totally is a pretty vs ugly races thing.  
---
The reason why people now play horde is familiarity. Racials are cool but since most people cite the UD wotf as a motivating factor, its clear that they are just parroting what theyve read especially since the "best racial" for a warrior, for example, is *easily* escape artist and not wotf.  
---
Also horde has shaman which brings WF along with it, which is pretty absurd not to have on alliance.
---
that's what you took out of that post? lol
---
This is the kind of guy who pulls apart live ants.
---
I enjoy the crazy PvP right now,  and I'm only level 45. I have the day off work tomorrow,  and will be waking up and grinding at 7 AM onwards to avoid the after-work madness in the evening. It's not unplayable, like many are claiming.  Be smarter, play at different times than the masses.
---
Threatmeter is super important on fights like Ony. During phase 1 and 3, she knocks the tank back and he loses about 30% of his threat. If you are more than 60%, you have a high chance of pulling agro and wiping the raid.
---
He probably thinks you sound boring to play with. Let him enjoy the game how he wants to.
---
My personal favourite comments over there are the people replying to comments from 2007 with shit like "this isnt until p5 bro" or "this wasnt in classic"
---
They said they weren’t going to but I hope they change their mind about that one.
---
fair enough but it's pretty easy to avoid those civilian DKs if your solo. not too complicated to not CL right next to the only two relevant NPCs
---
That is correct, you miss out if you interfere when 2 people are fighting (assuming you intend to kill the enemy guy more times)
---
The pet name really got me
---
This 100%. I couldnt play after work due to the queue at launch. When transfers opened up i left faerlina to heartseeker. Never regretted it once. I never deal qwith waiting in queue and im enjoying every second i play. Peoppe need to transfer.
---
Last night on the boats a horde raid of 30 people would hide below deck and when the boat leaves comes up and kills everyone. We load to the next map and die all over again. 2nd night in a row. No alliance wants to go fight them.
---
Just dinged 51 today and deadlifted 485 lbs for 1 rep. I am still enjoying my free time without kids by playing WoW and lifting weights. The kids will come in about two years and I am scared that all of this will end.
---
The trick with DM is to never think you’ll make it, and focusing on just maximizing death run distance. Sometimes you shouldn’t mount up, just running will get you further.
---
There are more reasons to dislike spy than being an advocate of unfair matches.
---
Literally as soon as I stepped into Redridge I get tagged by two hunter twinks.
---
Stop trying to play with min/maxer's they get shit done fast, but they are not always fun to play \*A GAME\* with.
---
it even says " [**ambush**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ambush) in [**online games**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=online%20games) "
---
in your link lol
---
Yes, thank you. You don't owe anyone sex just as much as your SO doesn't owe you sex. This is a normal thing if you are in a long-term relationship and especially if you don't have other time for gaming or personal hobbies.
---
Not sure I haven't tried the others. I picked Cath because both bosses can drop weapons so odds of getting at least one decent blue to vendor are pretty good.
---
I'd say it's a good thing IMO but in Blizz eyes yes it is bad if they quit.
---
Just depends on if they're willing to compromise the integrity of Classic WOW, i'm sure giving people the ability to buy their way out of a PVP realm they willingly signed up for wouldn't really go over well with the people who want this to be just like Vanilla without changes.
---
&gt; I don't have a ton of time to be playing due to college so I generally just hop on to farm or quest for an hour or two.
---
That's why I rolled on a pve server. I only have an hour or two to blow off some steam, and don't want to pay $15/month for the luxury of staring at a corpse.
---
There was plenty of context. Said green boe’s. Also said they were character upgrades for not only himself but other party members. Even said they were equipped right after.
---
5 times is the max, then you're worth zero honour.
---
In all fairness, ferals make the greatest tanks for 5 man dungeons. Finding a tank is always a pain in the ass so if I get a feral asking to join who wants to dps the first thing I ask is are you willing to tank. I would take them regardless but if I can get them to tank then that’s a big hassle I don’t have to worry about.
---
Why did it only start when honor released if it's not cuz of honor?
---
Please. Tell us more.
---
Whirlwind axe is a quest item, I think you're mistaking it for Ravager.
---
I feel your pain dude, I feel your pain. Surprising how toxic some of the players are.
---
I get it, you hate the other faction or whatever.  They're just people on either side, there's no difference lol.
---
&gt; So far, I've only seen Horde being dominant (and acting tough) when they had numerical advantage. 
---
Response was to this, obviously.  Everyone does this, any faction.
---
This lowbie ganking would be relatively isolated because there are only so many places to queue for BGs.
---
Interesting point about the realm specific battle grounds being too small a pond with premades.
---
Now they can convince people to come do it.

Zandalar tribe is a great and very well populated server, you are probably just trying at the wrong times
---
Wow blizz should hire you because replicating your personal vanilla experience is EXACTLY what classic is for.....
---
You’re corpse camping alts what do u think is going to happen?
---
Instead death=you can't
---
Short answer, no, addons you are running are not something that Blizz makes viewable through any systems the addons have access to.
---
Longer answer, some addons can choose to announce their presence and give out this information. Usually they just do it to other people running the same addon, and mostly for addons that are meant to work with other people (damage meters, threat meters, some raid addons, loot council) So this does mean that the addon you are most likely to care about does have that feature. Usually a Version Check or something like that. Look around in the options.
---
dkhunter meant that hunter can't mana burn (with viper sting) druid, not that hunter can't get mana burned
---
you get honor for watching netflix, win-win.
---
Layers are incompatible with world bosses.  They aren't coming back.
---
It's about 70-30 alliance favoured tho
---
Imba servers aren't the problem... the meta is.
---
Between mages practicing their AE game from 1-60 and speccing to maximize that, to the 1-shot engineering macros to all of the guides out there to teach rogues how to perfect a person as long as their gear threshold reaches a certain point - the rock vs. paper vs. scissors aspect of the game has amplified to unplayable degrees.
---
Not really. If you halved the number of Horde and Alliance on Skeram we would still respond in minutes to opposing raids. We have discord, and in general WAY more people are trying to rank up than they did in Vanilla. Shit when they released honor in Vanilla most people weren't even 60 and prob wearing greens. It's a different game now. Tune the population numbers down and maybe you'll escape a few more ganks but people are going to be camping all the spots you expect to find level 48+ players: BRD, DM, EPL, WPL, Silithus, Winterspring, BS. There isn't a reality where a server is so dead that rankers will be too thin to cover all the popular spots in the game and if they find out you're all going to EPL to quests they're just gonna post it in Discord and follow you there.
---
People should've paid more attention to private servers if they wanted to see what the classic experience would be like. The culture of the game and sheer number of players min/maxing means even on light servers you're not going to have fun if someone is ranking up.
---
People are upset because of the impact it has on how world PvP works with it available.
---
It's kind of sad looking into the future too because a lot of the fun of AV was using the terrain and buildings to hide and ambush players. That's all going to be gone if everyone has a radar going.
---
They can find a group of 58s and run the dungeon.
---
I didn't tell him to play any other way, I said the way he plays is stupid.  He's going to wind up bored very quickly.  In the vein of his same attitude, there's plenty of new games to go min/Max if you need to flex, doing it on a 15 year old game isn't impressive, it's boring.
---
I honestly played Horde when they were outnumber faction back in Vanilla... So on this odd Flip side, I try and be sporting and avoid harming Alliance, unless I see that they instigated fight.
---
That being said this whole blood bath is testing my limits, there are a lot of try hard honour farmers on both sides atm.
---
So maybe my blood lust will come back?
---
Not every warlock is SL...
---
I am not an idiot, i rolled at launch on a pve sever......  1st there is nothing wrong at all with playing on a PVP server, (i have in the past)  but, anyone who is looking to change the basics of the game to make their leveling easier on a pvp server at this point is the idiot imo. 
---
If someone invest  the time needed to reach high 40's or low 50's and are going to Quit, let them, I dont care if players who dont like the way the game is leave. I want players who are happy with the game to play.
---
Incendious US East is owned by the Alliance. They camp all the high level dungeons with 20 person death squads. Literally every run i've done since Tuesday is a death run. 
---
The populations are rather close to equal, but Alliance just seems to own in wpvp
---
QQ
---
For example say a large group of players is running through a zone killing everyone and you see them coming over in the distance. Your first instinct would be to hide behind some terrain and wait for them to pass, but with spy that will never happen. As soon as they get close enough to you you'll pop up on their list and they will run straight to you.
---
I think it's cool world encounters like that, that are ruined by spy.
---
I mean, that's your opinion what's "meaninful" or "meaningless" PvP. I like that I show up to kargath and there's an ally raid going on, or that there's roving bands of players running through EPL and clashing over random out-of-the-way farming/quest spots. Right now, it's total anarchy, like a mob or a riot. And that's super fun and different to what we normally see in the game. That's interesting, and I don't think it should be cut down to a week because a tiny, vocal minority of the game can't level their character in peace.
---
Will a lot of people enjoy and prefer BGs? Sure, probably, I'm not disagreeing there. That's not my point though. 
---
Is the game unplayable for people &lt;60? No, definitely not; I have several alts at different level ranges and I've been running with people 50+ in dungeon groups; they are still playing the game and progressing. Sure, it's slower; but it's a pvp server, PvP was always going to slow things down.
---
Im the assistant gm fucking the gm's twin sister (paternal, gm is a dude, we are the three founding members) but dont worry we dont form an officer stonewall, we generally all have a different take and the officers pick sides, thank god for them or we wouldnt get anything done.
---
The rotation and sheer volume of complex spells and combinations of how to deal with obstacles as warrior is super fulfilling. Don't get me wrong, I love mage. I love warrior too. I've just found warrior to have a huge skillcap and low skill floor, whereas mage has a narrower difference between a good one and a great one
---
My guilt MT is a bear.  Works fine.
---
What "whole thing?"
---
I think  this is the best comment to this... I do not ever remember 40 man raids running around camping FP's.
---
I remember some PvP groups forming organically in BRM but they were typically just a couple of groups trying to get into BRD who teamed up to achieve a common goal.
---
If private servers were any indication how classic will end up in phase 3 no faction will be happy. Most of the alliance players that queued for BGs were dedicated good players because the casuals stuck to PVE. These alliance players always premade their groups for optimal honor farming in BGs. Because there is a lot more horde queue for BGs their queue times were wayyyyyyyy longer and it was almost  always a PUG for horde vs a Premade for alliance, usually ending in a 5 cap, graveyard farm in AB. Because of the long queue times as a horde player, compared to the instant queue pops as alliance, you need to min/max your honor farming. Having a little down time as possible. This resulted in horde players farming lvl 50s in searing gorge/burning steps or other lowbies in similar zones, making horde the dominant world faction while alliance dominated BGs. It's a lose/lose situation for both factions. The only winners here are the PVPers on alliance (cause they just BG spam) and PVE players on horde side (cause they own the zones).
---
Quite honestly, I'd rather have a feral tank than a warrior tank in dungeons. So many warrior tanks are horrible at aoe tanking. It happens way too often that I heal the tank at ~20% hp and 1-2 of the 3 enemies suddenly turn to me. Feral tanking is foolproof.
---
Yeah, I hate it when competitors enter the market and offer the same goods or services for less. I want to price gouge people and control supply, not have some loser come in and screw with my market.
---
We should ban those players for market manipulation. The WoW economy is too important to let random jerks ruin.
---
Yeah I sold this shit for 80 gold on my realm
---
Sex while gaming next time.
---
I agree.  The volume of whining happening on this sub by butthurt players is TOO DAMN LOUD.  Turn down the whaaaaaambulance and just enjoy this brief flourish of wpvp.
---
Yea I’m a new player but I rolled hunter as I had read it was the easiest to level. 60 in 7 1/2 days it really is no joke how much easier hunter leveling is than other classes. Pretty sure my 47 warrior is at 8 days right now and rogue took 10 haha.
---
Every single graveyard really...
---
Damn right.
---
Tbh 7/10 of the skips you can do at 60 and not 58 end up with some idiot pulling anyway
---
I've seen plenty of standard meme templates. It's pretty arbitrary.
---
Seems the same to me. /shrug
---
Is 10% strength better than 10% damage?
---
Shadow Priests downside is mana consumption. For dungeons? They provide tons of utility from buffs/ress/offheals.
---
Some people downplay Shadow Priests like this mage last night that said "well you'll only be healing as a priest" then proceeded to beat his DMG/DPS on every single pull.
---
You're also invaluable in PVP with Silence/healer utilities. SWP pushes over 2k dmg on one apply. Mind blasts that hit for 1200-1500 on average. With living action potions for rogues and free action against wars/etc, you become quite difficult to kill. Also farm out the Necropile set in Scholomance, you can get upwards of 4500 health with just fort for PVP.
---
Don’t get it
---
&gt;, horde quest hubs are better in general
---
I agree with everything except that. For alot of zones the quest hubs and FP were just tacked on after the fact and rushed. Their hubs and FP that don't have paths to them, and they are in the middle of nowhere with no vendors or inn keepers.
---
&gt; are better located for farming end game zones (org near winterspring and azshara, TB near silithus, UC near EP. 
---
Plus don't forget, there only used to be 1 AH for each side, that left the other cities completely barren. Most of those cities would be empty even if their locations are good.
---
Who cares if someone is #1 in "Honor Points" when they are absolutely trash at the game?
---
I have a 60 human warrior. I have SGC and a lot of pre raid bis. Should I reroll to gnome for pink pigtails and escape artist?
---
The mana bar most definitely displays properly with the add on. You shouldn’t be able to be burned but you do get burned and your mana bar will reflect that.
---

Yeah tbh I wished I’d seen the tree cheese method before I went hard mode on that fight lol
---
Hilarious but completely agree
---
We have a cool 70 something dude in the guild that fishes, makes mechanical squirrels to give away for free, and gives drink recipes after 5 o'clock. He's mid thirty in level and plays every day. Opposite of a power gamer but keeps the chat interesting. We're planning on a squirrels out Rag kill some day once everyone has one.
---
I've been posting everywhere in this thread but I'll do a direct reply in the offchance it doesn't get buried. As someone who is enjoying themselves in this phase, just wait it out. It is probably best to just accept that for the next month or so, this is not the same game. It is now a warzone. All out conflict between both sides for the forseeable future. Most of your guilds should be able to accept that you want to focus on pvp for a while because this is the only time you'll be able to get this much wpvp without significantly more effort. 
---
If you don't enjoy this part, then that's unfortunate, but I think you're going to regret leaving pvp servers in the long run unless you didn't enjoy them before. Things will settle down, but just try to enjoy this craziness while it lasts. So many alliance were joining raids and pushing back and camping zones on the first night, but for some reason they thought that was only going to be the first day or something. Just enjoy that. Muster your server and defend. If Menethil is being camped then post in world until you have 15 people gather in IF then fly in together. It can be really freaking fun to push them back! Trust me :) In a few weeks things will go back to the way they were and you'll miss some of these moments.
---
I’m not sure I agree that population is the cause of that particular attitude. It’s more that people are assholes.
---
I found a guild that accepts anyone and everyone. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s a zerg guild. They tossed out invites to anyone who asked, at least until they hit the player cap. Surprisingly enough, it’s a pretty nice group. Anyone who expected us to be a “hard core raid guild” or any other preconception generally gets bored and moves on. We have a 20-day inactivity removal policy to clear out people who aren’t playing anymore and that’s pretty much it.
---
&gt; Everyone does this, any faction.
---
Only one faction has a numerical advantage on an overwhelming number of servers. This is the very basis for OP's claim that Horde will have hour long WSG queues...
---
ie.: The grass can't be greener if there's no one to compare it to.
---
Go back to retail, seriously. This is what War Mode is for.
---
Because he didn't understand a highly technical mechanic based on phrasing? I'd tell you not to procreate if it wasn't already a given that you'll never have the opportunity.
---
Mages can be very annoying to deal with, I would avoid them (unless you can get the jump on them).  
---
Most other classes you can 1v1 pretty well.
---
&gt; so you expected a game centered around faction warfare to be balanced
---
just as a general statement, everyone would  
---
individual skirmishes? hell no, war happens  
---
the factions and game balance? yes, generally  
---
everybody knew the servers would be imbalanced...  
---
most expected 55-45 and 60-40 ... not 80-20  
---
blizz fucked up letting it get to that point, this is what people are mad about  
---
tell people ahead of time their faction warfare game would be an 80-20 balance and nobody would bother to play in the first place
---
I’ll preface this whole thing by saying that I don’t necessarily agree with faction queues on principle but I do see the allure. It would solve two problems almost simultaneously; faction imbalance and server overpopulation.
---
It's shocking how you people don't understand the fucking concept of voting with your wallet. I want to play the good version of this game. This is the shitty version of this game. I'm not going to pay them for the shitty version of this game, and neither are many other people. They want our money. 
---
If this isn't make-or-break for you, why are you so insistent on making other people have a shitty time? And if it is, well then *you* can GTFO when they fix it.
---
That was always a dumb accusation in all versions of AV, especially the later ones.  Horde bitched about the bridge, but at least they would mount across and come from below.
---
Alliance had to go IN a building and dismount to then go through a small door into a path with two guard towers with clear LOS on the entire path to get go through a gate.  It's ok though, Horde had to run across a wide bridge and then jump directly into one of the towers.
---
THERES NO CRIME IF YOU DO NOT GET CAUGHT
---
Never heard of it, now im downloading it, thanks!
---
Yesterday I had lvl 60 feral druid in BRD as a DPS,  my 58 lvl rogue was doing twice more single traget DPS, sorry but feral DPS is just slowing things down.
---
I AM THE LAW. WE BURN
---
When I played classic, I got ganked by raids all the time. 15 years will make your memories fuzzy. Classic was never going to be a vanilla experience, because classic isn't a vanilla game. It is a remake of a vanilla game where everything in the game has been researched and known about for over a decade. Everyone has a min/max mindset because of this, which is why there are far more 60s going into p2 than in vanilla.
---
Only one needs to be unflagged.
---
I’m so in.
---
Upvoted cause you're allowed to have an opinion
---
As compared to what it is now? I mean, I dont really see the difference between a horde only server and what we got.
---
&gt;Adding HKs without BGs
---
Oh you mean exactly how it was when released in Vanilla?  You know that thing everyone begged for.  These last couple days everyone is proving "you think you do, but you don't" correct.  I think you all owe that guy an apology.
---
Do you truly enjoy the current state of world PVP though, I never argued that BGs  are a perfect fix, but don't expect something better from blizzard.
---
In a perfect world Blizzard would be actively communicating and trying out things like faction queues, but it's (imo) better to stay pessimistic with Blizzard and ask for the easiest band-aid (Bgs)
---
This is why you NEVER EVER take server transfers.  They lead into a dead hole of a server that will never make it.  Always roll top pop servers, or else you will end up having to pay for a transfer later.
---
Some people have different opinions but for the majority of bosses you dont need to assign any healers for tanks. Rag is a different story due to being spread out. For rag best put the better geared healers that have good amount of experience on the tank side best is shamans and priests.
---
 Druids are mostly just raid healers that pop hots on people, I wouldn't assign them primarily to a tank.
---
Benediction is pretty great I think. I was able to do some quests in alterac without being camped and I have gotten a good supply of low level fair pvp encounters. Im enjoying phase 2 as a noncapped player
---
This is why i am more excited for TBC, Even with Arenas having flavour of the month skill usually meant you could force your way to a higher rating.
---
And Karazhan raid omg i loved it, World PvP was there but could be avoided with flying so less chance you got gangbanged by full raid farming honor. PvP based around Arena/Bg's was always the best with world pvp being a cherry on top. Except hellfire peninsula on launch blegh.
---
I also think they should make achievement "battlenet" wide for WoW. And unlock classic/tbc ones, For example. If more people could earn outland achievement when actually playing in outlands you give more reasons for people to stick to classic/tbc than to farm achievement on their 120 steam rolling content.
---
I mean, you try leading a group of 40 to show up on time for a raid. You might be saying "well I used to GM" a lot faster than you think.
---
I frequently run groups with 3-4 wars and a healer because I find it really fun.. You don't need meta lineups to be perfectly fine in any classic dungeon.
---
the forsaken are morally questionable from the start. go in to the dungeons of undercity
---
this guy gets it
---
Online gaming in general (combined with friends and acquaintances I've met IRL who play games) have shredded any stereotypes I'd come up with. Honestly, video games are one of the most non nerdy things I do/see others doing. 
---
I don't even know why people still have those old stereotypes in mind. Its a multi-billion dollar industry with products for every type of person that has ever lived. New genres of entertainment have been born from it, we have new genres of music because of it...... its just.... such a gigantic cultural change, especially in the places that it lowkey affects people (like how mobile gaming sleeper hit the nation and caused people to spend billions of dollars on skinner boxes).
---
Weird, I'm getting the same bug at the horde FP in azshara
---
I'm always taking the one who will roll against me on less pieces of gear in that situation. If they are equal, I'll take the 58 if everyone else is 60. The 60 will have an easier time finding the next group.
---
Probably due to insecurities I'd guess. I agree with your points though, all the quests in the 50+ range are basically unaccessible now. I've leveled main to 60 already but I'm trying to level an alt and that shit is frustrating.
---
Yes it is. You should be able to just copy and paste that folder
---
Give ghosts the distract ability of rogues and make it work on opposing faction only.
---
I mean it just makes sense for them to be around Flight masters and everyone on PVP servers should've known that honor farming would be a big thing once P2 started.
---
Kinda another instance of Classic's Social necessity you fly as a group or get camped my boy.
---
And on the other end these dudes are prob having a blast socializing while basically getting to cyberbully the alliance players.
---
&gt;PvP was an afterthought.
---
I didn't strawman you, this was your claim. How is it an afterthought if it was baked into the game?
---
Priorities may shift but nothing ends.
---
Have a 1 year old and 4 year old. Work 40-45 hours per week. Played 43 rounds of golf this summer and my lock is 60 despite starting classic 3 weeks late.
---
Just make sure you prioritize your time as you desire and leave enough for the kids. They do sleep after all!
---
For warriors, green quests are our yellow quests.  Orange quests are red to us, etc etc.
---
People are having fun in a video game. What do you have against that?
---
Oh they will 100% do TBC, and probably WotLK as well. There is absolutely no way greedy ass blizzard is going to turn down basically free money. All the assets are there, the content is already produced, it takes a few teams to get it ready for a re-release and thats it. WotLK "Classic" would probably represent the biggest influx of players ($$$$$) since, well, WotLK "Vanilla".
---
Classic+ is a whole different beast though...
---
Yes.
---
You are an absolute fucking moron. Classic appeals to you because you aren't being camped by 20 horde in all contested zones. Are you so simple minded that you cant view issues from other perspectives? Just because your bum NEET ass is having fun camping the opposite faction doesn't mean that it is a) Enjoyable for the people being camped nor b) Healthy for the game.
---
I’ve been doing this on my pally in gadgetzan. Works very well. You’ll get ganked every now and again but it’s usually just once when trying to go the dungeon then you’re fine after that
---
Most alliteration NA
---
They're not fun to play with at all but I would say that this type of person is like 60-70% of the community. I am just so happy to have found a guild of people who just want to enjoy Classic and not dictate how others are playing. They're all fucking MVPs.
---
The hero we need.
---
It's been like this 15 years ago as well. The notion that everyone who played computer games back then is a fat nerd is utterly stupid and vile.
---
Exactly. Yet, that guy who's comeback was "Guess you didn't play vanilla." doesn't seem to remember that and would rather avoid having a discussion, despite this post being tagged with the "discussion" flair. Them Hordies aren't rocket surgeons...
---
I like how you all are continuing to prove "you think you do but you don't" was correct all along.
---
&gt; Terrible idea. I shouldn’t have to elaborate why.
---
Usually helps when having a discussion though XD
---
Or be set to running speed if you are within 5 yards of them and slow to a walk if you are further away.
---
Well I'm not American so maybe it's an american problem and not a gamer problem.
---
so is lbrs. I think I leveled my tank from 57-60 exclusively in lbrs. It was 30-40% of a level per run without rested exp.
---
Partially because of paid transfers between factions.
---
Wrong sub though. I'll play next weekend for new season :D
---
reckoning bombs when nobody expects them, including myself
---
It's one of the few quests in the game that makes you better at your class
---
This question is stealthed
---
You missed the part where they were higher level and brought their mains too?
---
Unless you're doing crazy skips that require level 60 agro range, thinking a lower level healer can't make it is stupid. They don't need to worry about hitting the boss like dps and tanks do so being underleveled is more about what abilities you have and considering most healers will downrank anyways a level 50 can be just as good as a level 60 at equivilent gear levels.
---
Yeah I agree they are alluring. But I feel it’s too late for them. Telling people who could play before that they aren’t allowed isn’t good. I understand that the people getting ganked non stop are frustrated because they’re having their enjoyment taken from them. But the answer isn’t to take enjoyment away from others to fix that.
---
The nerdiest subset of games I often see are speedrunners. Not the ones that try to get a reasonably decent run of like..... 10 different games. Nah, i'm talking about the guy who spends 12 years doing nothing but playing Wind Waker and trying to glitch the game to the point of skipping 70% of the game due to a teleport or wall glitch. Those guys often look like the nerd in OPs pic.
---
My Balance Druid heart understands this on such varying levels. Stay strong my friend - enjoy your Druid how you want to. ❤️ Why else play a video game if you're not enjoying yourself? 🙏
---
I haven't done a ton of spawn camping flight paths, as the alliance feed to thorium is either an anemic trickle or an insurmountable flood depending whether a guild is arriving or not.        
---
          
---
But the appeal of a dozen horde watching a tasty alliance member fly in, land, and get blown up instantly seems very self evident to me, as does the 'oh shit' feeling of flying into a flight path with a bunch of yellow names and skulls down below.       
---
       
---
I won't say it's a blast *every* time, but it's a novel experience I'm glad we have and that I am in no hurry to get rid of.
---
No I’m positive I took a screenshot on my pc to laugh and joke with my buddy as he’s a mage but he has low dps haha
---
Who said anything about coordinated fights? You are literally putting words in my mouth. 
---
Read the text. Jesus Christ. There is a world of difference between not wanting to get shit on for 2 hours by geared 60s with nothing better to do and play PvE scrub. 
---
I want world pvp that is actually players in a zone that are interacting with that zone and it's content fighting for the resources there. What we have now is not that. It is literally the players who are bored shitting on everyone else.
---
Perfect meme.
---
I'm level 60 and even I'm doing this.
---
We took a 57 mage to MC last week.
---
He crushed the decursing meter.
---
it's only going to be shit for a coupla weeks, and virtually gone by the time battlegrounds get rolled out
---
I have yet to dungeon with a boomy. I haven't rejected any, none have responded to my lf3dps requests. I just want to run with one.
---
I would go alchemy. or engineering. Im not on them but i know alchs can do transmutes, e.g. undead to water and arcanite bar transmutes.
---
The problem with enchanting is that it requires double effort. You have to stand in town and hawk your skills whereas with any other profession you can just put it up on the AH then get back out there.
---
BWL was really the high point of salvation though because of all the threat drops.  Blizzard kind of moved past making those so common.  AQ opens with Skeram/Bug Family and Sartura, who really aren't big threat fights.  Fankriss was a stupid dps burn that we even did in like 40 seconds 13 years ago so I can't imagine it's too hard now.  Huhuran was never a threat issue but the enrage.  Emps reset every teleport and Cthun wasn't really a tankable fight.  We did Ouro and i honestly still have no idea how some of the shit on that fight worked, and viscidus is the worst fight in Wow's history.
---
I don't really remember anything off hand from Naxx where threat was a massive problem except on the first Thaddius polarity if a DPS went off just a tad early.
---
Most of Aq and Naxx either had target switchng to help keep threat lower or entire resets to make aggregate threat less of a problem.  Salvation is probably at it's peak in BWL though.
---
Yeah man! The game is all about being social. I've done my time in BC and WOTLK with gear checks and gear score etc. My girlfriend just started playing, it's been so much fun leveling with her right beside me.
---
You do not stand a chance against mages. Give up on that one.
---
Priest is winnable. The real trick is getting through their shield since you don't generate rage when hitting them. You might want to give them a second to actually cast the shield before dumping your rage. Better to spend that rage breaking the shield than doing a little but of real health damage since you'll get more rage once the bubble is down. You can also make Rage and Greater Rage potions pretty cheap to get you through it.
---
Warlock even if you kill them you're going to die from DoTs after. You need to get lucky and demolish them or have heals.
---
No you should just greed the BoE epic if you trust everyone else, but chances are someone else has already needed.

Am I the only one that thinks all these unpopular opinion posts don't really share any unpopular opinions ?
---
I am a dj a nurse and a wow player. Good luck locating me kek
---
RIP azshara essence farmers! Water pvp is going to suck! Unless your a druid/lock/shaman
---
Far more serious as mom can always just bring the poopity bucket when time comes
---
dude blizz didnt even ban the lfg addon from the beta
---
qq get gud
---
I guess, maybe blizzard shouldn't have fucked us by overloading the servers tho? Idk. I live the idea of pvp servers, and ultimately blizzard failed to provide what a lot of people hoped for.
---
You can't maintain a new expansion every two years business model if a large portion of your subscribers are playing the base game.
---
You can still arcane crystal farm, just do DM:E jump runs with no other miners.
---
But breaking that addon was a simple fix, it simply denied addons to get X/Y/Z coordinates from the API. Breaking Spy would break tons of other addons at the same time.
---
Hi there, I have like you ended up assigning the healing for my guild although I do have experience from many many years of expansions and officer positions. What I do in our raids is assign buff groups, make sure people are in the right groups (paladins in my case, shamans in yours, preists being spread for PoH), I assign three people on tank healing at the start of the raid and they will be enough for most fights. Depending on how your guild does things and how your tanks are specced you may have to assign specific tank healers on some bosses. Examples for us with three tanks, two DW fury prots and a bear, is Garr where we two tank it and they take massive damage. Druids are tank healers for sure however you can only have one on a tank at a time because their HoTs dont stack. Dispel assignments and positioning may also be required to be assigned on some fights, I usually keep a notepad doc open that i set up on the run to BRM with the breakdown of whos doing what on which fight and then copy paste into our healing channel. Your job is to make it a smooth ride for everyone, the healers and the people needing healing :) GL!
---
not everyone goes on a pvp server who wanted to pvp,people for over 14 years on retail if they wanted to raid on a hardcore guild had to go on a pvp server,or if they wanted to play with friends or family they **HAD NO CHOICE.** 
---
you must be a ganker right? because only gankers have no sympathy for anyone's feelings but your own. "u rolled on a pvp server so fuck u,let me kill you like the cannon fodder u are" they will outright quit cause yeah fuck ganking trash. nothing but bullies who have no care for humanity.
---
Sounds like torch room. If it is torch room the only time you can really drink is at one of the two torches and then after the second torch. That room has endless respawns and forces you to continue moving at all times.
---
We’re talking about different things here - 
---
A high-level (often pre-BiS) BoE epic worth hundreds of gold vs. a leveling blue that will be replaced in ~10 levels. 
---
Most leveling dungeons I’ve been in let people need on BoE blues if they actually needed them and we’re going to equip them.
---
Alliance isn't even a faction in TBC... so
---
lets hope and pray Blizz doesn't fuck the game up with that expac.
---
I'm not 60 and I'm having fun. It's nice to get ganked sometimes. Keeps you on your toes!
---
I'm on a nearly perfectly balanced server though.
---
hmmm maybe bambi or toy story?
---
At least you have a safe flight path... chillwinds always camped :(
---
Most mods allow quality control rules (such as standard meme template rules) to be violated if the post is highly upvoted before they notice it. Not sure about classic wow mods tho.
---
God I hate this bullshit attitude. I’m a dagger rogue, there’s like.. zero BoEs of interest to me and I *still* think it’s bullshit. Stop this obsession with gold and let people who can actually use an item win it in a run and feel like they earned it rather than clicking a button on the AH.
---
I’ve been in two DM groups where the dragonslayer compendium has dropped and both times I’ve gotten to see a tank have their fucking year made instead of someone going “ooh yay I get a few thousand gold”.
---
Seriously there are so many gold farming methods in this game and like nothing to spend it on once you get a mount. Why is everyone so obsessed about gold?
---
I once had a group say that they will take me on their run as long as I promised to/dance in Boomkin form as much as possible. Felt like Santa with the amount of joy it brought that group 😂😂😂😂
---
I was aware of it but never did it before, seemed easy enough cuz i followed right behind guy, but the other three didnt know and jumped at the wrong spot and fell into a box or something idk, then they got out and caught up, definitely seemed like it took longer than normal
---
THat's an odd way to spell glorious.
---
&gt; (you can kinda thank Fortnite for that, in part anyways). 
---
IMO Halo (and then to an even larger extent, Call of Duty) really laid the majority of the groundwork for making video games mainstream. Fortnite is the final stage of mass acceptance and appeal.
---
I didnt say you did. Good straw man argument...you really showed that straw man wassup
---
Thank you from a cloth wearing 51lvl.
---
?! What's wrong with enh shamans in 5 mans? Totems for whatever ya like and solid dps.
---
I’m not saying it isn’t. The guy up there might think it sucks but that in no way makes him self absorbed.
---
holy shit dude
---
those people are everywhere honestly, no matter what server you go to you will run into these types that either dont work, or have absolutely no social life so they spend 20 hours a day playing this game. People like us that have jobs and lives can't compete with these people.
---
Trying to get to WPL and 3 rogues trolling Bulwark entrance. Never made it in...
---
I mean, that really is the only option for them at this point. If you rolled on a server with a bad balance of factions, that really sucks. But there is no quick fix for that, and it was and always has been inevitable since vanilla. People on unbalanced servers have 2 choices that can fix their issue personally.. stay on the server and hate your life, or go to a new one with balance. I guarantee specific faction dominated servers aren't having fun on either side. On one end you got the boredom of farming few of the opposite faction because of the imbalance. And on the other you have those that stand little to no chance to even remotely enjoying pvp. It sucks, but the only fix right now is a transfer.
---
Maybe if you're stupid and charge directly into a zerg.
---
Warriors have a much easier time stacking piles of hp without sacrificing damage, don't run out of resources in combat, and have miles more combat utility. Debuffing enemies, scattering clusters, nuking squishies, etc.
---
Ret paladin charges in, he does a little damage. Warrior does it, he does more damage while simultaneously disrupting them heavily.
---
So an arbitrary price difference is all that separates it?
---
Imagine thinking your 15 dollars is worth more than someone elses.
---
Dude you're the one crying that 4 other people wont sacrifice THEIR time for you. You're a hypocrite. You were even given a logical and correct course of action in order to take care of it. But go ahead and blame someone else for your lack of foresight. It's not like this is a new game.
---
Just buy his and repost them if it's by that big of a margin
---
&gt;Those of us that played on pservers know exactly how this will go.
---
The largest group of losers in the community... Pserver people are fucking trash and I wish you all would leave so that better people who want to enjoy the experience could actually do so. 
---
You guys are just dopamine addicts who stuck with the same game for so long because you figured out how to maximize the amount you can get your brain to produce in this game. 
---
Whether its the spellcleave meta or the roaming pvp deathballs, you guys can't chill because you literally only care about that next hit of sweet dopamine.
---
Slightly, but not really. If the low level attacks then all restrictions are off. If you attack the low level first then this restriction would be off. If you were to just try to aoe one solo low level it would not effect them, you would have to 'attack' them first with a direct attack. Just making it so that low levels couldn't exploit the system op suggested. Really not that big of a deal, not like you would use aoe to attack a solo low level anyway.
---
... until I got an arrow in the knee.
---
Either you're forgetting someone or those vanilla rogues were really bad and/or unlucky. All a rogue has to do to beat a shadow priest is not get stun resisted (happens 80% of the time) and deny you any opportunity to play the game. There's no counter to stunlocking as a priest if you don't see it coming and the stun resistance doesn't proc. Add blind, vanish, thistle tea, cold blood, and preparation to the equation, and you're completely hopeless.
---
Nope. You made your bed. You lay in it.
---
Two servers =/= "most".
---
Same. I take who shows up as long as I think we have a chance. No CC and three warriors? Looks like you boys are off-tanking! 
---
We'll figure it out.
---
Any idea if shadow reflector could mean the difference between winning and losing?
---
I'm on horde side pvp server so every time I think I'm in danger 5 random hordes come and save me. THIS IS THE TRUE HARD MODE.
---
Looks like we we're all wrong unless you went rppvp. Those guys just seem like they are having so much fun.
---
Probably questie :) ty
---
Do you think people didn't track their farm efficiency in Vanilla?
---
My name is Vincent Adultman and I'm very tired from crunching numbers at the business factory.
---
Why don't you convince the community to create one truly balanced server then move there yourself?
---
In any regard something does need to be done. It isn’t right that some people can’t even do anything due to the ganking. I’m seeing more and more posts regarding it. Sure, there’s the age old adage of “should have rolled on a PvE server” and all of that garbage but for those that wanted to roll on a PvP server and actively contribute it’s just been a slaughter for the heavily imbalanced servers.
---
transfer/roll  on a low pop server
---
 play the game the same way you would on a high pop server.
---
transfer to high pop later with thousands and thousands worth of materials you were able to gather with next to no competition or buy for next to nothing.  
---
Profit,
---
The most important thing you can do during ice block is wait on cooldowns. That sweet, sweet frost nova/blink cooldown.
---
This isn't vanilla, it's Classic. A modern day remake that can never be the original for a ton of reasons. Gotta play Classic and enjoy Classic, not play Classic and try to have Vanilla.
---
They should say they need a mage. That said, did brd last night without a caster for aoe and the torch part was a pain lol
---
To be honest, druids will struggle on heal meters in MC. The boss fights are typically short so other healers can burn Mana to heal snipe.
---
Honor is calculated the day after, moron. Read the damn headers.
---
Please let pets retain corrupted blood....
---
You are literally the rudest person on this whole thread. And to all the times you have said "what, your time is more important then mine". Well yes, yes it is. You are not my friend nor are you even an acquaintance. I owe you nothing and therefore you will be lumped into the category of dps. Now in this category there are people who play a variety of specs, some of which say things about the person that before even speaking to them. Like, I will contribute and try hard to make this successful and others say I'm just trying to have fun and prefer to do whatever I want to do. When reviewing this list of people a group leader has to make the best choice for the success of the group, because it is not just his time but 4 or many more  others he has to consider as well. So please get off of your petty ass high horse and shut the fuck up.
---
Yeah I think that's where it was, but even before we started the room i was oom from the buffs, then they start and i stop drinking at half and then it was just downhill from there..
---
Man. I played wow In vanilla. I’m right in the average for that range. 
---
It’s making me wanna get itttttt
---
Long story short, 5 accounts and lots of macro work with some add-ons or blizz-approved programs like ISboxer or keyclone or ahk, as long as nothing is done without a keypress from you
---
Pretty much. You can look at it like “everyone needs gold”
---
As someone in a similar situation, phase 1 PvP was a lot of fun.
---
I'm not sure what you mean 2 weeks. We've known it was going to happen phase 2 and that phase 2 was going to be around this time. I'm by no means part of the people enjoying world PvP right now being on a server so horde dominated that going to BRD is a minimum of 4 corpse runs, but it's a bit silly to pretend like this wasn't expected or on short notice.
---
I cant wait to start distracting people off bridges and stuff.  Sometimes gank. Other times be annoying hahahha
---
MARSHALL WINDSOR !
---
If you do this you definitely want to be a miner for the 2-3 Rich Thorium at the end.
---
I'm not having any trouble leveling so far. Just hit 49 this weekend.
---
You just have to go exploring and find a nice out of the way spot to grind. For example, I had the rage scar yeti cave in northern Feralas to myself for most of last night. All the Alliance war parties were patrolling the roads.
---
Yeah the idea of PvP is fun to me but I didn't think that it would take this long to level sadly
---
Try playing on a PvP server. It's a much different and more brutal world (of warcraft)
---
If I was starting a pug for any 5 man content, feral Druid would be my number one choice for a dps(coming from a warlock) With pugs you never know what you’re going to get and adaptability is important. Tank goes down, boom get in bear. Healer is lacking, boom cast some heals. Dps is sufficient for any instance in the game.

I usually wake up early even when I got nothing to do.
---
Playing in the morning on the weekends, I can't even count how many times some guy I was questing with told me something along the lines of "gotta go, daughter is waking up" "the kid is crying, cya"
---
Yes. Thanks for proving my exact point. It's not a new game. So why is everyone acting like it is? That the only way we know how to "succeed" in this game and progress so that you can see more content is by rushing through it? Doesn't seem to make any sense to me.
---
Yeah the guild I’m in has one but told me I can battle for the spot, my issue is finding dungeon groups I get told no 8/10 times I try to get into a group.
---
That person cares. Using your example, they are trash, and being top honor is all they've got going for them.
---
Either you haven't played an undead (for at least 10 levels), or your idea of "moral" is troubling. I haven't played an undead past level 20, but I see they are decidedly Evil -- no "questionable" to it.
---
This is not to say the other races don't also have troublesome morals, but to say the undead are only "morally questionable" is an understatement.
---
I feel like a lot of people will do this, I wish they would have waited longer for p2 lol.
---
I don't use spy, but my vanas Kos add-on has similar functionality. Spoilers: I played vanilla with nothing more than UI add-ons, I pulled out my combat log to the right side and used it then.
---
I think it needs to be banned. I was roaming around in EPL/WPL in a party of 5 and the players with Spy would just stop and starting running around in circles until they find the rogue/druid/nightelf that was nearby hiding. It's OP as fuck and negates hiding of all things.
---
Some of your addons broadcast their version to other players with the same addon. DBM (also it can mask itself as bigwigs lol), details (insist they install it with tinythreat instead of ctm), etc. 
---
For other tracking, make sure they install ERT classic.
---
Damn I’d hate running pugs if this is the standard. Guild runs all day
---
Obviously anyone 60 n geared loves it...
---
I agree - when we take pugs everything is open roll so as to be fair to them. This is standard on my server.
---
I’m talking about a pug run by a guild known for ninjaing, with a GM that has openly ninja’d and encourages all members to do it if it means gearing up the guild. They are *not* giving you any gear.
---
Yeah, they're just ignorant. You can't learn any of the waters until 5 levels above their use requirement.
---
Imagine thinking the nominal monthly sub has anything to do with what this discussion is about. I couldn't give a shit less about $15/month, that's a drop in the bucket compared to actual bills.
---
The irony of what you're saying is palpable. You think that, somehow, its OK for you to be a selfish player who refuses to use their *class inherent flexibility* to bring something useful to the table, but its abhorrent for other people to be selfish about who *they* take in *their* groups.

Raiding? Hello?
---
Spell damage gear was not common through most of vanilla. A lot of it didn't get properly itemized until nearly TBC. Once it dropped, it was embraced rapidly, but we have itemization to choose from that often did not exist throughout most of vanilla, so it's not a fair comparison.   
---
It wasn't that it was unknown.
---
I dont think there's anything wrong with that. If he's holy spec the fact that it's cloth doesn't matter, and it's still an upgrade for him, even if its a smaller one. It's not his fault your wife doesn't have any stats on her head item for some reason

Had a female GM on disability that would lead raids while her daughter would cry in the background that she was hungry.

Another Enhance Bro here,  large battle PVP like Hillsbrad isnt really great for our spec.  Too often you run in and get instakilled so basically you sit back and wait for people to charge into you.  I'd recommend going and trying small-scale PVP instead - I spent last night in WS with a 5man battling other gankers and it was a lot more fun.
---
Eeeh, it's not the talents themselves that bug me. I actually kinda like that system; the options are strong and meaningful and you are free to choose micro vs passives. What I very much do not like is the forced choice at 10 that locks you into a spec and the subsequent pruning that this choice entails. I don't want to play a Marksman Hunter or a Guardian Druid; I want to play a Hunter or a Druid, with all attendant complexity.
---
Funny enough, this design of picking a specialization at an early level which then locks out the rest of the class for you is what drove me away from old-school MMO's like DaoC in the first place. They were all boasting massive numbers of playable classes, but each one had maybe 3-4 abilities that they actually used, making the experience fairly thin. By contrast, WoW rolled out with only 9 classes, 8 per side, but each one had incredible depth. 
---
I remember playing my NE huntard back in '05 and just being blown away by the number of choices and abilities. I had melee abilities, ranged abilities, traps, a trainable pet, tracking, anti-stealth, etc. I distinctly recall thinking that in a game like DaoC/EQ this class would be sliced up into 2-3 separate classes easy, but in WoW I had it all. And then the talent system let me sort of tilt my gameplay towards one of those things without completely forsaking the others. 
---
And then retail went and actually fucking did the thing I hated. And then reeeeally doubled down on it in the later expansions.
---
This is true. My son and I work out rather heavily in between gaming sessions, and we both resemble the last picture. My sons friends are all football players and wrestlers too and they all play. Its hilarious when someone gets mad and calls us fat asses or something. It's like "yeeup, got me. Har har. *pops pecks* heyuck heyuck."
---
I prefer the "need for your main spec, or the off spec you are playing so this group can function". I never want the shadow priests that decided to heal to feel like they shouldn't roll for items for the main spec they gave up playing for the rest of the group. Same thing with an arms warrior that is tanking for us.
---
Healers and tanks get to roll on healing and tank gear, and if that's not the players main spec, they also get to roll main spec.
---
I don't have experience but I heard they scale really well and can still outplay every class
---
Happy witcher noises
---
fuck it,i got my answer.....you really have no sympathy for another human being,typical ganking pvp trash. im done arguing with you,because u dont give a damn,its either roll over and die,or fuck off.
---
No, since all Soulstones share 30 minute cooldowns.
---
But that's exactly the point you are missing. You don't understand it and are judging everyone wanting to play that way. What is fun for on might not be fun for all. You do you, but when others want to play another way let them do them. Look in the mirror.

---
Here's an article that reference wow realm mergers, although it provides no definitive dates for when the mergers occurred. 
---
Providing overall player statistics is a dumb metric to use considering the term "dead server" existed in Vanilla. There were absolutely servers with only 1 raiding guild per faction, and I was on one of those servers. 
---
If you have nothing to add except some irrelevant google statistics, I'd advise you to take the same advice as I gave the other guy and stop typing because now because I'm about to have to head home after having suffered both of your verbal diarrhea.
---
It's hilarious how hard you are proving my points. Even to the point where you are talking down and cursing at a random stranger online purely because they are choosing to play a game how they want. Your idea of fun sounds like it's pretty hollow. Where is your fun in the game going to be 4 months into Phase 6? It'll be nom existent and you'll quit; wasting all of the time you put into the game. Meanwhile; others who are having fun purely just playing the game will still be here long after. None of you are going to last. You all just want to flex how good you are while it's the cool thing to do; and then you'll all move onto the next big hot competitive game to do the same flexes. I hope you realize it's a never ending chain that is only going to leave you wanting.
---
Did someone really say they were going to kill you in real life for playing a balance druid?
---
? Go anyways outside the man city

Started playing when i was 9, can confirm this is 100% true
---
But you're claiming your time is more valuable than the 4 others?
---
I mean, I get your point and I agree with it - bring the player not the spec - but you aren't going to win anyone over to your side yelling, "DO YOU THINK YOUR TIME IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE?" while simultaneously saying that your time is more important than 4 other peoples' time.

Imagine being this sure about something which is wrong.
---
Several times actually. Yes. People have issues; and the people attacking me in this thread are just further proving it. They're getting so upset over how someone is having fun because they think it hinders or ruins their idea of fun. It's like being mad at someone for breathing *your* air.
---
&gt;Home gym - makes an absolute world of difference.
---
Seconded. Rogue Fitness power rack is probably the best investment i've ever made, had it for about six years now.
---
I play a warlock right now as I never leveled one back in Vanilla. I'm also garbage at video games though, so there's no such thing as a fixed fight I can't lose lmao. I just don't sweat the ganking too hard, I've been forced to take a break or leave areas before but it is what it is. I'm also bullheaded so I'll keep trying probably longer than I should sometimes. It just doesn't get to me though, it's part of the game.
---
"People complain about the meta it has created, but they shouldn't have rolled on PvP servers if they don't like world PvP."

Whats happening right now is not world pvp

Don't forget they all had the Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal.
---
Not my experience as 60 Alliance. Everywhere feels like at least 3 to 1
---
Just wait until you're in the right guild and make sure you're on discord during the raids. And if you aren't hearing them *now*, ohhh you just wait when Blackwing Lair debuts and the raiding requirements go up.
---
Am I expected to know everyone else's BiS list? Because if not, the situation you describe is suuuuuper narrow, right?
---
Nah you can't punish people for something that's not their fault
---
This is completely inaccurate. I distribute the Domo loot as ML every single week.
---
It makes him nut.
---
The war effort can be done day 1 but the scepter quest takes 2 bwl clears so it has to take at least 2 weeks.
---
Rank 3 also gives you a 10% discount with your entire faction's vendors. Like having Honored with does. And they do stack.
---
There's no trick. Fishing is an art.
---
How did you do that
---
Arena runs can be safely and easily done with a party of 52s. Caring about specific dps builds and specs for this at 58/60 is like optimizing your deadmines runs.
---
As someone who rolled pve from the start welcome
---
No. You’re citing one single server. We’re not talking about that server.
---
Simply untrue. My guild uses Master Loot and sent me the Leather FR shoulders while I was on the other side of the zone heading back to Rag. I do think it used to be like that for a while in Vanilla (similar to how the loot from DM Tribute is FFA even when using Group Loot), but it's worked fine in Classic.
---
There's a guy in my horde guild that vapes into his mic.
---
I think the mlp bronies cross over with the pokemon fans quite a bit after a quick glace through twitch.
---
You’re right, now that I think about it. There’s that one quest in Hillsbrad where an apothecary orders you to poison a puppy. The Undead are irredeemably evil.

Oh god...you just summed it up perfectly. Why is it always the dps that need a smoke break?!

Roll an alt on a pve server a stfu. I have no sympathy for people bitching about pvp servers. It was the same 14 years ago. Old vanilla players pointed this out a long time ago. I’m not a pvp’r myself. I’m not good at it. If I get pack raped by a bunch of ally looking to farm honour in EPL I don’t bitch and complain on reddit like a spoilt brat. I just res and continue on farming and kill ally if, and only if I know I can win.

I literally quoted what you said, how much clearer can I be to explain it to you?  I can only say you're just being dishonest at this point.  There's no point to this discussion.
---
It's great if your hearth is Kargath and you don't feel like coughing up for a port. Also, the FP in moonglade that takes you to felwood/winterspring is pretty fucking fast.
---
Rogues just sap people as they land and wait for the buff to fade. Sheep works too.
---
No she lost the roll,  but it is what it is, forced her to realize she had a shit item in her head slot lol
---
It's the journey bro! Have fun!
---
I [H] got attacked in Tirisfal Glades while not flagged
---
While the other half of Trolls highly recommend it.
---
You either accept it for what it is or you accept that you made a mistake by rolling on a PvP server, and to me it just seems like you don’t like being on a PvP server.
---
Or they can just quit the game.
---
I mean hes a geared mage on the dominate side of a 60/40 server.  This post is meme worthy
---
Agree! But its often the fault of the player for not understanding what X bis list is bis for.
---
You cant block back to back because Hypothermia.
---
This was my plan too, but I can’t even get into black rock mountain for the past week or so. Lmao
---
Pick up the loot as you go and distribute it afterwards. You can trade the loot for 2 hours from when you pick it up (each piece has it's own individual timer from when looted) and if you are actually doing a speed run you will have plenty of time to spare.
---
Nah bro, I am hoochymamma in that pic.
---
What we do is : I MC the target, hit mov once and release, due to the target attacking he is now yield honor so we can kill him safe and sound :)
---
So no, we are not dumb after all :)
---
For a second it looked like it was missing a hand
---
THIS IS VANILLA. THIS IS WHAT IT WAS LIKE - more or less... sheesh 
---
If you don’t like it take a walk. Goddam friggin babies
---
Ah yes, the old "Even if my idea of doing me is excluding others and demeaning them for it, clearly I am in the right because that's just me doing me."
---
agreed. while it is true that back then people didnt fight that much outside of tarren mill/southshore and Ashenvale... its awesome, its exciting, danger is around every corner, and people are prepared for it. its just good pvp matches all around...
---
if you are the lonely guy that gets killed all the time, hang around others, make some friends, call them out in defense chat or world; do something, of course its boring if you just mindlessly get killed. and i say this and im from mandokir, alliance, which is "supposedly" 85H-15A (i dont believe so)
---
What server was this on?
---
You had a bad feral player.  Feral is (in my biased opinion) probably the most viable 'meme' spec among all of the hybrid classes.
---
While playing it, I've noticed it doesn't have very good damage when there are multiple mobs that die relatively quickly, but then neither do rogues.  However on high HP single target enemies, it does pretty comparable dps to rogues while also bringing the utility of 3% crit buff for melee and an offtank, and a healer.
---
Ah yes as an adult I drink the alcohol all the time!
---
Yeah, but it's a PVP server at prime time. Don't fuck around.
---
Someone give this man a medal
---
..... if anything they will put layers back for a couple months like they did with release of vanilla. Stop complaining
---
Not on a Phase 2 pvp server it isn't.
---
Also who cares if it's "5 man" when it's pretty easy to find more than 5.
---
I dunno...
---
As a scrub casual who levels slow and plays with just a couple friends same as I did back then... feels about the same to me except that I know where things are this time around and I'm not making quite as many alts.
---
Main differences are less gold seller spam, less maintenance downtime, and different topics for the political BS to ignore in trade chat.
---
&gt;betting and playing a game that's destroying people's lives.
---
There's a lot of things that can destroy lives, alcohol, drugs (yes i know alcohol is a drug but some people see that as separate which is stupid), gambling, etc, but whether it destroys their life or not **depends on the person**, it's the abuse not necessarily the use, if you actually know how to control yourself and use in moderation you'll see basically no problems at all, but once you indulge without stopping that's when you go on the deep end.
---
Sure it's ignorance but it's still wrong and a legitimate reason to get frustrated and avoid playing with whomever lacks understanding of itemisation.only because it's an upgrade for you it's not always legitimate to roll, you might have several options that might be better for your class while the other class doesn't. I don't know how many times I've come across priests needing on omnicast boots in brd or bahntosh sash. They have much better options and are far from as reliant on spell hit as for instance warlocks that which it's the best stat for.
---
Meeting people from all walks of life was one of the things that made WoW truly amazing. That was one of the reasons why it was so popular. It wasn't just a game it was an entire sub-culture during it's prime. I met and talked to people from all over the world and from all walks of life. As a  kid from a small farming town in the Midwest it was a major eye opener for me.
---
I played wow with doctors and lawyers, factory workers, people in all the branches of the military, bus drivers, Dj's, house husbands, mechanics, high-school kids,  accountants, and a lady who worked for a phone sex hotline. They were from all over North America.
---
Wow classic hasn't quite recaptured that feeling of awe for me, but it's gotten closer than any game has in a long time.
---
“is your brain incapable of to understand” well done, mate. 
---
And what side am I on? I pretty much hate blizzard and only play their game when my addiction makes me. But saying they’re responsible for faction imbalance or for the honor system that the playerbase asked for is just being an entitled little brat like you seem to be.
---
Imagine thinking your time is worth more than someone elses.
---
There should have been some sort of incentive for players to balance out the factions such as a faction specific queue. If the queue for Horde is 1 hour while the Alliance queue is 15 minutes I'm sure there would be people who would switch to Alliance to have shorter queue times.
---
See, here’s the problem. Even if it’s just for days; those people not at 60 are now falling even further behind the curve. I was lucky that I only needed like 80k xp to ding when P2 dropped. I hid in BRS to ding, and now I’m out there doing shit. But not everyone is 60, and the fact that these raid-geared 60s are out there ganking anyone and everything is obnoxious to those just  trying to level. Personally I think BGs should have dropped simultaneously but that’s neither here nor there. The point is that it’s distributive to those that are still trying to make it to 60, and it’s not fair to them.
---
Doesn't matter how much gold it is. 1g or 95g. :)
---
This is extra funny/relevant for me. I got back into classic with a friend; he's a former fitness model and currently a competitive crossfit athlete and I'm a competitive masters track athlete and running coach. Oh, and I have a guildie that's a amateur bodybuilder.
---
Ok zoomer
---
Fear mongering isn’t a good argument. Classic won’t die because BC was launched it may shrink but tbh I think that’s inevitable but as private servers have proven vanilla is a popular flavor. So is BC and WoTLK. Please stop trying to lead a movement based off fear.
---
What server are you on? I'm on Stallag and this was true pre-P2, but after P2 it's very much the opposite. 
---
Every single horde takes the opportunity to gank you due to how bad the faction imbalance is, because even if they can't kill you on their own, they know if they can just stall for about 30 seconds, a 10+ person raid will come back them up due to the Spy addon.
---
And this is in every zone. I'm a paladin so I've just accepted that taking a few deaths at the FP is going to be par-the-course for entering a zone. Right now I'm farming thorium veins, so I just do a loop of the zone and see if I can find any. By the time I'm done with probably half the loop I've already died 3 times and had my thorium jacked because I chose to mount up which triggers Spy, or had a mob accidentally agro onto me, which triggers Spy.
---
Yup, Vanilla is not comparable to Classic when Feint Death + Trap doesn't work in PVP most of the time.
---
Dont devalue yourself ZG was a fucking blast
---
Except this won't pass until phase 3 or BGs come out. 
---
I'm this close to quitting and I'm *horde* 
---
I dont know whether my alliance bros are idiots or masochists.
---
you have arguably a better flight path spot to BRM, but a longer flight.
---
Because Horde is better
---
break down the population numbers of ONLY PVP realms, what does that look like?
---
Wrath was the golden age of arenas, thats why there were these huge arena pservers based on 3.3, which multiple retail glads and pro-players used to play on because that was the peak of arenas.
---
Nobody ever gave a fuck about BC arenas, they were a joke. 
---
Cata was also really good because cool spells, smokebomb, lifegrip etc.
---
Tell me more about how I never played on a PvP server in Vanilla. I like this story.
---
Seems similar to me too - same group of friends - we are all a bit more experienced and efficient. I guess there are more ridiculous spell-cleave groups running around. There's no hard pill to swallow here, so I guess OP can just shove that right up his ass?
---
I've heard pickpocketing BRD is good for rogues. I've seen videos of solo farming the robe of the archemage pattern from LBRS. Maybe you could stealth run dire maul for tomes?
---
Speak for yourselves dudes/dudettes. I’m level 37 and have been having a blast just cruising and enjoying partying with other players. Most all people I’ve partied with have been fun to play with and the people who are just leveling and enjoying the game. Maybe the ‘wave’ of players that you’re in are, as a majority, more interested in treating classic like it’s a chance to prove how good they are now.
---
I'd recommend doing that before you reroll.  I had a 60 priest following me around for heals and dispels lastnight and it was an absolute fcking blast.  Between dispels, grounding/tremor and shocks you are pretty much a god vs any caster.  Those sweet sweet WF procs keep me coming back for more.
---
My gear isnt even that good yet, still wearing leather pieces like a n00b :P
---
/doubt
---
And if you need gold that bad you're off doing one of the *many* farms that will net you a ton of gold per hour. The "drop in the bucket" is whatever you get for the epic world drop you yanked away from someone who would have loved to actually get and use it.
---
It's all accurate. I hid behind the "no mic" thing for YEARS. My guild leader knew, though, and never put me on blast or even mentioned it. He taught me how to heal in a raid environment, in fact; I wish I could remember his name.
---
How dare you not enjoy being ignorant and consequently making horrible, ill-informed decisions.
---
I'd say he's not wrong but he's not right. I'd probably pass on it, but I can see them needing it. To be fair not everyone is following the steps by step BiS guides online and just roll on whatever they think is an upgrade at the time. I remember having that mask on a mage in vanilla, upgrades are upgrades even if it benefits you more.
---
Though much more annoying at lvl 60 and better gear isnt right around the corner.
---
43 isnt much to lose, i rerolled at 60 and it wasnt a big deal.
---
They need to destroy the recount add ons too. That way they don't damage shame us lower geared players
---
When anybody says "xyz is strong in pvp" they mean BGs. Nothing else matters, cause duels are rock-paper-scissor and world pvp is about merely about having more bodies on your side.
---
Just think about ele shamans: do totems matter at all in world pvp? Is chain lightning good aoe when there are 40 people on the other side? Will the enemy even notice you purging off their buffs when they die in 0,2 seconds anyway? Is your single-target heal going to be noticed? The answer to all of those questions is no if you're talking about open world pvp.
---
If you play in smaller groups however the shaman suddenly shines. You wont deal quite as much damage as mages, but you make up for it with a ton of utility. All of your totems are useful in certain situations, you can pocket-heal a bit if your healer is CCd or otherwise locked out of casting and your purge is an amazing tool to stop the enemy flag carrier. All in all shaman is very fun to play, because you can very easily tell the difference between an okay shaman and a great shaman because you will probably use a few dozen different skills in every single fight.
---
Spy add-on. Run and hide when you hear them coming.
---
You don't have to even insist, for I believe you.
---
Let me say that it was definitely during The Burning Crusade that I've seen probably the most of all the possible marriage and otherwise regular people, turn into utter no-lifers, from World of Warcraft. I remember the GM and most of the officers took a week off(maybe it was two) during the launch of BC in order to get a jump on levelling to 70.
---
It was at some point past the Tempest Keep raid where we lost one of our main tanks due to an extremely heated blow up guild meeting on Ventrilo(ohh the days). His gf was someone I knew to be very careful of(rumors around the grapevine was that she was sleeping around). She, under the guise of asking me for druid healing advice(I was the class officer for the time), turned into a bit of a creepy thing where she would be all praising and trying to stroke my ego on how awesome I was.
---
I stuck to keeping things professional and her at arm's length, I just didn't want to get involved.
---
I came here for this. You know they also ran the boat looking for the source too.
---
15g is quite a bounty if you happen to stumble upon him and put him in the dirt.
---
Where do I find a best sloot
---
I mean I just burn through water because I drink after every almost pull even if it's just to get a little bit of mana while the tank starts getting threat on the next pack of mobs. That way I'm keeping my mana at a reasonable level without making the group wait. Just costs some gold on my part to keep my water stacks full if there's no mage around. No group should be waiting on a spriest to drink *to full* after every pull.
---
I also always keep potions / runes on me for those longer fights where the group accidentally pulls more than intended.
---
Playing spriest just means you have to be prepared with mana consumables and also manage your mana well while in combat.
---
Oooh, a frost surviving bullahit that would 100-0 every other class in the game.
---
bro im begging u to delete this lol
---
Whenever a player enters your range of sight the game needs to constantly calculate whether you are in range of that target or not for purposes of allowing you to use abilities. This is just a guess, but I feel like this might be the process Spy is using to identify nearby players.
---
&gt; in TBC you roflstomp all tier 4 content, farm daily quests, your daily heroics, pick up your welfare epics and then you spend all your time AFK in Shattrath getting summoned wherever you need to go.
---
because most are too incompetent to progress through t5 (which exists at launch) since it actually requires a modicum of coordination compared to vanilla where you can faceroll up to the end of AQ.  the AQ patch is where pservers die 
---
really makes you think
---
&gt;the only way to disable it is disabling an API call that hundreds of other addons use
---
What did you mean by this statement then?
---
Youre dreaming if you dont think they eventuallly release "TBC classic" and theyll do the same staggered content release to get more months of subs.
---
Ok good point, next week I'll see about bringing some consumables. I'm MM/Survival, went with survival for pvp/surefooted.
---
One thing I dont like about the auto shot -&gt; aimed roatation. Sometime the mob is already nearing 3/4 health by the time aimed shot casts especially in normal dungeons makes it seem like I'm behind in damage compared to dps. That sucks that we'll phase into support roll booo. Thanks for reply
---
It was 6:30 server time Friday, so prime playing time imo. I’m horde on bigglesworth so slightly horde dominant. I think everyone else has the same perspective from just their server too.
---
Private servers have also proven that TBC is a failure, they twindle after the initial hype when people just shitstomp everything, and are stuck doing dailies/hcs waiting 6 months for BT or Sunwell to be released.
---
Vanilla has longetivity because its an inherently slow game, TBC has good raid progression structure, sure. But the rest of the game is almost as rotten as retail.
---
He's currently camping Burning Steppes flight master. No need to actively search for him. He's staying in the area as long as no one his level shows up. I'm assuming he might stick around for a 1 lvl 60 Alliance player but as soon as he sees that it's not at a minimum 5v1 ratio he's going to run like nobody's business.
---
You can also do that with a lvl 5 bank alt.
---
There, there little one. They can’t hurt you now. Drink as long as you like. If that rogue gives you shit I’m bouncing his ass. Shhhhhh, it’s okay now.
---
Grind honor, sure. Get into BRM/DM without death hopping the whole way? Not so much.
---
I have always hated surprises so works for me:)
---
I agree with you. The side that's losing will start premading PvP WSG or AB and abandon World PvP. Meaning, wPvP will get even worse for the already losing side. 
---
Not sure what Blizzard needs to do, but every day this continues, I fear more players will quit. I almost think the idea of a faction transfer is starting to make sense. People don't want to leave the server they are on in fear of it becoming a dead server, but people faction changing to kill their previous allies might be a fairly decent solution.
---
yeah make A/H ratios public, that's a fucking genius move if you want to make the faction ratios even worse. 
---
Only solution is faction queues at 60/40 and they needed to be in 2 months ago
---
All of which is visible in the combat log..
---
So depending on your stance it snags the specific spell rather than having 3 bindings. Got it
---
Lol yea. I’m getting a lot of repeat dungeon runs. Used to be one and done. Now everyone wants to go again.
---
mind vision has a 100 yard range tho
---
The last time I healed on my druid with 2 feral druid DPS, I didn't receive a single innervate through the entire dungeon, and the one time either of them went into bear form, they were already dead... Definitely no heals were cast from either, even between pulls.  
---
Sadly a lot of people that play feral dps "only dps" and don't really do anything else for the most part.
---
Here's the problem, payers wanted classic because it was a chance to play vanilla again.  They bitch and complain about getting the game as close as possible to vanilla.  Then they complain about vanilla aspects of the game.  They weren't complaining about having servers able to handle huge populations UNTIL the idea of pvp set in.  Blizzard said they were full and stop making characters, but people kept doing it because they want to be on massive servers.  Blizzard gave people chances to transfer away, but they remain.  Blizzard had layering in the make it easier to level, and people complained about layers.
---
Do people want vanilla or not?
---
The nostalgia people have for vanilla needs to die.  Classic is a pretty goddamned close example of it vanilla and the major difference is that the players mostly know exactly what they want to do and how to do it.  That wouldn't change no matter how much closer to vanilla the game could possibly be.  The reality is that too many people had no goddamned idea what vanilla actually was and built it up to be this magical glorious thing.  It isn't.  The game was buggy and raw.  I see complaints all the time about feign and vanish being bugged and I honestly have no idea if it's a classic bug or not because those two were always fucky during vanilla.  People think vanilla was some refined age when things were better, but it isn't.  There was never this time period were people could raid however they wanted or wear random gear.  The only reason it happened was because we were all dumb as rocks and didn't know the best way to do things.
---
If people are going to quit over this, then they were going to stick around anyway.  This is pretty damn close to vanilla.
---
Yeah, there's always at least one "AKSHUALLY" guy isn't there? :P
---
I mean they are still paying their subs and you dont even make new content for them, seems like a big win for blizzard.
---
hmm not sure how that would work out playing on PC. I have gotten head while doing so though.
---
Doesn't bubble get rid of the poison too
---
I mean I never think hunters will hold me back, but I tend to want a mage or warlock when I'm going for emp for example because the lyceum is pretty annoying without fast aoe.  
---
Or when you have a warrior tank, and get messages by 15 fury warriors and nothing else.  I don't want a 4 warrior party, they probably dont want it either with the loot competition.
---
At launch there were too many casters, now it seems everyone is lvling nothing but warriors.
---
You made the right choice, if you had rolled pvp you would be upset. There are a lot of folks who made the wrong choice, they should have rolled pve but they didn't. Now they want to change the game because they can't go back in time and change their decision.
---
Well he's saying he's tanking as ret but has enough prot to get hit but also has consec (according to you) so I'm just wondering where the ret part comes in.
---
Seems more hybrid than anything.
---
You can downvote next all you want, does not change the fact that a feral Druid dps is basically dead weight in groups who know what they are doing. Downvoting and dissing won’t all of a sudden make you do more damage.
---
lets say  you have a job and only make minimum wage which is like \~$10 an hour, you dont think you could save 2-3 hours worth of game time to offset the cost of transfer? but you are right there is a payment required.
---
damn right lol. 
---
and yes we are still married
---
Both pictures are relevant for wow....
---
This is my mains face and he is a ginger. Got BF Helm last night and while super happy part of me is sad I dont get to see these pretty eyes peeking over my mask of the unforgiven.
---
Surprised to not see more mages. But mages are the best classes, minimal zeppelin rides, free food/water, ability to kill 12 enemies at a time while other struggle with two, fun pvp duel kit and who doesnt love a pyro, PoM/pyro from left field. Class is the best.
---
he has 2 accounts so he can make one on a separate account on the same server
---
This is a lie, there were BIS lists in Vanilla, they weren't followed as closely or as wide spread though.
---
"When"?
---
What did you expect on a PVP server?  I don't like it any more than most but I rolled PVP and am dealing with it.  You act like you suddenly realized people might gank you on a PVP server.
---
It's not Blizzard's fault you didn't think that far ahead.
---
Sounds like how you play me personally I was never a raid logger and while not a huge fan of welfare epics. With that said  t4 was my endgame at the time. because of skill level and time investment but your delusional to think people haven’t already hit that wall in classic with the two raids available. I’ve seen one Druid pull 6/8 t1 from a single MC clear. Personally other than raid gear I haven’t personally needed dungeons for the last month but I do them daily because I enjoy them.
---
You were like Chunk in the Goonies.
---
I am pretty sure horde out numbered alliance in vanilla on most servers. Really unsure why you think it was any different back then.
---
Did you even play? Everyone knew what a rotation was lol. People may not have been good at it but they knew they were meant to use a rotation and the word was commonly used.
---
Wrath had the biggest playerbase, but the game’s design still left a lot to be desired (S5 DK+two other sapient beings cleave lol). This is a controversial opinion to have in a community that runs on 91 octane nostalgia, but arena’s game design has improved every expansion since it came out, except Warlords.
---
I'm the one being dishonest? I mentioned that BGs ensured fair*-ish* fights (as far as numbers are concerned, anyways), that other guy mentioned "grass is always greener" and you inferred that I was the one missing the point...
---
The point wasn't that either faction takes advantage of being numerically superior in any given skirmish or even in global population, the point was that numerical advantage is irrelevant to BGs, hence it is where we'll see which faction is the best.
---
"Grass is always greener" would apply if you had a post from Alliance saying Horde is better at PvP and a similar post from Horde saying Alliance is better at PvP, which doesn't seem to be what anyone is saying, here. Horde is in superior number on PvP servers, that's a simple and obvious fact. This leads to them more often engaging in fights where they have a numerical advantage, that's also a very simple and obvious fact.
---
Can you use both at the same time?
---
After reading all your comments about this topic, i'm fairly certain the reason people don't bring you to groups is more because of your cunty attitude and use of emojis, than because you play balance.
---
I remember when my guild was mostly in the high 30s and maybe a low 40 we were doing a 4x war 1 healer run of arm because someone wanted the axe. Healer went to sleep early and no others were online so we just 4 war'd it. Took about 2 hours from all the food breaks but man that shit was fun.
---
Add-ons were a mistake. They've fundamentally broken the balance of the game over the years. They also give a giant advantage to hardcore players who already benefit from their greater knowledge. They aren't just better, their version of the game is easier.
---
Oh those were exactly the things I told myself back when, and are the same things I tell myself even now, when I overhear screaming spouses and children crying, all of which are directed at the person neglecting them over playing the game.
---
The thing is, you need this person to keep doing what they're doing. In experience they're a crucial role, be it the GM, one of the guild's main tanks, class officers, etc etc.
---
When it's up to balancing their life outside the game, that's just up to them to do. Easy to say, hard to do, and I'd like to think things are different today compared to 15 years ago.
---
They are different now. I'm sure they are.
---
30.00 is 2 months of game time, or for some a weeks worth of food.  All I am saying is that free xfers always lead to money spent, regardless.
---
Yeah all 3 stack, and you can even get Annihilator's debuff to stack on top of those
---
Sure, but a multi-boxer shouldn't be earning the same as a solo player. 60g is what I can earn running DME solo. If that's all he's getting for summoning, that's terrible.
---
I actually have no clue tbh but even then they're not that hard to beat.
---
Escorts should always run slightly slower than your normal speed. The user shouldn’t feel like their time is being wasted. But they should always be able to catch up to the guy they’re escorting if they fall behind.
---
Man, I sure wish I knew Heartseeker would be 15% Horde when the server released.
---
if u wanted a pve server then u shuldve rolled on one. theyre not going to change the game for you.
---
How is this an unpopular opinion?
---
True enough but for a 100% pve specced and geared healer it's a lot nicer to just do Hillsbrad while watching YouTube instead of trying to organize party sized gank squads.
---
 And are you well in the suffering?
---
Horde mats until they merge servers, offer xfers, or you start hitting AQ/Naxx where guilds will want those for progression. MC is pretty faceroll, and the guilds struggling with it are definitely not the kinda players who can/will throw money at consumes every week.
---
Lotuses are hitting like 75g on my server.
---
This speaks to me on so many levels
---
As a rogue go enchanting simply for being able to disenchant blues from your stealth runs through low lvl dungeons
---
RealMobHealth v2.13
---
All the warriors don't want to tank though.  They are all fury dps.  My friend *did* roll war to tank though, and I went priest to heal.  Still have trouble filling DPS slots sometimes.  Or at least, a balanced party.
---
Good evening! Hopefully you can find some of my advice useful and non-repetitive of previous comments. I'm one of our main healers in our horde guilds raiding group, and have picked up some nuggets of info along the way.
---
The first thing to consider as a raid heal leader is the composition of your raid. How many healers do you need? Are they well geared? Are the tanks well geared? Is there enough diversity in the heals being cast that every role is being filled? While it varies from week to week, our raid typically has 5 holy priests, 2 resto shamans, and 2 resto druids. Like I said this varies based on availability. People have already covered sorting the healers into different groups so I won't harp on that. 
---
Next thing I'll talk on is assigning certain abilities such as soulstones, invennerates, and ankhs so their cooldowns are used efficiently. At least one soulstone should be on the main tank and the main healer at all times. The druids should know who they are innervating and when. They should be innervating the main priest healer. Sometimes in may work best to have 2 innervates (at different times) on the SAME healer, in fights such as rag when only one or 2 priest healers are able to reach to main tank. I like to use the "buddy system" with priests and druids. P1 pairs with D1 and P2 with D2. Let them talk it out among themselves when an innervate should be used (first time priest drops below 20% Mana? Second time? Will they use a potion, rune, or trinkets to help their Mana? When would the innervate best be used?)
---
Next tip is for priests, but really for healers who use HoTs that will not stack. Determine which healer has the strongest throughput and allow them (and only them!) To use renew on the tanks. Since multiple renews cannot be applied to the same target, it is best to allow the strongest one to always be up on the tanks. This way, not every preist is trying to apply renews only to get the "a more powerful effect is already active" notification. This allows other priests to not have to worry about applying renew to the main tank, and focus on other spells and party members to increase activity time. 
---
The last thing id recommend is paying attention to  not only to who are the top on the healing meters, but what heals are they using and who are their targets? Heal meters are not always a good indicator of who's a good healer. A less experienced and undergeared priest can do well on the meters by raid healing, and sniping heals with flash heal. Your best healer may not have the highest numbers because they are focused on just one or two raid members, conserving Mana and timing their heals to prevent overheal. The strongest, smartest, and most efficient healer you have may not have a staggering HPS. I use the details addon, and it lets me see what heals are being used and which targets they are used on. This is especially useful for a raid heal leader so they can better monitor where their fellow healers are focusing. It can be used to help identify problems the raid may face and how to solve them. (ie, healer 3 was supposed to be focusing heals on tank 3, but the majority of their heals went to tank 1, and tank 3 died). 
---
The final thing I'll talk about is minimizing your raids overhealing. Overhealing is directly inefficient to your raid, albeit its a good problem to have vs no healing. Making sure healers are managing their resources appropriately will make all of the difference in how smooth a raid will be. A lot of times I'll see healers trying to save the entire raid by spamming greater heals, trying to fill up the tanks health all by themselves. Discourage this behavior. I prefer lots and lots of smaller heals vs a few big heals. Teach downranking (my rank 2 heal is probably my most used heal because for my healpower, it's arguably the most efficient heal in terms of being able to constantly have it ready, applying a viable heal, and to decrease overhealing). 
---
This isn't an exhaustive list of everything you should know, but thought I'd jot down some ideas that came to my head as I'm bored at work waiting to get online after. Hope this helps and good luck!
---
Couldn't you use the functionality of spy to create an similar functionality?
---
I asked a question to learn more, saying 'it doesn't matter knowing why you can't do it' isn't very helpful
---
Hi, /u/LaaDeeDa

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dya080/in_2005_and_onwards_howd_you_live_your_life/).

I just rolled to pve.
---
I have lvl60 ally mage @ flamelash eu , that i dont even like to play with. 
---
So it was easy decision to roll pve for safe leveling.
---
I laughed because my ass would have done the same shit
---
At the time I was saying shit like "thanks so much, this really helped me out". And he was like "np, glad to hear it". 
---
And then today he was like "I thought it was kind of weird what you were saying before but didn't say anything". At the time he thought I was making a big deal out of 70 silver, thinking I must have been really poor somehow, lol.
---
How did they fall on their face? You realize this is exactly how vanilla released back in the day right?
---
WoW is too mainstream, I think, for that type of person. WoW is the CoD of mmos lol
---
Have you ever run spell cleave though? It's actually ridiculous. You clear like 10 times faster, Mages are that OP. I just levelled mine to 58 and I've never experienced getting a level an hour in the 50's before. So while it seems silly to spend time looking for a specific comp, if you haven't tried it maybe you should. Most dungeons you run people leave after 1 or 2 and you spend 1-2 hours to clear and barely get anything out of it. If I'm going to dedicate many hours to levelling in a dungeon I am going to take some extra time to make sure the comp is good and people aren't going to want to leave after 1 run because it took half their day.
---
A couple more weeks would have made a difference. Poll here from a couple weeks back showed most in the mid 40s to mid 50s
---
I've never once seen anyone require level 60 for BRD.
---
Don't you ever do that again. From on, you are to have 1 warrior, 1 rogue, 1 mage, 1 priest, and 1 warlock. No other variation is acceptable. Do I make myself clear?
---
After the first year PvP was a problem.  This wasn't because of the ruleset though, rather because the devs didn't (or couldn't) make changes as problems were discovered.   
---
Hacks and exploits like the "new player's gold" hack allowed gangs to get essentially infinite resources.  There were no mechanisms in place to form groups, guilds or even talk further than one screen away.   These gangs were often just one or two people since you could "multi-box" with just one account.
---
Pvp is fun, 40 people camping low levels isn't fun.
---
&gt; this discussion has no right answer regardless of the gatekeepers on here.
---
Think what you want of the people on this subreddit, but if you make players DKs then it becomes ridiculously easy to grief other people by running a low level alt into pvp combat. 
---
This isn't even close to being a matter of there being no objectively true answer. If anyone thinks about this proposition for even 5 seconds they should be able to understand that this is a hilariously terrible idea that would kill PvP in the game. It has literally zero chance of ever happening.
---
&gt;Getting ganked by gangs of level 60s when I'm trying to level up in 30 areas is just shit and shouldn't be allowed to happen.
---
You opted in to this experience by selecting a PvP server. No one has ever played on a PvP server and *not* been ganked. You knew this was part of the experience when you selected a PvP server. You're playing in the middle of the street and complaining that all these cars keep driving by you.
---
Sure it's frustrating and I can empathize with that but nothing in the game needs to change.
---
&gt;Allow low levels to quest and pvp people in their own level range without fear of just getting blindsided, one shot and forced to run 10 minutes from the graveyard every 90 seconds.
---
They do this already. They're called PvE servers.
---
&gt;Cue downvotes "roll pve" and general abuse for daring to criticise classic.
---
You're asking for a PvE server and getting upset when people tell you to play on a PvE server. I don't understand what you want. Do you even know what you want? A special server just for you where you're the only person who's allowed to initiate combat because you like to gank people but can't handle getting ganked yourself?
---
Yep. With the talent each crit gets me 5 rage. Swipe hits 3, it costs 15 rage. If all 3 crit, free Swipe. 
---
I tab/swap enemies constantly to make sure I swipe all of them. I generally hold agro well. If not I just taunt it off, Maul it and I should have agro again. 
---
Mage AOE can pull it off me through. If they open too soon they will die.
---
Tards like this arent even the problem. Buying out an entire market and relisting a custom price doesn't work on these servers because of how double full the servers are...theres too much supplies coming into the game, no matter what you're gonna get undercut before anyones able to buy your shit.
---
Feral druids can 1v1 mages much better than rogues, move around the map faster and escape groups.
---
Rogues are nice, but they are much squishier when caught.
---
Yes, it will give you a new one when you ask it to
---
I'm pretty sure hes making a joke about how mages eat warriors in most normal circumstances and it flew right over your head.
---
Replying again so you get the notification. I've just added together all the times, and 52-60 took me 76.854 hours. 
---
The rough hour breakdown was:
---
52-53 = 8 hours
---
53-54 = 15 hours (I leveled herbalism 1-260 here or something)
---
54-55 = 7 hours
---
55-56 = 8 hours
---
56-57 = 8 hours
---
57-58 = 9 hours
---
58-59 = 9 hours
---
59-60 = 9 hours
---
And the rest of the time remaining was in minutes. I've rounded down in all cases, but the 76.854 is exact to the second.
---
I have saw this happen a few times with my buddy on his epic Undead mount.
---
Also... Whitemane represent?
---
It's far more than that. These numbers are outdated (because the census addon was broken), but at the time of census, in September, only 2 NA servers had under 10k population, and the majority of NA servers had *more than 50k*. That's far more than 10x the original server caps. [Source](https://classic.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=295075.1#p4380414).
---
It definitely would, as someone who plays on a server that's massively imbalanced, you can't even walk to BRM without getting ganked by 15-25 people in a group.
---
I've always wanted BGs. World PvP CAN be fun under a very specific set of circumstances, but I have no idea why so many people were pining for it and thought it was going to be amazing or something.
---
Good looking girls will ofc get offers. Hell I would offer her a job as well. Who would not?
---
nah bruh, this why you ask 'hey what ya in here for' at the start, to anyone who might compete for what you want. If you or they have been spamming the dungeon for just one thing, its easy to say 'ah nice, yeah its yours if that drops'
---
socialize you motherfuckers
---
3-4 warriors and a healer is the only other "meta" comp besides spell cleave for dungeon grinding lol.
---
why did you equip freezing band to a paladin
---
I also downloaded spy recently. Yeah, it’s useful, but I wish it didn’t exist. This is one I think blizz should block somehow.
---
I played vanilla and no, no it wasn't... mainly because the server populations weren't nearly as high as they are now... so the whole, let's get rid of layering and the same week release honor kills was a fucking terrible idea. Game is literally unplayable right now.
---
There are only six pools in azshara that work for this, they have long respawn times, and they're constantly farmed. Anyone who levels up fishing for this on a server that isn't dead is going to regret it.
---
Peak of 10m players even 1% is 100,000 players. I'd imagine the number of even semi successful Guilds/GMs in 15 years isnt as unreasonable as it sounds.
---
Am I wrong here or is this already a thing?
---
I mean none of what you just said is really relevant at all to what I said. There are more meaningful talent choices in retail right now than classic ever had. Even if you don't like the way they handle it there are still more choices in retail. Again, I prefer classic, but to say that retail has less player choice in talents is just flat wrong.
---
Just because it’s not a lot of mama doesn’t mean it’s not worth holding off on it. In a game that things increase by 1% or half a second at a time for some abilities I’m not sure why this concept would be lost on you.
---
That’s hotw druids, not a feral cat Druid.
---
Probably because warriors are favoured alts, because you can buy good gear for him to leveling, making it more easier than the main-warrior leveling.
---
wait I'm new to the game but I'm pretty sure my guild was doing test of skulls with like 4-5ppl max...are you talking about something different?
---
That’s the thing about our personal oppinions we don’t know unless they put it out there. Personally I prefer the staticness classic can offer to a player ie classic wow is it’s on thing in the future a classic BC would be it’s on thing.   something I can play until I’m content and put it down. Retail currently has implemented seasons into their gameplay with an ever moving carrot. Grinds that are mandatory sure world quest are easy. I just find it more satisfying to knock out dungeons for hours in classic vs going to retail to do my chore list for the week or day. Both BC and Vanilla you play the game in retail you play the patch. It’s not fun when the treadmill never stops imo and that’s why I prefer the older iterations.
---
It’s not radar lmao
---
&gt; People arriving at flight paths give no honor fyi.
---
Sure, but then you die and the debuff falls off, and when you rez, you're worth honor. They kill you right away to pin you down so that they can corpse-camp you and farm honor.
---
Just attempted to turn in quests at morgan's vigil for the 3rd time this week, but this guy and his pals killed all the NPCs so i just bubble hearthed and logged. He didn't care for that. PS, you don't get honor for people that just landed dummy!
---

you do you boo.
---
Wow. Why such an aggressive response and downvote for stating facts? My point was that in **most** cases on **most** servers, horde vastly outnumber alliance and therefore alliance experience much more griefing and camping than horde players do. Notice I never said horde players don't get killed too.  Just because you have been killed by alliance groups doesn't mean 30/70 servers don't exist dude. I think you're the one with the victim complex here. How quickly did the horde on your server retaliate with twice the numbers and steamroll those alliance groups? Maybe try asking some alliance players on your servers how many hours they've been camped or griefed by horde. I bet it's not as even as you think.
---
And before you call me salty, I actually have had it pretty easy all things considered since Thursday. Yes, I've gotten killed and been camped, but not nearly as much as others. I've even been able to quest next to a few horde without getting jumped. However, I'm not delusional enough to think that's the norm. My server has better faction balance than most.
---
If it tracks the combat log how can they see you when you come to the zone and dont cast anything?  Or when you Rez it insta pings them that I rezzed
---
After the mass exodus Skeram alliance feels worse than 5/1 horde/alliance.
---
I liked cata pre legendary daggers. That's prob the best time for 3's.
---
TSG with 2x shadowmourne is a bullshit comp - change my mind.
---
Another flight. Still bored. This one is 14 hours, I know you live on here so perhaps we can have a long conversation. 
---
How is life? Why tell me to get a life? Very rude! I have a very busy life, but I make time for you.
---
This is already a thing. After 4 kills they're doing it for sport.
---
You already get a 25% honor decay each time you kill the same person between some amount of time (I believe 24 hours) so this is literally already a thing.
---
Once the game started dying, they didn't do it for the first 6 years.
---
Hahaha
---
That beer part is 100% me.
---
Those skips are all possible with a member of the party at level *54*. I know, because I have run it as a 54.
---
I rolled on med pop RP-PvP server and never looked back
---
Idk - 900g was a fuck ton of gold back then by my recollection. I also rerolled on new servers a lot (seemed like the thing to do back then), so maybe that had something to do with it. Fresh economy and such.
---
You can do it with 4 to 5 people for the PVE content. We did it with 25 for the PVP content.
---
You should look into BRD pick pocket stealth runs, 3 man DM north stealth runs, or get mining and hit up the caves in silithus for thorium/arcane crystals. 
---
Thanks me later.
---
Probably in that waiting an extra 5 mins after each wipe on top of the corpse run is my idea of a waste of time
---
I’m guessing he just had down to consecration in the holy tree and just the hit talent in prot so that would be 11/8 in holy/prot then the rest in Ret I’m assuming.
---
I always see this argument. "You can't kill spy cause it'll kill everything else!!!!"
---
You seriously think a multi-billion dollar corporation can't figure out how to solve this?
---
Bgs is going to be 1 side with randoms against a premade group who will farm you for honor.
---
If I remember right, spy uses combat data which can be used normally to see who is doing what around you... blizzard cant out right ban the mod because it would just cause someone to make it again. However putting a work around in the code will break multiple things people rely on, like DBM.
---
Its used in Path of Exile and Dark Souls as well.
---
Why did they roll on a pvp server?
---
There is diminishing returns on killing the same target.
---
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/23221132/wow-classic-world-bosses-and-pvp-honor-system-available
---
Diminishing Returns from repeated kills on a single target are as follows:
---
1st: 100% of Honor
---
2nd: 75% of Honor
---
3rd: 50% of Honor
---
4th: 25% of Honor
---
5th (and beyond): 0% Honor
---
Its not gonna stop camping
---
Then don't get into the hottest hot zone in Azeroth??
---
&gt; This isnt blizzard's fault.
---
Raising the pop cap 5x wasn't their fault? Really?
---
A level 60 doesn't need to quest.
---
At least they’re replying. A lot of times I whisper someone and they straight up just don’t reply if they don’t need me.
---
You’re not wrong, you stop getting honor after having killed the same person 5 times, I think it is?
---
Problem with SP is you have no AoE but you have to drink as often as a Mage who kills 10 things as quickly as 1. So people will always wonder why should I bring a SP if I could get a Mage and be considerably faster. You can res and spot heal which is the only real difference but the Mage also has many other benefits a Priest doesn't, primarily that you won't need spot healing because everything dies much faster.
---
shadow focus is the one you need. generally shadow leveling builds have 3/5 shadow focus (with 2/2 imp. sw:p), unless you went with shadow affinity for some reason.
---
Realm mergers didn't happen until after WotLK lol.
---
Sure, if you only plan to play wow classic for 30 days then go over to cod 19.  If you plan to play wow classic for 90 days or 180 days, then 5-6 played days is a small amount of time.  He doesn't even have to delete his character to play on the new server.  It will still be there waiting for him to ever come back and dust it off again.
---
My server in vanilla was Horde outnumbering Alliance.
---
It is Blizzard's fault that they chose to release Classic with 10x more server capacity than Vanilla had.  It's not hard to figure out what that does.
---
You take the same physical map, same size map as 3000 players (for example) played on in Vanilla for instance and then you instead drop 30,000 players on the same map.  That means there is literally no where to go for questing... too many people everywhere.  Back in Classic with server sizes the PVP was much more spread out.  Just because they had the technology to allow servers to handle more players doesn't mean they should have done it.
---
Illumination is the most broken talent in the game. At 5 ranks 100% Chance to recover all Mana spent when you crit with your heals. Just spam low level spells. You never lose Mana. It's ridiculous.
---
I use this one as well, super useful.
---
we use a spreadsheet as well
---
i am sure some of those 40 people ganking are having fun, stop thinking about yourself for a moment and consider other people's feelings
---
The ret comment was a joke...
---
Question from a 59 feral tank. How important is insect swarm? Is it really worth not having Leader of the Pack?
---
Go back to wow forums,  nobody wants you here
---
Yea I didn’t like the system in BFA at all much for a bunch of reasons but the idea that it doesn’t give far more choices than classic is hilarious.
---
Chances aren't high, but I think she at least has the face structure for it.
---
don't tell them PepeLaugh
---
There's no good way to do it. Spy just scours the combat log, and pulls enemy player's names and essentially just makes a /tar macro when you click the name. Focus involves pulling HP, mana, and current buff/debuff info as well as target of target, which isn't in the combat log. That's why no one has done it yet, there's no way to get that info.
---
Boy, you guys look back at vanilla with some serious rose colored glasses. This is as close an approximation to a 15 year old game and culture that you could even reasonably expect. I’m constantly shocked at the verisimilitude. And I have time to play now, unlike back then, because I don’t have school or a shared family computer. Complain all you want, but Blizz did pretty well here.
---
There are links here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow (See the dev watercoolers)
---
I'm 58 and I can't wait to start running DM to get my good loot.
---
Problem is....how far does blizzard wants the playerbase spread out? When will they stop? Gonna re-release all expansions? Or just tbc? When I hear ppl talk about good expansions there is a big peak on wrath. But that’s because of the story of arthas, and not because of gameplay etc.
---
Every discussion I’ve seen about Nightfall boils down to “give it to the Hunter for Wing Clip spam.” No one seems to care about the weapon, just the proc.
---
I thought Annihilator’s Armor Shatter proc would prevent a warrior from Sundering? If not, then that is pretty handy, although it eats up a debuff slot that could arguably be better served by something else.
---
It does kind of suck that you have to go out of your way to find a decent axe while raiding when the game practically showers you with swords. I can name half a dozen swords off the top of my head without trying for both DPS and tank specs, but Boneslicing Hatchet, Annihilator, and Nightfall are the only relevant axes I know of.
---
Right now, yes.  Back in Vanilla monsters will have a "detecter" icon light up above their heads once you go into stealth to let you know which ones can detect stealth.
---
\+1. One of the very first I download.
---
Gank implies they have an unfair advantage, be it gear, level, numbers.
---
There were no levels in UO and the rules made it such that the aggressor was at a gear disadvantage because they were likely to losing everything on them.  It's a different mind-set.  
---
People rarely carried much outside of the city/dungeon and the map was massive, so gangs roaming for a victim were not profitable.... until the map was filled with homes that you could sneak into or kill the player frantically running away with a house key.
---
Until the exploits got bad, it was a nice setup.
---
I always wait a month or so after a game gets released to play it. Sure im late to the party, but it saves me from stuff like that. Just dodged the RD2 bullet, too.
---
Polymorph: Turtle or riot!
---
Well me too but it's effectively the exact same thing. Why would I complicate my post by explaining something that no one but a feral druid would care about?
---
I know how to tank, I spent from 58 until well after 60 tanking to get the DPS gear I have now.  My guild asked me to go ahead and spec fury for raids.  Even as prot, it was extremely difficult to find groups.  The core of my post is:  I'm really looking for a group of people to play consistently with, not that I'd love to gear out a warrior by pugging.
---
You get back your deposit if you sell it, though the AH takes a 5?% cut.  
---
So 1g15s is still worth it to sell, assuming it does sell.  
---
Unless you mean the bid, then yeah its silly to put the bid under 1g05s
---
Stop zergjng
---
There could be a time limit. Or more than one NPC to escort. Or respawning enemies to make afking unsuitable.
---
Good thing you decide what is boring for him
---
I'm not only thinking about myself, they're sitting in level 48-55 areas killing people who cant fight back and camping them to the point of them having to sit in main cities. Yesterday it took me 2 hours to get to brf from thorium point because I was getting mc'd back so i couldnt get away.
---
If you scroll through, people are suggesting layering to fix overwhelming numbers of pvp. Sorry you dont feel like they are related, but respect your opinion!
---
First two are savage af lol
---
Which is why if you look further up in this post you’ll see me posting that personally a new fear for me is that we will never have a stand-alone “classic” version of those expansions.  it seems blizzard wants leveling to become a choose your own adventure and those two expansion packs would be part of that choice. That’s what I’ve befun to think anyways since the shadowlands announcement.
---
Right!
---
make a mouse / keyboard macro
---
At least someone got the joke.
---
For more than I'd like to admit, I thought: 
---
"Why the hell is this dude posting this? He's going to get shredded in the comments."  
---
...congrats.
---
Could you potentially create an add-on that makes a /tar macro activated on holding shift for your abilities. From there the add-on has a way you can change out the player's name for all of those macro's.
---
Sure, you're not pulling HP / mana / current buff / debuff info, but you can use raid frames for that information. But the main thing for me is the ability to hold shift or alt and have my heal apply to my focus.
---
Inc "pvp in classic sucks" post.
---
I just use A and D to strafe, mouse wheel tilt right or double mouse click for auto run, and abilities bound to QWERFCVB as well as shift+same keys
---
Before I learned how much better the QoL was on the horde side my character options were being a human in a fantasy game, being a dwarf, being a shorter dwarf or a badass elf with killer dance moves and sweet jumps. I liked the horde aspects better, night elf was cool, but not good enough to convince me.
---
I use a mmo mouse so i am not a good person to ask,  but consider moving wasd to esdf? opens up more options and is really not that hard to get used to.
---
Greed. 
---
That's really all that's it.
---
Ease of access is really the same. Difference is the people. If you knew what info you wanted you could find it then with the same amount of ease.
---
Now there are more people concerned with BiS lists. This change happened slowly but became really apparent in wrath. It’s now taken over the gaming community. Almost every game now has the same type of lists that can be found via google.
---
Info was always available easily, just had less people wanting the info.
---
I've thought about using my free character transfer to a PvE server. I'll do world PvP when it arises and people want to go at it, but I'm going to do more BGs than World PvP when they are released. I'm not pushing for rank 14. It's so hard to even do much right now outside of just PvP'n, so my alts and such have taken a hit for now.
---
I've been rolling on PvP servers for years and it's obviously never been this crazy, but I think the meta and amount of tryhards in the game nowadays just makes world PvP unbearable unless BGs are out.
---
Why? Just get to 60. You're not sub human because your not 60. You're not inferior to everyone that is 60 irl. So why cling on to a lie to make yourself feel secure?
---
I don’t know why you got downvoted, you just explained the premise of this idea lmao
---
Same bro. Same.
---
They can innervate the healer and off tank if someone accidentally pulls a second group or something. Feral Druids are probably the most clutch class in the game if you know how to use them.
---
I was a tank from 58 until after I hit 60, that's how I got the gear I have now.  My guild asked me to spec DPS for raids.  As I mentioned above, the goal of my post wasn't looking to find advice on how I could pug to get gear.  My main reason for posting is to try to find a group of people I can consistently play with, because that's what's fun for me.
---
That was very informative! Thanks so much, I definitely see these problems in my raid from our run on Thursday, I'll start focusing on it more and offering some constructive criticism.
---
Number*
---
I don't like it either, but it's a must have since it's available... Gotta have any advantage you can get.
---
Hunters can do very good damage in MC. After that it all starts going downhill.
---
I pull around 400dps on singletarget boss fights with full pre bis and no epics. Its not top but decent.
---
Makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain all that. I love Destro and it's sad that I'll have to wait until later phases for it to become viable, but the SM/Ruin spec sounds like it can be fun in the meantime. I'll be playing with a Paladin pocket healer friend of mine, so the survivability should be boosted a little. I didnt think the mere 10% boost from SM would really empower the DoTs that much, but I guess every little bit helps. I do enjoy kiting with Curse of Exhaustion, it is pretty potent especially with Amplify Curse.
---
&gt;Not sure what Blizzard needs to do, but every day this continues, I fear more players will quit.
---
Re-introducing layers would be an easy fix, but I don't think everyone would be happy with that either.
---
Implimenting an artificial que just to piss people off and incentivise them to xfer away might work for some people...but not everyone because they are already locked to those servers due to guild and or friend obligations. 
---
I'm not gonna come home at 7pm just to sit in a 2 hour que again because blizz fucked up. I would just quit. As a lot of people probably would at this point
---
You are the reason that #nochanges exist. Dual spec is a horrible idea for classic. So is getting all ores from one tap.  Classic is meant to be a bit slower-paced, it's not designed for you to zoom around. I think some changes are fine, such as the removal of spellbatching, releasing BGs earlier and some form of dynamic respawns to compensate for the massive populations on realms. But I'm mostly on the #nochanges team because of people like you, and I'm willing to bet that this goes for most people supporting #nochanges.

Yep I would say half of my time is just lfg lol also went with a rouge

I was a tank from 58 until after I hit 60, that's how I got the gear I have now.  But because everyone already has all that gear, nobody in guild wants to do that content now.
---
Exactly. Threat is what bears do.
---
If that's the case dont go primal instincts. You dont need the 15% threat gen /s lol
---
Yes. Yes. Let the hate flow through you.
---
Well people have alts, various levels so even if you have a queue then you have a level imbalance so you just trade one problem for multiple more. People want to play with their friends and you would be stopping that. It doesn't actually incentivize anything because having a 60 character means you're locked in already. On top of the obvious it adds a queue where there isn't one today.
---
Pretty obvious stuff if you consider the idea for even 2 seconds.

I use the keys to walk a lot and r f c 1 2 3 plus shift and crtl variations of those for my abilities.

Not everyone uses vendor price addons. Bad listing due to ignorance.

I did 5 years of fullbody/split workouts then 7 years of CrossFit and this year I am getting back to more strength/strongman focused workouts. My deadlift increased from 445 to 485 lbs in just 10 months at 175 lbs, it was mostly caused that I cut a lot on cardio and focused more on heavy weight and accessory exercises.
---
I will also be moving to new house in 2020 so I am really looking forward for home gym. I used to workout at and it is huge timesaver.
---
I’m having fun.
---
Knew what classes were OP, picked Elemental Shaman.
---
Knew how to level efficiently, instead took a month and 14 days / played.
---
Joined a casual hardcore guild that took the game way too seriously and bummed me out, joined raid 3 of a large guild with mates.
---
Knew my pre- raid BiS inside and out, found a good enough item for each slot and moved on.
---
Knew to save for my 40 mount, spent my gold too often and got it at 52.
---
Same for Epic mount, still don’t have it, but working my way there.
---
Knew phase 2 was coming, PvPd for its own sake instead of grinding honour. 
---
I know I’m a hipster at heart anyway, so take it with a grain of salt, but also as a 28 year old man I know who I am, what I want, and I play towards that. Not interested in picking up a game and min maxing until I burn out anymore. I’ve ruined too many fun experiences that way, as I’m aware of what it takes to get to the top, what that means, looks like, and I don’t want it. 
---
Not denying there’s an urge, my intention with this post is to urge whoever reads it to do what they want, and to stop convincing themselves they want the same things power gamers want. Take a long hard look at who you are, and what conformity is, and see if you’re being honest with yourself or not.

Or I’m just a preachy hipster nerd, either way.

&gt; And moonfire spam is pretty effective.

Compared to what?  Picking a druid to play balance means you're NOT picking something else as well.  I never said that a balance druid can't kill people.  They're weak (compared to the options you're not picking) in group pve and pvp.  If you want to play a 1v1 balance spec for ganking or dueling, go for it.  In my initial statement I said to play it because you want to, not because it's good.  That's exactly what I mean - pick the spec because you absolutely want to play THAT spec.  f
---
Guy comes to reddit asking for advice and everyone wants to blow smoke up his ass, only talking about upsides.  Compared to other options that exist in balance druid space, it's a weaker spec.
---
There isn't much by means of DPS gear, at least for casters. Lots of great healing gear though.
---
&gt; There should have been some sort of incentive for players to balance out the factions such as a faction specific queue. 
---
That's not an incentive, though. That's artificially frustrating a majority of your player base because you made one faction better than the other. If you want more even realms you should incentivize people to play Alliance by making Alliance more appealing, not discourage people from playing Horde but making it more difficult to log-in.
---
If it's any consolation they're not going to keep it up with the 30 man raid teams once the honor calculations complete this week and they realize they've wasted an entire week and now they're behind.
---
It does not exist. An addon has absolutely no way to tell what addons another player has installed unless the other player tells them.

---
The point of the post isn't to gear out my warrior.  The problem I'm having is feeling like I have to pug everything.  Healing, DPSing, tanking.. it's no fun if I don't have a consistent group of people.  I tanked from 58 until well into 60 and that's how I got the DPS gear I have on my warrior now.
---
lol hmmm stuck at lv30-35 for 5 days played or do it in 1 day played
---
Even in raids ferals provide innervate and can off tank. For the most part you could do ony and MC with like 30 competent people. You can afford to take some utility specs.
---
Of course the horde are having fun on pvp servers lmao
---
I watched a paladin on Herod named Pally die 15 times from thorium point to BRD jump. I can completely understand why this dude and people in this situation would want to just stop playing the game, or find a way to solve this. It's just not fun. Shit it's not even fun for me, my group of 5 just runs around and steamrolls people.
---
I was a GM. 
---
It was my bank alts guild but a GM none the less!
---
It's not punishment though it's just random. These Imbalances happen in classic too. Stormrage is 99% alliance. I know because I played on it. 
---
The imbalance wouldn't be messing with gameplay so badly if the server max population was actually what it's supposed to be.
---
I thought they should have released BG's from phase 1. Bg's are a major part of wow and the game is suffering without them. There are games that are balanced for death-ball PVP. ... Wow is not one of them and never was.
---
I like world pvp when everyone is leveling, but having 60's smashing every enemy they can see 24/7 to try and eek out some extra honor is just bad for the game.
---
Thats just it, you can always build a guild like that... Theres nice people everywhere. I will never discount the players going out of there way to build a community.
---
But entire servers used to feel that way. 
---
An overpopulated server makes every individual have less value, because each person can sooner be replaced by someone else. When there are less people online, every warlock, priest, hunter, and warrior becomes more important. Communuties become more closely woven. 
---
Props to your guild for doing it right, though
---
Yes, Im not saying druids do dps similar to top rogues in raids though.  In a dungeon setting druids are very comparable to rogues in terms of dps.
---
The link I provided was to show that feral dps is the top 'meme' spec for dps that isnt shadow priest.
---
I tanked in vanilla and to me at end game all I knew was I needed purples to replace my blues lol (I'm exaggerating a bit, but I didn't use a spreadsheet).
---
My guild is easily clearing MC and Ony, the problem is that most of my gear that's BiS isn't in either of those.  I need to run UBRS, BRD, Strat, Scholo, etc -- and no one wants to run those now.
---
Thanks for all the information. One more thing, does anybody know how to see my level of skinning? When I click on skinning in my spell book, it tries to skin something. With other professions, normally it opens a window where I can see my level.
---
My lvl 49 guildie shadowpriest easily handled 2 man arena runs lol. Just had to do a few extra pulls (and we died a couple of times before he got the pathing down for avoiding the spectators)
---
People are ridiculous
---
Do you have to reset/make the channels every time you enter a new zone?
---
That happens to me and it's somewhat tedious to keep doing it all the time.
---
Yeah people just like to complain, I agree
---
Yea, if you’re lucky you can find geared 60s doing a full clear for rep. I had a dual wield fury warrior tank who just wreaked it.
---
&gt; a feral Druid dps is basically dead weight in groups who know what they are doing. 
---
A group that know that it's doing could be full of the worst race/class/spec combinaison and will still roll over dungeons anyway.
---
Min-maxing for fucking wow classics dungeons is like min-maxing for pokemon.
---
Yeah flying made it super easy to hunt for world pvp. I had lots of great 1v1s back then. I have always played a feral druid and one of my favorite things to do was fly around in bird form looking for pvp flagged horde and then shifting into cat and stealthing in the air so that I land right on top of them for the opener. I love classic but I really do miss my bird form. If they ever did release TBC servers I would be so happy.
---
I hate that shit. 
---
"Let's skip this group" the 60 says
---
Me, the 58, is thinking this is a bad idea and a loss of xp. They want faster runs to get HOJ. They've killed Anger 50 times and they are running out of patience. 
---
Then we wipe.
---
Try Silithus. You can grind the snakes and spiders until you are lv60.
---
How about a level 57 probably has shit gear and can barely hit the boss at the end so why the fuck would I take them? Love how the most obvious option is not listed.
---
I am 99% sure the guy who was Mind controlling you was laughing his ass off and really enjoying his time. good that you were able to make his game time more enjoyable, well done sir, it is just too bad you were not able to play longer then 2 hours (get them numbers up to like 8 hours then come talk to me)
---
The only reason I said anything is because your post makes it seem like anyone in a group with a feral should notice them in and out of elf/tauren form constantly when the only ones doing that are the bad ones who are wasting GCDs.  All someone should see is a puff of smoke and a full energy bar.

Maybe there's others I'm missing but that's the gist of it.
---
Edit: the mobile client is messing up the formatting. I have line breaks but they're not showing.
---
Funny when players think that them having numbers magically makes them a better player.
---
If I got a group of 5 or 10 or 40 and ride around ganking solo and smaller groups it doesn't make me a better player FYI.
---
I'm playing in pagle. It's 75% alliance. Including myself.
---
I played horde in vanilla all the way to just before legion.
---
Wanted the opposite experience.
---
Perhaps many thought asi did and since alliance was more populated then, is the reason horde is more populated now.
---
PlUS imo horde is easier leveling wise
---
RemindMe! 12 hours
---
It's not just that they want a reward, right now there's no other content to do. MC and Ony were far too easy. I don't play hardcore and I started a month late and already I'm at a point where aside from PVP the only other thing to do is log in twice a week for raid nights. So you have a perfect combination of overpopulated servers filled with bored individuals with nothing better to do.
---
I have W A D for movement. I never backpedal, since I turn 90 degrees an strafe to go back. 
---
I play a priest, my buffs are on F keys.
---
My most used abilities are on 1-4, Q E R S F C Z X T.
---
Lesser used abilities on G B.
---
Almost all abilities are macro’d for modifiers with shift + ctrl for down ranking and the likes. 
---
The very lesser used abilities I have not bound; professions, chat macros, targeting (Jed) macros.
---
Mouse scroll down is /target self, mouse button 5 is self dispel, mouse button 4 is auto run
---
In the case of Classic escort quests we really dont.
---
Word. Not sure what my dps was for the single fights i just saw total overall.
---
New question, is it possible to not clip auto shot with aimed shot? Seems like it always does just a bit
---
Idk how else to say it, but you are not stacked. All that stuff you think is awesome will be replaced in 4-5 levels. All that “stacked stuff” can be gotten again with 10 hours of play on a new server. But no matter how many hours of play a dead server will be a dead server.
---
Go to the wow forum. TBC isn't classic is it?
---
Oh yeah that should be doable... I guess the reason it hasn't been done is that it's a little niche. You could do the same thing with macros, but you'd need to change the macro each time you wanted to change focus.
---
If you're using it for healing, have you tried mouseover addons like clique? IMO they remove a lot of the need for focus as an alt cast target.
---
&gt;It’s not world PvP anymore. It’s world ganking. 
---
What do you mean "anymore"? It's always been this way. It's the whole reason I rolled PvE in classic in the first place.
---
Did you play vanilla? There were a fraction of the players on one server. People are way more geared. Way more 60s. This isn't classic PvP. I transferred to earthfury though and it's great now. I was actually on a server where my faction was dominant. Just wasn't fun. To each their own. Still ganking, still raids, just not 4 raids in one zone making any form of PvE besides dungeons unplayable. Whatever. I just don't want to hear any crying when some big servers end up completely one sided becuase the other faction was ran off.
---
You don't use any of the number keys? Also when you say double click for auto run do you mean just pressing left+right click to move forward or actual autorun ?
---
Wow stop thinking about yourself, ever think those people you're spawn camping and mcing so they cant play the game or make any headway arent having fun? Pffft so selfish
---
I have not survived past that room yet.
---
Check out Necropile set from scholo. For pvp you don’t need a lot of +heals/damage as holy. This set is a beast and you should get at least 4/5 of it. Try to have 3,7-4k hp unbuffed.
---
I've been dabbling with all classes in dungeons, and it seems like tanking is hands down the most difficult/involved role. Healing with healbot is a bit whack-a-moley. As is dotting people as lock. While I like lock role okay, was curious what class/role would be 2nd to tank in terms of difficulty. Afraid I just don't have what it takes to be a very good tank.
---
If you ever formed a group you get spammed with whispers. It can be difficult to reply to all

Wrong.

They stated in a post they will not do anything:

They fucked up by allowing Alliance Xfers when there was already a disparity. So yes, it is. And not, it's not random.

lol how do u figure?  if it's a 80/20 split with 2000k people or a 80/20 split with 1000 people it's still an 80/20 split.  Makes zero sense.
---
You lost me at shadowmeld
---
Once you are level 48, you will give honor to level 60s.
---
You probably won't be able to quest in Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes and maybe some other zones depending on your server. Eastern Plaguelands, Felwood might be tough, too.
---
I don't get how you can think griefing other players is a thing that is okay. How ruining another players time or experience is something that should be embraced with open arms.
---
World PvP can and did exist before honor was implemented that was about 95% less griefing.
---
Why not? It's fucking easy all you gotta do is play mage!
---
Sure but thats raids, which is only 1 aspect of the game. for 5 mans wf is insane and the difference between it and not is night and day. For pvp, it turns warriors into a god, not to mention that purge demolishes priests.
---
Kurinnaxx. Well-balanced! I get camped as Horde. Hard to get into BRM. Fun as fuck.
---
This kind of binary thinking is hilarious. It's not that we can't succeed if we bring a 57, it's that I don't need to bring one because I can easily find someone better and thus get it done easier and faster. I don't expect people to bring my 58 Mage to MC because there are probably tons of 60 Mages with full Pre-Bis asking to join that they ought to take over me even if the raid is a joke and bosses die in &lt; 30 seconds.
---
Guildie is farming ravager for his shaman and i told him that its not necessary and the proc might annoy while soloing.
---
Him: "Ravager is bis for leveling from levels x to x"
---
What that the alliance are dicks too? He said nothing about factions buddy
---
Apparently making more than 1 spec per class viable = nothing. Please explain how flying mounts started the downfall.
---
The only dungeons I can think of where a 58 would be a liability are DM:N (massive aggro radius) and scholo (lots of patrols, dense mobs)
---
It’s simple. People who use this addon are taking the game way too serious, almost to a cringe level.
---
I bought it.
---
It cost me 550g, but it usually goes on my server for 450g.
---
If you spend a few hours doing a good farm for a couple of days, you'll be able to buy it. But you can farm those dragons for a couple of weeks and they still don't drop it.
---
some dungeons you can make a case to want to have a decurse as well (looking at you scholomance)
---
Sorry I can't hear you over our; shaman tank, boomkin, Ms warr, spriest dps, and our feral healer (he swears his gear makes him just as good as a holy priest). 
---
Actually now that I've said this, I think I'm going to instigate this run.
---
Why is QoL better?
---
The denial lol
---
It stands for healers have to die. It’s an add on that marks opposing healers and notifies you when they are casting a heap and who their target is. Also it lets you know what one of your healers is being attacked. It’s amazing pvp addon.
---
Yep bg's are gonna be so boring with nothing but premades (both being a premade and fighting a premade will suck for different reasons), you should be able to group with 2 other people at the most, or if you want to group with 5-10, you play against other premades only. Granted this isn't a classic only problem and has kind of been around forever
---
My point is there is nothing really to risk.  You may have to pull a few extra packs (bonus for the sub-60s), and it may take a few more minutes, but it's not really a big deal.  You 'risk it' to be a good dude and help out your faction.  Over the weekend on my server, it was impossible for high 50s to quest in zones like Winterspring, Burning Steppes, and WPL/EPL due to FP camping and a massive amount of gank squads.  Doing dungeons was the best way for them to level and work on some pre-raid BIS.
---
Also, I've grouped with my fair share of terrible 60s.  A terrible player is a terrible player regardless of level.  I'm not saying stack the dps with 58-59s, but invite 1 if you can.
---
You have to hit with Nightfall to keep up the proc, and, no matter what class you decide to assign it to (Sham is another candidate), it's better for your NF swinger to be Orc than any other race on Horde.
---
Annihilator stacks with Sunder.
---
Relevant axes are less numerous than swords, but those two axes are so specifically powerful that they're competitive for bleeding edge progression, with NF being arguably necessary, until BC.
---
yeah ive been to alot of contested zones
---
Ummm what? Hotw Druid spec can be used in both pvp and pve
---
I'm on Gehennas alliance, just over 40% alliance and all horde PvP in a fucking 40 man deathball, I enjoy it regardless. It's just a bunch of people whining because somehow they hate that PvP isn't always on their terms on a goddamn PvP server.
---
TBF it would be safer to do that if it was ALL questholders are within 20/30. It's possible for only one person to fail the escort (I've been there) so if one person lagged behind a bit for any reason and it kept booking it since at least one party member was in range, one person could easily fail it and would never be able to catch up.
---
Unfortunately they dialed it too far in the other direction in Wrath, by far the most undertuned raid in WoW's history. A middle ground would have been nice.
---
Dude's wrong, you can't meld in combat. It's mostly useful for going AFK, or sitting in one spot waiting to ambush an enemy as they're walking by.

I've played with a few different MMO mice, and the G600 is the only one i returned to. Definitely my fav. 
---
For reference, here's the MMO mice I've used:
---
* Razer Naga (original): Cheap build quality, lmb broke after 1-2 yrs
---
* Razer Naga Hex: Didn't have enough side buttons
---
* Logitech G600: Was good until middle mouse button broke (bout 3 years in)
---
* Corsair Vengeance M90: Liked the mouse, felt heavy and built sturdy... button layout did not work well with my hands.
---
* Corsair Scimitar: Liked it *almost* as much as the G600 but had numerous software issues and while it had a good amount of side buttons, it did not have enough buttons on the rest of the mouse. The build quality also felt cheaper than the Corsair Vengeance line of products
---
After the Scim i tried out random lesser-known brand mice that I can't even recall the names of, none of them came close. I ended up returning to the G600. It's a great mouse, super comfy with good software support. I really like the extra button on the right (which is often just a finger rest on other mice /cough scimitar /cough). Really the only complaint I have about it is the middle mouse button. Maybe it's because of the design (you an push the middle button to the left or right, not just down), but it seems to be the weakest part of the mouse. I've seen other ppl complain about it breaking relatively easily, so just keep that in mind and don't be too rough with it. 
---
Hope this helps! Lmk if you have any other questions
---
Go watch some shedo the feral druid videos.  Non competitive DPS my ass. IF THE FERAL HAS MANA POTS HE PROBABLY HAS MANUAL CROWD PUMMELS.  That person will PUMP damage.
---
Esp UBRS when you get like 19 messages from dps. I'm sorry, but if I get 3 rogues who want to come, and I'm a mage, I'm not going to invite a second mage, I'm gonna stack the party with rogues so I have a better shot of getting my loot.
---
My understanding from Kargoz’s hunter guide is that whether you clip your auto shot or not depends on your ranged weapon. Generally with most weapons you don’t want to clip but with Rhok you actually use aimed and multi shot off cool down and clip auto shot to maximize dps.
---
No, no, and.... no.
---
Because of the massive number of players on each server, there's not as much opportunity to *specialize* in a tradeskill and be the go-to for this or that as there used to be.
---
Production professions *can* be fun, but the taught recipes will be completely unneeded. If you are in a guild and your guild needs an enchanter, or an engineer, that's helpful. If you can get access to rare recipes, that's even better. You might make some cash DEing items and selling on the AH, but remember that it's only a good deal if you would sell for more than the item vendors for.
---
On the whole, enchanting is a money sink. You need to build up a network of customers, get rare chants, and spend time in cities hawking your enchants, because you can't put your chants on the AH.
---
If you want to make gold and that's your end goal, you're best off farming and gathering.
---
what add-on gives you that stealth detection warning
---
Solo questing isn't the only way to level up. It's an MMO, go run some dungeons with other players. 
---
If your buddy died 10 times running from the FP -&gt; into Everlook -&gt; back to the FP... then he's terrible lol. But that sounds made up. Minimally exaggerated. 
---
Either way, like OP said, be prepared. Deploy some strategy. Maybe don't roll solo into a lvl 60 zone like Winterspring if you want to avoid PvP. 
---
If you and your guildie dislike it so much - go reroll on a PVE server.
---
**Here's the description of a Normal Server:**
---
*On normal servers, you have to manually flag yourself for PvP to fight other players. Choose one of these if you don't want to get ganked while you're going about your business.*
---
**Here's the description of a PVP Server:** 
---
*On PvP servers, you're automatically flagged for PvP anytime you enter contested or enemy territory, where you'll spend most of your time after early levels. Pick these servers if you want to fight other players often or like the omnipresent threat of PvP combat.*
---
Ultimately a lot of this handwringing comes down to this: most people picked the wrong server type.
---
that xbow from BWL is stupid fun in pvp as a hunter
---
I played it exactly the same, with most of the same people, and i had a very similar experience. Made it to 54 and had a great time enjoying all of the nestalgia. It was spot on vanilla. Unfortunately it's a huge time sink, and while I did have time for it in my teens, there's no way I could keep this up now.
---
No you can't
---
I'm sure it's fun, but most warriors are not gonna be psyched about rolling against 3 others for everything
---
Yet to see a lock like this but I've seen a few posts complaining about them.
---
I'm playing lock myself, I've only had one case where i kept pulling aggro but even after switching to only wanding I kept pulling (so did the mage) so that was a tank issue there.
---
Dotting isn't instant, but yeah on an AOE pull it's not a good idea to be dotting things too fast and if you pull once off a tank by going hard too early it's usually a sign you should slow down a bit.
---
Reminds me of couple of days ago in BRM. Needed a DPS and found a 57 mage sitting in IF. Leader told me nah, he found a 60, much better.
---
Dude was in Felwood...
---
I have done 60 emp runs most of which have 4 people (2 rogues, 1 warrior, 1 priest) and that room is a breeze.
---
Oh shit turns out clueless idiots get schooled
---
Acceptable for me? Not sure, but it results in me playing less and being more productive haha.
---
There are a few skips in DMW and strath UD that become impossible, and probably a couple in LBRS that I don’t know of; but even then, it’s hardly an issue. Like an extra few minutes per run so who cares if it means I find a healer 5 minutes faster
---
"Go collect 30 farmer skulls."

Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my wand specialization talents, but at lv 51 you probably aren’t getting as much from it as you think. Those points could help you up either your healing or your shadow spells dmg

This 100%. My friend spends all his playtime PVPing in hillsbrad in a raid group to "farm honor"  
---
I get 1-2 kills in winterspring/hour just questing normally.

We have equal honor.

Then why did this stuff only become a problem when honor was added?  People want a reward for everything they do.

Very nice, especially at that weight. Wilks?

I've been pretty successful with Sheiko Intermediate Medium Load.  I *could not* perform that high volume a program in anything but a home gym. Would be a real jerk hogging the squat rack for 30-40 min at a time.
---
Amen
---
I doubt it without more proof than a title on a roastme sub, but she's cute. She looks a little on the young side to play Sylvanas though imo.
---
I had a 35 minute run from Thorium Point to UBRS two hours ago.
---
I dont care about your life story bud type less and I'll read it
---
&gt;They can get past 30 without touching contested zones really
---
And then they just grind SM/RFD until lvl 40 or so.
---
Mal'Ganis-US and a few other servers were actually that unbalanced in Vanilla. Also, while population size does have an effect an exacerbating the problems associated with faction imbalance, your post seems to imply the because the numbers are bigger they are also more imbalanced, which isn't quite right. 
---
The imbalance isn't "bigger" because the servers are "bigger". There are very high pop Classic servers that are closer in faction balance. The *effects* of imbalance are *more pronounced*. It's a subtle difference but it's important. 
---
Tl;Dr: Just having the server capped at 2000 players wouldn't have prevented it from going 70/30.
---
I played a feral druid in most of vanilla and I can say unequivocally that going forms *protected* your mana bar.  I specifically made druids go cat form on the mana draining trash in AQ so they didn’t fill up their bar as quickly.  I also remember shifting mid cast during a mana burn and it canceling the spell.
---
Being able to mana burn a druid in forms is inaccurate and cripplingly imbalanced behavior.  Druids live and die on their ability to be the exception to every rule that applies to other classes, removing one of their perks is a completely unnecessary and hopefully unintentional nerf.
---
Might as well. Instant groups and you need the gear out of there anyways.BRD xp runs are good fast xp
---
I was thinking more along the lines of murloc, gnoll camps, etc. that are really frustrating as a solo leveler.
---
When I started 15 years ago WoW was like the branding of nerdism. Didn't really get worse than that. The fact that nobody back then even knew about runescape or other nerdier games made the only one people heard about an easy target.
---
Whether it was based in reality or not, I and others got a lot of shit for enjoying what we did and I'm slightly resentful about it. Happy for the newer generations where gaming is way more accepted and no longer an almost exclusive male hobby. It just makes me fucking sick to see people who pissed on me all my life talking about how fucking inclusive and nice they are. Fuck these people.
---
ye i read that u killed an alt and targeted a bunch of alts and then complained when they played the game exactly like u did (logging on main to protect their alt)
---
On my server, people only invite 60s to PUGs.  
---
You can try yourself or ask around - it's not easy.  People will generally ignore you, or straight up tell you they prefer a 60.
---
Yeah I tried to kill they guy to turn in the quest like 10 times as a shaman. Not even close, he spawns too many trees lol
---
yep i maintained top 20 on my realm of dk dps until i just couldnt bring myself to play retail regularly anymore just because i would do a high level key every week for the chest with my guild.... dk dps are not very welcome in M+ (although i think we do bring some nice utility, an extra grab is always good)
---
I believe similar addons existed in vanilla just not as wide spread, it's only using info your combat log already shows so i don't see how blizz could stop it.
---
The only reason I wouldn’t bring a non 60 is if we are summoning Doom. That fight is tough even for well geared 60s
---
Thank you- when I asked around people insisted I max out spirit tap and wand specialization.
---
Spy add-on
---
10/10 troll. Would upvote again!
---
You really can't think of any way to solve alt's problem? Just make it count first character created per server, or first character which achieve 10-20-30-40 etc lvl in game and have appropriate thresholds of restriction ratios according to those levels on both sides.  Literrally an equation with all the values stored in their databse. Jesus, that litterally took 30 seconds from my head and it till would be better than what we have now.
---
At least population ratio would be *managable* and could be taken in a proper way from ther*e.*
---
True story: posts like these led to retail!
---
depends where you are from. they have the same meaning but some areas will say one versus the other. i hear them both quite often including in sports.
---
You
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/smuggies/comments/ds90h9/future_wife/
---
no one even attacked you, lmao; just alliance things
---
You'll have to use LUA.
---
    local glowBoolean = UnitPower("player", 0) &lt;= UnitMaxPower("player", 0) - 2300;
---
Then do whatever with glowBoolean. Or as an alternative:
---
    local glowThreshold = UnitMaxPower("player", 0) - 2300;
---
Which is always your maxmana - 2300. I can't explain you how to utilize that in WeakAruas, though. Look at some other people's WeakAuras and try to edit them.
---
As an apparently more subpar lock who dies to most people 1v1...ouch. Do you have any good tips? When do you throw coil? What do you open with? What demon do you walk around with?
---
I used consumables too in the beginning, but later on I figured out the only thing you need is mana pots. Here's something I noticed of each of the fights:
---
* Solenor, you can defeat this boss without SPPs if you use rank 1 wing clip which doesn't enable the fear mechanics. [Here's a video about the fight without fear mechanic](https://youtu.be/B4o0D9Iwe2g)
---
* Artorius, the thing I noticed is that when the elevation changes, your distance from the demon closes faster than on a flat surface due to game mechanics. Anyways, [here's a video of killing Artorius](https://youtu.be/rKedPgD6n_0)
---
* Simone the seductress. I noticed she casts chain lightning and using nature resistance aspect with some random +nat res ring etc. you'll negate most of the dmg. [How to kill Simone](https://youtu.be/pW_9not9fCA)
---
* Klinfran: Personally this was the hardest of the bunchfor me because I didn't realize the enrage can happen without being implied in any way by animation or being stated in the text log. He just turns red sometimes, so you'll gotta apply scorpid sting just to make sure he doesn't kill you instantly. [Klinfran the Crazed - Rhok'delar quest #4](https://youtu.be/ZfRZhU9TjBg)
---
BC Arenas were so bad. Can't wait for every team to be Druid/Warrior and Druid/Rogue, or if they wanna get real creative, Druid/Hunter.
---
It was pretty obvious. Youre just too dense to realize that youre in fact, dense.
---
I came a little as well
---
You literally proved my point so thank you. Yes you are geared for your LEVEL. But guess what it’ll take you a couple days and you’ll have outleveled that gear. Then guess what you’ll say then “ugh I put in all this effort to buy my 40 mount, I don’t want to dump that progess without any thought”. This is the type of game where you’ll always have something holding you back. But guess what will never change, people not wanting to go to a dead server. So buckle up, put your big boy pants on. And move to a server with an actual population. Otherwise you’ll be posting this but with BRD/ubrs/scholo/strat in a months time
---
Because vanilla wow, the world and it's economy is effected by population more and plays very differently than retail servers. Everyone knows this.
---
The vanilla experience was 3-5k people per server max. We have 15k
---
not only was I doing this just for fun but I got a total of about 2k honor in an hour after we wiped 5 raids without a single loss.
---
dunno about your server but many pots seem to be selling for under what the mats cost, or basically break even
---
You can read about the downfall that flying started countless places with a google search. 
---
And I have 3 specs on my warrior that is viable in vanilla.
---
And in retail every spec is viable...for all classes.
---
With my current sex drive, it's WoW every time, but I have set partner nights, so I don't have to pick ~
---
Sounds like a group of engineers should leave some mines on the way up from below deck
---
I think he means you can shadowmeld before your group starts combat and stay in shadowmeld. like you can eat before a pull and stay eating during the pull.
---
&gt;Undead - fear resist 
---
You mean "free PvP trinket on separate CD, that counters mind control and charm - AkA effects not covered by any other trinket or potion"
---
It’s not that tough. I healed him with my 54 resto shaman and that was tough. 57-59 shouldn’t be a problem at all as long as you have some CC
---
I mean, you asked for ways to make more money. There’s no way around it for this method, it’s one of the best ways you almost double your money intake + free lock picking leveling &amp; some greens/pots
---
Spy does nothing that a player with infinite reading speed and comprehension couldn't do with the combat log open.  It does the exact same things as damage and threat meters do.
---
That's a really good point. My Guild Leader said that as well because I strictly follow the "white only" policy in those phases start.
---
Read the op's edit rofl
---
that's what it is.... Thanks!
---
mouseover doesn't catch them right away for me FYI
---
I love how there are so many peole saying, yeah im just quitting for a few weeks... then there are rogues.
---
Wtf took me 11 days and I played vanilla lol.
---
yup. tbh i dont trust random people to equip an item worth 500g rather than turn around and sell it. low level blues generally dont sell for too much unless they are a specific twink item.
---
&gt;Every discussion I’ve seen about Nightfall boils down to “give it to the Hunter for Wing Clip spam.”
---
Some groups maximise the uptime, others try to max the damage of Nightfall guy and give it to a shaman or ret pally.
---
I didn’t say it was most, I was just providing an example.
---
&gt;natural open world 1v1, 1v2
---
Also known as "nobody attacks you unless you're fighting a mob, or if you're much lower level than them"
---
Why do you automatically assume he’s being negative? C’mon, be a little less cynical :)
---
Can take tarren mill and go north up the river, granted it takes you right past chillwind camp
---
I guess it pertains mostly to DPS.  Ask your 58/59 players in your guild how often they get rejected from groups or ignored.  It's very often.
---
I feel like if this were truly a popular opinion, no one would be hesitating to take them in groups.  Even when I was leveling my priest, I frequently had people say "Wait let me ask group if a 57-58 is okay."
---
Yet hybrid classes can only do 1 thing in raids. Just because it doesn't affect the class you play doesnt mean it isn't a thing.  If you cant even answer a simple why question about fly mounts, you shouldnt use it as a point. The burden of proof is on you, use google isnt an acceptable answer.
---
I mean, yeah technically they do. You can't argue that those addons make rogues way less effective in pvp. I'm fine with this addon other than the stealth detection. Not even a rogue and i think its bullshit.
---
Drop Imp. Devo.  Max out righteous fury and imp bop.
---
Just paid 8g on bigglesworth.
---
Not to simply be contrary, but I would move that recommendation to 58.  With the tank shortage, it can be kind of hard finding certain groups in the 56/57 range.
---
You can only control your group - that would be 5vX.
---
If your question is where to go to keep X single digit, hunt in less populated zones.
---
Actually, its bis for mage AoE set or just any caster for PvP.
---
Is it that you want the rankers out of the world and in BGs or you think that playing BGs against people ranking will be more fun? Because I gotta be honest with you, neither is going to change things if you don't like being killed by people more organized that no-life the game.
---
I like to let people finish their business and heal/drink to full before I jump their bones.
---
You almost started getting me, but the part about the negligible (aoe-)stunn in terms of pvp on lvl 60 gave it away too early, Nice try though.
---
Funny, the picture you posted for computer nerd,  I know who he is in real life, he doesn't hardly even know how to use a computer
---
i looked it up after somebody else clarified, paternal is in fact a thing and its just identical/monozygatic
---
RIP. Since there's no fist weapon spec in the Arms tree or any skill increase from racials, I think you should be immune to disarm. It would just make sense. If you're Fury spec you can bloodthirst while disarmed though!
---
You didn't include that. Your suggestion.
---
Haha im just trying to say theres a probably a different mentality towards PvP when your already completed the game prior to this phase vs ppl still trying to progress.
---
Mine finally went through yesterday late afternoon
---
I straight ignore anyone below 48, they yield naught but a distraction from literally anyone else.
---
Blizzard also made it so so if you aggro an NPC first the escort wont engage and will keep on walking and aggro more or walking too far away making you fail the quest. Looking at you Amy.
---
I unsubsribed yesterday. I have sinced then: Fixed my bike, drilled a hole in my wall for ethernet (thought about it for months) and painted my living room. This clusterfuck of a patch was a real wake up call. I had a good run in classic. I reached lvl 52 with a full time job, going to gym 5 times a week, language classes and all. But playing now has tipped the balance, this is not fun anymore. I played on a PVP server back in 2006, I never tried anything like this. Getting killed at every flight master, every boat, every neutral town i visit. Getting steamrolled by all reds, as usual 3 vs 1 and most often lvl 60. I play alliance. Well I play no more.
---
At the end of the day, play what makes you happiest. I just know that Conflag/NF is underwhelming without good gear to back it up.
---
You don't have to wait until a later phase - just try to grab some gear for it especially, Spell crit. If you can do MC a few times you can get some stuff that makes it viable. Items I would target before going Conflag:
---
1. Eye of the Beast (easy to obtain 2% spell crit trinket)
---
2. Staff of Dominance or Azuresong Mageblade (the spell power and crit are just the boost conflag needs nuke people down)
---
3. Mana igniting cord (great belt with huge spell power and spell crit but some mages may be salty if you take it)
---
4. ***Talisman of Ephemeral power (if you get this item it will give you so much burst potential that you can probably go Conflag at that point)
---
5. Felheart gloves (high stam, spell power and 1% crit... just so good for PvP)
---
6. Robes of Volatile Power (2% spell crit and spell power. amazing.  Robe of the Void is a good alternative that is easily acquirable for tailors)
---
7. Flaming band of Stamina (amazing ring for Conflag pvp)
---
Skeram is literally the most unbalanced server there is, my fucking god I hate you people with everything I have
---
d i said i will switch if i keep struggling to but ri'll give it some time before i decide i wasn't arguing against me changing but i was saying i'm not going to dump my progress WITHOUT thinking not i'm not going to change server even if i end up needing too if i need to i will but i'm not going to docit straight away
---
Wait until I bring my main.
---
Thats a guy.
---
Nice to see the progress :) Love that u can see guilds makes it easier to manage raids for me :D
---
a) I didn't say that you'd gain Bloodsail rep, only that you'd lose goblin rep.
---
b) If you're in a raid you already don't need teleporter shenanigans to get away with fighting in Booty Bay.
---
You can HoT your target, then wait 5 seconds to drop combat, drink, and Shadowmeld. HoTs tick while you drink.
---
I feel attacked and I'm not 30 yet.
---
What class are you?
---
I can smell that My Little Pony guy from here...
---
Pvp was fun leveling frost
---
read my previous post again
---
Thunderfurry seems pretty well balanced from my point of view anyways
---
What should the build look like? Is one better for pve or pvp?
---
30 elemental 21 resto
---
30 elemental 21 enhancement
---
I said I don't know why the enemy players need to be in the combat log... I'm all for removing that and breaking the addon..
---
It had a lot more to do with Lord of the Rings, which was super popular when WoW launched. The number of dwarf Warriors named gimleexx, night elf hunters names legolaz, and human mages named Gandolfz was absurd.
---
If you are ever in melee range of multiple targets as a Druid *while in caster form, you're already dead. You're not getting any use out of the AoE portion of War Stomp as a Druid.
---
What should be build look like? Is one better for pve or pvp?
---
mana per five, unless you are ending fights like domo and rag at high mana.  then you can swap for more healing power from your mp5 gear.
---
you know i am right, you dont deserve the only enjoyment from this game, the players killing you mercilessly are entitled to play the game just as much as you are. grow up or leave,
---
Annihilator stack with sunder, faerie, CoR making it a bonus armor reduction. SA (2250), FF (505), CoR (640), and Annihilator (600) up, that's 3995 armor reduction. All bosses have either 3009(Lucifron, Gehennas, Shazzrah) or 3731 armor(rest of the bosses) (Sulfuron Harbinger is an exception at 4662 armor).  
---
Without Annihilator, you have 3395 Reduction, meaning the most of the bosses, will have 336 armor. The first 336 armor reduces the physical damage by 5,7%-5,8%(maybe even more for bosses). Having 1 debuff increasing the damage of the half of the raid is better than having 1 warlock spamming corruption. Annihilator is a must have debuff if your raid want to min-max.
---
"We're making this change for two reasons. The invasive nature of a mod altering and/or interacting with the game world (virtually or directly) is not intended and not something we will allow. World of Warcraft UI addons are never intended to interact with the game world itself."

---
Unfortunately the source link seems to not work, but presumably this is from a blue post. I know for sure Blizzard has iterated this same sentiment elsewhere. 
---
But yea totally made it up.
---
Wait are you talking about 2's?
---
3's is the only competitive bracket - all that other shit is for bad players to get gear.
---
full rotation, because of the speed of RD it doesn't make sense to skip an auto to start the aimed shot.
---
And honestly I've found that underleveled players tend to be more attentive and chill
---
The worst are geared (but not fully decked out) raiders. Blasting non-focus targets or opening way too early and asspulling packs that you skip.
---
Do what?
---
That's interesting because the last time I attempted a UBRS with more than 2 rogues, all the rogues left(including even one from my own dear guild!). One helpfully said "too much melee is a pain".
---
It's a good thing that I forged on, and advertisted "LFM UBRS caster dps" and after roughly 5-6 minutes or so, was able to get a warlock, mage, and something else(I think it was a shaman).
---
But on yet another UBRS, I had a total of 3 warriors in the group, who didn't seem to complain or have issues about the group makeup. Anyways that run had its own set of drama when the shaman rolled(and won!) on the tanking shield that dropped. The 3 warriors exploded but there wasn't much I could do.
---
&gt;TB
---
Also uncontested due to being their starting area, which i find bs inside SM.
---
Nope.  Ice block is a 5 min CD though, to do it twice so fast you have to burn Cold Snap which is a 10 min CD.
---
Actually you should just get good at the game and learn to accept that you're the reason you're losing so bad. Guess what, the addon Spy doesn't play the game for your opponents, they're actually just beating you by being better at the game and you're rationalizing your losses.
---
I think you can nearly always bring lower level healers. 
---
However, that fight does come with some level of rng. If you get too many enforcers, you need your tank to have decent hp. 
---
It’s definitely doable. Most people want to mitigate that rng by bringing higher level players.
---
Warrior or Warlock for Battleground PvP and 5 Man Dungeons/Pug Raids?  Wont have time to join a guild and get on a raid schedule so looking at which can perform the best for a casual player with little to no raiding gear.  Dont really care about the effort to level, its mostly about which is best at 60.
---
Fear Ward has a 30 second cooldown. Yes it needs to be applied beforehand, but for 25% of the cooldown (and the ability to cast it on targets other than yourself!) it's well worth it.
---
Yep, people are going to complain that Blizzard queue system is bad and they need to make it so premades only go against full premades ignoring all the problems that such a system would produce.
---
I don’t have to prove it to you. It’s already been discussed. I simply refer you to the answer. 
---
Play retail then. Then you can play in nude if you want via transmog.
---
Yeah, I have a mana bar WeakAura that I saw the code being used, I'm not programming literate is the main issue.   
---
So basically find a way to save this code as a variable somewhere, and then reference that variable when determining conditions for the WA?  
---
Like I have the trigger set currently, are you saying that a "LUA" can be saved as a more programmy language kinda trigger that does the same thing, but has more versatility?
---
Benediction my friend
---
150 SL is twinking? I was really into DS1 and DS2 pvp and dont recall. Not saying you are wrong but maybe i just wasnt on the right DS pvp forums.
---
How much was it?
---
That's not stupid. That's just common sense. You sell your item way easier at 15g because otherwise someone else will undercut. I also set my tsm to max x3 price to just post at dbmarket instead.
---
Yeah layering complaints were about people abusing the system (and rightfully so).
---
WPVP complaints are about faction imbalance, how Blizz completely @#$#ed that up, what they're doing to fix it now, and how it's making things worse.
---
Does anyone find the level 60 dungeons are a little less populated this week? Maybe cause there's so many level 60s doing world PvP? My computer basically shits itself in Hillsbrad or Searing Gorge
---
You get honor for killing people with res sickness.
---
Goddamn I'm in this comment
---
Look at the last won, that was me!
---
This type of talk is tossed around frequently, and its all anecdotal.  As long as rpg’s have existed, there has been a mathematical theory of optimization for performing as best as possible.  
---
For example, in vanilla there was a rogue named Ming.  He was a crazy person, probably the blog equivalent to a popular streamer today.  He was as min/max as you could get for rogue pvp.  I read every post he made at the time just for little tricks I might not have thought of.  
---
I think the issue is MOST people were more interested in the fun of the world vs being server first.  There were less players on each server, so everyone probably had 1-5 guilds that were fully optimized while everyone else able to raid were clearing rag after BWL was released.
---
Most people just weren’t looking or weren’t interested enough to look, but the information was always there.
---
im leveling a hunter alt and did a BRD yesterday. a nice pair of leather boots dropped off a boss in arena and they were an upgrade for me. there was a rogue and i waited to see what he would do and looked at his boots. it was a huge upgrade for him and a small one for me so i passed. if its not mail and not a major upgrade or BiS, ill wait till the leather users decide if they need it. if its a tiny upgrade for them i may roll.
---
a lot of people just dont have courtesy.
---
yes that works but if you are really trying to climb rank then that is a horrible way to do it. im not saying you wont get any honor from camping a FP. its plenty fun and you will get some hks and honor here and there but for people trying to climb rank and push standing its a pretty bad way to do it.
---
Why is this thread getting upvoted? If I could downvote this 600 times to be hidden I would.
---
Secure targetting frames/buttons can't be created while in combat, its the same with Spy. So you wouldn't be able to switch focus while in combat making it not that useful.
---
Same. Even as a squishy Mage just minding my own business in town I think that is horseshit. It really kills  any motivation I have to roll a Rogue like I did back I  vanilla.
---
Should've made your character on a PvE server if you don't like open world PvP.
---
Looks great! How often are you planning on updating it? Looks like my character's info is at least 10 days old.
---
Also I'm a hunter and it doesnt show my ranged weapon.
---
This is why I like reserve groups. I'm happy to pull in a level 57 or whatever as long as they don't plan on rolling on a prized item of mine.
---
I don't think someone going into their first Strat or whatever should be taking an item that I've run the dungeon over 20 times for.
---
Rolls on a pvp server. Whines because people attack.
---
Yeah, probably best to quit.
---
Like?
---
Occasional death squads? It’s going to be constant death squads in every 48-60 zone until BGs are out
---
I am complaining that I have to do that and they have to do that. The servers are too populated so 4 people decided to level their alts by grinding mobs in the useless Gelkis cave in fucking desolace in a monday morning.
---
I died less times to pvp doing all quests in STV on main than getting like 1 level today.
---
Its the opposite actually. Im saying its OP, you obviously didnt read the post.
---
&gt; I'm not gonna come home at 7pm just to sit in a 2 hour que again because blizz fucked up. I would just quit. As a lot of people probably would at this point
---
You're pretty much explaining what people that are on the opposite side of imbalance are going through. Spending 30 minutes just to run to BRM from IF / SW and every other high traveled area is camped by a group of horde that are 10 at minimum.
---
My buddy is a beast druid tank. Call him the Big Bait Bear
---
I do like PVP, but i like chosen PVP like an area designated for it.
---
Or just look at the forums and other places yourself. More and more People just ask for sources because they are too lazy to go search themselves. That’s what I was getting at. In a debate you’re suppose to come prepared with knowledge on the topic not just default to asking for others to do all the work.
---
Gottapoo
---
please for the love of god, re-sell or give to an alt, do not waste that on a pally
---
Brd has a xp farm if you’re horde that is really good xp/hr. You accept their version of jail break over and over while abandoning it each time and there is a wave of elites that spawn each time and run into the cell where they can be AOEd easily
---
I'm sorry I didnt read your last post, can you make it shorter??
---
yeah its frustrating sometimes when higher level guildies wont help out lower level people. Idk if its a personality thing or what im always down to stop waht im doing (unless it already required time investment and cant easily be re-done like a dungeon or complicated quest) and go run and help people
---
Yeah something is definitely wrong with how you're playing the game because the addon has nothing to do with that.
---
If that is the case, you're in luck. Horde isn't closed to transfer.. so just give it like a month to even out. The horde has just as much reason to leave your server now. No one to pvp, and their bg ques come p3 will be ridiculously high.
---
Sounds like the both of you agree ...
---
Because they're mostly accurate...at least in the United States. The country has an obesity epidemic...children are struggling with diabetes. The reason people remember that *one guy* who played wow and was a fitness junkie is because it was the exception and stood out not because it was basically everyone they played with.
---
This meme may be a little optimistic of our physical health. Just a touch.

---
One thing I had never considered before, until I ran into a female streamer that did it:  Disabled folks.  She streamed for some folks that had no mobility options, and they would often tell her what they wanted the character to do.   Seemed like a really neat idea.  She wasn't one of those boobs in your face streamers either.   I thought it was pretty neat.
---
You a very funny man
---
I feel attacked
---
I'm 33 and a frost mage for aoe leveling, last night me and a 30 mage, also aoe spec, fought and killed a 40 warrior / pally. It was super satisfying
---
Haha I'll stick with classic thank you very much. 
---
I'm not even interested in trying shadowlands.
---
I am not disputing that it will drop or not, I am saying it's not nearly as huge as it was (is?) in arenas.
---
I might roll an alt on a PvE server. I love PvP and I would do BGs and such when released. But I cannot try to play one on a PvP server. I’d get too mad.
---
Then I'll be a horse bandwagoner once we get those sweet sweet belfs baby
---
Greatest troll post culmination in the history of this sub.
---
&gt; It's not about pvp aspect that we hate
---
Lol and literally state that. But to elaborate, I have a toon in PvE as well. Even in PvE realms, questing and farming is still pain in the ass just due to sheer number of players. The mob density and spawn times weren't made for this many.
---
How are you able to see character talents?
---
Cry about it
---
&gt; Horde ganks when at less than 15 percent health or in a group. Other than that they run away.
---
This is just people in general in this game. The Alliance will do the exact same. Stop acting like one side is a beacon of faith and love. It's so cringey.
---
well thats why i said generally. there are a few exceptions. and i would warn anyone about the worth of shadowfang so they dont equip it unless they are a twink.
---
No they aren't. Put them in a  high stress and/or social situation and the cracks really start to show.
---
Or a level 41 weapon if you're a feral tank.

Your definition of "hack" is a funny one. Alt F4 is probably a "hack" as well, right?
---
By your definition, DBM is a hack as well. Even worse.
---
&gt; If you read your combat log and then typed /target player that takes time to execute, this makes it so any player has the reaction of a terminator.
---
Again, same with DBM. You could read up the timer for a boss ability and manually set a timer. But that's a lot of effort midfight. So DBM does it for you.
---
&gt; Yes I'm a gearmaxxed level 60 Horde

We know. You having fun on your alliance alt you don't really give a fuck about isn't relevant.

Tbh I haven’t even run SFK yet. Skipped right past it
---
we just did it in p2 this weekend but we had a 14 man guild body guard group following the hunter around
---
Feeling powerful. Not shoot a fireball or summon a demon powerful, though. It something more visceral. It’s the way my Big Bad Pauldrons look. It’s the 4K health pool. It’s seeing the LFG channel shout into the void hoping I will see it and come tank their dungeon. Its that feeling when I step into an instance and equip my sword and board. It’s telling a party to jump and having them ask how high. It’s taunting a heavy hitter off a clothie and feeling their sigh of relief echo through the ether. It’s staring at a pack of elites and seeing rain, knowing I am my groups umbrella.
---
I fucking love being a warrior man.
---
Almost as good as me buying a bloodrazor for 40g and selling for 400g 😁
---
"Scrap". Basically you get a button to 1 click sell all junk in your inventory. You can add items to it by dragging it on that button, and it will remember for next time. There are some options you can enable that i think are helpful, like counting soulbound gear which you can't use (plate for a cloth user) as junk too.
---
I think you could include soul link warlock in that, I've had a lot of success as boring old pve spec warlock against rogues 1v1.

---
How is it any different? This is the exact same concept as drinking in arenas. You HoT your target, then Shadowmeld + drink.
---
I was congratulating OP. Reading seems to be very hard for you.
---
I was 6 levels lower and it was fine. 57-59 is completely fine for dps and even tank
---
At this moment, you pretty much need songflower/onyx is to run effectively
---
How hard is it to have no auras? There's stuff which doesn't show up as a buff which still counts right?
---
Can you help me?
---
I would say Alliance has underrated pvp racials. Alliance pvp racials WITH Paladin utility is overall better in organized pvp. When Alliance premades go against Horde premades and everything is equal numbers, players are going to see how strong good Alliance comps can be.
---
Wars raise your hands.
---
Okay. Bad day I guess
---
Better lore
---
Found the alliance player.
---
You need to be lvl 60 and with good gear. you also need to get 300 engie, craft all the gnome stuff, drop engie and powerlevel it again, this time goblin. Something like gnome death ray+bomb dispenser+fire helmet (buy it from elemental leatherworker)+Mighty rage pot+mortal strike with your big-dick weapon should give you enough burst.
---
It took me way too long to figure out this joke lol.
---
I'd say wait till you get to go big dick on Rag before making a final judgement
---
U can heal as shadow but it’s always going to be a lot more harder/slower for your grp when doing so. I’d recommend switching between the two specs (shadow/holy hybrids)when wanting to solo grind/heal.  
---
If your planing on killing stuff then wand 5/5 is a must imo. I noticed if you starve a shadow priest of raw stats and get +healing/spell dmg then you become very ineffective. 
---
If your using spells when the mob is below 50% then it’s a waste. 
---
Low/high rank of bubble depending on how much dps/health mob has. I make sure my bubble only lasts until my last mind flay completes so I’m not wasting excess mana/health that will be regenerated by ST anyways. 
---
Mind blast,SW: pain, mind flay (1-2), finish with wand. 
---
21/30 for healing is a night and day difference to me and can’t go back to healing as a spriest any more unless I’m spot healing in UBRS or an easy BRD run. Other then that I’ll grind out gold/rep/quests for a few days then respec and heal dungeons for a few and switch whenever I get bored.
---
so for those of us who don't play 5 hours a day
---
huh? no i will do fine once bg's are out, chances are if we come talk to other in a couple months i will be higher pvp rank then you, (i'd even be willing to place a wager on it) but you wont even admit that others can play this game for other reasons than your own so what is the point?
---
The impact is not as big. People die/respawn in BGs, there will be uneven skirmishes, you're on the move. I really dont know why i am continuing this you're obviously a troll
---
Yes true!
---
Oh BTW my friend thought so too. That I only hold aggro because of undead. No not really.
---
Mark a target to focus first 
---
Judge a dmg spell. Apply seal of wisdom. Use conc and you tank everything.
---
Improved ret aura is very helpful imo. 30 holy dmg =48 aggro dmg or even 57 aggro with improved righteous.
---
Together with conc = 134 dmg in aoe each second on every target.
---
It will be really hard for people to steal aggro with salvation.
---
All you need is a short headstart because as soon as you loose aggro you don't have any spell to steal the aggro back
---
We have a few ways, but we havent collected talents for the majority (yet). If you submit your character it includes the talents. If you havent submitted but still see talents it is because we do a "/who" search and then query the addon channel for everyone we have found in the "/who" search. Then we mimic a Details! addon request and store the data it sends back. So everyone who has details installed and is caught by the who search will have their talents displayed :)
---
It's sickening that you don't understand that what you just described is PvE servers. Reroll on a PvE server, and get EXACTLY what you just said you wanted.

BRD AOE is pretty good leveling, and doing arena and the inquisitor lady gives some good gear
---
Cool. Don't think it'll ever get changed cause it's just part of the game. You can keep wasting your breath whining.
---
PvP servers automatically flag you for pvp when you enter a contested or hostile zone, but not when you're in a friendly zone.  PvE servers don't have any distinction between the zones, it's like they're all friendly.  In order to be flagged for pvp, you have to actually type /pvp.  
---
As a result, you get to choose whether you want to participate or not.  If you do choose to pvp and you decide it sucks, the pvp flag goes away after 10 minutes of not engaging in a fight, including time spent while you're dead.  Just wait for the flag to fall off as a ghost and then carry on in safety.
---
Ahh now I understand! Thts also why you rolled druid no gear competition!!! You cant stand the thought of even losing a roll
---
Niccceee thanks for the detect magic tip
---
As an Alliance on Thunderfury, I would agree.
---
Maybe it's an alliance thing but playing horde I've never had this be an issue. I've never seen a single dungeon advertisement for 60s only and I've never had someone say I was too low. 
---
Did strat at lvl 56 other day
---
I think maybe you're surrounded by jerks
---
any rough ideas on what the minimum distance is?
---
Makes sense, considering that Cartman is a complete and utter asshole.
---
Your teammates might die and respawn at Stables, but you are still in the fight at Blacksmith, pushing a new base, meanwhile the enemy healer is OOM...

---
Due to how closely packed BRD is, I don't think invisibility will help you much. But speed and a really nasty single target CC might give you an edge against that one rogue who's trying to solo you?
---
In the 6 seconds since you moved in until you ice blocked none of those people attacked you once. Lmao. No instant abilities no nothing.
---
The add-on let's you search commands if you don't remember them
---
If they're running BRD, Strat UD, or Scholo, you absolutely would be holding them back by not being a Mage
---
Do I lose the enchanted kelp when I summon the elite on the island for Skull of Impending quest? Or can I try again if I die to the elite while trying solo? 
---
Asking because I farmed the damn kelp for an hour and a half.
---
The only fucking reason open world is cancer right now is becuz of spy addon i strongly incent for everybody to mass spamm tickets to brake this maphack addon
---
This. This is brillant!
---
The difference is all your points in arcane with some in frost for raid, and deep frost and blanket cs in arcane. 
---
They couldn’t be more different if they tried.
---
Flying and draenei ruined TBC.
---
Make sure you’re specc’d correctly and have engineering so you can use those items. As a warrior you’re very gear dependent. At 55 I’m assuming you don’t have a lot of crit gear so it’ll be tough. 
---
My suggestion is to git gud by getting to 60 as fast as you can through grinding mobs in winterspring or forcing yourself into BRD.
---
On a PvE server, you flag yourself for PvP.  You can do this by typing /PvP.  Attacking/using any abilities an already flagged player of the opposing faction, or doing actions that help a flagged member of your faction (such as healing a friendly player who is flagged) will flag you as-well.  Some other ways to become flagged include stepping into another faction's major cities.  You can toggle PvP back off by typing /PvP again, but the effect is not immediate (so, you can't just be losing a fight and turn it off). After about 5 minutes with no combat it will turn off on its own if it auto turned on by attacking someone or going into a city and you've left, or if you typed /PvP it will turn off about 5 minutes after you have typed /PvP again.
---
Warriors are god mode if you have gear and a pocket healer.  Otherwise, meh.  I'd go warlock.
---
Technically speaking yes. If you soulstone yourself and log out, the buff will not count down, but the cooldown will. When you log back in and soulstone someone else, you will have soulstones 2 persons.
---
I believe Ur a smartass
---
So there’s no way to implement autoloot for a specific spell like pick pocket with a Marco?
---
No I know, I mostly said it so other people see it and look in to it. It's super handy

As a mage I dont get what makes the torch room so hard... the mobs have such low life and die quickly
---
They can still drink... also, if we're just coming up with insane stories - same situation except you war stomp to interrupt a big heal and their main dps dies, winning you the fight. See? this story is 100% proof why taurens are better
---
You could also go to the Nightelf 12-19ish zone Darkshore (Boat to Auberdine from Menethil Harbour, Wetlands).  
---
TONNES of quests there really efficient and fun leveling.  
---
Then head back for Redridge/loch Modan elite quests.
---
Corpse run into BRD. Run just BRD until things quiet down or you're high enough level to do other dungeons.
---
I spent 52&gt;60 entirely in dungeons before pvp started, just looking for gear. You might want to do DM at some point, but I don't know at which levels.
---
Buy some BoEs and slap fiery enchant on them.  Its super strong at low/mid levels.  That's pretty much all you can do.  Rogues aren't particularly fast levelers but this will help.
---
What a useless waste of time comment
---
It’s black and white because it is the classic version.
---
Could not find the add on on twitch :(
---
i had a guildie farm it for his rogue twink. took him over 100 clears.
---
Seth Mcfarlane made a joke while hosting the oscars claiming that John Wilkes Booth was the only actor able to get inside Lincoln's head and he got booed by the crowd and he said, "too soon?" I can't find the video or else I'd post it.
---
Why did you roll on a pvp server when you can only play a little amount each week?
---
That’s ret pallies can find groups that want them for the spec that they want to play, and they don’t HAVE to respec holy like most everyone in this thread is suggesting.
---
Mindless spamming a single healing skill. Its not for everyone but I love it.
---
Brd is really good and as a healer you could probably go lbrs at 55 its apparantly really good for xp
---
But not when your main is lvl 35
---
I think my server kurinaxx is about 70 percent horde. It's pretty brutal once you get up past 40 as alliance. Even when I manage to defend myself or get away 1v1 it's pretty common another horde is nearby to kill me
---
I don't get how the rate at which the addons are used has any merit here. In fact, wouldn't it have been more likely to have been removed when it was a niche addon that was giving certain players a large advantage, vs an addon that most people are aware of and simply seen as very useful to have for pvp?
---
It feels like that's a non-argument really. Also I don't believe it's quite as simple to remove part of the combat log from the UI as they do make it easy to separate the buffs you'd like to see/not see. One is on their backend and much much harder. You say 'they can just do that, it wouldn't break anything' as if you understand their code in depth.
---
I'm done here.
---
Orc racials are better than WOTF imo. 30% natural stun resist vs a fear break once every 2 min. Most trinkets already break fear also.
---
I can think of a hundred other things more important for dev resources than this.
---
I'm fairly sure the comment this responded to also breaks this rule.
---
Gz on ding :)

No, just beside it.  My second day, in raid, was 220, and only 1500 honour.
---
I'm convinced at this point it's the only way to salvage classic. Blizzard let this problem snowball and if they don't so something to fix their fuck ups many will leave.
---
Hahah hahahahaha he’s an IRL friend of mine
---
Which is true, and that’s what I do, but that’s talking like lv 10-45, after that the sanding isn’t quite as beneficial as it used to be
---
The guy reasoned for using an unethical method (Spy) by saying that ‘it has been done before, therefore it is okay to do it now also.’ 
---
If you still dont understand my point i can not help you more
---
A well geared priest is also baller since holy nova has no threat so you cant pull aggro.
---
There's no shame in using it. Shame is on blizzard for allowing its use.
---
HOW DARE YOU ALL HAVE FUN WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE
---
I agree, although there doesn't seem to be an easy solution other than to turn it off and ruin a bunch of other addons that aren't a problem.
---
may as well throw away our comments like your username , i missed the /s at the end, and you were not bright enough to pick up that you cant clear MC 4 times in one week, let alone get to 60 days in the few  days the the honor system was out for.
---
Wow thanks for the descriptions - never knew /s
---
That wasn't an exaggeration... and your 'helpful' option to basically never go solo anywhere is a steaming pile of shit.  Not sure how your server works but on mine the groups going around ganking are five minimum but usually a raid of 10+.  So you are suggesting that if you want to get any quests done you should always roll out in a group of 5 (since any more than that you don't get quest credit)?  
---
I am sure Blizzard definitely intended that everyone should either find 4 people that need the same quests they do or four people who in the goodness of their heart will just follow you around while you quest.
---
Get off your high horse - you know the way it's working now isn't intended and you know it wasn't like this in Vanilla (I do - I was there).  Nice try though.
---
Ehh did it on my lock in about 30 mins he’s chilling near Kazzak with 70 shards waiting to summon main warlocks so they can do the rest
---
Ah I see you submitted a bug report via the in-game client, Reddit
---
That is a lot of CDs all at once, is that what people typically do? I thought I would have to use goblin helm to knock people down and then use deathray to hope that is enough burst
---
No word of a lie got told I couldn’t join a group because he didn’t want melee just aoe classes when looking for brd. Fair enough I get that. But later once I found a group I kept world chat up to see how long He would be positing for and would you believe the whole 1hr I was with the group he was posting that he still needed a dps. Sometimes it is just easier to roll with who’s available than waste time just trying tI get the perfect run in.
---
But targeting someone does not mean you see them if they stand behind a tree.
---
That was the part i didn't understand. It sounded like it was somehow able to see through obstacles.
---
&gt;A sham will barely have less uptime than a hunter
---
Yeah, only about 20% of hunter\`s uptime. Just a small difference. For good Nightfall uptime you need a no-c spammable attack that procs it (like wing clip rank 1 or hamstring), not a huge burst of attacks once in a blue moon (windfury proc).
---
Yeah I did exactly this
---
Wahhhh waaaahhhhh waaaaahhhh

Imagine wanting to play with your friends but you cant.
---
The helmet looks interesting, how long would stun last typically in PVP?
---
I could be wrong, but to successfully FuryProt (I think that's the build you are referring to), you need to be well geared. I'm not even 60 yet, and only have a few of my pre raid BiS, so I'll definitely be going deep Prot to start.
---
aLl OrBS reSeRvED
---
It's part of the world pvp experience and there is nothing you can do about it.  Although a fair share of people about my lvl engaged too for honor.
---
No offense mate but you telling me about you're damage in raids doesn't prove anything.
---
Unless you're a streamer or have no job, which almost seems very unlikely for the group of people playing today, it literally is impossible to reach Rank 14 unless you account share. You can't work 8 hours a day and farm 13+ hours a day. Along with anything else life throws your way. It's just not possible.

---
Yes - Grobbulus is balanced but I don't want to give you false hope that solves your problem.  It is till nearly impossible to quest unless you play off hours.
---
That being said if you are looking to PVP than you do have equal footing in trying to get kills if that is what you are going for.
---
Tl;dr I literally had no idea what pvp server actually meant.
---
Deal with the Corpserun to BRD. It’s not bad. Just focus on getting one step ahead every time.  It makes getting to dungeon that much sweeter.
---
Lol @ a mage having a tough time leveling
---
If you have money get flurry axe and axe of deep wounds really good at 60
---
Once you tame your first pet, it will also level as you play.  Each level earns it points that you can spend at the Pet Trainers.  Once you buy abilities from the trainer, [you go here](https://i.imgur.com/GnFbl1k.png) to actually train your pet in the abilities.
---
Your main focus starting out should be keeping your pet fed to gain and maintain its loyalty.  Cats eat fish and meat.  Keep that paw print next to its health bar green to maximize its damage.
---
Other people mentioned taming multiple pets, but keep in mind that you only have one stable slot and extras cost a couple gold.  Also, different animals have different diets and trying to constantly rotate food inventory can be more work than it's worth.  I've had my Teladrasdil cat straight through to my current level 43, and he's a beast.  I did stop and tame a tortoise, but he's been sitting in my stable since.  I just wanted one.
---
Pummeler is still BiS for tank druids for threat.  So as a tank you should have both.
---
Lower levels aren't so good either. There are level 40+ 5mans hunting players in 1k needles. I'm all for pvp but having to sneak around in most desolate zones possible just to avoid being griefed for 1-2 hours by a bunch of bored people isn't what I really wanted from a pvp server. At least it's somewhat tame because rest is busy roleplaying.
---
I’ve recently changed my perspective - if people are ganking while you’re trying to level you need to embrace the pvp. Form a group, call your guild to arms, push back on them! You don’t have to be a geared 60 to join the skirmishes around. In fact, the pvp would be way more fun if it wasn’t just roaming packs of entirely geared 60s. Quest in packs and when the opposing faction shows up try to give em hell. If they call in reinforcements, try to convert to a raid!

If that’s completely unappealing and your idea of fun is just leveling, then that’s totally fine too. As someone else said, just leveling is going to be easier on a pve server. Leveling from 1-31 is way faster than finishing 31-60 and won’t be nearly as painful to re-roll than to see out. Alternatively, stick to dungeons only and be prepared to die a few times on your way to them.
---
32~47 is a good level range to be for stv and tanaris pvp
---
so i am unique \*wink wink\*
---
well, can you prove him wrong with your data? :)))
---
if you're on Fairbanks and see me online I'll help a fellow warrior.
---
You just made me a worse person
---
They are shitty for doing a 15 with me every week?
---
Should be advocating for no add-ons then if you really want your quality of life that low.
---
Thanks appreciate the comment
---
Reported comments are dealt with
---
Im not saying your way of playing is wrong if it's fun for you ok it's fun for you. The way I see anit though and it's just my opinion is that if you're gonna do something do it right. Give your all. Get to sixty and don't even know what a consumable is? You're letting 39 other men down. Get to 60 and wanna meme on your ret pally? You're letting 39 other people down. That is selfish in my opinion. Now what isn't my opinion but is based in facts is that you knew the exact date p2 was coming yet you still chose to continue playing your way to the determent if you becoming max level. So now you deal with those consequences and that being trying to level on a battlefield. If a person isn't 60 at this point they have no one to blame but theirselves. That is fact.
---
You mention that it was available in vanilla and try to use that as an argument towards why it should be acceptable in classic. I'm just trying to help you understand why the issue is different.
---
Noone knows the backend code but the game developers but to say it's impossible and will break everything without understanding the code yourself is contradicting your own argument.
---
I lost several IQ points reading that comment
---
Yeah I don't see Huan anywhere
---
so looks like i played wrong to enjoy p2, i should drop my work and powerlevel like madman
---
Back in Vanilla, my guild was still doing MC for alts and undergeared new recruits even when we had AQ40 on farm.  I also think that by that time, 10/10 pug MCs will be fairly common.

You are not expected to know everyone's BiS list but you ARE expected to listen to people who say something is BiS. If you are feeling really paranoid, you could take two seconds to check any of the readily available resources online to confirm this or not. Besides, by the time you've run a few level 60 dungeons, you know what people are after for their BiS list. 
---
It would be scumbaggy for someone to take something from another class that they will be looking to replace pre-raid if it is that class's BiS - especially since some items are BiS well into BWL and AQ40.
---
I play on a PvE server so nothing has changed for me. Back when wow first released I didn't play on a PvP server until well after the honour system was released. I enjoy PvP but only when its an actual fight and not massive slaughter fests.

The default keyboard shortcut for skills is "k".

Lol the alliance helping horde while horde have 40 man raids camping redridge for some reason
---
look at the map

alliance spots are shit compared to horde
---
Welcome to a PVP server.
---
Wait I’m alliance on a 40:60 server and I still love phase 2. Even more rushed content in the form of bgs is very bad for the game imo
---
Sometimes I would use Distracting Shot to pull a non-priority mob to my freezing trap and usually within the first few pulls I'm getting flamed so I just stopped doing it. Hunter utility feels worthless unless your whole party is in on it and doesn't want to just zerg everything down so the healer is out of mana after a single pull.
---
I'd have to experiment more to see if there's a pattern with what shows up and what doesn't, which can be tricky since you want to watch opposing players enter your draw distance to be sure they already had the buff on (and obviously you can't confirm a negative result).
---
Should’ve rolled on a PvE server if you knew world pvp was gonna make you mad.
---
So you are the problem?
---
That is what I'm asking. Has anyone datamined it?
---
HAHAHA
---
hmm, idk, all i know is im missing all my kills and honor from yesterday lol
---
Let’s see a warrior reset his threat
---
Once BG's come out, this won't be nearly as big of a problem.
---
Fair enough that you also get AD rep for Scholo but scholo is one of the more irritating dungeons mechanics wise. Lots of casters to Los, poison clouds, jandice can be a shitfest all on her own.
---
None of the skips in DM:W were impossible on my 58 pally. You can still skip all the trees, the tree boss, the packs before ghost boss, the pack uptop of the stairs, the first skelly pack and all 3 roaming elemental packs at that level.
---
Probably should have looked into that before rolling PVP.
---
On a normal (PVE realm) you can only attack other people who have flagged themselves to PVP. So you do have set areas where people often meet to do world PVP or you will encounter people in the world who are flagged you can attack (you can flag yourself and use emotes to try and taunt a fight out of someone).
---
On a PVP server though a lot of the world PVP will only happen when it's in the other persons favor.
---
Death coil, escape artist, curse of exhaustion. He can never reach you again unless he pops CDs. If he pops CDs to close the gap you're in good shape.
---
Don't you see? It's different when they do it. God forbid I don't feel like carrying some low level and/or shit player through a dungeon I'm only doing for boe's.
---
You rolled a gear dependant team play class solo on a pvp server with little time to play. Somehow I don't think it's the game at fault.
---
That's literally what a PVE server is.
---
I imagine you speak for PvP? For PvE the warblade is oddly BiS. The +frost damage works in a really interesting way. Check out "TheClassicPally" on youtube for more information. I tested it myself between the demonshear, polearm, and dreadforge. At least for me it pulled higher.
---
My resources were incorrect, 3min cd in BC and the source I quoted was wrong with their vanilla spell listing. Either way it still frails in comparison as it can be dispelled by many of classes
---
Holy nova has been a god send for Lyceum runs but it IS extremely mana inefficient. Can be tricky to find the right balance
---
I read that wrong and interpreted it as you quit because you only wanted to do a 15+ with your guild every week and you were made less welcome. My apologies. Will delete the post.
---
To be honest I was arms until 60, where I respecced 0/31/20 (furyprot) and didn’t start on pre bis in earnest until I was 60. I was mostly 2h tanking trash and board + sword on bosses, and can’t really think of healers running out of mana from full in any fight
---
That’s a unique playstyle, very inclusive! 
---
&gt; boobs in your face streamers 
---
😂🤣
---
The issue usually is that the shadow priests are dipshits and do use MB and is why I generally dislike them as I most often tank and have to use taunt for it.
---
The whole idea of no changes is not we’re climbing into a time portal to relive vanilla, but that we are playing the same game/same rules
---
The manner in which people play monopoly today vs 1939 is different, but that’s not because the game changed
---
Can't get that time back though
---
Yeah that part isn't possible, but hunter's can send pets after them and follow the pets and priests can cast mind vision
---
My last run of ST: Every single group before this kills all the mobs and dragons n whatnot before Eranikus or whatever. I have no idea why the lower floor took 2h, I was telling everyone the statue order the entire time and saying we had to clear each balcony, several balconies misses and it took awhile too get the order done. Boss went fine. Upper just took forever to clear balconies so i think tank wanted to dip as he was the 60 and just wanted a shot at something on the lower floor or maybe the balcony bosses, idk. Anyway we just run through the main area and over to Jammal and then Eran, try to fight him and the whole fucking half the dung runs over and just demolishes us. Lesson learned to fight the mobs lol
---
A) That was still a nonargument, the scenario is mildly different but even so it's more in favor of the mod now
---
B) I never said 'it's impossible and will break everything', I said that they would have to extensively change how it works (true), and being as it's a base part of the game, it's a fairly easy assumption to make that it's a fairly core part of things.
---
Even if it isn't 'impossible and will break everything' (which I did not say). It would take a good amount of time and effort, along with changing how things like combatlogs can be parsed using /combatlog.
---
Don't put words to my statement that I didn't say.
---
All my friends picked the server i just joined to play with them, i had never watched the game be played or played before i had absolutely no expectation of what was gunna happen.
---
&gt;Servers that have 3x the amount of people as in vanilla is not #nochanges though.
---
More like 5x if not 10x.
---
here's why your system tends to lead, in general, to the worst possible outcome, of minimizing value for your group.
---
the warrior clearly values the forors. however, there is strong evidence that he does not value consuming the forors at AH value.  how do we know that? because if he did, he would have purchased the item (liquidity problems aside).
---
so now you are often in the position of allocating items to people who value consuming the item at less than market value.
---
on the other hand, if the item is sold, then it will ensure that the player gets AH value.
---
all need is the most fair option, it cannot be gamed, it does not incentivize bad item choices, it does not discourage people from improving their gear.
---
Broken brained and mental gymnastics.
---
Your argument appears to be at odds with itself.
---
That vast majority seemed to ignore the large portion who kept posting that this was what it would be like. There's also been a huge amount of posts here from people even before honor dropped complaining about PVP but describing exactly what always happened on wow PVP servers. You'll get ganked, for every fair fight you have you'll have 10 or more times you were killed while already fighting a mob or by a group of players or by a higher level player. That's a lot of what the PVP experience is in wow.
---
Does a target that ressed with 50% only give half honor?
---
Welcome to WoW since the beginning where corpse camping for hours was a daily thing and the factions were never balanced. #nochanges
---
It lasts something stupid like 30 seconds, or until they take damage. Basically an engineering version of sap. But if you're just trying to run, or set up a wombo combo, it does the trick.
---
After LHC bloodbath which happens 24/7, this was a refreshing surprise, though not even 5 minutes after this I was killed by an Alliance priest, so there's that...       
---
These events are rare af, but when they do occur, they're beautiful.
---
Yep same here on Alliance on my server, Horde have taken over Menethil Harbor and all the ships, as well as all our questing towns.
---
Why the hell would a shaman- ugh. PUGs.
---
Can you explain more? Is this only the case with +healing gear to boost up the heals of the low level spell? I'm reading up on it now and it says it gives back the *base cost* of the spell as mana.
---
Sorry but a geared shadow priest is a tough match up for a rogue you're trying to oversimplify it a bit too much.
---
This isn’t true. Those coordinates are where you were when they casted it
---
This is not true, MANY HAVE NOT QUIT, a lot of players who may not have realized what was about to happen during P2 may have (will ) let their sub run out.  but most players on pvp servers KNEW (or at least had an idea) what was coming. 
---
There is a vocal minority on here crying about anything and everything about the game, they do not represent the population as a whole.
---
If you want to 1-shot people - you need to stack as many burst dmg CDs as you possibly can.
---
I had this situation happen on my rogue duo. This ?? Troll Priest was desperate to MC/DoT us as the boat took off. Where were hiding at this very location, she tried to hop down and ended up shooting off the back and into the sea.
---
It was beautiful.
---
It sounds like you are not a fan of open world PvP..... it's almost like there is a type of server you could have chosen to prevent this.....
---
Love the post. 
---
Can't stress enough just how *easy* this game actually is if you have moderately competent people. Unfortunately people love to lord over others any chance they get.
---
You would have a free transfer available if you’re stuck in queue.
---
What'd they // what do they do?
---
Yes, because skipping the onxyia chain quest in burning steppes is totally acceptable.
---
You’re using spy and you call me a nerd? xd keep tryharding dude
---
Didn't they add that ability to mass dispell in LK? And in BC it was just regular dispell AoE?
---
Please help yourself and input this in-game!

Yeah healing touch is so powerful with +heal it really is the best answer to fall back on it.  In a lot of UBRS runs (with two healers) I've simply let the other healer handle just the tank / offtank and I spam downranked efficient HT on anyone who needs it.  I can sustain this a really long time due to high mana pool + some passive regen and it's a ton of effective HP returned to the raid.  I imagine druids play a similar role in 40 mans- utilising our strengths as much as possible (very consistent, efficient heals).  I hope to do this in my raid, just spam downranked HT on the tank and let someone else deal with the occasional top-off as necessary.  Seems like healing for like, 5-10% of tanks HP per second very efficiently can work very well when combined with someone else (priest or shaman perhaps) that can put a quicker heal onto the tank when necessary and combine their own efficiency, say a shaman with healing way.
---
that's just false.  
---
Largest growth was vanilla (obviously).  
---
Largest peak was end of WotLK
---
What's happening now is an extreme due to honor literally just coming out and the fact the servers are overpopulated in classic and often skewed heavily in horde's favor. But all this was predicted to happen. Just relax though, it will won't always be THIS bad because once the newness wears off people will tire of this and once more content eventually launches that'll become the new thing to do.
---
It's really a mess though with how stupidly easy end game raids are so most people at 60 have nothing to do but PVP now.
---
But yeah a PVE server sounds exactly what most people here complaining actually want and describe wanting.
---
LMAO you obviously never tried did the quest yourself, if you think the hunter quest is comparable to a normal typical wow leveling quest. You should go back to killing 10 boars for some green hat, as you are obviously not well enough informed to comment on this topic lol.
---
trust me, if you dislike that someone else can pick when you are forced into pvp (or die by giving up)  you can stick it out or you could re-roll on a pve sever, but things wont get much better unless you adapt/improve. best of luck,
---
Ive heard in mainly in streams and from streamers tbh, but i guess there are always going be pockets of differing opinions. A lot of the bigger streamers do anticipate this will kill the game, but ive no idea, no idea how it faired previously tbh
---
The problem of being on a minority pop of a server isn't that it's hard to find targets so you can get honour.. it's that you can't avoid finding the majority holder. Everywhere in the openworld, no matter what you do. So doing anything else can become tedious to the grade of impossible quite fast.
---
Thank you for letting me know, I will install it immediately
---
That's not even true lmao. You're crazy.
---
I'm thinking if they just didn't display non-combat abilities and buffs from the enemy faction in the combat log it would fix the issue and not disrupt damage meter add-ons.
---
Why
---
Your guild had AQ on farm?? Damn son. All the bosses?

We dragged a 51 and a 53 rogue through BRD with a Shadow Priest, Holy Priest and a Fury Warrior. Lyceum wasn't fun, but we still downed it in 1 go.
---
That's what hunters are supposed to do. It's amazing to me how many Hunters just drop a trap anywhere and just let RNG decide who gets frozen. You're supposed to kite them into it.
---
I left my guild cause they would help we do runs when I was 52-59. I was so over it. Now I’m 60 and can’t find a guild to start up with .
---
Transfer with your IRL friends to a more balanced server.
---
Guys really it wasnt so hard to pick the best realm, try one that doenst have high population and problem solved
---
I just finished it this morning. We've killed Domo 7 times, and he finally dropped leaf last night. I've had loot from rag but no bow/staff... so I've had small hunter syndrome for a while, ha. We recently transferred from a horde-dominated server to an alliance dominated server for Phase 2. I had a gut feeling that leaf would drop the first week of honor on the new server, and sure enough it did. I'll have PTSD of getting camped and watching the demons despawn. Finally got my weaps though!
---
Don't think it is, but there are probably alliance refuges coming in by the day.
---
I have a busier life than the vast majority of you redditors I assure you, yet I have been sixty since week three. My child hasn't suffered for it, my wife hasn't suffered for it, my job performance hasn't suffered for it. Laziness is why people aren't sixty. Jealousy is why people get triggered and take offense to posts like mine.
---
The fact you and many like you are this jealous over some pixels is what's really sad. Im sorry im better than you at a video game that doesn't mean im better than you at life....my dude.
---
That's not what confirmation bias is, you fucking comedian.
---
Take as much stamina as you can.
---
You totally can, we've had a couple people come to Dun Morogh to duel us and vice versa in Durator, on a pvp server. Ofc trying that in phase 2 won't end well.
---
Unless they break the spy addon and make it so faction based queues limit the population balance to a max of 40/60 nothing will change.
---
Prove something that’s entirely subjective and different for server/time/day/number online/20 other reasons? :))))))
---
&gt;fix the fucking game
---
Lemme tell you how effective this communication is
---
That would break Retail pvp with regards to BG's and arenas.
---
I know how the game works, I just think you're lying.
---
you're missing the point.
---
Yeah i get that, i mean i have 5/8 giantstalker will bis enchants, onyx completed, i only run mc once a week and farm gold atm, so i cna understand why people are just running around killing you, its just so different to p1, the guys who would leave u alone to farm in peace now just attack you as if its only just turned to pve and was pve before, its odd, it feels like people feel they have to pvp just because its a pvp sever, idk just my perspective as someone fresh to the game
---
And a ton of 5-man runs, PUG or not, grinds at the soul. Grinding BRD for HoJ and Savage Gladiator Chest were mind-numbing, and while running the same 5-man dungeon can be smooth and routine, "smooth" and "routine" equals "boring" and mistakes get made when players get bored and annoyed.
---
30xp from mobs! How!?!? It’s Molten Core it should be a bagillion XP from mobs
---
Games are meant to be fun, if people aren't having fun then they need to quit.
---
And you think this is complaining? I can't wait till all the tryhard players are whining and crying about having 2k people on Silithus at any given time makes farming too "difficult" while casuals are having fun somewhere else. So don't worry, your time will come.
---
Some ideas for 50+ grinding, areas of zones that are out of the way and no real reason for 60s to be there.
---
Southern Tanaris (Silithids, turtles)
---
Northern Feralas
---
North east Azshara, temple of arkkoran
---
Northern winterspring
---
Silithus
---
Deadwind pass
---
nah i dont wanna play as much because my classes dont feel as fun as they did in legion and im burnt out on raid leading and arbitrary grinding with diminishing returns
---
Don't take it personal. Instead take pride in it if you aren't one of the majority hunters that are too stupid or stubborn to dismiss their pets when appropriate. I am just giving an example based on my personal experiences. I did make sure to state many times that not all are like that, but it does create an image for others, such as in my case.
---
I must have replied to the wrong person, I was meant to be agreeing with you. Was targeting the other fella, my bad.
---
there were 30 people in ironforge when I last checked, so yes it is tiny, don't know where you got the 10k number from but most likely inactive or multiple toons.
---
Flawed idea, it would just mean people would relog their level 20 alt and run into huge groups of the opposite faction in Hillsbrad Foothills just to troll them.
---
Depends on which versions of the PvP sets we are getting, as they added improved versions towards the end of vanilla. No one knows which versions we are getting
---
Jealous over pixels? Oh wow, you’re beyond delusional. All I’m saying is that I want to play the game I’m paying for, and that nobody between casual and hardcore will suffer for allowing that through the release of a battleground. 
---
What an embarrassing comment, straight up.
---
Nope.
---
W,A,S,D for movement
---
q,e,r,t,f,c,1,2,3,4,5 for main abilities I use all the time
---
shift + q,e,r,t,f,c,1,2,3,4,5 for abilities (and consumables) I use every once and awhile
---
ctrl + q,e,r,t,f,c,1,2,3,4,5 for rarely used abilities and things I don't want to accidentally press (like Lay on Hands)
---
Shaman are also pretty OP in pvp. Ele shams are scary, certain totems like grounding, earthbound can away a fight, and earth shock and frost shock are great control/damagers.
---
Go for the healers. Even if you cant kill them, you can prevent then from healing their team.
---
I see guilds advertise "10/10 MC 1/1 Ony." What does that mean? I know it's molten core and onyxia, but what do the numbers mean?
---
That is in fact all it's about.
---
can't say I disagree with the guy about hunters
---
I guess you didn't read the rest of the comment where I refer to the honor system being unchanged.
---
Some more strawman and I'll build a straw house
---
Tell me how effective is it to have in game boss mechanics requiring characters to have been created before others in the raid.
---
Go ahead.
---
how does that work? Does afking flag you up? Because Ironforge is certainly not a contested area.
---
People need to be patient, hasn't been a full week yet they say they will just quit completely. They knew this was coming.
---
What would you use for your CP builder?  SS?
---
Hey you a brave man, i will offer you one UPVOTE as i am sure a bunch of the idiots who though they would roll on a pvp server and become a ranking GOD will be here to downvote you. 
---
"Most of these players" should have played on a pve server and just either A&gt; flag themselves or B&gt; wait for bgs
---
Also there is also people who think that cross realm bgs will mean Equal Q times for both horde and alliance, which is a joke in itself, there are WAY more horde who will be doing Bg's you are right about short Q times for ally
---
Critical strike chain lightning
---
Interested too. Playing a lower level rogue, misses, parries etc. with combo moved don’t use energy but finishing moves do.
---
I’d like to know more about all of the mechanics
---
That’s strange.. it’s Pre-Raid BIS so I figured it would sell. I haven’t seen it for less than 96g before tonight.
---
No they aren't. The only gamebreaking good thing in PvP in classic is Orc racial.
---
Comparable to abusing a teleporter that only horde can use? Horde camp the boats too, so idk what that has to do with anything.
---
Boss clears they are 10/10 bosses cleared in MC and have cleared ony
---
Ive decided to kill every mage i find in the open that im capable of killing. Those bastards already have it east enough, but they need a broken ability like blink that teleports them AND removes stun/snare? Wtf?
---
It's not just a break, it's also a 5 second immunity to fear. So break a warlocks fear and beat the shit out of it while they helplessly take the D.
---
Just on the Bite vs. Claw side of things: Bite is definitely the go-to for leveling. Claw does more damage in a short period of time, but will drain your pets focus if you keep it auto on, so you have to keep a close eye on it. In the long run during boss fights especially, bite will do more overall damage since it is more sustainable, and you can even keep it auto on alongside growl auto on without having to worry about focus. Definitely saved me a lot of trouble.
---
This is not a good answer. He is an orc.
---
Blizzard didn't force anyone to roll the factions they did...
---
a lot of the player base rolled horde knowing full well it'd stack things. People have made posts here mentioning they went horde because it'd be safer.
---
That's a player base issue.
---
Haha, no. The top premade on your realm will literally be days ahead of you.
---
The Alliance starts seeking shelter in the capitals, then they find out they just don't care as the horde doubles down hunting Alliance as less are in the open field.
---
Just curious because I'm new to wow. Did vanilla feel empty outside of trade cities? I'm on a high pop server, so I'm playing in an environment where the server is significantly more full than vanilla was. 
---
But tbh its already pretty hard to find groups for dungeons lower than brd for my alt and it seems like there arent many people in the open world besides brm. I cant help but wonder that vanilla sized servers would have felt pretty lonely.
---
I play kirtonos on the horde side. World pvp isnt much fun for me either. 10 hordies chasing 1 ally isnt exactly fun. Haven't had hardly any fair battles that felt rewarding win or lose. It's all just a dull experience. I went and started leveling an alt and just raiding on my main until BG's come out.
---
It means that have killed all 10 out of 10 bosses in molten core and have killed onyxia
---
The problem was there was only a handful of servers at launch. Blizzard forced people to choose between a dozen servers which quickly filled up, leaving many unable to play the game. They decided to bump up the server capacity because they didn't have the foresight or care to make enough servers.
---
For 15 years now I’d say at least half the complaints of WoW are from players trying to solo things in a world that absolutely sucks if you’re not grouped with people. I feel for people that can’t seem to find the right guild or group of friends but all my MMO experience is that you need to find regular friends and guildies to play with or the game ends very early for you.
---
Yeah, I haven't been able to turn in a quest to the Bulwark since last Wednesday because of Alliance raids camping there. It goes both ways.
---
They are doing it for honor as evidenced by the fact they weren’t doing it a week ago...
---
EU Ashbringer feels balanced.
---
Similar thing happened to me.
---
Alliance was getting torn apart in Feathermoon stronghold. I somehow managed to take the boat and get to the mainland, but there were some horde scattered along the shore too. After dying a few more times, I finally made it to my quest location and starting killing the water elementals. Out of nowhere, I get polymorphed. I figured it's another mage ready to 2 shot my level 48 warrior ass. But then he just wanded me once to break sheep when I got full health. Then he proceeded to help kill mobs for me making sure to let me tag them first, while regularly polymorph healing me so I didn't need to eat. I finished my quest and we emoted each other our farewells, and continued on our separate paths, likely to never see each other again except perhaps on the next battlefield.
---
Best P2 post so far lol
---
Rogues arent killing SP in stunlock unless crit RNG goes nuts.
---
Prior to phase 2 dropping, my guild finished up an MC and wanted to go out and do some group WPvP. We decided to attack Thorium Point and ran into some familiar faces! Epic battle ensues where we were outnumbered for most of it and managed to take control of Thorium Point... briefly... before being overwhelmed.
---
It was a ton of fun, and these skirmishes are becoming even greater as alliance and horde alike become more familiar on each server. Gz to all, and good luck on the honor grind!

You’re at the point where you need to stop worrying about spirit so much. Get +damage or + healing gear and switch around depending on what you want to do. As shadow in groups you are always going to have mana issues. 
---
As far as soloing I typically mind blast, SW pain, vamp embrace, wand. Might throw a mind flay in. Usually only have to drink after chain pulling 10-15 mobs. 
---
I’m currently mostly prebis though with 414 shadow damage and probably around 170 spirit.
---
- doing the same exact thing 7 hours a day
---
- complains it’s tedious
---
Maybe the fact they havn't used algorithms to anybody advantage so far during the entire launch of classic
---
What
---
That date is no surprise, it's right around where everyone predicted it.
---
Uh probably? That's quite far in advance lol.
---
Bars. Think each one is 5%?
---
Raid modifier and divided between 40 people, trash was giving me 5-15 XP per mob.
---
Reminds me of the epic weapon quests from Everquest. Amazing gratification when you completed it
---
If intimidating shout doesn't last it's full duration, it's because the target took damage (or used a fear break ability like berserker rage or will of the forsaken) likely from your deep wounds talent if you're arms
---
Okay, Mr. [literally just ripped that from wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)
---
Now pray tell, how does that even apply to this conversation? You're just throwing around buzzwords that you don't understand because you think it makes you sound smart.
---
"Day 59: The elves still haven't caught on but the Furbolg's are starting to worry me."
---
Ok.
---
r/ContagiousLaughter
---
Aww you poor dear, its almost like playing on a pvp server demands you be more aware of your surroundings, Hmm.
---
&gt; the only thing that will matter is time.
---
Yes, and the top 1 premade on your realm is going to be DAYS ahead of you in terms of honor.
---
This is it exactly
---
Got 90% of my pre/bis and better but get rolled by rogues and mages because they naturally specced well for PvP as pve talents.
---
As a fury warrior though. It's gg without getting the charge in first haha.
---
Sorry it was a rhetorical question
---
It would be really cool if you could set budget constraints, so like I can tell the addon if I have under 3gold, don't buy any water
---
When I'm trying to run across Searing Gorge the other day I got killed when I landed, rezzed starting running towards Blackrock get killed 3-4 times from a group of 5 horde patrolling the area. Decided fuck it I'll just spirit rez and TP to Stormwind, get killed at the graveyard 2 times. Idk this is obviously anecdotal but wow pvp has really made the game NOT fun for me. I can't fucking wait for BG's though \^\^
---
It's because while it is probably the best defensive option for prebis neck, it has no threat stats.  A defensive option isn't really needed for MC or Ony, especially at that kind of price.
---
I think for him it's the part you wrote in english. Seems not to be his first language. Try saying RRRREEEEEEE, next time. I'm sure he gets that.
---
Tl;dr: I rolled on the wrong type of server and it’s not my fault
---
Dont care
---
Doesn't do that in my raids.
---
I'm literally leveling an alt on alliance on the most competetive PvP realm on EU right now. It's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. Who cares if it takes you 15 minutes to go from the flightmaster to a dungeon if you're gonna be clearing the dungeon for the next few hours anyways? So the only people complaining are people who are mad that it isn't PvP on their terms or people with limited playtime, and endgame in vanilla was never ever intended for people with limited time. So people which weren't meant to play the end game by design are complaining, why should that be reason enough to rush out content?
---
Full servers in vanilla were 10k, full servers on classic are 30k
---
Something's fucky
---
Jesus, what madman would buy a bloodrazor for 400g?
---
AlL ThAt wAs NeEdeD, so simple, thanks.
---
we did it with our main source of AoE being a feral druid casting Hurricane, lol.
---
Yeah I think we get the point already.
---
That's the server I'm on! Horde or ally though. Maybe the price had gone down but they were 45g on Saturday
---
I hear things work out in the end
---
If you don't like the amount of Horses maybe you should roll a gnome? Their robo chickens are solid alternatives
---
I’m not arms anymore, im guessing they either use a potion or some kind of ability
---
The game is dead since the release of P2, so now you see it all in ghost perspective.
---
So it's 25 then?
---
why? equal horde and alliance join battle grounds,  that will leave more horde in the world looking to rank up while not in a bg, they will be killing alliance with less alliance players who have an interest in wpvp to defend each other      (alliance who care about pvp will be filling up the bgs so more horde can join)
---
Sources on this?
---
Very cool, I had topmeoff on the 1.12 client, this seems similar but more configurable.  Thanks!
---
Eh, some other classes have hit rating in their talents, and often in trees you actually want to stay in. It's actually fine to stay 18 survival as it has some DPS talents and pet utility can drop off in raids specifically. I went 20 BM because I solo a lot of stuff on my hunter, and I'm unsure how raids will go. Respeccing once you have hit gear is fine I guess, but also I probably will only even be entering raids when I'm already pretty close to cap so eh.
---
Yea, lemme get a 40 man of all my raid day guildies and run to SM so I can do GY once. Dumb cunt.
---
It also gives them shit for honor since it gets split so heavily. The other day I was in a 40-man raid that got overwhelmed by 100+ horde in BRM. With diminishing returns, on average they got at most a single HK worth of honor from the entire incident.  I got more honor out of that than most of them probably did. They could farm honor faster just about anywhere. It's not about honor and never has been.
---
And there was already a bunch of players who were only raid logging because they had nothing to do, now they log daily to PVP. It goes both ways. MC and Ony were far too easy to keep people entertained.
---
If it has NOTHING to do with honor then why was this not a problem before p2? Of course the honor incentive is involved
---
its not 70-30 its actually roughly 50-50 overall. The faction balance on individual servers is screwed though.

Sunk Cost fallacy.
---
One of the problems for me is I've been running dungeons with a mage and warlock that are 5-8 levels higher than me, so holding threat has been hard. Maybe once I'm 60 I'll be able to go with that spec.
---

---
Look at all the content people are doing
---
That's not true at all no matter how much you want it to be. I remember Paranoia and Radar were both popular PVP addons.
---
55 war on sulfaras alliance. I was 52 when phase 2 came out and I ended up rerolling prot to dungeon grind. Luckily, of the 5 IRL friends that tried classic again, I have 3  who still play that reached 60 right before phase 2, so they were able to help me run ST, BRD, and even Scholo for gear and levels. Def not going to play weekdays on my war for the time being. I have an alt mage at 30 that I'll lvl if I feel like playing after work. If the mage starts experiencing unbearable pvp, then I'll reroll horde on a pve server or take a break. 
---
Honestly, if I didn't have my friends playing, I would have rolled on a pve server from the get go. Wish you the best of luck.
---
I once tried to do Strat live without disease removal (druid healer). Don\`t do it. We didn't make it to Scarlet part.
---
Scholo is just as easy at 58 as it is in 60 if you never actually farmed gear at 60 and know what it feels like to stomp/overgear a 5 man.
---
From a leveling perspective what are the recommendations for hunter cat abilities. I’m NE so Prowl will take one slot. My thoughts are:    
---
Prowl, Growl, Dash, Claw/Bite
---
Shamans are great but so are paladins in group PvP. What the deciding factor is though is that people mostly care about how good their character is rather than how good their group is. Their ego is attached to their character and their racials are a big factor in 1v1/1vN. Also the meta where horde usually does have a population advantage skews the faction balance even more on PvP servers. Players want to be on the winning side.
---
Yea but what axes is he gonna go for? Deathbringer? (5% drop from Onyxia). Like the options are very limited. If he’s gonna PvP for right now I’d go with the dal rends.
