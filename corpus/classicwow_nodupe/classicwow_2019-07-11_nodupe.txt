It's fun because it's unbalanced.  Those who spend hours of their lives farming raids/R14 for better gear have a true power feel.  And beating a tryhard while you're in dungeon blues is a lot of fun as well.

Draenei ended up on main on a fluke. Trolls were my fav for Horde and NEs for Alliance, but I liked the idea of a Light blessed Race becoming a Death Knight so I ran with it.
---
Could be totally unrelated but in the unreleased Warcraft Adventures game, Thrall disguises himself as a Dwarf to get into a Dwarf encampment. Kind of alludes to that with the assumption you're an orc in disguise?

Well ever since BoAs on retail you kinda did
---
Week 1 Will be especially hard. As it will take very fast leveler to get to 60 in their greens with some blues at around 5-7 days PLAYED. That means that the first people to hit 60 will probably be at the 1 week mark. And no one is killing rag in lvl 40 greens
---
I found that it's fun if you're grouped with a couple of decent players. If you're soloing and you're grouped with a bunch of terrible players (pretty common!), it's particularly frustrating to play a healer. But even if there is like one or two decent dps players in there, it's fun. maybe you can queue up with a friend or two.
---
Yeah you're the 15th person to say that lol.....nice troll.
---
Too many deserts and parched areas for sure. At least Tanaris ran with it and everyone dropped water pouches that were *valuable*!
---
However, I loves me some Feralas, Azshara, Winterspring, and Ashenvale.
---
LOL I'm more than comfortable with my raiding experience in Vanilla that I don't need to show proof to anyone for what I did.  Especially since a fuck load of people did just as much and lost just as many screenshots as the rest of us.  But, yes, we had 2/5ths of Naxx down by the time TBC hit.
---
It's not a nerf. Private servers, if they didn't include this critical strike reduction, didn't match the system they were attempting to emulate. A nerf implies that a game designer decided to change a game mechanic because it was imbalanced. That's not what is happening here.

I'm pretty sure that's why they look the way they do.
---
There are addons like [Immersion](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/immersion) that I hope will be made for Classic. I want to read all the quest text, but unless I consciously think about it, I tend to fall into the habit of just clicking Accept as fast as I can. These types of addons really help me to get into the quests!

I was Horde curious, my narcissistic fundamentalist Holy Light parents sent me to a Scare away the Shaman ways camp, after escaping their crazy control I'm now loud and proud ZUG ZUG!

Don't worry, Blizz will have them up in the store for Classic WoW. :\^)

Wow. I didn't think he was going to go full babymode on you.
---
The maximum total number of hits a tank will receive in a 5 second window is still the same. The chances for getting it is just higher with more parry hasting. If DW tanks weren't dying with 5% parry then won't be dying with 14% parry until healers are going oom.
---
Yeah, I know there’s a lot of good qualities to it... but t doesn’t draw me in at all. On the other hand, Elden Ring has me more hyped than maybe even Classic. Dark Souls with even more RPG elements, more open world, and George RR Martin? Sign me the fuck up.

Imagine choosing your race based on the shitshow that is WoW lore rather than on appearance and racials.

Ah gotcha. Thanks for responding! I'll keep my eye out and if I see anything I'll toss yah a dm!

Oh finally I might be able to help!
---
I have always favored alliance, just as you favor horde. But, after several months, I still never managed to find a guild I liked and did in with, so I made a horde alt. I was and too fond a group almost immediately who I clicked with, so I faction changed my main to horde. Still in that guild today.
---
At first it felt weird and wrong, like trying to read backwards, but being in the company of people you actually enjoy helps SO much. Eventually I considered it "my" faction, and never rolled alliance again for 2 more years.
---
But, I still like the alliance cities and races better, so I did eventually go back. But this time, I don't feel like alliance is home. Neither is horde. I can happily play either faction, and I'm just choosing based on race/zone.
---
I suggest if you go nelf, find a group you fit in with. Soon you will feel much better about not being horde.
---
That's probably because Snutz had to log off. That was a looong day with all the delays and general scuffed-ness, many people logged off to get some sleep after losing like Soda and Cdew
---
I'd laugh at you, too. It was a blue ring drop in *Desolace 15 years ago* and you're saltier than the Shimmering Flats.
---
Don't forget that you're earning money every time you open a junkbox and it contains reagents you'd otherwise be paying for.
---
Dont you mean... Png me....
---
I haven't played retail since wrath, so I didn't think of that... but good point.
---
I'll take that as "pugged molten core twice".
---
If you blind a blind and there is noone to see it, is there still light?
---
its WoW, everyone is a guy. Especially the girls
---
Joana is someone on the internet, thus is always a guy. Even if he were a girl, he would still be a guy
---
Yeah, that is the reason, but also, you need to be in redridge anyways to get chausses of westfall and eventually, you will want the flight point. 
---
I think it makes a lot of sense to do the high value quests in zones anyways, because if you don't quest through northern wetlands to arathi... how are you unlocking the flight point in hillsbrad, to get to scarlet monastery? 
---
Beyond that, it takes a long time to grind out smites. Hakurai's group (3 warriors, everyone is 20, priest, everyone in the group has either an orc crusher or better, from what I can see), runs are 25 minutes.
---
meaning that between vendoring and resetting.... it's probably 2 runs an hour. 5 runs per smite's: 2.5 hours per smites. 7.5 hours for someone to be on a 13 dps weapon is a LOT more healing required, and for a struggling group, I can't imagine it's not worth the time to just come out swinging. 
---
Really, warriors are very very gear dependent. That's something you REALLY learn playing a lot of warriors. I think it's a mistake to think "I don't really want to kill 15 orcs, then run across redridge and kill 1 elite to get 7 dps for ~5 hours". That's an insane deal, pre level 30.
---
I want to avoid those guilds.
---
Alliance who desperately want to avoid STV and Hillsbrad.
---
Gear and talents are auras.
---
How is everyone here finding guilds in advance?
---
The soil of a man's heart is stonier....
---
Horde or alliance?
---
The first dual wield won't die. Crit won't effect their survivability. It's more the dumb DPS that isn't paying attention and pulls threat will die.
---
Dual wield tanking will be a thing. It was happening in vanilla as a meme.
---
I watched the beginning of this stream; I think the time cold be accounted for the lack of concurrent other players competing for mobs/ect.. And thus will not reflect classic wow launch.
---
ah true
---
Use a second monitor. Get isoboxer or lidc. A healer and tank is kind of the foundation. Heavily utilize macros. If you do it right you can play two toons in pve nearly as smoothly as one.
---
I dont know what this trash is but it sure isn't classic wow. reported
---
I mained druid and hunter in tbc, so I'm glad you chose those two.
---
Yeah, they buffed their healing. That isn't class identity. That is just making them do better on the meters. Also, swiftmend was in vanilla.
---
How was the best spec thematically better? Hunters literally had a one button macro that played their class for them. Hunters were more difficult in vanilla (I raided in vanilla and TBC as a hunter.)
---
Every expansion gave classes buffs and more abilities that covered their weaknesses. Your first sentence was literally "druids sucked". It wasn't that they lacked an identity. **Their identity was they brought innervate for priests, they could battle rez, MOTW, Faerie fire, thorns.** They had an identity, but what mattered more was meters. They were valuable to the raid and viable. They had an identity.
---
I would highly recommend checking out the VODs on his channel, there's something very therapeutic about watching this guy play

but how will Bliz know?
---
Yeah, I'm 4-6 on weekdays. I'll go 8 on weekends.
---
Should have just waited another month and a bit for classic.
---
Retail is fine to get into for an okay rpg feel but you need to go..back.. in any franchise to get a real feel.
---
Thanks!
---
After reviewing a couple old video's it indeed does appear to be a static transformation. Ever race ended up having the same exact appearing when used.
---
&gt;A healer and tank is kind of the foundation.
---
will using a hunters pet as a tank get me far?
---
You'll both be after a lot of the same gear but it will only be a problem if there's jealousy issues.
---
Lol all these noobs thinking DW warriors will tank.  Warlocks can have more health and do more damage.  Top guilds will undoubtedly be running a Warlock MT, maybe with a DW fury to hand trash.
---
Yes, very item indeed, thanks a lot!
---
I wish the bow creaking noise weren't a thing in watching hunters play WoW.
---
It's like nails on a chalkboard to me.. Have tried to fall asleep to joana's videos a bunch and that is what gets me out of bed to shut it off, literally that's it.
---
Human or dwarf for pally havent quite decides yet
---
Iirc Joana also had around 13g when he was Lvl 39. Not sure if he spent gold on something abnormal during the run or if that's just the result of getting as much xp as possible and not even looting most mob kills.
---
Not knocking what he's done. The man is a machine. Just pointing out that kind of leveling method does have some drawbacks.
---
Yea, min maxing is definitely something that exists though, it's just me though, I grew out of it
---
And here goes am upvote for making me laugh. Thank you
---
Get an alt to 35 for transmutes if that's the case.
---
I personally an not a fan of that spec for pvp or pve. Watch bloodskulls channel on YouTube. He had a near bis enhance shaman and he even has tutorial videos to help maximize its potential. He was a strong pvper who did well against the best of them.
---
No this isn't how it works. Its a single modifier they are applying to all the increases. No one knows what it is. From the one sample provided it maybe a -3% FLAT crit chance reduction, but that is unlikely.  Its also not just 3%, because those numbers in no way add up.
---
One they told us its not per aura, two if it was just 3% less of increased crit that would NEVER equal 3% less TOTAL crit. 3% of 5% increase is 0.15% You aren't going to hit -3% total from this. 
---
Note they didn't say WHAT the modifier is, its more like 10-15% less per +level increased crit. It could be a -3% flat modifier tho, meaning stacking crit to the max or not at all are the best bests.
---
Is that how much bar cooldowns were on private servers? I seem to remember on classic they were something like 50g?
---
&gt;Does this server have any popular streamers on my faction?
---
&gt;Is the server high population on my faction?
---
If either of these is yes, not picking that server.
---
*rushes to 60 and first raid in 1 week*

"I knew classic would die within a year, no new content."
---
Here we go again.
---
Chad is right. Dont be virgin minmaxer, there is bfa version for that
---
I'm going to level tailoring and skinning on my mage, farm gold and drop skinning at 60 for engineering. 
---
I'm hoping I can be pooled some cloth from my guild early on though and start making bags pretty early.
---
Slay alliance scum...
---
Joana is a great guide writer (mostly for players new players or people that havent played the game in a while), but his mechanics are stuck in the past and he can't play that much anymore because hes got healthy problems.
---
nah, most of your gear will come from questing anyway, only dungeon loot will be contested. but you're likely to have a priest in your group even if you're a solo mage anyway since it is probably the most played healer class.
---
for leveling i'd personally go frost aoe build and holy smite/nova build. that way you could do some big AoE pulls, have good heals, and smite spam single target.
---
They didn't say that. 
---
&gt; I’ll say that this is not a per-aura modifier and it is separate than the 3% suppression that is baseline against +3 level creatures. There is a single modifier placed on total Critical Strike gained from auras that increase Crit chance such as those I listed in my last post.
---
Blue specifically stated its not a basic 3% suppression applied to auras and that its another single modifier, But he isn't saying what it is.
---
The most reliable way to fix the "psychological roadblocks" is by fixing diet and exercise. You just have to do it. Then you'll feel better, and won't want to stop doing it.
---
You can heal dungeons in any spec as long as you have the int/spirit gear (even cloth) in your backpack.  Feral has an even better time doing it than say, a Shaman, because of the mandatory feral talent Heart Of The Wild, which gives you 20% extra intellect.
---
It doesn't matter.  People today can push buttons on keyboard better and faster than players in 2006.  People today know how to use search engines to learn things about the game, whereas the internet hadn't even been invented yet in 2006.  
---
Between people's ability to push buttons better, and their ability to use search engines, Classic literally has no chance of not being 100% beaten within the first 96 hours.
---
Just cut both in half of their current values and it would be near perfect in my opinion.
---
I dont believe it bad behaviour. They tried to recreate vanilla with the same mechanics. So down the road eventually we get classic with what the private servers were trying to do?
---
Did you fall on your morning wood or something? Dood you need to relax. Appreciate what private servers brought us. Thank you son.
---
We’ll 100% be going for a week 2 rag kill. 
---
It’s so hard to tell if we have a shot, but the guild is built from a core group of members from private servers and a lot of us are taking time off.
---
Week 3 is a guaranteed rag kill in my eyes, but I wouldn’t be shocked if we did it Week 2.
---
Wow you really just denied a moonkin how could you
---
LETS COMMIT A WAR CRIME BROTHERRRRR
---
Yes that could be. People will find out over time.
---
wtf does this have to do with pservers?
---
That’s fine, but this 95% stuff is just not even close.
---
That doesn't make sense.  How is the damage received in a 5 sec window the same if the tank is much more likely to get parried in that window?
---
Fury tanks lose again
---
I enjoyed this immensely, thank you for sharing.
---
Pick what you want to look at.
---
This exactly
---
Got a source on that? I haven't played on any for a while.
---
When I first started in retail vanilla, I was invited to play with two real life friends, so my server was chosen for me.
---
This go around, I am just picking the first PVE server that I come across as I don't have anyone pulling me into a server. A small caveat would be if any of my current BfA guildmates want to play on Classic, and then I'll just go with them.
---
Long story short, I am a follower unless left to myself.
---
I'm hoping Alamo talks like Dives.
---
* Professions
---
* Dungeons
---
* Grinding for epic mount
---
* Possibly levelling an alt
---
It all depends on what you mean by "hardcore".  I don't think a laid-back guild is likely to recruit a roster ahead of the game's launch.
---
Such a shame, it sounded like such a cool system on paper 
---
I could imagine there being like leatherworkers trying to rebalance the population of various animals so they could harvest certain mats etc. Could have been pretty cool
---
Honestly, the level scaling was a good thing to add, nobody ever quested anymore because of 2 main reasons, dungeoning was faster, and you would outlevel zones way too fast and you wouldnt be half way through a zone and everything would be green and close to turning grey, so you spent alot of time tracelling between the zones that you would only get a quarter of the way through. That isnt an issue anymore, you can actually quest through an entire zone and see the full zones story now. Stuff being the same level as you really doesnt matter, even in classic you want things to stay the same level as you, ideally.
---
I liked how they made Tanks an essential part of PvP. Being able to block doorways and have a healer behind you keeping you alive was a great part of the seiges.
---
Or how Tanks could choose a player to share damage with and taunt in PvP.
---
Honesty in advertising.
---
Everytime you read a speedrunning post you wonder why the comments are about speedrunning....

There's countless posts on this sub about taking your time.  Maybe read those instead.
---
I'll find this house in Ashenvale. Provided it's not the one we need to like fly to get to.
---
He applied to be a moonkin, we do have a raid slot open for one, just not for an obvious troll, haha.
---
Unfortunately not. This most likely still isn't enough to dethrone us, as much as I wish for it.
---
Suggest exploration. I think this is one thing that WoW ias amazing for - finding those little nooks and crannys that are often left unattended by the populace.   
---
Exploring Azeroth was one of my greatest joys growing up as a young kid/teenager and solely the reason I only made it to level 47 during Vanilla.
---
Are you seriously asking that question? The word "GREED" isn't self-explanatory for you, are you serious?
---
It's not nuanced, at all. 
---
How many is this "many others", do you think? Because this is how it worked in Vanilla. So what evidence do you have that it will be different? And what evidence do you have that most people will think it makes sense that "the greed button is essentially useless, so let's roll need on anything"? Because that makes NO sense. The greed option is literally for rolling on things you want to sell...
---
Yep my example is an anecdote, in the sense that it was a singular example.  But it's also how all the other boe rare drops were handled, so it's just how it is done.
---
I don't know who these "many others" are, but I don't seem to see them in-game, anywhere. Not in Vanilla. Not in pservers. Not anywhere. 
---
Maybe your "method" is something you would *like* to use, so you can never be ninjaed from... But I don't actually see anyone using it. 
---
Why is it fair they get to use something that dropped? Because everyone in the group is hoping to get things they can use, that drop. That's the whole fucking point of the group/doing the dungeon, etc. Why is it fair YOU get gold, instead of someone getting an upgrade, which is exactly what they're trying to do? 
---
Of course it's logical. The whole point of doing the run, the dungeon etc. **is to get upgrades**. So for someone to want an upgrade, which is the expected outcome of doing a dungeon run, is certainly logical. I'm sad for you that this even needs to be explained to you.
---
If you couldn't prove someone wouldn't sell an item, then of course I would agree with you. But that's not the case. You just make sure they equip it after they win. That's how it is done.
---
Seeing as how this impacts everyone. It imo doesn't impact them at all. It just impacts everyone the same. (in relative terms)
---
PTSD what they did to hunter.  RIP
---
We are talking about "of the X" greens here, not blues or boss drops, fedora lord. Those are not worth the effort I suppose you played in more toxic circles.
---
Nothing.
---
Just curious but was this behaviour reflected on PS?
---
I'm still amazed anyone can read them without getting a headache.
---
Great content, poor execution in text format.
---
Just shift into cat to fit through the doors.
---
Well there was that time you guys were wrong about parry chance
---
By a factor of like five
---
I think you are confused, I advocate for greed rolls, which makes room for need rolls, so people who NEED the upgrade can roll for it without extra steps. What part was I unclear about?
---
Delicious Milf
---
Dirty dirty troll.
---
Depends how you're planning on playing.
---
If you're minimizing your time /played to 60, don't do engi or tailoring; pick skinning + herb/mining, and don't bother trying to sell stacks of leather until you're a bit higher level (&gt;30 I think). Since you don't have to pay for your mount at 40 on a warlock, it's better to just keep your gathering profs skill levels up to date as you level but wait until you're higher level to really farm since until 60, you only need to pay for bags and spells and at 50+ you can make a lot more g/hour.
---
Regarding option 3, yes the bloodvine set is BoE, but it requires 300 tailoring to equip, so you can buy it but you still need to be a tailor.
---
As for mining vs herb for a gathering profession if you decide not to take tailoring, depending on how seriously people on your server take flask/pot usage, it's totally possible that herbalism will make more gold per hour than mining. It may be better to farm herbs, sell them, and then use that money to buy ore. The down side is that if the market is low on something you need, you have to pay inflated prices whereas if you have mining, you can just go farm whatever specific thing you want.
---
I would let the character influence my decision, too; it is an (mmo)rpg after all. Does your warlock seem more likely to learn the properties and value of different plants that can be used for good or evil? Do they feel like the type to craft garments of great power? That sort of thing. It's nerdy but whatever.
---
Wat
---
There are items like "tablet of lightning bolt II" (requires level 12) and "tomb of lesser invisibility" (requires level 26).  Interesting to see some of the cut items.
---
It's really better for melee. The weapons were BiS until Naxx. Armor was super Stam heavy, but raid gear gave more attack power/hit and crit.
---
I did the rank 11 grind on a rogue and priest. Rogue was my main, while the 14 weapons would have been nice, my raid gear was better. I was doing MC and BWL alt runs with my Priest. Got a staff of shadow flame.
---
You compare [Staff of Shadow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19356) to the [rank 14 staff](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18873)
---
You basically traded 20 some Stam for 2 crit.
---
How does this pass the low effort meme threshold
---
Much better than the gun shoot sounds, my god.
---
This makes a lot of sense. I always thought Warriors felt stronger in raids on pservers than vanilla. Figured it was people playing better. It's that for sure but lowered crit on bosses is huge for DPS races IMO in early and later phases.
---
You're better off asking on dual-boxing.com. Reddit is kind of anti-multiboxing. Needless to say I'll be going warrior+3 mages+paladin. I don't plan on doing much pvp, but I think it would be fun and challenging to solo all the 5 man content and do so efficiently
---
Farm rank 11, mounts are a lot cheaper and you get unique black mounts.
---
I had a really fun time on a private server a few months ago arguing that Warcraft was inspired by Evangelion and this proved the superiority of Japanese culture (and masculinity).
---
Here on reddit
---
Holy hell, RIP his butt
---
Hahaha that was good!
---
"Need all boes".
---
Come back when you are capable of reading
---
Not as a whole, but most of it. The items and abilities that give +ap won't contribute to blood fury. Anything that increases strength however will contribute.
---
good effort and commitment to the bit 8.5/10, would be higher but it's obviously a troll. Subtlety is hard to master
---
Interesting, so essentially against raid bosses you have -3% crit. 
---
&gt; **There is some code in 1.12 that explicitly adds a modifier that causes the first 1% of +hit gained from talents or gear to be** ***ignored*** **against monsters with more than 10 Defense Skill above the attacking player’s Weapon Skill.** 
---
Also, the 2nd blue post makes me very confused on how hit cap works. It seems the base hit cap is 8%, but an additional 1% is needed when your enemy has more than 10 defense over your weapon skill. Therefore, against a raid boss which is level 63 has 315 defense, which is 15 over 300 weapon skill thereby making the hit cap against raid bosses 9%. Makes sense. However, where I'm confused is I keep reading all these warrior guides saying that if you have 305 weapon skill (humans/swords/maces, orc/axes), you only need 6% hit to reach the hit cap. However, by Blizzard devs explanation 305 weapon skill against a 315 defense enemy would only reduce the hit cap from 9%-8%. What am I missing here and where is the math that explains an extra 5 weapon skill translates to an extra 3% hit?
---
The subreddit class survey put undead warriors in a very small minority with orcs at first and tauren second. WOTF is redundant with death wish and berserker's rage, not that it's completely useless even considering that. Berserker's rage is stance locked and death wish is a talent so there are definitely scenarios where WOTF is superior.
---
Just going by what you wrote: regular questing will be the majority of your experience and finding nearly dead players will be a rare event. Just because you can't heal people doesn't mean you can't bail them out as a warrior.
---
Need/Greed wasn't actually a thing from day 1. 
---
There was only Roll/Pass 
---
They retrofit Need/Greed due to popular demand, and thus it didn't have the consideration/iteration/polish that so much of the game did.
---
So in Vanilla I had a great time with my Undead Shadow Priest.  I healed 5 mans.  Had half my dungeon .5 set. 
---
Do I repeat this or do i mix it up with a warlock or rogue?
---
I liked always having a 5-man spot, but will i get burned out on doing the same again?
---
No, you want those things. Insane that I even need to explain this to someone. 
---
I know what gold does, bro. And that's literally what the GREED ROLL, is for. For when you want to sell an item, instead of use it. Holy shit that you can't understand this.
---
Wow that's just ridiculous that you think a pug is going to sell and split the proceeds of the future sale of some random item. This isn't your group of friends, it's a pug. Making sure people equipped the boe is what keeps people honest.
---
It's not "my definition". Its the definition of the vast majority. Did you even play Vanilla? We're not talking about theoreticals here, about how some new game's economy will work. Were talking about how it used to work in Vanilla. And how it works *right now* in pserv. 
---
So, rage against that machine kiddo, but if you need roll on something and don't use it immediately, you will be called a ninja looter. Because that's the definition of a ninja loot.
---
Ok, good luck getting anyone to join your group, but you can certainly try to make a group with any rules you want. But mark my words. I'm no "pedant". You're the one who is ridiculously trying to *get rid* of the fucking greed button, by telling everyone to roll need on boes. Insane. But good luck :D
---
hmmm, that's a good point. i'm more into world pvp, but i'll definitely take that into consideration/think this over some more
---
Where does one find raid guilds pre-release?
---
No, just no. Copper farming runs in durotar, dancing on mailboxes in ironforge spamming 'tips plz', skinning nuetral critters, selling low level buff food. There are tons of ways to make money that are worse then grinding in the open world, including grinding in worse parts of the open world. The trick with any farming method is to go in with a plan and efficient execution. Yes, there are better ways to farm, and if you want to measure the efficiency vs JUST open world farming, then that is fine, you can set that as your zero. There are a fair number of non mob grinding methods that will be above that zero, but there will also be way more methods of getting gold that are under zero.
---
See I hate the sound of water in the game, it’s the same loop over and over, and sucks when you have to turn off ambiance when fishing.
---
I didn't really "feature" I do mention the "raid" stuff though.
---
What part? If you factor in UBRS / LBRS sure, but those are technically raids, not 5 mans. Sure they operate as a "dungeon" but you have to form a raid to clear them.
---
Except that he plays like a boomer, backpedals constantly and is like 10 hours slower paced than other speedleveling hunters on the beta. We love the guy but there are players doing this so much better and faster now. His popularity comes from his fame during vanilla so I get why he’s popular but he’s not particularly fast anymore...
---
Yeah, I only mentioned warriors because the example being used was berserker stance
---
Not 100% sure, but i think Joana said on his stream that his 1-60 alliance guide will be ready by the time classic launches
---
This wasn't a troll post. I legit want a guild with dudes only. :((((
---
weird flex but ok
---
It's easier to just buy the runecloth and do gold farming with something else.
---
I enjoyed it for an inverse reason: people in good pve gear who suck at pvp still get their asses kicked by good pvpers with okay gear.
---
I’m more impressed with someone with a high pvp rank in meh gear than someone with a terribly low pvp rank in the best gear.
---
You might be the most literal person on the planet (or I'm just getting trolled). Of course by the strictest, most narrow definitions these won't be world firsts, but I think 99.9% of the wow community (maybe everyone except for you) understands the concept that people are trying to convey when they talk about the upcoming race to world first; it's a pretty reasonable naming convention. I think you're most likely being unreasonably pedantic to draw this hard line on inauthentic world firsts, but hey no one can make you accept these as the new records. On a side note, I would love to hear your opinion on how many championships the Green Bay Packers have ACTUALLY won lol.
---
Nothing I listed drops from Dire Maul. When WoW Classic launches Dire Maul won't be available so I omitted the gear from there.
---
I'm picking a PvP server because I can't enjoy the game without the looming danger of PvP combat. The quest you finished, that herb you picked, and that mob you killed mean so much more when you did it in a dangerous zone.
---
Even if I don't plan to engage in PvP, the war makes the server feel so much more alive.
---
Depending on your leveling speed and time commitment to WoW Classic after launch, guide writers like Joana, the folks from Azeroth Autopilot or WoW-Pro are likely to have completed the missing guides before a lot of us get even close to level 40.  In terms of continuity and switching between guides, in-game addons are likely to get better at figuring out quests and quest chains that you have already completed.  First version of WoW-Pro was already pretty good.  
---
Frankly, I believe most can level just fine without a guide.  More useful than a guide is an addon that just highlights quest givers and quest objective areas.  Depending on build, luck with drops and personal preference to run dungeons, PvP or pursue some professions, you’ll need to customize and improvise anyway along the way to 60.
---
Oh really? Thanks!
---
Yeah anyone familiar with him knows this is the case
---
He's gone through a lot of health issues and is older now , as well as the level of player being so much higher it's just obvious he's not the best of the best anymore, however he's still faster than 99% of the community.
---
Good leveling tips and tricks can be learned from watching him a bit, but I wouldn't expect to Learn everything you need to know about the game
---
Indeed. If you play character that takes 200ish hourse to level (no honestly I dont care if you can do it faster), you should feel invested in it. I dont have a problem there personally, im a druid, blizz made the choice for me.
---
Reason why there are opposite reactions is that there are both Virgin minmaxers and Chads around. Virgin minmaxer will feel invested in his character because it gives him that sweet 5% more intellect. Chad will play his human warlock because he looks cool and he knows warlock T1 on human is just pure oomf
---
So you simply have to decide what person you are. Virgin Minmaxer or Chad Immersion? And base your race choice on that
---
Druid fc has a really high skill cap and takes a long time to be efficient.
---
Man you still said no after that epic response? Holy shit he dodged a bullet on you guys! Lol
---
If I do that I can’t take frostbite right? Isn’t that a big dps loss since I won’t crit as much?
---
Less crits = less rage = less damage. Good.
---
[removed]
---
league of legends had that too, where any spell penetration that went past their spell resistance would count as bonus damage. The problem with that was that it scales in the wrong direction, so its super effective on targets that zero armor (newbies) and not very effective on targets with super high resistance (the specific thing it counters). 
---
to be fair, armor works like that I think. If you do armor debuffs on someone they wont go below 0 armor
---
His point is that in a 1-60 speedrun this isn't viable due to not being able to afford your mount. The guy who  gets world record will play like this,  but he'll also have a guild of people funneling them gold.
---
I'm joining one of those guild exactly for the drama and arguments. I'm hoping all shit hits the fan in the first couple of weeks while I've quietly made a few bros and when it all falls to bits I've got a good core group to make our own guild with together for shits and giggles.
---
You need rank 1, all abilities from talents work like this if it has ranks.
---
Fair, I guess I should reword it to any zone below level max. So for example, in TBC say your in a decent guild clearing the second tier raids on normal with a few heroic kills from time to time.  Were you to walk through hellfire peninsula you should basically one most all creatures and any player not level cap. With this new system that’s not case, you may be strong but nothing compared to how strong you should be relative to how far you have progressed. I feel like very few veteran players like scaling zones, it kills the since of progression imo
---
Hah ditto, I'm going hunter/priest.
---
Liebesbrief
---
Wouldn't it be more efficient to have money for your mount right at 40 though? (Genuine question, not a speedrunner.)
---
There was always an enh Shammy in the raids I ran. Maybe not in the worlds first groups, but I'm highly skeptical that many, if any, here are to be included within that caliber of player.
---
The YouTuber hakurai made an alliance leveling guide where you end with 300 in 4 professions at level 60. It isn’t a speed leveling guide but it is pretty quick.
---
yea i think so it prob wont work. I just read recently about how rogues could stealth first before activating the trinket so you stealth underwater as a fish with increased swim and underwater breathing. Sounded so fun so i was hoping maybe a druid could prowl in cat form while being a fish sounds insane ik lol.
---
Google a bit for dual boxing and isboxer.   There are forums out there with lots of multiboxers who have been doing this for a long time.  
---
With a bit of patience and macro skills, you can multi box even very diverse tank, healer, DPS groups.  Dual boxing tank/DPS, tank/healer, DPS/healer is all fairly straight forward, easy and viable. 
---
Back during actual vanilla, I picked my multiboxing setup based on either how I wanted to multibox at 60 (for me it was dungeon runs) or individual characters I wanted to play separately at 60 but level together (for me that was tank/healer).  And of course, many of us tried 5 shamans because it was just funny as hell.
---
you can always just buy an epic mount for race.
---
His mechanical skill is pretty low, though. He doesn't know how to auto shot correctly for example. He runs up to the mob and casts serpent sting before he auto shots which is a pretty big DPS loss.
---
It's a world drop epic, it's going to be like 300g at bare minimum.
---
Even absolute meme weapons like Hand Of Edward The Odd were going for 1k gold around the "phase 2" of a recent pserver.
---
&gt;Also, who cares if someone "no life's" it?
---
My point is that the group of people you're talking about is very small. You're saying "well, it's a long time to phase 2"....yes, for the &lt;5% of players who no-life their way to 60 in a month.
---
Druid is very viable as both a tank and a DPS with high effort. Look up powershifting cocerning feral DPS. You will need to farm a ton of potions and really mash buttons to keep up but it's possible. As a bear tank guilds usually have one as they don't fight for gear and are even preferable to warriors on certain fights i.e. those with primarily elemental damage where armor mitigation doesn't matter. Druid healers are taken for the same reason — druid stuff will drop and may as well have somewhere to go, even though your BiS gear is the same as the other healers. At naxx resto druids get a lot better because of a specific idol. Druid DPS is doable but requires **a lot** of preparation and button mashing. Look up powershifting if you want to know more.
---
The main duty of a tank is not mitigation, it's threat. Paladins simply do not generate enough threat outside of undead dungeons like Stratholme. Retribution paladins are really terrible at DPS and chances are if your guild is permitting them you'll have a bunch of other memers taking raid slots and making everything harder than it has to be. Your peak progression comes into question at that point. No doubt someone will have an anecdote about clearing Naxx on some private server with a bunch of Oomkins and enhancement shamans and ret paladins but rest assured these are extreme exceptions and the bulk of the raid were meta classes carrying them.
---
I'll pick the one with the least obnoxious streamers.
---
Doesn't it count for casters too?
---
So, for Rogues, does agility also increase AP?
---
Mm. All fair points. I'm still going to get it though.
---
I feel rank 10 isn't the end of the world to get. It's a matter of how much you want to poopsock it.
---
Yeah meth keeps you awake but I don't care about world first, I just want my time in game to be more efficient. /played doesn't count time offline lol
---
Only problem being you and over half the population will be following said guide. Making it pretty much the worst route you could take.
---
Noone will solo kill them
---
Thats hoe it works. I noticed the same with FFF (sigh, Feral Fearie Fire)
---
That will be true for the world FIRST level 60 probably, but I’m guessing they will put rules on the /played world record that doesn’t allow assistance from others.
---
Yeah, so rogues get 1 ap per str, 1 ap per agi. Wars get 2str per str and 0 per agi. I'd assume blood fury works similar for rogues in that it benefits from str and agi since both generate ap.
---
Yeah, I didn't remember them being that high. I was getting materials for my heartseeker and remember spending a few hundred gold to make it.
---
Dwarf rogue gets a pass in my book.
---
Since you're obviously not going to be speed leveling I would suggest you just really enjoy the experience and take in all the sights and beauty that the world has. The quests, the dungeons, the scenery, and find a good guild of friendly people in a similar situation.
---
How is anyone going to hit level 60 and get geared and then clear MC in the first or second week? There’s no way that is possible.
---
Blizz could stretch layering until Phase 2 drops, then they'd have to create new realms and offers free transfers.
---
What do you get for getting a lot of them?
---
I am incredibly glad this is a resource, thank you for this
---
They already said layering can't exist in Phase 2 due to world bosses.
---
Literally, there were ilvls. Nobody is talking about any scaling.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss
---
Idk why your getting downvoted. The post you responded to shows a lot of ignorance.
---
They already said it won't be possible to have layering in Phase 2 due to world bosses.
---
Maybe..........
---
WHO ARE YOU?!
---
Don't know about each one, but after grinding to AV exalted as a resto druid for the healing offhand, I would, and will do it again. Druids can cleanse poisons/curses, run away, and stealth. While these things are great utility, I like druid healing. It feels more mobile than the other classes, and fights are generally shorter, so hots are used more liberally than in raiding.
---
Absolutely were item levels.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?items=2.15#0-2+1
---
Sort by level. It's not the same as what it is today, but it denoted higher tiers of gear.
---
But,but,but layering!
---
Lol there is always that one person who just can't not comment something negative.
---
No, I did not. He is clearly very unintelligent, which invalidates anything he says.
---
If you visit the trainer the rank2 and above spells will be visible on the list but will be red and untrainable, once you talent into it the other ranks will then be available to purchase.
---
if you respec you lose them and need to re-train them every time you re-talent into such spells.
---
But your brain did.
---
Number 8 pepelaugh!
---
Because world PvP was dead in TBC? Arena and BGs are meaningless in comparison to wPvP.
---
&gt;Bugs will be fixed in time, don't sweat.
---
Right now the major exception is melee leeway, which according to blue posts will not change.
---
Pretty sure if everybody rolls need on a boe epic and one of those people win it that's not ninja looting but hey you can think what you want.
---
That can't be true. Why would he go Disc when Shadow Priest is way better.
---
As a warrior who play pvp I can give you a honest opinion 
---
Tauren are better in pvp since you have more hp and that help a lot, for example if you have 6k hp it’s going to be 6300 maybe it seems a little but it make a huge impact in pvp
---
War stomp is your second pummel since you only have one kick and it helps a lot vs mages, priest and warlocks too 
---
The hitbox didn’t know about intel beta came out and I found it very useful especially when you are getting kited by a rogue or mage
---
You started off okay, but some things are repeats (I see professions twice), many things are arguable (I prefer PvE and PvP gear personally for example) and some are just straight idiotic (my guild is cheering...really?).
---
i've actually done the galaxy brain one before lol
---
Bullshit
---
Was also wondering this to be honest. I'm sure there's recruiting going on in pservers and Discord and such, or just old friends.
---
That's 43.5 hours for anyone wondering - 
---
43.5 hours to 40 IF you are a hunter, playing on a dead layer and know what your doing.
---
See y'all at 60 in 10 days!
---
Who gives a shit?
---
Whats the difference between 6. And 23.?
---
If it's 7% for BoE recipe and you need full epic aka 2-3 month after release there will be hundred of them already circulating
---
I believe it's everyone's crit chance. But this does more directly effect fury as opposed to other classes because of Flurry uptime.
---
Idk a lot of people who never played vanilla are exited.
---
You're not using the word meme correctly at all.
---
So what you're saying is that you know nothing about vanilla WoW.
---
Druids can be good at healing and DPS, just not the best. But they can be absolutely amazing at tanking in vanilla WoW. Many of world best guilds have a few feral tanks in AQ40 and Naxx because of how god tier druid is for tanking while also being way easier to gear than a warrior. Druids can tank Naxx with some blue gear still on and some BoE epics and MC-BWL epics, while a warrior needs to be fully Naxx geared to be equally good at tanking.
---
Thanks, I'll go stick with Warrior. Best of luck to you
---
Why?  Curious.
---
If the account doesn't belong to you... you shouldn't be on it.
---
Plain n' simp.
---
There were no memes back in vanilla.
---
I have no idea what you just said
---
Other classes have bonuses on crit too
---
Most delusional statement in this boards history. World PvP was THE major, number 1 main thing about vanilla WoW. It was the very core of vanilla WoW.
---
&gt;BC was hands down the best version of wow
---
Not even close. From an objective viewpoint it was terrible compared to vanilla, which was the best version of WoW. It had a few improvements but mostly ruined previously way better game design.
---
Ya but there is no aura around the arrow so
---
If you don’t understand why it probably doesn’t affect you.
---
It's impossible to get parried 250% more in a 5 second window. Maybe over the whole fight... but not a 5 second window
---
you can download it now - the last stress test used the wow classic client that you can get by clicking "version" on the wow page in battle.net and selecting wow classic. the final stress test will probably use that too
---
These streamers are salty as fuck man, it's hilarious.
---
I don't even dislike streamers but if you're gunna give this kinda reaction to a game then of course you're gunna get focused on. I can understand the frustration of someone ruining your tournament that you've planned but honestly they seem to put so little effort into it with all the technical issues they had that it's hard to feel sorry for them. All these guys that took part in the tournament think they are gods at the game yet they couldn't stop one guild from griefing them
---
If it was me, I'd pay APES as security to keep other grievers away.
---
RPPvP mah dude. But good luck to you.
---
Stop being an elitist and learn to enjoy life sometimes man. Not everything is a race.
---
he did in his speedruns in vanilla
---
Galaxy brain there works until it turns out the guy you ganked has an arms warrior decked in full T3
---
I feel this.
---
Porn me
---
Be the beast!
---
You are 100% right. That’s exactly what I am looking for.
---
I understand. 
---
First, it makes sense that if they are testing a layering system that they plan to hammer with thousands of people that they should test it aggressively in order to put it through its rounds. I would not be surprised if this is the case for all of the beta footage you and I have been watching.
---
Additionally, WoW these days is 10-25 man raids. Even if you have three 25 mans in a pvp area, it will be &lt;80 people. So I see why their phasing would kick in around 40-80. They probably just dont expect that many people to want to pvp together at one time.
---
I would not be surprised if 100-200 people in a zone scared the developers of 2004. But 15 years of server hardware and software upgrades will boost that number significantly. I believe zones can reliably handle 120-200 people in them. Probably even higher. Again, its a guess and I cant provide technical data to back that up. I can only provide anecdotal evidence that 120-160 people fighting over a world boss happened in vanilla--and it was fine for me and my computer.
---
He probably hasn't, I have mostly had good experiences grouping on the private servers. But any way to create a false sense of superiority.
---
A lot of people say that vanilla was the age of warrior but I would say that rogues aren’t far behind. 
---
In a 1v1 situation, a great rouge is the deadliest thing in vanilla. There’s tons of videos out there showcasing what a rogue with all their cool downs can do. A great rogue can beat just about everything in equal gear / skill in a 1v1. 
---
In group PvP they go from being the best to just really good. They still excel at damage, CC, and shutting down healers. They are a bit more vulnerable in world PvP which keeps them from being as broken, but still very strong.
---
That's my biggest worry. Children are so expensive I hope she sees reason when the time comes and we have a serious discussion about having them
---
On the plus side though you can still have demonic sacrifice active when you enslave demons.
---
Lots of good info, thanks for that.
---
I really hope they artificially introduce inconvenience barriers to the paid services including but not limited to transfer restrictions and long cooldowns. 
---
I have no logical basis for this opinion -- if you try to argue with me about it I won't be able to defend it, so consider this a concession in advance -- but it's my opinion.
---
"These guys are the biggest losers." - some guy who streams video games for a living.
---
Whenever I'm bored after I've done my dailies and WQ's I'll head to STV and mess around. I play a feral druid so I stealth around until I find a player of the same faction as me.
---
Then I just stick around for a while see what happens. Usually if I'm following a level 30-35, eventually a 40-45 or higher from the opposing faction will turn up and think the one I'm shadowing is an easy kill.
---
So I sit by and watch them fight it out but if the other faction (with a level lead) starts winning I hide behind a tree or something and throw a few heals on my factions guy to even the odds.
---
I don't ever get involved if the levels are the same, that's a fair fight and none of my business.
---
After 10 years of playing the game I still like hanging around STV and just watching people play and have skirmishes in the world, it's quite an active area.
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM) does a decent job laying out some reasons to avoid a streamer server.
---
I feel ur pain bro, I have that same problem!
---
And actually, Im on the same boat trying to decide warrior and rogue.
---
Originally I just let my girlfriend play my alts, she started getting really into the professions and liked gathering and progressing at her own pace. Enough to the point where she wanted to get her own account. We played on Molten private server at the time so she leveled up quickly and eventually decided on a Nelf Druid. After a couple months she was healing for wotlk dungeons and raids. It was rough in the beginning but once I installed thr healbot addon it made things much better. She was eventually able to heal through icecrown citadel.
---
Now you are just nitpicking.  They DID change the macro system to make it less powerful, in response to plenty of complaints about the automation that could be done with the vanilla macro system as well as to make it easier to work with. They also are not bringing back the old macro system which is further evidence that they prefer the current less powerful system, and I really haven't seen too many complaints about the lack of healbot or one button decurse/cleanse from the community despite those changes not being vanilla like.  Maybe just maybe there is some truth to what I am saying, and the macro system changes were made to counteract the simplification of playing the game through macros and addons and were not things the devs originally intended. Saying that because those things existed in vanilla and weren't instantly fixed means they were intended?  I think that's shortsighted especially seeing all the changes that have been made since to prevent the types of things addons and macros could do back then.  In any case I wasn't looking to devolve the conversation into discussions about Blizz intentions with macros or addons, just that there was an addon to fix the tooltip/icon/cooldown problem in vanilla 1.12 clients.  That's all.
---
If we're putting classic dates to the phases. I'd guess a longer first phase. But it's pretty quick after that.
---
* Phase 1: Release (Nov 2004)
---
* Phase 2: 4-5 months after release (1.3 March &amp; 1.4 April 2005)
---
* Phase 3: 2-3 months later (1.5 BG June &amp; 1.6 BWL July 2005) I'd say 3 months
---
* Phase 4: 2-3 months later (1.7 Sept ZG &amp; 1.8 Dragons Oct 2005)
---
* Phase 5: 3-5 months later (1.9 Jan AQ &amp; 1.10 March 2006)
---
* Phase 6: 3-5 months later (1.11-Naxx June &amp; August 2006)
---
So really, using the raids as the content drops as my guess...
---
* Phase 1: release
---
* Phase 2: 4 months after release
---
* Phase 3: BWL 3 months later
---
* Phase 4: ZG and Dragons 2 months later, because this was a catch up phase where ZG bridged the gap of MC and BWL and made raids more accessible and PUGable.
---
* Phase 5: AQ gates 3 months later since gate opening means instance really opens 4 months later
---
Phase 6: 4 months later for naxx release
---
Well I believe for server transfers the no pve to pvp rule is in place.
---
Is that what she said?
---
Saying other people are on welfare while taking donations for playing a video game gg
---
Yea playing 60 out of 48 hours would be savage.
---
I'm not going to rush to 60, but it's fun picking up tips on how to level from speed runners.
---
The top pvp server in alphabetical order.
---
Some responses:
---
I fixed the professions repeat; 
---
no shit things are arguable -probably why it says "I" at the beginning...;
---
sorry the thought of a guild cheering for someone who got a great drop they've been wanting for weeks sounds idiotic to you - it doesn't to me (again, the "I" at the beginning of the list is important).
---
That's just how it is, some people don't need english for their daily lives, they are amongst themselves, why would they bother? Brazilian don't get servers, ignored as they are by Blizz, so when NA servers come up and that's their only option, why the fuck would they make the effort? Seems pretty clear to me.
---
Honestly, the streamers should just man up and release which server they're going to play on. The fans that are flooding there will do so anyway when the info is released. Not like someone is gonna have a level 5 char on a different server and say "Well, I already rolled here. No turning back now."
---
Wife her
---
This is just a good example of language evolving. It use to be used that way and possibly in specific groups it is used that way. Just shows how quickly definitions change in the age of the internet.
---
Because leeway doesn't remove the feeling of server community.
---
Deathbringer is amazing, and its DPS is greater than listed due to the higher upkeep on crusader. As an Orc, you'll have Windfury, so that absurd speed is going to make Deathbringer far better than any sword all the way to Naxx anyway.
---
Being able to BiS your mainhand weapon so early is awesome, and makes Axe spec better than the others imo. Less fun for upgrades though; I get that.
---
You versus the guy your girlfriend tells you not to worry about.
---
I’d argue that long term strategy is more important than looking like the uber PvPer that hops around for no reason for speedrunning.
---
I couldn’t do that nowadays. Family and full time job. RL has taken over. Ten years ago. Pft I’d be there with those guys.
---
Oh wow I completely forgot they had server transfer cooldowns!
---
VANILLA IS SO EASY GUYS
---
*editors note: every class has a built in +3% crit trinket*
---
Oh wow.
---
That cleared up most of my thoughts and questions.
---
Thanks you. 
---
Cheers mate
---
Nice video. What addon are you using for social ui?
---
Yea, in Cata me and a buddy ran heroics as Fury warrior and Shadow priest.  Tank and heals respectively.  We got a lot of hate till people saw no one died, and we topped dps.  
---
And in Classic I'm looking forward to not having a "traditional" tank, 3 dps, heal comp for early dungeons.
---
A temporary feature of which your claims aren't proven, thus you don't know the effect layering will have. Verses totally imbalancing melee/range and range verse mobs (even some melee vs melee line ups).
---
I'm not sure where it originated but it definitely has evolved in usage. The first place I heard it was episode 2 season 1 of doctor who. They used it in a sort of sci fi nuance way but they just described it as a repeating idea.
---
They have them on live -- 3 days -- which is fine when realms mean so little on live (i.e. LFD/sharding/etc. Character transfers serve only to permit guild membership, trading, and mythic raids) and could probably even be removed on live if not for technical reasons.
---
However, *in my opinion*, 3 days isn't long enough in Classic, where realms mean so much more.
---
I don’t have that option. Only the BFA PTR
---
If all cloth had 15% damage reduction in vanilla, I would expect it to be in classic... see how that works?
---
It seems the crux of your argument is that parry is irrelevant.
---
Yeah vanilla was way longer I have no idea what it was but 6 months stands out to me for some reason
---
meth?
---
to game?
---
TILL YOU DIE
---
I know you're joking but I'll jump in if the guy attacking is at such a level advantage that just healing the player of my own faction won't be enough for him to win.
---
I need more of this in my life. There are very few streamers who I don’t mind but I only really watch YouTube content; guides discussion and lore stuff mostly. 
---
I could watch the streamer rage all day
---
Permanent Archon from diablo 3 to my mage
---
Fear on a mage.
---
I was definitely just trying to be funny.
---
You've seen the movie though, right?
---
It would just crush my heart if you didn't get the reference.
---
Just lock them in a room with some water when you want to play.
---
\#nochanges This is how we ended up with the current mess of BfA
---
Not misleading really. It's 1 crit per 10 defense or mob level.
---
People say Adderall because it sounds like a fun college kid drug but it's just crystal meth that is more socially acceptable
---
Another person who thinks parry is irrelevant. interesting.
---
Vanilla and classic are going to be two completely different beasts.
---
I wonder how 6% less crit raid wide translate in terms of total raid dps.
---
Honor/rank system is interesting and I'm pretty sure most people that talk about it don't even know how it works.  It works by giving you points based on what percentile you are in your own faction.  So you need to get more honor than other people in your own faction.
---
Then probably the most important thing to understand when you are making your ranking push is that there is a % based decay every week.  Which means if you are going to rank, your slow honor weeks will hurt more later on than it would at lower ranks.
---
My wife said exactly this when she agreed to play. Let her figure it out. My response? Fine by me. Figuring it out is half the fun. See you at 60.
---
his addons listed here, not sure where he got them, google i guess or ask him when hes live
---
Leatrix Plus (Automatic quests/gossip)
---
QuestBindings (Bind gossip options/quest rewards)

SpeedRunSplits (Timer top left)
---
FiveSecondRule (Mana timer above swing)
---
WeaponSwingTimer (Ranged/Melee Timer)
---
most of the other speed runners are actually like shit. They have great time on dead servers or no competition.
---
Majority of those speed runners won't have those numbers they hit during launch day.
---
There are only a few who are taking actual accounts and making adjustments and intentionally taking time penalty for having smooth runs or accidently doing quests that realistically won't happened in launch day.
---
Joana approach is a very moderate and realistic approach for launch. 
---
Staysafe - while I will dispute his routes and reasonings for doing questional quests, is very realistic about his speed leveling for launch and is built around that. 
---
Check my post history where I have shared 3 data of my 3 speed run as a priest dwarf and still making more and more tweaks and improving on my time. Recently 1-20 in 11hr 17min where my worse 14hr 1min 7sec. Everything I have done is based on launch and what I can do safely w/o cost of downtime. Others I did with added time penalty because these will be quests I will probably have to join a group and take some xp loss, thus I gave myself penalty for solo XP that wouldn't happened on launch.
---
I have seen the film, but I do not get the reference.
---
All I remember is Tom Hanks shooting the tank with his pistol, the chaos at the start, all the sons dying which was the reason for the movies plot and uh matt damon doing his animorph bit at the end into an old man.
---
Apart from that I don't remember anything about it.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Agreed, but think it's all important. I complain lots about layering, but know it's not going anywhere. Just hope some happy medium balance is found.  
---
Leeway, take it down a couple yards. Spell batching, change it to like 250ms. Layering, better be there for only like 3 weeks.
---
Hellfire on any tank.. Just aoe everything while someone heals them
---
He's not suggesting changes he's talking pointless hypotheticals.  Keep up
---
I’m really not sure, but my entire life is a quest to figure out the root of my problems. One day at a time.
---
&gt;a lot of people will be 60 within a month    
---
I agree.   
---
People who play WoW now also like to level fast. Some people might take super long, but players who want to level up somewhat fast will be able to do it.  We even have AAP as a leveling addon to make it faster, if a player wants to use it.
---
The dwarven inns were easily the coziest, there is no denying.  The rooms were all in the basement with a big fire roaring in each room.  The inn and Kharanos was by far the nicest and I loved /sleep in an empty bed and logging out only to log back in and seeing two sometimes three others asleep on the bed as well.  Dwarf orgy? yes please.
---
For my warlock, shadowform.
---
Kharanos inn and Loch Modan inn were SUPER cozy.  I love the dwarven inns with the rooms in the basement.
---
Great video!
---
Love it. It’s like they’ve never played world of Warcraft before lol
---
Reading this comment is really funny if you know who xjum is
---
Then you haven't really watched people speedrun.
---
There are thousands of people who speedrun, and not many of them will ever get a world record. They do it for the fun of speedrunning and beating their personal bests.
---
Then they get queues.
---
He hasn't really done any WoW speed leveling since Vanilla, so he hasn't worked on actually playing, mostly just route work for his guide. He talked about it a few days ago, that he would have to practice more actual playing if he wants to get a good time and that people who have played years on private realms will get much better times than him.
---
I'd argue the guy w/o the mount would hit 60 first vs the one who got a mount.
---
Reason I state this - all smart speed levelers kills everything on their way to the next quest. Now the guy on the mount is going to be skipping free XP and it will actually hurt him, whereas the one who continues to grind is constantly keeping his XP per minute up.
---
By level 40, you should have almost all FP. Also as a hunter, free XP with sending ur pet while you're fighting another mob or moving to the next location.

---
Not necessarily in that order.
---
Rebirth for my druid &gt;&lt;
---
Not totally true man, I have seen plenty of casual raiding guilds not take meme specs into the guilds.
---
This is a very naiive outlook. Here is the thing: Players are relatively predictable. Blizzard can estimate how many players are going to log in on a given night, and know how soon below the 3k caps to spin out a new server to take in the new log ins.   
---
If they overprovision, they can just merge those few players \*once\*, and then that is their unknown layer hopping of the day. There is no reason to believe, unless you think the people behind WoW are bad at their jobs, that they will need to constantly layer hop people.
---
See, I don't find that to be a terribly strong argument. There are persistent aspects of WoW. Your gear persists. Your experience persists. The quests you do persist. You can't do that quest again. You can't 're-earn' level 23. Layering doesn't affect those things.
---
There are non-persistent aspects of WoW. Resource nodes, mob respawns, the entirety of dungeons. All repeatable, non-persistent content. Layering will affect most of these things, but they're already non-persistent, so what's the huge deal?
---
So, it falls down to other players being persistent or not. And your argument seems to be that seeing another player pop in/out will cause you to lose immersion; though seeing a quillboar pop up in your face after X minutes dead doesn't? Both are very clearly game mechanics. Both clearly remind us that it is a *game* we play.
---
Furthermore, you said you'd ask how many players would also be in the same zone that you can't see. I imagine for the first few weeks, that answer would be *too many*.
---
Consecrate for Prot warrior.
---
Nah.  He was just ~~last weeks rank 14 rogue~~.
---
It’s not a vlog. It’s supposed to be technical as he tries to get experts as guests. I am all for it. No need for random chatter
---
&gt; If I'm remembering correctly spells that crit only get +50% damage, not +100%.
---
Frost and destruction spells get talented up to 100. Also ignite, which is effectively 210%
---
Parries makes mobs attack faster. More parries, more incoming damage.
---
Plays like a boomer? O.o
---
95% of the girls play priest, the other 5% are druids
---
If you are only playing a little bit, warlock is much better. Feral MTs can be viable, but it's likely that in order to tank at all in raids you will need to be a high rank in your guild in order to have other players farm consumables for you (which won't happen if you only play a couple hours a night).
---
In my mind, raiding as a non-meta spec should only be undertaken by players with lots of time and commitment to offset their innate power with lots of effort. Anyone can show up 2x a week and spam frostbolt with prebis in MC. Only the most hardcore players should look to clear AQ40/naxx with anything other than meta specs.
---
I would suggest going Warlock and then rolling Feral if you find you don't like it. Worst case scenario you have an alt 60 with gold to buy you a mount or to farm consumables faster than a feral ever could.
---
Pros: Dwarf
---
Cons: Gnome
---
Yeah but the health risks in doing that. Fuck risking my life for a wow speed run record hahahaha
---
YTMND, now that's classic
---
Exactly this. Training for a speedrun is just like training for an IRL marathon. Most people don't run marathons expecting to break world records but enjoy the process regardless.
---
Pros: Gnome Cons: Dwarf
---
Just make everyone have 200+ ms. Keep it classic. #nochanges
---
you are fighting a strawman, nice try.
---
I’m lucky enough that when my wife asked me what we are doing for our anniversary and I said “nothing, I’ll be in Azeroth” she just rolled her eyes and called me a nerd.

---
I suggest you check out the "Druid vs Warrior Tanks" sections. Bears have plenty of downsides compared to warriors, but threat is not one of them. This is both due to the higher general base damage of druids, as well as the insane threat machine that is Manual Crowd Pummeler.
---
People not gonna like this comment but you're totally right. Unless the guy has some serious health issues which is unrelated.
---
People seem to only want number one to be who they listen to. No clue why. 99% of this sub and an even smaller fraction will compare with the top times that Joana puts out, let alone whoever beats him by sacrificing their health and pumping through on even shorter sleep schedules. But everyone here acts like they’re really all going to be doing what these top levelers are doing.
---
Player leeway was 100% in vanilla, exact same range as you are seeing in your first video.  Blue confirmed it working correctly.  People have replicated the positioning on private servers that have implemented leeway.
---
He's the asmongold knock off, right?
---
Mind wipe could also work if no one has a time machine
---
If it's an ability in game I'd take curse of exhaustion from for my Spriest but I'd rather just get dispersion back.
---
just reread the comments in order, it will make sense. Keep in mind when you say
---
&gt; I’m stating **why** people clamored for 400 ms spell batching. 
---
that this isn't telling me something I don't already know, so reread it, but keep in mind I knew that fact before you told it to me.
---
Repost.
---
he 's racing to 60
---
Whichever you role go tailor/herb IMO once you get your robes crafted you can drop tailoring like a bad habit and pick up alc while still making money off of your herbalism. Enchanting only is good to make yourself wands which is decent or you can just have a guildy make one or cough up the chump change you make from herbalism and buy one. Overall i just suggest having tailoring while leveling to keep yourself in the bag market for cheap, and it helps you for late game to get one of the Pre-raid BIS items for both classes. This is just my suggestion, but i have done this on both a warlock and a priest and it works out really well.
---
Night elfs and trolls, with a bit of orc and Tauren. 
---
Maining a troll female this time so that’s going to be fun.
---
I’m sorry you can’t be amazing at everything? Get your entitlement out of here
---
Right now we are at 1.7% penalty at 5% aura crit and at 3.0% penalty at I believe 9% aura crit.
---
Our current best guess in the discord we shall not speak of is losing around 1/3 of your aura crit to this penalty.
---
Its not right in any case. I cannot believe such a bad system was put in place.
---
The molested emo girls who cut themselves play rogues.
---
I understand your viewpoint but disagree, I mostly want unarmored mounts because I personally think that the lvl 40 mechanostriders look better than the level 60 versions, and would like to have a +100% unarmored mechanostrider
---
It's just plain better. There is plenty of analysis for buffs and so forth from like shaman, feral druids, ect. They just don't bring enough dps to make up for the loss of a real damage dealer. If buffs were raid wide it would be possible but it's small buffs and only for 4 others.
---
I don’t really see how someone playing the game in the way they find the most fun is missing the point.
---
Divine Shield for Priest would be sick
---
Innervate for Mage might be cool
---
Conjure Food for Warrior
---
Lay on Hands for Rogue would be insane
---
Dwarf Priests cultivate an atmosphere of lazy main tanks through fearward, are short, repulsive, not allowed on Tinder, and you are made to be everyone’s heal bitch. 
---
Gnome Warlocks have the distasteful voice acting of gnomes, look like gnomes, are animated like gnomes, and are nothing more than disgusting albino goblins. But, they are fun in PvP. 
---
So the answer is obviously Undead Rogue.
---
Isn't that cute? lol
---
Ah, custom game shenanigans.
---
I would recommend hunter based on that feedback. Hunters have a very high skill floor in both pve and PVP. As long as you're mindful of your pet's location and not multishotting CC'd mobs you'll be fine. They're an incredible casual battleground class and are also the best at leveling, so you'll be smooth sailing the whole way.
---
He just vomits on random viewers and zombies attack them en masse.
---
A mob lvl is +5 defense though
---
Life tap on a healer. Weave life taps between heals and you would never oom.
---
Another fun one would be an arms warrior with sinister strike.
---
Not on F R E S h, baby
---
Nah, I don't protest too much at all. To me, vanilla is a much better (and very different) game from retail. At this point it's apples and oranges, though, frankly.
---
This is all that needs to be said.
---
This has been confirmed by blizzard as correct. Idk why people still argue about it.
---
Level both by phase 2 and you won't have to decide.
---
Same boat here!  The impending Classic release has just wrecked me for almost any other games, except for some occasional rounds of Overwatch.
---
There's a lot of walking in circles, staring into space, looking forward to mundane chores like grocery shopping to kill some time, excessive masturbation and oversleeping.  Just waiting for Godot...err, I mean Classic.

*shadow priests
---
This is my problem with retail wow, they treat the players like idiots, and makeup excuses for obvious issues, instead of just fixing it, they hide the tail and that very much is some corporate bullshit...
---
Yeah stand your ground law applies right? STV is basically Florida
---
A consistent tank is the biggest gift you can give them. Dungeon groups are always bottle-necked by a shortage of tanks.
---
Fuck the racials go NE and front flip your ass all the way to rank 10 and naxx!
---
It’s actually crazy how two hours of playing on a vanilla private server, I had more random world player interaction than I ever had in legion. Just random people running by buffing, inviting for a nearby quest, emoting, etc.
---
Raiding MC as a fire mage is such a chad move. Only virgin mages go frost for MC.
---
Joana’s guide
---
They didn't say that.
---
&gt;    “Melee leeway” is working as intended.
---
After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006
---
See the word choice they, they never said it was the same they said how they would have experienced it. They are literally telling you its different, but should feel the same.
---
In this order:
---
Server Location -&gt; population size -&gt; faction balance (if information is available)  -&gt; PvP or PvE -&gt; which streamers are on it -&gt; the name of the server.
---
Right, which is why he is so amazing. He plays the game how most people would play, but shows how even the standard level of skill could get the results he does.
---
I mean, if you really look at the quests you're given, about 90% of them are just veiled excuses to grind mobs. Especially quests that make you get an item with a % drop rate or kill x things.
---
Hell, even "go get this thing" quests are often in areas where you need to clear your way to the objective. It was grinding all the way down in vanilla.
---
I think this is a problem of "working as expected" vs "working as intended." These effects were not intended in 2006 and shouldn't be intended now.
---
I think his real fame was 50/50. He was the record fastest but he was also the only person putting that much effort into it at the time. Complete speed runs multiple times, all committed to memory (he didn't write anything down as he says until he began the guide after videoing it).
---
Screen captured it all, then made a comprehensive product for thousands.
---
That's really his claim to fame - Joanna's GUIDE is what's famous, imo.
---
Sure, but he is the one who does it,  but also gives back.  I will celebrate the guy who is 7 hours slower, but presents a guide that many people will emulate and still have fun over the guy who just gets the number one spot.
---
Just like the people who say they’re better drivers when they’re drunk? Lol
---
Too busy supporting his fellow players by writing guides that appeal to the general leveler.
---
If I want to tank dungeons as a Paladin at 60, is reckoning worth it?
---
There is definitely more information about min maxing and it's more common than back in 2005. I played back then and my guilds still didn't take boomkin or enhance shaman. Although back then you couldn't just check someone's talents so I'd always raid boomkin and just pretend like I was a healer.
---
It's about beating your times. Only a small percentage of speed runners ever get wr...
---
I really don't mean to be rude, but "lists" like this seem to be every other thread...
---
Search up "Reasons why" and we have like 9 pages of this nearly exact same post lol
---
We get it, retail WoW is bad, Classic WoW is good and you're so excited you can barely contain yourself.
---
It's at around 3% at 14% aura crit too. Could be a cap. Could be class based (the 1.7% is from a paladin, the 3.0% are from warriors).
---
It's all speculation at this point.
---
Do you have trouble breathing through your nose? Deviated septum is a common problem requires surgery and 1 to 2 weeks off work. It's a simple recovery so you can still play games.
---
Have you visited barrens.chat? Is your 1-20 priest run taking advantage of darkshore? Do you make yourself a wand through enchanting? I ask because 11 hrs seems still about 3 hours longer than what should be achievable, but I haven't followed too closely on priest / alliance runs - I'm personally following tauren speed runs and druid specifically.
---
1v1 tho...
---
Evocation on Shaman
---
Sounds like you’re more excited for Nelf so you already made your decision, you just choose to debate yourself.
---
I think the important take-away for a new player is that every class is roughly the same to level. Barring hunter and to a lesser extent warlock

I suppose he/she means Vasectomy which is male sterilization

Petition Blizzard for a mutated NE/dwarf so you can do somersaults while your long braids are flying.

well said
---
Well, seems like a good plan.
---
Sure, I'd like some help. Im a beginner (only played WoW for 4 months mainly as Havoc DH). I want an "easy" class, with skill rotations that are not complex, not much responsabilities. I'll be playing around 4 hours per day. I dont care much for Tanking, because I think thats a role for more experienced players. I'll probably be most of the time playing solo.
---
His level 60 main and 2 bored guildies. Alliance love to 2 on1 more then hired ever has. Horde is more revenge influenced.
---
The other reason is he's very out of practice. He died maybe 30 times in his run. In his run in 2006 he didnt have a death until level 42.. This was his first real test run, the rest of his time is dedicated to his website, and routing.
---
If he ran it again, he'd probably take a few hours off.
---
No
---
Don't worry. Just 4chan kids trying to make new memes, nothing to see here.
---
Is it? I’m only basing my opinion on streams and friends that have access to the beta. So I don’t have first hand knowledge

Wildcard,

Go Undead shadow preist and get an orb of deception.

Uh yes you can. You're the one who will be in the nasty position of explaining your ninja looting ways. Wait and see.
---
Amen.
---
The best thing you can do is staying the hell away from her when she plays.
---
Nothing turns people off from gaming then someone that is standing behind them and telling them what to do 24/7.
---
Did you ever farm this set. Bwl might be out till you have the complete set...
---
Oh really, what *is* ninja looting then? Because that's the textbook definition. I can't wait to hear your definition.
---
I dont think noble is the correct word. His guides actually has made him a lot of money, there's a reason he prioritizes his guides over his speed run times.
---
But the ping.
---
A PvP specific question - do any classes benefit more than others from having Rank 10/12 gear as opposed to having raid gear?

You made me intensify my research. Thanks 😊

&gt; Nostalgia is the primary appeal, though.
---
Kinda hard to prove something as subjective as that.
---
It's not from 4chan and your really showing your age with this post.
---
There were iLvls, but they did not affect gear the same way they do in retail.
---
A lower iLvl gear might have more stats than a higher iLvl one.
---
Lots of them. Really looking forward to the real thing though where nazis aren't allowed to infest chat channels
---
It's not the same, you're ignorant as shit. One idiot says that on NBC News in the 90s and it gets repeated ad nauseum forever
---
No prob. 
---
Only caveats I’ll add is it also just depends on how dumb your group is (do they break cc? Do crazy pulls?) and how geared your tank is. Also two big factors just from a mana management situation.
---
Still should be ok though
---
No, speed running is about beating the game as fast as you can. You don't have to play in the NFL to play football,  and you don't have to be among the worlds fastest to speed run.
---
gurgthock.ytmnd.com
---
No, they aren't.
---
Why say it all twice? Almost the exact same points, just in different order.
---
&gt; a healer playing decently can really turn the tide.
---
True that. I feel like I consistantly lose when I run RBGs on my warrior, but consistantly win on my resto druid.
---
Having a healer who knows where he is most useful and skillful enough to survive/escape being focused is almost a guaranteed win.
---
This is like saying inhaled steroids for your lungs are the same as shooting up roids into your bare as cheek for gains every day are the same
---
Educate yourself or don't post shit
---
Dood congrats. You win
---
It isn't.
---
Thats an insanely specific connotation you've derived from a button which is only labelled as "need". I've never had to "try", everyone rolls need in pugs when flask recipes drop and they're not on reserve. 
---
That actually isn't what I'm saying, I'm saying BoEs have the same value to everyone in the group. Whether or not someone uses or sells it is up to the individual, but all members should have their shot at rolling.
---
The old way was the norm in 05, but if you haven't checked its been about 14 years; and almost a decade of private server culture has changed that. Have fun getting out rolled and having people laugh at you when you try labelling half the server as ninja looters for using the only fair system.
---
Worst case scenario your just drinking more often. It's not bad considering your saving money on respecs.
---
I can only assume this is a reference to being a baby boomer, in other words, he plays video games like an old person.
---
I've never heard it used this way, but it's funny.
---
Huh?
---
Warrior's also get impale (+20%) and to a lesser extent deep wounds.
---
Deep wounds can fall off tho because its low prio.

Ignite is a different beast all together and you cant really calculate it like this at all.
---
it only snapshots the first 5 crits so if you all crit pyros then you have a god tier ignite rolling, and if you all crit scorches then you have a floppy noodle wriggling around.
---
Streamers = ^^^^^^Small ^^^^^^PP
---
But what are you sacrificing? You can only take one ability. Without summoning a demon, you have no demon to use 'Demonic Sacrifice' on.
---
Yup. Those scaling well with crit is affected way by this though
---
PLEASE DON'T BE DECEIVED
---
Is the noggenfogger form remaining while druid shapeshift confirmed? If so, I know what I'm playing...
---
Depends on the boss. Bosses weren't normalized but had thematic values. A cloth boss would have lower armor than one in plate so to speak. Private servers based all their armor values off of a single low armor boss (Maexxna). Logic dictates that a spider wouldn't have much armor.
---
You are commenting on a thread praising a speedrunner for beating his old splits... Instead you choose to be offended and try to patronize OP. How pathetic.
---
I'd recommend not subscribing to the wild lies of TD. I've been reading your comment history for a couple hours now and, frankly, I'm disgusted. Seek help. There are organizations that will help you clean your mind and allow you to distance yourself from that fanatical and indolent way of thinking.
---
Troll.
---
&gt;Eh, it was in a way. A lot of items would have direct upgrades through each tier. Sure, a handful lasted a few tiers, but you were still replacing a lot of gear.
---
Thats not the point. The point is that it doesnt matter when you reach 60, you will need to go through all the raids (although its faster because of catch up raids). Dou cant ding 60 when naxx is out and go straight to naxx how it is in retail
---
same applies.  
---
you actually use it (now or in the future), need. you want to sell it, greed.  
---
if an items drops in an instance you should have the right to take it. does not matter if its BoE. you helped get it. you deserve it.
---
It can be both.
---
Profiting from an altruistic act doesn't negate it.
---
Overtune from their guess of what armor values are supposed to be, which we know is wrong.
---
Let's say that boss armor ranges from 1 to 10, the boss that private servers based their armor vaules on is a 1 and they cranked it up to 3 because they were too easy. There would still be a huge number of bosses with lots more armor than on private servers
---
Feral druids can only tank when AQ hits. Till then they just heal. Even then its for farm content (very high threat ceilings) in pservers as classic will have different numbers, so it may not even turn out to work.
---
This is nonsense, there is no significant difference between the psychology of Horde or Alliance players.
---
Trust me, therewill be at least 2 raids per faciton worth of people on every server who will smash the leveling content in 2 weeks
---
but i also agree with th eassessment that most people wont be like this. 
---
this is how lots of servers were back in the day. 2 competent raiding guilds and everyone else taking their time to hit 60 and raiding maybe 6 months after launch
---
i rolled on a 'new' server for vanilla in may of 06 i think and i recall our guild hitting MC / ZG in september after releas
---
we all had 60s from previous 'release' date servers and we were experienced we thought, turns out we had to wrangle lots of new players in back then to get used to raiding. i expect all that to happen again for sure.
---
vanilla is 'easy', but nuanced enough to where people should do things right otherwise tons of guils will break up at razergore
---
&gt;Hi, wanted to get some understanding about the standing of an enhancement shaman
---
Sure thing!
---
&gt;at 60 for both PvE and PvP.
---
You'll cry a lot.
---
&gt;Was it an underrated class/spec to play?
---
No. And without some type of synergistic play with a niche setup, I would say its unfortunately extremely overrated.
---
&gt; Was it common for a shaman to go resto in PvE?
---
It was basically mandatory to do more difficult content as enhance was terrible for dps and couldn't heal. They were brought as a gear sponge for extra loot and to fill raid slots when guilds needed more bodies or an extra WF totem.
---
&gt; Is enhancement shaman in PvP deemed as strong? 
---
No, and against a good player that can keep you out of melee range its pretty bad.
---
Its extremely bursty, sometimes very fun, and volatile as all hell. The problem is its not skill based (Rng do be like it do sometimes).
---
You will get frusterated very often when you are only throwing a couple shocks, waiting for WF to proc and getting killed/kited in the process.  If WF doesn't happen, you die.  When it crits -- its almost like an auto win but that's honestly quite rare even with high crit and the extra attack from Storm Strike.
---
You're a spell caster class trying to melee things to death with no inherent base melee skills other than a 20 second cooldown 31 pt talent, on top of having mana problems.
---
Would not recommend enhance to anyone that doesn't play with at least 1 elemental shaman 24/7 for storm strike crit CL wombo combos.
---
&gt;Don't worry.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; so offended 
---
Let's all take about 10 to 15% off here.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#obxVd0bZxgMuc0ut0h
---
I have talked to several older guild mates, and all of them say their ability is degraded to a degree. It doesn't mean their garbage, but slower reaction times are a thing.
---
Plus armor values are wrong. They based it all off of Maexxna, a low armor boss. Some bosses in Classic will have so much more armor than private servers do it'll be silly
---
.5 set wont be available for a very long time. Other than that go for it.
---
Except it's still used in that way. Even you use it that way, you just don't realise it.
---
I'd argue, it was still an easy glance.  T1 vs T2?  They've at least done enough of the content to tell that they would understand what was going on.
---
Now, there are still outliers in vanilla, which is a good thing.  You're still wearing HoJ pretty much all through BWL and only replace it in AQ/Naxx depending how fast the fights are.
---
But there still were item levels, but definitely not the same way it is on vanilla. You didn't have iLvL A and iLvL B where they were both the same item, but one was heroic and other was mythic version. 
---
These truely were different items with each item level boost and readjusted the stats so you needed to do number crunches to actually figure out what were upgrades, what were sidegrades and what were flat out downgrades.
---
I don’t know, seems obvious to me based on the rest of his comment that he is a bit triggered about it. It isn’t abnormal for someone trying to play it off when they feel offended by responding with a snarky comment.
---
There is no point in a 30+ hour run where having slow reaction times would screw your ability to get good times. On top of that, how often does that even come up in questing?
---
Should work no problem.
---
i remember the staff of jordan dropping back in vanilla on a guild 5 man run of SM full clear
---
it was glorious and we all cheered
---
l4d baby!
---
&gt; Jaimes alliance guide
---
Oh yeah that's vanillaguide the addon. It uses TBC or Wrath quest XP values so it gets way ahead at some points.
---
Boomer? Holy fuck, that's some cringe slang shit over there. Those people you mentioned got their leveling speed on private servers while Joanna got it on Vanilla WoW. You know that private servers never were and will be accurate to vanilla? Yet you compare people to official leveling speedrunner world record holder. I would love to see how fast you can go "boomer".
---
&gt; If you don't have sanctuary you take a lot more damage but its still not slow and painful, at worst you would have to single pull and you would still hit lockout in like 40 minutes at most.
---
Yeah, you can do single pulls and make the lockout. But compare that to something like a disc/holy priest... Usually you have 1 sanc spec pally in raid, maybe even guild.
---
Stress test were per invite as the beta but with more invitation, one of them was also NA only - that is far from "open"...
---
The whole thing with these issues that I have is this:
---
They implemented spell batching to make the game feel more like vanilla's latency, effectively changing the game in order to give it a more authentic feel. 
---
Leeway was in vanilla for latency, so that melee could stick to range targets better. 
---
So they changed spell batching for latency, why aren't they doing the same for leeway in the opposite direction?
---
Otherwise, I feel like spell batching can be toned down a little bit, and the melee leeway range can be adjusted down a yard or so.
---
Ive seen it. So have 5000 other ppl. And thats not the only vid like that.
---
Pretty sure it was 6 months.
---
you think you are getting back at streamers when in reality you are fucking over all the participants and the people who genuinely wanted to watch this.
---
I get it though. must be frustrating for you that theres people on this planet who make a living out of your hobby.
---
Interesting - good research fellas. 
---
Im trying my best to understand all this - does crit gained from items (Agi and flat +crit% from items) count as "aura crit"? or is aura crit == Zerker/Talents/Buffs only?
---
I fell for an alt as bait one time and now I suspect every lowbie running around is bait
---
ha, meant Revive. No idea why people upvoted me then lol.

Ofc i CAN kill mobs. But its still so slow and non-effective, that i rather use my shitgeared warrior if i need to kill grind something. I much rather go do DME lashers solo or 2man jump runs.

ATM im dont have to grind anything, bought enough of resistance potions to raid until classic is released and i make gold just by doing raids and few transmutes.

The mail system (12 attachments) is carrying over, B.net integration, auto loot (not area loot) and request next stop button on flightpaths. Aside from those albeit minor changes I don’t think there is anything else.

Alenya and Umbra :)

Is this to the wrong comment? I’m confused

Google Alenya and Umbria’s guide
---
Lots of data made by sniffers was lost during emulation wars and replaced by guesstimates

Lol. No they are not. The biggest one is just moving everything to TBC based server and you have multiple other options as well.

Just make shure you put a rogue of opposite faction on it.

Fuck that noise, if my spouse, kid, and chores took up another 9 hours of my day, while work took 9 hours, leaving 6 for bed.  I'd have been a deadbeat Dad.

Glad I'm done working (yay to military retirement at 39) and my kid is a teenager.
---
RichTurpin you're the man, thx for this vid.  
---
I don't have anything against streamers but some of the more "high profile" ones are so full of themselves that they need to be ganked every now and then.  
---
If you watch their streams they gank other players and laugh about it BUT when they get their asses handed to them by other players the other players are "scrubs" and "recievers of welfare" what a fukn joke.  
---
Well done Sir RichTurpin for doing the community a favour.
---
A "cool community event" that is invite only with the vast majority of the participants being influencers who won't even be playing Classic 6months after release when its popularity starts to die down.
---
APES was trying to be the bad guys here, but the WoW influencers are so childish they managed to make even APES appear likable in comparison.
---
That's my bedroom and where I play and work :)
---
&gt; That wouldn't be possible with separated layers.
---
Of course it would be. Just make sure that all boat and zeppelin transfers go to the same layer. Especially if you only have 1 layer on both continents...
---
I’ll destroy this list with a single word:
---
Layering
---
dw to shamans
---
Your the one who doesn't seem to know what they are talking about, there is going to be thousands of those runs done. The plans will be worth stuff all, by the time you get one someone will be selling the craft for 20g making it worth nothing.
---
Most do
---
I’m talking specially about classic beta here. No private servers being discussed. That’s where Joana is playing. That’s where ahmpy (as one example) is playing. 
---
And thanks for remembering that if you get offended on this sub you gotta make sure to throw in “private servers are inaccurate!” to your post somewhere, right?
---
so between this, the higher parry values on bosses. It's going to be much less likely to see fury tanks sustain the viability they do on pservers(im sure we'll still see top guilds doing it). throw in 16 debuffs at launch and better understanding directly from blizz on how hit works(mostly around human/orc specs or edgeguards) could we be seeing some drastic meta change up?
---
Never said they where right lol
---
Sacrifice your allies demons?
---
Thats hilarious!
---
woof, brother

hh

"means literally nothing"
---
 Unless you pvp, arena especially
---
Was undead in vanilla on my rogue... that orc shun resist is hard to pass up though.
---
Yes, it works. My work laptop is a 620 UHD Graphics, 8 GB ram and i5-8350U. I play both retail and classic beta on it on 1080p (with 75% resolution scaling on retail) on medium/high graphics and it runs perfect.
---
Can push it to max on classic beta but it will lag in large pop areas.
---
*cough* right click reporting
---
Ah the rite of passage - levelling up. Man, I guarantee there will be a bunch of people that cant cut it.
---
Yeah saying all that... it’s 1/4 stun resist. It’s really insane. And it’s passive, that’s not even including blood furry. I do like the undead look a lot. And it fits the lore. However orc is hard to pass up. I’m gonna go back and forth a lot lol
---
Oh wow. This takes me back!
---
Upvoted
---
Close, but not the same. Or do you craft gear with alchemy and enchanting (except for a trinket or two)?
---
Oh I didn't know that, thanks!
---
Sorry I could only read half your comment when suddenly you disappeared on my screen.
---
It may be low but it ain't new.
---
Same here. Tbh I like the female orc stealth animation the most. That helps a bit. From what I heard it’s even 1/3 stun resist. That’s just powerful. On the other hand, there will be a lot less Alliance warlocks than horde warlocks on pvp realms. That’s why I guess orc will be the wiser pick. But UD just looks dope... let’s flip a coin.
---
Rebellious!
---
It depends a lot on how geared your tank is. If you tank is in purples yes you could do dungeons naked probably without too much trouble. If your tank is in greens than be prepared to be healing a lot.
---
r/lostredditors
---
not new, it's been around for over a year
---
Lmao is this 4real
---
Female orcs do look awesome In gear also. That’s a good pick for sure, large male orc shoulders are cool but if i remember correctly there was also an issue with how they looked. I agree with a coin flip! I have my nostalgia on my old undead rogue tho so it’s gonna be hard! I pvped also and got rank 13. The warlord set was so clean on undead
---
If you do meth, you don't need to sleep. If you don't sleep, you don't need to accountshare.

Actually I am playing retail at the moment, quite enjoy it. :)
---
It wasn't there when I tried yesterday. EU here, so maybe this is still US only. And yes, I resubbed recently.
---
PvP is PvP no matter the circumstances.
---
Remember that video of a realm having a memorial event for someone who died and alliance shows up and kills everyone?
---
Or 2-3 guilds camping MC entrances around raid hours.
---
This is why WoW can be so amazing. I love it.
---
This just shows how spoiled streamers in modern gaming are. Luckily streaming wasn't a thing back in vanilla. But today, I look at them as more PvP content. In classic you can do PvP and go watching them live while busting some tears.
---
If they can't handle this on the beta, they  will have trouble on the live servers. Their only option is to pick PvE.
---
Could you be a bit more specific? I've played quite a bit of hunter and these builds play literally the same, you keep range, you use a core of 4-5 shots to keep them at distance and whittle them down. The only major difference is how much damage your pet puts out vs. how much damage you put out, and that you forfeit Scatter Shot for Intimidation and Bestial Wrath, so you have fewer CC options. 
---
There are more builds for PvP btw, there are deep survival specs, the CC focussed builds that include both Intimidation and Scatter, but at the end of the day, you're a hunter - you keep your distance and shoot fools. Not much of a playstyle difference that I can see, please enlighten me.
---
Have you already found a job? I guess your life suffered a lot of it.
---
Male Orc is a no go for me. Rogue imo is sneaky and not a large 1x1m sized box. Hmmpf...
---
Doesn't it add up to the same in the end?
---
Say you have 50% crit chance. 20% from talents, 20% from gear and 10% from buffs.
---
On private servers that would be reduced by a flat 3% which is 48.5%.
---
Then, on Blizzard the 3% is taken from each source:
---
Talents: 19.4%
---
Gear: 19.4%
---
Buffs: 9.7%
---
Total: 19.4+19.4+9.7 = 48.5
---
... So it's the same crit chance.
---
What am I not seeing here?
---
40 arms/fury.
---
Just let her discover the game and just tag a long to babysit in case shit gets too tough. Me and my partner had loads of fun just lett her muddle through finding quests/exploring with me just tagging along helping her fight mobs and levelling together.
---
Definitely don't try to rush the game. It's her first time in the world. Make sure she gets to explore it at her own pace.
---
Kurzu's jungle camp is rightful horde clay. Loved ganking there because it'd bring 60s to lead groups of alliance into the tunnels.
---
Version 3 and pick dwarf.
---
Human is only the better choice, if you plan on going pve raid ret. For everything else, dwarf is better, because stoneform is great and human only has the weapon skill, which is essential in raids, but barely does anything anywhere else.
---
Version 1 is a heavy tanking build, it's most suited for tnaking and has detriments for healing. This doesn't work too well for pve healing and pvp.
---
Version 2. Well, you want a holy reckoning build and this build doesn't have reckoning. This is a pure pve build. Holy shock is not great and if you were to go pure pve healing, you'd go 30/21/0 to pick blessing of sanctuary.
---
Version 3 is what you want. It is a true hybrid build, that allows oyu to tnak 5 mans decently, be a reck bomber in pvp and heal well in pve and pvp. I'd do some minor adjustments though. Take away the point in imp rightousness, it's a very bad talent and one point will do nothing. Secondly I'd also pick up kings for the versatility. Many players in pvp will love it, when you bring kings and it's generally am ore important buff than Sanc.
---
Reckoning is fine. Reckoning worked in vanilla, where the /sit trick didn't work as well.
---
If it ain't broke don't fix it. You are clearly an unintelligent person, it's not shit talk at this point.
---
Considering half of the clips were made during a testing stage for the car with a different set of wheels, and people driving said car during the remaining 20 days without the wheels falling off:
---
Sure.
---
The layering CD prevents you from layering again after you just layered (duh). That wouldn't solve much on its own, but this CD is also triggered by gaining XP, harvesting nodes and some more things (don't think it was extensively tested what works and what doesn't). That means you can't layer to farm mobs/nodes/... and the abuse potential drops dramatically.
---
Why a dude has a girl name as a nick? My ex girlfriend was named Joana. BRUH.
---
Also, speed leveling in mmo's is blah. All leveling will stop at lvl 60, so there is nowhere to run in truth.
---
makes sense if you're left-handed. the righties who do it are just madmen
---
You don´t roll need with the sole purpose to make gold. I think the definition of need and greed breaks apart when talking about recipes.
---
Elemental is the way to go here. For more pve weigh heavier into fire, pvp use something like this.
---

---
Screw frost arcane meh..
---
How do you get 6 classes out to 4,66? If they're PvP players, they are either shadow or healing priests, I'll give you that. But any non-elemental shaman doesn't exist in PvP. So 5,5 classes out of 8 (not counting your own, obviously.) have favourable matchups into you. 
---
Compare that to magi, who have favourable matchups against everything except SL warlocks and very well-geared feral druids, or spriests who have favourable matchups into everything but magi.
---
It's ok for initial threat if things are spread out or just too many to tab target, but shouldn't be something you use for every pull. For 3 targets I wouldn't bother. Hit all 3 with sunder and hit skull with your revenges while mixing in 2-3 sunders on everything.
---
Are you sure? Gouge is considered an incapacitation effect while grenades behave like gouge, however are considered a stun by the game.
---
I belive you can only resist grenades.
---
Okay thanks. I’ll give that a go for my next run :)
---
Guys, Joana obviously loves doing this and sharing his guides with everyone for free! And the majority of these replies are negative bc someone else can do it faster.
---
The title says 2h20m faster than his best, not the world record.
---
Gratz Joana, keep doing you and thanks for the hard work you’ve put into the guides that many of us have used for years and will continue to use for years to come.
---
Did you post to the wrong comment? I don't get what that has to do with my comment.
---
Aaand the real question is, why do you falsely state, that the internet wasn't invented till 2006?
---
Resisting a grenade and a metric shitton of other stun effects could indirectly by considered a health boost, because you dont sit in a 6 second HoJ eating them enemy attacks. You are out there either retreating or ending the menace.
---
Priests Fear/charm
---
Warlocks Fear/charm
---
Warriors Fear
---
Shadowpriests Stun
---
Rogues Stun
---
Warriors Stun
---
Hunters Stun
---
Druids Stun
---
Paladins Stun
---
Trinkets/Items can stun as well
---
Orc and undead are both good pvp racials. You will probably get stun more than you get feared (depending on the situation)  But WOTF is better like 1v1 ganking if the target you are facing fears. Since you can pre-pop it to become fear/charm/sleep immune. Having a 30% chance to straight up not get hit by every stun is pretty nice tho
---
I don't think this is a good choice. Holy shock is not very good and you are missing guardians favor. Also SoC and no crit chance talent but imp. might is pretty baffling. 
---
You can use a build like this for pve healing and farming solo, but it's not great for pvp
---
Stance swap clears rage you can talent to retain a little but it still drops most of it.
---
Yeah, you need to be on your toes and have the enslave macroed as it will break as well. But it is doable and can be fun (not just in winterspring). It is just framing that wont allow you to watch netflix at the same time :D
---
sit in D stance and pool rage more, shouldnt be pulling a new pack below with less than 25 rage.
---
little to no reason to charge just pull with your gun, its safer and beter overall.
---
when a mob is about to die and your healer still has mana pull the next mob and keep the train going.
---
use blood rage to keep yourself in combat to stop rage decay when your healer needs to drink.
---
It sounds like this is an additional nerf against the total crit gained from Auras and Buffs. So against a boss level creature, the first 3% of crit from buffs is negated. Stacked with feral druid with Leader of the Pack, a berserker stance warrior should see their first extra 3%, no?
---
I’ll usually only swap stances ( with the talent) if my rage is low enough to warrant it or if not switching will cause a wipe
---
You need to hit them with a sunder immediately if you don’t want to get pulled off of. Battle shout and demo do nearly nothing in comparison. After first sunder you can demo shout to get on threat table for secondary adds then do revenge/sunder/shield block as needed. After 1/2 primary target threat abilities (sunder/revenge/interrupt with bash) you can sunder the secondary target to keep heals from pulling off you
---
Priest.

Hating on this guy but praising the Ooga gang? Ok.

Either is fairly easy but with shaman you might not get the ele-specific items earlier, and youll likely have more or at best equal number of shamans to priests in raids. So priest should be a bit easier, but honestly pvp gearing is not bad for both.
---
I might, but, would it differ a lot if i picked paladin? Talking in class-demand and spot reservation.

Don't spoil it!

---
Show her that the Auction House is like eBay for gear. I’ve seen that appeal to non-gamers and draw them into the rest of the game
---
Hard to say for sure without seeing you tank. Sunder and revenge do like 90% of the work. If you are engineering you can throw for a bit of threat on everything. Thorns/fire shield make you sticky. It definitely helps for your party to focus fire, so make a skull. If your weapon is out of date, that can cause problems too.
---
I believe that is a mythe.
---
50 ping on a decent connection, it's really low compared to what it was in 2006
---
I'm the same boat really, I could AT MOST do 10 hours a week but probably closer to 5. 
---
I've booked in 5 days of nolife at launch which I'm aiming for maybe 10-12 hours a day. And with a bit of luck maybe another 3-5 days a month after which should take a big chunk out of the first 60 grind. 
---
Probably not gonna follow a guide, but I will really be focussing on leveling during the nolifes.
---
Yes it is confirmed. Is was patched in by 1.12.1 but deviate delight wasnt idk why.
---
They won’t use old names, because it might make confusions
---
I would focus sunder before the shouts to get threat up higher first if you keep getting hit you will get more rage to cast the other two.
---
i didn’t even play classic. i just want a good mmo to play
---
Priests are just all around a better healer. Arguably the paladin does better in pvp since they're harder to kill. That's about their only pro.
---
I've got 18.5 days /played in the beta, and I'm still having a blast.
---
Yesterday, on my lowbie druid, I flipped for 7 consecutive jumps. How is that not OP?!
---
Yes
---
S tier:  Warrior Hunter Rogue
---
Good to great itemization, and these classes scale well with base stats
---
A tier:  Feral Shadow, Fire, Frost, Warlock
---
Good, maybe a bit low on int for heavy utility in pvp, Feral doesnt scale as well as other melee
---
B tier:  Disc/Holy Priest
---
Priest set has some regen so it is ok, but you would rather all the spell power be healing
---
C tier:  Elemental/Enhancement Rpaladin
---
Shaman set is weird, half is made for enhance and half for elemental.  Paladin set is half way between caster stats and str.  Ret ideally needs to build more like a warrior with just a bit less stam for some int.  That being said there really isn't set gear for these specs outside of pvp, so they are often still BIS pieces prior to AQ.  
---
F tier:  Rdruid, H paladin, R shaman
---
Sets have no regen low int, and spell power instead of healing.  Typically these classes would only wear 2 pieces for the high stam and then use pve gear.
---
Still in a duo or group PvP scenario in which magic abilities like HoJ will hopefully be dispelled build in extra range is just soooo crucial. 
---
Especially against pserver players who are very comfortable skirting around a warriors range. With just another 2yards build into tauren you will hit that clothie from further away.
---
From what I also heard non direct target abilities like frostnova or cone of cold do not hit tauren from further away than other classes.
---
However I havent been able to check that claim.
---
Still 2yards in a group PvP situation will be marvelous against everything that does not want to be in a warrior's range aka everything.
---
Why would that ruin things? That's insane.
---
Not to just one mob, but to 5!
---
Ultimate bad manners move
---
Prot paladin has a lot of problems.  One of which is that it is a spec that is at war with itself.  To shine it needs to take damage and be crit, but every piece of gear you get will ideally reduce the chances of ther happening, with through avoidance or +defense.  
---
I think reck is best while leveling and you expect to somewhat frequently be tanking mobs higher level then you, but in an ideal prot build at 60 you would not have it, as your goal would be to crit immune or close to it.
---
Isn´t this just the increased defense of the +3mob that reduces your crit?
---
It will work fine. I have run the beta on a 3rd gen i5 and hd4000 and it runs perfectly.
---
holy crapperoni CritLine, easily 10+ years i've heard that
---
Healers in pvp have different roles. In the alliance (on the basis that you consider paladins):
---
- paladin: defensive dispelling (nr1 prio), pushing up with warriots when needed to provide freedom, bubble if overextended, also boping the right targats at the right time, hojing rogues trying to snipe your backlane, spam heals, avoiding enemy casters
---
- priest: offensive dispelling (nr1 prio), defensive dispelling, shields/renews, direct spam heals if needed, avoiding enemy melees
---
- druid: flag carrying if in wsg, decursing and abolish poision, prehotting warriors pushing in, saving ppl with ns, controlling people with roots/charge/bash
---
I got ganked on pserver by 3 rogue gnomes named shoulda coulda and woulda lmao
---
Technically ferals get double combo points from crits as well, but you know...
---
Hello Pingaan! Thank you very much for this answer! Here are my answer : )
---
1) the hit cap for human ret using mace or sword is 6% (it is indeed a 3% hit increase). You’ll find the link for the calculation here. https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss . So it means that with the precision talent, paladin only needs 3% hit.
---
2) I understand your logic regarding that, but as it is a list of BIS, it should reflect what is bis and what is not, don’t you think ? To be fully honest, my guild will be using your sheet to his loot system, and i would like it to be as accurate as possible, especially for ret ;) Could it be possible to do the edit ?
---
3) From what we found in our discord paladin, the maelstorm card do not scale with spell power, and wyrmtalak as a proc rate that is terrible.
---
Many thanks for your answer, time and dedication !
---
Thankfully that won't happen much at all and you prolly wont even notice layering is there =)
---
God I fucking hated Silithis. 
---
Mobs hit hard, its depressingly sandy, and I don't recall most of the quests being at all interesting.
---
Buying a decent MMO mouse.
---
No way, if you found this funny you are clearly jealous of streamers according to complainers in this thread.
---
Really, though, come on. A bunch of people whining and asking blizzard to ban people for pvping on a pvp server is pretty sad. And I usually don't even care about streamers.
---
Of the people that say they are gonna go main druid tank in raids on places like this subreddit expect ballpark 70-95% of them to fail and either primarily heal or reroll.  
---
With your time constraints the chances would be even higher, I would only bet on it working for you if you told me you had experience with it in vanilla or on a private server, or if you had a committed guild that OKd you playing meme status specs.  
---
This is coming from someone that likes feral druids as offtanks, we had a very good one in vanilla.  Many guilds would auto reject them.
---
1. Play Horde. The character races are more exciting and immersive if she enjoys fantasy already. Like it or not, some of the alliance races are kinda-boring for some women.
---
You will be fine. Prob  have to lower some settings, maybe play a slightly lower resolution.
---
I'm in the same boat.
---
The games I currently play include Fallout 2 and Arcanum. Both are even older than Vanilla WoW.
---
Uh, yeah you kinda do. Otherwise you're comparing it to nothing but your own 15 years old memories and that's a source I definitely won't take seriously.
---
Wrong answer.

nipmips story is so obviously fake but yet so funny.
---
Remember this when you're grinding scorpid poison.
---
Sure, just farm rank 11. It's not like rank 11 is easy to get. Not having an epic mount will make it even harder. You have to consistently rank in the top 20% for several weeks to get rank 11.
---
Warrior is totally possible to solo stuff on.  It is perhaps the worst at taking on more then it can chew.  You just need to make sure to not waste quests on warrior so you are as frequently as is possible doing green/yellow quests.  Red/orange quests that other classes can squeeze in murder warriors.
---
Tanking at low levels can be incredibly hard if people don't understand how threat works. Its not something people usually learn that early in levels. But something to think about is marking targets every pull and click off any priest shields. Your not generating much rage with absorb shields on.
---
It is very low pop, which is its sole redeeming factor.
---
Maybe it's not the raiding part but the social part that matters to them.
---
In a pug you know maybe 1-5 others hopefully.
---
In a set guild of people you will get to know plenty more and you will make friends.
---
Some people prefer going to the local park and play football in a pick up game with strangers, others like to join the sports club and play with the other 10 ten in a premade group.
---
Both are totally legit and neither the pick up footballers nor the sport's club ones have a right to look down upon the others preferred mode of playing.
---
Leveling from 1 -10 is basically the same thing in both thematically. A newbie won't be able to tell the difference except for that retail all in is a much better learning experience in early levels. It's now designed to get you immersed immediately so you sub up from the free trial.
---
Keep up the good work Josh!
---
Top notch
---
This is just downright sad. 
---
Think about what you're doing. You're wasting your time in classic trying to get negative reactions out of people you don't even know, who don't even care about you. Just let that sink in honestly.
---
I think going to STV a bit after it's optimal is probably the best approach (when you can still get full xp from the early Beast hunts). Around 36 or 37 maybe? At that point you at least stand a chance in the top half of the zone and can grind out those beasties/trolls ([H])
---
Bind a well used ability like shadowbolt or frostbolt to your mousewheel. Makes it much smoother to dps imo.
---
There are only 180 quests for thunder bluff total and 100 rep average is pretty high.
---
The only thing I remember about Azshara is grinding felcloth.
---
same for me
---
Are you protection speced? If so, that's the problem, protection spec in 5 mans = rage starvation. Respect arms/fury.  Secondly if you're gear is too good for the level, you won't get enough rage from taking damage.  Tank with DW fury/2H arms if that's the case just for the extra rage gen.
---
Finally, learn to chain pull. When I tanked in classic I typically pulled the next group while the last mob was still beating on me with my rage bar at about 50%.  If you time it right the healer should have enough time to sit and drink before you need a heal and the DPS will be to busy killing the last mob to try and yank aggro.  Sometimes I'd hamstring the last mob before I moved off to get the next group.
---
Yeah I found that out very early in my first dm run I did. I think if you’re not taking damage directly you’re not generating rage from being hit. 
---
I think in my classic runs I’ll need to shiw more authority. Problem is healers will just heal the stupid who will attack too early.
---
But nobody gives a shit about them while they are a deciding factor in retail
---
It's a Lot better if you have competent people who can peel for you.  I ran a warrior and my ex gf ran a priest, and it worked amazingly well.  If she got jumped by a rogue, I would immediately drop what I was doing to go fuck his day up. Your damage dealers have to know that when you die, the fun stops, at least until respawn.
---
dude i am just a WoW surgeon, i do not understand basic maths; if it is red or green i equip it
---
Oh my gosh Enhancement, Ret, and Boomkin got crushed!
---
It could actually be more than that. They wouldn't give us a number on how much is negated, we only know for certain that 3% is negated.
---
Couldn't prot warriors just abuse overpower?
---
I don't even take it as an insult as it usually comes from 16 year olds.
---
would be pretty funny to see a tauren warrior kiting another warrior
---
To me, this is the best zone ever. I can hear it and feel it by just looking at this picture. Leveling in the Barrens together with my friends again, after so many years is what I am most excited for.
---
I'm more shocked about how you can fall and lose damage twice in a row tbh.
---
This isn't even me, I just thought it was funny.
---
This is a properly beta tested post. QUALITY!
---
I don't actually I'm very careful in my use of language but your probably just generalizing so it's an easy mistake to make.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I checked about DX12 and apparently it is available (sort of?) for Win7

You get the opener, grats. Dwarves can vanish with stoneform or stoneform your blind to reset the fight. The dwarf just needs to keep up bleeds and it’s gg

I dont like private servers but this title is horrible and pointless.

Holy fucking shit

---
Barely seen these comments you talk about, I have seen 10x as many threads complaining about it though
---
Young man! Pick yourself off the ground!
---
It's funny because the people they're talking about are usually Gen X.
---
Depends on the boss.
---
I can imagine they do that on bosses like Ony who hit like a wet noodle.  
---
On others it might become increasingly difficult, because you might waste a good 40rage by stance dancing if you stance change after a bosses attack.
---
In dungeons I use(d) overpower all the time, especially in lowbie dungeons in which you often have a very slow 1hander like Outlaw Sabre, Thrash Blade, Hand of Antu'sul etc. and are generally rage starved.
---
if u try to explore and move to some locations close to that route + some delivery quests u can level NE to 5.5-5.8 lvl in an hour or so. so u can tp back to Dolanaar n start questing there. was useful route to get rid of starting location bottleneck plus u save a lot of time for the future cuz u got FPs, aint sure its gonna be necessary at release since we got layering
---
If you havent picked up an MMO yet, why the hell are you choosing the nostalgia train that is classic?
---
This game is for people that have played MMO's.
---
You can come in blind, thats fine.
---
But to get a little seniority pressed on you is expected.
---
Obviously, there will be guilds out there that are purely for learning players.
---
But, for your first MMO ever is a brought back to life version of an established MMO, then im not sure.
---
I know this sub hates streamers and advertising, but I spent my whole night making this and a bunch if other memes I've been dump on y'all. If you're looking for a stream to watch once classic drops, it should be a a lot of fun: twitch.tv/kidcolfax
---
/plug
---
Not quite, what some of these meme specs do bring is a lot of utility. The innervate from a feral alone is more than 50% of a healer's mana. It's also one more battle ress and if we desperately need a healer then he can just equip a dress and start healing instead. 
---
Retris are hard to justify. They require an insane amount of consumables and gear to even stay anywhere close to relevant. If Nightfall works as it does on private servers then they are really good at keeping it up on the boss. They also have some utility like AoE tanking and I guess an emergency lay on hands. I'll take a ret to raid mostly because they are always fun people. I don't know why but all the rets I've ever met are super nice and cool people. These are the people who can keep a raid going when you're wiping on trash and everyone plays badly.
---
A lot of them can actually, yes. All it needs is a single proc while the tank is repositioning, which happens plenty of times, and a melee is gonna get whacked in the face. Not speccing into Frostbite was raiding 101 back in the days. Even if a melee didn't die, the healers would panic at the sudden health drop, and the melee would rage. Sorry but if you're planning on going for a PvE/PvP hybrid build then don't expect to be **allowed** to run Frostbite.
---
Imagine how bad it can be ingame. When a new tank doesnt know about tanking and is just gonna be yelled at and eventually just kicked out of the group. Lots of elitists around. Thats the side effect of running private servers over years.
---
retail solution to a classic problem=dumb AF
---
Dwarves are badass. You can stoneform vanish to reset the fight against rogues, hunters, warriors.
---
The salt was hilarious.
---
Don't streamers say they want the vanilla experience ?
---
Well, being ganked is part of that, enjoy.
---
Anything to control my threat as a warlock. Feint, soulshatter, cower etc. Any of those.
---
I wen to Ahmpy’s twitch and asked him how he was so much faster and he straight up said because he was using XP exploits and that Joana was “old fashioned”
---
yeah implemented the 3,5sec global wf cooldown. pretbc patch on 60 was fun as fuck. finally shaman's where toping mc/bwl dps for 4ids haha
---
Dude, this was common knowledge since early vanilla.
---
We all knew moonkin was going to be like this.
---
Give me charge on my rogue
---
Or maybe rejuv...
---
Why should we? If you are a new player I am not sure if Classic is the first place you should be at to ne honest
---
The gods have spoken, so obey he must!
---
barrens pros: no pvp, lots of quests
---
Cons: lots LOTS of walking
---
I'm not really a guy who watches streams, but this was a great job and spot on.
---
fairly sure spiders/crocs/crabs have no special ability at all, some have 1 extra and some have 2 extra (like cat with dash/prowl or windserpent with breath/dive)
---
Negative. Weapon skill removes most of these penalties.
---
I dont follow, why would windows 10 be free?
---
exactly. the same kids who used the word "squeaker"
---
Why do I want this more than I actually want Classic?
---
If you're playing ally, the furbolg transformation rod from the ashenvale quest works too :)
---
Define a lot. I'm excited and never played vanilla (started in wotlk) but I think most people are vanilla vets.
---
Yeah with tea and zg trinket good luck surviving the Cheapshot against daggers.
---
I don't really agree with the DKP problems especially for phase 1. You aren't going to need to optimize loot to clear. DKP will also help you keep attendance up. 
---
If your dead set on this EP system I'll flush out a few obviously flaws. 
---
1. There will be some resentment from people that don't have as much free time to both raid and dungeon to "earn" EP.
---
2. There will definitely be abuse from friends giving EP to each other. 
---
3. Healers and tanks will probably have a distinct advantage.
---
4. This system is literally how retail WoW structures its reward system and that leaves a bad taste for me personally, possibly others.
---
Well, because.. Look at my horse, my horse is amazing!
---
Thanks mate, will do!

Priest Mind Control is Charm
---
Just like everyone said, let her enjoy the journey. Don't overwhelm her with informations but encourage her to ask any questions. Be her support, not the opposite. Let her pick the faction/race/class etc.  
---
Plus i would encourage her to always stay hydrated when playing Wow, and bring her a bottle of water everytime she plays. But the smart trick is here :  
---
Just put a light dose of tobacco or ecstasy on the water. Everytime. At start it won't have any effect, but soon or later the addiction will kick in. So she will indirectly associate playing wow with calming the need.  
---
Then if she plays alone, no ecstasy. The need will only be complete if you play together. **She will both be addict to Wow and to you. Win-win**
---
(Sorry for the monkey english)
---
you can buy win 10 cheap and just add a 30 dollar ssd and your PC will feel like brand new.
---
There is a big difference between having a full t5 geared group and walking into said raid /farming it to get said loot with t3/t4.
---
Ive played on private servers for like 1.5years and there are a lot of people like that. 
---
But i dont think most new players will have to deal with that because they will out level newer players anyway. And around the time newer players reach lvl 50-60 they should have some idea about how to tank and what not.
---
no, its a short root, see here:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spell=27685
---
The crit values you listed are so called "auras" (including % crit from gear) per Bluepost definition. They are added up and then the magic modifier is reducing this crit value. On top of that your base crit will get the 3% penalty for mobs +3 levels. 
---
So lets say a lvl 60 warrior has 10% base crit (naked from his base agility) and another 10% crit from gear or buffs and talents.
---
If he fights a mob 3 lvl higher his base crit will be reduced by 3% leaving him at 7% base crit. Furthermore the 10% crit from the auras will get reduced by an unknown amout.
---
item level was exactly how the stat budget for items was calculated in vanilla, and the formula for it was reverse engineered to a degree (it wasn't the precise formula the game used since it didn't match all items perfectly, but that's not the point here). An item of item level L can be used by a player of level L - 5, and the stats present on the item depend on L and the item rarity. (See e.g. http://wow.allakhazam.com/wiki/Itemization_Formulas_(WoW) for a 2008 article on the subject, which is obviously TBC era, but this stuff was known about back in vanilla because I remember reading about it back in vanilla).
---
Didn't know that about DKs. Shame it lost relevance.
---
I fully agree btw. Increasing width of talent trees instead of depth would be more interesting in the long run. Adding more depth each expansion naturally leads to a talent system like in cata and beyond. Now each spec is pretty much a unique class. Makes it less coherent to me
---
Average joe will be 60 like 5-6 months after release.

that ''Nope'' is a clear : not showing our hands for you filthy criminal private servers - statement
---
I saw a lot of pre bis list that only put it on P2 - it means that the receipt had maybe been implemented only in P2. Thoughts?
---
Isn't one of the rules here something like don't post a question you can easily google? I don't see why we need to coddle people for being lazy. I get being nice to new people but the lazy? No thanks.
---
I use "I" for character sheet since I associate that with inventory
---
Oh ok I gotcha.  I'll check that out thx.  Honestly my pc still runs like the day I got it mostly but I only use it for YouTube or old games.
---
And it takes under 15min from Dun Morogh to Northshire Abby for all you gnomes and dwarfs out there.
---
So what?
---
Imagine that, a player who doesn't know how to do the thing he's supposed to do and therefore wasting time and frustrating (at least) four other people - getting yelled at and kicked out of the group for not doing what he's supposed to do.

Just select "I don't have a key" at install. It never pesters you like 7 and 8 did. MS don't care, they make piss all from home users, the money is entirely in business licenses, and 10 fully updates itself because MS came to the realisation that letting all users have updates makes the world more secure in general.

Also as 7 user you are probably still entitled to a free upgrade if you clicked even once on the option a few years back, it should still be valid.
---
To all who say "why start with Classic when you are new to mmo's?"
---
I will be playing classic and have almost no mmo experience. I am excited solely for classic because the game is a classic, duh! I have heard so many good things about it and it looks way more dope and rpg-ish than retail or other modern mmos that are totally over the top.
---
I am willing to learn the game and put effort into playing my role correctly but every some 'elite' players really need to chill out. You were new to WoW at one point aswell, why not allow other people to experience the awesomeness of WoW like you did in the past by helping and being friendly rather than getting immediately triggered over small things.
---
I have played 1 month of retail as prep and got shouted at multiple times by groupmembers, even harassed using whispers. I got a thick skin as I play fighting games and am used to trash talk but damn. When I am oom because I don't have optimal heirloom gear and the tank just pulls more mobs, I wouldn't consider it my fault when I type 'wait, no mana' in the chat. 
---
It is a game afterall and should be fun, flipping over some beginner faults is not fun for you and the other player. Just my two cents on the topic :)
---
Nailed it man.
---
Tip your mages don’t forget
---
wyvern sting should also be under sleep category, along with druid hibernate.
---
What an entitled opinion. Honestly the game is so much more fun to play with casuals/new people asking questions and showing them stuff instead with tryhards who instantly throw a tantrum when you don't know the way to a dungeon.
---
Yeah, I'm really not seeing this what OP is writing:
---
&gt;Been seeing a lot of dickery, assholery, and general shittery in the comments lately directed at new players for asking simple questions.
---
I'm actually seeing people being very helpful. Yes, sometimes people say "You could have googled this", but that's not what OP is writing. Seems like a lame attempt at virtue-signalling.
---
Two builds that come to mind are these:
---
Combat swords is always good. Not as strong vs casters, not as bursty obviously but high damage and good vs higher armor targets.
---
31/12/8 seal fate / dagger has high burst and damage output in general 
---
IMO combat daggers is more of a PvE build and prep builds are PvP oriented. Combat swords / seal fate daggers are a bit more in the middle
---
Or they are embarassed to show their math operations. :)
---
I've been considering going on a US server as a EU player. Mostly because I think raid times will be better for me. I still haven't decided though. It'll be a random pvp server with a cool name either way.
---
Jebaited the shit out of a certain streamer tonight like this
---
Dude I have all of the ytmnd sound tracks from when I played classic back in the day. I have been saving them for the relaunch. I can't taint my epic music with private serves bleh
---
Feral Charge isn't a stun but it is a root, interrupt and gap closer all in one.
---
I have not been fortunate enough to particpate in the Beta testing however I believe I might be able to point out a thing or two. 
---
If the spell-batching and leeway is truly as bad as people make it sound like then by all means I am against it, however I am from the middle-east and among many other players who play from there we never had anything lower than 200-150ms latency in WoW. I understand that most people from the EU on the EU servers probably have 20-80ms and thus how it could be problematic.
---
Classic WoW gameplay fluidity was never as fluid as current WoW and thats given. It was part of the character of the game as it was the core most basic systems with everything from what current WoW provided is stirpped from it. I am NOT from the nochanges fanatics however I feel like all that people are doing is literally comparing private servers and current modern WoW to the Classic version which we all know is just not right.
---
At the end of it, I want the game to be as fluid and as smooth as possible without any of the spoken about lame mechanics of leeway and spell-batching and considering how well the current Classic team have been doing things, I do have alot of faith in them with that they will indeed make the best decisions for the game.

---
Hunter or Warlock then.
---
The word "meme" was coined by Dawkins and it has the same meaning as it did back then.
---
Some of the responses here shows that OP clearly has a point. Classic has an elitist problem. It's not gonna ruin the game, but it certainly gonna get unpleasant for some new people.
---
So basically they'll be even worse than before
---
As it stands currently tauren look way better than they did on PS. They have 9.66 yd attack range, a stun and 5% more total health. Orc stun resist is still insane and the weapon skill is probably too good to pass up for PvE DPS, but that attack range in PvP is immense.
---
Undead to cannibalize people after you gank them.
---
Exactly this.  
---
And if you say something about that , you are an asshole or something like that.
---
Not as brutal as the Discord tests!
---
&gt; Wouldnt fury tanks among topnotch guilds be even more prevelant, because the increased parry chance by bosses also gimps prot DPS? 
---
There is only one reason for Fury tanks to exists : superior threat. However, that superior threat comes at the cost of survivability. To keep the Fury tanks alive during a boss fight, healers will use a lot more mana, compared to keeping a Prot tank alive.
---
Hence, there must be a balance between tanks threat and mana pool required. If the boss dies before tank healers run out of mana, it's all good.
---
On private servers, Fury tanks are facing bosses with 5.6% parry chance, compared to Classic bosses with 14% parry. The private servers offer Fury tanks an advantage on threat AND survivability (less parry-hasted hit from bosses).
---
You are right, the Prot tanks will also lose threat against a 14% parry boss, but less than Fury or Druid tanks, because Prot Warriors have a much higher parry chance than Fury and Druids, hence, the Prot Warrior will counter-parry more hits from the bosses that have a higher parry-haste on Classic, losing less threat.
---
So, on one hand, Fury Warriors and Druids (I am adding druids because they are also threat tanks) that have less parry (Fury tanks) or ZERO parry (Druid tanks) will lose a bigger threat percentage in Classic vs private servers, compared to Prot Warriors.
---
On the other hand, due to parry-haste in Classic being 250% higher (5.6% vs 14%) than private servers, Fury tanks and Druid tanks will be much more exposed to incoming spike damage, Fury tanks having no counter ( because nobody can predict a spike and equip a shield to diminish the damage), while Druids have the passive Armor and HP pool to survive such a spike.
---
Add the loss on crit, and Fury and Druid tanks lose more threat, while Prot Warriors will not lose as much, because Prot tank threat is like 80% coming from added threat to skills, not DPS, while Fury tanks are building most threat through DPS and Druid tanks almost 50-50 through DPS and added threat to skills.
---
In Classic, with 14% parry on bosses, and less crit chance, the threat will be NORMALIZED among Fury, Druid and Prot tanks.
---
The difference in tanks threat will much lower in Classic compared to private servers. All tanks will lose threat, but Prot Warrior will be the less affected ones.
---
However, the Prot tanks will RETAIN their survivability.
---
In Classic, all raid boss fight will last LONGER, because of threat loss, hence, raid DPS loss. How much longer? I have no idea, because we STILL don't know how resistances are working on private servers, but only with the loss of crit across tanks and DPS, and 250% more parry for Classic raid bosses, I'd say the fights will last significantly longer.
---
That opens up two MAJOR issues, especially for Fury tanks (and to a lesser extent to Druid tanks) : damage spikes and healers mana pool.
---
I frankly don't see Fury Warriors tanking raid during progression. Their gear and healers mana won't be enough to keep them alive, even if they survive damage spikes. Later on, when a guild is BWL geared, yeah, they can use Fury tanks in MC, for shorter runs, since healers will be able to keep them up.
---
Druids have it slightly better, but they will suffer the same problems, during longer fights : damage spikes and mana issues for healers.
---
In the end, Classic fights will last longer, and to remove the risk of having the tank 2-shotted, all progression guild will use Prot Warriors as main tanks.
---
People that play on private servers have this strange idea that Fury and Druid tanks will still be fine in Classic. For farming status raids, sure, Fury and Druid tanks will be more than fine.
---
But for progression?
---
Well, clearly they haven't played Vanilla, because those who did, have seen the fate of Fury and Druid tanks trying to MT a boss.
---
Classic will put a HARD STOP on Fury tanking, and a SOFT STOP on Druid tanking.
---
It will be hard for non-Vanilla players to accept the reality : the optimal raid tank in Vanilla was the Protection Warrior.
---
And it will be the same in Classic.
---
For a reason that I kept repeating on this sun since like forever : the game was DESIGNED for Prot Warriors as Main Tank raids.
---
To against this design, it's stupid, at best, and insane, at worst.
---
We all know that slight changes to Classic will have a major impact on the game. Why can't we agree that 250% less parry on private servers is a MAJOR change, hence, have a HUGE impact on the game, AKA : Fury and Druid tanks.
---
Classic will be a sad wake up call for lots of players that never played Vanilla in 2005-2006.
---
Well, for starters I am different.
---
I've always played male characters. Nope, won't make that mistake again.
---
Back in BC a girl in my guild seemed to have hidden, uncounscious priviledges provided to her. Everybody was super nice to her on ventrillo, talking about hiking 'n shit.
---
But whenever I talked for 5 minutes about how I had fun in a trip to France, all I got was a shitty "ah, that's great man, do you have any elixir of major agility?".
---
I said Yes and afterwards we went to gruuls lair and I didnt say a fucking word. Not even if I needed some shit. Just fucking /no. We didnt wipe but for sure I didnt bothrer maxing my dps.
---
I want someone to hear me too. I also have dreams and goals. I am not your consumable pleasant boy that you can grab your flasks and just gtfo.
---
Well, for starters I am different: female human with voice changer software over chat.

I'm a wow noob and I don't know specifically what kind of questions that can be found on Google you're referring to, but tbh many things aren't too easy to find on Google, less so if you don't know where to look.
---
Many Classic wiki are wrong and lackluster, in Vanilla wiki can be hard to figure out what patch they refer to, one single question can have 10 different answers depending on where you look.
---
Competence isn't an issue, I'm the type who likes to min max and be the best at my role and have always been able to do good at my role. I know I would be good at it my worry is that with around 40ish hours only to play a week would I be just grinding for pots and what not and would the work to be good be to much to be enjoyed.

Ohhhhh this gonna get some down votes yo.
---
You ruined it ya pleb
---
A dirt nap.
---
This was on a very empty server though. It'll be a bit different on a full realm. I wonder how fast it would've taken to get to the same level on a slower class like warrior.
---
Things pve players have no idea wtf ur talking about
---
You raised many good points, some of which I already thought about when I saw those youtuber videos or guides.
---
I myself want to form a group of 5 to play if possible but it's quite hard to sync 5 people or look for people up to try this.
---
I want to ask you something, because you said you played up to Naxx so I assume you're a very experienced player: Did you actually TRY to run this dungeon setup by yourself? Or does your experience come from theorycrafting/guides? Some notes about things you said:
---
1. The proposed healers are shaman and paladin, and druid until 40. Do you realize that paladin and shaman need to hard-cast for heals and are not mobile at all? In a melee cleave you are kind of running forward all the time, and having literally 0 instant heals hurts the speed a lot. It is truly so much faster when you can kill mobs WHILE you move forward to save travelling time and have a good in-fight uptime.
---
2. Arms is undeniably "better", for leveling normally, sure. But as you said having 1 fury seems the way to go, maybe two? I am not sure if people remember how stupidly strong "enrage" is and you have no tank, so you'll be juggling aggro most of the times, and having a 25% melee damage buff is stupidly strong. Things like imp battle shout are quite minor (Even at level 60, 5/5 it's a 40 AP buff. At lvl 30-40 it will be a very small bonus, albeit good to have on a group of 4 melees)
---
3. I agree with you with the spirit tap comment. When I saw the video I thought to myself: Sure, you're in Deadmines, and 4/4 melees have Smite's Hammer, meaning you already ran that dungeon like 20 times, of course the priest will be able to "wand" a mob down for the spirit bonus. Also in Deadmines you have a LOT of non-elite mobs for this, which's not the case in most dungeons.
---
In any other dungeon though? Especially after 30-40? How will you do that? We need to consider you need to keep your party topped up WITHOUT SHIELDS because it kills your rage generation, unless they're high at rage already, but even then it'll be a huge dps minus to cast power word shield, and you HAVE NO TANK, therefore the warriors will take much more damage than usual and you'll be clearing WITHOUT CC. IT IS HEAL-INTENSIVE, even in Deadmines and much more heal-intensive later on. I don't think you can afford to "wand" around. What if it takes you 3-4 wand hits? You need to constantly heal everyone, it might be good to get one here and there but to RELIABLY keep it up looks like an impossibility. 
---
4.  Melee-cleave can indeed AOE but most of your damage is limited to 2 mobs: Why do all the videos and guides I see pull like 5-10? Whirlwind hits up to four but cleave and sweeping strikes are limited to 2.
---
Someone will point out: "More hits received, more rage!" Yeah, sure... It's not worth that much, you'll already be tanking elite mobs without shield and many times berserker stance, and the rage generated from extra mobs is good but not worth the havoc you create by having the healer drink after every pull.
---
5. There are many tactics to improve from the guides, arm warriors (and fury ones, even though it's harder because they don't have the talent to keep 25 rage on stance swaps) can swap to def. stance, taunt and get to berserker, fill up rage, and then another warrior will do that, etc. That way you'll most of the time have rage for your instant attacks / cleave spam.
---
6. I'm surprised people don't mention windfury enough, in other servers there are farming groups of 3 fury warriors and a shaman just for windfury even if he's not the most ideal healer because how stupidly strong windfury is for warrior dps. (Windfury proccs not only give you flurry more often, but pretty much fill up your rage bar, plus the obvious windfury damage) If there's a melee cleave that's efficient it is FOR SURE one with shaman, the strength and windfury from totems plus chain heal to cope with the aggro juggling clownfiesta seems extremely good.
---
Problem is, as I said, if you run with resto shaman or holy pala you won't be mobile as most heals are hard-casted and it's way slower than having a druid hot everyone, move to next pack, pre-hot start drinking and keep drinking while fight goes on and then repeat blabla.
---
I admire you for trying, but being an asshole to new players is so ingrained in the culture of mmo players that sadly I don’t think we’ll ever change it.
---
Haha love the video. Its a bit of harmless fun and the streamers are getting salty. All the toys out of the cot.
---
Isnt the rank 10 gear pretty shit for ele, its a hybrid set right with a bunch of melee stats.
---
Make her to put some quality headphones and walk around Elwynn forest by morning. Music alone is so addicting
---
&gt;They initially said a few weeks and then updated it to being removed before phase 2.
---
You should look again just to be sure. I did and I can't find any info on what you're saying.
---
&gt;It's not static or predictable at all! What?
---
If you can't understand a concept as simple as first come first served I can't be bothered to explain to you why layers are in fact predictable.
---
You also act like each sever will have 100 layers and whenever you log in you /roll and get assigned to a random layer between 1 and 100 which is not true. Most servers will have between 1 and 4 layers and you will get assigned the first layer that has a spot for you (first come, first served). And if you log in consistently at the same times you will most likely end up in the same layer.
---
&gt;Sigh. I'm getting a bit frustrated here. People =/= you. You can do nothing and still have people in your layer constantly changing as other people join your layer and leave it.
---
You are acting like people will purposely go out of their way to group with others from other layers. Most people won't even notice layering, most people will only group with other people within their field of view which does not trigger layer hops.
---
&gt;And if a few weeks from now, your server has 25k people, what's the plan then? Will you just have a close-nit 25 thousand person group of familiar faces?
---
Even though I would absolutely love that idea I doubt servers, even with layering, will get anywhere close to 25k people. Most I can think of is 9-12k maybe 15k after which queues will kick in.
---
&gt;You are on the 12k server. The population drops 40%. Well shit. You're still stuck with 7.2k people and layering. What do? Not so bad if you're on the 8k server, in which you get dropped to 4.8k. Do they still take Layering out?
---
Hell yea you remove layering. Slap a queue on that bad boy and offer free transfers. =&gt; **no need for server merges.**
---
&gt;Let's say the population drops 80%. If you're on the 12k server, you end up with 2.4k people on your server and no layers. Not bad! Your 8k account is not so fortunate. It drops to 1.6k pop. Not great.
---
1.6k is not great but is not bad by any means (and most def still better than 400 people which would be the case for servers in server clusters). And you can recommend the server to new players to boost that number a little. That and the free transfers from the overpopulated serves can funnel players to these medium pop servers. And you can still **avoid server merges**.
---
As you can see by now the name of the game is avoid dead servers and server merges. In both cases layering avoids those while sever clusters **require** them.
---
No, but it is just a generally stupid idea to join a retro game if your only experience with gaming is Candy Crush.
---
Most people that can't look up basic information haven't played any MMO prior. As I said, why go for retro if you are competely new to the genre? 
---
Either the person cannot be arsed to google things or generally doesn't care to learn. If you are going to screw up once? Shame on me for not telling you. Wipe my dungeons multiple times because you cannot be arsed to get your shit together under the disguise of being new? Shame on you.
---
Preach man. 
---
The general rule is that the more knowledge you have the more trivil simple questions might seem to you. At one point you reach a level of knowledge that it really seems like a complete waste of time or silly to answer such question and might end casuing you to be frustrated. With all of that said it is ABSOLUTELY WRONG to think like this and as an example is that, when you meet people who are really skilled at the game they usually end up being eliteist assholes and very negative with zero tolarance to mistakes or whatnot.
---
Send good vibes, always be nice to people, if you dont have the energy to answer a certain question or invlove yourself in something than you are better off being quiet about it. Trust me some of the best most skilled players I know today and some of the best friends I made off WoW were people who were really inexperinced and would ask the so-called silly/stupid questions.
---
Try this, be nice to your group members in WoW, enforce anything good they do even if it is small, tell them how good they are doing and dont focus too much on their mistakes. You will see something amazing, where people not only have a ton of fun playing togther but overall performing SO much better because they feel like they are recognized for the good they do, not to mention the amazing long lasting friendships you make.
---
I am waiting for Classic raid boss resistances.
---
Private servers got it way wrong with boss parry chance AND crit chance.
---
They are also probably way off with resistances.
---
I read this in Moe Sizlak's voice.
---
No sharding, Layering: "Hello there"
---
Gamer girl who sells bathwater or something like that
---
Thats why im asking if its at all useful
---
I'm unsure what part you infer that gear would count, the only thing I read is that they tested various bonuses:
---
&gt; We tested a variety of modifiers to Critical Strike, such as: Berserker Stance, the Cruelty talent, and critical strike chance on gear. They all behaved the same as they did in 1.12, so we’ve concluded that there’s no bug here.
---
It might be a bit weirdly worded, but to me that just seems like they tested different bonus types, and does not imply that all those are under the "aura" tag, but maybe I'm reading it wrong.
---
I doubt it, probably need some mc/ZG pieces mixed with some pvp items to have a decent overall set.
---
A LEGEND IN MY TIME

Hahaha this is so gooooood I am dying right now

Unlike when hunters would hide their low level pet with your quest target while flagged.
---
Be kind to new people by beating the absolute shit out of them in STV. Welcome to the rice fields motherfucker.
---
They have proven to not learn from their biggest mistakes the past years regarding this MMORPG, and are continuing on that trend by adding the most hated, fail system aka shlayering into an old game that's sold as a recreation of Vanilla, except it's not, because it never at any point had anything like shlayering present.
---
This approach is a setup for failure. Blizzard is so afraid to fail, they give Classic a diaper to avoid it making a boo boo. Even though it's the best MMORPG ever created, the one that saved their own company from closing down. They have no faith in their own masterpiece, and it shows. 
---
They even call new potential players "tourists" rather than see them as an opportunity to gain a bigger audience for Classic..but to do that, they have to give them exactly that game, and they're not gonna do that apparently.
---
If Blizzard can't treat their own games with dignity, and give the people what they have asked for for YEARS, then that's gonna be an epic fail. 
---
Layering is gonna make sure they do fail, just like they assume their game would in terms of popularity in 2019. This is gonna be a PR disaster of big proportions, and will lead to many of the core audience people leaving this company for good if they pull this off. 
---
This game was supposed to be a "love letter to the community". What best way to make it such than change their beloved game for weeks or months for the sake of the servers first and foremost. /s
---
How about leaving the game the same for the sake of the people who'll be playing it throughout those weeks and months, and who'd like to enjoy it the way it was, just as was suggested they would all this time?
---
If it was common knowledge back then then you'd expect it to be mentioned somewhere. At least in some history site on wowwiki where they tried to have a site for every game mechanic. You don't see it anywhere though.
---
Horde.
---
Now i just need to decide between orc warlock and undead mage, can't decide, not sure i want to spend half my raid time trading health stones.
---
I liked stream where he did speedrun on his N Elf hunter. Definitely recommend watching him if you want to learn how to level up faster.
---
You should ALWAYS have first aid maxed out, both for your own sake and the group you play with.
---
It's not even an option not to have it imo!
---
If you look at his reddit history, he will probably be on this sub during his anniversary.
---
Its 7 indeed ;)
---
You lose the 10% parry from the boss with +5 skill.
---
there is now way to know which faction will be more popular. if wpvp is your thing i'd pay attention to where bigger guilds/streamers go Aug 13.
---
That is probably true but its meaning like most of language has evolved.
---

---
I play retail (not that much but sometimes) on a macbook pro 13 inches with an external monitor. It has a 620gpu if i remember correctly and it runs fine. So classic will do the same
---
Yes, this build is the ultimate compromise.
---
For PVE healing, you are only losing the 5% crit chance, which hurts, but is survivable.
---
For PVE tanking, you are missing holy shield and 1h spec, which is very important and will hurt your threat generation, but if the people you run dungeons with know about it, it will be fine. 
---
And for pvp burst, you are missing the dmg talents and SoC, which will reduce oyur potential quite a bit, but a reck bomb hurts even without those talents and you have superior support capabilities compared to a full ret or ret reck pvp build.
---
If you want a one size fits all build, this is the way to go, you lose out on each aspect compared to a specialized build, but it's not so detrimental to make it unviable.
---
Didn't know Reddit had a Public Service working at this subreddit ^^,
---
I would not say they are idiots. Just wrong.
---
Love this attitude
---
That human is dancing perfectly in sync with the music, im dead.
---
Both leeway and spell batching should be reduced, I won't pretend like I know best to what degree, but I would request it to be significant.
---
Times move on, let's be sensible and change these things to maintain the vanilla experience whilst realising technology changed so the speed of net is different. If vanilla was released now it's values would be less, so release classic that way.
---
Any specs were simply not viable for raiding. Specs were not exactly balanced. And most classes have one spec that will be brought into raids.
---
It's great for ench but not ele
---
Appreciate your input a lot! It is as you say it is: even though it feels weird, I'm slowly pushing through westfall and redridge currently, and man, these zones feel really polished which helps get used to them!
---
Yikes...
---
viability mainly.
---
hybrids in particular were a jack of all trades/master of none kinda thing 
---
tank specs were garbage beside prot, feral is a capable 5 man tank, but because of CB not suited for very many raid encounters. prot pally generates trash threat on mobs that aren't undead
---
Warrior is considered the premier Main Tank, however saying Tank does not necessarily mean Prot. Threat generation is very important in classic as it caps the dps that your raid can put out, something that hasn’t been a factor in retail for a while. 
---
Certain specs are shunned because they underperform significantly compared to others. It’s obviously possible for player skill, gear level and preparation (like consumables) to cover for this discrepancy. 
---
As an example a warrior or rogue of equal skill and gear will hit higher dps than a paladin. However, generally classic raids won’t require max dps from everyone (it won’t hurt though) and the above mentioned threat issues often cap dps anyway. 
---
Despite the stigma raid groups that aren’t completely hardcore will likely take a skilled warm body regardless of spec (in small numbers).
---
It's literally mentioned on the page about crit. Nevertheless, the page changed so many times that it's hard to find older versions and honestly I cba for something as widely known as crit suppression.
---
Problem with these comments is it's hard to tell if it's /s or serious.
---
I feel many nochanges calls are sarcastic but it lends the movement credence.
---
In the worst case scenario for both 5% parry and 14% the boss has the some number of possible attacks over a 5 second window depending on the tank's attack speed. 
---
On average there will be more hasted attacks.... but the worst case scenario (if all attacks in a 5 second window are hasted) is unchanged.
---
To be fair, Classic could be vague at times in terms of quest text. It's good that you didn't get everything spoonfed though, more time to figure things out yourself.
---
I need help my Classic bros! I very incompetent at this techie stuff despite reading and trying to understand it all. There's so many variables!

I have the following options of laptops to choose from, all a very similar price point. Which is the best for Classic?  Thanks!

Option 1 seems the best overall and newest GPU, but apparently Option 2 GPU is better?
---
Option 2 has the newst CPU but is only an i3 and has a HDD, not SSD.

Option 3 is older 4th gen i5 but has an SSD and an older dedicated GPU
---
Option 4 has a newer 6th gen i5, and an SSD but only integrated intel GPU

There is more, which if admitted by Blizzard (they probably will not - because it's a huge advantage to Sword &amp; Board tanks), will put an end to raid tanking : Prot Warriors using Sword &amp; Board either have an innate HIGHER hit chance or they have a SEPARATE roll attack table for hits.
---
I was a Main Tank in Vanilla, and I always prioritized +def, +str and +def gear, instead +hit gear (up to AQ40, where things change) , for a simple reason : I was rarely missing a hit, be it a white, yellow or special attack, in MC and BWL.
---
I have no idea why, because the most +hit on my gear was 2% or 3%, and normally, I should have missed a lot more. But I didn't.
---
As I said, either because Prot Warriors with 1 hander + shield have a innate higher hit chance, or because they have a different hit attack table.
---
Blizzard don't want to say how they calculate the crit loss for auras, so I can bet that they won't say that Prot Warriors have a different hit table.
---
It's just that with 2-3% hit, I never had issues with hitting bosses in MC and BWL, as a Prot Warrior with 1 hander and shield equipped.
---
Except the simple fact that it boosts your hit chance by 3% makes a subpar axe from a couple raid tiers ago much better than a supposedly "tank sword" regarding threat. The only exception being Thunderfury.
---
Never said it was the only relevant factor. I qualified my original statement with "unless healers are going oom" from the additional damage.
---
Regarding system spec, haven't been able to find how much hard drive space classic will require, anyone have an idea? Is it the same as current WoW with all the expansions? How much does that require? 
---
 Asking since I have an old computer from 2012 with a very small SSD and another bigger but way slower hard drive. Was planing to install on the SSD.
---
**Priest**
---
Priest I've played the least but they are strong levelers, and pretty much any spec you care to go is going to be fine in raids.  Things are a bit more involved when looking at the healing than the other classes so your workload is going to be higher but you've got all the tools the other healers have all on the same class.  A quick note about your race choice: Troll is objectively the best priest race, PvE or PvP, but it doesn't seem like you really care and you shouldn't.  Just wanted to make a note in case you have doubts; just stick to what you think looks cool.
---
**Shaman**
---
Let me address the viability of 30/0/21 first. It might be viable but raid leaders are going to insist on mana tide.  Not all raid leaders will, not all guilds will, but they will be the exception.  This is how it was back in vanilla, it's how it is on private servers if you are in "current content", it was even that way through BC.  You can absolutely slot in as "we need another healer who do you know/who is in the guild that pvps that we could take?"  If you want a raid spot, however, you are bringing mana tide.  That said, you'll be able to heal 5mans just fine. 
---
Now that we have that out of the way totems are really cool and you've got an answer for pretty much everything.  Managing them all, their ranges, and their timers is something of an advanced skill, especially in PvP so there is so fun depth there.  Doing things like getting someone to hit your stoneclaw totem and get stunned because they think you are going to drop earthbind when you get to them is one of the classics.  But again, you've got answers to all classes, at least enough to make their combos harder to pull off.  Tremor for locks, grounding for mages, bind/claw for hunters, etc.  
---
Out of all classes though, especially as a healer in PvP with a shield on, you absolutely dumpster rogues.  The combination of them being unable to bleed kite you, the combo of poison cleanse totem and your own casted cleanse, and flame shock keeping them out of stealth... you should toast any rogue you see (and those you don't).  Obviously it's no a free win and you've got to play well, and if he's got all his cooldowns he'll probably at least be able to escape, but it's a great match-up for you (just make sure you roll Orc!). 
---
Shaman are really more what I think of as BG kings though as out in the world if someone opens on you and you can't make it through the first stun or fear you are going to eat dirt.  I PvP'd to rank... 12(?) in vanilla and enjoyed my time in BGs more where I could support my team or light people up after they lost me in the crowd.
---
**Druid**
---
Great flexibility spec-wise and just generally. Boomkin has nearly the burst of Ele or Destro, Bear is viable as a tank throughout the game, and cat can dps at any level.  Looking at resto though you've got a great toolkit and great cooldowns but are missing some things that other healers have.  The battle-res is amazing, but you are missing a regular res.  Your single target healing is huge but prone to overheal.  You've got the most efficient single-target heal in the game but you don't have a "heal the tank to full *NOW*" spam spell, outside of a cooldown.  Unlike shaman you'll be able to raid heal as weird things like HotW deep feral (0/30/21) as all druids were given innervate in one of the vanilla patches, one of the very rare PvP builds that's just as viable in raids as it is in BGs.
---
Speaking of PvP and Shaman, Druids are the polar opposite of shaman.  Out-last, out-maneuver, out-play.  Where shaman is hoping to manage a fight with burst and totems, Druid looks to manage the fight with movement and longevity.  You'll spend a lot of your time putting some bleeds up, going bear for some damage, getting some separation to allow you to put up moonfire/swarm, cast a heal, and kiting or disrupting - and not in any particular order.  Where shaman has a totem for every situation druid has a form, and unlike shaman, you'll never run out of mana if you play correctly.  They are deeply under-appreciated by the wider community but you'll do well if you can manage the forms, which admittedly is not easy.
---
**Conclusion**
---
Sorry for the book, and I guess you can kind of see how much I've played each class by how much I wrote about each.  Hopefully you find this helpful but don't feel bad if you end up feeling like you need to play them all :D Regardless of what you pick you are sure to have a good time.  Good luck in classic.
---
As enhancement shaman i'm fine with a handshakes.
---
Well, we're not talking about Kant's categorical imperative, so good and bad in cases like this is subjective and based on comparison. 
---
I'd take wotf or hardiness+blood fury, or stoneform, or escape artist any day of the week in stead of an arbitrary stationary stealth on rogue. 
---
Yes, you can eat while stealthed, yet the other racials are so much better. Still, that's a minor concern to me. :) 
---
Thanks for your input.
---
CPU is  fine, RAM is fine. Retail WoW was really taxing on my gtx570, but this is at best "cataclysm" WoW afaik so it should run fine with room to lower graphics

 OS should be fine if you dont want to upgrade to 10. I dont know what blizz have done for compability to mess with Windows 7

Same specs as you and my pc have played all iterations of wow at some point.
---
I don't know if I'll end up playing classic but if I do I will try to just fool around in cities, meet people and probably help others like they helped me back in the day. I had my fair share of grinding in retail.
---
 I don't want classic to become retail, but I think most veterans do. To play classic you have to change your philosophy to what it was in 2006. I'm afraid that current toxic online gamer culture won't make it possible, so it's on our best interest to try and mitigate it if possible.
---
This.
---
t3 has 0 spelldmg, t2.5 on the other hand has alot  
---
also warstomp isn't as good as you think
---
That could mean that it's not as simple as a flat reduction, it could be something like X% loss from all sources
---
If my youngest brother (13.5 years younger) as a new player could figure things out himself despite never playing a single MMO, why can't others? Heck, he even uses Bing and Yahoo because he doesn't like google..
---
It certinaly factors alot in my choices.
---
Might go warlock becouse cenarious shoulders are... bushy
---
You're just trying to trigger him. Obvious troll is obvious.
---
I'll make sure to add /s next time since ppl are having a hard time figuring it out
---
Yep and it really wasn’t too bad. Got two pieces in two runs and then acquired the next few over 12 runs.
---
Aside from that I already had bits like force of will, nagelring, golems skull, etc
---
Getting to the point of barely receiving crits from dungeon trash doesn’t take long
---
&gt; Next you got 70% chance to not get knockbacked from casting healing spells. Again, not very effective in pvp as lessers cast speed is fast enough for knockbacks to not even matter, and youll most likely get spellcountered, silenced, or stunned before youll take knockback.
---
That sentence alone reveals, this is either a troll post or you are clueless about pvp.
---
Ditching the Dwarven Handcannon for Rhok’ was the highlight of my hunter’s life in classic.
---
i played ele sham for pvp all throughout vanilla, even made pvp video, heck yeah.
---
but i dont know the talents i used 13 years ago anymore.
---
pretty sure i had natures swiftness, and pretty sure it was the only talent that made me win a lot of encounters. you sometimes need that instaheal, and sometimes you need that instabolt.
---
another thing you maybe CANNOT understand, because you never played vanilla WoW (thats what i read out of your text):
---
Vanilla and classic are NOT BALANCED the way modern WoW is.
---
there were more useful classes and more niche classes.
---
more useful specs and less useful specs.
---
not every class can do everything in classic.
---
the game is very DIFFERENT from modern WoW and if you complain about imbalances before you even played classic (again, just an assumption here), YOU WONT STAND classic gameplay. it is VERY imbalanced, and certain specs are just WAY MORE BAD in pvp and pve than other specs.
---
thats just the way it is, nothing you can do.
---
that said, i still had some fun playing a well geared ele sham, but always lube your asshole when out in the open, because you gonna get fucked, alot. also, no one wants you in Raids, if you dont have a good guild, no way you gonna get gear.
---
you want your char to feel OP? get everything easily? balanced gameplay? 
---
GoTo ReTaiL
---
I've been getting my gf into wow, she played a bit during legion and has been playing on pservers to try out classes. She's really liking priest but is worried about healing and being flamed for letting people die.
---
 We've all been new to wow at some point and shouldn't be shitty if people are at least trying their best.
---
If stun resist didn't apply to grenades, it would be pretty even. Tauren is actually pretty good, but since grenades are such a fixture of PvP, there's just no way around the fact that orcs win. As a warrior, you even have the opportunity to do a 31/5/15 spec for an additional 15%, putting you at fucking 40% stun resistance and have a character that's an arms beast in PvP and an acceptable tank in PvE.
---
this is brilliant haha
---
First of all: That's not a PSA. 
---
Secondly: Classic isn't even out yet and you're complaining about a problem that doesn't exist?
---
I'm creating a character on all EU English speaking servers once they allow to pick your name. Then I spend a month looking up unofficial servers of other languages and pick one where there's no hordes of italians, serbs or whatever.
---
Gotta love me dem holy pally bros.
---
Hahahaha loved it ty
---
Orc is objectively the better choice for PvP, warstomp is excellent but hardiness is just plain better.  You are unlikely to kill anyone in a stomp stun but tons of classes can kill you in a single stun.  Orc also has the AP bonus which is actually fairly substantial if used correctly.  The best Tauren racial is the reach, honestly, but if you aren't interested in Enh it's actually a detriment due to how melee ranges work targeting you.  The extra health is pretty neato too but really Tauren makes much more sense for Warrior as you'll typically be okay eating stuns with heals more than a Shaman would be. 
---
That said, play what looks cooler.  It deciding who is going to win a PvP fight the racial matchup is way down the list.  There just so much else that's more important than who has hardiness or extra hp or whatever.  If you like the idea of being BIG COW then play tauren.
---
sounds like you're on the spectrum
---
Stun resist will help vs warstomp in a same faction duel.
---
Wich essentially is a useless mechanic.
---
Youre gonna get out of some of them sure, but its mostly in a 1v1 vs a class with stuns.
---
And the same can be said for taurens, getting that extra stun CAN essentially help you aswell. The same goes for cannibalize for UD. 
---
There will be times in certain aspects of the game where the stun resist will save you, but just the extra health a Tauren gets can also do that.
---
And dont forget Warrior pvp trinket removes stuns aswell.
---
Why do you say that?
---
I've been playing shaman on pserver for the past 2 years. I know what I'm talking about and I'm not changing my stance on this
---
nature resist does nothing against your hit chance, spell penetration is what matters when your talking about nature resist.
---
everyone with motw has nature resist (+20)
---
90% chance to hit is pretty shit, mages will waste 4 talent points in pvp just to get hit cap on all 3 schools (fire/frost/arcane) untill they get it from gear.
---
crit is one of the best stats for elemental shaman.
---
NS can be used both offensively and defensively elemental mastery is only good for pub stomping its like pom pyro meme mages, everyone thinks theyre good except for the people who play mages because they understand waiting 3minutes to secure a kill is shit.
---
you ask if 5% crit is worth going all the way in resto for and the answer is yes, if your gonna waste 20 points why waste them on the garbage in the enh tree, atleast the 5% crit talent is pretty fucking good.
---
the only ok talent in enhance is imp ghost wolf and even then its not worth it, still a 1 second cast after talents can be interupted and purged off, why bother?
---
tl;dr if your gonna waste 20 points you might as well get 5% crit cuz its your best stat and the alternative is useless and elemental master is a meme spec you should be going for sustained killing power and always be a threat not relying on a 3minute cooldown to kill someone.
---
I'm guessing you're trolling. 
---
Please research the word spectrum.
---
New people don't have to be bad people, but there is a group that somehow exists and doesn't disappear that refuse to think for themselves.
---
You can go out of your way to be nice, you can be a jackass on purpose or you could choose to do a middleway approach. I see no reason to be nice to players but I see no reason to antagonize them.
---
If someone messes stuff up unintentionaly and they couldn't adjust, just kick them and move on. There is need no give them a jab afterwards just as it isn't needed to be nice towards them just because they are new.
---
Oh boy the nostalgia hits hard.
---
This is the truth right here. Hunters farming for their mount from 40-43/44 while continuing to quest/grind humanoids is faster then worrying about buying the mount at 40. Speed runners take this into account and have routes that don’t require extensive traveling in the early 40’s.
---
Warlock is a class where I feel like you need to enjoy their playstyle to get the most out of them. Plus side is both classes have great class quests: locks have all the demon summoning ones while hunters have the one best epic quest for Rhok'delar.
---
if true how can you justify 90% hit rate and not knowing how spell hit/spell resistance/spell penetration work?
---
I hadn't given a thought to the layering aspect.
---
I still don't really have the brainspace to do so, but I hope it doesn't ruin the experience... :(
---
Give me a good mage spec for both pvp and pve then
---
Fun fact, you can remove parry haste entirely on druid vs most bosses because they have 2.5 attack speed, the same as the bear. Since auto attacks sync up automatically the druid maul being parried causes no attack speed increase in the boss if the druid isn't wearing a manual crowd pummeler.
---
Druids on my server had a community or at least I knew most of them. I don't think I'll know many in my class this time around though.
---
You'll still have money and gear, just slightly less of it. As compensation you possess valuable information about who not to group or join guilds with, which may pay off greater in the longer run.
---
To a lesser extent. I had a paladin chat channel back in the day where the 25 or so paladins from the top raiding guilds and pvp groups talked about builds, gear and what they do. We also ran pala only runs of dungeons from time to time and in tbc even a pala only karazhan.
---
When Wotlk came around, from those 25 only a handful remained active and by cata the channel was dead.
---
Ones character is allowed to be tired after all the walking
---
The class discords are really active (and usually have better info than this sub) so the class communities are strong already.
---
you actually are, aren't you? fucking hell
---
30 times? Holy crap. I know one of the new strats involves intentional deaths but I suspect after the first 10-15 levels those stop being a thing, which means a good two dozen or so unintentional deaths.
---
Remember that every raid only really needs one main tank. At most two. Most other warriors are expected to be geared and specced for maximum dps. While warriors are a very popular class to get into raids (most raids will want at least 8 of them), remember that you might not be that desired MT spot to get the first Thunderfury, unless you can promise your raid lead to have a 100% attendance on raid night.
---
I still can't make up my mind if I should play rogue or hunter. 
---
Mainly I'm a PvE:er. I've played both on hardcore raiding level on private servers, all though hunter a bit more serious and I would say I'm better at it.
---
Here's Why I would wanna go rogue:
---
*I have much more fun with it in pvp and during the lvling
---
*I like the aesthetics of the class armors more
---
*I've loved their abilities and play style since the release of wow
---
But I kind of suck at it in pve and thats off putting to me, Ive tried watching guides etc. I also feel like there will be a lot more rogues than hunters which mean more competition with the good rogues.
---
and for hunter:
---
*I enjoy the PvE game MUCH more and am much better at it
---
And thats kind of it. Whats off putting with hunter is all the work and time I have to put in compared to rogue. Time is valuable for me as I study atm.
---
The demon quest for MC bow (fuck I hate that part), collecting and training pets for the right abilities, standing around in duskwood for 2 days looking for that fucking wolf etc.
---
I feel confident that I will be able to outperform most other hunters for spots in good guilds, so you dont have to hit me with the argument that its harder to get raid spots as hunter.
---
Please convice me which one to pick for my main.
---
Just a word of warning about specs.  Priest healing builds are fairly content agnostic, meaning you can spec pretty much how you want as long as you hit the important stuff no one is going to care.
---
On the other hand, if you plan on raid healing, 30/0/21 just won't be acceptable in all but the most casual of guilds.  Manatide is just too good and too important.  
---
If you intend to gear a bit in raids and then quit to PvP when BGs drop then it doesn't matter but if you want to do both at the same time Priest is the better option.
---
yawn.
---
Just because YOU dont see the facts in my arguments, doesn't mean they aren't there.
---
You just refuse to see what is plainly in front of you. Thanks for proving to me you can't argue worth a damn and use the same old tired "it's just a defense of ip hurr" and "Gray area" of law.
---
Once again, Taking World of Warcraft made by Blizzard Entertainment and publicly distributing it and making money off of it is I L L E G A L
---
(Like the caps? :))))) )
---
Until you get these FACTS through your thick skull there's no point in even trying to argue.
---
Not in my groups. You roll need; you equip it. Disagree? Find another group.
---
if true, you should know how it is and i dont get the point of your post.
---
blizz wont change the talents
---
Hey, we went over this already. If nostalgia was the primary factor, private servers would have been just fine and Blizzard wouldn't release classic servers. 
---
But we're here now. Next month Blizzard releases Classic. There are no rose-tinted goggles.
---
Well written response and some tips, thanks 😀 (I'm not OP)
---
ns is a 3 minute cooldown too... 
---
5%  mana pool plus whatever is left in the ele tree that you couldnt afford to put talent points in, now you can and it's not garbage. A lot of stuff there is great for pvp
---
And the Tauren Warrior circlejerk in that video is Soda misunderstanding the hitbox increase that Taurens are getting in Classic right now. Serendipity (pretty sure that is who is making the argument) is absolutely right that the increased hitbox would not be an advantage against a mage that is playing properly because they can also be hit from further away negating the reach advantage. 
---
Serendipity is wrong about one thing though, in the Beta Taurens do have a smaller deadzone (which I believe is incorrect and should be how Serendipity is describing as the deadline just being further away) so they do have an advantage against Rogue's that rely on kiting away from melee range without being Intercept. 
---
So do you really think an advantage against a single class only in dualing that might be a bug is really worth it over all the other advantages Orcs provides?
---
Im thinking &lt;Fish and Chips&gt; for a guild name.
---
That or &lt;Yorkshire Pudding&gt;
---
Well, yeah, you won't be AS strong as when tbc was endgame, but why would someone stop playing with 6 xpacs left to play? Bfa is balanced with the scaling in mind, so you're still blowing stuff away when you get some gear. If it scaled to your gear score that would be different.
---
Feral tanks are viable in raids, especially the lower tier raids due to higher threat generation with MCP. This has been proven numerous times. There were guilds running Naxx with Feral tanks on at least 50% of all encounters.
---
Expectation is in the eye of the beholder.
---
Is the elitism directed at new people or at people who have the "Vanilla is about fun, not min-maxing/addons/etc." mentality? Because I'm fairly sure it's to the latter, who are elitist in their own way.
---
What are XP exploits
---
So... naming day is the 23rd, yeah?
---
Doesn't that mean that +crit% chance stat loses a lot of value compared to AP and agi? Like as soon as you have the choice you'll definitely avoid +crit% I think.
---
If those are classes you want to play then go for it, this setup will work well. 
---
One synergy you are missing out on though is armor type. You'll get plate/chainmail, leather, and cloth drops, but no one will be able to take advantage of plate/chain, while warlock and priest have to share cloth drops.
---
how about troll? (i like the raptor mounts haha)
---
I've also found that speedrunning raids improves players' performance a lot. Especially tanks and melee as they have to be on the ball and save the raid when something unexpected happens.
---
&gt; The formulas seem to work with percentpoints everytime
---
Oh right. That's a pretty huge difference.
---
Not really. It's always beating your own time.
---
Except for the cream of the crop who actually have a chance at best time ever.
---
Rage is a huge issue when tanking dungeons in vanilla. Here are some general tanking guidelines that might help you out:  
---
**MARKING:** In dungeons, always ask to become the leader, bind "Skull" and "Cross" marks on easily-accessible buttons that you can press between every pull. It will save time and you can do it in combat as well. Even people on auto-pilot will usually stick to killing Skull first, and with Cross, they would usually leave it for a second kill. This way, you only need to focus your threat building and rage spending on mostly one target, moreover your pulls become fluid with little downtime (unless the healer needs it), so the DPS become less restless. If a third target needs to be CC'd I usually mark it with Moon (can bind that one too). I'd usually let my party know what my marks mean in the beginning of the dungeon.
---
**OPENER**: Always open up with Sunder Armor (if specced protection and high enough level - with Shield Slam), or Revenge. Make sure you slap a Sunder or a Revenge on any of the other adds or they'll start running for your healer. 
---
**AOE TANKING:** Demo shout's threat generation is so minuscule that you might as well not do it. It's usually only a good tactic used in combination with damage-reflection items and usually works in raids, where people are told to stop DPS for several seconds. In dungeons, you should just tab between targets and make sure to apply at least a sunder or two on each target to set you off.
---
**ABILITY THREAT PRIORITY:** A basic rule of thumb for split-second decisions and optimal rage-to-threat efficiency spending should be this -&gt; Revenge&gt;Shield Slam&gt;Sunder Armor&gt;Heroic Strike. Sunder Armor is your baseline threat ability. Think of Revenge as roughly 2 Sunder Armors. Shield Slam - more or less 3. Heroic Strike depends on your weapon - if it hits harder (either a crit, or in general a slower weapon) it could be slightly more than one sunder, sometimes lower. Never use Cleave, it gives no extra threat and is a huge rage waste. Heroic Strike should only be used if you have above 60-70ish rage and you know you are getting more. Thunderclap is useless in dungeons, don't even think about it. You should remove Rend from your bars as well.
---
**TAUNTING:** Always perform some threat ability after a Taunt. A Taunt only forces the mob to attack you and puts you at 100% threat on the threat table. You need more than 110% threat to gain aggro. What I'm saying is, if you just Taunt a mob and just auto-attack, it will most probably turn around and beat its original target after 3 seconds (Same applies for Mocking Blow). So, always use a Sunder or a Revenge after a Taunt, otherwise it's a waste. Don't be afraid to use AoE taunt for just a singular mob if it means saving someone in your party.
---
**MISC:** Some common rage situations and my thoughts during those encounters:
---
1) I know the mob is about to get loose, but my rage is hovering between 8-12. Solution: Revenge if proc is available, if not Shield Block -&gt; force a Revenge proc and then use Revenge. OR Mocking Blow and make sure to build enough rage for either a Sunder or Revenge.  
---
2) I'm at 15-18 rage and I could spend it right now, or wait one more second for Shield Slam. Solution: wait for Shield Slam. Shield Slam could be worth roughly 3 Sunders in terms of threat, even more if it crits.
---
3) Just lost a threat of a mob and is now attacking a DPS. Solution: do not waste ANY rage trying to get it back. Taunt/Mocking Blow immediately, or let it go if it's close to death.
---
Apologies for the long-winded post, but I thought having a general idea of how tanking (in my opinion) is done, as well as the mindset needed, would better help you manage your rage-spending choices.
---
Right, so human and orc is actually significantly better in raids than other warriors?
---
Most stuns are undispellable non-magic effects.
---
Do you mind elaborating a little bit on what you mean you’re low on the priority list? I’m just confused why helping other people get R14 doesn’t in turn help you get the same amount of honor. I know I’m missing something

Talking about the big battles afterwards is super cool and all but being part in it is quite lame (10% tidi/lots of lag/disconnects) 
---
i enjoyed the small 100 vs 100 fights way more
---
True, it's like a grating 8bit sample from the Commodore 64 or Amiga period.
---
Depends on the game and what level you play it at. For instance Starcraft pros rarely age over 25 and definitely not 30. Most have their haydays in the early 20s and then drop off with age. 
---
But you also just lose practice when you've taken a break for a long time.
---
280% if you want to be pedantic, but that’s not at all what I meant. It’s off by 9% actual parry chance.
---
As did I lol
---
Haha this is much better than the previous wow related one of these posted here.
---
You get preraid bis in 5man, then raid as resto for ele/resto pieces. As shaman you wont be too bad in just dungeon gear tho.
---
Hit me up in a Dm with a new valid link. That one ran out. Cheers
---
What abilities are you using?
---
Revenge and Sunder armor are the ones that are most important for thread-generation. For more than 2 targets Demo-shout also becomes very viable. Don't waste rage on stuff like rend!
---
DPS should of course be wary of that aswell. If they precast before the pull or start doing damage before you had the chance to use one of your abilities, they are doing something wrong!

This means that there is a total of 17,593 items in Classic.
---
Found this out by CTRL+F and then typing in 'png' which brought up a count of every image file on that page.
---
classic is a bit more forgiving since you slowly level up and dungeon difficulty slowly increases so that you're well adjusted by the time you are level 50+.  just join a nice comfy guild, take your time and enjoy the journey.   its the friends and adventures together that make mmo's special.
---
also fuck heriloom gear. (is not in classic wow thank fuck)
---
I think the misinformation of people with no fucking idea is much more harmful to new people, this reddit feels like mmo-champion
---
Not how it works, they are just bigger. They distance they hit AND get hit from is 9+ yds
---
Actually I think you've arrived a pretty interesting question.  In a question of *viability* Druid is absolutely superior to Shaman when looking at the classes and all their specs as a whole.
---
Bear is absolutely completely viable and out-threats all warriors at all gear levels without thunderfury.  Bear is utterly untouchable on the threat table in the early phases.  
---
Boomkin is absolutely viable in 5mans where they can drink between pulls and bosses.
---
Cat is hunter-tier dps at all gear levels and offers rare druid utility that you don't need to eat up a healer spot to get.  
---
And resto is resto.  Regardless of what turbonerds from private server say, guilds will always be looking for druid healers.
---
*The problem however is that druid has to work so much harder to be viable.*
---
Ele and Enh can just brainlessly do acceptable damage in 5mans without working excessively hard.  They don't have to farm obscure consumables and don't have to deal with extreme mana issues or power shifting.  Resto Shaman is easier to play in a raid setting where you are mostly chain healing and not much else.  With druid overhealing is a big concern but chainheal (while expensive) avoids overhealing while the shaman's input.
---
As someone that's played both Shaman just isn't truly *raid viable* as anything that isn't x/x/31.  Druid is but they have to do a ton of work to get there.  
---
Hope that helps.
---
Haha yes, that's correct. Not all of them are actively used in the game though. There are a lot of 'TEST' prefixed items.

You get mobs stripped off you in 3 ways.

1) Gear Difference  
---
2) Skill Difference

3) Aoe vs Single target mis-match.

Sounds like his main target is getting nuked by 1 or 2.  Should probably just pile threat into the main target, or cc-tank the main target if its a 5-man.

What if we add in him calling out Lana! at 70%, Lanaaaa! at 80%, and LANAAAAA!!! at 90%, then Danger Zone at 95%?
---
Serves you right for ganking a 30 when you are 40.. Classic weak minded horde can have a fair scrap.
---
think overpower shares cooldown with revenge. you wont want to use overpower
---
also i should point out that people don't pick up ancestral healing for the armor, they pick it up for the dispel protection, its actually really useful when you throw heals at your flag carrier because its another junk buff that has to be purged off.

If Omen threat meter gets remade for classic, or if somebody decides to make a new one they will likely have a threat warning sound built in.
---
Back when threat was still a normal part of gameplay it was standard for all threat meter addons to warn you, either visually or through sound.
---
How to always hold aggro at low level:
---
Step 0; Mark stuff.
---
Step 1; Make sure you have Tactical Mastery

Step 2; Charge in (if you know you won't bodypull two packs), switch to Defensive Stance mid-charge.
---
Step 3; Battle Shout, it generates stupid amounts of threat.
---
Step 4; Stack a few Sunders per mob, start stacking threat on your secondary target when the first reaches ~30% health (vary to your needs, obviously). Mash Revenge when it's up.
---
Step 5; Never EVER use Shield Block unless you're tanking a single target and you know you're well ahead on threat. Trading a lot of rage for a fairly negligible amount of mitigation isn't worth it unless you're getting pounded.
---
Other things; make sure you taunt as needed. For AoE packs, don't be afraid to use Battle Shout liberally. It generates a lot of threat, even if you're just refreshing the buff.
---
This is how I tanked while leveling my warrior on K3. Never really dropped aggro, tanked as Arms in dungeons until ~level 50.
---
For druids: Mash Maul, keep Demo Roar and Faerie Fire up, tab-Swipe when tanking 3 targets or more.
---
Atleast stuns have a DR.
---
If a hunter is keeping me at range dancing around his freezing trap, I will want that extra 2yards.
---
Anyways, I do not discount hardiness.
---
I just think that both races have their advantages and disadvantages. Being a diehard tauren fan I'm pleased to have the extended range again, because they never got it to work on private servers.
---
Therefore having a fully functioning race with all its ups and downs is something I appreciate.
---
On an anecdotal note. It was even on pserver called. F e e nix, because the +25% AP from orc racial was calculated *after* all AP contributions from gear, not the base AP. 
---
Combine that with sweeping strikes being able to eat more than one stack of it in a whirlwind and orc warriors could easily deal 10.000 to 20.000 damage in one swing if WF was provided. Shit was ridiculous.
---
I remember in vanilla having a 3 sunder rule before dpsing(as a 60 mage). 1 sunder may not be enough. Maybe try for 2 before dps opens up. Also...my tip as a mage is “you want me to sheep something?”
---
thanks to layers they even encourage it, the faster tourists quit the faster layers are gone and we get a more true vanilla experience
---
yeah this time around these people cant pay the people running the servers to get their drops on the first MC run
---
i remember on Ely seeing one pvp guild with like 3 bonereavers edge by the time i had even entered MC.  we ran it a fuck ton and of course never got 1
---
No. Because healing is a waste of damage potential. Why would I waste a second healing when I'm in melee combat if I'm more focused first on casting off a frost shock and putting down earth bind totem to kite them away?? Then I'll heal
---
In a nut shell yer. I don't mind some of the changes they have made, but the core mechanics of the game are way out of wack.
---
Thank you for sharing this lovely memory. I hope to see something similar in classic!
---
It's actually hilarious, if you post something like "Games are about having fun and I find it fun to try my hardest to perform well while playing with likeminded individuals" you'll unironically be met with "stFu FuCKing eLiTiSt AsshoLe, i'M GOiNg tO PLaY a mouSEcLicKiNG rET palaDIN [ANd/Or boOMkIn] wItH No adDOns WHiLE FapPInG wiTh ThE OTher HAnd, i WILl InTENTIonalLy DO eveRyTHInG I caN To SaBotAGE evEry GROUp i'm IN And YOu shOuLD caRRy me becauSe THATs HoW We clAssiC"
---
Nope. I pvped with that talent before and i noticed no difference. It's a 1.5 second cast for fucks sake. They Interupt the first .5 seconds.
---
&gt;if they find two separate accounts being logged into the same IP, they’ll wonder, and it’s easy to trace two accounts in two different names being logged in with the same IP
---
He lives with the guy,
---
&gt; My housemate and I
---
They already have the same IP. Blizzard aren't banning accounts for playing on the same IP.
---
You can make a bootable usb through the media creation tool from microsoft. When you install w10 you can select that you don't have a product key and voila you can use w10. You are restricted to a couple things such as: changing your taskbar settings, the watermark on the bottom right hand corner, change lock screen, etc.
---
That’s because it’ll be some time before it actually drops.
---
Thanks Josh!
---
It's more the opposite  - easiest to get your prebis for raiding first, and focus on just resto raiding (ideally until phase 3 since there are no bgs before that anyway), and then swap some pieces when doing pvp.
---
Yea but shamans are only horde side so dispelling from priests is unlikely as they are too busy healing to worry about playing offensively. Just doesnt happen
---
You rotate people in and out in order to ensure the person you want to be R14 gets R14 that week, as only one person can. If you didn't then you'd simply have to play 24 hours a day every day for 12 straight weeks in the hopes that no one else has, or if they are that you're somehow more efficient.
---
This leads to a priority list, partly ordered by what classes benefit more, partly by who leads, etc etc but the end result is that since healers benefit the least from R14 gear you just aren't likely to do it.
---
It's also not worth it as a healer, it's such an INSANE grind it's unreal and to be a great healer in PvP you require raid gear, so you'd need to be able to spare 18 hours a day to R14 grind AND however many hours a week to raid, but you can't not PvP because of ranking brackets and decay, miss even a day and you've set yourself back a minimum of a week.
---
np brah
---
You sure its not because it appeared in P2? Thanks for the reply!
---
not sarcastic?
---
because I agree and lighting shield does like an extra shock after all charges go off
---
Agreed, here.
---
I tried this on the stress test, you ress in kharanos, not in Coldridge Valley unlike pservers, so you save a few mins there
---
I don't intend to speedrun but briefly checked out Hakurai:s leveling videos. The issue I see with his route, at least the first 20 levels or so, is he was doing quests much lower then himself in Darkshore and Westfall( skipped the northern part early and later returned) quite often killing grey mobs. 
---
 I do think his route looks great for a warrior but if you are playing something else that is stronger solo I would think it would be much better to take on more level appropriate quests and mobs. 
---
 Last private server I played on for example I took an alliance lock to around level 25. I entered Duskwood very early. Some mobs were even red but since warlock is so strong solo it was not an issue( suppression is a great talen to get 5/5 in if you intend to do this). Benefit of doing this is better income and more chance to get item upgrades that are fit for your level.
---
Whatever, you're just jealous people have better opinions than yours
---
Nailed it. I hope any company looking to make an mmo stumbles upon this list. Well done
---
It's absolutely hilarious how many of you private server frauds and retail babies are talking out of your ass despite being incapable of imagining a situation where spell batching creates fun and skillful plays.
---
Pre tier 3 Paladins better than priest even in pve, speaking as a priest.
---
Paladin is absolutely fucking insane in both pve and PvP. They are amazing. They are the sole reason alliance is better in pve than horde and arguably in premade PvP despite racials.
---
Yeah priests are versatile and Paladins tend to spam one heal type but they do it very well.
---
We're talking about speed running here, not general leveling to cap, silver is a resource you use to get there faster, not something you save up for your epic mount, pre-bis boes or leveling professions.
---
And while you're absolutely correct that ress sickness slows you down quite a lot if you're actually trying to kill shit, you need to remember once you get past the 30s you'll have plenty of times where you're traveling and handing in shit for 10 min straight without killing anything.
---
If you're raiding as a dps fury warrior then it doesn't matter too much. Once you get some good weapons, hit gear, and use consumables well then you'll still kick ass at dps. In a hardcore guild it might show your commitment, if nothing else.
---
”I dont want to see this shit anymore”
---
Well I dont want to see your crying anymore, so you should go away right?
---
[UtsunomiyaPhil](https://www.reddit.com/user/UtsunomiyaPhil/) removed the last one as he said its not related to classic wow I mentioned it by name but that's not enough so now I included the logo to give it an upgrade!
---
I'm not denying that at all. I'm just pointing out a subtle difference that is true for most Microsoft products, that it might work technically, but it doesn't mean it's rightful usage. Of course in a home environment there is no real risk of getting caught.
---
If the damage dealers are instantly attacking before you can establish your threat or each engage a different target, it is probably not your fault if you have trouble holding aggro. If the group does not wise up, I would focus on keeping the healer alive and ignoring mobs on the damage dealers until the healer is safe.
---
I enjoy the challenge of making a meme-spec work. It’s boring playing the best class for each role.
---
[Helblinde] has come online.
---
Honestly everything you mentioned is stuff that bothers me but i can live with most of it. The biggest issue for me is playing the patch instead of the expansion. Not sayibg i wouldnt want the other things changed if possible and for instance i have high hopes that with the level squish talent trees are coming back in some way, maybe in addition to the current system and i would be glad to see it but yeah, ad long as wow is just playing the patch i probably wont play PvE again in any meanibgful way, i just came back to the game till classic comes out but im just doing some PvP, i love raids and was always a PvEer but playing the patch makes it meaningless to me. I used to love farming gear in raids but as of right now im happy with doing it once for the challenge, the motivation to go back to farm gear for it to be irrelevant in a few months is very slim
---
And then they did the same thing all over again with negative armor later haha.
---
&gt;But the lack of security updates is at least alarming.
---
Please stop spreading FUD. [Windows 7 is supported until January 2020, and is still receiving security updates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support).
---
After January this is a different story, but currently, you are at no extra risk by using Windows 7.
---
wow that is slower than i would have thought :O
---
Me too but I agree with people who are against pvp gear and flying mounts. A vanilla expansion learning from the mistakes of the past would be ideal imo. Of course this would be way down the line.
---
In 5 mans I find it usefull to mark the dps a skull and let them nuke it down. Meanwhile you can build threat on the other mobs. You may throw a taunt on skull but you dont have to. Normally a Rouge etc. can easily stand the dmg from one mob.
---
Why not to play the Top Gun song?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUsFWO08CO0
---
If you don't love playing as that class then holy crap you're in for a bad time though.
---
Sub par dps in PVE, easily kited in pvp.
---
With luck ( windfury / crit ) You'll do tremendous burst.
---
PVE in raids, ENH shamans have some merit as '' totemtwisters '' if you want to squeeze what you can out of them. Or you could just find a guild that accepts sub optimal speccs. 
---
Class comboes are all a choice in the end, and it depends on what you want in the game, imo.
---
You can survive, but Shaman has 1 God Tier spec, and that is Resto.  
---
The Shit tiers are ele and enhance.  
---
For leveling enhance is fine, but end game content and/or PVP is not desirble to play this.  
---
But hey, who is keeping you, from playing this, you can always respec :D
---
priest dispell 2 buffs at a time vs shamans single buff purge. trust me, any priest who isn't a potato will be purging.
---
definitely not sarcastic!  i think people really underestimate ele shaman damage in pvp
---
i remember back in the day when i played a rogue i would be trying to kill a resto shaman and lightning would slowly be wearing me down while he stood there with 5k armour healing away once my stuns ended lol
---
Yeah, what I was saying about itemization, yeah? Nothing you did before the current dungeon matters at all. :(
---
Well general consensus is either gonna be play what you want meta be damned, or they are one of the least desired specs in both pve and pvp.
---
WoW Classic does NOT have the multithreading nor DX12 support from the 8.1 engine.
---
&gt; Private server heroes hate spell batching because it's not what they're use to
---
&gt; Retailers hate it for the same reason
---
These are not facts. You just made some shit up to try and shame people into submission by calling them "private server heroes" and "retailers", while you actually have no clue what kind of people they are. You are just another gatekeeper who refuses to use real arguments, instead stooping to ad-hominem fallacies and shaming.
---
The spell Queue was brought in 2.3.
---
There was a tiny era of wow history where Spell Queue + Spell Batch was in play.
---
The land of cowards
---
And don´t waste rage on a single mob you lost (unless it is attacking a healer) DPS should nuke it down. Especially if its already at low HP
---
EPGP is garbage: what happens is that a guild will force you to take items you don't want, or, upgrades will get DE'd.
---
The key thing to understand about raiding guilds imho is that the culture and fairness of the guild is more important than the actual loot system they use by a long way.
---
Also on that page:  To avoid security risks and viruses, Microsoft recommends you upgrade to Windows 10.
---
Its better to upgrade to Windows 10 , period.
---
(point taken that it still has security updates, but im doubtfull if it receives weekly updates.)
---
Classic doesn't support multithreading at all.
---
Not everyone thinks PvP and raiding are all that matters. 
---
That's the beauty of classic, we can all play how we want.
---
Tbf that's normally my response unless it's a quest where the text doesn't make it any easier.
---
Teach a man to fish and all that.
---
I heard that on the beta servers are being layered even with just a few hundred people online. This goes against us being told that each layer would consist of a 3000 player cap. It seems layering is now seen by Blizzard as a tool of convenience so players can level in quiet zones with no interruption. This is the same mindset that ruined retail. We WANT to see players everywhere with lots of interaction and pvp. Please don't kill Classic. You promised us Vanilla.
---
Yeah I've looked up many stuff on youtube so I know about this. The deadzone seems kinda shitty but hey, its ok.
---
I will not. Was thinking at first to play horde though and roll a troll warrior. A troll tank at 60 is probably more memorable for people, not that many, same if you would have an undead 60 warrior.
---
Well explain how you use meme.
---
Isnt it 8 levels ?
---
Let me rephrase then. You'll most likely spend a lot more time at 60 than at 1-59 combined. At 60, the orc racials are significantly better.
---
Make a macro for /roll. And /spit
---
"shut up you're wrong"
---
You're hilarious.
---
Better to take the time to upgrade now rather than right after Phase 3 releases.
---
1- Spell batching is a bit slow and really messing with a few classes like hunter's FD.  But acceptable. Probably should be shortened. 
---
2- Leeway is just bad. Its clearly applying to mobs also. Wish someone would test the strongest kiting method from vanilla tbc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBOCOfSyORc  
---
Furthermore, in much like batching i could see giving a 1.33 but 2.66 is just a lot.
---
3- i have watched a lot of videos and rarely do i see melee working like this in vanilla. I think the issue here is spell queuing, leeway, plus low latency. Compounding this issue.
---
I never understood the concept of wanting to go level in Elwynn as a NE,  unless you have friends you want to level with. The cat mount is so much cooler than the horse, at least imo.
---
Demo shout is good when you have lots of mobs to tank because it generates the same amount of thread on every mob. Healing thread will get devided through the number of mobs. So the more mobs there are, the easier it will be to hold aggro against a healer with demo shout and have the time to sunder every mob.
---
with a 16debuff slots i can see 1 shadowpriest slot being consistant for raids but beyond that meme specs get downtalking by elitists because they just arn't as good. having a boomkin in raid is gonna cause you to wipe but its far from bis raid member.
---
Run, fast
---
Thank you. Updated. Unsure on the robes, I'm going with what I've got.
---
It implies it's down to the expansion and not the guild.
---
Mark a skull, pull with range weapon, cast bloodrage and battleshout  for threat then sunder the skull.
---
Not to mention everyone who beat him did so on private servers with dynamic spawns enabled and used to it's full potential, or by layer abusing on the beta.
---
As I said to the other guy, you're making it sound as if it's down to the expansion, and not the guild.
---
Could have just cropped it out
---
One of my first thoughts when I heard about classic.. 
---
Oh god... not MC again. Stilll traumatized.
---
You're claim appears to be incorrect according the the data from the beta...
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
Uhmmm maybe in the fact they're both amphetamines...
---
Meth however is made of extremely toxic chemicals that destroy your brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys and vastly more potent because of how fast it crosses the blood brain barrier.
---
BUT IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
---
Yea they are really bad. Besides i just don’t understand ppl rolling enh. Fun? Is it fun to have 1 active skill which attacks with massive cd and 1 shock every couple of sec? Playing enh is basicly autoattacking. In pve you just stand and autoattack and do less than hunters pet. In pvp pretty much everyone can kite you and if they cannot they pretty much can kill you with literally no problem. Sulfuras wf crit compilations yeah sure. Only none of you enhs will get that sulf and wf proc where every hit crits...please... if you wanna backpadle and handicap yourself and your buddies at least go ele, but neither ele nor enh will work in raids and i cannot understand the „fun” comming out of playing unplayable specs.
---
while i dont disagree that the pushback talent is mandatory it is the next best thing to pick up once you get spell hit from gear.
---
as for kiting rogues its wishful thinking to think your getting away from them without the assistance of some other class, crippling slow is more powerful than frostshock or earthbind and throw in mind numbing and your in for a sad time.
---
shaman also dispelled 2 bluffs at a time, are you high?
---
&gt;No, it isn't Nostalgia.  Here are some of the reasons I can't wait for Classic Wow:
---
&gt;1.	Server community matters;
---
Not really. 
---
&gt;2.	Green and blue gear are relevant;
---
Irrelevant. 
---
&gt;3.	Clearing difficult dungeons requires deliberate and careful gameplay rather than completing a speed run (mythic+);
---
CCing one or two mobs isn't difficult or interesting. High level M+ requires deliberate and careful planning, which packs to skip etc. 
---
&gt;4.	Talent Trees;
---
Everybody is going to use one of the three viable setups anyway. Retails talents allow for more creativity. 
---
&gt;5.	You set your own goals when you log on rather than feel forced to do daily quests, weekly quests, azurite farming, reputation grinding, and mythic+ completion for weekly chest;
---
At least retail has content besides dungeons and raids. 
---
&gt;6.	Professions are meaningful;
---
There are about as useful as they're in retail right now. There's some good crafted gear and enchants, potions and flasks are always needed. 
---
&gt;8.	No sharding;
---
Lmao 
---
&gt;9.	Terrain was immersive and travel time was relevant;
---
*I like to waste my time.* 
---
&gt;11.	Leveling up is meaningful and rewarding;
---
Sure, lol. 
---
&gt;12.	Meaningful racial abilities;
---
Just leads to an imbalance. 
---
&gt;13.	Strong class identity;
---
How so? 
---
&gt;14.	Hard-earned gear is not invalidated every “season”;
---
Sucks for players that join at a later date when nobody wants to raid the early raids anymore. I know in Classhit you're inclined to raid MC forever, but that's shit game design. 
---
&gt;15.	Many abilities are off the GCD;
---
Not that many. 
---
&gt;16.	Personal reputation matters;
---
Not really unless you were a huge ass. I don't remember a single name outside of my guild from vanilla. 
---
&gt;17.	Real danger while leveling with real consequences;
---
You die and have to run back to your corpse. Just like in retail. 
---
&gt;18.	The grind;
---
There's more things to grind in retail. 
---
&gt;19.	Hunter pets with different stats;
---
Just annoying. 
---
&gt;20.	Rare spawns that are actually rare;
---
Those exist in retail too. 
---
&gt;21.	Attunement quests;
---
Still exist. 
---
&gt;22.	Crafting recipes that are hard to get;
---
Still there. 
---
&gt;23.	Choices that are relevant;
---
What does that even mean? 
---
&gt;24.	Crafted gear that matters and is BIS;
---
Still there, there's no true BIS anymore. 
---
&gt;25.	Spell ranks;
---
Obnoxious. 
---
&gt;26.	No separate PvE and PvP gear and abilities;
---
No separate gear in retail. Are you even trying. 
---
&gt;27.	Stranglethorn Vale;
---
&gt;28.	Crowd control sometimes required;
---
It's required in M+ and some raid encounters. 
---
&gt;29.	The screams and cheering from my guild when a really cool epic dropped;
---
You're sad and lonely. 
---
&gt;30.	How happy we were for our guildmate when they got a really cool epic;
---
Why would you care? 
---
&gt;31.	No ilevels;
---
Not true. 
---
&gt;32.	Social grouping (quests, PvP, raids);
---
Still popular. 
---
&gt;33.	Slower pace;
---
Not a good thing. 
---
&gt;34.	Content I couldn’t clear that wasn’t simply a harder version of content I could clear;
---
The bosses might look different but there's little mechanical differences between MC and Aq40. 
---
&gt;35.	People and guilds I admired;
---
Lmao
---
Wasn't this the spell leeway added specifically in the patch notes?
---
It's very good blue stuff for PvP  but... it's blue stuff for PvP.
---
My point is that if you can't raid, it can be worth it but as raid content will be released and more and more people will get their hands on epic gear, it will be a bit lackluster considering that it's still quite an effort to get. Then for PvE, a few piece like the helm are quite good as pre-raid stuff but it's not the BiS either.
---
In my opinion rank 10 gear is something worth to get in the early phase of the game if you like to PvP and have enough time (for that stupid honor system) but if you have limited time and farming BG bore you, just forget it.
---
He doesn't because people like him love talking out their ass. I had 60fps and 50ping in 2005 when I played WoW and so did literally all my friends in highschool who played WoW. If you were an online gamer, you did not have dial-up in 2005, so bringing up all these charts and graphs talking about an entire country's internet is entirely pointless because we're talking about PC gamers in 2005.
---
&gt;To all who say "why start with Classic when you are new to mmo's?"
---
This is such a dumb thing to say anyways. WoW classic was the first MMO for MANY people. I would even go as far and say that most people who played it didn't play a MMO before.
---
Play however you like. Doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks.
---
Yes it's that bad.
---
I only agree with #1.
---
All the above but also remove seasons, decrease power creep, remove lfg and remove sharding and phasing
---
Depends on your build and all..
---
Rule of thumb is, if you're struggling with threat and won't be killed before healers can get casts off = get more offensive stats.
---
Hit cap is a must, Def cap is subjective, Crit is really good if you have flurry or shield slam. Stam is a really good all arounder = more damage taken -&gt; more rage -&gt; more threat ( this comes at a cost of healer mana ).
---
[That](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_strike?oldid=304809) is the site from October 31, 2006. That's one of the last revisions during vanilla. Do you see it mentioned on literally that site?
---
The only thing it says that would reduce crit would be 0.6% reduction against level 63 due to weaponskill. Not 3% like stated by blizzard. Those 0.6% will also be there in classic on top of the static 3% that's not mentioned anywhere.
---
I find myself enjoying Logitech 700s more than mmo mice because I can use it wirelessly which is so much more nicer (and it has enough bindable buttons).
---
dude play what you want, but I can justify it as it's not important to me. I like instant ghost wolf and improved lightning shield
---
That's because it's beta. A blue post announced the "accidentally" turned off auto-report for beta but it will be back in the game for launch.
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
You push rank 11 for the mount discount. The only pieces you want from the PvP set as ele/resto are shoulders, boots, gloves and legs for the stats. The +2% shock crit chancer set bonus and ghost wolf movement speed are just extra, not mandatory.
---
And obviously you replace the PvP shoulders with Deep Earth Spaulders. Just don't count on being able to get them early on since they're the most hotly contested ele shaman-specific item in MC.
---
Tip your mages for pressing 1 button a few times, and then drinking... wow 15 seconds of work...
---
Nah that's like someone saying tip every player who helps you kill a mob. Or tip your tanks/healers, actually tip your whole group. Like tipping your mages is the same mentality that now has tanks going "will take for all greens" or "all righteous orbs". Like you don't tip your garbage man for doing his job...
---
When a vending machine spits out your change you don't say "nah man you keep that, you earned it"
---
tye point is resto sucks open your eyes
---
Thank god because my graphics card from 2011 doesn’t either :D
---
No it isn't. You can do Winterspring at whatever pace you like, it just takes forever. R14 you *have* to stay consistent or you lose rank.
---
Pvp discount is rank 3, rank 11 is the pvp mounts.
---
With the way leeway is working, in pvp, there are only tauren warriors.
---
Lol funny, yea lightning shield is the greatest defense against rogues
---
What's wrong with Kargoz?
---
You're right, I mixed that up.
---
So brave
---
Pretty sure right click report was removed from latest stress tests, no?
---
Everything you said is a lie. Why do you even post here?
---
I didn't in vanilla. I had like 2 60s a 50something a few 40s and multiple 20/30s and 3 or 4 twinks. 
---
The majority of my time was spent not at 60. 
---
Not everyone plays the same.
---
I thought LFG and LFR were the most hated systems.
---
Vanilla didn't have a lot of things that made it to Classic. Layering is one of them.
---
Blizzard is not afraid of failure otherwise they wouldn't have launched Classic at all. After all why launch something that you are sure will fail? It doesn't make any sense from any perspective. Why let down the community again with a failure? Why invest 3 years of development if you know it's gonna fail?
---
Blizzard is however facing the reality that is tourism head on. And you seem to be delusional to think Vanilla is the best MMORPG ever created. Even among the WoW community TBC is regarded as the best.
---
&gt;They even call new potential players "tourists" rather than see them as an opportunity to gain a bigger audience for Classic..but to do that, they have to give them exactly that game, and they're not gonna do that apparently.
---
New potential players are tourists. It's not a derogatory term. And I'm not even sure someone from Blizz actually used that term. It's mostly a term used by the community.
---
And I would argue that layering has a lot more potential to bring in new players than queues and overcrowding. If someone new want's to try the game but can't even get in or can't even experience it past the first zone due to overcrowding how are they gonna like it?
---
&gt;This is gonna be a PR disaster of big proportions, and will lead to many of the core audience people leaving this company for good if they pull this off. 
---
It's all speculation at this point and you may be right or you may be wrong.
---
I hate this mentality, don't tip people for playing their class... you could spend less on food that doesn't disappear when you logout. It's a bad mentality that make people feel they must be rewarded for doing something nice.
---
You repeated several points multiple times.
---
&gt;Attunement quests;
---
I will never understand why some people think this is a plus. Attunement quests are shit.
---
don't worry, there will be a mod for that which will slowly become required if you want to do anything properly.
---
I had it forcefully pushed into my brain that D2 meant destiny 2 and I'm ashamed I didn't put any of that together.
---
Except that everything dies way easier than on pservers. So everything will be torn through like on the beta.
---
Blizzard said it was an accident and it will be back in the game for launch.
---
I use alt + C for char screen.
---
still doesn't make up for the fact that priests are the primary offensive dispell on alliance and the healing is done by the paladins. ive never experienced a shortage of offensive dispels as alliance.
---
I believe Mike Tyson is afraid of mythe.
---
Imma gonna main a Human mage once classic hits, gotta grind for that Big Blue Dress.
---
Change the philosophy. Get rid of hack'n'slash elements (like "tons of loot" , "instant action through lfg/rf" ) and bring back rpg elements.
---
You don't, you find a mage that doesn't feel entitled to your wallet...
---
But it's done quicker. It's also somewhat fun unlike the laborious WS grind.
---
I used to have a second alt account on which I'd had a lvl 60 rogue that id keep in stealth close by or following my main account while leveling. 
---
There was so many gankers, that would rage after I "counter gank" them with my alt rogue.
---
There's too much 'lost history' for anyone coming back to recapture the feeling of original wow.  You will always hear about stuff that happened during the time you didn't play.  I only missed MoP and I still heard/felt that through post expansions.  
---
Now that WoW is in 'Collectables Online' mode this is even more prominent.  They actually fucked up here and some of the old unique achievements broke and I got some free unobtainable mounts from 25 man achievements because I had the 10 man verison.
---
These are all just symptoms of a world that has been stacked on itself too many times to resemble anything but a jumbled mess.
---
WoW is starting to look like the post-login-screen of a Korean MMO, **'click this, check out this, hey over here, did you see this yet, heres what you missed, buy this sale'.**
---
&gt;and a yearly naxx pug which took out like 6 bosses.
---
TBC was out 7 months after Naxx was released..
---
Use the alert noise from metal gear solid or the noise the reapers make in mass effect
---
Any chance to find that powerpoint guide?   
---
I am searching for it but can't find it :-(
---
You can always get a new wife 🤰
---
They won't review every single report. They'll be a high threshold where they finally take a look, if at all.
---
They never said right-click reporting wasn't working as intended in the Classic Beta while it was available. And while it was available, it did not auto-squelch.
---
I'm not saying that the priest is brought for damage. I'm saying that due to this skill, in situations where there's no need for more healing, you can do it without compromising your ability to heal.
---
I also like the flexibility of doing what is currently the most useful thing in a certain situations.
---
I think there will be a lot of situations where someone who forms a group will just take what they can get instead of optimizing the composition. And if, for some reason, there's too many healers, it's nice to know that you can still make well-working groups.
---
I find that people on this sub seem to get offended by the tone of a comment/question rather than it's actual content. It's impossible to have a rational discussion when people get triggered after the first sentence of a 200 word post for example. I've also noticed that people immediately change the topic of the question to one they'd rather discuss as well which makes the problem worse. E.g. The question "Can druids tank?" results in numerous responses telling you why warriors are the best tanks often without any reference to the question you asked. People on this sub just want an opportunity to circle jerk each other over their classic wow knowledge. Responding to a question with obnoxious elitism is the easiest way to achieve this..
---
No chance of considering Alliance?
---
Not to frighten you, but is 11 or even 12 lvls for players
---
That is not the spell queue i'm talking about. What was added in 2.3 is, that cast request can be sent to the server, even if the cast isn't finished client side. 
---
Now in cataclysm client side queueing was added.
---
Video of xaryu explaining this.
---
https://youtu.be/9DqILmlzOSQ
---
Same. I’m planning routes for leveling or skilling professions. Feels like dryhumping...
---
The 2-set bonus is pretty powerful, so equipping two out of the Shoulder, Leg, Feet, or Chest pieces is great for both Fury DPS and Tanking pretty much until you have all the BWL stage replacements available.
---
Hey mate, thanks for listening to the show. I have tried to reach out to Kungen a couple of times on Twitter but haven’t got a reply, I don’t think he’s particularly interested in doing any podcasts unfortunately, which I understand, but would have loved to chat with him :(
---
For sure, but my inner neck beard tells me not to
---
It shouldn't be a legal problem. They give you the option to use it without a product key. It's not like the old days where microsoft would almost brick your system after 30 days, IIRC.  
---
But you're right, it's always advised to activate your software. Winrar is the only exception :P
---
Are you saying that the right-click report button was there the entire time during beta? If so it means they definitely implied that automated punishments will be in the game on launch.
---
Gnomes taller than dwarves. Git out.
---
&gt;  but there’s tons of people who enjoy Retail. 
---
Well, they didn't played Classic yet...
---
I can bet solid cash that Retail players will move in droves to Classic, simply because, while it's a different game...IT IS AN MMORPG.
---
Which Retail is not.
---
There are many differences between Classic and Retail, but the MAJOR ones, that appeal the MMORPG players, are ALL in Classic.
---
People say that there will be an overlap of the player bases...I say it is going to be a migration from Retail to Classic.
---
By the end of this year, it will be crystal clear which one is going to be : overlap or migration.
---
Pretty much. I think catch up raids were great in the past and a way better system than what we have now IMO.
---
Server transfer will be possible in classic. Next.
---
To be fair Cairne lifts daily a 500kgish log on his back just because he can. I can't even imagine his core strengh and lower body full power.
---
I don't like sand...
---
was somehow hoping this would be better in classic with a more mature population of people, but maybe I'm wrong...
---
No it won't. Next.
---
Bind S to a spell. You shouldn’t ever be back pedaling anyway.
---
"There are only X Scarab Lords." ... I can see your point.
---
This could literally ruin the game.
---
basically throw away everything that isn't vanilla wow or BC maybe some lich king
---
I remember having a warlock mentor in vanilla. I'm not exactly sure how I met him, but it might just be because his full tier 2 set looked cool.
---
Wrong place. This is for PVE servers.
---
I'm saying that right-click reporting was in the Beta until recently and it did nothing but send a quick message off to Blizzard with no response ever.
---
It did not once disconnect or squelch a player, even with 100+ reports from people that had never reported them before.
---
So again, you have no word from Blizzard and no evidence that auto-squelch or any other automated punishment will be in Classic.
---
PVE bad ~50-60% of pure dps (warrior, mage, rogue)
---
PvP worse - can one shot stuff if lucky and or decked out.  Most of the time prepare to lose to everything and be just hardly useful in BGS. Some people rate them higher, in 1v1 they can win, but over all in BG even if they do win they will be more oom than shadow priest. 
---
The Side note - While in PvE their dps is clearly low (one of the lowest of all hybrids.) They are a *Shaman* and if you only have 5 resto shamans in a raid taking a 6th, or even a 7th, shaman that is enh is little to no bit dps loss (as long as the raid doesn't have like 2-3 full groups of other dps hybrids.) Your totems alone buff your party enough to make up for most or all of your lower dps.  
---
The only issue with this is a lot and i mean A LOT of people don't know this because math is hard. And i think they hate the idea that any hybrid dps could actually be useful to the raid (save one shadow priest, which a long with warlocks are arguably worse dps over all). Otherwise stated, you gain far more damage running only 2-3 locks and skipping the Spriest and picking up 2-4 more pure dps (warrior, rogue, mage), than you do trading a 6-7th resto shaman for pure dps. Its not even close. But people take no issue running a spriest and 4-6 locks.
---
Depending on your raid itemization (Your tanks threat and dps threat, no thunderfury etc.) and (maybe with the new crit changes melee with have less threat) but on pservers anyway if you totem twist WF and traq air you can add like ~25-30% damage per warrior in group (20% ). Even if you did only 25% of their damage you would still be doing a lot more total damage than a single warrior without a shaman. But you might not always hit this as the Tanks maybe doing well on threat, one of your warrior party members may die, etc.
---
Its viable you just have to sell it to a guide without 6-7 resto shamans. Oh btw this is why, on horde at least, resto shamans are the best healing class (not due to their healing ability but buffing ability... too bad in pvp they largely dps [ele/resto is a really good pvp spec].)
---
The fun police is here to squelch you.
---
It might on pathwerk or loatheb when they're oom at 90%
---
Haha thats exactly how I felt I did try to ask how come it was removed when there is about 10 other memes in the hot list almost the same but he muted me! :P
---
How about we just restrict flying mounts on pvp realms and stop punish pve players for a game mode we dont use? Or better yet just disable flying when warmed is on. Problem solved.
---
Hes just not thinking for the future
---
If you play it right you could have a partner to play with, your kid as a cheerleader in a few years and later farmhand.
---
Or its perhaps possible she get a high paying job and you take care of your child for most days
---
Its time you spend now to ensure you have time once aq40 arrives to farm for the war effort. 
---
If your kid makes it big and becomes rich you'll  have ample time in later years to play wow classic
---
OK, i stand corrected on the updates part.  
---
My bad, we learn new thing everyday.
---
As an SysAdmin i dont see a legit reason why you are still running Windows 7.  
---
its ancient, and newer hardware sometimes doesnt even support Windows 7 anymore.  
---
Security wise its bette rto leave Windows 7 as soon as possible.
---
You must have some real good reasoning such as legacy software, to still run Windows 7.  
---
Even the enterprise organisations i've worked ( and still workf for) al already upgraded to W10.
---
Only goverment insitutions are most likely to still have Windows 7, because they are incompetent.  
---
Claiming I dont have know anything about a certain topic is plain wrong.  
---
I was not aware that a nearly legacy OS, was still receiving updates. ( because mostly goverment institutions are begging and paying M$ to support it longer)
---
I've been migrating systems along time ago to W10, when Windows 7 was already considered obsolete and it felt legacy
---
&gt; It also didn't mean that we wouldn't have appreciated constructive advice and well-meant guidance.
---
being told to read the quest is constructive advice and well-meant guidance, and will assist people greatly in the game.
---
But here are no examples for contributing outside the raid. We want to encourage that to help the guild with both nicer culture and materials for helping the guild to progress in raids.
---
At every single point.
---
Use the search bar
---
In Retail, if you receive enough reports, you're disconnected from the game and when you log back in, you can't chat in public channels for a set amount of time. There are some restrictions to how it works and it has never once worked in the Beta. OP is talking out of his ass.
---
Maybe put that video on youtube if it's something that's fit for sharing? Sounds like a truly remarkable experience. I wish I was there :)
---
If Blizzard was actually planning on changing the system you'd think they'd come out and say it by now. Instead their only word is that right-click reporting will "be back" in launch.
---
Most bosses in Vanilla had 3k armor. On private servers all bosses have closes to 5k armor to curb the melee dps. And private servers do other trickery to nerf melee dps. Like I said, melee dps is going to be completely out of control in Classic.
---
Yikes
---
Is it really in a drought or have Guilds that are recruiting mostly filled up?
---
This. The only "assholery" I see is coming from holier-than-thou virtue signalers like OP.
---
Its not an awful idea, but its sub-optimal. Yes, there are tauren only quests that you will miss (and some of them are "quest chains" as well). Plus you will have to run all the way there in the first place.
---
Basically only do it if you really dont want to do durotar for some reason.
---
This is really Bullshit you know.
---
Yes "be back", as in working how it worked in the Beta before, which did not have automated punishments attached. Your assumptions are baseless.
---
Guild advertising goes into LFG monday sticky thread :p
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all
---
Most all classes have threat issues, its often a dps restricting factor.  Locks and warriors seem very prone to this.
---
I'd just add a few things to your list:
---
- 10) No scalable content as in Heroic or Mythic dungeons or raids.
---
- 11) No "titanforged" or other heavy rng itemization.
---
- 12) Make professions relevant again (or even more so).
---
- 13) No "Azure crystals" or other needed currencies to upgrade specific pieces of gear.
---
As others have said, I think retail is too far gone but it will be very interesting to see in which way they take classic.
---
Wasn't Beta mainly full of streamers?
---
Lol
---
Me and a friend looked into the grind and saw that it would take us at least 350 hours of grinding (if we were extremely efficient) to obtain the mount.
---
It's not just things like scarab lord. There's tons of cosmetic and even useful shit in the game that you just cant get anymore, whether it has an achievement attached or not.
---
No, No. I plan to level in Teldrasil as a Human because of lower population at release. It will take me about 45mins of running but I also will be about 25% short of level 3 then without killing any mob.
---
Just thinking about it being lower pop on launch night.
---
It's not an expansion, we're talking about classic wow.
---
See, he is a speed runner, though. He’s just not in competition for world first
---
Do you just make shit up because you don't like streamers?
---
Yes. I believe so. They even said something along these lines in interviews. Layering is an additional, complementary tool for population control specifically designed to alleviate the massive influx of people in the the first few weeks but it was never meant to replace the traditional control tools.
---
You realize those are the main 2 without threat drops? That's why they have problems!
---
Wow. Classic r/youpostonthedonald 
---
Also, what kind of loser reads someone else's post history for hours ? And then lectures them about it? Fucking weirdo.
---
You had achievements, people could see them on your character plain as day.
---
False, but you can believe whatever you want. People do not farm LBRS, it's a place people run for the Onyxia attunement and then NEVER fucking return.
---
There were not many Arcanite Reaper plans in circulation in vanilla and there won't be now either because most people can not be arsed to farm LBRS, it's one of the most cancerous instances.
---
Bind your mount to a key. Trust me, you'll never look back.
---
You make great points; however, what killed expansions for me was ultimately the lore: the redesigning of entire races to make horde/alliance balanced plus the idea that every new expansion would just turn a WC3 character into a raid boss ruined my immersion irreparably.
---
I still don't think their solution is going to be to make retail more like Classic when the people who love Classic are going to be playing that anyway. The stuff that's fucked up in BFA seems to have little to do with that, more, they've just fucked it up in general.
---
I think player fatigue is *really* setting in now, too. I know it's purely anecdotal but *no-one* I've known at any point in WoW's life has played more than a week or two of BFA, and some of these people raided throughout WOD.
---
I can link the video when I get home. Its attached to his YouTube video of each class guide
---
I like this response!
---
Does it count if other people help you? That seems like cheating
---
This is some next level stuff. Definitely going to do that.
---
It's not going to be exactly achievements but there is always just plain old screenshots. I'm relatively certain someone has made an addon to take a screenshot every time you level up. I dunno how possible it is but I wouldn't be surprised at all should someone make one to automate taking screenshots at important milestones. Downing Onyxia, Ragnaros. Clearing instances. When you're all geared up in purples. If and when you want to track your progress. I like the notifications but well, should someone make that addon, I'll install it instantly.
---
Those people will be ridiculed mercilessly. Having a system built-in to the game sort of negates it by making it an "official" thing.
---
Just steal mankrik's wife bro
---
And on the same token, new people should do a bit of research before blindly defending layering because they think it will alleviate crowding in beginner zones.
---
me too. Already did several testruns on pservers and could do all quests
---
It was my first MMO! Started in november of 2005.
---
Also the correct answer to that question is "Because its fucking good"
---
My pleasure! Hopefully it gives you some insight into what you would like to play. Either of those choices are top tier.
---
&gt; substantially more
---
&gt;Alliance druid did 10% more
---
&gt;Horde druid did the same threat
---
And this is with 100% pummeler spam lmfao, as well as being a pserver where druid forms do more damage than they do on classic beta (and the boss doesn't have the parry buff). Also, DFT, execution bracers, Mark of cthun on a feral haha, that is never going to happen in any decent guild.
---
This comment is literally a waste of internet particles.
---
Nothing is wrong with him but a lot of his videos are older and haven't been updated with after classic wow testing. They are a great jumping off point but they each have some inaccuracies. Which makes sense since he isn't talking about his main class like most youtubers. He did a almost a full hour video on every class. The breadth of his scope means he won't be as in depth as he could be with more focus.
---
Works for me i will hopefully be able to scoop the pattern asap then. LHH would be Phase 2 then correct?
---
1. Ok  
---
2. Agreed  
---
3. Spoken like an LFR hero. High m+ takes many hours of training and preparing, strategizing etc. Just because it has timer next to it doesn't mean its a mindless speed run.  
---
4. Shitty mini game with no choices  
---
5. You are not forced to do anything. You're making shit up.  
---
That's like saying you are forced to complete raid in classic.  
---
6. Define meaningful. Because they do the same thing almost in BFA. Only "meaningful" profession is engineering.   
---
7. Ok  
---
8. Agreed 
---
9. Yea im sure flat terrain with nothingness is very immersive. Auto running is not good gameplay.  
---
10. Level scaling is great. You are free to go where you want rather than being forced into specific zones.  
---
You complained about forced activity earlier on. Hypocrite much?  
---
11. Nah, it just takes longer.  
---
12. Racial abilities are almost the same today. Do you even know what you're talking about? Or you love being forced into certain races. Again with hypocrisy?  
---
13. Plenty of it in retail as well  
---
14. You're right. Most of it invalidated every second "season" tho.  
---
15. Huh? meme point? way more stuff is on gcd in classic than retail  
---
16. Meme. Most of notorious ninjas just went into hiding and repeated the deed. Very few people took notice of who did what  
---
17. Sure  
---
18. Plenty of grind to do in retail as well. I dont see how this is a good point tho. 
---
19. Yea so you're forced to take specific ones. Hypocrite again?  
---
20. Sure  
---
21. Sure  
---
22. Define "hard". You probably mean grind, aka time investment not hard  
---
23. Yea, take either option A which is stronger or option B which is weaker. So many choices  
---
24. Sure  
---
25. How is this good? Its not.  
---
26. Agreed  
---
27. Enjoy while it lasts for couple of months  
---
28. Same in retail  
---
29. Happens in retail as well, just need it to titanforge. Same odds   
---
30. Ok  
---
31. There are ilvls. Just that they don't matter as much because gear is "unbalanced" or rather all over the place with its stats  
---
But dont worry someone will create "gearscore" so they dont have to inspect every person  
---
32. Ok  
---
33. To each to their own.  
---
34. Ok  
---
35. You can do the same in retail, you know?   
---
36. Same can happen  
---
37. Sure  
---
Overall I give you C- for this.    
---
You were right on for some stuff but very hypocritical overall and clueless when it comes to modern WoW because you're probably an LFR hero, if you even played it or just copy pasted meme answers that other classicultists spread around.
---
Pretty sure 4 pallies can hit all of the buffs no? 
---
Tank: BoM, BoK, BoL, BoSanc, (unless you are thinking BoSac, I guess you could use this every 30s on a single tank not a bad idea.)
---
Caster/Healers: BoW, BoK, BoSalv
---
Melee dps: BoM, BoK, BoSalv
---
Hybrid: BoW, BoM, BoK, BoSalv (Honestly, often Salv or might could be dropped as their dps is already low and you should have a ton of these anyway.)
---
You really could get away with just 3 paladins. Now they heal well enough that a 4th hurts nothing. But BoSanc itself isn't required, pservers have been using no shield fury warriors to tank to TAKE more damage for more threat, while this may not play out like this its still somewhat true.
---
What am i missing?
---
Orc zone is going to have about 2.5x the amount of people as the Tauren one. It takes like 10-15 minutes to run there and you can get some exploration XP and flight paths en route.
---
In fact, I don't know why I'm promoting this, I want less people to do it because it's such a good idea.
---
DON'T MAKE ME GET MY MAIN
---
&gt;taladril
---
Hahaha.
---
Also, ask for CC from the dps in your group. Fewer targets to keep agro from.
---
Demo doesn't do any apreciable threat in classic wow.
---
People who tell you otherwise are private server mememers.
---
Sure if no one has touched the mobs at all and only body pulled, doing demo will pull them to you because applying a new debuff does incur some minor threat.  However spamming demo will not create any real aoe threat in classic.
---
No but Blizzard is catering to them and their are reports that they will be exempt from auto-report punishments.
---
I did a test run of this and I remember **one** tauren only quest though it probably lead into a chain also.
---
Na you just log on your warlock and facetank all their damage with soul link + Master demonologist (40% total damage reduction) and lifedrain lol
---
Ignore this person. They dont know what they are talking about.
---
What is the one you’re leaning towards in terms of being able to excel with less gear?
---
37 reasons I can't wait for classic wow? Aka "what doesn't exist in modern wow".
---
For a hunter, rogue or druid make sure you grab.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9624/triprunner-dungarees from Gnomer. It's a quest reward. 
---
Also from Gnomer https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9454/acidic-walkers which are great caster boots . Very high drop chance on these like 85%
---
Rings are always hard to find good ones. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6414/seal-of-sylvanas great Stam/str ring 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3739/skull-ring which is Stam/Int from Hillbrad.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6505/crescent-staff is BIS for casters for a while. WC quest reward.
---
It's just a joke or more specifically a type of joke. Gamer culture has really adopted it and changed its meaning which for good or bad its already happened so we are stuck with it for now.
---
I wish you were right but I'm almost 100% sure you are wrong. Imo, the vast majority of retail players will still prefer retail. I thought the same thing than you, then asked my guild how hyped everyone was for classic and the majority of the guild was like "Eh, doesn't seem like the game for me, too grindy and leveling is too important and there's no m+".
---
Granted, it's a small guild and a super small sample of people, but they're not retail fanboys or anything. They dislike a lot of the things that make retail shit, but also like a lot of the things that exist in retail and don't exist in Vanilla.
---
Again, I hope you're right tho.
---
Thanks for clarification. So all those rep quests where already in in Patch 1.0?
---
Wasn't aware of anni not beeing a thorium brooderhood item. Thanks again!
---
Why wouldnt you just use your PC? Seems like you should have also thrown in “just asking for a friend!”
---
Ah, you mean these ones :D  
---
Found them, thanks.
---
Mage one for example:

---
You're full of shit and spreading misinformation in this sub is against the rules.
---
Definitely, I didn't play wow back then but I am familiar with counter strike. If every server had 200-500 ping then there wouldn't have been many players left.
---
DELETE THIS
---
R u srz bru?
---
The fun is in the challenge of trying to make the spec work.
---
I started playing in WOTLK and currently 9/9M on retail. Classic is such a fucking mess that even I have trouble finding information. Sometimes old school players know the answer or have an even better answer than what google results can find. I haven't ran into any assholes except the assgold fan boys. I think assgold a toxic player and has created a toxic community around his stream.
---
Post this into the LFG reddit sticky post. Otherwise you are going to get downvoted to oblivion my dude.
---
&gt; To all who say "why start with Classic when you are new to mmo's?" 
---
.....Most of that player base was probably new to MMO's when it came out. It got millions of people interesting IN the MMORPG genre. That sentence "why start classic when new to mmo's" has to be the most poorly thought out sentences I have read on this sub lol
---
When you go further you reach westfall and ress in sentinels point.
---
Yeah idk man. It takes a lot to really piss me off in-game and make me say something. And, that is either A) someone is just doing something plain retarded, and I'll let them know. It's usually something on purpose. 
---
B) Degrading others in the group. I can't stand when people just shit on other people. 
---
To be honest though, it comes from the same toxic community that requires better gear than the content to run that raid/dungeon. People have outrageous requirements as soon as they get gear, and forget that they were once noobs trying to get geared, and did the *same* raid that they are requiring BiS gear for.
---
Yeah, I kind of preferred it when the lore characters took a back-seat to my adventure like they had their own important shit to do back in the capital cities, while I was out making my own adventure, honestly.
---
The fact that major lore characters now follow *us* around on our mounts really blows my immersion now, and makes me afraid for the franchise. WoD might have been cooler if your "Garrison" was a guild's garrison or something, and related to guild achievements... but giving every single one of WoW's millions of characters a base and calling them all commanders was ... a weird call to me.
---
Why would shamans not be allowed a chance at sulf? Its a pure toy.
---
So if retail's auto-report system goes in, do you think Blizzard is going to allow streamers to be constantly squelched?
---
The thing is, when I talk to people who've actually played vanilla, they all agree that historically, no-one went deep prot, ever. Main tanks were mostly deep arms for pvp with as few points in prot as they could get away with, around 17-20 or so.
---
Guilds did their best to force offtanks to put those same 17 points into protection, but people largely didn't do that. That caused a lot of conflict when the armory dropped and you could inspect talents cause wouldn't you know, your offtanks had better things to do with their talents than getting last stand.
---
So no, the idea that tanks were historically deep prot is pretty revisionist.
---
The only thing that's really different is not wearing a shield.
---
Warriors have always been the most picked class. Even when noone knew what their potential was.
---
There's two much simpler reasons for that:
---
1. It is the only class available to every single race
---
2. It really has this default-class-vibe to it
---
There is like one tauren only quest chain, when we did tauren+orc duo test run in there. Didnt make a big difference, rly.
---
I’m not worried about it
---
My takeaway from the OP is that if someone asks a "lazy" question there's no need to be rude or insulting.  Just downvote and move on.  If you want to be nice and give them an answer, great, but don't be rude.
---
Enhancement shaman is always fun with Winfury procs. Will do good damage just with a decent weapon.
---
I used to like achievements but many people in this thread make really good points: achive linking and not repeating tasks cause the achievement is done. I actually quit after completing specific achievements I wanted
---
I concur
---
I used to do this but I would finish the orc starting area first and then make the run at level 5-6. The run to Bloodhoof village takes about 14 minutes
---
Make sure you take the back exit out of the valley of Trials and go through Rachet. Get the FP for both Rachet and Xroads which will be very helpful later.
---
for PvP orc by a little bit, for PvE it depends - if you are a non-axe wielding tank Tauren is probably a tiny bit better.
---
Agreed
---
Even then, the original comms from blizz around layering were that your character should be tied back to their original layer, with the same people. 
---
Beta has shown some issues with the implementation though so Blizz really need to set the record straight on whether it's a bug or a change in design.
---
Excellent write-up, really appreciate it! I am going to stick with orc shaman for the totems/utility but I might roll a druid later on ;)
---
Is healing in PvP as shaman viable with deep resto builds or do I lose too much damage?
---
They jumped the shark with the story. It's too late for retail unless they wind back the clock and undue the damage done to the lore.
---
Ah ok, seems like you have it figured out then, gl :)
---
Returns :(
---
Are you sure about that? Gear score used to be an addon too.
---
Nice man. You'll make some serious money if you are (among) the first to get it on your server.
---
For reference the fee to get Titanium Leggings crafted was 300g during the first days on the private server that's not to be named.
---
Upvoted for mage tips
---
The cat is out of the bag, retail is not an MMO, it’s a multiplayer hack and slash.
---
Sure but I like to prepare (that´s why im here lol) and there is not so much to do in Phase 1. I expect to have MC clear in week 4 or 5. Then it will be one or two raids a week for some month until P3 hits.
---
Orc shaman! Great for both pve and pvp heals with all the utilities.
---
Playing feral drood ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If my memory serves me right ferals were good flagcarriers and thats about it. Playing a feral in PVE requires tons of effort such as farming [Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler)s.
---
Link us to the proof that streamers are exempt first
---
Well said!
---
We don't want classic to have a toxic community!
---
10 mins ? no fucking way. Ive tested this and if you want to get ratchet, crossroads and camp flypoints and get to the L1-5 area its going to take about 15-17 minutes. Thats with deaths on every possible place to cut running.
---
Just socially inept guys, I think.
---
Thank god I'm 27 this time around and much less affected by rude people on the internet.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if nobody ever reviewed the reports m. The button should just be a placebo for salty gamers
---
Times have changed, what was once considered a baby mmo is now 'hardcore'. It's a pretty topical question when retail wow exists, it's kinda funny you guys are acting shocked. If someone picked up Morrowind as their first Elder Scrolls game in 2019 I'd be asking some questions too
---
I want to roll orc but its putting me off as the zone will be heaving.
---
Its more like private servers estimated from old videos that most bosses are 5, then tuned up to 8 to compensate for inaccuracy. Meanwhile in classic some bosses are 3, some bosses are 5, and some bosses are 8.
---
And no one cared about it and mocked it for a whole expansion.
---
As for PVP heart of the wild feral into resto is one of the best WSG specs in the game it allows you to run flags like a maniac and be able to still tank up and heal like a monster in pvp. As for PVE Feral is not the best dps like lower of the pack levels, but as for tanking really good guilds will want to bring at least one bear to raids. They are one of the best off tank options you can use because it really allows you to full send gear between only two warriors vs having to shift it around awkwardly between three. The druid has very specific gearing so it is a clear choice on when they get gear over the main/ off tank because of this. They do fit a very niche role but they are incredibly useful in raids, and i think one of the best things to put into a tank group to help boost the threat levels of your main tanks. IF you have any other more specific questions please let me know so i can try and answer them about at least feral druid tanking after having done it on the private servers.
---
I love classic but I also hope they progress to BC eventually. That was my personal peak WoW.
---
Onyxia resets every 5 days and ZG/AQ20 every 3 days, the resets will be all over the place anyway.
---
This is at great post and a lot of these ideas I share as well. Especially the part about old world materials, I've been wanting them to do that for as long as I can remember.
---
Why is an Arcane Crystal or Elementium Ingot no longer useful? I don't get it. There's so much awesome stuff to make and find but only 1% of it is worth it/usefull.
---
For me it's playing the patch and not the expansion and playing the spec and not the class
---
That sounds like a great way to let that attitude thrive here. Ignoring a bad behavior generally fixes it :)
---
Does this work in TBC server? Also it's free yeah ?
---
Back in the day there wasn’t a ubiquitous 1 tank, 1 healer, 3 DPS requirement meta.  I remember distinctly running dire maul as a resto druid along side a holy priest very often.  We’d both DoT up mobs and healed the tank as needed.  He could mind control freely without fear of having to drop it to heal the tank.
---
5 mans are not so DPS intense that you need 3 pure DPS classes.
---
It’s not niche it’s the only thing you fucking press when more than 3 take damage.
---
The numbers were correct wrt toons in motion, female Tauren model and essentially everything. So, aside from using hb rather then leeway I don’t see that I confused anything. But thanks for commenting, Perhaps you could post the source link for anyone interested in looking
---
into this since it’s clearly fresh in your mind?
---
The leveling up one sounds so cool. I always forget to screenshot when I ding lmao.
---
Well, even if the quests aren't there in p1, you know what they entail and how much rep they give. You will be able to save up the stuff you need to immediately become exalted once p3 hits.
---
Will we be able to test this on the stress test server?
---
The extra range can help quite a bit too if you need to take agro on a mob running for your healers as a Tauren. Not just the hp.
---

---
Did you know they made new quests and daily quests you had to look for in the open world through exploration as they weren't on your map, that asked you to do some basic stuff without telling you where to find the said mobs on the map (things like "kill 25 murlocs" or "kill 5 elite nagas") ?
---
Did you also know they ended up reverting these changes  one or two weeks later because some players complained they couldn't find the things and it was a stupid design and so on ?
---
It's a shame they did it tho, but it should show you how a part of the retail playerbase welcome this kind of design.
---
Even if the quests are added in phase 3 we will know them beforehand so you can hoard the mats if you want.
---
Good luck.
---
Oh I was there i am just glad i had my 2.5 leggings and was a tank cause FUCK THAT! But if i was on the other side of the coin crafting them FUCK YES!
---
I use H for cHaracter screen. It also was already the Honor screen, I believe, so you can just open character and hit the Honor tab at the bottom.
---
I hate when people who were new were treated like shit for it and now they treat other new people like that because of a “rite of passage” type thing. Which is why I’m glad to see this thread do so well.
---
Retail is not about gear. Noone cares about gear, why would they? Gear gives you nothing.
---
People want to do things that feel like an investment. That's why people love farming mounts/transmog/unlocking allied races/unlocking flying mount. It's permanent, and, up until this point, not affected by catch up mechanics.
---
With catch up mechanics on gear, it will never feel like an investment. Ion said they "need to strike a balance" on catch up gear vs gear feeling like an investment. There is no balance. Either you have catch up mechanics, or gear feels like an investment. And that's the bottom line!
---
Usually storage can be replaced. What's your budget, goals for a laptop? And does it has to be a laptop? (there are all-in-one PCs, nettops etc.)
---
And you don’t know shit.
---
Tbh i was doing a rp radiochatstation every 2 weeks in barrens...ppl recognize my name years later even i have stoped it after 2 years...i loved it but i thinking that things like this dont work anymore
---
No one ever claimed that would be the case either.
---
Ok off tank in PVE, insane in world pvp IF (big fat hard if btw) played right or simply unkilable because you can just run away anyway, WSG MVP due to flag carrying potential,  great leveling, sub-par pve dps.
---
OOMKings are fun in the sense that IF they can land that 10sec cast starfire and it crits they 80%-0 someone I guess.
---
Hilarity will ensue when people make gear score for Classic and realize that all the scoring is all over the place on items so it's completely useless :D.
---
People on here can't find that thing I think. It's crazy the number of questions they could get answered by using the Google machine.
---
Aight, 17, whatever. Regardless, it's still going to be quicker than competing with 2-2.5x as many people in one zone.
---
For Windows you can download a program to rebind your Windows and capslock keys. Autohotkey is a good option and you can do a ton more with it.
---
&gt;Make gear actually unique and not just stats multiplied by ilvl.
---
Besides a few exceptions gear is just a stat stick in vanilla, too.
---
I started in classic, when it was the only choice. Why shouldn't someone new, begin at the beginning??? Makes sense to me.
---
You have no fucking idea what you are talking about, if you can't understand even 1-2 years in there will be constantly new players coming in, needing Arcanite Reapers and shit. You must have never played WoW. What an idiot.
---
Im that lvl 60 wearing a regal wizard hat while having a full tierset till nax because real wizzards wear pointy hats!!
---
Remove ilvl completely.
---
And we'll ridicule those people too. Be the change you want to see dude.
---
Goblin engi’s can’t use the world enlarger, which is nerfed in retail because of how good it was in AB/AV.
---
Fucking lmao
---
Probably more of a thing where they want to keep some of the mystery. When everything in the game is known, it starts to become boring and formulatic, less fun.
---
I agree with tha majority of this, and particularly love the idea for flying mounts. Very clever and it makes sense. I imagine it as the flight master getting your mount ready I.e equipping it with a saddle and prepping it for flight etc. Would be cool if they added a short animation to that effect. 
---
Ome thing I disagree with is encouraging high level players to farm in low level areas. While it's great to see people out in the world, there's nothing more frustrating than somebody one shotting your quest mobs.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill
---
The base chance for your attack to be parried by the mob:
---
If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10, your base parry rate is: 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)*.1%.
---
If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, your base parry rate will be much higher. Exact figures are not known, but base parry rates of Boss mobs (effectively level 73 when attacked by level 70 players) are estimated to be between 10-15%, and may vary from one Boss to the next.
---
That is definitely false gear score was highly popular and became basically a requirements as an addon.
---
You will likely get compatibility warning or won't be able to even run the game with 560Ti as it doesn't have full DX11 support. Retail client moans about GTX 570 but still allows to run: [https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/#14](https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/#14)
---
If upgrading, a basic AMD APU system would suffice (Ryzen 3 2200G or better).
---
Agreed, I had to use win10 corporate version that doesn't update just because win10 home is one of the worst OS I have ever dealt with.
---
Irgendwie stehe ich gerade neben mir. Ich könnte schwören in der offiziellen englischen Ankündigung stand anfangs drin es wird genau 1 PVP und 1 PVE realm geben. Anscheinend haben sie die Meldung aber geändert oder ich habe das ganze nur geträumt :/
---
Yeah I guess there is not so much to improve without skipping flightpaths or quests. Those running quest will be the easiest XP in the first hour to get. Also you don't want to die more then 2 times because you won't have money to repair and learn the level 2 skills. I die once for menehil skip, and once in the cave north of dolanaar.
---
It’s faster to turn with right click. As a side note, I don’t think healers have to face their target but I could be wrong there.
---
&gt; Reasons for high-level characters to go back to low-level zones... seeing a high-level character roll through a zone in order to have an edge on their own content. Either by buying items from the auction house farmed by low-level players for their consumables or whatever. High level characters in Westfall, farming magic dust. Low level characters having/selling items (like magic dust) that influence high level characters. Essence of Earth. Essence of Water. Stuff of meaning.
---
Probably one of the worst suggestions i've ever seen.
---
Well, unless you are like the first guy on the server and are SUPER optimized in your grinding. I suspect that blizzard will have some phasing/faster spawns ontop of the layering system for L1-5 zones. It all depends how "authentic" they want to go.
---
But yeah, if i end up doing orc/troll shaman over tauren, i will run to mulgore (with a warrior friend). But thats 100% because of TB reputation and getting a kodo.
---
I never made a value statement about the addon itself, only that people used and will use it.
---
Imagine posting a guide that tells you to NOT go darkshore 12-17.. smh
---
&gt; I wonder what else is different...
---
by different you mean different than a lot of pservers right? Since the blue post claims this is how it was.
---
Man, there has been of lot of "differences" discovered already, I really wonder if Warriors will hold up to the top tier DPS like on pservers
---
They said several times they review the reported posts. So someone reported a low effort meme.
---
Well actually I made the meme myself so I did do something when I put the text over the image :)
---
Hell Im using this opportunity to introduce people to the genre if anything. 
---
The game got me hooked all those years ago and its almost literally the same game. To consider it hardcore now instead of what it was because it IS what is was seems silly to me.
---
I don't think so
---
You don't need to know budget, i'm just asking for advice on which of those specs is best for Classic. Goals are to play Classic on my lap. Not for raiding or PVP.
---
I already have a 3kus$ gaming PC, i just need something cheap as chips for travel, lounge etc
---
If the mage is frost it's not so bad. Ele is bad because its lack of cc and casting push back. Lightning bolt is very efficient so if you can spam it without shocking it can be pretty effective.
---
Cause only sterling does it better than loggins!
---
I think resto is a better flag carrier than feral? basically for swiftmend and NS. and maybe swiftshifting and full nature's grasp, which e.g. 1/29/21 wouldn't have.
---
Ferals are great tanks. Maybe not in certain raid fights, but certainly in dungeons, and I think in most raid fights.
---
The dps is really bad. Like half what a rogue would do.
---
They're great for soloing elite stuff or dungeons, or grinding.
---
Great for exploring (stealth, travel forms, etc), of course.
---
Itemization for ferals is lacking, which can be frustrating. The pvp gear is good for ferals if you want to spend a lot of time doing that.
---
Great for world pvp.
---
I thought it's fun to play as a hybrid in pvp, mostly fighting but throwing clutch heals when needed. (It's probably better to play resto, but it's fun to do e.g. 1/29/21.)
---
Not even close to the funniest pvp battle in wow history.
---
Female Orc Warrior, that will stand out enough in general.
---
someone is going to be crazy enough to multibox 24 ults to 35
---
Or "Are we not doing phrasing?" lawl
---
Skarmtank on youtube. Check him out.
---
This is a wholesome comment and all, but wew lad this is a bad idea.
---
BGs are undoubtedly better on a single server. Anyone arguing otherwise either played on the larger population faction side of their server or simply didn't play before cross-realm BGs.
---
You lose a lot of incentive with cross-realm BGs and you will not know the people you fight against/with. 
---
Why not have server faction balance mechanics/info and allow larger server sizes? This would address the problem of imbalanced factions. Imbalanced factions causes more of a problem to a server than just long BG queues. It hurts world PVP and world boss encounters, so why not try to address this problem initially?
---
- No LFG
---
- No LFR (both ruin the sense of community that building a group encourages, you don't even remember people's names after 30 seconds)
---
- No dailies
---
- No world quest (basically, no chores)
---
- Meaningful goals: no looping M+ where you gear up to do higher M+ to gear up to etc. No raid where you do normal to do heroic to do mythic to keep doing mythic to have warforge.
---
- Flying should not be grinded, it should be awarded for completing leveling and a good portion of the expansion content, but grinding mindlessly for it makes no fuckin sense and is just disgusting. You spend so much time unlocking flying with WQ's that you then get burned out.
---
- Give more choice to the player. If my warchief is going stupidly berserk, I wanna change sides. Be it a relevant scenario where my decisions matter or a simple change of faction through in game choice, so I'm not constantly annoyed by everything that happens around me...
---
Might as well use the EVE online armor and hull warnings. Heh.
---
... Okay.
---
Arguable the most important aspect of the game,
---
Token Spriest
---
That would be my 2nd option. But with the 'albino tauren' theme. I.e. pick the white skin, the bald face with the red eyes, the small horns and no facial hair. That makes for quite the unique tauren look. Never seen anybody with this combination.
---
The *"private server experience values"* thing will simply increase how much extra mob grinding he had to do. But the leveling path will still be the same.
---
In other words: The mobs grinding sections would take longer to finish. But they are still the same.
---
And since this is a Leveling guide and not a Speedrun guide, that won't affect us. We are here for the optimized path.
---
Sounds like an explosion going off every 2s. Way too loud and way too frequent.
---
http://shieldhearth.ytmnd.com/
---
I look forward to all his critics' posts about their /played once classic launches.
---
repost is reposted.
---
Sorry then. You grabbed an image off frinkiac and wrote something that could have been in any subreddit and made sense. Your meme was just high enough to be posted. We should now tar and feather the mods and exile them to r/wow for their grave misdeeds.
---
I think its gonna be a more mature crowd
---
No one said it sells for 1k gold, holy shit you are so stupid. Arcanite Reaper plans were about 200-400g on every server in vanilla around AQ40 times. Just stop embarrassing yourself already. Fucking mongoloid mouthbreather.
---
Agree with the other suggestions here.  I'll add that for me to come back, I'd want a 'community server' where there was no group finder or LFR.  I think an mmo should be about needing other players, needing a guild, etc.  It's the only way I ever met anyone way way back, and I'm still friends with those people.
---
He said it on his last stream while he was doing the 35-40 segment, at around lvl 36 iirc
---
I envy the ones who get to play classic for the first time. They get to have that sense of wonder when they are running around in dun morogh or that awe struck feeling when they walk through the gates of ironforge for the first time. Everything is new. Enjoy it.
---
People rage on retail a lot more because they know they will never see you again, ever, in a random group.  I would say that in Classic, people are going to be a little more forgiving, hopefully.  From my experience, the world is generally small and you'll be seeing and remembering more people than you think.  Take notes.
---
Yeah he was kiting a warlock lmao.
---
I've been against it since we started talking about it (the blizzcon demo), but you should have seen how many people were for it. Just here the number of threads was enormous. No change is stupid but oh well.
---
&gt;I've never once heard the most popular internet meme of the past 6 months, the boomer/zoomer
---
Welcome to the internet, boomer.
---
I'm pretty sure the 5 second rule goes into effect when the channel is done.
---
Technically, making profit does make it not altruistic, so that may not be the best word.
---
Everquest peaked at 500k active subs, with about 3 million *lifetime* sales.
---
WoW vanilla peaked at well over 7 million active subs. (Then grew to 12+ in Cataclysm.)
---
WoW Vanilla's *active sub count*  dwarfed the numbers of EQ lifetime *sales*.
---
My only point is yes, WoW absolutely was the first MMO for many, even if you combine all the MMOs before it. Lineage similarly peaked at like 1/4th of WoW.
---
I approve of this message! The  1 tank, 1 healer, 3 DPS meta was indeed not so important, having the right amount of CC was of more value in those days since people did not need to clear the dungeon in the fastest way possible, the goal was being able to clear the dungeon at all! And from what I remember, most of the "hardest" pasrts of a dungeon were the trash mobs and thus having great CC was important.
---
Unless you intend on becoming a scepter bearer. Once the war effort starts, the only correct answer to "What am I going to today?" will be "Killing bugs. Where's my bugspray?"
---
The crappy actions described in the OP is the reason why people think WoW players and the community are toxic.  I can't tell you how many times I got this while trying to run dungeons in the dungeon finder or, God forbid, in the raid finder.  People seem to forget they were a noob at one time and didn't know how to do the fight either.  Sure you can watch youtube but that doesn't make you an expert the first time you run the content. 
---
Thanks, OP for an excellent PSA.
---
No one can really answer that. Official Classic servers or not: /played is heavily dependent on
---
1/ You Class (being a Hunter vs being a Warrior).
---
2/ Server Type (being farmed by lvl 60 undead, or being on PvE realm).
---
3/ Server Pop (having to fight over mobs).
---
Anyway, we waited 15 years for Classic. Don't just rush thou it :D
---
Oh your right I read it wrong. Every 15 runs on average you will make 1k gold so I guess that means robe of archmage goes for 600g in aq patch? Boy these prebis items sell for a lot. Your honestly delusional but in all seriousness if you manage to find a sucker that takes them for that I tip my hat to you.
---
As additional input my main is a frost mage. She and I will be lvling and grinding together as well as raiding focusing more on PvE content. Your thoughts are welcome.
---
Humans, the most dangerous game.
---
&gt;  "pray to RNGesus with a big 2Her" --&gt; That is exactly what enhancement shamans were to me in Vanilla. Loved it!
---
DAE boomers bad upvotes to the left
---
Altruism connotatively implies sacrifice. IMO.  I actually think the original word "noble" is fitting though.  Implies high moral character.
---
And how is that not a subset of idea or unit of culture?
---
Its that in and out mentality from group finder, its a great tool but it also has turned a lot of people into jerks that dont understand its an mmo and theres other people on the other side of the screen, so you shouldnt be such jerks.
---
I remember in legion i queued for a heroic halls of valor for a wq even tho i could solo it(prot warriors were op) for the free portal, dont remember the numbers but someone was doing low dps and was called out even tho we were doing great, so i had to be like "dude im doing double your dps and im the tank chill".
---
I mean not surprising if you pay attention while leveling ... you will crit lower level mobs more often, and when mobs are higher than you, you crit less often. The same would apply while raiding and fighting 61-63 levels. After all they are higher than you.  
---
This is why I know it is slower but if I am playing a slower leveling class I will focus on quests that are green to me. The time to kill those mobs is significantly faster, less down time, less likely to die.
---
Your meme is litterly about 50% of a subreddit almost killing them selfs because a game hasn't released yet but my post making fun of yours is the overreaction.
---
Your right though. You should continue to post low effort memes with  the classic symbol so when they don't get deleted it's the equivalent of an eye roll and head shake from the mods letting it stay. We're all looking forward to the masterpieces of content.
---
Battleshout seems to do less threat when applied to targets that already have the buff than when you buff them. I say seems because I haven't been able to confirm. What do you think about that?
---
Ive had my mount on Q for a while now. Totally a Time saver. I usually swap it out with healthstones during raids.
---
That's kind of a question that doesn't make any sense in classic.  Let me explain what I mean.  
---
In retail, in PvP and especially Arena, you are there to provide whatever you can to win the fight and damage is absolutely a part of that if you can spare the GCDs.  And that's really the commodity in short supply, the time it takes to cast spells.
---
In vanilla (classic), what you are jealously hording is mana.  Everything costs you dearly and the more modern way of contributing to the burst was less important than making sure you had enough mana as the fight continued.  I'm not saying you won't try to add damage where you can but in the case of a healer it might be going cat, wanding, or swapping to TUF with windfury and getting some mostly mana-neutral dps in.  But again with mana, compare how much time it would take to go oom as a healer in classic vs in retail.  It's not even a contest, hard-casting in classic even with lots of int gear and you are oom in handful of spells if you are trying.
---
In classic killing enemy players is easy, keeping them alive is much harder.  Your friends won't need your dps, they'll need health and utility.  So yeah, deep resto is exceptionally viable, and mana tide is just as powerful in PvP as it is in PvE.
---
You watch him recently?  He has a auto shot timer and players around it now.
---
They didn’t get to 1 million subs until mid 2005.
---
There was always a druid code when I played, you basically didn't mess with druids from the other faction and helped those on your side. Was cool

I've never played an MMO (aside from maybe Eve Online) where the economy mattered to this scale. I can't wait to grind my professions and sell the materials on the auction houses based on what my server needs.
---
In Vanilla we had a silencer add on that replaced the gun shot sound file with the sound of a silenced gun in a movie, it was a life saver.
---
I believe they were hoping for more than 100k my main point being is they didn’t break even 1 million in the first month.
---
6-8 months. So sure a matter of weeks but not a few weeks.
---
No problem man! Hope you find a solid EU Guild. Don't be afraid of those semi-hardcore boys though. Oh and check out classicraid.com I've seen a lot euies on there.
---
You have echoed what I have said all along. Faction imbalance affects a lot more then just BG queue times. It affects world PvP, world bosses, AH, and other stuff. The BG queues are a symptom of a larger problem and Xrealm BGs are not the right solution to this.
---
Blizzard needs to implement faction balancing mechanics and information for players in server selection. They also should allow for LARGE server sizes to keep the world full.
---
Ouch, Going to need some Aloe Vera for that burn.
---
Explain why
---
Spec is literally meaningless on level 15.
---
Almost is the key word :D
---
5.55-3 isn't 2.66. 5.55-5.2 isn't 0.33. Tauren druids don't have a larger hitbox in form. Nothing you said is correct mate.
---
Ah, I just noticed that 1 of the links went to Youtube and there it is stated. 3D 9H 30M.
---
Thanks anyway, I might use it. Looks good and easy to use.
---
Tipping is nice if you need something and someone offers assistance that tip is what helps pay it forward if you have a problem with it I’ll take my portals and food and water elsewhere good day.
---
I get it and obviously no one should be a raging asshole. Actually i'm pretty sure that would be against the rules so it goes without saying. But people get butt hurt over everything on this sub. People ask the same questions a ton of times here because they are too lazy to google it or even search the forum. For example just this morning i saw a post asking for the server list. Something that doesn't even exist yet and is easily googled. Just ignoring them is not an actual solution. Telling someone "hey don't be lazy, hit up google" is not toxic. Obviously actual toxicity (though rare on here) should be dealt with by reporting them. Its a simple as that. Report a comment if its toxic and the mods will remove them in a professional manner.
---
Im trying to figured out my class with a balance between aesthetics and "min-maxing"
---
Nah in 1.9 they removed negative spell pen and gave cos/Coe flat 10% DMG increase. Before the patch it was only spell pen.
---
TBH, I noticed that people here can't even accept other opinions other than their own. Your can downvote my comments, BUT U CANT DOWNVOTE DA TRUF
---
That seems oddly cumbersome to me. But once you've learned a certain way to do something all of the other ways are going to feel that way. 
---
I strafe with mouse buttons 4 and 5. I think I have a deathadder, so it's the two on the left side. 
---
For tanking and DPSing it works fine, your left hand still has unrestricted access to any abilities. Healer on the other hand is hindered since I can't whack a mole without my mouse.
---
Stun resist &gt; Everything else in PvP.
---
Lol don't listen to this guy. Kargoz is actively streaming and making videos on duo levelling guides of many classes along with in depth conversation of the strengths and weaknesses of the classes. Regardless if you plan to duo level or not I'd say Kargoz has some of the most well rounded knowledge of wow than any other streamer right now.
---
Skinning/herbalism will be the best bet.
---
I was quoting factual prices for them from vanilla, during AQ phase. No need to get all mentally retarded there mate, calm down, you can stop chimping out now.
---
New wow player here. Im totally ready to be flamed in random dungeons and not knowing all the basics of this damn game :D
---
This is asked all the time here - and you can probably find plenty of answers if you use the search function.   
---
Same goes for ret, boomkin, etc.   
---
I have played enhancement on Vanilla servers, it's pretty much like this:   
---
You won't get a raid spot unless you are IRL friends with the guild master - so all the nice epics you dream about will remain dreams and nothing else.  
---
You are really not good in PVP, unless your really out-gear people, or if you play more of a hybrid type shaman (swapping to shield / 1hander often, casting LBs, etc).   
---
You can get some decept pieces of gear with patience, since you won't get raid gear (get exalted with all PVP factions and rank up, despite not being welcome in premades).   
---
When you get a WF crit and one-shot a mage you don't care about any of the above.
---
I can explain so one of the most common usages literally means joke. So many many people use "I'm just memeing" as i'm joking or kidding around. How exactly does "I'm just using a unit of culture" make any sense. That is a curiosity with your theory.
---
Totally gonna start calling Boomkins "Hooters" now too lmfao this is Gold!
---
this is my bigger concert/fear comin into the classic release.  The "era" we live in now. A generation of selfishness.  Those who think they will relive the same experience as back in the day are all wrong...
---
And its sadly is going to maybe make me stop really early in my come back to classic.
---
Back in the day we were all new to the game, to this world, no endgame was even been done, an unknow world was awaiting all of us. So everyone was trying to help out eachother and guide everyone in their quest.  Questie wasnt a thing, no classic DB as we know it, thotbot was the only thing.
---
Now... the troll have invaded the internet and nobody cares about helping out people cause they know the can find the information on the internet. All the server will be filled by alot of "pro-player" and hardcore guild, and with all the data mine we have today, it wont take long that all these guild will ruin servers.
---
Back in the day Rag has stayed alive for months, now guild planning to kill him in the first week, can you imagine the impact on servers.  THis is not a  classic wow I want to live in... sorry.
---
&gt;I suspect if you're a white dude, you're not noticing it. There's plenty of racist and sexist stuff in this subreddit alone.
---
I notice it. I just don't think it's as prevalent as the media or Anita Sarkeesian would have us believe. Maybe I'll ask what my sister thinks who's a gamer too.
---
&gt;Just look at the backlash any time a main character isn't white, straight, and a guy.
---
Could you give some examples because the only ones I can think of were Battlefield 5, which is a WW2 video game. People were upset because having women breaks immersion, not because they're sexist. Or Witcher 3 when people complained there were no black people but the game takes place in medieval Europe.
---
That looks easier and simpler to understand. Not nearly as powerful, but some of the capability of autohotkey could get you banned due to its automation nature.
---
&gt;you will crit lower level mobs more often
---
I think you missed the boat on this one bud.  The point is that there is an additional reduced chance to crit of your gear+buffs on top of the baseline reduced chance that everyone is aware of.
---
That’s big if considering all the things that pservers guess on.
---
Amen!
---
From the sources I'm looiing at now it seems to be all about the mana expenditure so you are right.
---
If the channel goes longer than 5 seconds the normal spirit regen would continue once the channel is over though, I don't remember starshards duration but it's something to note!
---
Omg they were so bad. They could only one shot anyone if they had the right gear. They can get kited soooo easy, and all you would need is one hit to kill the person kiting. What a bad class that could astronomically boost the dps of the melee in the raid you know what I mean. Who needs windfury to increase dps disgustingly? What a bad class, and it’s so bad that you could even tank with it early on and make getting groups easier as a triple role class. Any class that is a really good support class stay clear away from, because you would be too much of a team player.
---
If we want Classic to be more than a pet project to appease us old timers, we gotta welcome the new folks. 
---
Not to mention there will be a learning curve for some of us old folks too. I haven’t played retail WoW since Warlords of Draenor and honestly I’ve been raising two kids in the meantime and forgot more than I remember about actually playing classic WoW.
---
Especially as a troll with the racial haste and the improved mana burn talent.
---
Link or no inv
---
Next
---
Yes! Though most charge so it's not really a tip anymore.
---
I think what the above poster is talking about are some misguided nuances. 
---
His rogue/Druid guide for example focuses quite a bit on front stabbing...something that is not possible at all. Same for warriors with /sit macros for proccing enrage/blood craze.  Same for paladins with reckoning procs etc. 
---
There’s just some definitely private server specific things for his leveling guides that may misguide some newer players. 
---
Most of his information is fairly solid though.
---
It’s TBC, why even mention vanilla? Have you even healed T5? CoE is OP
---
Man, it's gotta be frustrating to be spending hours upon hours testing all of this for Blizzard for free only for them to not even provide you with useful details.
---
For initial ApE threat, try Battle Shout. But, there’s rumors it won’t work in Classic. Not sure if it’s been tested.
---
Whatever man, it just comes off as hella bitter to lurk a subreddit for a game you dont like just to flame people for being excited and having a different opinion than you. But to each his own I guess.
---
Sub par is an understatement...  They usually get out dps by the tank
---
It was rarer. There wasn't as large of an emphasis on unhealthy gaming which is at the core of the issue. It wasn't a meme, or at least not as popular. Vanilla wow had a lot of casual players in its prime. Players that didn't know where the instance was, or a million other things.
---
Protip: if you want a healthy server/guild/community, BE NICE, HELPFUL, and UNDERSTANDING.
---
I'll probably play super casual this time around, not enough time nowadays.
---
Always use noggenfogger
---
If I show you a clip of a rogue gouging a mage from like 15 yards away in Vanilla will you relent?
---
Everyone was new once. I'll give new players a chance.
---
But if I give them advice and they choose not to listen, they can choose another group.
---
awesome, thanks for the link!  
---
from that it seems like its only 0,04% reduction per WS on parry aswell. I was afraid humans (and orcs) would be even more overpowered. seen ppl claim that 1 point WS = 0,6% reduction to parry.   
---
will be interesting watching the effect of this on the fury tanks. especially if some dps/offtank steps up infront and makes the boss parry a few extra swings aswell.
---
tell your wife you will be staying up all night to watch the baby. put baby next to pc
---
Do you have tactical Mastery? I always bow pull in dungeons, so that ~15 rage isn’t worth it compared to having a safe distance.
---
I must say, do with this what you will, the difference in abuse on RP realms vs regular realms is immense. Those on RP realms seem a lot more forgiving.
---
In Azeroth they do unless you setup the config to not show it :)
---
Thanks for the reply! I'll keep that in mind.
---
Haha true that
---
Nothing. Retail is over.
---
This is a great list.
---
Enhancement will almost definitely be faster. As enhancement you can psuedo-tank mobs for your mage to nuke. Your heals as enhancement will also be fine for leveling, and you will still be able to heal dungeons if you want.
---
However, if you want to play elemental, I don't think it would be *that* much slower, since you have access to a vending machine err... mage. You would just need to use your mana a little more sparingly, and when you are needed to use a lot of mana, your mage should be ready to switch to wanding. Then you shouldn't reach a point where you are both out of mana and drinking.
---
I think I you mean incomplete.
---
Mages should be grateful that I graced them with my presence. Tip your warlocks more.
---
It's quite the same (well it used to be before the tf bullshit.) I'm quite sure somebody will end up doing an add-on that looks up crit hit etc and give a score for it, and suddenly it'll be there.
---
I noticed this immediately when I reactivated in anticipation for classic. If I spec survival, I can't even use a bow? That's stupid.
---
Best one
---
Yeah. To your last point, all it would do is stunt low level progression unless the high level dude/dudette would be willing to partner up for questing with you.
---
The wow that definitely sounds true
---
The arthas stuff unlocks after sentinels campaign right? Been pondering where it is but I'm fairly far through it now so should be all up in stratholmes business soon if I'm right.
---
Those are the exact players that will ruin everyones experience.  Can know know what server so we can avoid all these hardcore no life retarded poeple?
---
Is there a website as avoidstreamers, but for hardcore no life retarded people?  
---
God... the game will never be what it was... Rag lasted month back in the day.  Now these private servers no life retards will invade us and destroy our game.
---
Its thursday, but my brain pretends its friday and stops working in preparation :/
---
i'll start remembering in phase 2

[Gkick is serious business](http://gkickseriousbusiness.ytmnd.com/)
---
Blizzard has to stop their replace/change/destroy everything "expansion" design to ever successfully make a "World of Warcraft" worth going back to, regardless of the changes needed mentioned in this thread for me personally. It's just nasty and wasteful to rob players of their favourite game constantly just to force everyone to only play the newest revision of "current content" full of gimmicks and change for the sake of change.
---
WoW design is destructively episodic, not expansive. That is point number one why I will never truly like retail. Everything you and I like regardless of what it is or in whatever expansion they will eventually change, replace, trivialise and/or remove on a whim more or less.
---
Whatever they make, even if it is fantastic for a while, they will outright destroy a year or so later and we're back to square one with no game to play.
---
You’re going straight the fuck to Thunderbluff.
---
Max zoom distance.
---
Auto loot
---
Instant quest text
---
Always rebind A and D to strafe left and strafe right which frees up Q and E for extra binds.
---
&gt; 10) No scalable content as in Heroic or Mythic dungeons or raids.
---
Do you think raids should be braindead easy or make them so that the later bosses are mythic level difficulty and most guilds can only kill first few bosses?
---
Gentlemen, gentlen let's all calm down here and remember what's important here, working together to kill Hogger before he takes over the world...of warcraft.
---
This is why horde has more drug users than alliance. You can meet shamans high on dmt you mention one drug on alliance other than booze they call ya junkie
---
&gt; My suggestion? Weekly quests. Make people feel like they're doing different stuff each day of the week, but still let them create familiar "routines" around their own schedules, so that if life happens they don't start associating guilt or being non-optimal with playing your game. 
---
Weekly tasks already exist in the form of:  M+ chest, M0 resets, Raid Resets, Island expiditions, Conquest Chest/Reset, ect.  
---
World quest emissaries are on a 3day cycle.  (If you don't log in for 3 days you don't miss anything).  They are the most efficient way to get reputation, azerite power, war resources, and gold for a casual player.
---
Also, when warfronts are active you have 5 days to complete them.  
---
Generally, I think the weekly system works well as it's not punishing to not log in every single day.  It's only punishing (to not log in) to those who want to be extreme about it and I think there should always be room for extreme behavior, in fact I don't like how these things are capped per day, instead there should be ways to endlessly farm/rep grind for those that are inclined to do so.  Allowing an endless grind puts less pressure on the player to perform the task on a daily or weekly basis and instead allows them to do it when they want.  This is a much better design, in my opinion.  Instead of logging in once a day and completing tasks and feeling like you're missing out if you can't log in, you can just farm for hours and hours when you do have time..  Say player one can play 10 hours per week and logs in for 2 hours 5 times a week, and player 2 can play 10 hours per week and can only log in once per week and plays all 10 hours at a time.  Player 2 is heavily punished and feels bad about not being able to log in more often.  Player 2 quits.  Eventually player 1 also quits because they feel like they are only playing the game to get the daily rewards which is boring.  
---
&gt; (Maybe provided buffs replacing and not stacking with expensive consumables?) 
---
These also exist.  There are relatively "expensive" consumables for bloodlust/heroism, int, stam, and ap buffs.  What this does however is makes it not necessary to bring the classes that provide those buffs.  Granted the classes do provide a slightly stronger version of these buffs all it does is makes the classes more replaceable and homogeneous.
---
The amount of insecurity in OP’s tone is a bit alarming over a video game...
---
I had a Troll Hunter on Antonidas named “Philcollins” and I would be in Barrens and every so often type “I can feel it...coming in the air tonight” in chat. Most of the time everyone else would finish the entire song :)
---
So....”Not all heroes show capes”
---
My biggest suggestion is to find a guild before the game launches. One who is fine with new players and you can find people to group with from there which will cut down on the elitism.
---
I tried to get into WoW pretty late in the game just to play with some friends who'd been playing for years. I was maybe 26 and an avid gamer, just not WoW. The passive aggressive ridicule and shade thrown my way by guild members and other players over just not knowing things ultimately led me to just drop the game.
---
Just to play devils advocate, what if you couldn’t link them? What if they were personal to the character only?
---
The **13-16** section of AllyRoute tells you to go to Westfall.
---
Westfall in this guide have no pre-required quests and won't unlock any quest-chains for other zones.
---
Players have the choice to ignore the **13-16 Westfall** chapter in AllyRoute and do their own thing (and go to Darkshore).
---
After that you pick up AllyRoute  again at **16-20 Loch Modan**.
---
It's really not that popular.
---
There was a gear score add l-on even back then and at later patches pugs required it. But those pug raid leaders used it as a criteria of bothering to inspect you before taking you, since 1)good gear can score very low and 2) you could artificial inflate your score, rendering the G.S. system obsolete.
---
This is the correct answer.  WoW does a great job of easing players into the game.  If she's sitting at the character creation screen and you're trying to discuss talent tree specs you're messing it up.  
---
Just a lot of praise "Wow honey you're doing great!"  "I can't believe you're doing so well!" will go a lot farther then over hyping and over explaining the game.

Lock box picking became (normal rate) x 2 for all mages.

It will be different on a server by server basis.

If you're demanding free ports, then you're really feeling entitled to the mage's wallet. They have to buy the portal reagents.
---
Win 10 pro keys eBay 5$.
---
I also put strafe on A and D. I feel like vanilla would have had a lot less keyboard turners if this was the default.
---
I was really lucky that I had a bunch of friend tagt played woe since classic and knew the game pretty well because of that... Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get almost a 1,8k m+ score in my first season (played since 2 moth when it ended) and I was so glad I picked this game up.... So much fun playing this with friends, but if I didn't had them it could have backfired pretty damn hard... So I support the "be more friendly" totally
---
Ive always wanted a guild of only druids to raid with.
---
&gt;Your expectations for recognizing names on a server with 2-3k active concurrent players, many of whom you'll see, are as likely to be satisfied as dissatisfied. 
---
You are correct, this is already a difficult thing to do, and often takes repeated run-ins with players.  That's why Layering is bad - it makes it significantly less likely you'll have repeated run-ins, since now you have to contend with the odds they're in the same layer as you 
---
&gt; Apparently everyone is fine with not being able to play with friends on the same server if it's because of queues, though
---
Well yeah... That's the most temporary of temporary problems.  Also, 100% avoidable by rolling on a low or medium pop server.
---
&gt;I seriously doubt very many people have a strong notion of "the correct amount of AH mats on Day 4 of WoW Classic" on any specific server or faction - it's a unique set of circumstances nobody has encountered before. 
---
If I see 10 world drop epic items of the same type on the AH, that would be odd.
---
&gt; Is it good or bad to find more buyers for your mats, allowing you to get your 40 mount a little faster
---
It's bad because I'm sharing the world with 3k people and AH with 10k.  It's immersion breaking and economically disruptive.  Why would finding stuff faster matter at all?  I don't care if the game is easier.
---
&gt; It's an imperfect solution to a big problem, but I appreciate their work to solve it.
---
IMO creates far more problems than it "solves"

I love milk in my cereal because it tastes better than water in my cereal :)
---
&gt;	not be an advantage against a mage that is playing properly because they can also be hit from further away negating the reach advantage
---
This is so fundamentally and unequivocally wrong. The meaningful combat here doesn’t occur at the max range that your argument depends on. It occurs at close range because of intercept and charge. Feel free to hop in any Mage’s stream and ask if they’d rather face a Tauren or an Orc Warrior. 
---
&gt;	So do you really think an advantage against a single class
---
I’m glad you said this, because it’s actually the argument against Orcs. They have a strict advantage against a single class: Rogues. The class that relies the heaviest on stuns. Which frankly, as a warrior, is the worst class to have an advantage against anyway. Any good Warrior playing properly should beat a Rogue. 
---
The bane of a Warrior’s existence is being kited. Stuns are just one of many ways to kite. The whole point of resisting those stuns is to fit in extra swings, and the Tauren hitbox gives you that more consistently. 75% more often to be exact. 
---
Haven’t even mentioned Warstomp yet either.
---
Also, you think Mages are the only class against which Tauren are strictly better which shows how little thought you’ve given this
---
I would only say that the Paladin Tier1/2 sets are good for PvP. +healing isnt HUGE in pvp compared to everything else and it isn't worth wearing cloth for a little extra healing most of the time. So I agree with everything else but I wouldn't say Pallies biggest con is itemization in PvP.
---
Look, it’s 2G if you want a portal.  You’re the one asking me.  Either cough it up or buzz off.  I’ve got price fixing to get back to.
---
Being a mage is a business, you don't tip them, you put up the price you are willing to pay when you ask them for something.  If you don't, 9/10 times you will be treated as a beggar.
---
How do i miss the boat every source of crit is reduced while fighting higher level mobs... its not rocket science.... you can extrapolate all this by playing the game... I don’t and most don’t need some post to tell us the obvious... 
---
Now if you want to grab your calculator and break it down go right ahead. I am not that concerned
---
Wut ಠ_ಠ now we're getting levels deep. Embrace the stereotype, at least ironically if not anything else. Denial in this case is absurd
---
Need a proper middle ground, back to classic trolling instead of being dismissive.
---
If someone asks where to train their pets, tell them BRM or if someone asks how to play, tell them to git gud.
---
Oh dude people are brutal when it comes to tanking, and is one of the main reasons in various MMOs that I haven't spent more time doing it. Even though I consider myself proficient, I'm not great, but people are assholes about it, constantly, instead of being helpful. Makes them feel all big, powerful, and important.
---
It's completely off topic, and weird.
---
This is an update to that thread. I’m the OP.
---
I get it. I'll support how ever I can with your denial
---
Finding old vanilla info is a bit hard since no one called it vanilla at the time, it was just wow or world of warcraft.
---
Youre right. Im looking forward to her face when I tell her: the day it’s your baby time, I’m gonna cover the night. Gonna take the small warchief to his throne.
---
I just got back into the game since like BC and was healing for that dungeon where you have to fly around with the dragons.
---
Well me and this other dude had no idea what to do and this one guy was just screaming at us to get on our dragons... I was like uh dude I've never played this before and we have no idea where the dragons are?
---
He just went off on how we are wasting time and shit, luckily the other group guys were like dude calm down and explained everything to us. They kicked the guy who was freaking out, was nice because everyone kind of bonded over that and started communicating/talking a lot more.
---
Ya Holy shit. Surprised it's been up for as long as it has.
---
Maybe your Bnet launcher is not updated? I'm from EU, have subscription, don't have beta access and about a week ago I noticed I have an option to dowload client.
---
This is exactly what I did and it’s working great!
---
Starshards Level 4, which I have casts 6 seconds and does 6 "ticks" of damage. The first two ticks only do 50ish damage, then two ticks of 77 damage, then two ticks of 103 damage.
---
So the DPS is only about 77. 
---
Smite-DPS would be about 120 but no Manaregen and a much worse DPM.
---
Wanding is 33 DPS.
---
Nope i checked that too. Its updated.
---
I have No problem explaining fights for new players but after 3 wipes where I tell him to NOT thunder clap since he aggro’s neutral mobs that tear me up.  I  told the group it’s him or me......
---
If I explain and the solder doesn’t follow the order the general are to be blamed.  If he repeats the order clearly to the soldiers and he still fails. The soldier are to be blamed and punished harshly.
---
I can't wait for all the noobs. I'm gonna make a mage and hang near starter zones. Hand out water, mage tables etc
---
#1 and #9 are contradictory. 
---
If they don't allow you to replace top tier raid gear somewhat early in a new expansion, the elitist assholes will just have an even easier time gearing up and being dicks about it. 
---
I don't know the answer to #1 - but I don't think there's a way to keep old endgame content relevant once its no longer endgame content without making it feel grindy and terrible. 
---
They need to stop jumping up so many item levels in each tier so things aren't completely worthless by the next raid or replaced by leveling greens in an expansion.
---
Download the client and use direct shortcut then!

&gt; remove sharding and phasing
---
I'm torn on this. I don't want it in most cases, but there were some high pop servers in classic that were unplayable because EVERYWHERE was crowded.  
---
I'd like to see it kept out of the game in all but the most extreme circumstances, but have it available for the worst cases.
---
It’s an armchair game dev statement that doesn’t work. Expansions are the best solution that exists but it frustrates some here in that what they do eventually gets invalidated, but it’s that or stagnation.
---
If titles, mounts and cosmetics actually meant anything that wouldn’t be the case. People still are impressed to see Death’s Demise, for example. Wanting gear and the like to still be excellent is bad design. I do think things like the Pandaria rare items from elites not being invalidated would be a good example of uniques that could persist for future expansions.
---
The other points are very valid though.
---
Ah, okay, now I understand what you meant! Sorry!
---
Yea, this thread started strong but then people who I can only assume plan on ninjaing with excuses like, "rules? what rules LOL?" to try and shut it down. 
---
I don't think anyone made a valid argument about group loot rules and breaking those rules. They just said, "that's stupid" basically.
---
The extra suppression coded into the game only comes in when fighting mobs +3 levels higher. 
---
The reason you see less crits while “paying attention” against mobs 1-2 levels higher while leveling is because you aren’t hitting them as often due to difference in weapon skill and defense (for mobs higher level=higher defense) meaning more misses/dodges/parries. Crit chance is the chance for a hit to be a crit, so less overall hits means less overall crits.

Watching new MMO players can be a really interesting experience.  When my now wife and I were first getting together she wanted to "be cool" and play the new Star Wars game that I was so excited about (The Old Republic)  so we buy her an account and get her set up on my old computer.

The things that happened were stuff I would have never seen coming.

I look over and she's not resting her fingers on the keys and gently pressing them like you would think.  She's hovering her hand over the WASD keys in some kind of deranged claw, poking down w/ a single finger to hit the button she wants.  
---
Her last game she played was Super Mario World and Sonic The Hedgehog.  This whole "3d" is reallllly hard for her to navigate.  
---
"Ok lets head this way"
---
"WHERE ARE YOU I DON'T SEE YOU"
---
"I'm about 5 feet behind you"
---
*Instead of just turning around, she walks backwards until she can see me*
---
It's... it's a trip man.  But she was trying and I love her for it.  
---
Fingers crossed she actually enjoys Classic.  I'm not really holding my breath she's going to stick w/ it... but you never know!
---
Thats the way I feel about this subreddit.  Snobby try hards that roll their eyes at anything besides w/m/r.
---
Thanks I appreciate it a lot for clearing that up. As I’m reading that I remembered there’s no cross realm BG so it all makes sense now. Cheers
---
&gt;Progress it through every expansion and leave standalone servers for each one so anyone can play any expansion anytime they pleased.
---
Just progress through Wrath and then reset it to Classic. 
---
Deathwing starts the Cataclysm and the Bronze Dragonflight just sends everyone back in time again.
---
&gt;  If the dps are not focusing on the same monster and everybody has aggro, say, I would get the monster that's attacking the healer first before worrying about the other ones.
---

I’m brand spankin new to WoW in general and have been playing for a month now (frost mage). I was very worried about people kicking me out of groups because I didn’t know how to play or run dungeons/raids but everyone I’ve encountered has been suuuper friendly and nice. I don’t play many games by myself but I absolutely love playing this game by myself and with randos since my friends guild I joined isn’t very active. I look forward to getting into classic!
---
There is actually nothing blizzard could do at this point to compel me to ever resub and play retail. The game is dead to players like me and short of literally scrapping everything and essentially making a new game, I would never.
---
Fortunately there is classic which was the one version of the game I did play/enjoy.
---
Yeah this sub is pretty toxic. Angry nerds mostly. 
---
I’m rolling Druid and if anyone tells me I can’t raid with them because of the pummeled I will just block them. I don’t have time in my life to deal with losers like that.
---
It's not about being PC, it's about being low-effort meme material. /shrug
---
&gt;a night elf Druid
---
what a surprise :D
---
Mages: stop making me thinking of re-rolling to your class every time I see you do anything
---
These normie memes are so cringe
---
It's like, I want to like him, but it feels like his videos are *heavily* warped by the metagame that has evolved in private servers over the years. 
---
Like, is it *really* necessary to go fury and not wear a shield in order to keep up with threat, if the entire raid isn't covered in world buffs? Could you even survive that way if you didn't have a 30% stam worldbuff of your own?
---
In the background visuals of his videos they are killing bosses in like 1 minute. I feel like he absolutely does know his stuff....but I also feel like "his stuff" isn't going to be the stuff of most raiders on classic. Does that make sense?
---
And I think that's the whole issue: rpg should not be a completionist game. You should not be in forced/invited in completing it.
---
This I agree with strongly.
---
As a mage I used to agree, as a Warrior: No.

No most bosses didn't have 3000 armor. It varied greatly depending on the boss. A low armored boss had 3000 armor

Because playing Classic will make you better at other MMOs. Your rotations aren't as complicated so you have to focus on positioning, mana management, and threat management. You need to think about your pulls in dungeons and also while just leveling up. A LOT of people are going to die in starting zones, which never happens in newer games.
---
Once you get past level 40 or so, you'll realize what people mean when they say that MMOs have gotten "easy". 
---
You may push a lot more buttons in a modern MMO, but Classic WoW is a lot more punishing when you do things wrong and forces you to be better at fundamentals.
---
I have two side buttons on my mouse. One is flipping camera backwards to check if you’re still being chased by gankers and the other one is auto walk.
---
Oh and don’t forget, your class silencer always on E.
---
I ... honestly prefer the bloat, and liked some of the ideas of dynamic spawning by zone over layering or phasing.
---
&gt; 5 mans are not so DPS intense that you need 3 pure DPS classes.
---
Bingo. I prefer PUGs with 1 tank, 2 pure DPS, and 2 heal/utility, just for the OH SHIT recovery factor.
---
That probably explains why I like shadow priest so much.
---
I recall when Xbox started their ridiculous achievements, and then I heard it was coming to WoW and rolled my eyes pretty hard.  Then I started getting them in Wrath and admitted it was cool.
---
However, it brings about an insidious method of play where addictive personalities start chasing achievements, and it also has the sinister portion of "no invite unless you like x achievement".  Which to me is just analogous to having an entry level position that requires 3 years of experience.
---
So not only is it bad because of no changes, but because of all of the tangential problems it promotes.
---
E. R. P. Moonguard or Argent Dawn.
---
But compared to the difficulty of raid encounters now raids never were had great progression. Naxx was the hardest and it'd now be considered a joke. It worked in vanilla as most people were really bad. If you did the same now it'd braindead easy.
---
An RPG is whatever type of game you want it to be. No one forces you to be a completionist, but there are plenty of us playing that way.
---
We could see fury spec tanks still, like 5/31/15, but they will likely be using a shield for that delicious uncrushable status via improved shield block, and won't be skipping all of their defensive gear in favor of hit and crit gear.
---
Don’t forget to bring a towel!
---
&gt; And no, not everyone should be able to compete all the raids and dungeons.
---
Unless you are saying that all raids except the last one should be braindead easy people wouldn't be able to clear a single raid as all of them had a progression of easy few bosses and mythic level last bosses.
---
You sounds like a DOTA player with ADHD
---
I personally prefer having some individual bosses with alternative loot for doing it "hard-modes" (using certain tactics, or beating it within a certain time, etc) rather than having different versions of the instances.
---
I'm 29 and i still do this :(
---
Finland, but yes legalizations have been very nice these last few years. At this rate we might have it legal here by 2030 ;)
---
We have no idea. Boss armor values weren't standardized. Private servers had info about the armor of a single boss and made their assumptions based on that. Since armor values were thematic I think it's safe to assume that Maexxna were one of the low armored ones, it doesn't make sense from a TP perspective for a spider to be one of the high armored ones.
---
Go raps!!!
---
Not in vanilla you don't.
---
You seem lovely and I admire your mindset of growth and respect
---
&gt;Were these underrated in classic?
---
Every other spec than Resto was underrated in vanilla and even then it was know druids couldn't be as great a healer as priests or pallies could.
---
&gt;When you saw a feral druid in a BG would you roll your eyes?
---
I rarely saw a full feral druid in BGs and if i did i would know he wasnt a good druid. A druids power is from using all their forms and mix in the strenghts from each of them to gain at advantage. 
---
&gt;Would feral be an o.k off-tank?
---
It's already been talked a lot about on this reddit and yes feral druids can off-tank fine. They just arent great as a main tank pick because they can't avoid being critted by a boss and thus its better to use a prot warrior. 
---
For off-tank jobs though a feral druid is perfectly fine.
---
&gt;World pvp?
---
Again, going 100% one form is to not play to the class strenght. If you asking if feral is the best choice or moonkin then the answer should be obvious as a feral druid has no spells to interupt and can open from stealth rogue like dmg skills.
---
&gt;Did boomkins outshine feral in any way?
---
If you buffed up, flasked up and otherwise got the best dmg gear on a moonkin, yes you can do big dmg numbers but outside of that, boomkins have not the best place in pvp, theyre simply too easy to shut down.
---
Of TBC. But it's pretty bad given they have to invent some arbitrary reason why you can't use it in each new set of content, every time they release new content.
---
Nostalgia. Looking forward to classic but the truth is it’ll never be the same, none of us are getting any younger!
---
Lmao nice
---
Yeah this can make great sense.  Get to Valley of trials (level 5 or 6) then do the run.  Or even skip the total noob area, and do a bit of razor hill (get to level 8-9) and then go to Camp Narache (Tauren equivalent to razor hill) and start doin the green stuff.
---
Correct. There is a little shack around halfway down Dun Morogh named Newman's Landing. South of that the zone updates to Westfall so you'll rez there.  
---
/u/Cleviprex I tried it once long ago. It took like 30 or 40 minutes just to get to that shack. The dark Fatigue waters are very close to the shoreline and it was a constant battle to find a safe water spot as you swim south.
---
People can be pissy and mad. But at the end of the day, Joana will FOREVER hold the world record for Vanilla WoW, forever. WoW Classic will have changes in it, which means that vanilla will never be perfectly replicated - which means Joana will forever hold the world record.
---
Your favorite streamer can probably do it faster on Classic, which is fine. But the Vanilla world record will forever be held by no other than Joana - till the end of time.
---
Get fucked, kiddies.
---
wtf?
---
Maybe have NEs go to Darkshore? Or Darkshore as an option.
---
Either way, looks good, thanks for this!
---
I like the idea behind not showing you where quest items are located, but I think this type of change would have to be done during the transition to a new expansion. It's a little jarring when some quests in the game tell you exactly where to go and others don't. It almost just feels like the quest helper is bugged or something.
---
Pretty sure grenades are incapacitates and orc racial doesn't effect them.
---
Yeah, it was to level with friends. Trouble was I liked Druid so I'd have to run to the Park in SW to train. It really slows you down.
---
Hooterkin
---
Just pointing out an error in the title, Joana's time was 2 hours 37 minutes faster than his 2006 to 40 run.
---
1 day 22 hours 5 minutes was his 2006 time.
---
&gt; without any new or additional content that they have effectively run out of things to do
---
They plan on rolling out phases of 'patches' and opening up new raids/content as the year goes on. Speculation that they will roll into TBC after the first year.
---
What’s wrong with dagger or mace rogues? WHATS WRONG WITH YOU OP?
---
Me not that kind of orc.
---
^
---
Just do WSG premades of only druids
---
Correct! You get to avoid that tunnel. That was a nice surprise. 
---
I always wondered why you rez so far south. First time I did this I was hoping to rez at the graveyard next to the IF gate since I was so far north.
---
F
---
Not all decisions have to be life-altering, and it was kind of a nice RP idea. Maybe they'll do something with it.
---
Flip a coin. If you are disappointed with the result, pick the other option.
---
Just not in vanilla, really. I wouldn't mind having a addon that emulated achievements as long as they were actually fun achievements focused on explorating niché parts of vanilla Azeroth, but I feel any such addons would probably have addons tied to raids which would result in "Link achiev or no invites"
---
Shooting some questions to compare Warrior and Rogue:
---
Would you say Rogue is easier/faster to learn and master than Warrior?
---
Rogue’s skill rotation is simpler than Warrior’s stance dance (PvE and PvP)?
---
Energy or Rage, which one is harder to manage?
---
Warrior has 2 roles (tank and dps), so double the effort?
---
Warrior requires more gear and micromanagement overall?
---
Which one is more “beginner-friendly”?
---
The bottom one should say "It releases next month"
---
Yeah if they took flying mounts i would unsub instantly. They showed us Argus and Nazjatar how to not design a zone. I cringe every time when i remember Argus, just no
---
This would only be a Meme build... Prot Pally Tank, Ret Pally, Disc Priest (DPS with Force of Will Talent + Power Infusion), Holy Priest (DPS with Holy Nova, Searing Light, and Guidance Talents), and Holy Pally Healer. 
---
This build would stack all Holy dmg with a Ret Pally running Sanctity Aura... so Lets call this build: **The Holy Crusade.**
---
Very true I made the same experience, but maybe the paywall will filter out some not some
---
I'm always the best of friends with a raid member who happens to play the same shit as me. I'll push a little harder to show them, next raid they pull ahead of me. Bit of banter about his damn luck and whatever I'm drinking tonight.
---
Grats to you! Hope you’re having a healthy child! I’m so excited because all of that.
---
I don’t know guys, this still sounds like your uncle that says, “advertising doesn’t effect me”.
---

---
Yeah, I think "Rogue / Mage / Priest" 3v3 players thinking arena is good, is generally the main cause of my issues with what's left of WoW's PvP community.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Grow up
---
I have to agree with that. Daily quests really are terrible for players and for the game. The only people who benefit from daily quests are executives and shareholders.
---
&gt;You cant manually select a target while strafing
---
Tab still works while strafing
---
They did, but not as much as the theory crafting elites believe today, and gear competition made them take quite a while to get there.  People's memory on these items is quite hazy today.  Which is fine by me, the P-Servers have bred a wow generation that sincerely believes no one else could compare to third vast knowledge.  It will be funny seeing so many of these players go "what the actual fuck" when they get into classic.  
---
Either way, game needs to hurry it's ass up.
---
This is exactly how I got my wife (gf at the time) hooked.  She watched me play for an hour on my laptop, then I asked her if she wanted to try it.  She spent about 30 minutes picking out the way she wanted her character to look, then logged in.
---
I let her play for a bit, then I left my laptop there overnight so she could keep playing.  The next day, I showed up at her place and she was already hooked.  She'd played for 4-6 hours the previous night and logged back in immediately after getting home from work.
---
We went out that night and bought her a copy of the game and a new video card for her PC.
---
I never tried to 'teach' her how to play, I just made myself available for any questions and let her figure it out on her own.
---
14 years later, we're still playing.
---
Vizzini! You told me to go back to the beginning!
---
Can confirm. I did not have beta access, but I could install the classic game client.
---
OP - on your battle.net client, right above the “play” button, there should be a drop down menu for which version you’d like to play. You can change it to Classic, then install.
---
When I left I picked up that one delivery quest to the Innkeeper at Dolanaar, but that was the only quest I completed. I hit Level 2 when i rezed in Coldridge Valley. 
---
Would be nice to level up a bit from this journey. Maybe explore Wetlands a bit more, Darkshore a bit. Take the boat to Dustwallow Marsh, get that FP. Going the traditional way through the Wetlands certainly gets a lot more xp from exploration.
---
Me2 btw. Havent subbed since one month after bfa launch and am able to download the classic launcher. Maybe it's due to me also having a test account on NA?
---
But gnome has no healers :/
---
The way you go about it is a lot different though. In retail I can quest 100% as I choose too and I can get around Azeroth so fast that I can pick the most optimal routes.
---
In classic you had to grind stuff out sometimes, just jumping continents to better zones wasn't the best option. Trying to run through high level zones to get to other zones was a lot more challenging and time consuming.
---
Quests are just so different now, even the 'grindy' quests to just kill mobs are not the same because the drop rates are extremely high.
---
In Classic you had multiple quests per level with drop rates in 5%, killing 50+ mobs to get quest items. In retail I can kill like 8 mobs and get 5 quest items, theirs no real 'grind'.
---
Yeah, it all changed based on who was buying what and when on certain days.
---
People LOVE paladin healers. Sure priests have more buttons. Paladins have 1 REALLY GOOD button.
---
just search the item and control f the item ID
---
I diagree with your solution to daily quests. Weekly quests are not as bad, but they are still bad.
---
I'm in the same spot.  Watching the calendar every single day for another 1.5 months is going to be painful.
---
Around 15% crit fury prot is more threat than deep prot with a shield. The no shield fury tank will not work vs bosses, but 1h with a shield fury prot is still really good once you are hit capped and +15% crit.
---
Hootkin!
---
We should have a drake meme with three levels of satisfaction like "bad, better, best" :')
---
For me character creation being closer is what makes me excited, I'm eager to pick the server and secure my name!
---
This wishful thinking was mostly in TBC, wanting to stealth run dungeons.
---
Thanks, not there for me though
---
I agree with that.
---
I agree with most of these points, though the reality is WoW is currently too far gone to completely revamp retail.
---
In reality Blizzard would somehow have to draw a line and start again from a new expansion working forward. However this presents challenges working with legacy features like achievements, pet/mount tabs etc which would cause a great deal of drama and fall-out.
---
&gt; I also had a dps set for when i wasn't needed to tank anything (i had an hybrid dps tank spec), my numbers were pretty descent especially considering i wasn't pure dps and didn't bother to farm mcp (most of the time i was about halfway on the dps list, sometimes got close to the top when the fight was favorable and i was tryharding a little specifically to make fun of the dps that were below me).
---
Did you use powershift or just normal rotation in raids?
---
I feel you on the MCP though, i know its a great item to boost your dps but farming that before every raid just is seems too hardcore for me.
---
Starshards actually would be pretty useless in that composition as it does arcane-damage instead of holy.
---
The spelldamage-bonus of the pala-seals is actually quite significant when you concentrate on casting smite.
---
Other than that I like the compositin. The weakest link would probably be the prot-paladin due to their mana-issues.
---
Omfg i hope people read this shit
---
My favorite thing will be when people get skinning and fail attempts - then ask if they are bugged :)
---
A lot of (Korean) SC pros lose their edge after their mandatory military service.  Some come back and do well, don't get me wrong, but a lot don't come back at all after their I believe 18 month enlistment.
---
It doesn't seem like a lot of lost time, but when you consider these guys train at the highest level for 10+ hours a day and compete in multiple tournaments a year, going a year and a half without really being able to play wreaks havoc on your ability to get back to the level you were at before.  And if you aren't doing well in the competitive circuit, you aren't going to be stay sponsored and make a living for very long.
---
&gt;Are the current implementations authentic to Vanilla
---
Impossible to know
---
&gt;How could the current implementation of either be modified to improve their behavior?
---
If it's inaccurate then you improve it by making it accurate
---
I would tweak it slightly-
---
Ret pally talents but wearing all +int gear, he is the healer (though holy priest will add a lot with holy nova)
---
Swap out holy pally for another holy priest, thus basically adding another DPS.  Ret pal DPS is marginal at best, they can just flash of light spam on the tank.  That + double holy nova will keep him alive no problem, and you still have shields or other cooldowns if trouble rears its ugly head
---
#FOR THE LIGHT
---
Feeling so unsatisfied!
---
"o sheeet, that's the sword that means that guy committed genocide for 3 months..."
---
Don't do this. Even if you don't backpedal, all you succeed in doing is removing functionality. Backpedaling is useful if you are a tank.
---
Having to run to the rear of SW each time you want to train is a pain. 
---
Not sure on unstuck.
---
WoW raiding veteran here with significant experience from Vanilla Beta Phase 2 up to Cata / Mists.
---
The folks who act like "Thrall's Gift to Azeroth" really need to get a grip and be humble. 
---
You know your class front to back, rotation down blind? Cool story Fam. Go learn another class. It'll make you significantly more effective in PvP and will allow you to truly help new players of other classes rather than just showing off how great you are and offering me constructive feedback.
---
I'm running into a lot of grizzled veterans, even some folks in my immediate circles, that think they have better memory then they do and really try to show off only to get G-checked cause they don't know what the hell they're talking about.
---
This game is huge. There's always more to learn. Many classes operate completely differently depending on their spec. Every spec can be effective in all content... Okay, that might be a stretch, but you get what I'm saying.
---
Could you link to that guide please?
---
Thanks. Yeah, healthy but stressing our nerves :-D
---
He is such a nice boy in the morning, afternoon and even at night (does not wake us when we all sleep at night), but the evenings... 3-5h non stop babysitting, carrying him through the apartment, singing, etc... not sooo much fun atm  ;)
---
"In a world where -everyone- is super ... nobody is."
---
The Virgin Lock vs the Chad Mage
---
I mean, yeah, hence why they do it. 
---
It's not like you really have anything meaningful to do in the zones by the time you unlock flying, it just makes travelling a bit easier.
---
I think the best alternative would be to cap flying speed at 150 if they were to be introduced again in 'Classic Plus', and only be able to mount in a city or in a certain radius of a flight master.
---
I agree, but I was just offering compromises.
---
Chest and legs. Shoulders will likely be truestrike.

Yes. I just downloaded it but there are no servers available.
---
Anyone know what this is for? A bug? i'm in europe.
---
Ah that is so true, in retail I do so many things 'later, not right now I'm leveling'. I can just go and drop 50K on AH mats to level up my professions I ignored. I can just wait until I get pathfinder to do all of the rares/treasures in the zones etc etc.
---
In Classic? Fuck I'm not wasting time running around anywhere, you gotta think ahead and be efficient.
---
I guess you can be more than happy that it’s only the evenings. Wishing you a good start in Classic!
---
This is the wrong subreddit, should be on whatever the retail subreddit is.
---
Might want to go back to retail there man, nothing wrong with enjoying the game you love but this is clearly not the sub for you.
---
Enh is OK through like, UBRS.  Totems are great, offtank potential is still very solid on adds that break towards the squishies, and DPS is fine.  The big disparity comes once classes really start to get preraid BIS or t1/t2 and you just barely scale at all with gear as enh, and run OOM super quick compared to other classes that have good sustain through either gear (tons of mp/5 for paladin for example) or talents (passive mana regen, etc)
---
Thanks.
---
why disable comments on the video lol?
---
Thats why i said manually, i should have said that you cant target a specific target while strafing. While with strafing on A and D you can.
---
This game was originally played on toasters, anything that is a microwave or higher should be fine.
---
Rogue is a bit easier to learn for beginners in my opinion. Energy is a way more reliable resource than rage in that you can almost always tell when you're going to gain how much of it. In PvE, both classes aren't particularly hard (that's the case for all of Vanilla, though), in PvP Rogue is a lot better solo and easier to feel good at. It's more complicated to play at a very high level, but it takes a long time to get there unless you're a gaming prodigy, which I assume you aren't if you're asking about easy classes. 
---
If you want the option that takes less effort to have fun with and excel at, take Rogue.
---
I dont understand this really. I have keyboard turn assigned to A and D because i always hold right mouse button. I am playing since tbc and i believe in the end of legion i realized that Q and A have function named strafe, cuz i always unbind them.
---
T5 is released together with T4 you retard
---
Danke, dir auch ;)
---
The complaints about spell batching are fueled by vods that show hunter trap and blizzard working strangely, neither of which have anything to do with batching
---
From a DPS point of view, 'good' DPS knew that threat is a PITA at the start of a pull.
---
In groups, I'd often suggest we focus down a single mob that the tank would completely ignore, giving him/her a chance to build threat on the other mobs in the pull.
---
That was usually easier than CC'ing everything.
---
Skull = kill it immediately.
---
Star = 2nd target for DPS (1st target for tank).
---
Not the best system, but it seemed to work 99% of the time and was easy for the DPS to understand, while being generous to the tank on giving them time to build rage.
---
If I see a person named Atheosuede I am going to corpse camp him until his guild comes down.  Then I am going to call my guild to corpse camp the shit out of these noob carebares.  Have fun paying for the GY res!

Then you always did it wrong :)

---
Agreed there, but I still think it's relevant to discuss given design philosophy, and for game designers to think about if they ever make a WoW2 or the next great MMO on a good IP.
---
There's actually a whole build around HF/Starshards which was created by a genius on mechanics well-known in the pserver scene.
---
I highly recommend reading her articles. There's a lot more to it than just "holyfire, starshards". But it's a build which abuses the FSR and the damage gained from Spiritual Guidance.
---
Not sure if I can link to pserver forums here, but you can google "Elune's Chosen" and it will pop up.
---
Yeah i am rolling a warrior to main tank for my guild so i get thunderfury.
---
I have spent numerous wasted hours discussing the actual base of warriors to the elitist pserver crowd here.  They believe their pserver experience and knowledge of mechanics is vastly superior to anyone who could have played/raided vanilla wow in today's world.  The issue with it is, they weren't in or have forgotten what it was actually like to be in a vanilla elite guild.  
---
You cannot help them, I have tried.  They are blind and deaf to anyone speaking other than the cultist chant of their brood.  Let them find out how differently the private servers were tuned and how much those little things actually change everything.
---
&gt; new to video games
---
Oh I agree. Having materials be meaningful from the get go and not just another stepping stone moving towards end game would make progression and utilization seem more meaningful. That's one thing I disliked about crafting in most games. Early game content, including crafting and materials was useless 10 levels later. At that point, why even have crafting?
---
facts, there’s a huge difference between a 39 warrior with a freaking pendulum of doom and a warrior with lumbering ogre axe or ravager. u already know if u get in range of the warrior with POD you’re gonna lose
---
Thanks, always happy to correct the memespecs.
---
&gt; Real rogues use swords. Daggers are for bitches.
---
Your no brother of mine.
---
Also, using poisons in raids is a noob mistake.
---
Its ok but not necessary by any means. You can still go backwards in a straight line without backpedaling, its just not that slow. Not sure if there really is an upside to be able to walk backwards slower. I do use it as a tank because of pwrsonal preference but i dont see it being any better than strafing backwards
---
Exactly.
---
People will watch his videos then blame their healers when they die.
---
Broken specs behave exactly as they did in 2006, this system does not
---
Not really. I was a guild leader during early cata, and at the start of each fight I would ask if anybody didn't know the fight or had any question on how to do it. It didn't matter if everybody in the raid already killed the boss, I would ask anyway. Losing 3 minutes teaching the mechanics of the fight is a lot better than wiping
---
&gt; WoW speedrunning doesn't require super precise execution or anything
---
I mean, your performance can be measured by efficiency which results in the output of time.  By being more precise you reduce your time and get better records.
---
I raided on a laptop from vanilla to WotLK. It was a low mid-range laptop
---
Couldn’t agree more. That’s why I started two characters and power leveled one of them 😬
---
Yes, if the addon could displa quests depending on where you are that would be nice. I don't want to miss anything either. I am pretty sure there will be areas I'll skip but there will be ones I want to fully clear too.
---
Comments like this make me want to kill myself.
---
But if their subscriber counts are waaaaaaaaay down since WoTLK... how can that even remotely be true?
---
Do you really believe leveling now is as rewarding as it was in vanilla?
---
Not everything is about you.
---
I played every expansion since vanilla, primarily focused on pvp to the point where my pvp rank was seargent before i hit lvl 30 in vanilla.(i was still rather clueless though)
---
Tbc arena surely had its horrors, but even with the state of tbc classdesign they could have tuned stuff to better balance without pruning.
---
The pruning is most likely a product of blizzard making the game more and more casual to the point of its current form and has little to nothing to do with pvp.
---
Nothing in this game is hard-driven by pvp, with the exception of legions last half, pvp in wow has always been the limp little brother in the background of casual and hardcore pve aspects.
---
In Legion they separated pve from pvp balance wize and it was great, for all the rest of wow's history pve balance and attraction toward casuals has been more or less the entire drivingforce for changes in this game. 
---
When they made wow they werent even sure they would implement pvp at all in the game. And thats a fact from John Stats himself.
---
Im not here to step on anyones toes, but to blame anything regarding classbalance or tuning on arena is just flat out ignorant and has to be said. Pvp has always had extremely turbulent states of existance solely because of pve bullshit not being even CONSIDERED to have ANY impact AT ALL in pvp. Then if we're lucky we get the rare bandaid from the devs to tune down retarded shit in instanced pvp after massive outrages from the withering pvp community.
---
With the exeption of Legion ofc, god bless its soul.
---
Don't think you have to worry. Players now a days don't do almost anything for free, so they will already be charging 1-2g for the port. I most certainly won't be tipping if they are charging 2g to begin with.
---
If she dies then teabag her, she'll love it

Most went pretty deep into prot including shield slam. As the raid developed better healer and DPS gear they could move talents around for more TPS but I cannot recall ever not taking shield slam for our tanks.  You would still put points in Arms/Fury for threat, just not nearly as much as in private servers. I MTed for a full clear AQ/Naxx guild in vanilla.  The builds your talking about with ARM/PROT did exist, but it wasn't for AQ/NAXX/BWL.  Those were the I don't want to respec PvP builds and I still want to tank and stun.  It was meant to reduce how frequently you respecced as it was costly to do.  I ran deep arms all week with minimal prot to tank most content, but respecced for every content raid weekly then back for pvp/misc tanking.
---
The P-Servers are no indication of how this WOW will work.  I cannot express this enough to everyone.  But no-one wants to believe it.    It's a different set of rules for vanilla.  While many players didn't understand much of the MMO mechanics, it's folly to believe that everyone then was ignorant and suddenly today we have infinite more knowledge and understanding.
---
Unpopular(?) opinion but I think at some point you need a gear reset.  A large % of the playerbase is never going to clear BWL.  You can't keep adding onto things that are even harder than AQ40, for the small % of players that can actually go there.  Even catchup raids like ZG will still be difficult for many people.  If someone has more specific stats that'd be great, but I'd guess that less than 20% that ever logged into WoW cleared BWL.
---
Not if you want to discuss the differences in games. Asking the same question wouldn't work if you asked it on the modern retail reddit; which classic players don't read.
---
&gt;I wonder what else is different...
---
It will be fun to watch all those min/maxing pserver *veterans* who never played real Vanilla lick the ground of BWL due to not being as easy as they thought it will be...
---
LFG/LFR gone

No instancing/layering/sharding/cross-server shit

I’m okay with flying mounts, but force people to unmount when they land. Or give a debuff so they’re easily countered if some warrior charges you out of the sky, etc. Or put a CD on flying mount like you can’t remount for 5 minutes or something. Then flying mounts will be used for macro travel, not literally flying 40 yards to kill the next quest NPC. Also, lower flying speed so it’s not economical to use it in these stupid ways.
---
Talent trees back. Part of the joy of talent trees was calculating and strategizing what you would spec into. Also, you could spend points in &gt;1 spec.
---
Talent specialization specific spells. Like in retail Frost mage not getting fire spell, etc.
---
Class balancing: it’s okay for classes to exist that are support classes. The only measure of value to a PvE encounter shouldn’t be dps. This same thing applies to arena balancing. Some classes/specs SHOULD suck in arena. That’s because their value doesn’t need to be defined as equal to every other class and spec in every aspect of the game (pve vs pvp strength)
---
A healer shouldn’t be able to out-heal a dps going ham on them. Healing is a support class. Using crowd control is the mechanic to allow for time to heal. It literally just doesn’t make sense. Imagine someone stabbing you and you just walk around healing yourself faster than they can stab you. To the point where they just stop stabbing you because it’s futile. They’ve gone through all their dps CDs, full rotation of maximizing their dps. You just aren’t going to die. How does this make any sense?
---
Dps classes get crazy self heals. They’re dps. Why do they have healing abilities?
---
I could go on...

Just start pressing the delete button.  When you get halfway through deleting BC - Stop.  Then look at everything you just deleted and consider a different course.  Retail is ruined.  Lazy Blizzard.

You do know nature’s swiftness can be used with lightning bolt and chain lightning? The flexibility of being able to use it offensively or defensively is what makes it so worth it to get.

I can't think of a better way to make her want to quit.
---
Because subscription doesn't actually make that much money. One individual dumping money into online store purchases such as mounts and/or tokens brings in way more than subscriptions.
---
It's the main reason why games continue to pursue offering purchase options because a handful of people spend unbelievable amounts of money.

&gt;People who come here and ask questions they can find in 3 seconds on Google can suck my left nut.

---
Do you feel like your culling unfavorable behavior? 
---
Do you think you or anyone else is gaining literally anything from being an ass to someone who dared ask a question that could be found out on google?
---
Please explain, if you don't mind, how being subjected to easily google-able questions makes literally a single iota of difference?
---
This is silly. TBC opened up the best for both worlds from a PvE standpoint. Also, while seen as guild-destroying at first, 25-man/10-man raiding was SO MUCH BETTER than 40/20. I was a much bigger fan of ZG and AQ20 because of the reduced group sizes and making each person matter more.
---
The biggest negative thing was the flying mount destroying world PvP and PvP-specific gearing (resilience). Even then those things were only at max-level and there was plenty of cool stuff happening since 60-70 took so long.
---
People are saying Skarm is stuck in the private server meta but he always says the same thing and it is great advice!
---
Talk to your healers and dps!
---
at the start of raiding when all of the raids dps are in blues, threat is not an issue so just stack defense and mitigation.
---
once your guild starts to gear up, talk to your dps and healers. do your healers always finish boss fights with mana left over? are there 10 dps that have to hold back because they are getting too close to pulling aggro? if you communicate well between tank, dps and healers you will find a better balance that you can put on more threat gear and your dps can go harder and your healers will need to use more mana but the fight will be shorter.
---
tldr: 
---
max mitigation early. when your guild gears up play around with some threat gear to find what fits the raid.
---
IMO this system is best implemented in a game like UO, where nothing is irreplaceable and the best gear was player-crafted. This way participating in pvp also pushed the player-driven economy.
---
The people who reserver make the groups usually anyways. And I dont see a problem with that they are really forward and honest about what item they want and they fill the group with people who dont need it. Everyone wins from reserving.
---
Thought you meant Los Tres Caballeros from Disney, that would have been a special way to pass the time, although a good choice too. Indeed it's gonna be a solid activity

Someone tested level 1 lightning bolts and claimed not to observe any form of spell crit suppression.
---
Those warlicks have some pretty good *services* ;)
---
PLUR!
---
No. But i also dont expect it to be that way. The per level gain is quite definitely lower, alone due to the fact that you have twice as many levels. Also, what about leveling in vanilla do you consider rewarding? The gear lasts longer cause leveling itself lasted longer. The quests since MoP, the content and game design (quest design) since then i consider to be miles ahead of vanilla. It can still be an exciting journey especially if youre new.
---
Might be the other way around, actually. :)
---
Microtransactions.
---
Good post.
---
I mean it’s just my opinion. To say it’s silly....is kind of silly.
---
I started MMO’s with classic back in the beginning of 2005 and played through WotLK.
---
The heroic stuff started in the wotlk patch after Ulduar IIRC. Actually, there were ways of obtaining extra "heroic" loot off some bosses in Ulduar too, by performing specific tasks which made the bossfights harder, but in the following patches (ToC and ICC), I think you just clicked a button to change the instance to a heroic raid.
---
I'ma keep track of the healing done in each dungeon and invoice the group members based on services rendered too.
---
Tanks get a 75% discount.
---
Your comment doesnt even make sense, sorry mate.
---
Honestly I like that response. Maybe without the attitude I imagined reading it :)
---
Enforce static raid sizes for all raids again -- remove the flex option.
---
Flex changes membership in a raid team from a sign of dedication and competency to a sign that you happened to show up on raid night and the raid leader let you pile in with everyone else who showed up. It makes guild raiding too much like LFR.
---
You need to remember that feral druids were really awful in the first half of Vanilla, which is where much of their bad reputation comes from. At this time folks started to make lists on which specs were viable for raids. The old feral not making the cut was the right call back then. 
---
Classic will have the druid as it was in the second half. This means the cat gains AP from agility and the armor modifier for Dire Bear Form went from 125% to 360%, both obviously enormous boosts. Also techniques like power-shifting and the value of MCP weren't known back then. 
---
So yes, Ferals were vastly underrated in vanilla.
---
They are amazing in 5-mans and very good off-tanks in raid, due to their flexibility. While they can main-tank most fights and are better for a few, in general a Warrior is the better choice as a Main Tank, especially as gear gets better.
---
I have never had even one side button on my mouse :D
---
Here's a *tip* - just ask your mage how much they want.
---
Think we'll have a maintenance day that first Tuesday.?
---
I did powershift, without that dps is quite low.
---
If he ever did take control...we would all suffer under the oppressive tyranny of that maniac. He has to be stopped!
---
I don't think artificial limiting could be the answer and I don't think "balance" could be either. 
---
Interesting playing field, the freedom of choice (even if it is not "balanced" to some) is what makes an RPG an interesting and evolving yet not so unfair but even tho a fun and enjoyable experience.
---
Dunno how you can worried about taking it to a “not fun place” when you’re **already using a speed leveling guide to level**

Do you mean kinda like a BiS list? 
---
Personally I don't really give a shit if they were to add achievments, but they should stay hidden from public view. I don't really buy the argument that people should strive to achieve the things that you say they should(character and items). If they wan't some goals that blizzard puts in the game for them why do you care?
---
I don't like the idea of the meta on current wow where you need to link X achievement to get into a specific group being brought to Classic. So yea, as long as they stay hidden it shouldn't really matter. 
---
Regardless I'm sure somebody will come up with an addon that gives these people their achievement list to work through
---
... Crul  + Dooms Edge is amazing in second raid tier. Sure, CTS might be better, for a non human. But its still an amazing axe. In AQ, everyone can get their AQ40 hatchet which is very good. Sure some swords are a bit better but you have to compete with rogues for them. Orc Warrs get axes all to themselves.

I actually meant to reply to a specific person and replyed to the thread.

I would say Stormwind is comparable.
---

---
I see anything related to the Princes Bride, I upvote.

I would say no. The reasons barrens chat was what it was is that the zone was about 2x larger and has quests for 2x longer of levels than oyher zones. Because of this horde players generally were in the barrens for a long time.
---
These are the vibes we need!

Corrupted Ashbringer felt like more of an achievement. &lt;3

Not really.  Alliance doesn’t have a zone where 3/4 races get funneled at level 10 where there’s nothing but huge runs between quests spots.
---
Sorry I edited my post after you have seen it. Calendar/Raid planner and guildbank would be great tools

Chances are good you’d never get grand Marshall / high warlord. I had a guild mate who was out of work for months and still never got to high warlord doing nothing but BGs with dedicated guild groups.
---
Isn't Joana 39 or something? I don't give enough shits about the generational bullshit to know, but that feels kinda old-ish.
---
Welcome and also remember the most important thing is to have fun. That being said, the current model of retail WoW is the polar opposite of how things were in Vanilla, the drive now is purely for speed, I.E massive pulls gathering everything up and AoEing it down. A LOT of people are going to be in for a bad time once Classic releases if they believe this will work, aside from tank HP/Gear and ooming healers. Threat mechanics will absolutely not allow this type of play, but as will all things it's going to be relearned through massive amounts of pain and corpse runs. Do not be surprised to see 2+ hour dungeon runs in places like BRD, Mara, Strath.
---
TLDR: #1 Have fun, #2 Watch a few videos on YouTube showing older Classic / P server dungeon runs to get a feel for how slow it's actually going to go.
---
I had the most fun in vanilla when I was in a large casual guild.  Usually just messing around out in the open world and goofing off in guild chat.  It’s when I joined a raid guild that the game started to feel like a job.
---
What do you mean by Guild Bank? because we don't know how Blizzard (or if) will implement its API for classic, so i don't know if it will be possible to fetch the guild's bank informations
---
Wow forums introduced me to ytmnd... I had totally forgotten about it. The feels.

LMAO.

"There aren't that many stuns in Vanilla". Rogue stuns. Warrior stuns with charge and intercept and conc blow (resisting charge is actually OP because they don't gap close with you if you are moving). Priest stuns with blackout. Paladin stuns. Druid stuns, Hunter stuns. Fire mage stuns.  
---
But the charge resists are the biggest and most common.  You wreck other warriors.  
---
" In ALMOST every situation bigger hitbox, a stun and more health is better than orc stun resistance. "  
---
That is a joke.
---
A'lar was harder than lootwalker/solarian and skippable. So you wouldn't do him immediatly anyway. And it didn't need full T5 gear for arcane. All it took was 2/5 set boni. Lootwalker was, as the name suggests, 100% free lot and dropped T5 shoulders. And hydross wasn't an issue at all because fire &gt; frost anyway. And even if you were frost, he's only immune to frost damage in p1.

I still remember my servers first attempt at a scepter bearer was so dismal and his guild so up their own ass that when a rival to them showed up ( Wasn't even close to the first guild in terms of progression but enough to be considered a rival )
---
 First guild and scepter wallowed in honored for weeks and other guild blew past them, was actually funny how the second guild was killing Eranikus? in Moon Glade in the middle of the night in a big secret raid just to get it done without the other guild running panicked interferance.

First guild never caught up and AQ opened with the first guild in full panic mode trying to complete everything in only a handful of nights.

After that comes the real work where you have to write and re-write and clean the instructions. Test the guide and fix the errors and inconsistencies. Clean the guide even more and test more. Then make the Addon and Website, and even more cleaning and testing...

I'm not the biggest Horde fan :D so I don't think I want to go thro all that again.

No, Barrens chat became famous because it was a 10-25 non-contestant leveling area for 3 of the races, and some undead would actually make the journey as well. Coincidentally most of the players never make it past level 10 so they would spent a lo of time just chilling in Barrens chat. 
---
Alliance does not have a similar area.
---
DO NOT pick the trinket as a druid!  I made this mistake in vanilla thinking it was faster/better.  It is not.  I had to win the tournament twice to get my pole.
---
The trinket is a waste of bag space for druid unless you for some reason want to be a slightly slower fish form.
---
Not just that - but the fact that you do a bunch of quests, leave the barrens, and come back later to do more in the south barrens, then leave but come back even later to do RFK and RFD, you're never really very far removed from the barrens until well into your 40's. It's very much the hub of a lot of the horde experience, and I just don't think the alliance has anything quite the same.
---
Can someone link me a priest weapon that a hunter could actually make an argument for?
---
What makes you think I haven’t watched his videos? Your first sentence is literally the point of my post.
---
I think it’s risky to rely on gimmicky shit like that. I wouldn’t be surprised if blizz considers it a bug and nerfs it (e.g. the MCP use could trigger a 10 min cooldown or something). There is precedent for that — they didn’t like people using the barman shanker or the arcanite reaper and nerfed them with weapon speed normalization. (man, i was so pissed about that. it’s no joke to make a reaper!)

Or maybe the development ideology has moved towards convenience is king.
---
Imagine thinking 5% HP makes you a better tank than 5 weapon skill. 5 weapon skill lets you wear 3% less hit in your gear, which means a tauren has to wear 2-3 pieces less mitigation gear to have equal threat to an orc. This amounts to more mitigation than 5% HP.
---
That's not how it works. Layering is just Sharding+ like /u/ganjjo described.
---
Your damage as Hunter does indeed drop of during the span of vanilla. But that does not mean you wont be needed, Hunters provide great benefits and usefulness even while doing low damage in raids.  
---
Dont let DPS meter be the thing that makes you dont play hunter.
---
Is that the pally one with the daggers on the shoulder pads?
---
At the highest levels, obviously every advantage you can inch out helps.
---
In a relatively easy game like wow, or even harder games like starcraft, age doesn't really matter all that much as long as you're not trying to be in the top 0.2% of all players. Being 50 is no real problem if you're fine with being in the top 5% of all players.
---
That kind of attitude sort of became the norm in Wrath (the dungeon you're thinking of is in Wrath).  The game sort of evolved into blasting through everything at breakneck pace, and the playerbase evolved with it.

I don't think they are pushing the hardcore out. It's more the opposit in fact. 
---
Retail now catter for 2 types of player. Hardcore Raider/MM+ and ultra casual.
---
For the hardcore :
---
\- Really good and hard Raid (you can say what you want, raiding in retail is far more interesting than in classic).
---
\- Challenging high mm+ key with meta change each patch and mechanic change every week.
---
\- Big time investement needed to be ahead of the curve
---
They are the one who make other people dream about the game (look at the success of first world race stream) so they attract new players
---
For the ultra-casu :
---
\- LFR/LFG
---
\- Catchup mechanic, free epic loot, itemization with luck (titanforge bullshit).
---
\- No need to grind every lvl of profession.
---
\- Easy streamlined class with no more than 10 frequently used skills each.
---
They are the one who buy the most on the cashshop.
---
The problem is for the population between those 2 group. Not enough hardcore to enjoy raiding, nor MM+, but not casual enought to want to be given free loot and free raid tier.
---
Hey, hunters are bad (and I am sad about that), but I'm still going to play one.
---
Rogue here, I used to hate Nightslayer compared to the iconic Bloodfang. Then I played a pserver and it took forever to get near full t1... but once I got it I fell in love. Boobie shoulders for life
---
You can aim for it, but that's faster than most reasonable expectations of what a top tier, world-first racer can do.
---
It depends on how big server populations are.  It's a lot harder to track blacklisted players on big servers.
---
For the Horde!
---
Excuse my ignorance... but what is powershift? Is it to shift in and out of car for the energy gain?
---
I don't know how old joana is but millenials go up to late 30s.
---
Well it isn't mages summoning 27 lazy people.
---
this is 100% what it feels like to me as well. Diablo with more buttons to press. I don't hate the experience of playing retail, but the removal of RPG elements and overemphasis on generic loot farming doesn't provide me with any incentive to advance my characters.

I did that but in the opposite direction. As a dwarf I travelled to Mulgore to get Rake. Dunno if it was technically in classic though...

My wife was and still is like that when we play, and shes been a class officer and raid healed mythic content :P. I always mark her with a diamond and me with a star when we are out questing so she doesnt loose track. When I invite others to the party for group quests, i mark them as well, when they ask i just reply "welcome to the skittles crew" good times
---
I mained a warrior in vanilla and was off tank for my guild. If I wasn’t raiding or tanking dungeons I was in BGs, I ran this build.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVGtdAbo0zZEbzbx
---
My pvp game was not optimal for sure but respeccing was expensive and I was had with money.
---
Regardless this build was a happy medium for me doing Pve content and farming AV.
---
The main tank in my guild was a hybrid of fury and port, more on the prot side.
---
Survival Hunter is now a dedicated melee spec since the start of Legion, yes.
---
Your making it sound like any other race is stunned 24/7 is that really the case? No.
---
The only situation when a stun resist matters is if that stun is used against you. No other time at all (i mean we could count the times a rog stuns your healer instead of you because it will be higher chance of hitting said stun etc.) but thats it. Out of 10 stuns, 7 will still hit you.
---
Name _one_ situation where any of the tauren traits is WORSE than the orc traits that doesnt include a stun on you.
---
How does cheaper maintenance on infrastructure have value? That's your question?
---
Hey you gotta hook me up with your trees guy, I needa smoke that for launch.
---
Blood and thunder!
---
Death &amp; Taxes and Nihilum were pushing content back then and it had no effect on my server or my guild.  Not all servers will be pushing crazy fast content and most guilds will not be doing that.  I feel your last point is overblown.
---
Trolls will be trolls.  Always have and will be.  The way classic servers are (or hopefully will be) set up will self moderate complete fucktards.  If you spam racist edgy shit in trade you will be banned.   If you ninja loot stuff you will be called out.  If you are a chore to deal with drama wise you will not find a permanent stable home.  These things are structural to the game and will prevent most current troll mentalities.
---
I also think that people are underestimating the current generation of young people being all about the memes.  Some, if not a majority, will be pleasant and will conform to the norms that were, and have been, core to the vanilla culture.  Just look to the private server crowd and you can see they were able to create vast communities very similar to what was baseline in the original community.  
---
Give it a chance before you write it off.
---
What is edge lord may never dull (?)... shit, I thought I had something there.
---
I agree. Take the lessons learned and apply it to WoW 2 or a new MMO. There's no winning strategy for retail - a lot of the existing players LIKE the current design. A lot of former players hate it. 
---
With a new MMO, nobody would feel that they lost something.
---
Your question is exactly the one that Blizzard punted on back in WotLK.  Rather than experimenting and iterating on ways to make finding groups and friends easier, they went around the problem with LFG and in the process short-circuited the most important feedback loop the game had: meeting new people.
---
I dont understand how people are able to do this much work for free. Really well done mate
---
Nothing, game is gone beyond rescue. Scrap and begin anew.
---
Ummm, orcs can forego Edgemaster's from the start. Devilsaur set OP.   
---
"  one MH and one OH for the entirety of the first 5 phases "  
---
Umm, no. Give a couple tanks the Armaments and then all your orcs are getting axes in AQ. Doom's Edge drops like candy and is farmable. So is Deathbringer.  
---
" Any warrior that is able to get Maladath and Edge Masters Handguards will be doing more damage with a CTS or AQR MH than an Orc with Deathbringer, Edge Masters and say Doom's Edge "  
---
No. An Orc with Deathbringer, Doom's Edge and even just Devilsaur set bonus (or perhaps sacrifical gauntlets in ZG), may actually out dmg CTS or AQR + edgemasters. But why are you comparing CTS and AQR to deathbringer? That is totally unfair. Compare Crul and Blessed Qiraji to CTS and AQR instead,
---
These brainlets can't think for one minute before jumping on Blizzard's balls. It's hilariously pathetic.
---
So *that's* why I never found that dead bitch?
---
The new classic implementation is not like anything people have seen on private servers nor in actual vanilla. That is why people go through the length of finding this evidence. And there are loads of evidence. Because its wrong. 
---
At least you actually viewed the videos before just bursting some bs out, so thank you for that. I see you do agree with me that current implementation is wrong.
---
Go enhancement until 40. 32 at minimum.
---
Ele is super boring until chain lightning.
---
This guy doesn't fuck
---
It was mine. And I was clueless.
---
Exactly, when you don't have energy anymore you shift out and back in cat form, you get 60 energy (40 with the talent + 20 from this helm https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345 ) with good timing you do it just before the tick and you got 80 energy to use.
---
If her attachment to the idea of playing a video game is so fragile that the husband is prevented from having a brief teaching moment then no matter what it wouldn't have worked out.  This isn't hovering, this isn't breathing down her neck telling her to use this ability, to not attack that mob, to go there, no over there, wtf you noob.  This is teaching a new person that WoW's default keybinds are godawful, and that it's easier to do it this way.  
---
The amount of time it would take to inform anyone of this is shorter than the fucking intro.  It's more brief than the amount of suggesting and pestering he did to get her to this point.  It's more innocuous than all the nonstop "babe, I'm so excited for Classic" that she's been hearing for a year.  Any attempt to make such instruction seem to be cumbersome are willfully pedantic.

It's my discord server, there is more then 1 guide link rn :p
---
I’m sorry but no, +5 weapon skill does not let the warrior wear 3% gear.
---
Yeah, it's definitely a dumb argument. You start with classic because it seems like an interesting game to you, right? It's not complicated.
---
Not only does it not stack, but apparently classic handles crit rating differently to pservers for enemies that are higher lvl than you so crit % are going to be lower at 60.
---
You are delusional if you think that the stun resist is only good against rogues. It completely dumpsters other warriors. It dumpsters everyone who uses grenades.
---
Same sort of people don't realize that the older range of millennials are approaching 40 now.
---
1 to maybe around 20-25 sure you can have different paths (darkshore/stonetalon/ashenvale and westfall/loch modan/redridge), but from there you're going to go pretty much the same path because there's not enough zones to fill in entire stretches twice. You're going to visit most if not all the zones on a single character.
---
Dude, the metal mohawk!
---
I Don't know about other class's but I know when I was Tanking through Vanilla I found out pretty much straight away that the Tanks of all the major guilds would gravitate toward each other.
---
We all had common goals and issues within the game.
---
Each of us had that one DPS that couldn't help but pull threat we all liked to complain about, we each had that ONE healer that was so good he could probably heal the entire raid solo, and soon and soforth.
---
This group also was the most congradulatory group of people ever, Your guild got a new kill, even days later you will have someone giving you a quick congrats if they weren't around when it happened.
---
Got a rare tanking drop or just something relatively uncommon, (For my server it was the tank trinket in BWL, every single scarab that dropped was a celebration.)
---
We would see each other everywhere, whether it be on the way to raids, or grinding consumable mats for those of us who weren't wholly funded by our guilds.
---
Honestly I remember at one point a one of the Tanks was getting camped by an entire alliance guild in the Searing Gorge entrance to BRM, and while his guild did try and help him it was actually a collection of around 20 or so Prot warriors from various guilds that rolled up and spanked our way through the offending alliance guild, absorbing so much damage and causing such a distraction that the few DPs and healers that were also being camped managed to rally and wipe the alliance players.
---
It was easily the slowest and dumbest fight I had ever been apart of and I loved it.
---
That Warrior tank community was basically dead by the time Wrath rolled around though, I miss those idiots.
---
Now I'm in my 30s it really may be the only way to get that creative again
---
I have played Horde since retail launched. My friends and I will be swapping alliance for classic to get a new experience. Let’s see if it lasts.
---
Lok-tar ogar!
---
Now that I'm in my 30s it may be the only way to get that creative again
---
I agree, berserking is an underrated threat-gen tanking ability. Tank is the only class that can reliably take advantage of it. I gotta use demonic runes on my rogue to get more out of it lol
---
Why is ignoring them not a solution for you? Those post don't get upvoted because they're not contributing anything new and (when answered) quickly disappear into the void. And btw: 10 people telling you to stop being lazy and google something is toxic, especially towards new visitors.
---
actually googled.
---
He's born in 1980 (according to his page). Millenials seem to start in the early 1980s, so he'd be right on the edge.
---
If he had said: "if others can carry my DPS that is fine". I would have read it and agreed but the way I read it is more asking the lines out looking for a carry in pve.
---
There are other jobs to be done other than just heal, DPS, and tanking and doing those jobs while bringing your utility is not being carried.
---
Did you even raid in Vanilla?
---
More like shimmering flats
---
It’s too late. You saw what happened when they tried to get rid of flying mounts in WoD. People were outraged. The same would happen if they removed dungeon finder and LFR. And I understand that. You can’t give something like that to players for years, then suddenly take it away because “We realized it’s fucking awful lol srry”. The playerbase is too used to these conveniences.
---
But, these things are what killed the game. Too late to go back on it now.
---
&gt;only
---
Straw man. It’s strictly superior vs Rogues because they so heavily depend on stuns. Mages, Druids, Warlocks, Priests, Hunters — far less so.
---
We are all the only legendary elite champion that can save the forest on this blessed day
---
Why is back pedaling bad? It's it just because it's a little slower than strafing?
---
It still has the benefit of keeping you facing the mob you're fighting without having to turn constantly.
---
I think that WoW moved so far away from the game I loved that changing single feature wouldn't do it. It's more about the general philosophy.
---
- level content being huge, taking weeks to hit max level with one char. Not 3 weeks to hit it with 12 chars.
---
- reasonably difficult elite quests that are are way more easier in a group. Resulting in random invites and meeting people along the level way.
---
- most important: get rid of any stupid X-server tools. No hopping, no Lfring, no group finder. Focus on the server community where your reputation matters.
---
- important professions where people that invest lots of time get a reward for that
---
- no quest hubs. Hidden Quests. Explore the world.
---
- having a decent 5 men dungeon content that lasts a while. Not a "hit 60 do 10 lfg go Lfr after 3 hours" content. Yes powergamers and hardcore raiders will treat classic the same but.. I don't care. I really look forward to Scholo, Strat and UBRS. And all the juicy quests to even get in there.
---
- epic class quests
---
- be able to attain something that lasts, I. E. an epic mount. Not mount #225.
---
Just from the top of my head. There's a million more.
---
not improved weapon totems.
---
Tribox ele shamans is fun. One as leader and 2 on follow. Triple instant cast LB then triple shock deletes any player in one GCD, triple CL can wipe a crowd, and triple chain heal tops everyone up fast.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
This would feel amazing to jump into and explore.
---
No servers because it hasn't released yet. They are just giving people the opportunity to d/l in advance. Also this client is used for the stress tests. So servers appear during the test window.
---
Victory rush for warrior. I played a warrior after this was added and now i really miss it.
---
You're selling Kargoz short. I'm saying he's one of the best streamers to watch, period. None of this bs about he's a generalist therefore you should be looking for a specialist agenda you're spewing.
---
Herbalism is better than mining imo. Herbs will always be in demand because everyone needs pots always. Mining is for blacksmithing and engineering, which is a little more niche.
---
AT this point they need a new game but that new game needs to carefully do xpacs. Idk how to do it so your old gear matters -- -maybe the Xpac should be a whole new world in game and when you go to that world your gear has to stay on azeroth or something? Like the portal just strips away all non - organic life so that you awke up nakey on the new world and play through that world or something? Im not sure.   
---
But there will always be some degree of power creep and after enough iterations you get to the point where old gear just doesn't matter. YOu really gonna make a new player that subs to retail right now do all the content from vanilla to today? they'd never ever ever ever ever catch up - so why bother playing if you cant reach your friends?   
---
Theres a balance somewhere that the genre never really found
---
Keep fighting the good fight.
---
Im all for helping new players, but if I've only got two hours to play and I want to run a dungeon, and it takes half an hour to form a group and get there, yeah, I'm gonna be mad if we wipe over and over to something that's either been explained to new people or so obvious anyone can grasp it.
---
Should have put your PvP emphasis in title. :D
---
My understanding of the tech is limited which is why I’m asking the question.
---
I wasn’t sure if they are able to write the code in a way where they could use a single server for multiple patches.
---
Track it with screenshots and make an ongoing album.
---
I definitely want to try some RPing it sounds super immersive.
---
But I'm curious on RP servers if you can ever "turn off" the RP and raid for real without 39 method actors in discord. 
---
Anyone have experience with this? Will I need two different characters on two different servers?
---

---
I read your comment. You said that "orcs stun resist is only goid when you get stunned" in 5 lomg sentences. Thanks for clarifying that.
---
Classic really is more like a job... Wait till you see.
---
I have always wished they had just gotten a spammable ranged spell to make Shockadin a real thing.
---
I still use SOJs as a stand-in term for a secondary-market currency. It's an interesting phenomenon.
---
&gt;Please note that the server doesn't encrypt passwords inside the database and stuff, so PLEASE DO NOT use your real / already used elsewhere logs on this site (and you shouldn't on any other site :P)

That's enough information for me to not even touch your website with a 10 foot pole. I'm not looking forward to the day where you will leak all our private information.
---
Honestly you should start with a smaller project to get some experience and not with such a huge undertaking where users must trust you to store private information (which you yourself admitted can't do securely.)

anything with spellpower for a spell hunter lmao

Do I want to be ganked while questing / farming? No
---
Do I want to RP? No
---
PvE server it is
---
I wouldn't bother with that guy, he's a moron.
---
Speccing 30/21(NS) is going to be the best setup for enchance if you want to PVE and PVP and not have to respec constantly between both. You fill your niche roll in raids with the melee group having improved WF totem and the mana effeciency to totem twist that a resto would have (excluding having mana tide and improved restototems). Spec into ele instead of resto if you want to go hardcore pvp dps.
---
Don’t forget to “talk” to her about what she should eat, drink, wear, posture, etc while playing.  Because her fun playing a 15 year old game killing pixelated dragons should be dictated by you, while being predicated on her being “good” at a game.
---
yeah but what would be the text like? wouldn't make that much sense since the original text "I prefer:, I said the real, perfection" wouldn't fit with the idea here :/
---
you have all the time in the world to burn out from 8.2 and be hyped again, good timing
---
Blizzard os squishing the level soon (probably to level 60). I have high hopes that talent tress are coming back in some form
---
Marking a focus target is hugely important.  If the DPS is just going off on whatever, you'll never hold aggro and that's on them not you.  They also need to wait a few seconds before starting in.  
---
If they won't follow kill priority, keep the mobs off the healer and let the DPS die a few times.  They'll figure it out.  Classic is a much slower paced game than retail.
---
IMO, cataclysm lore was a perfect way to bring everything back to vanilla and truely make a WoW 2 sequel. 
---
I'm sure everyone would flip their shit losing flying mounts, but you get revamped zones so there's the nostolgia of returning to them and see the destruction. They could even say the cataclysm rewoke old enemies and have revamped classic raids like we got with naxx in WotLk.
---
Yea it's definitely not the most popular of the last 6 months.
---
Thank you thank you, that’s why I asked to be corrected if I was wrong
---
- casts blessing of wisdom-
---
Shield block to pop revenge is a good tactic, not sure why youd say to never use it here.
---
Yeah, NE should most definitely just stay in Darkshore.  I'd even say  it's probably worth it to use the other the mountain skip for Dwarves/Gnomes instead of going to Westfall.  
---
YMMV.
---
Transcendence set,  hands down.
---
I'm sure the maintenance window will be a thing. Maybe for hardware stuff, database maintenance...etc. Also classic is releasing in phases. There will be active development on the code through the 6 phases at least. Lots of reasons to still set expectations of a specific maintenance window.
---
Get rid of level scaling. For some reason, I thought this was a really good idea at first. But after playing with it for a couple of weeks, I absolutely despise it. Put it back to the way it was.
---
I dont like feeling forced to do repetitive content for upgrades, like artifact power ore azerite. I dont like 95 difficulties. Lfr flex normal heroic mythic mythic+, mythic+ keystones 1-15. I dont like professions being an utter waste of time. I dont like 500+ mounts. I dont like feeling like a god at everything. I dont like pet battles giving experience. I dont like the story anymore. I dont like how tiersets progressively got shittier until they stopped making them. I dont like the way specs work without talent trees. I dont like being able to switch whenever I feel like it. I dont like because of shitty design gold has inflated to rediculous levels. I dont like transmog because pretty much everyone looks the same. I dont like level boosting, and especially dont like how they've made leveling suck so bad you have to consider a boost. I dont like both the collective homogenization of classes and the neutering of class complexity. I dont like how player reputation means nothing where everything is cross server.
---
What could make me enjoy retail? At this point it's not even the same genre of game so I dont think it's fixable without ruining it for the current playerbase.
---
Thanks I thought I got it wrong! 
---
I think, with the release of classic, there will be no need to change the current trajectory of retail. Building upon classic is a possibility, but I agree with others here saying retail is too far gone. Besides, in it's current state, retail is making ActivisionBlizzard plenty of money through microtransactions. Which require a minimal amount of investment, yet produce plenty of revenue.
---
So I honestly see retail going more and more in the way of the printing press for ActivisionBlizzard. I think that, assuming classic will be successful, retail might even go the free2play route and go to a full-on modern, microtransaction fueled model. While classic will be the premium, subscription based alternative. 
---
Games like Fortnite and Apex Legends have shaped the industry in a way that won't be easily reversed. ActivisionBlizzard is a large corporation that needs to keep it's shareholders onboard. When shareholders see the profits coming from their competitors with their aforementioned money printers, they will jump ship. That's just how capitalism works. So, until a company finds a better model for attracting shareholders, the f2p microtransaction model will dominate the market.
---
Just bc something isn't competitive doesn't mean it isn't fun. That is part of the fun. Saying that enchance is nowhere near competitive is also wrong. As a support class it is, pure dps tunnel vision it isn't.
---
What do you think is then? Boomer/zoomer is by far the most common one I've seen used through all of 2019.
---
Im praying that @Zsep meant Wc3 The Frozen Throne..
---
Most raid groups are going to bring and prioritize people that attend raids every time that come prepared and don’t cause problems. As for the gear gap problem. I don’t have a problem with people outgearing me just shows how much more time and effort they’ve put in the game.
---
In regards to Point #1, I think FFXI did an excellent job of this. Admittedly, it is a vastly different game. But, there were certain items (earrings and rings), rewarded at the end of completing the missions of each expansion, that were effectively BiS items for 10+ years. They took months to obtain, but it was worth it when the single item was useful for so long.
---
Because you lose a lot of rage using Shield Block. Both from taking less damage and from spending 5 on Shield Block.
---
On a PvP-server I really like Shadowmeld. Like when you are waiting somewhere you can just turn invisible.  
---
I also found the guide you were talking about... I think, it was called "Elune's Spirit", not "Elune's Chosen".  
---
I found that guide to be somewhat weird. According to it Starshards is supposed to be a viable spell for solo-leveling, which I really don't see no matter how you tailor your talents for it.  
---
I mean I can't say for sure, but I think frontloading with HF, Smite, MB and then adding SW:P and wand works well enough without ever having to use a shield. But maybe on higher levels the Mobhealth outscales the damage of my frontload too much to be able to wand down the mob during the SW:P time. If that happened, I might need to rethink.  
---
My build is a bit bad since I started that character before informing myself, so it had no Imp. wand and no Spirit-Tap. Now it has 4/5 wand and spirit tap is next. But interestingly enough, even without it, I can chainpull comfortably.  
---
I'm still not certain on how exactly I'll build when classic launches. But I really want to heal. A lot, so wand, tap and then holy is what I was thinking. It's supposed to end up with 14-32-5 and shall be changed to 21-30-0 once I start raiding... but might even stay 14-32-5 if others already have the spirit buff.
---
I haven't seen anything so far that should result in drastic meta changes. Keep in mind that fury tanking hasn't really been *the meta,* it's something a select few guilds did because they could. If you've got 40 players who have spent years just playing through vanilla over and over, and you massively outgear the content, you can play around with things like fury tanks. It has never been a normal practice or something you can just employ as your go-to tanking style. It's for guilds that farm the content so hard that they're trying to set speedrun records and need the highest possible TPS from the tank in order to let everyone go all out.
---
Not really useful for Classic since DM won’t be in right away
---
You and me both brother! But we gotta remember as a true hybrid we are a jack of all trades and master of none! #nochanges!
---
-casts blessing of might-
---
Check in every couple of hours, offer her a beer or iced tea or whatever is her bag. Otherwise, just leave her be to explore and do her thing... unless she wants a buddy to level up with.
---
The clue to shimmering flats is in the name though.
---
Same but I expect the worst
---
Sadly I'm already getting there.
---
I'll most likely follow this guide. However, a part of me wants to complete every single quest in classic and not rush to level 60.
---
What would be a good add-on to help me complete every quest available on each map/zone? (I'll probably be Ally).
---
Is this on Unreal 4 then?
---
When ppl say warlocks are not very good at first they are strictly talking pure dps in raids. They thrive in pvp all throughout in my opinion then later on they get even more godly. If you can get into MC and get tier one for warlock it is very powerful for pvp. Hunters are also great in pvp all throughout but will get outshined by warlocks later.
---
That might have been a part of the test, though. To try push layers to see how much stress is caused by maintaining extra layers. On live, it might conform to the 3000 player cap.
---
If you want to argue against such instruction, don't exaggerate like a child.  What I suggested was more along the lines of switching the controls from standard to southpaw.
---
as horde you have to go to stonetalon to learn minor run speed on boots. You have to have 225 enchanting and that trainer is only in stonetalon IIRC.
---
So you'd have to corpse run from Orgrimmar to stonetalon to actually learn that boot enchant as a level 5. It would be rough.
---
It doesnt matter what race you pick
---
But it's the betterment of WOW Classic and those poor objectified mages. That's what I can live with 😉
---
Yes I believe you are correct. You can not cast spells while a fish also shapeshifting would break the effect. BUT I dont think the opposite is true, being that if you are already shapeshifted using this trinket wouldnt break your current form. I came to this conclusion after much research reading archived post from way back in early vanilla. Lots of costumes, cosmetics ect. including noggenfogger working while shapeshifted. So I have a little hope =)
---
Awesome post my man, see you in Azeroth!
---
We need to go deeper!
---
Lol let's be honest that's not going to happen even if you half everyone's damage. You know BWL is cleared in like 30min, while vanilla wow has a 'quest' to clear it in 5h (which must've been considered hard enough to be a worthwhile deadline)
---
Alright, taking the plunge here....
---
**Catch-up Mechanics on gear is not inherently bad**
---
Here's the thing....Classic had them too. In a sense. ZG, DM and Blue PvP ranked gear up to rank 10 will essentially allow you to skip most if not all of MC. You can also get back in early AQ40 with just a bit of BWL gear with zg/dm/pvp blues as well.
---
The problem in my opinion is when you go way too far. For example, 8.2 trivialized all previous content with the inclusion of Benthic gear. **Now, I do ironically think that for the sake of BFA specifically, it was a good move**. But in general, this is a poor design philosophy.
---
Good catch-up mechanics can be found in Classic all the way up through WotLK via valorous vendors. Those vendors offered a limited amount of slots you could work towards, and it wasn't half bad.
---
**It also needs to be said - - - High end raiding guilds in Vanilla did not generally reclear all of MC/BWL past a certain point in their progression of AQ40 and especially Naxx**. Now, I'm talking about OG Vanilla, not Pserver folks. We simply did not have the time, because we were spending 10-20 hours a week wiping on Twin Emps, C'thun, and the back half of Naxx.
---
This made recruiting a nightmare, because we'd have to pass up on mechanically decent players whom were lacking gear.
---
When you need two or even 3 raid tier's worth of gear to be viable in the 4th and final tier, it makes you very unmarketable as a potential recruit.
---
I'm not saying each raid should replace the one before it, but I do think it needs to be understood that the opposite had its own issues as well.
---
They do this, I'd probably never unsub.
---
We're getting Classic realms at the end of August with ~2 years of planned content releases. Nothing else has been announced or promised nor is it likely to be.
---
Ugghh they are here to pay for a medicine degree, not a communications degree... Lol!
---
Just run naked. And it's not like that gear gives you any stats anywho
---
I play a classless WoW server (pick talents and spells from any class) and it is extremely fun. There are "arms warriors" with sinister strike, windfury, mage blink, etc. 
---
Refreshingly fun compared to retail.
---
Tanks for that!
---
I think you're misunderstanding the principle behind the "no changes" movement. The principle is not "nothing should be changed under any circumstances", but rather "the vanilla experience should be as close to authentic as possible."
---
Given that, it's rather obvious why "fix leeway and spell batching" is entirely consistent with the "no changes" position. If something outside of the code is radically changing how the game plays (ie. server infrastructure), then the code should be altered to provide as authentic an experience as possible, per the second principle above.
---
[You had your reason](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cbskwu/its_raid_night_boys/eti5jgm/).
---
Troll warrior for that Berserker racial.
---
And I've messaged a mod with no response. Which part of that rule do you think I'm breaking?
---
Mortal strike takes up another debuff slot. That and lower arms dps are the main reasons 2H fury is better
---
lmao, I can't unsee that now that you pointed it out!
---
&gt;alot of long walks between quests (and the boredom that brings).

Absolutely this! What else is there to do but start reading and join in lol

How old are you? 
---
There's a dramatic difference between when I was 15 y/o playing WoW and when I'm 27.  Being able to maintain a certain pace/focus/intensity is 10x easier as a young buck than when your tired af from working/gym/responsibilities.  and i'm not talking about the ability to play more i'm talking about the quality of playing when your actually online.  My eyes get tired, my body hurts more (lifting, sitting at a desk for work), etc etc.  It's just different.  IMO it's certainly a factor even if we are talking about pure /played
---
My first character was a dwarf warrior. I managed to get to rank 11 on my server before I burnt out in spring 2006. (I banked the most honor ever and dropped in % within my rank as I pushed towards rank 12 aka marshal)
---
Long story short I loved that title commander and knowing that I was like 4rh or 5th in line (as grand marshal himself was regent in vanilla since king was MIA and prince was too young) in succession of military rank helped fuel the RP I didnt know in had. It wasn't that I walked around larping or anything I just felt more connected to the lore and stories and characters as I was one of a hand full who was same rank or close to their rank. 
---
When you're just an adventurer you're no different that a Baker is storm wind or farmer in westfall tbh. But to have high officer ranking it feels like I'm "in the know" and never day dreamed about him being in the middle of lore but any time alliance armies are called upon and all ranking officers have reported for duty (eg battle at undercity) I can imagine he'd be there, not standing over left shoulder of king, but about 200yrds away in front of 100 men lined up 10x10. 
---
Dorky, yes.
---
I agree with some things, less with others. But I find your idea of flying mounts only available at fly monsters pretty sexy. It could lead to great moments, like I imagine flying to the opposite factions capital and if I lose my flying mount I'm in deep shit. I love that idea.
---
I remember in the old days (Before that "being a tank gives you 300% more aggro or whatever they did) we would all point the finger if someone pulled off the tank.
---
It's the DPS's responsibility to not do it. People who haven't played older releases of WoW probably don't realize it since now it's nearly impossible to do.
---
1) I agree with this point to an extent. I don't want to be wearing last expansion's gear at the end of the current one, but not immediately replacing my gear with greens makes me feel better about the work I put in previous expansion. I really liked the TBC -&gt; WotLK transition where if you were full T6 or S4, you replaced *some* of your pieces with well itemized blues/greens from quests. Our first Naxx clears were done mostly using our TBC epics. It doesn't feel bad replacing raid gear with raid gear.
---
2) I feel dumb for never having thought of this. I personally don't have problems with flying, but it would make a ton of sense to have flight masters essentially just be a "stable" for your flying mounts.
---
3) I like this within reason. I don't want to be forced to do old content all the time, but having certain things of value from old content is a plus. For example Swiftthistle farming.
---
4) Daily quests actually work great in my opinion, but within reason. They shouldn't be mandatory (e.g. time gating progression behind doing 3 weeks of dailies), but I like having the option of having a short routine to do during my daily logon for some extra gold or cosmetics or whatever. My two favorite daily experiences were Quel'danas (for the PvP that it instigated) and Halfhill for the time/reward/options aspects.
---
5) Agree. I think it's less about class homogenization (which I have separate problems with) and more about how they've tried to ease loot acquisition. Reduced number of secondary stats, fewer slots with secondary stats, items rolling with your selected role's main stat on it, etc.
---
6) Same, relevant to my take on previous point.
---
7) I'm fine with using small scale PvP as a balancing point, but what I'm not fine with is the thought that every class/spec combination needs to be viable in a generic comp (e.g. 2 DPS and a healer). Just because two frost DKs and a holy priest doesn't make a good comp doesn't mean that it *should*. It's perfectly fine for classes to be good in some comps and trash in others. This point is also a big part of my problem with class homogenization.
---
8) I like the idea of a perk tree. I'm not particularly OK with the current talent system either though. I'd be more OK with the current system if we had more choices, but there's almost always an obvious choice in each tier (not just a numbers thing) and only a few tiers have a meaningful choice in the first place. I'd like to see an extra 1 or 2 talents per row, and an extra few rows introduced as well.
---
9) Agree to an extent. I hate the concept of templates for PvP and handing out free PvE loot on a new patch feels wrong; however, I don't think forcing players into old raids is a good solution. People need a progression path outside of old raids to catch up when returning to the game (or being a new player), and frankly people get tired of carrying new guildies through old content. It'd be a lot of work, but I'd prefer some sort of dungeon-based progression path once a tier is finished. Maybe convert the raid to a 5 man dungeon with less trash or something so you still have to do the content, but it's farmable without a weekly timer and doesn't require a full raid of friends to go do content that doesn't benefit them in any way.
---
Good thread. I'm not sure I can distill all of my issues with retail WoW down into a handful of bullet points, but I like thinking about it.
---
That’s fair
---
As someone who did something very similar over the last 9 months the amount of effort that goes into something like this is extraordinary. I hope you learned a lot about the game in the process! It was a great learning experience for me!
---
No one said who's sunder it had to be
---
But with spellbatching you would be bad again. ☹️
---
certainly you will want to go down the elemental tree to start out.  I don't personally think flurry is that great because each windfury proc takes away a charge.  It is decent if you want to level with rock biter weapon, but I always preferred the windfury valleys and mountains over consistent average damage.  Clear casting and the 9% melee crit talent are all very useful.  So would increased earthbind and stoneclaw totem.  I would then probably go into resto to get improved ankh, 6% nature spell crit and nature's swiftness.
---
Retail is not a game anymore. It's a chore.
---
Man, you really could just google this.  There's tons of videos with professional opinions talking about this exact thing.
---
Good way yo look at it. also nice to break up the quest wall. I myself will be fishing during meal breaks and hunting useful recipes and other things at level instead of at max.
---
Agreed, the fact that the content is doable in LFR kinda killed it for me.
---
I member how epic it was when I entered naxx for the first time.
---
I had no interest in priest. This set made me want to try. It never happened
---
The problem with goal oriented RP like you mention, is that to RP you need to do what your character would, is he smart enough to know what rotation is best, does he know the boss mechanics, does he know what gear is the best for him, is he good or bad with money, ect. Truly if not told your character might not even know places exist and need to be told to go there or you could explore randomly. 
---
Just imagine trying to form a group to go to MC for the first time, most of the group is RPing how they don't know how to get there, and ect. Every first boss will be a wipe, you can't know the mechanics before hand as your character does not. Is that a good peice of loot for you? Do you RP voice range, can you hear the tank comands if you are 40ft away with 4 giant fireballs blazing next to you?
---
Thats if these servers try true RP, but we'll have to see
---
Goldshire on the Moonguard server.
---
No its not. Dualspec does not eliminate the problem of losing access to "CLASS" abilities because of your spec.
---
Take a hunter, from 1-10 you have a bow or gun and the game literally trains you to get used to using a bow or gun with the Hunter class. Then you get 10, spec Survival, and all of sudden you forget how to shoot a bow? It makes no sense and its incredibly jarring.
---
Must not have been very important then, huh
---
Hopefully WoW Classic IS WoW 2

I'm dead set on horde warrior but I can't decide between Undead and Tauren. 
---
I want to tank AND PvP in arms. It seems like it should be an obvious choice with Tauren having war stomp, extra HP, and additional melee range, but I much prefer undead character models.
---
Will I regret taking Will of the Forsaken for extra melee range + stun? And how much better are taurens for tanking??
---
Q is prime location keybind, i wouldnt put my mount there personally :D
---
I'll just chock this up as a troll at this point being that you've said :
---
His content is old
---
His content has inaccuracies
---
To be honest I didn't expect anything form AQ to make it on here. Pretty cool to see this
---
Started in the valley now the whole team fuckin’ here!
---
Thank you bruh, gonna use it c:
---
1) Most of the excitement of new content is new gear, so of course old gear (even old gear form within the current content) should be outdated by new gear. Now the specifics on the power scaling (i.e. how fast ilvls go up) is a good and valid discussion.  
---
2) Flying isn't what is keeping people from playing retail, this thought needs to die.  
---
3) Is boring and annoying and one of the things that drives me away from current retail (see the quest chain(s) you have to complete in old content to get allied races). People don't buy the new expacs to go to old zones. If they want to go there fine but don't force pointless bs just to "put players in the world". Also anything involving crafting that isn't alchemy in retail counts as pointless bs. That's a hint.  
---
4) Daily quests are fine (see TBC and Wrath). The rep grind requirements that started in Cataclysm and exist to this day are not. (yes in wrath there were two of said required rep grinds but one was done by doing ICC raid so it wasn't really THAT bad of one).  
---
5) This is item design not raid design. On that subject, TBC/Wrath item design is far superior to Vanilla design due to the fact you didn't have vastly lower ilvl items beating out end expac content for BIS. While I disagree with the current retail paradigm of "high ilvl = better" there comes a point at which a higher ilvl should be better.
---
6) See above. Also itemization that is good for you class is called good design (i.e. how very few tier pieces in vanilla are actually good for their class).  
---
7) Ganking will always favor the ganker. There's no balance here. Also balance shouldn't be around any particular preference of play as then it completely unbalances something else. Wanting "balance" in ganking style play is just like people who say "balance" should be around pve or 1v1s or arena or bgs. Balance is achieved by the players learning their class, having and using the correct consumables, and having the correct professions to fill in the gaps their class has. Note: balance != equality.
---
Used to play as a feral druid in TBC. Loved it, but you'll always lag behind an equivalent rogue. Having said that, the utility of being able to switch to bear is great! Prevented many wipes with a quick switch.
---
I think it's a lot more viable than people think.  The annoying part would be gearing.  Not only do you have everyone role rolling for the same gear, but for boomkins and feral a lot of it is off-set gear which limits the amount of viable pieces even more.  That being said, if you can gear for the stats (rather than the armor type being leather) then I think you'll have a lot less issues than people claim.  Fear mechanics are the one thing that would be hard to get around... Maybe a combo of pvp trinkets and kiting (kitty dash) would be able to pull it off?  Seems plausible but definitely harder than a normal raid.  I'd love to see it be done though!

Darkshore is a haven for xp, easy quick quests, etc. 
---
Also has the wand reward so if you're a caster speed leveling it's almost a must have.
---
This is the first guide I've seen while researching that doesn't praise darkshore as god.
---
No one said whose sunder it had to be
---
Strafing doesn't do the same thing, though. I can't just got the key to go in the direction I want, I have to turn perpendicular to the direction I want to go and keep turning back to face front every time my swing timer resets.
---
If I just want to adjust my position a little, or don't care about travel speed (the moon I'm fighting is going to die around the time I reach the next mob even if I'm moving at backpedal speed) I'm probably just going to use my s key.
---
Then again, I see what you mean by daze. You could strafe to kite and avoid some damage, while you're going to eat all those hits if you're backpedaling.

Weatfall might not be the most efficient, but hardly anyone will be there and I want to run deadmines. Deadmines overall has great quest rewards and lots of them.

Nope
---
Looks like an upvote party, Horde bros get in here. Alliance, we are at capacity.
---
Is there any particular reason as to why you need to be arms?
---
Fury will be higher dps, and also not take up a debuff slot, this in itself is reason enough.
---
You can compare this to firemages on fire immune bosses, they can still use frostbolts, but will deal lower damage than a frostspecced mage.
---
Bear form is best form.
---
To be honest, I was surprised with how much detail they were giving out in their earlier responses. I was thinking, "Man, they are really giving away all their secrets here..." Maybe someone caught on and decided they probably shouldn't be giving away all the ingredients.
---
Would arms at that point be considered trash though or could it still compete for mid table damage?
---
Oh my apologies. My mobile app didn't show that parent comment -\_-

Imagine thinking your personal experience accounts for anything objective.

But that's two weeks away o.O

Yea, it's more for PvP than anything else.

I told my girlfriend that she has full control of our leveling path except that we HAVE to do Duskwood. Other than that, I'm just going to watch her explore.

This subreddit has become absolute shit now that it's overrun by memes and YOU let this happen.
---
Nah I just like being excited about classic wow and it looks like other people agree. 
---
Sorry you’re mad.
---
Solution, never invite a hunter, I’m sure not bringing any.
---
Half true. Not all his content is old, just the class guides. And he makes new content so idk why you think all his content is old. The true part is that his content has inaccuracies. I mean it does. That's a contentious point there are some holes and inaccuracies.
---
Also long walks with nothing to do.
---
More work?
---
Are your mounts subprime?
---
I guess I was just focusing on pvp more with mortal strike, but you're right. In the end I'm just looking to play a spec that can warrant me getting a nice 2h really.
---
Making YouTube's or running an ad on a website helps get some money. But most do it as a passion to share information, getting some ad revenue back is just a bonus.
---
Some of them are. Why would you think speedrunning and shitposting are mutually exclusive?
---
I honestly don’t know exactly where arms would fall, but you have two big negatives at that point.
---
1. You are basically limiting your damage from what your maximum potential would be, which I acknowledge you said is not a priority for you, but others will care.
---
2. You are negatively impacting other dps classes by taking up debuff slots, which people will DEFINITELY care about.
---
For those reasons if I was the RL, or just as the warrior myself I would want you to play 2H fury.
---
Yes, let's just redefine two very simple things so that they appear to be the same, even though they clearly are not!  
---
An achievement is... an achievement.  BiS lists are a player-created list of information.  You can choose to work towards achievements if you want, or BiS items if you want, or neither if you want. Doesn't mean these things are similar or comparable at all..
---
Ok dude, you are clearly very upset because your favorite meme is not the most popular one, or maybe because you're old and malding so you feel insulted by "boomer".
---
But it's just literally the most spammed meme nowadays. Don't worry boomer, it will pass, people come up with something new that takes its place as always.
---
Joana and parent comment are the mentality that made vanilla great.  Build the community up, don't tear it down!
---
I am in my late 20s and have been playing WoW for years. It's pretty much the only game I can say my skills have not deteriorated. I'm way shittier at FPS games and I don't even bother with those tight control platformers.
---
I really can't imagine someone getting shittier at WoW with age, especially classic. It's like the game was designed for boomers who are bad at video games. Its so slow.
---
If you have a Priest Healer make sure they are not putting a bubble on you. Not taking damage prevents that much more rage from being built.
---
One of the key reasons I loved vanilla, and has me excited for Classic is the sense of community.
---
What I mean by that is people just randomly helping other people.  Running down a road, and having a rando high level run by the other direction and hit you with MotW/Thorns, Fortitude, or the like.  Arcane Intellect and you're a warrior? Hell, it's the thought that counts.
---
Also the cross-faction community. Sure, you're at war with the other faction, but there's been times (strangely, in STV) when I've been trying to kill an elite and the other faction rolls up.
---
I point to the guy, then point to the elite.  The other guy nods.  He tags first, I help kill it.  Then he points to the elite when it respawns, then points to me. I nod, I tag first, and he helps me kill it.  Then we go our separate ways.
---
Random high levels helping you do quests, or do a dungeon because you're stuck on a boss, or want a piece of gear that would be awesome. Just...people generally being awesome to each other.
---
Is it painful for the newly initiated? Oh hell yeah. But its the community that helps tie it all together and make it doable, to help the new folks learn and makes the community stronger, and builds those awesome relationships that last through the game, even beyond.
---
I'm excited about the game, but I'm also excited about the other people who are equally excited about it as I am, and there's a special part of me who loves imparting knowledge to newbros and oldbros alike who have questions about the game, how it plays, where to go for fun lore quests, etc.
---
Here is my [1-60 alliance leveling guide](https://sage-guide.netlify.com). You can use whatever parts you like and mix and match. By the end you will get your molten core attune, last quest in onyxia attune, scholomance key, blackrock depths key, exposure to uldaman, zul'farrak and blackrock depths and much more!
---
I’d love to read this post, can you link it please? I haven’t found it.
---
5 hrs was a somewhat arbitrary limit. I remember our clears taking maybe 2-3 hrs once the raid was firmly in farm status during vanilla.
---
Once you've decided what to play, how do you sick to that decision? I keep updating my decision. Alt or focus on main? Gathering prof only, or something useful like alchemy or enchanting? Level 35 craft/bank alt, or just level 5 bank alt that can disenchant?
---
I just can't keep my mind made up once I've decided.
---
There is literally everything that other spec/class can do better than enh sham so yes, saying enh is not competetive is 100% right
---
*charging in before tank gets back from bathroom break.
---
You are like my opposite haha. I use a razer naga with 12 side buttons, took a little bit to get used to it but I can never go back.
---
I don't think retail WoW can be saved, realistically, it took 10+ years to screw it up as bad as it is now, so it won't be quick to turn it all around, and I just don't think people will stick around when Blizzard gradually fixes a decade's worth of mistakes.
---
I hands down select my class/race on a huge part of how it looks aesthetically. 
---
But you also have to factor in the class/spec your playing and what goals you have at endgame. Im at a tossup right now betweem female tauren warrior and female tauren ele/resto sham.
---
My only issue is i really do not feel like spending the gold to respec every week from deep resto to ele resto. As a warrior i can just offtank/dps and collect my gear along the ride
---
Fuck you Corporal Upham. You cowardly shit.

I get so angry just thinking about that scene.

Nah, it's just that anecdotal "evidence" is a known fallacy. So is ad hominem. Congrats on objectively being an idiot though.

I would say shaman. It’ll be a more fun leveling experience in my opinion, more utility in terms of interrupts and shocks, and since no one in your group wears mail, you won’t be fighting for gear as much.
---
I was going to instantly upvote due to Wonder Years. Then I read it. I wish I could triple upvote.
---
Why..... This is the exact thing classic doesn't need.
---
How small an SSD are we talking? You can drop a 120-240 GB in for about $35 these days if you're pressed for storage and want to upgrade. Game is around 8 GB installed on beta client, for what it's worth.
---
Did you play on SH recently? I played on the SH launch as well as the Classic stress that happened just before. I was on server 15 which had a number of bigger streamers on it.
---
After both of those experiences, I can say that layering is SOOOOO much better than dynamic respawns. The important thing to note is that launch day dynamic respawns are far, far different to how they operate on say, ND or LB. On SH, mobs would respawn within 5 seconds of dying and a cleared-out area would have every mob respawn at the exact same time. It was total aids as a caster. You kill one guy and then go to pull the next one. By the time you finish your first cast, the guy you just killed has respawned is now whacking you. The only way to avoid this is to facepull mobs and fight them directly over their spawn point and then immediately run once you kill them. Feels really bad as mage and pre-10 druid. 
---
This isn't even the worst part about SH's launch day respawns. The worst part was how quickly bodies despawned. Bodies despawned in about 5 seconds so you had to loot an enemy. If you were fighting 2 mobs, you'd have to stop and loot the first one you killed or it would despawn by the time you killed the second. Maybe you kill 1 mob and you're low on health. Oh no, his buddy respawned and is coming at me. Welp, now you have to choose between quickly looting and maybe dying, or healing yourself to survive and lose a potential quest drop because the body will despawn before you're cast is finished. I lost numerous quest item drops to this - Timberlings in Teldrassil, Moonstalkers in Darkshore, Murlocs in Redridge. It was fucking awful.
---
Compare that to the layering of the stress test. Everything was smooth. I still saw a bunch of people in the starting area. I got ahead early and I still saw a bunch of people. I joined multiple groups and eventually ended up staying grouped with one guy from level 8-15. We regrouped the next day to do BGs, DM, and get our BiS. 
---
I never bothered grouping on SH because the fast respawns make it unnecessary. I never had any qualms about stealing a mob tag from someone because of the fast respawns. It made me an admittedly more toxic player. I was on the fence about layering until then but I'm now absolutely convinced that layering &gt; dynamic respawns for launch day congestion.
---
Not sure if it was intentional, but some parts of your post come across as rude - for example, "this reeks like argument from ignorance."  Other parts come across as a bit arrogant and condescending.
---
Anyway, thought I would like you know in case that wasn't your intent and there is a language barrier.  I generally ignore rude posts and posters.  Good luck with retail.
---
Especially these days
---
we are very tiny, one healing potion lasts for 5 heals  (we just take a little sip each time)
---
The OP mentions DM AoE/Tribute farms. This is a valid gold farming method, even if it's not in phase 1.
---
There might be some other method for phase 1 such as /BRD Incendius solo or farming the non-elite dog packs, but usually DM is better gold.
---
For one, bring back the old loot system.  When a few items drop that need to be distributed, it encourages guild play, since you'd rather at least the gear that drops go to people who will be in your next run than go to strangers.  When all gear is individual, there's less incentive not to just pug everything.
---
Delete flying mounts or turn them into ground only mounts.  Also probably honestly delete most of the later mounts, later on they added far too many humongous goofy mounts like the core hound mount.  Tone things down a bit.  But we need them to remove flying mounts so that world pvp is fun again.
---
Specific realms again, no x-server stuff.  Nothing pairs up with world pvp better than rivalries and even guild rivalries.
---
No more raid tiers.  Make progression feel linear.  And make the power levels between content not feel quite so extreme.  Make the power difference between expansions smaller.  Soloing raids should never be possible.  Items like Thunderfury were amazing for keeping older content alive for a long time, think of doing more low drop rate items that encourage guilds to continue running old stuff.  No catch up gear.
---
Stop balancing PVP only for arena, make the classes feel distinct again.  Arena will never be a serious esport and should just be for fun, and the emphasis on it destroys the fun of imba world pvp.
---
No daily quests.  It was more fun to farm gold when you had to figure out interesting strats to do it and execute them well.  Farming gold by logging in each day and doing repetitive stuff turns it instantly into a chore.
---
Last, less goofy quest chains which try to tell stories through cinematics or whatever.  Focus on making the player feel like a small part of a big world.
---
I played vanilla, I don't think they will.
---
First of all : congrats on the awesome job, and thank you from the community.
---
I was planning on following Joana's guide, but maybe ill use this one instead. Do you know if there are major differences between the two paths ? (Not talking about specific quests un particular, more like if you have to farm more in one or the other, if one includes some dungeon quests, etc)
---
I was a child back when I played and I was a pretty shitty person. Decided on rolling a priest in August to make up for my actions. Incoming Fort Buffs.
---
I hate this toxic community that retail has gotten.
---
An example, the other day i finally succeeded in getting one of my friends to try out WoW.  After 30min creating her perfect bloodelf hunter she began her journey.  
---
Here we are talking about a person that doesnt even know how to use a keyboard and mouse simulstaneously.
---
After not even an hour of playing she went to kill a guy for her quest, and as he dies some guy comes running, screaming "FUCK U" and "STUPID RETARD!" now she had no idea to why he behaved like so. So i had to explain that if he had come 2 second earlier he could have gotten the tag. Instead he now has to wait 10sec for a respawn... 
---
Shit like that is destroying the game for new players.  Because she felt like she did something wrong, or broke something.
---
Because Crul isn't a good main hand weapon due to the 2.3 AS. I'm comparing DeathBringer to those other two because Deathbringer will be the mainhand of choice for orc furies between Onyxia and Naxx. There is no other main hand axes to compare those two to outside of HWL weapons. If I'm comparing AQR or CTS to Crul I'll say that either of the former are better MH weapons.
---
Edgemasters aren't mandatory for orcs, but they will still be BiS because even beyond the first 5 (which as we've learned recently is by far the most important aspect of weapon skill) increasing glancing blow damage is a huge DPS increase, far better than the 1 crit and 14 AP you get from devilsaur compared to Titanic Leggings and Edgemasters.
---
Green names are horde player.

As usual josh amazing podcast. My family just built a new house down the shore over here in New Jersey. So on my  commute down i listened to this episode. So interesting to hear about kara. And the perspective of to old war dogs of the top guilds back in the day.
---
if you were slick enough and had a friend or 2 killing level 60s was easy even at lower levels i remember me and 2 shamans all in our levels 30s used to harass and kill levels 60 lile we were the otters fromthe planet earth river episode.
---
Thank you for the heads up! You've quelled my worries then :)
---
This should be removed as a low effort post. All the information is false.
---
I've coded a little app to replicate the launch. When I first go to login I start the app and it tells me how long the queue is and then keeps throwing out random times for when I'll be able to actually connect. 
---
Once that's down I can actually login on my PC. But the app keeps running and at random times it tells me I've been disconnected.
---
Then I have to go back to step one. It's going to be glorious.
---
Another one of those post that just ruins your day.. let's hope I don't get remembered tomorrow about having to wait over a month still.
---
Not exactly what you asked but several classes should be making some macros early. For example adding start attack to heroic strike.
---
I don't treat spending time with my family as a bad thing. So no, why would it be terrible?
---
Best of luck to you living on that pension.
---
Cap for glancing blow reduction is 308 weapon skill from beta tests. So no, they will not wear edgemasters and they will not be BiS. Crul is better than CTS if you have axe specialization. Being a slow weapon doesn't make it bad. You get less parry haste!
---
If it the same as the last stress test then you will need an active sub to participate.
---
Terrible, don't play one. 
---
I'm playing one.
---
Swobu
---
Sorry for ruining your day, but rejoice for your days won't be ruined for long!!
---
This is what I'm predicting too.  There's gonna be such a drastic difference between what players who were in classic remember, and what it will be like with the newer internet gaming culture there alongside all of it.  
---
Does blizzard have any plans to do anything differently about recipes and AQ resource unlock?  Or will everyone be able to farm mats for the most expensive items/grinds from Day 1, far earlier than compared to how it when in Vanilla?  Or will players be gutting the economy from the get-go?
---
This is one of the problems I find playing as a Horde hunter and wanting to level in Tristfal Glades. No Hunter trainer. Need to fly/hearth back to train and do hunter quest.
---
There's probably a subreddit for upham hate by now.
---
Dragonstalker, bright without going overboard and easily recognizable.
---
Throw a Rhok'delar on there, and you've got the *look*.
---
I would recommend searching the sub, there have been many of these posts even today.
---
But to summarize:
---
PvE: start strong but don’t scale well, ranged weapons are sparse in raids
---
PvP: Pretty good, not overly difficult to play but high skill cap to maximize
---
Yeah 100% worth it. I wouldn't have had them if I was just going to ignore them.
---
Not long.. not long he says! Can you believe this guy..
---
Love the 90's movies memes.  You can definitely tell by just scrolling through this subreddit that the community demographic are 80's'-90's babies just by the stuff they reference.
---
This is wonderful work - thank you
---
Please don't haha - so undeserving
---
Character progression and BiS lists are, at their core, a goal to strive for. Hopefully we can agree on that. 
---
Achievements are goals to complete. Nothing more than that.
---
They are both in game goals that require effort on your end to complete. The end result is a player sense of accomplishment. 
---
For you to say they are different is for you to either argue that either
---
- A: Once of them is in fact not a goal, therefore they are not similar
---
- B: You're set of goals in regards to character progression are more important than somebody else' set of goals and therefore their goals should not even be recognized in the game.
---
You still avoided my question I see. **As long as they aren't public why do you give a shit if there is an achievement list in the game you never have to even open if you don't want to?** If they aren't public it is nothing more than a UI change.
---
Make Azeroth Great Again!
---
every raid needs 1 or 2. They're solid in dungeons. Their dps starts off fairly high but trails off as they don't scale as well as mages or warriors as raids go on. Overall useful for pulls and tranq shot.   
---
Very good pvp, both bgs and open world. Fine on their own or in premades.
---
Great for everything except later raids. Great in BG's open world. Best leveling class and integral for 5 man dungeons. Assuming your above average of course. You need to be skilled for any of that to be true.
---
but can relationships to guild members actually grow to close friendship, like on common language servers?
---
I get it dude, you're desperate for attention. With your personality you might even win the attention olympics.
---
Now shut the fuck up.
---
My whole first day of play was getting through the starting zone, running up the main path to the gates of Stormwind only to be stopped by some random level 30 something Druid.  I remember him asking me if I was just starting along with some other casual banter.  After our quick conversation, he decided to take me out and show me the world on foot.  We traveled from the gates of Stormwind all the way through wetlands and into arathi, all on foot.  Overall, he spent about 4-5 hours showing me parts of Azeroth and as boring as it sounded, this is my fondest memory of the game.
---
Leveling they're gods...
---
In late game 5 man's they're a mid-tier class. They can make some pulls easier and make holding aggro better because they just feign death all day.
---
In terms of raiding they are there because Tranq Shot and you only bring the two or three needed for Tranq Shot rotations. Their DPS is absolutely hot garbage but that's better than the cold garbage of Shamans.
---
(They do less damage than a ret paladin so I'll let that sink in.)
---
PvP they're fine too. The kiting ability and utility brought make them these cunning handlers and have okay burst. I love them but there are definitely better classes.
---
Overall Grade: C+ class.
---
They already have their first raid past Naxx: Karazhan, just retuned to level 60.  Kara fits perfectly into the theme of classic and everyone loves it.
---
The Maury and Jerry Springer shows would suggest otherwise.
---
You can always find another wife and have more children.  If you had planned ahead you could have had a whole team of toddler gold farmers ready to go by now.
---
When's the last time you played retail? The last two expansions didn't allow flying mounts until late content patches, and you had to do the equivalent of a feat of strength achievement to unlock it.
---
Sorry, alliance.
---
Barrens chat is immortalized as a deity that your sorry asses can never reproduce.
---
This man speaks the truth.
---
Its not meant to be rude, its a little bit of a language issue, im no native speaker, but i thought "argument from ignorance" is a valid point to make since im 99% sure OP hasnt touched the content or has no intention to gather some infos on it
---
Man, being a warrior and constantly being duel requested by mages must be quite triggering.
---
I don't think this is an age thing (re: "younger generations" ragequitting). 
---
Some people are going to have fun with the challenge of planning out your kills and how to get out of scrapes in the open world, and some people are not. I don't see what age has to do with it at all.
---
Where you from? Your English is pretty great man.

wtf man

oh shit, that makes sense lmao
---
She died bro
---
Many...MANY years and I can still hear it
---
You'll probably get a lot of the quests done while leveling. If you go back as a 60 to finish up any quests you missed, you'll finish them quickly.
---
I don't think that completing every quest in vanilla is that bad, especially if you just do it a little bit at a time.
---
Mmm, reposts..
---
[According to this thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/) I'm wrong, too. Revenge does a lot more threat. I guess you shouldn't be afraid to Shield Block and Revenge.
---
**As long as they aren't public why do you give a shit if there is an achievement list in the game you never have to even open if you don't want to?**
---
I love these sort of stories.  Damn, my popcorn is all gone.
---
How many hits are furies parrying in raids? CTS top end is still higher than Crul despite significantly lower DPS. Larger benefit from WF and bigger cleaves and Whirlwinds.
---
Did not know about 308 glancing cap in beta, that's good to know. I appreciate the new knowledge.
---
If only Maladath and Anubisath gave +5 to weapon skill instead of +4...
---
I still feel like my major takeaway that choosing non-orc for Horde is far less of a handicap than choosing non-human for alliance in a raid environment.
---
Wishing that the leaf drops instead of the eye of divinity
---
This is the mistake I made a decade or more ago - I told her how to play. It immediately killed her interest.
---
Legendary gear scale similar to heirloom Gear.  
---
Make leveling mean something, not simply a means to an end.  
---
Look at the itemization as it existed in 60 and 70 wow. Due to the difficulty, there was always some way outside of raid you could be looking to upgrade something.  
---
Honestly, I think going back to the drawing board and shooting the lame horse is the only real way.
---
Least he has the class right, anyone that wants to be top dps is going to roll Fury smh...
---
Well, If you consider her an equal, treat her like one.  Did you need to have the controls explained to you?
---
Why can't you just let her play and if she asks for help, help her?
---
Easy peasy
---
Free action pot a day keeps the mages away.

---
What do you mean by take warriors just to be the guy with bre? Obviously the warriors are getting the BRE and Bre is amazing for 2hand fury. Don't expect to just join a guild and get a free bre is that's what you mean
---
The economies I believe, will be fucked.  Knowledge of what was needed wasn't released all at once back in the day.  Patches came out, items added, things changed, dungeons and raids and factions added later...  People from day 1 are gonna be gouging the markets and it might end up being worse than originally, ie money was super rare and hard to save.  
---
I don't know how many will want to do what it takes to be truly self sufficient in Classic.

Why would they have to do maintenance on servers that aren't even running?
---
I don't agree. I prefer how survival is in early wow. Better traps, great survivability tools, and crit chance. 
---
It is the same "spec identity vs class identity" argument. A hunter should feel like a hunter imo.
---
You don't have unlimited shooting range like retail.
---
Many hunters will be shocked when they can't shoot someone that's up in their face.
---
As long as you are okay with that - hunters are fine and you should roll it.
---
As you wish.
---
I think an apocalypse server, which exists for a set period of time and then wipes, is an intriguing idea to generate races to world first and so forth.  Existing characters could get sent to an evergreen server at reset.  However. I wouldn't ask developers to think about it now.  They need to focus on the task at hand... get classic right.
---
I've heard you can get an IV drip of meth, cocaine and caffeine mixed (called an 'arcane bomb') that will keep you leveling for 72 hours straight, guaranteed.
---
Who the hell honestly cares what some neckbeard on the internet thinks?
---
Play the game to your own accord and have fun.
---
Exactly, I dont know where all this "You cant Pot in a duel! Noob!" rules came from, there are no rules in a duel, 2 people enter 1 person walks away thats it lol
---
Do you want to be an efficient and safe leveler? Hunter is great for that. Anything else in the game they are doom tier.
---
I get what your saying, but doesn’t that apply to other classes as well?
---
Are warriors not expected to tank? Aren’t priests expected to heal?
---
Your only making yourself look worse buddy.
---
You can stay at the maximum range of a caster and as a druid using root/travel form kite out of their casting range while your dots are ticking and heal yourself. Soda wins those duels through a war of attrition with this style of play.

Ps tip your mages at the end really made me lol. Sorry for low effort comment
---
Why aren't y'all playing Everquest progression?
---
Yea I think Blizz knew how OP +5 weapon skill is so they didn't do it.
---
"CTS top end is still higher than Crul despite significantly lower DPS. Larger benefit from WF and bigger cleaves and Whirlwinds."
---
Sure, but top end isn't everything, or we would all be 2 handing. Id MH Crul over DB, but DB is actually really good still.
---
I mean, is it surprising? Just look at this place. Look at official forums. Look at /r/wow.
---
People like to talk about the community that classic had/will bring back but I honestly believe it was just as much, if not more, a product of the times and infancy of MMOs/online gaming environment in general that facilitated that friendly, tight-knit community than anything inherent to the actual game; and those times are long gone.
---
You easily get 3 sunders per mob at level 10+

HS not only costs rage, but stops you generating rage on that auto. 3x sunder = 3 more chances to proc overpower which is your best damage ability until ww at 36

Regardless of whether achievements are in the game or not, why can't you just make an accurate comparison so your argument actually means something?
---
Had a good argument until ‘they grief with class’.
---
"Being kind to new people" is not how I would describe my experience being in Tarren Mill while it was being raided back in the day.
---
Son... I'm about to tell you the greatest story ever told!
---
very funny video !
---
PVP isn't really impacted that much, you'll be fine.
---
I think it's a lot less viable than you think.
---
If all you care about is pvp, there is no fall off. t2.5 and 3 are both pretty nice pvp sets and aq40 and naxx have huge pvp weapon upgrades
---
Couldn’t quite put my finger on my thoughts till I read your comment.  Very accurate comparison imo.
---
ZUG ZUG Y'ALL!
---
The glaringly obvious problem with these remodels is they forget to design the world using asymmetrical assets.  Thats what makes classic wow stand out from other games.   The buildings and assets in classic look quirky and asymmetrical.  These new engine remodels lack that touch and character.
---
You can set your hearthstone to Razor Hill, run to Mulgore and level. Then hearth back do your thing and then fly back.
---
XD
---
That's sounds awesome!
---
Yes. Not the entire naxx in vanilla but most of it. Again they WERE hard. These days even heroic raids are harder than Naxx and AQ40 were. I can guarantee you it won't take "hundreds of hours" for people to clear them in classic. It doesn't even take hundreds of hours in retail where the raids are by far much harder.
---
I can help you out. I'm a vet and very skilled ☺❤
---
too soon, wait 2 more years
---
Just because flying isn't available from the offset in the most recent added continent, does not mean that the issue in no longer present. Flying is still available in all other areas of the game and after a duration, it is then full available across the whole game. Ergo, flying is still a persistent mechanic.
---
You will tank with daggers in P1 and P2, P5 and P6, if you dont have TF and with TF if you have that and in P6 you can tank with THC as well. P3 and P4 and during AQ40 progression - so during BWL farming and AQ40 progression you can tank with a Crul (and DE during BWL progression). So you wont tank with an Axe for the majority of classic - even as an orc. Depending on when they add bindings to the MC loottable, MTs of early on MC farming guilds will easily have their TF once you step foot into AQ, therefore reducing the usage of Crul (the only decent endgame tankaxe) even more. So for the real hard content you end up using Aged Core Leather Gloves and daggers. For that the Orc racial doesnt help you. Therefore the 5% HP of the Tauren are better if you put it into perspective of the whole classic lifetime. (Yes Orcs are better for the scenario I outlined but that is it.)
---
This needs to be said more, but people who are either extremely casual or just don't have a clue how the end game really plays just dismiss this...They are doing a disservice to a lot of people by not mentioning this, it is what it is I guess.
---
I was in a guild in Vanilla  that cleared up to Naxx. We had 2-4 active ele shamans that weren't healing. I wasn't one of them so I cant remember the exact numbers.
---
Just saying.
---
I've played many new games where friends would explain the basics to me prior to playing the game.   I'm sure everyone else has done the same.  This whole advocating for coddling because OP might lose his chance is pathetic.  
---
Don't hover and have her excitement really be just feeding off your own.
---
Teach basics, controls are basic, and let them go.  Which, is what I said in the beginning.
---
Goes double for gnomes. I don't care how small you are, we're at capacity Fam
---
Think of what percentage of encounters you survive having at some point dropped below 5% health as a tank. Tauren is that percentage better. As 5% bonus health only matters if you drop into that extra pool it creates.
---
The crossroads is under attack...
---
Its always under attack.
---
Every minute of every day.
---
The crossroads is under attack.
---
SPEAK
---
While I appreciate the post - those were different times where - yes optimization was a thing back then but there wasn't as big of a "hardcore" mindset.
---
Today in 2019 (yes NOT every guild is like this) - why would we being x, y or z if they are going to do less overall damage, threat or heals. We want to spend the least amount of time in raids each week so we can do other things.
---
So while those subpar specs will be playable - it's good to let people that have never played Vanilla that there are specs that will be laughed at.
---
It's not to tear them down - it's just a heads up.
---
Warriors are also the best dps class in the game, so i mean..
---
The debuff slot is a big deal. Many people are fine with meme specs because they just contribute a bit less.
---
Arms is actively hurting the raid by taking a debuff slot.
---
Warriors can easily top DPS meters.
---
Then he vanish but your deep wounds ticks him out as you resist his kidney shot to heroic strike crit him dead
---
Minimum character level is 5 to pick up professions. 
---
Then I think you need 75 skill in a profession to level up to artisan.
---
Dabu
---
I've personally saved many an Orc Warrior with my rank 4 lesser healing wave.
---
I still view hybrids as healers who can do other things. It’s fun playing resto in vanilla because you still have your class abilities. 
---
If you’re the type of person who cares about being dps just play a class that does good dps.
---
Get rid of lfg stuff, dailys, grinding resources/whatever and make the game actually difficult again.
---
seeing the LocalDefense message is so exciting, especially on contested zones.
---
Yup you can't learn 300 tailoring on a level 1.
---
There's like 100 things about classic I could change that would make it a better game, but I think it's a bit of a slippery slope. #Nochanges and all that. I think it's a bit hypocritical to ask for classic WoW and then ask that the very base mechanics of the game be changed because people got used to it the other way on private servers and conflated that experience with their memory of classic.
---
For every time it sucked being that Mage there are 10 times it sucked being melee unable to hit the enemy because of their (or your) latency.
---
Here's my problem. I'm torn between these two games and don't know which to play. Not because I love them both, but because they're both extremely flawed.
---
On one hand, there's retail. Or as it's called, World of Chorecraft: Beta for Azeroth. Works quests, dailies, emissaries, mythic plus. I feel like if I'm not playing a billion hours a day I'm falling behind. I'm tired of dailies. I log on, look at the list and log off. I'm only doing them now just to get flying and then I'll probably stop again. I don't raid competitively anymore so getting into dungeon groups is extremely difficult because of my lower gear level. As far as the story for, some people hate it. I don't. I've always liked Jaina as a character and am happy they're finally doing something with her. But I can get all that with cutscenes on YouTube, so playing isn't required. Also, is just a single player game now in a lot of ways. I like the change with War Mode being a thing. My friends want to play on a PvP server, but I don't. We can stay all on the same server and we're all happy. In Vanilla either I'm pissed or they're bored. I like that there's always new stuff every few months.
---
On the other hand there's Vanilla. High on the adventure and MMO aspect of the genre. However, Class Design and Class Balance were fucking atrocious back then. I don't like being told that I *have* to ball because I'm a priest, or that I can't tank because I'm a paladin, it that I can't DPS because I'm a druid or shaman or whatever, plus issues with multiple other specs that are simply unplayable. Not to mention the retarded debuff slot limit. Makes the game not fun when your choices are so limited. At heart on retail I can play whatever I want, have the potential for success and not be looked down on. And most of the specs that were good are just one or two button spam fests. Very boring to play. Plus there's also that the game has been "solved" so there's really no interesting things to discover. It's all been done multiple times over. 
---
So instead of a choice between which to play, I find myself deciding if I really want to play *either* of them. Not sure where to go from here.
---
I dont understand when people say you get tons  more survivability as resto PVP, outside of natures swiftness every 3min i really dont see how.  Hearth Of The Wild is crazy for survivability specially in bear form and its not a cooldown its a passive effect.   
---
From the healing tree youll only get 15% more rejuv healing and 10% more overall healing.  But youll already get a lot of healing from the PVP gear alone.
---
"Powershifting" is literally just what you said.  Shifting in and out of cat form between energy ticks so that you get the 40 from furor in the resto tree, 20 from the wolfshead helm, and 20 from an energy tick for total 80 energy which is enough for two shreds.
---
At first I thought this was that painting of Orgrimmar that keeps getting reposted and I was mad lol.
---
Holy shit numpad marking/tagging hotkeys? Did you just change my life?
---
For full clears it's a lot less viable, I don't disagree with that.  I think they have a decent shot at clearing some bosses if they avoid those with certain mechanics.  I think it would be hard to keep the guild together for any long duration though because the lack of completing raids and competition for gear would cause a lot to leave.
---
LMFAO
---
PvE server. Leave her alone for the most part, but pop in occasionally and ask how she's doing and if she has any questions.
---
Why do you have to tank with Daggers in P1 and P2 instead of Deathbringer ? Having actual tanking gloves on is a big advantage.
---
Saying someone will easily have TF by AQ is a tall order. Many tanks will not. Its just RNG and its not even close to a guaranteed TF by AQ.
---
Oui!
---
&gt; people claim it was pivotal to PvP
---
Well...  It's pivotal to a re-creation of vanilla's pvp.  I wouldn't say it's pivotal to PVP in general, but changing it would change the game relative to how it was in classic.  Whether or not that's worth doing is a separate conversation, it's essentially a question of class balance.

More fun itemization, stuff with uses and unique procs that maybe scale with something to make crazy builds possible. also not have every item be optimizied. Auras and totems should be party wide in a raid setting giving them space to be more impactful and fun. Just two small points i think are very important
---
Sigh...another post pushing me away from wanting to be a Druid...
---
I need help!
---
Damn, je m’apelle Baguette!
---
Ignoring whatever tf "Doom tier" means, Hunters are one of the best PVP classes in the game. This post is pretty misinformed.
---
Local stormwind was always the most active on my server.
---
Hard to be the most effective PvP class when all our CC drs with each other and our kiting ability has been hurt significantly
---
i had a similar problem with chain heal ... having like 40% crit meant that an early crit on the tanks lead to a raid wipe
---
I didn't play alliance so I dont know about Paladins much. :)
---
Had mount on mousewheel click so I can travel with one hand and smoke with the other
---
I remember my ping being around 60-100ms on some servers for me back in the day. Today, even though my internet is 100x faster and way more reliable, my ping is still around 50-100\~ ish to most servers and other games I play.   
---
   
---
With various players playing from all across the world on various pc hardware and internet quality and speeds there will never a blanket solution for everyone.  
---
Hopefully, this latency compensation is something Blizzard will monitor and can make adjustment if needed. I wonder if this is something that can be adjusted per server?  
---
Yes, internet and server technology has come a long way since 2004 but I still have disconnects,lag,long delays on actions, "must get closer to the target-Target not in range" messages on and on, mostly the same problems we have had with online gaming still exists, of course nowhere near as bad or as frequent(for me at least).
---
&gt;OP: Asks about class and spec viability.
---
&gt;OP: Complains when people talk about the necessary things to make the class viable.
---
Did you actually want an answer or did you just want someone to say, "Yes, they're viable," to give you confirmation bias?
---
EVERYTHING. Please prove it. bc purely based off of totems alone (which separate shamans from other classes) enhancement shamans are the best shamans to bring to a melee group, which you already put a shaman in the melee group. Therefor it is competitive.
---
&gt; Hard to be the most effective PvP class when all our CC drs with each other and our kiting ability has been hurt significantly
---
Exactly like it was in 2006, you mean? Nothing has been nerfed you just played on the nost core for too long.
---
Which makes no sense since we are all 15 YEARS OLDER since vanilla. You would think there would be some growing up that occurred.
---
I haven't played WoW in quite many years now (basically since mid wotlk), so I'm not exactly sure what you mean when you say "playing the patch instead of the expansion".
---
Are patches these days created so all other previous patches - and thus BiS gear - becomes irrelevant as soon as the new patch is available, and you can just skip all content to go to the newest raid instance?
---
I would really like to play latest wow and new content rather than classic. But classic style of game appeals to me more than retail. I will play classic anyway because i dont have any real choice.
---
But i dont want to play classic forever and i wont certainly play current retail anymore.
---
Tier 0. It's identical to Tier 0.5, just with a different shade. But tier 0 looks better on shamans than 0.5 imo.
---
Tier 0. Final answer!
---
You are in for a treat. I wish I could go back.
---
At first this struck me as looking very "Skyrim" and really want appealing to me. 
---
But by the end, showing off OG, looked pretty cool. 
---
I'd love to see character models in action to get a true sense if I would actually want to play something like this.
---
8.2 seems pretty good actually. An elite in Naz’ajatar was actually difficult and had group wiping mechanics, I had to group up with a few people in the area and teach them the mechanics  just to take it down. Was a lot more fun than the run up pop CDs get azerite.
---
Meant it more along the lines of if I already having it. I've heard other classes can have it as an applicator but if I did, is that definitely enough to get a raid spot.
---
May the eternal sun shine upon thee.
---
This is exactly what I plan on doing for endgame in classic.  I'm going to go HotW resto spec to tank dungeons and heal raids and still be viable in PvP.  Once I carve out a niche as a good tank in my guild I can start off tanking raids.  If not, no big deal.  I can still heal no matter what.
---
I see what you’re saying.  You’re not talking about the players play style, but the difficulty of the game itself.  Got it.
---
I don't know why hunters specifically would quit the game more than any other class after AQ, not really sure what you're asking.
---
This is just.... wrong
---
You completely pulled this memory out of your ass! (No offense!)
---

Work work
---
The answer is complicated.  Druids can dps in 5 man instances just fine, feral or moonkin.  In 40 man raids they will be average dps or lower, however either spec provides a 3% crit chance aura to melee or casters.  Of course you won't likely be raiding for quite awhile.  As for moonkin going oom, yes they do.  You do have innervate, but in raids that's usually going to a healer or even a mage.  Still, a moonkin can do quite a lot of damage with a full mana pool.  Another thing to consider is that druids get 2 damage spell upgrades when AQ20 is released.  They get a rank 60 ferocious bite, and a rank 60 starfire.  These can help a lot with dps, especially starfire.  Druids are great in smaller raids like ZG or AQ where their utility is more impactful.
---
There was definitely a hardcore mindset, I was using spreadsheets for min/max and everyone was expected to. I think if anything now it’s less because there’s less to think about
---
Haha so the shaman 0? Ever class has a 0 and 0.5
---
Skill trees. I like being special(ised), even if it’s useless.
---
Oh, I've decided at least a dozen times.
---
If you want to call the BiS weapon for feral druids a meme, then OK.
---
I don't think the threat benefits of going from 2.3 speed to 1.8 speed outweigh the benefits of having BiS gloves on. You get like 20% more heroic strikes that do less damage. With flurry up, the gap is smaller. I'll math it later. But I feel like you are getting a small threat increase at the cost of wearing better gloves, and you may not even be getting a threat increase if you have Gauntlets of Anni or sacrificial. Once you get T3 gloves, you aren't gonna want to wear leather.
---
Many bosses in Naxx, you simply will not wear your leather gloves.
---
Anybody want a peanut?
---
I’ve played prot pally in retail for almost 12 years. However I’ve heard In classic they weren’t that good and the only real tanks are warriors. Paladins are just turned into healbots. Do I need to play warrior to have a hope of tanking?
---
It largely depends on if you can get the extra +5 weapon skill from the gloves in MC; that along with increased stats as you gear up makes dagger very strong from my exp
---
The reason why people ask questions here is because this is a community they want to be part of. It's better to ask something to a friend then to Google it.
---
It launches august 27th.  The beta test is just finishing up.
---
Yet I read 23 guild cleared naxx in vanilla.
---
New drops invalidating earlier content is a real sour apple. Even as good as TBC was, it happened here 100%. I have never once raided SSC or TK when it was relevant, because I would just straight up skip to BT. Catch up gear destroys and invalidates earlier content. You wouldn't have to rush out so many raids all the time if people actually had to play through them to reach the next one.
---
When I want to play Naxx I dont just skip MC or BWL. I have to gear up, progress through the raids and eventually end up at my goal. Not just lol enter raid farm first 3 bosses until geared enough to actually take it on for real.
---
And this is a problem in every single expansion, even TBC.
---
I already know that when TBC classic servers come out eventually, I absolutely have to stay are the forefront of raiding at all times because the moment BT comes out, SSC will never be run - ever again.
---
How would she - shes beaten to a bloody pulp
---
If you're going to use the item, you're not a ninja looter. It doesn't matter if others have low opinions of your choice.
---
I really doubt they would do that to MCP since it's considered the main way for feral DPS to be viable.  It isn't used by other classes and only affects feral endgame.  Nerfing it would make feral DPS not viable and I really doubt they'd make MORE specs not viable.
---
Anybody seen Rexxar?
---
Didnt watch it but its weak auras 100%
---
Also that playing a hybrid class out of your tier set will cause loot drama. You will also be put second for loot as a hybrid as most guilds would not let you roll main spec for a piece of rogue, warrior or mage gear. This makes it much harder to gear up and makes the game harder to play for yourself by trying to play outside of your tier set. By the time you do get the second hand off spec rolls for your main spec, your guild will most likely be tiered out already. This means your guild will be ready to move onto the next raid tier while you are still trying to gear up your hybrid and still lack the gear needed to move ahead with them as it took you way longer to gear up than it did for the rest of your guild.
---
A lot of gamers are either anxious edgy teens or frustrated neckbeards and are really quick to get annoyed and rage at people. That's why you just /ignore and don't bother wasting mental energy on them.
---
Yes you totally will wear ACLG...
---
Ya kind of. Best story I read have is I've taken illusionary rod as enhance because it's just an amazing weapon to level with and leveling feels more open to these interpretations. I don't feel the same way about max level. Especially something so very obviously not made for your spec. But I'm a little mixed on what I will find to be "ninja" looting and what the community will decide is the norm.
---
Because the content was extremely hard and 2.0 came out about a year later. Clearing trash with full tier 2 raiders was difficult. Blizzard literally made it too hard to clear
---
Oh yeah. I don't doubt the negative impacts created by this "solution". I guess a server to server chat that allows you to communicate in hopes of making a group to do dungeons would be the best solution. Basically replacing LFG with the ability to do your own "LFG".
---
Why?  Two to three crits/crush in a row and your MT dies and the raid wipes.
---
If she decides to keep playing her starter character until 20 and wants to play classic, we will definitely be playing together and I’ll give a follow up. 
---
The first time she was introduced to the game was last night and I’m ecstatic at how well it went.
---
Stahted iiiiin the vahleeee now we’re sooooo. freakin’. here.
---
OH MY BOSH
---
Big reports intensifies.
---
Every buff application should cause a bit of threat. I don't see why that would not work that way in classic.
---
I remember clearly trolling our main tanks by casting class buffs on pulls as a paladin in vanilla (it caused quite a bit of threat).
---
Fun fact Slam resets your auto attack, if that wasn't for that it would be brokenly good.
---
Not today.
---
Nvm, wrong thread.
---
Ninja looter is someone who breaks loot rules.
---
If loot rules say "Need before greed", then needing on an item you plan to sell is ninjaing.
---
If loot rules say "we all roll, winner gets it", but you are master looter and assign it to your friend (whether he needs it or not is irrelevant) without rolling, you are a ninja looter.
---
Are you doing a dungeon, and set master looter for last boss without your party noticing, just so you can steal some drop from it? Then you are a ninja looter.
---
Etc
---
Its not about what you plan to do with item, but rather about the agreed upon rules (which USUALLY imply "needing" the item to equip).
---
I don't recall what item I replaced, but iirc I believe I considered it a substantial upgrade at the time.
---
Call the brute squad!
---
Lots of this stuff only applies to raids. Dungeons are a different deal and most things are viable.
---
You'll tank dungeons just fine. They are behind druid and paladin tanks, but every group needs a tank so they'll be happy to have you.
---
If you dont think you can kite a caster by using their max casting range in a duel then idk what to tell you thats just a fact. Soda does it a lot but also mages do it (venruki) with nova/frostbolts to evocate or to eat/drink.
---
Your just wrong
---
Lmao pvp and raid design are the only 2 things good about wow and u want to change that? Suck my ass.
---
&gt; Dagger is always worse. 
---
False.
---
So your argument is that you will use armaments for dagger tanks, not Qiraji Axe, but you won't give any axe to a tank because there aren't enough axes? That doesn't really add up. Yea, loot is tough. But you can farm Onyxia by abusing reset lockouts and get deathbringers for everyone. You can't do that with daggers. 
---
The argument that you might get parry/dodged at the start is weak. If you get parry dodged in daggers you may also be losing aggro. Your extra heroic strike isn't going to hold aggro on it's own. If your BT/SS and sunder both didn't land, you might be in trouble either way.
---
But yea, depending on your guild and rng, you might end up stuck on daggers.
---
TBC arena balance was better than people give it credit for, actually. You could get glad with pretty much any class/spec (well, other than tank specs), granted some were easier and had a wider range of potential teammates (cough resto druid, cough warlock) but it was an acceptable range of inbalance. 
---
The only argument I can get behind is not making arena rewards superior to other rewards. Because I do agree that that creates a problem where people don't care as much about BGs, when for some people BGs are their favorite thing. Also the PvP weapons were too good (although this was a problem in vanilla too, so)
---
Basically... everything.
---
I just logged out of BFA (they gave me a 3 day free gift). I tried to be fair and give it another chance. But all it did was make me crave Classic even more.
---
Hi I will be playing on a PvP EU english realm, will leveling as feral of course and thinking playing a hybrid build at 60 lvl. Thinking of 19/11/21, coz I would like to have the feral charge but also thinking of moonglow/Nature's swiftness too. What about you?
---
why is this one so popular? i hear everyone talking about it, i think i used xperl back in the day
---
My layout is similar, but I have SS, Evis, and SnD on Q, E, and R respectively. Try Kick and Blind (or a mouseover macro of Blind) on scrollwheel up and down. 
---
I also don't use the F keys, I'm more comfortable with Shift and Alt variants of everything, but that's just personal preference.
---
Lok-Narash!
---
If it was really more fun there wouldn't need to be posts begging people to heal all the time
---
You have a really screwed perspective on whats the deciding factor - 0.5 sec isnt, but 500 armor is?
---
Altoholism. Going to binge on it. Until I tip over and pass out under the desk. All the classes, all the professions. It will be glorious. 
---
(Ok, I lied a bit, I don’t really enjoy druids or warlocks, and shamans are no-go for my faction, but you get the idea).
---
because a group of NE would could ambush a paladin ...
---
Level together in the undead starting zone
---
Hunters are *DOOMED*/10.
---
Jokes aside, S-tier levelers, really good damage and utility in dungeons (though it's easy to fuck up by pulling extra packs with pet or break CC with multi-shot), a hunter is pretty much mandatory for UBRS. 
---
Good and competitive DPS early raids, falls off in later tiers due to lack of upgrades/scaling, can still output decent numbers but everyone else should be ahead of you. Usually 2-4 raid spots by MC and 1-2 raid spots by Naxx.
---
Really good in PVP, top-tier for open world because they have practically wallhacks via minimap tracking. Really good in BGs, top-tier base sitters, can easily find the enemy FC and call out incs via tracking, also viper sting.
---
Wanted for premades, good utility all-around. Good burst damage, good peels, expect to be on defense of either your FR, FC or a base in AB most of the time though.
---
--
---
Just need some more bug fixes so that the mess that is pet AI gets better.
---
So you want people to comment on their viability, but don't want people to tell you how they aren't viable?
---
I'm still trying to understand.
---
The slower pacing. Content buckets (it's better than no patch progression at all!). Pre-BG wPvP. Vanilla AV (even if it's not quite the version I wanted) and the PvP ladder.
---
Accomplishments. Earning things. Server-specific communities.
---
The vanilla quests and storylines coming back.
---
That's not ninja looting but poor etiquette.
---
The other examples are also not ninja looting.  
---
If I was a warrior who rolled need on the staff to vendor it then I am ninja.  One of the best examples I can think of was when a priest rolled need on a felstriker because he didn't like the rogue in the ubrs group.
---
In the same way you can't perfectly run around a round object or corner while selecting different targets with strafe so they both have their dis/advantages. I tried both options in arena but keyturning was way better for me as a resto druid than strafing.
---
In pve I don't see how it ever had any impact on me as a tank, dps or healer but I didn't use mouseover macros.
---
From Sun tzu, Art of war 
---
I don’t mind explaining a fight but if you do the same mistake over and over and don’t listen then there is no point.

---
It's going to harm rogues DPS too.  So maybe warriors will be 2nd to mages?
---
Everyone is trying to get through to you, but it doesn't seem to be working. I'll try also:  
---
Your underlying assumption is that playing the game better (from a PvE or PvP view) is good or desired. This isn't true for everyone. Improving at the mechanics or execution is not an unflinching goal, especially in a game that's not really skill based (like an MMO). A lot of people enjoy the game through roleplay, exploration, simply experiencing the lore, and working through the game at their own pace. 
---
Forcing them to develop skills they don't care about because "it'll make the game better for you, trust me" is a terrible way to get them involved in the game. That's what people are trying to tell you. It won't add to their enjoyment despite what you believe, because being good, or "reactive" isn't part of their enjoyment.
---
Maybe it will become part of their enjoyment later. Maybe they will ask you 'hey when I'm questing, sometimes I get surprised by enemy mages and I panic and press wrong keys, what should I do?' and you can talk about that stuff then. When they're attached to the character, the world, and have a reason to get good at the game. When they first start, they have no reason to want to be good, they're just trying to see if it's a fun way to spend their time. "Rebind everything like so, never press backwards, in fact probably unbind S, and also do X Y and Z" is not a good way to introduce them to the game.
---
Debuff limits are not the same question at all. Double CCing had negligible effect on pvp encounters, removing the debuff limits would have a massive effect on PVE and multiple things would need to be changed and balanced to compensate.
---
I'll be playing on an NA server, rolling priest. Leveling shadow, holy at 60
---
Without a doubt why I'm looking forward to Classic over retail. Retail just feels way too similar to Diablo right now. I played BFA for maybe 2 months but all I could ever get myself interested in was arena, because otherwise, loot feels way too replaceable. I enjoyed mythic raiding in Legion, but if you aren't on the cutting edge, the fact that every item you are wearing is probably less than 2 weeks old and probably won't last you another two weeks really bothers me for some reason.

On my server it was Goldshire chat.
---
At launch I did the Northshire Abbey starter quests and moved into Elwynn Forest and hit Goldshire chat.  It was like they gave a bunch of glue-huffing crack monkeys WoW accounts and let them loose on the game.  I deleted my character and rolled Horde.
---
Barrens chat was epic, it make you shake your head, but it also made you laugh.  Goldshire chat was a wretched hive of scum and villainy.
---
&gt; use consumables that are 2-3 times better than all Poisons in raids
---
Can you elaborate? You mean like sharpening stones?
---
Given that thats not what we are talking about, but the best MT is Troll for their berserking. Troll with TF/daggers outperforms an Orc in every stage of the game at TPS. If you are planning on topping the worldwide TPS meters you should go Troll, not tauren and not Orc.
---
&gt; and your "education" of just childishly screaming irrelevant things over and over
---
Yea, I'm sure that's what you heard in your head while you attempted to read what I was saying. Doesn't mean you're correct, it just means you need to come back when sound logic is part of your thought process.
---
Engineering is pretty much the only thing that gives you a non-buyable advantage. Everything else is a matter of taste.
---
This is what we are doing we were alliance all the way from classic to panda when we quit (we were horde for a brief moment in tbc and at the end of panda) but this time around we are going full horde (I always wanted to since I enjoyed the races on horde vs alliance)
---
Victory or death!!
---
All that I was complaining about was the circle jerking of w/m/r on the subreddit - not trying to dissent people for their opinions on the class.  If you dont understand try reading my first comment again :)
---
I got the reference, I was just surprised by the ageism.
---
Oh holy moly... That's just outright awful. I haven't played in quite many years now so I'm not familiar with this, but I really didn't think Blizzard could find more ways to make this game lose more of its integrity - but somehow they managed to do it. 
---
/bonk Blizzard.
---
Or if they were poorly geared or just bad.  I remember killing higher levels on my twinks lol
---
It's honestly better. Once you go so long without sleep you'll start fucking up and making bad decisions. It would actually be better to take time to sleep as it will keep you fresh.
---
Harbringer of Doom and ACLG will be fine for threat and with the proper rest of the gear also fine on Mitigation - so whats your point? We arent arguing about whats fine or viable and whats not, but about whats better. I am sure you can MT with Maces as non human with the right guild in every phase, thus making it "fine" but it isnt better than orc with axes or any race with daggers.
---
Leveling: Best class for solo leveling. Great duo+ leveler
---
PvE: Needed for Tranq, so 1 to 2 slots per raid will be for them. MC they will do decent DPS buy by AQ40 are there for tranq and maybe for wing clip for Nightfall/annihilator.
---
PvP: Pretty much the same as retail hunters pre60 PvP. Lots of HKs, lots of damage, high skill cap.
---
I really liked the way TBC handled that, the last raid which was launched was always pretty difficult, and they would get easier on later patches with nerfs/bug fixes on some bosses (or just because everyone had more gear on following weeks).
---
So I would argue ideal model is: raid pretty fkin hard on the first X weeks, so that only few guild manage to clear it, they can then be nerfed a little after some time so more people can clear (if needed). Also last boss for each raid should be amazingly hard.
---
I couldn’t find it but I was looking for the comment which mentions that a lot of T3 vanilla gear lasted up through Kara in TBC. I’d say they could balance things more like this, for a new expansion. If you obtained the best gear of the previous expansion, it would be a viable option into early ‘new max level’ content.
---
Leveling with OP gear is always a joy, and for those that did the raids and got the gear, they should be able to enjoy it.
---
Probably more money making potential with alch/herb. But skinning as you level, especially on a fresh server is a good source of extra income as well. Not really with lw
---
&gt; Where is mankrik's wife?
---
You spelled mankirk wrong.
---
Your correct spelling of Mankrik's name has no place in Barrens chat.
---
they should still be good w/ 3% less crit, but yeah it will hurt a little
---
It seems like we’ve upset the classic nerds lol
---
I do think everyone should learn as a dps or healer before trying to tank. Its helpful to see what dungeons with a *good* tank will look like. Its not like dps or healer where you can group with good players and see what they do. 
---
MT / OT have different roles in encounters and all. I started raiding as a tank, and ended up finding a few good tanks who taught me, but it took me a lot longer than it should have to become decent. I tanked bc it was easy to get into groups, but ended up having a reputation as a bad tank for a while
---
Fair!
---
If it means anything though, the interpretation shouldn't be that you can't play the game.... it is more like: don't go alone -- especially when your attendance is of utmost importance.
---
Guild B got massacred, but they were still able to limp into the instance.
---
Also, shit goes both ways. Plenty of times Alliance returned the favor in BRM :)
---
Druid here and I'm going to roll druid in classic as well. (Feral DPs)
---
Depending on your spec, there are some professions that are "more optimal" over others.
---
- If you're planning on tanking, you will want "Smoking Heart of the Mountain", which needs you to be an Enchanter. I'll be honest, I'm not sure if you can just drop enchanting afterwards- I never tried.
---
- If you're feral DPs, then tribal leatherworking is nice because several parts of your pre-BiS come from leatherworking (devilsaur, wolfshead helm, etc). To be honest, this applies to tank as well (Warbear Harness, etc)
---
- If you're a moonkin then I'm not sure how the itemization works (I never tried it) but I assume that tailoring would be nice for the set effect on Bloodvine gear. That being said- Bloodvine comes out with ZG, which won't be for a while.
---
Honestly I agree. It's a hard sentiment to express because I really like the aesthetics and color palettes of the modern raids, but they I don't like the "feel" of them. As you say, they don't feel "alive". NH was the last raid I felt super immersed in. Tomb was okay, but there were other problems with it that made me not like it. Antorus  felt super dead to me. It was almost like an extension of Argus that just had WQ bosses that you zoom back and forth to. Enter zone, kill this boss. Cross the bridge, kill the dogs. Portal up here, kill these 2 guys. Jump on the ship, fly over here, kill these 2 guys. Back on the ship over to here, kill these 2 guys. CINEMATIC TIME! Now kill this last guy. I'm a big fan of the non-linear raid layouts like NH, HFC, ICC, etc.
---
For me it would be to integrate the item system from Archeage.  It is essentially RNG, but I believe smarter and works toward adding the hours of countless work to the item you are wielding. 
---
Essentially it worked like this. You get a weapon or piece of armor. You pay in game money to have it upgraded sometimes with additional items. Every rank it had a chance to drop in 'item level' or increase. Each time was a random chance. Based on how you saved your money or had ways of gaining more gave you more chances to increase an already powerful item higher than what it already is. 
---
I know people hate RNG but I believe there is a smart way to implement this and make it not game breaking but gives someone the ability to grind hours and improve their items without just giving them op crap.
---
There are more than a couple comments here regarding "Remove LFR" and that is such a prickly topic that merits discussion and understanding from all of us.
---
You say "LFR reduced the epic scale and sense of accomplishment that comes from earning the right to step into \[Icecrown Citadel and face down Arthas\]" **and you'll get a Texas-sized 10-4 from me, good buddy**.  Not only *entering* the raid but actually *defeating* the big baddie (Kel'thuzad, Illidan, Arthas, etc. - yes I know they were pre-LFR but hold your watermelons) set you far above the chaff and you got to get the ending to the current story.  You. Earned. It. Seems like RPG 101, right?  Back in my day you had to work your way up to even SEE Blackrock Spire and now you complain about being forced to spend an hour clearing the top raid now? **must be fuckin nice**!
---
\~ HOWEVER \~
---
**The decision behind it was that less than 1% of players even saw AQ40.**  That makes it all the more epic but it was a creative/business decision to open up content because all of the assets - **models, animations, textures, sound, programming, lore** \- took so much time without much reward.  This was the official notice from Blizzard (my googling is failing me right now) and their teams didn't feel like it was worth all of the time and energy to create such exclusive content.  I know the RPG lovers here (myself included) passionately feel that this makes it all the more epic and rewarding but the actual members of Team 2 were bummed out and a little discouraged from spending so much on things hardly anyone would see.  The human element we sometimes forget about was very real here.
---
1. LFR caused so many issues with the design of WoW both immediately and slowly (but surely).
---
2. LFR led to Hard Modes so that we could still find a challenge.
---
3. LFR allows everyone to see the content the hard-working teams create.
---
4. **We don't need to worry about LFR in Classic so we can at least** ***look*** **at it objectively and sympathetically here (I hope)**
---
They literally are proving my point and can’t see it.
---
My burnout almost always kicks in around level 34 I've noticed.  If I'm able to push through it and hit 42 (when I can get into Tanaris / ZF) I'm usually good all the way up to 60 from there.  Something about that stretch of levels in the mid 30's - early 40's that I don't enjoy.  Not sure if its the available zones / quests or what... but gets me every single time.
---
I tried it at work with 5 apprentices. First we all took a dump in the toilets and didn’t flush, them we threw/pushed the apprentices in there and locked the door. Some time later we looked through the only (small) window, to our surprise the apprentices were totally unfazed and gazing transfixed on their fucking phones... no change there then.
---
But no body is circle jerking over wmr in WoW since there isn't any?  They ARE discussing dps so that's what I'm talking about instead of an abstract discussion over non-existent wmr.  
---
If you want to be considered viable in the raid then, yes, you need to use MCP on boss fights.
---
Ah gotcha NA is trash =/
---
1) they need to improve on world building. I personally hate that it fees less like a world and more like a matchmaker now.  It’s inconvenient but I liked having to go to town and buy ammo or poison.  Or having to level my pet if I get a new one. Or even having to talk to other players...These things made your character feel embedded in the world.  
---
2) stop homogenizing.  the classes—hell even individual specs— felt so amazingly unique. they each had a role to play in the world.  They’re boring now and don’t have any connection to class lore
---
3) stop pruning. Everything so so streamlined that combat is boring. What was so much fun about older iterations of wow (classic through wotlk) is that each class actually had large toolboxes. From different levels of spells to extremely niche spells to huge talent trees; having a big and varied toolbox was fantastic because you could get better by learning to be flexible with those skills . And those niche almost unnecessary spells were *fun* when you found a situation to bust them out.
---
In response to #1 - I see this a lot, and I only partially agree.
---
I think it's inevitable that new expansions are going to obsolete old content. You can't sell people on something new and have them work through everything that came before it ad infinitum.
---
What DOES need to be removed are all these stupid "catch-up" mechanics that come out every single patch. It basically means even the best players will only ever be a tier ahead. It makes it feel like you never really achieve anything and, ironically, makes demand for Blizzard to push out new content even greater.
---
Lol just wait until the World Dragon Azuregos post.  
---
That one dragon really turned a lot of servers upside down and REALLY showed guild alliances and betrayals.
---
I'm sure a lot of people have similar stories too.
---
Back in 2008 when I had a potatoe PC, I would have to avoid this certain area of Org or I would be in for a slideshow.
---
It's just a joke mate :)
---
This is honestly just useless. I stopped using it after I created a character and couldn't edit or delete anything about it because your buttons don't work properly. 
---
Now I come here and you are saying that nothing is encrypted. How do I delete my account from your database?
---
I hated being forced into Resto in classic not for the raid mechanics, but for everything outside of it. Being a heal spec makes solo content a pain in the ass. You can't grind at all, and while you may be able to drag out a gank attempt for 5 minutes and eventually outlast it, for the most part in random world pvp you just feel like you are stuck in mud.
---
I'd be totally down to roll a shaman again if dual spec was in classic, but it isn't and won't be and shouldn't be, so I'm probably going to play a pure dps class of some sort.
---
That’s insane. I’m not passing on something worth hundreds of gold. It has value to me just as much as them.
---
Honestly I think the more slow, tactical style of combat in classic is a better starting point for new players. Classic is more about thinking about your strategy than in current wow, where everything is a high octane button masher. Nothing wrong with that, but I think for someone knew classic hits the right pace.
---
as to shadow priests and crit. crit for shadow only affects mind blast as mindflay and pain (when your allowed to use it in raids) both canont crit.
---
Not really, what benefit do each of those bring over a core damage class who can do the same but better?
---
WoW 2.0 basically
---
It doesn't have to be I guess. I've never gotten past mid 80's because I didn't like the dumbing-down
---
Why wouldn't the quest for Rune of the Guard Captain be available in Phase 1? Isn't it just a regular quest in Hinterlands?
---
&gt;Also there isn’t much feral Druid loot in classic
---
There's plenty enough for them to tank through the whole game including four horsemen, so I don't see how that's relevant. Not getting steady upgrades only helps out how quickly they get geared.
---
&gt;But that’s situational, and a warrior can do it nearly exactly the same.
---
The entire point is that a warrior *can't*do it exactly the same and your *third fucking tank* can be one that is situationally better for specific bosses while being just as good for trash and adds. Again, *third tank*. Not the main tank, *third tank*.
---
&gt;Also there isn’t much feral Druid loot in classic, the best damage weapon iirc is a blue quality staff.
---
Please google Manual Crowd Pummeler. Even though it's not necessary for off-tanking, it's an easily farmable weapon that by itself 
---
&gt; Druids don’t even get damage bonuses from weapons in feral forms in vanilla lol only stats
---
And yet people use them to great effect and they tank well. You're genuinely just talking out of your ass about things you've heard some random person say about feral tanks. Plenty of competitive pserver guilds use at least one bear tank, and there's been no change from there to classic so far that would change that.
---
Your dps will we be garbage lol.
---
i still have a dream of the priest  bis weapon: ironfoe !
---
If the levels are the same and the guy who shares my faction loses, good. We don't need that weakness in the Horde.
---
Zuk zuk.
---
You wanna meet up on dorthnale and 1v1?
---
Holy Paladin ~
---
Are you implying that all the people who wanted classic are elitist? I wanted classic. I played on private servers. I want people to play the way they want to. Lets be honest you don't know who is actually telling people they should just enjoy the game. But you chalk that particular opinion you don't like to a group of people you feel have less of a right to classic then you do. That doesn't make you a classic elitist it just makes you an asshole.
---
Yeah, first time i went into storm wind, I jumped into the water and got shit on by the croc. I was always wearing of SW canals after that lol
---
If I roll priest, I’ll be going fishing/cooking, that’s just straight gold income and incredibly useful for leveling/endgame consumes. As well as herb/alchemy for main professions. It’ll be easy to find groups to make flasks as a priest, and I’ll easily be able to farm materials at 60 since killing things won’t be required. So just all around just easy to make gold and easy to raid/5mans.
---
faerie fire on all the rogues :)
---
No.
---
Simply put, that's a ninja for me.  
---
You  wanna equip it? Go for it and slap it on, I won't stand in your way.  
---
You are simply being greedy for it? Hit that greed button hard.  
---
How can it get simpler than that? You can't even make an argument against that or you'd have to start rolling every green that drops simply because the gold gain from selling it benefits you.
---

---
If you were resto or elemental spec, I wouldn't have an issue with it. However, it seems like a very poor choice for enhance, especially if there are other casters in the group that would benefit more from it. 
---
I still wouldn't say you ninja'd it but I wouldn't want to party with you after that. Items like that with crit chance and spellpower are better for builds that can best utilize them, it feels like a waste when someone needs the item who can utilize it's max potential. 
---
As for the it's an upgrade part, that has little affect on me when you can still have a terrible lvl 40 green equipped because you just hit max level. So with that comparison in mind, every weapon is an upgrade so where do you draw the line for what's right for your build vs someone else's.
---
I farmed BT back then and thus did it quite many times. It was a decent instance in my opinion - nothing special. There were a few really cool fights such as Reliquary of Souls and Illidan, but besides that the other bosses were just... present. 
---
The design of the instance was also a bit... Meh.. I mean, it was okay, but nothing exciting like Karazhan, Naxxramas or Sunwell Plateau was. The feeling I had once BT was cleared for the week was more like "phew glad we got that done" rather than "wow, what a cool instance this was". 
---
Karazhan was awesome both in terms of boss fights and visuals/design. It's really one of the most (if now THE most) visually appealing instance I've personally tried. The theme was just spot on, and most of the bosses fit in so well. 
---
However, I still hold my ground that the best instance ever created (both when it comes to dungeons and raids) is Magister's Terrace in TBC. It was a visually stunning instance, every single boss encounter was unique and not even close to anything else in the game (at least that's what I felt at the time), and it had a very fitting difficulty. If you didn't have someone in your dungeon group with some sort of CC then you would have a hard time, and if you actually managed to pull 2 trash groups you would almost certainly wipe. Just spot on!
---
But who? That's the problem. Most guilds will struggle to find enough decent healers, and many of the healers they do have would prefer to have the dps spot. So inviting a hybrid dps is often a slap in the face to the healers. And without healers, you have no raid.
---
True legends play wow at work.
---
Level 30-45 was my burnout range.
---
better than wowhead? I need to decide which of them to use.
---
i agree, wow is worse then drugs!
---
Really excited to tank vanilla again but wooooo boy there’s gonna be an adjustment period for people who never played vanilla or at least TBC when it comes to waiting for tank to get aggro.
---
Thats exactly what i mean. As soon as a new patch comes out you can skip all previous raids from the same expansion.
---
Whoah mate, don't just name drop FD as being fucked and then in the next sentence say current leeway is acceptable. Being a hunter I find this all kinds of unacceptable seeing as its literallyy most clutch move in pvp.
---
sl with current melee leeway can hunters even kite Drakk in ubrs?
---
Okay, so you've got a clip. What was the rogue's latency, and what was the druid's latency? If they're both sub 30ms then ya the clip shows what you want. I bet if we had the same video from the druid's perspective we'd see a rogue far behind them running after them and able to hit them from what seems like pretty far away. Even today if I see myself riding right next to my friend while mounted usually he sees himself 5-15 yds ahead of me depending on the exact conditions.
---
None of your video 'evidence' proves anything.
---
Your guild should not have allowed you to roll on an item for your offspec against someone that needed it for their raid spec.
---
There’s no difference between a green boe and a purple boe other than value. Everyone needs instead of greeding just to ensure one guy doesn’t try and snag a guaranteed win.
---
If you can’t see the difference between a 1g vendor and a 500g AH item, you’re delusional.
---
Does the shadow oil mess with windfury? First time I’ve honestly heard about this
---
I remember a few burnout points on my first char and eventually rerolling, looking up quest hubs and leveling guides to try to reduce that as much as possible. I should have known it was coming because I'd heard my brother talking about how grindy the game got while he was leveling through what I think was EPL grinding grubs before I got into the game.
---
This time around I'll probably just use something like vanilla guide to keep it as efficient as I can. I don't need to level fast, I just want to make sure I'm getting all the efficient quest hubs and XP mobs along the way.
---
Why would it be? They aren't mana batteries and their only damage spell that doesn't take up a valuable debuff slot has a cooldown. You're unironically better off taking a moonkin since they at least give their group a buff.
---
Yes. If you're a Horde rogue in a group with a shaman, you don't put any temporary enchant on your main hand weapon.
---
&gt; Smoking Heart of the Mountain
---
you only need to be enchanting to make it not use it and if you needed enchanting to be able to use it, then it would show “Enchanting (##)” on the gear piece. you can drop enchanting after if you wanted.
---
I honestly believe almost all guilds will have a feral as a off tank. This will mostly be decided in advance also the player of the druid.
---
except troll animations are ugly af
---
It's not really a thing. You can buy a boost to 110 for $60.
---
Not that leveling is hard to behind with. You can hit max level in a few days.
---
I will eventually play mostly the warrior, get him to 60 and only dabble on the alts. But I can’t wait to play them all right now, and I like to make my own stuff like armor and bags and potions. So starting out I’ll probably play a bit of each, keeping them roughly the same level and sending crafted items between them. Mage will go first so she can make bags, priest for pots, etc. it isn’t efficient, but I’ll enjoy the hell out of it.
---
My brother finally hit 20 and got cat form earlier this week and he was absolutely stoked. It's pretty bare bones when you first get it, but it was just fun to hear him get excited about it. Watching his character icon go from cat to a ghost over and over last night was funny though - he trekked up from Booty Bay to Westfall for the aquatic form quest and must've died 10 times on the way. He died again right after he finally got the quest objective completed out in the ocean too. Good times.
---
Remove flying.
---
Remove arenas and all competitive elements from the game, that shit destroys class balance and you end up with what we have now. (no identity and everyone being able to everything)
---
No more dailies or world quests
---
You just autolearn new abilities/ranks as you go. Pretty lame. Very "convenient".
---
If you're guild has enough healers but can't find enough dps, which is an absurdly rare situation, of course. One shadow priests does a great job buffing warlock dps.
---
shadow priests don't need bloodvine.  you can use talent points to get spell hit.
---
skinning is good for making money on a fresh server when you are leveling.  at level 60 you are better off getting herbalism for making money.  Engineering is the best profession in the game so herb/engineering would be good for you :)
---
Undead warrior is nice horde side.  WotF allows you to make one stance dancing mistake while tanking or in PvP.
---
*nightelf scum*
---
Pressing "Q" instead of "9" isn't a skill.  It isn't preparing them for Naxx, it isn't suggesting they become hardcore, nor that PvP should be their main goal.  It is, quite simply, changing the controls to one which allows an easier navigation of the world.  
---
Again, you people hear the word "wife" and think she needs to be coddled.  If he said "my brother in law", no one would have any issue with suggesting they not click and to set his buddy up for success.  If constantly suggesting to an adult that they should play Classic is going to scare them away, informing them about control setting sure as fuck won't.  In a functional relationship you don't wait for an individual to approach you before offering advice.  It's only being suggested here because people are assuming that a basic explanation would daunt his wife.  If she wants to click she can say so, or do so, but to tell him to leave the room and wait for her to come to him about questions is a more fantastical world than Azeroth, to how girlfriends learning WoW actually function.  
---
He should remove himself so that her excitement is legitimate and not proxy to his own.  He should not treat her like a fabled creature, an easily frightened doe, ready to dart off from the computer as soon as she is discovered.  But he also shouldn't hover and play for her.  
---
Giving your wife the same advice that you'd give a guy friend isn't going to overwhelm her.  Giving tips and tricks to anyone isn't going to force her off of the game.  Looming and orating a complete walkthrough of first twenty levels without allowing the individual to experience the world through discovery, however, will.
---
Everyone is trying to equate controller advice with overbearing actions, and they, and you, are wrong.
---
I'm planning to play a druid and level with a friend as much as possible. I want to try and embody the hybrid nature of the class as much as possible while leveling and wanted to know what druid players though of this build for 1-60 and getting raid ready.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxGMoZVvcoxo
---
I would grab the feral talents first then the balance ones and then resto. I figure by the time I start going into healing talents it will be really helpful to heal dungeons.
---
Right, sorry I didn’t word the second part of my question at all hah. What I meant was if you put shadow oil on just the OH plus the flask does it still out dps max rank instant poison by a fair margin?
---
I'll group with you!
---
Professions suitable for a low level alt (basically just crafting) require level 35 to max out. Unless you're farming low level mats, gathering professions really aren't suitable for low level alts in my opinion.
---
The quest to obtain it wasn't added until patch 1.5, which means it might not be available until Phase 3.
---
Hi, 
---
so first, This is a sandbox server: if you don't want to touch it, just don't. i rather have less people registered, makes testing a little bit easier.
---
I have a ton of experience, it's just that I don't have time to encrypt data that is wiped almost everyday because i'm constantly adding stuff. If you don't trust me no problem lol but this ain't a final product where security will of course be accounted for.
---
Paladins don’t have a taunt in classic.
---
Yup this ^^
---
Couldn't agree more with you. Back in the day, I was an Enhancement Nightfall bot. My guild was able to clear up to the four horsemen before TBC came out. There is plenty of room for Hybrid builds, but you may need to go above standard DPS classes when it comes to consumables and the biggest thing I can tell anybody is you need to be on and ready to raid. I can't tell you enough that 90% of raid leaders will absolutely be willing to take you along if you show the effort.
---
No problem kid.
---
Hi sorry forgot to mention but thought it was obvious fron my above mentioned builds, that I will be playing hybrid healing specs at endgame.
---
Not gonna lie. First read that as alcoholism. Was gonna advise you that Classic may be serious business, but it's not THAT serious.
---
Not sure about the set bonus, but you will need 300 tailoring to get it if it does apply to spriests. 
---
If you don't plan on having tailoring late-game and switching to engineering, you could maybe have an argument for mining.  Still, I think skinning is the best prof for tailoring if you're putting enchanting on an alt.  Super easy to level, lots of gold potential even if you're just vendoring it, little to no competition, farming it rewards other gold/loot, tons of great farming spots that will be uncontested...
---
Mine from the wotlk era broke down a while back, I might be forced to buy a new one when classic comes
---
Ah yes, you got scammed before and try to justify it like that. I understand that and I catch myself waiting for everyone rolling on the item before I put my greed in the hat aswell, gotta admit it. But the difference between us would be, if I was in a group of 5 and one bastard decides to be an a\*\*hole, I would try to snatch the goods from him to reroll it again between the remaining 4 guys.  
---
I'd much rather maintain a healthy reputation than being the guy unable to make money outside of scamming everyone of his chance.
---
 Negligible  becasue given lag, the event that bot the rogue and the mage would get their CC of in the same batch was rare - now it will be much more common and actually have a less than a negligable effect on PVP, so by asking for no changes, we've actually changed how the game will play and feel.
---
The bot corpses spelling out gold selling websites is juuuust to the right
---
You can drop enchanting once you get the trinket.
---
So basically you're saying you're as uptight a buzzkill now as back then. 
---
It's 2019 the internet is basically 50% memes. I don't find this, or 99% of these memes funny. I simply shrug my shoulders and mover on. 
---
You're in charge of what you consume. Don't like it? Just move on to the next.
---
nelf priest is for solo shadowmeld pvp games, and that's about it 
---
star shards is functionally useless at 60, and you will probably take it off your bar since there is no situation where casting star shards is worth the gcd + channeling time 
---
its a fun idea but wand spec is the same kill speed/uptime and you won't gimp yourself out of shadow spec power
---
Classic+ is going to be WoW 2 precursor.
---
I am still amazed that people don't see the inevitability of Classic+ and WoW 2 afterwards.
---
40-50 is the hardest part for me, theres a lack of quests to cleanly advance you so you have to spend a lot of time farming. at this point you have a mount so often you just cruise away when you probably should be farming on your way elsewhere.  
---
imo, 50-60 is simple, fast, and fun compared to 40-50
---
Yes, if your Warlocks are specced for Improved Shadow Bolt (and all of them should be) and they're using Curse of Shadow (also very likely), then Shadow Oil combined with the flask on your off-hand is almost twice the damage as level 60 Instant Poison on your off-hand.
---
Daggers do less DPS than swords and have faster attack speed therefore benefitting less from Sinister Strike instant attacks. Swords also get the 5% chance for double attack, which as I understand is strictly superior to +5% crit daggers get.
---
Or just read more here: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-talents-builds-classic-wow#pve-builds it seems like a decent enough guide.
---
IDK, I said the word neckbeard and people became triggered.  Then they associated raiding for a few hours as the same type of no life intensity.  Seems to me pitiful insult was unraveled, and you want to skip on up for another rather ridiculous one.
---
Its tough for hunters to find good looking end game gear. Black Dragon Mail is one of the coolest options, though. Ill probably end up sticking with it until the end just for those cosmetic reasons. 
---
If I can pick lower level gear Id have to say Ornate Mail with Blue Dragon shoulders looks fantastic.
---
Again, you're wrong. There's no benefit to a better control scheme for a budding player. You see a benefit because you want to play better. Not everyone does. I wouldn't give this advice to my guy friends starting a game either. It's simply not relevant and has them worry about playing 'wrong' before they have a chance to play at all.
---
Hi,
---
Thanks for you response, first let me say that you can inbox me your account name if you really want it deleted i'll make sure it is indeed deleted.
---
Then, as stated in my post (which you obviously didn't read), this is a WIP, the project is not meant to be used in production right now... you don't have to be that negative my dude ;(
---
You can't edit your characters because right now its not what i'm focusing since we should be able to import characters once i know how Blizzard will handle their Classic API.
---
Thanks anyways for the feedback
---
&gt; I'd love go track my progress in game.
---
Nothing is stopping you from journaling about wow.
---
Obviously it is too far gone. Beyond salvation.
---
It won't die...just moved to mobile in 10.0.
---
It is crystal clear that Retail WoW is going to be on mobile in less than 5 years (if that).
---
I agree. Sadly what I said still applies. 
---
I used to co-run a raiding guild in WOTLK and tanked off-nights on my Paladin in Ulduar. Didn't stop randoms and pugs not in my guild from being assholes.
---
Everyone does get a chance, you all need. 
---
We both know 100% there will be people who will try and steal if it everyone hit greed. Even if you wait, if it’s just the two of you the chance of them winning skyrockets. If they win, 3 other people never even had a chance.
---
My system gives everyone an equal shot. That’s the only difference between the two of us. Don’t try and act like you have some moral high ground here.
---
My autocorrect read it the same way as you, I had to recorrect it.
---
Battleshout actually out agroes demo
---
Thanks for the pro tip!
---
Same issue as with hi-detail armour. Looks great, for like 5 minutes. Then it becomes boring. Back in the day we had to use our imagination to really picture our characters &amp; the world. That goretusk board in Redridge was the scariest fricking thing imaginable. Not a low-poly mob. Perception is important for immersion. The more detailed the game world &amp; gear becomes, the less ownership we take of it.
---
Pretty much exactly what I did when the redskull autoban update went live
---
WoW rebuilt on the Overwatch engine would be great, but it absolutely needs to keep its cartoony feel.
---
every class in the game can get fishing/cooking/first aid.  they are secondary professions.
---
you still get the two primary professions
---
Its proveable but no one bothers to go through the trouble because why would you? Anyone age 30 and above knows how internet speeds have changed. When I was a kid 5.6k was the hottest thing and the fastest connection was T1 which is something like 3mb down and only businesses had the kind of money for that.
---
Nowadays? Dude I can get 50 down in the middle of nowhere half an hour away from civilization for like 80$. Internet and latencey has gotten better and it goes without saying or needing to provide any proof. Youtube and Netflix wouldn't exist if the majority of the world was still on dialup.

An Spriest with engineering is absolutely deadly. I think you should level as herbalism and skinning and then trade skinning for engineering at 60. Forget about tailoring. It doesn’t give you anything you can’t get from a tailoring friend and you can’t make much gold with it.

drums in the deep
---
I love mage tier 2/3
---
Either feels lore friendly to me. I really like leveling with alch especially as a shaman. The potions pay off way more than lw gear while you level.
---
Hunters are pretty buggy so far in the beta. I mained a hunter for years but am holding off to see what Blizz does with the class .
---
Hunter has a high skill cap. You don't really learn how to be a good hunter through the leveling process. Most people just act as a DPS turret behind a pet tank. As a PVE hunter you'll be expected to trap, kite, tranq and use all your tools.
---
Pretty sure most people started classic with no mmo experience at one point in their lives
---
I really enjoyed reading this i can tell you put alot of time and effort into it.  I started my raiding career on a pve server in TBC. this is a good picture of what im in for going alliance on pvp server this time
---
The thing that killed modern WoW for me was the introduction of the "eternal grind" or "never-ending skinnerbox" model in Legion. I used to like playing hardcore at the start of a new expansion until I had established my character and then play maintenance mode for the rest of the expansion, doing minor things each day and spending most of my time doing raids, the activity I enjoyed in the game.
---
Don't get me wrong I liked Legion initially, but I could tell from the start it was never going to work for me long term, staying on top of things in Legion was a full time job and the constant RNG lottery nature of the game was super frustrating, and BFA is just a worse version of Legion, especially on the gameplay front.
---
I actually feel that retail is way too far gone, it cannot be saved while investors are looking at graphs with a short-sighted view to influence gameplay design in their favour.
---
&gt; The problem is for the population between those 2 group. Not enough hardcore to enjoy MM raiding requierement in farming and consomable, nor MM+, but not casual enought to want to be given free loot and free raid tier. 
---
MAIN REASON why Retail will see about 40-50% of their player base moving to Classic, for good.
---
People still don't see it, but Retail, by the end of this year (so, like 4 months into Classic) is going to be a ghost town.
---
Okay, but regardless he's far from being a baby boomer. The definition of a Gen Xer is, what, like Kurt Cobain I guess? He would be 52 or 53.
---
I've had 'Mark Skull' bound to middle click since wrath.  You just mark skull and run in.  Then, when the mob is like 5%-10% hp you change targets and press middle click to mark skull and keep tanking.
---
As any sort of hybrid playstyle your +healing will be very limited, so your ability to downrank healing touch will be highly limited.  Also +healing is just hard to find early in general.  Meaning you will rely more on regrowth and rejuv.  I would move points out of tranquil spirit and natures focus into imp rejuv and gift of nature.
---
It really wasn't until cryptstalkers that they got a actually cool set imo
---
4 hunters + one healer can be fun   
---
If a pull is only 4 mobs, that's one pet pet mob. Multishot away, the pets have aggro.  
---
Hunters can rez pets constantly in combat if needed, and can heal their own pets. Healer is there in case a hunter dies and needs to be rezzed, and to heal the pet tanking boss, which will be a turtle
---
Most of those assets look like garbage, especially all the human buildings look like straight off some asset store. There's also no reason to make this kind of static scenes in UE4 when a plain old 3D modelling software would get you better quality.
---
I'm going to camp greys for hours, and you aren't going to stop me.
---
1 2 3 4 5 E Q R F M4 M5 M3
---
Stuff like C is reserved for Resurrection or the likes as I don't have hyper flexible fingers to use the bottom row.
---
Frostbite unfortunately is one of the worst pve talents in the game. A freeze on a trash mob or whatever will get people killed, so it's a non starter for raiding so that's good. God tier for pvp though.
---
Assuming threat and mana isn't a problem it depends what you are farming. Dm lasher farm once you get prebis or better you dont need imp blizzard. However if you want to farm dm n then imp blizz is huge. Due to spell batching it looks like it may be terrible in pvp as well. I'd consider putting the imp blizz point into the longer slow, but your spec is great.
---
if you are not human and alliance your rogue will be daggers.
---
if you want swords than roll human
---
Pre-Cata Wailing Caverns.
---
I have a serious love-hate relationship with that dungeon. Many fond memories of running it with the small group/clique in my guild that I didn't just if my leveling the with back in Vanilla and BC, but also meant horrific memories of getting lost in there constantly. I could never ever navigate that place on my own. It was so bad that I went back at level 80 to get the achievement on my Death Knight in WotLK thinking it'd be a cake walk and spent almost three hours in there because I kept getting turned around.
---
Butt the new, autopilot, straight line, no gap to jump over Wailing Caverns? It's just so boring.
---
Just found this today from your WPvP post.  Absolutely fantastic read!
---
There's certainly no consequence to broaching the subject either.  Which is what the argument against such advise has thus been predicated upon.
---
Don't tell me how to enjoy classic. I've been there, I've leveled through it. I hated every moment outside of Elwyn Forest. I enjoy the endgame with my guild an my friends, not replaying the same zones I've leveled countless times. If I want to take the most efficient way to get the the part of the game I personally enjoy, I will.
---
The BRE debuff will only apply to the warrior wielding it and not the entire raid in classic. So just having a BRE might not guarantee you a raid slot if you don't know how to use it.
---
Yes, and they already use melee weapons. Making it melee only is the dumb part.
---
Humor? More like fucking wholesome. Reflair with Nostalgia and feels.
---
*goes back to rebeat WC3*
---
Working hard to get that blue or epic bis and be recognized or see someone with a legendary and feel like that people earn it. Im tired of retail instant gratification everyone wins mentallity with free loot piñatas
---
&gt;! TIL !&lt;
---
&gt; The question "Can druids tank?" results in numerous responses telling you why warriors are the best tanks often without any reference to the question you asked
---
How is that off-topic? The response is usually "yes but warriors are better".
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
They will grow on you. You will be using bows for a large amount of time and rok'delar will last you many months of raid content as well.
---
Thx for the reply.
---
Will definitely try your guide, as it seems more "easy/straightforward" guide than Joana's.
---
No it won’t xd if theres any room for an enh its in a hard casual guild, enh has nothing to do with serious guilds
---
Shadow Priests can only get +10% hit from talents, they need to find another 6% in their gear.
---
Search the item on Wowhead. The item ID is in the url.
---
What are you doing to pool 25 rage before a pull?  Just chain pulling?
---
It is definitely an adjustment, but a rewarding one. Any thing you can master will set you apart that much more from the riprap
---
Hell, having a decent buzz going was the only way I could stand to raid back in the day.
---
1 shadow priest is absolutely desirable in a 16 debuff slot raid. Giving all your warlocks a 15% damage buff is nothing to sniff at.
---
Essentially, the "Shadow" priest is just a healer that also keeps a debuff up.
---
I have yet to see real proof that leeway is broken. All I've seen is a bunch of videos from Vanilla where it looks like it works differently but we don't see the user's ping on the screen (because why would it be) so you can't really know. And all pvp videos from vanilla are also one sided (again, it's not like I expect both sides to exist). In those there are two people with two different latencies and we really have no way of knowing.
---
I'm actually in favor of them fixing this stuff, I'm in favor of anything that makes the game play better while not compromising the core design philosophies of Vanilla, like not all DPS needing to be equal.
---
Pvp ranks which I missed since I joined in tbc and the leveling experience. I love spending months leveling.
---
Being mad won’t remove layering, sorry to say.
---
Goldshire Inn. That place can be a cesspool.
---
&gt;thinking playing a hybrid build at 60 lvl. Thinking of 19/11/21
---
Except you left out the keyword "healing" in your original post, so it wasn't obvious.
---
But okay, no problem.
---
Dropped into Azeroth, that shit looking so expansive
---
Who'd have thought we'd get our second chances?
---
I was under the impression that this was never done because of various reasons. Lore being one. You can’t be role playing as that one band of adventurers who defeated Nefarion surely? 
---
I mean I guess you could, you’d just cut yourselves off of any server wide RP and you’d only interact with your own guild.
---
Yes, shadow weaving is a viable spec... not really the same thing as a "shadow priest."
---
Teldrassil has lower pop but also has a lot of drop quests(that you cannot share), Blackmoss, and that fucking Relics of Wakening.
---
I think overall best questing area is Dun Morogh. Since most Dwarves/Gnomes will go to Elwynn instead.
---
I'm excited to fail.
---
I'm excited to build all the wrong talent points and end up with a gimped build that I need to correct. I'm excited to go into a dungeon, accidentally double pull, and end up at the graveyard. I'm excited to get completely lost while questing. I'm excited to not have enough silver to purchase my next spell rank.
---
I'm tired of the game holding my hand. At this point wow almost plays itself.
---
I'm excited to fail, because victory tastes sweetest after defeat.
---
Getting excited over every cloth drop
---
And when they came from nightfall procs... mmmmmm insta dead
---
It's too far gone. In order to make retail appeal to vanilla players you would need to change it so heavily that it would be an entirely different game....AKA Classic.
---
People can give gold to whoever they wish
---
Really enjoyed the hunter segment with Zeroed. There are some questions in the air about hunter performance come release.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
I think a lot of it is you dont have a mount yet but you have enough XP that you gotta travel a lot
---
That's kind of beside the point I was making.  But in reality, no, the lag wouldn't affect the window, the connection quality was just the reason for the window in the first place.  It simplified how much data was being sent.
---
You’re just being toxic bro and I’m not sure why I guess. It usually comes from a bad place but I’m just not sure if people realize they’re doing it or if it’s just like natural
---
You have no clue about how politics work, do you?
---
So true !
---
I was rushing to XR as a lvl 43, charging into the Alliance scum, just to be killed in 3 seconds...AFTER popping a Fear.
---
But those 3 seconds were wasted on a lvl 43 Warrior, instead a lvl 60 Horde brother.
---
And I feared them so...I did my part:D
---
HoTW druid is good. You just swap gear and either tank, heal or dispel. No need to limit everyone to one role only just because you never saw that happening in your guild back in your days. The most important thing is that everyone give enough for the raids success while the necessary effort may vary greatly between classes (more so with specs) 
---
Even balance druid is fine if one brings other gear as well and is okay with the fact that they need to do other roles at some fights. It's also important to brings those extra consumables so they won't be nearly as much dead weight as they would be while oom. And who cares if they would have done better with mage with same effort? My guess is that he/she wouldn't actually have done any better at all and would have quit instead.
---
Capable people are always welcome unless all you really focus on is speed clearing raids for fun while disenchanting and vendoring all drops.
---
Making gold.
---
Safe space eh?  Definitive proof that people complaining are 4chan edgelords.
---
If this is what you think, then you obviously has not played as a ne.
---
Consider what you want to do beyond all else, then make concessions from there.
---
For me, I decided I wanted to roll Alliance on a PvP realm so I could kill try hards that want that racial edge as Horde. It sounded like a fun challenge.
---
That had me deciding between Warlock, Paladin, and Rogue. After a lot of questions to people I settled on Paladin, as cleansing fears for allies and being a HoJ / healbot sounded fairly annoying for my enemies. Downranked conscencration for fishing rogues stealth. Blessing of Protection for my warlocks. The list of reasons goes on.
---
Sprinkle in raiding and time to beat off while leveling and I found my decision.
---
You know I didn't want to be that hard on you. I thought you were just enthusiastic, but inexperienced?
---
Your response shows a total lack of respect for people's privacy and I wouldn't be surprised if you were snooping through the data just for fun. It also highlights once again how clueless you are. You are saying you are just storing username and passwords, but then how are you storing all the guild info? The forums? Chat? Lists?
---
I will actively encourage everyone to never use your service since you are apparently totally unconcerned with the huge privacy concerns that your product has.
---
cringe
---
Retail raids are harder due to mechanics, Classic raids like AQ40/Naxx were harder due to itemization breakpoints. These it's much easier to get everyone geared to the same level so that the entire raid could pull the numbers required for an encounter, then the difficulty is getting everyone on the same page learning the dance.
---
Back in the day, progression in AQ40 required a significant portion people be geared with BWL or AQ20/ZG gear in order to pull off the numbers needed for bosses. Naxx required at least most of the dps to be kitted with AQ gear in order to pull the dps numbers to down a lot of the bosses. Given the fact that it could take months to complete your tier sets since you had to split 5 drops/boss in a 40 person raid, clearing endgame classic raids will take hundreds of hours literally due to the fact the gearing a full 40 man raid up to be able to take on the content will be massively timegated.
---
My whole life as a resto druid in raid was ducking Healing Touch casts.
---
Yeah you just raid OOC. 
---
Generally you have your own guild storylines progressing apart from the game storylines. Raiding and dungeons are kept separate in most cases.
---
I mean I played the game back in the day and I had a year /played before TBC came out. I raided in a very competitive guild. 
---
It’s just not common. It’s not impossible like I said in the top level post, but realistically a feral Druid MAYBE gets 1/40 raid slots if the guild is using one. That’s how many slots exist for that play style. Then you have to put together all the alternative loot because none of your class sets are useful for feral. It’s just not a fun time for the average new player.
---
Also MCP has a 1 hour cooldown. That’s so inconvenient and unreliable.
---
I partially remember (it’s been over 10 years) having a feral Druid for situations like the vael fight where our resto Druid would teleport to town, respec to feral and use the elemental tanking loot, summon him back, then after the fight have him go back to town and switch back to resto and summon him back to the raid and finish as resto.
---
I get it, there are situations where it’s good, but for the majority of the time it is not the best. And if you are playing in a guild trying to win, you want the best.
---
ah so majority of the items from tailoring are BoP? sorry i'm actually a really new player, spent 2 days watching videos to try and figure stuff out :P
---
How hard the game was. The sense of community. 
---
And the best reason.... a fresh start for all.
---
The meme is bad and doesn’t even reflect layering in any tangible connection to reality.
---
It is being upvoted by perma-adolescent edgelords.
---
Yeah that's a better one!
---
The pre Naxx tank clownsuit yuk. Not looking forward to that
---
A widely held opinion.
---
You must have had a poor vanilla experience back in the day if that was common practice.  
---
Do what you think works best for you, just don't expect everyone to like it.
---
We got classic - pretty empowering..
---
Why not demand what is right?
---
OP did a fantastic job
---
I think you mean caporeia. A different Brazilian martial art.
---
I would not be this certain, it's important to not underestimate the % of ultra casual in the game right now. 
---
Less populated, sure thing, but ghost town? I don't think so. The future will tell us.
---
is this supposed to contradict my post about shadow priests not needing to use bloodvine? it doesn't.
---
you do know there are other items with hit on it?
---
It's funny because it's got OOM right in the name
---
I dont like the big fights as much even tho a BG comeback feels awesome. Arena is on a smaller scale where
---
What the guy said is only partially true. It's the difference between revenue and profit. There is no way that WoW makes more revenue now than it did during Wrath. Assuming BfA still has 2 million players (a generous estimate imo), that's a 10 million sub loss from the peak in Wrath. That's annual revenue of $1.8 billion dollars lost in subs. I highly doubt Blizzard's cash shop is pulling in that much annual revenue. Some more back of the envelope math: assuming 2 million active subs and average price of $30 for a cash shop item, each player would have to buy 30 items per year to cover that shortfall. I highly doubt thats taking place, I've never purchased a single thing (transfer, race change, mount, pet, etc) from the store and I'm sure I'm not alone.
---
The key difference is the margins. There is essentially no cost to things like transfers and race changes. Mounts and pets do have a cost given that they are usually brand new models and designs, but the margins are still way way way higher than a monthly sub (expansion or patch development costs). While the raw dollar amounts that Blizzard is pulling in from WoW is undoutedly lower, the game's profitability has definitely gone up since the Wrath days. 
---
What's interesting to me to think about is: can Blizzard change their design/development philisophies/tactics in a way that makes standard game development more profitable? I think the answer to that is yes. While I understand that things are more challenging now and players expect more, but MC was built in a week by 1 guy. Lets say he worked over time - 100 man-hours went into developing MC and it provided months and months of content. Now, we get 2 new zones, a new dungeon, and a new raid, and within a month people will be burnt out. This is a simplification, obviously, but I think there's room for positive change in this area.
---
Same, I felt like I never completed a part of my childhood. Its good to be back!
---
Anonymity builds spite. If you are in a  community where your name (irl or in game) matters. People will be nicer. Guilds that have shitty people in them will develop a shit reputation and it will hurt them. People that are constantly toxic will eventually be outcastes. Not being able to change servers is a huge blessing for this reason.
---
&gt; Seriously. Imagine yourself playing with some mouth breather over your shoulder telling you what to do every 15 seconds
---
You've just described every minute of married life.
---
Actually I should have mentioned that I'm running a guild that me and my IRL friends are gonna be in and if Sulfuras drops the squad said it's mine.
---
I don't think it's all that bad for enhancement.  It has more dps than arcanite reaper, and a lot of your damage comes from your spells.  You use a ton of mana casting these inefficient spells too. 
---
Atk speed doesn't matter when you are using WF.
---
The OP was concerned about not being able to raid because they read some posts about how hardcore other people are going.  I said there would be PUGs, and that PUGs are usually more fun without the no life neckbeard mentality of min maxing.  That they would have plenty of opportunity to raid in Classic despite the min maxing mentality.  People then got salty as fuck because of a nerd word, I stood my ground.  Apparently not cowering to downvotes is how an individual becomes insecure, or wait toxic, or no whatever is next in your laundry list of taglines, and on and on.
---
10/10
---
Inb4 top of the sub.
---
Nope, no negative experiences whatsoever with this system. It’s fair for everyone, not just best for me.
---
Then we agree to disagree.
---
I get that you didn't think it was important enough to highlight, but you can't expect everyone to read every word. You made a website and wanted people to try it out.
---
I wanted to expirience the website as sombody who had no expectations going into it at all, so yea I didn't read it. I'm slightly frustrated at the lack of responsibility for peoples personal information.
---
You really should not keep a database with peoples passwords unless you are ready to encrypt it. You also listed it like halfway down your post. This needs to be in bold at the top or in the title ideally. 
---
My bad for assuming that it was standard practice to encrypt peoples data, I'll make sure to doublecheck in the future. PMing you my account now.
---
Don't do anything let WoW do what it does best and enchant players with its world.
---
I got my now wife to play on a private server with my brother an I a while back and we soured her experience of WoW. Not only was it the first major wasd game she'd experienced it didn't help that my brother and I would basically clear everything and be moving on the the next thing when she was still figuring out the basics. 
---
My plan for getting my wife interested in Classic will be having a character just to play with her that takes on the excited yet passive tour guide persona. Taking in the sights, reading the quests, exploring all the things, but allowing her to do it at her own pace.
---
Clearly this video was not designed for horde players..
---
Those are fantastic things that persist in any role-playing game. If you think WoW could exist without gear or levels persisting, I don't see how progression would ever work. You'd be basically playing Second Life.
---
And you know what? You likely WILL see that warrior who helped you kill Hogger three months ago, because Layering WILL end. 
---
Also, you're contradicting yourself within your own argument, here. You're saying layering will lead to just playing in empty shards. Yet you'll be ganked by enemy factions, so will it be empty? Or will there be other players?
---
And yes, there is such a thing as too many players. Private servers have a fraction of the audience of WoW, they have problem on Fresh launches. Just look at the stress test of servers. There are too many players right out of the gate.
---
Y'know what, actually, go play Second Life if ALL you care about is community. There's more to WoW than that, and if gameplay is to be preserved at all, then there needs to be accounting for simply too many people.
---
You're being hyperbolic and dramatic with rather little to back up any of your claims.
---
Welcome to the classic wow community lol
---
Everyone was poor as fuck when the best goldfarming options were unknown and everyone would just go Tyr's. So yea potting was considered cheating since they couldn't afford it themselves lol.
---
Depends on the player - I prefer to heal or tank but healing is my favorite role.  I always play a healer first in an RPG.  Then I'll check out the tanks.  I feel that tanks do play a support role for the entire group, just like the healer.
---
Pics of the tankard?
---
*reads thread title, eyes glaze over until reaching the bottom and noticing  and your edit*
---
Oh hell no, time to piss in this mans cherios! I'll welcome all new players but the second I see an Alliance flair the dickery, assholdry and douchebaggery comes out in full force! TAZ DINGO MON!
---
No crz/sharding
---
No flying
---
No LFR
---
Drake is trash, dont taint wow with his lameness.
---
Warlock: shadowform from priests
---
Yep
---
No, it's the opposite. A majority of the items from Tailoring are bind-on-equip, which means anyone can use them, not just Tailors.
---
The exceptions to this are:
---
* [Robe of the Archmage](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14152/robe-of-the-archmage) (Mage only)
---
* [Robe of the Void](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14153/robe-of-the-void) (Warlock only)
---
* [Truefaith Vestments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14154/truefaith-vestments) (Priest only, but not useful to Shadow Priests)
---
* [Robe of Power](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7054/robe-of-power) (a level 33 item that's too expensive to care about it for leveling)
---
The [Bloodvine Garb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb) set does give an extra bonus to Tailors with 300 skill, but it is also not useful to Shadow Priests nor is the entire set best-in-slot for Shadow Priests.
---
Except I still have records and spread sheets from my raiding days, as well as well documented change lists for patches we would distribute pre/post patch to guild.  While I see your point, there is also a counter point to be made stemming directly from this main thread, that the servers will be tuned differently than the private servers.  Meaning all of the core math behind the builds being distributed is flawed from the beginning.  You cannot look down on someone while standing on a house of cards.
---
The difference is, I am not claiming to have definitive answers, simply old experience that does not coincide with what the elitists are saying.
---
Okie dokie
---
Yeah I'd say so, maybe I should sue them and get some real gold! Also lucky for my PvP rank to depreciate to that rank for that screenie :)
---
No thanks. Most new players will be Fortnite zoomers here to ruin the game and say "pog" at every possible opportunity. They are the reason we have layering. Will only guild with people who played private servers or actual vanilla.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
3k active per realm is all that's needed to thrive. Hopefully the new players all quit leaving servers full of true enthusiasts that love the game for what it was.
---
This doesn't make you a ninja looter, no. It doesn't justify anyone looking down on you or giving you shit either. However, it does feel bad and is probably the main reason I personally won't be grouping outside of my guild during the phase 1 5-man gearing period.  
---
    
---
It's not a moral dilemma to me, but it does drive a wedge between players, and you could lose out on potential friends and other positive relationships, so I wouldn't recommend it until the main spec BiS farm is over.  
---
At least just tell people that you intend to roll on X &amp; Y items up front, so noone gets surprised.
---
I actually like that hellfire kills me tbh
---
There's nothing wrong with it, but I'm pretty sure the post is addressing those who are giving the impression to people new to vanilla WoW that the DPS specs for most hybrid classes are going to be worth playing when they really probably won't be.
---
I did not know that. But I am kinda expecting it to be there. It would not make much sense to leave it out imo.
---
And the rep bonus isn't too bad, especially for pvp factions.
---
Thanks mate :)
---
The daily countdown posts and people who want to be put into a medically-induced coma until classic release are ruining it for me.
---
Thanks KorK, definitely some things need resolving, hope they get there in the end!
---
&gt; To all who say "why start with Classic when you are new to mmo's?"
---
Would people play Wolfenstein 3D or Doom as their first FPS?
---
Why is it stupid?
---
Could you point me in the direction of the best forums to discuss this with others?
---
I mean the rewards for doing LFR right now are so terrible there is no point in actually doing it unless you're an ultra casual who wouldn't raid otherwise.  Queued content in general is pretty much irrelevant now, M+ isn't hard and its spamable plus it gives better gear than any queued content.
---
Cryptstalker is great, yea. It's just way out of my reach. I don't plan on raiding much, if at all. I like 5 man dungeons alot, but I'm not a fan of 20 and 40s. 
---
So unless I hit a high PvP rank I'll be stuck using I guess Giantstalker at best, which is kinda goofy looking with those pads.
---
I've tried to getting it confirmed on the beta but it's hard when the level cap is 40, the item is still affected by resists, but it worked back in vanilla so it should work in classic.
---
&gt;  For me it's fun to create spreadsheets to write down all this kind of things. Sometimes I feel it's even more fun than playing the game itself.
---
Me too!
---
How long did you play Eve Online?
---
A much better solution to layering is dynamic respawn timers, that change based on how many players are in the area. That would get rid of the influx of players waiting to do quests in the starting zones.
---
Don't underestimate the addictiveness of vanilla WoW. That game is what made WoW, all of the expansions have just been riding its cotails. Most twitch streamers will move on and many players will leave, but servers won't suddenly become ghost towns after a month.
---
Show her cooking and tailoring. That Will teach her.
---
my original post is responding to the topic posted here.  
---
he asked if he should get tailoring for the bloodvine set.  
---
again, thank you for proving my point.  not sure why you are upset when we are literally agreeing
---
I remember him, the ulduar video is probably the one I remember the most
---
One does not simply read this without hearing their voices
---
It's not the only reason for me, but the deciding factor in me choosing Paladin over others was, in fact, the Charger class mount.  
---
And the T2 armor set, but I'm unlikely to be able to raid enough to actually get that so....the horse it is!
---
Oh, I read it fine. 
---
Leveing two characters to 60 with some gimmicky bullshit in 80% of the time it takes someone to level a single character is not a disadvantage.
---
Addons?
---
If you will find 40 other ppl that will want to boost you and agree that you get the sulfuras, play enh, you can play anything. Just dont expect the spec itself gonna contribute anything to the raid group. Shaman as a class will bring a lot of utility, right, but enh spec bring literally nothing and makes possibly the worst dps, as someone here said possibly below tanks/offtanks. And trust me it will be the most boring exprience out of all vanilla dps specs, funny sulfuras compilations are funny. But they are compilations for a reason
---
Which is always funny to me because tanks are rare and required. It’s literally biting the hand that feeds you.
---
One of my fondest moments was in FF11, I was the tank, my buddy was the healer. The DPS was giving us shit so we said “fuck you, we are going for a smoke break, when we get back you all better quit being a bitch”. 30 minutes later they were there just waiting because it could easily take an hour to get a group going as a DPS.
---
Well they won't ever go back to Classic designs in retail, so people asking for group finder to be removed aren't ever going to see that happen.
---
But what they can do is take classes back to where they were better. They already had them balanced and great. I don't know why they need to reinvent the wheel, and threw out all that class design. It took them years to get to a great spot, and they didn't know when to chill out and focus on other things.
---
They could also stop ditching other great design like class halls. And mage tower.
---
What they need is a horizontal expansion, not another vertical one. Put some attention into what has been created already. Basically abandoning old expansions is a trap.
---
This is the way to do it right here. Bonus points for using the back button for autorun.
---
Insisting a spouse treat the other like a child, instead of having a micro conversation, for fear that they may no longer share your hobby, is precisely coddling.
---
Interesting. I've always enjoyed the 30-40 grind, only because I enjoy doing dungeons even if they're not optimal. The scarlet dungeons are my favorite.
---
This actual quality content.
---
It causes me physical pain to play as Alliance.
---
Ugh I fucking love Howling Fjord. I can't wait for WotLK classic

Dude his point is that the class fantasy of a hunter only using a bow is a wow fantasy not a hunter fantasy. He’s saying that the only reason that it “ruins” class fantasy is because it’s not like it was before. But that has nothing to do with actual hunter fantasy.
---
So you’re agreeing with him.
---
Okie dokie mon
---
That said, if you don't mind healing for a while you can have a lot of fun wit off spec gear or just odd spec gear.  Like loads of +damage/heal on a paladin and aoeing hard.
---
We aren't agreeing. You didn't say "don't take Tailoring because you can wear Bloodvine without it", you said "Shadow Priests don't need Bloodvine".
---
Hahaha YES! That’s awesome, glad you enjoyed it.
---
Check the video out at around 1 min
---
https://youtu.be/ntBxBqcFQeg
---
You wanna play this enh as a tank? Is that what you mean?
---
Lame. 1/2 of wow is horde, about 1/10th of that video has horde shit. Also, no toons? This video could have been the new Morrowind and no one would be the wiser (except for the last 1min of horde buildings)
---
I dont care if theyve worked hard on it are not, if its trash its trash and imma say it
---
Write it! Write it now! The people demand it!
---
Great post mate, really enjoyable read.
---
Just a few years. Lived in wormholes with my friend in a small corp (just the two of us and alts). I have to say that EVE provides one of the most unique experiences that there are available out there.
---
Maybe if Ragnaros himself rose briefly from the core to tell me “WELL DONE MORTAL!  YOU HAVE THROWN 100 ENEMIES IN TO HALLOWED FURNACE OF MY MOUNTAIN!  ACCEPT THESE PANTS AS A TOKEN OF MY SATISFACTION!”  
---
Otherwise I was kind of hoping to get me pants tonight.
---
all pvp gets ruined after aq and naxx anyway
---
I played a shadow priest as my main character in vanilla wow from 2004-2006, and my primary professions were enchanting and tailoring. I thought enchanting in vanilla was useful, and i was glad i had it. However, tailoring i regretted. Tailoring is so useless when you're max level. It's mostly good for making leveling gear for yourself as you level. The other useful thing about tailoring is making bags. But you can always just have an alt with tailoring make bags for you since bags are not bind-on-pickup.
---
I would recommend that you NOT take tailoring. I would recommend enchanting, alchemy, or engineering. Engineering is good because it gives you useful tools for pvp and dps-increasing tools for pve. Skinning (or herbalism or mining) is okay to take for making money as you level, but once you're max level, you'll want to eventually swap skinning/mining/herbalims for enchanting/alchemy/engineering in the long run.
---
In the long run (at max level), being able to make your own pots and/or enchant your own gear, and/or make/use your own engineering gadgets is way way way more useful to you than being able to skin mobs and sell/use the skins. Farming things like skins/ore/herbs (and making bags via tailoring) are what alts are for.
---
&gt; I raided in a very competitive guild. 
---
There you go.
---
Exactly. It is a wow fantasy aka part of the class identity as a wow class. My point was that that was part of the class identity that was lost. And it was. Did you comment on the wrong post?
---
I swear, we have a thread for every class/race combo now.
---
How old is payo
---
His videos get posted here often and get stuck in my head again. Like [Ni Hao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dkkf5NEIo0).
---
Lmfao
---
14 runs for the whole set is pretty fast. I know several pallys that did 50+ runs and sat on 3 pieces (me included 😭).
---
We just seem to have a different point of view here.
---
Have fun in BGs
---
The hunter pvp gear is rad too
---
That's my fave episode of EE&amp;E
---
Good plan. Best of luck with your adventures!
---
1 and 2 is what I rant about the most. If classic moves forward on it's own paths these are a MUST.
---
Good list.
---
It's 2 weeks before launch
---
Ret brings Kings so that Holy doesn't gimp itself spending useless points in armor or redoubt at to get it. Don't know enough on the other classes.
---
You have a point, but let's not kid ourselves and pretend that the gaming community from 15 years ago didn't have it's good share of assholes...
---
You need to be a 300 tailor to equip bloodvine i believe. Don't have to be the one to make it though. Other than that you are right unless he wants to craft truefaith vestments for offspec.
---
Someone give this man a trophy, also, OP, ima send you a message about your guild.
---
Theres always noggen fogger?
---
It's mostly craftables, quest rewards and PvP gear for bears anyway.  They're very cheap to geae up extremely well.

This comment right here should really have been more at the forefront of your post, in TBC+ as you stated hybrid classes really came into their own. That being said, there is a real reason why raids post Vanilla were 25 and 10 man, because filling a 40 man was rough. I feel like a lot of people are very misguided in the idea that only pre-raid BiS cookie cutter "viable" specs are going to be filling their raids. I was young 14-16 in Vanilla but was very active and I can remember taking plenty of absolutely garbage people to raids; MC and BWL as literally just bodies that could damage the things or to decurse because that was super important.
---
Thanks! Better worded than I wrote it
---
But remember not to fire until you see the white of their eyes!
---
I raided hardcore from Vanilla - WoTLK.  Nowhere in the posts have I shown any sort of insecurity.  Don't be flippant.  It is widely accepted that the term neckbeard is associated with a no-lifing and taking things to the extreme.  Spending four hours one night a week with only logging on to clear MC is objectively being less serious about than hardcore (neckbeard) raiding culture.
---
Having enough healers is not min maxing.
---
But still, people are like 30-40 years old now....  Anonymity or not, how can folks in this demographic behave like this?  They're not teenagers anymore.  
---
There is off course the other idea that online gaming attracts certain types of personalities.  But I cant explain how that would have changed in the last 20 years.  
---
I remember in the early 2000s that WoW spanned across a range of age demographics (folks in early teens all the way up to late 40s).  That always blew my mind, that a 45 year old guy can raid with a teen, and everyone is getting along and having a good time.  It was something special.  
---
But this stuff doesnt exist anymore.  The teens are toxic, the folks in their late 40s are toxic.  Something has changed.
---
We'll see how the community holds up in Classic.  I'm doubtful but hoping to be surprised.
---
Warrior is "harder" in PvE, Rogue is "harder" in PvP.
---
Quotations because neither is hard by 2019 standards.
---
High dmg, unique skills and specs(no homogenization), world pvp, no flying or significantly reduced flying mounts.  No development based on convenience ie lfg, battle masters,  ect. 
---
To start.
---
Let's go down to ulll duuuu aaaar
---
Yes I know. I'm just saying they didn't really pick a time that was particularly demanding.
---
Lol 2/3 shadowpriests? And yes the content is old but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard purely based on numbers.
---
Easily and quite well.  Threat is fine (in 5 mans you really only have to out threat the healer )  the drinking does get old but it is not unbearable.
---
The dankness of this meme is off the charts
---
Congratulations.
---
But be careful that you haven't played yourself.  You should have started her on a private server instead of a retail starter account.  She may end up wanting to play WoW, but may enjoy retail (and all of its creature comforts) more than Classic.
---
Most of that was 4 horseman and the timing of the release.
---
Work? Me not that kind of orc.
---
Undead warrior!!! Will of the forsaken and cannibalize your enemies
---
its not my fault you are too slow to pick up on the context.
---
I understand quite well how socialism and open borders work thank you very much.
---
You can kill people who are 5-6 levels higher than you as long as you are skilled. When they become level skull to you, spells and melee hits will miss a lot more.
---
But yes, skilled player wins.
---
So are you okay with never raiding past UBRS or MC?
---
I raided as Boomkin in Vanilla, was the #1 rated druid on my server (Vek'nilash) and would after be begged to attend raids as I gave away my inervate and was still reliable top 5 in dps. Hybrid classes weren't sought for literally only 2 reasons:
---
1) Stigma due to people being too stupid to play them right. People thought they were bad because the mechanics were more difficult  (couldn't just span frost bolt like a mage).
---
2) This stigma prevented good players from selecting the specs.
---
It was a vicious cycle. A half decent feral should only do 5-8% less dps than a rogue and provide far more utility with the leader of the pack + inervate. 
---
If you think Vanilla will be anything like it once was you're either an idiot or never played on a private sever.
---
He was not the only one that made parody music Sharm, Abandonation, GiGi, EmberIsolte, SilverLetomi, Decision just to name a few also made some cool music
---
Level 30's druids landing rank 1 FF on level 60 rogues was so much fun.
---
Right? Totally.
---
That story is epic haha.
---
I made a spreadsheet at work with the characters I'm going to make. Their name, race, gender, class, spec, professions, whether to train in first aid, cooking or fishing. Which order they'll get riding training. 
---
Then which professions they'll switch to after a certain point. 
---
Even my bank alts are on there. 
---
So... yeah... you're not the only one.
---
Going by this sub, everyone and their mom cleared it.
---
Your info is outdated pure and simple, I dont see any malice in your post or responses but things have come a long way since Vanilla and that should be the point we as a community start from, not trying to turn people off to what they might want to do or play before launch.
---
&gt; While it was not ninja looting in it's purest form, you gained a certain amount of at least local infamy and at least 4 people not willing to group with you in the future.
---
I was actually applying to a guild at the time.  The whole guild basically blacklisted me.  I think they were #2 at the time.   The guild that I ended up joining surpassed them though.
---
Here's your [confirmation](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=53). (0:53)  
---
Revantusk Village is not a so-called mousetrap, it's sub-60 content that doesn't tie into later releases, as such it will be in from the get-go.
---
This is it. I’m gonna roll (again) boomKING on Vanilla. Who gives a fuck if I won’t get to raid, chicken 4 life.
---
I would be more worried about post 35 fatigue...
---
Life has many doors, Ed boy  :)
---
But will heal worse than a full resto shaman, and damage worse than a full do’s build by other characters, and wouldn’t get picked for raids
---
I am thinking a lot of these elitist jerkwads are coming from private server territory. I played WoW from closed vanilla beta to a bit into Wrath before I quit entirely and I never saw what I see here. Jackasses were called out pretty harshly on my server.
---
The main gray area is hybrid roles.  Like a healer rolling on gear with +damage/healing.  I think it will piss some people off but then others will say it's ok.
---
If you know were to farm/grind 50-60 you can have that money. Yes its absolutley slower. But iv done it on privates. No idea how the market or item drops compare in classic but were about to findout.
---
I always take my 50-60 to farm gold and buy all my pre raid boe BIS items. By the time i hit 60 im decked out in like 3/4ths of my pre raid bis and ready to raid
---
What a stupid, lazy mentality.
---
Rogue is a top contender for me. Cooldown dependent, but such great utility and pvp style. 
---
Have never played a caster for end game, so mage (more gear independent) and lock (a little less independent on gear) are up there as well for me. 
---
Part of the reason I love warriors is tanking dungeons and fury dps in raids. 5 man tanking is just so engaging and fun. I also have a long time priest buddy who I'll be playing with, and we love to pvp. 
---
Thing with rogues and warriors though, is I dont want to go broke on respecing. Warlock is super appealing in that regard. 
---
Will you be rolling a warrior?
---
It’s really not that hard though. The mechanics are so simple. The hard part is organizing large groups of people that are geared enough for the content. MC will be cleared within weeks. I would be surprised if there aren’t guilds that go out of their way to have terrible meta just to make it a faux hard mode so to speak
---
Imagine that you're in a UBRS group and a BoE worth 1000g drops. You're saying it should go to the person that will use it as is instead of selling it. What you're really doing is saving them 1000g off their pre BiS grind. 
---
If you instead let someone who will sell it have it, what are you doing? You're saving them 1000g off their pre BiS grind as well. 
---
Why should it go to the first person when it can go to anyone and have the exact same effect?
---
So far as blizzard designed it, this is meant to be the most gray ambiguous decision there is to make in wow.  They do it in different ways, but the two classes are meant to have similar impact.  
---
That being said, in either pvp or raiding, paladin is superior.  In pvp it is superior because cleanse is strictly better then purge 1 to 1, and paladins add as much or more to their team in survival as the shaman adds to his team in damage.  
---
In raiding the shaman only provides his buffs for a single party of 5, whereas paladin blessings affect all 40 raid members.  
---
In leveling or 5man dungeons this becomes very close.  With the priest primarily healing, doing extra damage s a shaman and and buffing your two melee's damage would be more of a contribution then what a single paladin could add in a 5man situation.  
---
Also shaman wears mail, meaning you would have less wasted loot as shaman leveling in this group. 
---
I am in a similar situation, but the question was more like horde priest(again) or alliance paladin.  I have been pushing my group to go alliance so that I can play paladin heals.
---
The plainstrider war NEVER ENDS. No matter how many we kill, no matter how many we throw at them, THEY JUST KEEP COMING AT US!
---
(A play on the Emu war Australia fought and lost)
---
Well, there you have it:
---
Are you forgetting your own comments?
---
&gt; is this supposed to contradict my post about shadow priests not needing to use bloodvine? it doesn't.
---
You literally said Shadow Priests do not need to use Bloodvine. Fucking moron.
---
Perhaps that what op is trying to do, influence the way members of the community treat each other
---
If you hated every expansion since classic I don’t think you actually objectively like or dislike any of them. Sounds like you chose the childlike mentality of this good everything else bad and stuck with it for a decade. Lmfao.
---
I am going to burn the World tree TO THE GROUND FOR THAT!
---
Imagine that you're in a UBRS group and a BoE worth 1000g drops. You're saying it should go to the person that will use it as is instead of selling it. What you're really doing is saving them 1000g off their pre BiS grind.
---
If you instead let someone who will sell it have it, what are you doing? You're saving them 1000g off their pre BiS grind as well.
---
you need to be level 35 to get over 225
---
Very true, and I do that probably 75% of the time. Unfortunately the other 25% I eat into it lol
---
You down with the sickness?
---
The subset of guilds that takes feral druids to raids will intersect the subset of guilds that clear beyond MC. If not, I'll poop. 
---
That said, I'm playing a warrior this time. Not a feral Druid like I used to.
---
It’s not doomsday, if you don’t mind waiting until phase 3 to clear MC then sure play whatever. I’m saying it’s dishonest to tell people that healer dps characters are viable because they aren’t.
---
Getting to experience it for the first time. I'm a Wotlk baby.
---
Also getting to play Druid since I've never played one, was a Rogue main in retail.
---
Well, remember, he just spent all his gold on the Hourglass Sand.  
---
If he spirit res'd, he wouldn't have been able to repair his gear....... and he'd still not be anywhere near the entrance anyway.
---
In Camp Taurajo, born and raised  
---
On the battleground is where I spent most of my days  
---
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool  
---
And all throwing some A-xes outside of the school  
---
When a couple of guys who were up to no good  
---
Started making trouble in the neighborhood  
---
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared  
---
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Razor Hill"
---
Perhaps. But honestly the people who have been on private servers for the last 4-5 years have gone through numerous fresh servers only to begin again, and again, and again etc. For that hardcore crew, there is no going back to retail or other mmos. For the softcore pserver players like myself there is still tons of content to do, wpvp is always a hoot, and the potential to try and rank. And for the retail players who maybe never played vanilla or the tourists, it will be a brand new world, and what everyone says on the internet may not hold true once the game is actually out like optimal raid this and that, prebis lists from servers that had progressive itemization etc. I think generally you are right though, lots of people WILL find aspects of classic boring compared to the flashy WoW that has been around since late wrath patches and onwards.
---
Classic is also telling paladins and druids to stfu and heal. They should enjoy the full experience.
---
again...bloodvine = bloodvine set.
---
again, its not my fault you are too stupid to read the comment posted and understand i am responding to it.  
---
typical shadow priest shitter...
---
Hope you guys have a good time!
---
Holy fuck we’re on from private server to pirate server to crime server. What are you a piracy cop? Some people wanted to keep playing a game they love that wasn’t made available by Blizzard so they hosted it themselves. Relax.
---
Allowing xpoff players to queue with levelers would be enough for me to subscribe, but my biggest issue continues to be all the stupid mounts. The fact that people are riding around on giant robots and dragons and helldogs or whatever the fuck completely breaks my immersion. Game was better when you got a tiger, a horse, a wolf, or a raptor
---
Nice will check it..ty
---

---
Sweet, more lowbies to murder.
---
why do you think you should tell people how to enjoy a game? your logic is the force behind all classes and specs being homogenized, because players "cant play this spec/class"
---
More Horde filth to be purged. Defiling this continent for far too long.
---
For the Alliance!
---
As I said - nobody really cares much about the dungeon blues on a global scale.
---
Thanks, that actually helps me out on picking a name lol
---
One of my fondest "man was i a noob" in vanilla was dropping everything i had when i was levelling my rogue and going to crossroads to fight as lvl 49 only in complete green "of the monkey" gear lol
---
Back then it was exciting as hell but ppl probably just looked at me going "dude what are you doing here"
---
And treating retardins and noobkins like mental patients that escaped the psych ward.
---
This is the video I was talking about and it is NOT confirmation. He wasn't sure if Thorium Point (another hub that is not a "mousetrap") is in and the other developer later said "if the community wants it, let's talk". They did not mention Hinterlands once.
---
I think that is referring to tbc when shadow priests gained a dot that would return mana. You're stuck in a group with the healers and give them the juice.
---
Can’t tell if you’re kidding or not. 
---
Usually what happens is this - 
---
Guild A is an average guild and they let all specs come. 
---
You have a couple boomkin. You have a spriest. You have some ferals and the weird enhance kid that never talks. 
---
Molten core takes a few months but eventually the raid limps its way through and downs rag and you start to enter BWL. Everyone is very excited.  They’ve seen other guilds already clear BWL and are ready to start their own progress. 
---
But then you hit the first two bosses and they are a complete smack in the face compared to anything in MC.  Everyone starts getting frustrated. 
---
Fingers get pointed - those classes you mentioned are consistently pulling less damage than the tanks and you could really use some more healers.
---
The handful of guys in the raid that do care about min maxing that have been hard carrying your raid through the content to make up for the ret paladins shit dps start getting poached by guilds that are not catering to every little snowflake spec and all of a sudden that guild is dead in the water. 
---
Congrats you made it through MC in your meme spec. You showed all those people on reddit that ret paladin CAN work!   Sure, you won’t mention to anyone that you respecced to holy so you could see the rest of the game or that you rerolled to a different class but you sure showed us how retarded we are with your MC loot while everyone else is clearing AQ40. 
---
That’s what happens. Nearly every fucking time.
---
AV changed a lot during vanilla. 1.12.1 AV, the version we're getting, is basically modern AV without reinforcements. A lot of NPCs were nerfed or removed and it's generally easier to zerg than previous versions.
---
!remindme 3 years
---
Cdew was ele for his latest dueling tourney and it was at level 40. Enhance is a garbage spec
---
As long as he doesn't do the one handed backwards handstand I'm not impressed 😄
---
That applies across the board though.

You're a REALLY engaging writer, my dude or dudette. I missed the first two posts but caught up on them just now, keep them coming, they're fantastic!
---
Mage crit would be affected too no?
---
If only there was a beta test for these kinds of things that didnt end in trivial content before even being halfway leveled to 60
---
Why does Seal Fate always take Endurance and the single point of Dual Wield instead of Murder and a single point in Vile Poisons? Are there some encounters where *maybe* being able to sprint twice clearly yields more than a 2% DPS increase?
---
Why do you take Imp KS? To slightly improve raid damage on stunnable trash mobs?
---
Why Imp Gouge in a raiding build?
---
They *can*, but it sounds to me like they *didn't*, and therefore this isn't ninjaing, and they are wrong in claiming otherwise.
---
No, but there is also no Horde equivalent of Goldshire debauchery.
---
So why would we use this over the much established and implemented into AAP Joanie’s Leveling Guide?
---
As someone who has played Alliance for 99.9% of my WoW Career, I've always respected how much quicker and better the Horde seem to be at grouping up vs the Alliance.  
---
Course, most of us believe it was because they learned "grouping" when Blizzard dropped an instance in their capital a whole ten levels earlier or so than our Stockades- taught at birth vs too old to begin training.

Dont worry.  Lakeshire, Darkshire, Menethil Harbor, Asranaar.

Alliance get it worse and can ALWAYS use the help (and time) of brave souls.
---
I do like that there is a post about this exact topic from this morning and here we are with a new one a few hours later :D
---
&gt; again...bloodvine = bloodvine set.
---
Again, talking out your ass.
---
&gt; shadow priests don't need bloodvine. you can use talent points to get spell hit.
---
You specifically mention spell hit, which has nothing to do with the set bonus.

I remember this. I don't know why I have this particular memory but back not long after release I remember reading minimized out of the game while waiting for my SM group. Good stuff.
---
Giving a shit about anyone around me.  Being part of a social ecosystem and hanging out with people.
---
I'm actually very curious about this post as someone who loves both versions of the game, but sees flaws in both. So if it doesn't come off as rude, I'd like to dissect a lot of these points with the general feeling I see from people as well as my own experience.. because I do feel there's a few curious changes suggested. 
---
&gt; Each expansion, all previous work and item collection becomes pointless outside of nostalgia.
---
Don't disagree here. There's been a clamor for a professions rework for years. I will say there is outliers (IE: Goblin Glider Kits, certain consumables) that have carried over the past few expansions, but over all this is a very prominent complaint about professions even for current players. Now with that mentioned about professions, I do think it's an inevitable problem of expansions, and a lot of this feeling only came with Cataclysm when a lot of vanilla stuff was reworked (IE: Class mounts / Forms, etc etc no longer having their quests and instead just being learn-able by a trainer. The 'soft reset' of expansions is needed, and I think we see the effect of the lack of such by the Naxx phase of Vanilla/Classic. A lot of things would tumble beyond just being OP and into the territory of straight unenjoyable if we added, say, a raid tier after Naxx without a stat weight reset. 
---
&gt; Flying Mounts would either have to go or be entirely reworked.
---
So this was the one that actually made me raise my brow. Since WoD, flying mounts have not actually been available for the majority of each expansion. In WoD, we did not get the ability to fly until the final raid patch. In Legion, we did not get it until Tomb of Sargeras, which was the 4th of 5 raids in the expansion. In BfA, we only just got the ability to fly this week. Nearly a full year after the launch of the expansion.. and generally, this pleases everyone. Or at least leaves them content. 
---
The idea of removing flying outright was reacted to VERY badly in WoD. I'm very against flying myself, but the best I can possibly suggest is that Flying be disabled entirely on War Mode. Which is very much possible, if War Mode can get a more stable population.  
---
&gt; Zone, quest and crafting design need to make people backtrack to other zones and old content to keep everyone part of the same community.
---
This has been a major improvement in Legion and BfA. There's still a ways to go, but they've massively improved how much you visit old zones and locations. The problem is those zones and locations are still empty either way. More as a result of the mess that is leveling as of right now. 
---
&gt; "20 Daily Quests" has to go.
---
8.2, the patch that just launched last week, is the first time we've had meaningful daily quests in the game since MoP. Dailies were more or less entirely replaced by World Quests, which have almost never given gold. The current gold inflation was a result of the Command Tables in your Garrison / Order Hall. 
---
Dailies definitely affected gold inflation previously, but this is the first time they've really existed in a meaningful manner since 2014. 
---
&gt; Raid design
---
&gt; but every class or and spec should be optimal or necessary for different encounters in dungeons either because of mechanics, crowd control, buffs or something that cannot easily be substituted or forgotten about.
---
So again. Something on this list that's actually a thing in game currently, and is actually.. pretty disliked. Especially by me. 
---
This works in the Classic raid environment because you have 40 people. Even in the BC enviorment of 25 this also somewhat worked.. 
---
But ever since WotLK, there's been a general preference of 10~ man raiding by a lot of the community. As of currently, there's three modes to a raid. Normal, Heroic, and Mythic. Normal and Heroic have scaling (flexible) raid sizes so you can take anywhere from 10-30 people. Mythic is a strict 20. 
---
I explain this because, there have been several fights in BFA where you basically might as well just stop for the night without a certain class, or multiple of them. In Uldir, not having a Priest for Mass Dispel was an absolute nightmare for Zul. Something unique to them. In the same raid, G'huun at the end was made significantly more difficult based on how few Warlocks you had (Needing two). 
---
Now, in context to peope familiar with classic. Two sounds like nothing.. but when most people playing the game are running somewhere between 10-15 players in a raid, and there's 12 classes, it becomes a problem in raid design. 
---
Combine that with generally unique buffs again in BFA and a pretty hard push for classes to have unique utility again, and you'll be surprised to find that despite that, class design is absolutely hated in this expansion. 
---
People are just too competitive now a-days, and that competitive viability is always placed over unique utility and design. I mean, you can even see it on this subreddit in reference to Classic. Where people laugh at the idea of even fitting one sub-par spec into a group of 40 regardless of unique utility / buffs. 
---
&gt; Item design
---
Again, I'm going to give credit where credit is due. If you poked me six months ago I would have been 100% on board with this criticism, but Crucible of Storms, Mechagon, and Nazjatar (and both of their dungeons/raids) have completely been a 180 of this. Especially with Mechagon. Item design has made huge leaps and bounds into being unique again and not just an ilvl decision. My personal favorite has been the If/Then rings from Mechagon, which to explain.. Is about 10(?) rings which have either "If" or "Then" statements as their effects. So as an example it's written as "If you attack your target from behind.." So you equip (Once you get) one 'If' statement ring, which determines how the effect is activated, and then you equip a 'Then' statement ring to determine what that effect is that the 'If' statement is triggering. 
---
If the item design they've been pushing this second half of BfA continues, than this concern already has been addressed. 
---
&gt; Moving away from Arena PvP Balance
---
As someone who personally -hates- Arenas.. I'll entirely agree. Although to try and take my bias out of that statement, I would further explain my experience as of the last week or two. 
---
So with the launch of 8.2, there has been a system added called Azerite Essences, which are another character trait customization you gather through various different activities. In this case, some of them are from PvP. 
---
So, I play on what was previously a PvE server, and there are a LOT of people in my guild who absolutely hate PvP, but have been pushed to do BG's due to the Essences. 
---
What did I find out? Most of their awful experiences have been because of friends pushing them to do Arenas. I've genuinely brought three people who have been actively playing the game for years, into their very first BG's. With no joke. One of them has been playing since Cataclysm, and has never done a simple Warsong Gulch until I got them to try it this week..
---
and they've loved it. 
---
WoW has always thrived on being a casual MMO. People may say otherwise comparing Classic to now, but WoW at any point of it's "At the time" existence has always been on the more casual side of its competition. Even Classic was very casual-friendly because of the leveling experience being such a major part of the game. Where as now it's barely an afterthought. 
---
Not to get sidetracked, but my point is the shift away from BG's and towards Arenas has been a shift that has pushed a good amount of players away from PvP in general. Myself included. BG's are simply much easier to participate in regardless of how competitive you are. There's a handful of reasons Rated BG's failed, and that's one of them. 
---
&gt; "Talents" and "Perks"
---
I don't really think pushing people into a single spec more is healthy for the game. We've seen the effects of such with Azerite Gear and the overwhelming response has been "Why is this spec specific?"
---
I do think additional customization would be good, but I also think it would be best done in a manner that essentially is a Class Tree that goes in combination with your Specialization Tree. 
---
The problem with spec specialization like you suggest is really the only problem with it in the Classic Talent Trees -- It affects certain classes more than others. 
---
But that gets into the whole "Hybrid Tax" argument which the weight of such varies a lot from class to class as well. 
---
&gt; Allow people to be elitist assholes with their OP gear.
---
Again, I don't disagree here. There's a reason BC is my favorite progression design of raiding. It was a nice balance of catch up mechanics along with keeping multiple tiers of raids relevant. 
---
But it goes both ways. In Legion, we had a lot of incentive with Legendaries to run old raids after we cleared our current content, and that was fun. 
---
Unfortunately, I think the reason they keep with it is because of server population issues. On my server, I see maybe 4 guilds on Alliance (Including my own) gather regularly for raids. So we're quite literally talking a single raid team for Classic worth of people actively participating in raiding on a low-medium pop server. 
---
If server merges were more well-received by the community, I wouldn't be surprised if this eventually returned.. but right now the majority of servers simply can't benefit from it. It would likely just result in more transfers to the mega servers.
---
I pvp'd pretty heavily in vanilla, but there's a bunch of oddball things to consider here. 
---
For one, we're going to have a bit of a mixing of eras as druids were on the older talent system when the pvp system released, so there were not HotW druids at that specific phase. You "could" be feral, but instead you were probably 8/11/32 for maximum utility.
---
For the world pvp patch, people are going to get honor just by being on kills, whether healing or landing a single moonfire. That kinda makes that particular phase a bit of a wash.
---
Once warsong gulch opens up you have an avenue to earn your team a lot of honor capping flags, but the people who are on your team and also getting kills are going to get more honor than you, unless you're just putting in more hours than them. And as far as gear for that goes, it's really just about speed and utility. Get your 3 piece set bonus, maybe have engineering and/or the blacksmithing trinket, get the hammer from dire maul if you don't already have a warden staff, etc. There's just not really a lot of upgrades from our blue set outside of the raids and PvP rewards at that point. I think I recall WSG bracers and legs being pretty decent, and you'll already be farming that.
---
Arathi Basin obviously grind exalted for shoulders. There's also a crafted cloak at some point that is decent.
---
All that said, almost all stats can be useful in pvp. I personally tried some weird things like an all-resists set that was actually pretty funny for flag running (smoking heart of the mountain, amberseal keeper, mark of tyranny) that might be dumb but worked well enough.
---
Hah! Good idea!B
---
Pre-bis list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#
---
PVE gear == PVP gear in vanilla (beyond the honor sets)
---
If you are solo pvping, run a set of cat or bear gear, and if you are running with a group or a partner, you probably want more caster pieces.
---
Note: Dire maul is not going to be available on launch
---
#juststreamerthings
---
I had almost 2000 Dishonorable Kills on my Dwarf Hunter, Kili on Dragonblight before they removed them.  I haven't played him since. He's wearing Herod's plate shoulder as we speak. (hunter plate, duh)
---
Would be better to just have the holy paladin than the Kings buff plus the damn near negative dps they provide.
---
The game is going back to vanilla lol
---
I’m just saying that healer classes are expected to heal, and people will likely not want to play with a prot paladin, or shadowpriest, or other hybrids for end game. That’s how it was then, it’s likely to be how it is now.
---
Thanks, the Druid is having some internet issues so, here we go with that authentic style xp.
---
Honestly, they're still too big.  The proportions on some races are all bunk.
---
Here's a question. Is the druid pve feral spec viable in pvp or do u need to respect?
---
Why does this kill it  for you. You dont have to do lfr, its literally just a way for noobs to enjoy content without having to grind a bunch. I dont get these sentiments when its options you have a problem with. If youre only enjoying things cause ur forced into it idk why it even matters.
---
I like the Addon but the Guide is kinda weird and probably pretty slow. Darkshore is one of the best Ally Zones, ignoring that is really stupid and will slow you down. Westfall in comparison is super bad and barely has any quests. Loch Modan isn't much better.
---
The whole point of layering is to avoid server merges............
---
Yeah I'd say it's 5 or 6 runs if you're entering from Searing Gorge, but he was entering from Burning Steppes.
---
His first death was only a few feet onto the bridge.  [It's a pretty long bridge to run.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ufAMbs8GUHE/UBpkorTAikI/AAAAAAAAAO4/PXD0ivWVmKg/s1600/Skjermbilde+2012-07-27+kl.+18.26.43.png)  Takes 2-3 corpse runs just to get across the bridge.  Then you gotta go uphill to the left.  That's another 2-3 at least.  By the time you're near the chain/stairs it's probably at least another 2-3.  This is just from my own corpse running memories though :).
---
Luckily I didn't really ever experience the Mind Control hijacking into the lava thanks to Will of the Forsaken :)
---
What? Rets can easily provide more dps than any of the dps checks require. Plus why would you add another holy paladin when you've already got your healers figured out.
---
which old mounts did you get?
---
Yup, they were called mana batteries.
---
Absolutely. You may have your 40 people planned out then 15 minutes before the raid one guy goes AFK for no reason, another guy has to go because the baby woke up, another guy's internet is down (ok this one is less likely), and another guy rage quits because he isn't in line for loot. Next thing you know you're bringing level 59 alts from the guild and randoms.
---
For my wife, it was all about herbalism. OOH FLOWERS! I would get annoyed that we ALWAYS had to go pick every herb. But she loved it. I'm sure your gal will love some aspect of the game, too. Don't crush it.
---
Also, don't underestimate the power of the "Barbies factor." She will LOVE dressing her character up in the coolest stuff. Help her get it. Make her look super cool and she will love playing.
---
Yeah, it’s a lot easier once PvP sets are released.  Looking for something to aim for before that happens tho.  Seeming like I’ll be on my own as far as what gear to aim for... which is kind of fun in its own way I guess
---
Make mana a thing again. Right now having 100% mana for the full duration of a boss fight makes no sense.
---
A couple of friends killed a level 60 shadowpriest a few weeks ago at around lvl 35-36 on our way to SM. We dispelled all his dots until he ran out of mana and offed him twice. It was so satisfying taking group pictures on his corpse!
---
Moonkins, elemental Shamans and tankadins unite! 
---
You too Shadow Priests!
---
TBH, I think no one would ever guess that an Enchancement Shaman would try to roll need on that staff
---
This isn't Samsung vs Apple.
---
You just have both options. Pick what suits you.
---
If autoattacking for 3-4 hours straight and ending below tank is what you are looking for then hey, you found yourself a perfect spec
---
Quality meme
---
all spec have purpose, not just raiding.  ^^^^^except ^^^^^moonkin
---
We have a meaning, a cause. We're not bound together by gold, loot and coincidence.
---
All of us fight for something larger than that, something that weaves our destinies together and permeate the very essence of our being. Because we, the Horde, we do it for the *poon*.
---
I'm going to say that there isn't enough information provided for what you want to do to make an accurate recommendation. If your goal is to purely be casual and enjoy 1-60 leveling and only do 5/10man dungeons at 60 with zero hopes at raiding, then Pally tank is sufficient (just more challenging). If you ever have real hopes of raiding beyond MC/ZG/AQ20, then unfortunately a Paladin/druid tank really won't cut it. When you get to Naxx level, I would be pretty shocked to see non-warrior tanks in the raid if your guild was serious at clearing the whole raid.
---
Yeah, no thanks to point 9...

Imma pop a arrowhead in yo ass fool
---
Dusk wood is such a great zone I miss it (the new one is bleh)
---
Is that Michael Fassbender?
---
Sadly yes...
---
Feral Druids bearly (lol) squeak by as tanks, but pretty much every other hybrid was forced to heal in vanilla. Maybe this was different on Pservers, but believe me... I was a paladin back then... you had to be holy to get a raid invite.
---
I hear that maybe if you don't mind running gnomer like a million times cat druids might be ok too.
---
People really underestimate how big of dicks raid leaders were about this back in the day.
---
"Oh but we need a shadow priest for shadow weaving right?" Wrong. You can do the same thing with a 0/31/20 priest that uses an occasional sw:pain or mind blast between healing. Shadow Priests took 3 debuff slots, shadow weaving (good one), sw:pain (not great), mind flay (terribad) and then your dps was mediocre, and it was hard to find healers in end game content.
---
Ret / Prot paladins and Enh / Ele Shaman and Moonkin weren't allowed in either. I hope it's different in the re-release, but if it goes like it did originally it won't happen. (I personally really hope that the spell power ret paladin stuff on private servers is correct, but I have my doubts).
---
As if the people who had been waiting on him for so long would not drop a bot and give him a few gold to repair so they could get on with BWL.
---
And you responded to that by saying 
---
Which clearly means you weren't talking about the set bonus, you were talking about the individual pieces. Which is wrong.
---
And then when corrected, you said
---
&gt; you do know there are other items with hit on it?
---
That was your opportunity to say, "I meant the set as a whole" (which still has nothing to do with +hit), but instead you doubled down.
---
You've only now come up with this dumbass excuse of "I meant the set as a whole" even though you clearly did not.
---
&gt; That quest *might* be in.
---
He confirms that quests related to raids like AQ/Naxx won't be in the game at launch and then states that he thinks that stuff like Thorium Point could be in from the start but that he *can't confirm*.
---
Nah, just don’t care enough to argue about it anymore.  Have a good day
---
Yeah, this would have been a good plan and is pretty standard... but I even addressed all of those points in my actual post.  That plan wasn't possible.
---
The entrance, inner mountain, and instance portal were all camped by Horde.  The instance portals were always the most heavily camped areas because that's where they knew all of the traffic would be (including summoning portals).
---
They wouldn't have even been able to get a Summoning Portal off that night.  They would have zoned out and been dead before the loading screen ended.
---
&gt; Maybe people disagree, but I don’t feel any real sense of gratefulness to private servers or the people who run them. I don’t credit them for classic coming back, but if you do that’s fine.
---
How horribly ignorant.
---
Remove the skinnerbox things from the game. 
---
People that have been playing games for so long are used to these gimmicks.  They aren't fun.  They don't provide enjoyment.  Just give us challenge and mechanics and let the player figure out how to overcome that challenge with the mechanics.  That's what makes a game fun.  It's definitely not Ion telling us all what our rotations are and removing anything from the game that adds any variability to that.
---
I mean, some people just wanna play a class fantasy though. 
---
Also, not everyone's a raider. A really good friend of mine rolled feral druid in pvp, not even to be a flag carrier, and he was solid af. He knew how to play the class and the r10 pvp gear was plenty, most of the time. He had a blast.
---
Bravo
---
Yes, that's the [original meme.](https://pics.me.me/l-prefer-the-real-micheal-fassbender-i-said-the-real-29965770.png)
---
that guild leader deserved his fate
---
clearly you are wrong because the topic is the bloodvine set.  again, you are too stupid to understand context.
---
Quality content!
---
Sooo that’s entirely up to the guild but if you wanted to do both for sure I’d prob play a priest or eye shaman because some of the loot can be used for both specs where as druids/pallys it’s entirely different
---
This is the content I crave. Everyone give me your vanilla stories! Memes are yesterday's news. Stories are the future.
---
I don't care enough about the subject to sit here and discuss this all night. I have already laid out why I have come to my conclusion logically. I'm not interested in a pissing contest with a small person so petty that he immediately downvotes my responses.
---
Galatians 4:16
---
You should probably start with that next time instead of getting overly defensive about facts and responding to *me*
---
Since I don't play retail I always forget that they changed it where you don't get abilities from other specs.  That's just strange.
---
You have brought your own ruin, Ed-Boiii
---
This is amazing
---
When you say "redesigning of entire races" do you mean mechanically or how they put blood elves on horde to balance out the population?
---
I can not tell if you are being serious right now. You seem a bit out of touch with reality, on multiple levels. Not only can you not detect when someone is making a joke, you unironically use a fake nonsense word like "ageism", and even after all that you manage to squeeze in the typical obsession about Donald Trump.
---
I must be getting memed on here. It's all too surreal.
---
Not saying this is how it should, will, or may be, just that if it were hardcore RP rules it wouldnt not happen.
---
I'd gladly pass on a BoE epic that was great for someone in the group, and I'm sure they'd appreciate it and remember it.  There are things in the game more important than gold.
---
Lol well I didn't specifically search reddit. I googled it.
---
Your last sentence is exactly what I’m trying to say, it’s an uphill battle
---
It’s not impossible but much harder to see any endgame content
---
How doesn't it make sense? A joke is a unit of culture. 
---
I think the source of our disagreement here is that you don't understand what a unit of culture actually is.
---
I think if you log on without gametime you get a pop up where you can buy a token with the gold you have on that character. I remember doing that once
---
Poggers! I'll probably be level 23 in 36 hours!
---
To follow this up, you can go both Herbalism and Skinning early to make profits for your level 40 mount (save all your herbs in the bank for alch). Right around 40 once you bought your mount, switch Skinning for Alchemy and rush it up. That way you start getting pots for the 'harder' levels of leveling and can get your transmutes going prior to 60.
---
Like I explained above:
---
Westfall in this guide have no pre-required quests and won't unlock any quest-chains for other zones (except one minor turn-in to Wiley the Black in Redridge. Nothing after it).
---
It's a standalone zone.
---
After that you pick up AllyRoute again at **16-20 Loch Modan**.
---
I’m 100% decided on priest so that’s cool. Undead or troll is the biggest question ha
---
We
---
pulled
---
up at seven or eight in Durotar
---
and I yelled to the flightmaster:
---
Yo homes
---
Lok'tar!
---
lets leave it at this
---
i am sorry i thought you were smart enough to understand the context of the conversation.  i should not have assumed that when talking to you and next time i will state things more clearly so people like you (stupid) can understand what is being discussed.
---
i thought i was talking to someone who was experienced in the game, my mistake
---
The reality is the MT does compete for loot with dps warriors. He needs threat gear. He wants onslaught, he wants chromatic boots, etc. Thats just the way it is
---
It has a ~20% drop chance. That means you need to do BRD 10 times to have a 90% probability of seeing it drop once and 21 times to have a 99% chance.
---
The liklihood of finding that many runs in the ~2 months between Phase 2 and Phase 3 that don't include at least one melee DPS that also wants the item are pretty slim.
---
If you're a Hunter and Hand of Justice drops and the melee DPS in the group are not your guildmates, you should roll on it.
---
Sure thing buddy, maybe learn to differentiate between a conversation and a debate in the future.
---
Undead fo sho imo the racial is extremely useful for breaking cc in pve and pvp
---
so guud
---
I'm with you all the way. Got the same feeling
---
The wheel weaves as the wheel wills
---
Yeah, fuck you too kid. You were wrong and are now trying to cover it up with excuses that make zero sense given what you previously said.
---
I had to rewatch that scnee on YT and after the hit Eddy says "Oh, look. We found another Note".
---
Guess they were looking for the pages of the Green Hills of Stranglethorn!
---
Joke right ?
---
Ever saw someone from the pendulum guild ? 
---
I was a Tauren shaman Abb and belf tankadin lazorr.
---
The fact that you think I was ever having a conversation with you explains a lot
---
Thank god there will be PVE servers. PVP servers- once and never again.
---
Yeh and dev plague/inner focus combo. Shadow orbs seem fun tho 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I am leaning way more towards undead though
---
you answered your own question lol
---
How my orc will ideally look after some raiding: https://imgur.com/ck9JqEP
---
I played for free a couple of months ago. I don't use any heritage armor.
---
First of all, what are those motorcycles everybody's using? Heritage mounts for level 1 characters that can't wait for level 20 to get the almost free mount?
---
Anyway, I got to level 15 and jumped straight into tanking dungeons. No challenge at all. By the end of my first evening playing I was at level 20 with pretty much the best possible gear (mix of blues/purples) and at the trial account gold cap.
---
One evening, and I was left wondering why I would want to bother spending a second evening.
---
I can't wait for Classic.
---
I just feel bad for the majority of the new players who will get to 60 and get crushed by others saying their class is useless
---
Also everyone mentions feral druids but nobody wants to say how useless a ret paladin or prot paladin was
---
my fiance and i played just that, me as a mage and she played priest. we made a great duo.
---
&gt; Those are fantastic things that persist in any role-playing game. If you think WoW could exist without gear or levels persisting, I don't see how progression would ever work. You'd be basically playing Second Life.
---
I'm not the one arguing for less world persistence and community cohesion. That's your stance.
---
&gt;And you know what? You likely WILL see that warrior who helped you kill Hogger three months ago, because Layering WILL end. 
---
I don't believe it will. 
---
We've gone from "Classic will not have any sharding, it has no place." to "Classic will only shard the beginner zones for the first few days to help ease player congestion" to "We know you don't want this but we're sharding the whole bitch. Fuck you, you'll like it because we said so."
---
&gt;Also, you're contradicting yourself within your own argument, here. You're saying layering will lead to just playing in empty shards. Yet you'll be ganked by enemy factions, so will it be empty? Or will there be other players?
---
Now I know you're trolling. 
---
&gt;And yes, there is such a thing as too many players. Private servers have a fraction of the audience of WoW, they have problem on Fresh launches. Just look at the stress test of servers. There are too many players right out of the gate.
---
I've played at the launch of MMO's since 1996. It is *always* chaos for the first day or so and then it smooths out. But now we're stuck with layering, which is so against what Classic stands for that it's a fundamentally changed product. Because instant gratification won out over sensible choices. So grats on that.
---
Also, the sharding we got ***isn't even going to address early zone overcrowding.*** That's straight from Blizzard's mouth.
---
&gt;Y'know what, actually, go play Second Life if ALL you care about is community. There's more to WoW than that, and if gameplay is to be preserved at all, then there needs to be accounting for simply too many people.
---
Nice try, but I already quit BfA because it was terrible. For the exact reasons that Classic was supposed to fix. No more lobby game waiting in a queue. No more auto joining a group of people you'll never see again or speak to in the first place for a ~3 minute daily quest, no more "I right clicked the NPC now I fly to the yellow circle then collect reward" gameplay.
---
WoW is already Second Life, and Classic is going the same route.
---
&gt;You're being hyperbolic and dramatic with rather little to back up any of your claims.
---
You seem confused, you're the one that thinks the sharding we got is going to help with initial zone overpopulation, which according to Blizzard it's not designed to. 
---
I guess me and /u/BeholdTheHair can go cry in our beer for what might have been. Mayhaps when Classic launches a private server can use the data and make a server that does it right.
---
How do you get naked when your bags only have 3 open slots?
---
Lol. Quotes bible verses and then thinks anyone will take his "logical conclusions" seriously. GTFO.
---
Orc axes is still better for tank than wearing leather dagger gear though.
---
Impressive! Significantly faster than the 43:28 time Joana just completed.
---
Idk, I have been playing private servers on and off for about 2-3 years now.  I have found community just as much as I did during vanilla.  If not more so, due to how awesome our Internet and Discord is compared to shiity internet and Vent/TS from 2005.
---
I thought it was only me, I was even reading this out loud my wife sitting next to me said whatcha saying?!
---
Why do people need proof of faster internet before this is resolved? The issue has been dealt with in retail with modern internet infrastructure.
---
Most definitely in a PUG. For all I know the next guy will quit the game tomorrow, he's the guy AFKing in AV, or some serial dog molester. And besides, it's only fair since everyone gets to roll for it.
---
Yes, the topic is the bloodvine set, but you weren't talking about the set, you were talking about the individual pieces, otherwise you wouldn't have mentioned +hit at all.
---
The term, i'm joking is a unit of culture lol. Gotta listen to yourself its gold.
---
Its parte of the fun u will never see it again
---
Agree with this advice. Also, one thing to remind your warrior friend is that bubbles are not his best friend as it reduces the amount of rage he gains (not that you will probable be using them all that much, but an easy thing you can remind your friend of if you want to be primarily holy).
---
In my humble opinion, this, with mining.
---
Best uptime, least dps lost. Why would anyone else nightfall?
---
Where is the list or rules that says you can't pot? If duels didn't allow pots the game wouldn't let you use them during a duel
---
wot. u literally right click the pillars to deactivate them and you can do it in stealth. how is this possible. was the guild leader the only rogue
---
Ive been looking for my Ipod/online playlist from 2004 just to get in the Classic WoW mood before it comes out! I shed a happy tear every day that I look at this subreddit and read about Classic..
---
Call me pathetic but I know you guys are just as excited as me!
---
FOR THE HORDE!!
---
Sure, if your raid group was set.
---
But then I'd be pretty hard to get into a full raid group with a resto shaman you barely want to log on for except raiding. There are trials, raid drops you don't want, and finally you get the Lokamir from nef and gquit the same day. You'll do the same for AQ40.
---
Or you can just find a guild that isn't a bunch of tryhards and progress while healing as 30/0/21 shaman or even 41/0/20 moonkin druid and be pretty much fine, hey you might even temporarily respec for nef progression because you like your guild. No ones cares if you're dpsing trash as a hybrid anyway.
---
Thunderclucks
---
I think I'm just gonna play the video game
---
I'm gonna take it pretty relaxed and play my usual times.    I expect blizzard to be putting out massive fires and apologizing for how unprepared they were for it.
---
Definitely. There’s also nothing wrong with raiding as resto/holy to get better gear for off specs for fun. It’s probably the easiest way to get good gear for the off specs instead of trying to make it as a feral/prot/ret/shadow/moon kin main.
---
NS is worth it still, I am talking about the talent that reduces mana cost on healing touch.  
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxGMoZVecocs
---
It's not about ignoring them, they are just used for other things.
---
You are "so fucking done" because your argument is shit.
---
I was messing around on a warrior on a pserver. I was sad whenever I saw other people, because I couldn't do anything for them =(. Definitely wasn't quite as sad when someone gave me BoM though!
---
He is. He said on stream when playing with Xaryu in RFD
---
Lok‘tar Ogar!
---
The VOD for the full run starts here [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/450548358](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/450548358). I haven't watched Joana's most recent run, but I would assume a lot of the time difference comes down to small mechanical improvements. Like other people have said, Joana is the first to admit his mechanics are a bit rusty. It'd be interesting to watch the two runs side by side and make a list of the pathing differences.
---
This sounds like a thing that happened on Ed Edd and Eddy.
---
This is the one, Ret has many deficiencies that engi really covers for well like a ranged stun (grenade), ranged damage (dynamite), shadow/frost/fire reflectors, the Net is great considering you have BoF in case it goes wrong, Death Ray + bubble a thing?  Lots of cool possibilities
---
Even if the shaman does a good job healing, which will be tough because they really only become great healers in naxx gear, he's getting resto gear. Elemental shamans are tough to gear until aq40.
---
I could only fit 5 classes here, but you could add others at https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US
---
Yeah, but now are we going to go ahead and add items to make every non-viable class viable?
---
Or ya know boomkins look kinda like HUGE Owls, OWLS HOOT.....
---
He uses an addon called Leatrix Plus, link here [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic)
---
I would go Engineering + BS.
---
BS gives a use trinket with fear immunity, engineering is ofc amazing.
---
Probably a good idea to start with mining though and drop it when you have a lot of mats.
---
I honestly didn't know people did this for tips back when I started in TBC. I thought they just did it for fun I guess. So one day I roll into Org with my belf paladin. For once there's no one on the mailbox so I hop on and start dancing ...
---
boom, trade window, 10g. Wait what?
---
Bingo, when you don't have group finder, and you invest the time into just getting into the dungeon itself, you are better off working with people who might not know the place than having to leave and start all over again.
---
I hated using group finder when I got into Lich King, every dungeon I got into was basically the first time I had ran it, so I didn't fall into the robot shuffle and was not sure how to even navigate certain parts and would just get kicked if I asked anything.
---
Most off-tanks back in the day were fury/arms warriors who had defensive sets. They were expected to off-tank as needed, yes, but when they weren't needed they simply switched back to their DPS sets and often topped damage by a considerable margin. 
---
Every raid tended to have a single priest as shadow in order to considerably buff warlock damage, but that single priest was often the raid leader, or reached their position as designated shadow priest by healing for the guild and providing crafting services or consumables, they made themselves valuable enough and liked enough that they could assume that position.
---
Most priests and warriors when it came to raiding signed up with the full expectation of having to off-tank or heal whenever they were needed. There was no elite attitude among warriors that made them think "I top DPS all the time I shouldn't have to off-tank". They simply got into their protection gear and they off-tanked as needed.
---
It's was the same for many hybrid players, they signed up to raids as moonkin or feral or retri or shadow, they put on their healing gear, and they got on with their job. They geared up for their primary raiding role - healing - and as the caster DPS or rogues collected gear they began to collect the items that were no longer needed for their off-specs. A trickle down loot system.
---
It's how the game worked, everyone understood and accepted their roles. They waited patiently for their gear, or they PvP'd for gear, so they could play around with their primary specs in dungeons or battlegrounds.
---
This is seriously a think, comiclly I remember a raid where we had 2 lvl 58 Druids and a lvl 59 Warlock, Summoning Portals / SoulStones and Decursing is no joke lol
---
You can clear MC with 40 paladins of you really wanted. Average player skill in the raid will have a lot more effect than your class comp.
---
All very useful information! Thanks for the tips!
---
We should get a separate sub for streamer vids
---
Rouge ganking in stv
---
*uses grenades and all possible engineering gandgets*
---
Everyone: Oh cool
---
*uses one pot*
---
Everyone: HOW DARE YOU LOSER, WHO EVEN USES POTS IN A DUEL LMAO GTFO
---
I agree. 400 is way too big of a window, either slash it to 100 or do away with it
---
&gt; Because Vile Poisons is garbage. Improved Poisons is better, even though you shouldn't take it either. A 3.33% increase in off-hand damage per talent point is better than all your other options.
---
Including Murder. Even in BWL, with all its dragon bosses.
---
Yes it is. So you're starting to comprehend but still not fully grasping it. 
---
Any idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc is a unit of culture (meme). Internet memes are just a subset of that, they are ideas and patterns of behaviour.
---
LH Helm is also a bit of a special case because that hit is really hard to get for a tank and 2 hit on one piece really opens up your options for gear.
---
The living breathing world. World PVP. And so much more :D
---
Why use grenades and engineering gadgets but no pots?
---
Yeah, no doubt. There's still gonna be a little more farming required, because of respecs, but it's probably the lesser of two evils if you want to raid, but also play a less desirable spec.
---
I know how progressive tax rates work. I guess the Bernouts in here just can't take a joke.
---
Pretty sure my orc warrior was level 50 the first time i killed a 60 alliance rogue who tried to gank me. Sure i used retalation and he kept hitting me like a dumbass but still, the feeling coming out on top from something like that was...godlike.
---
That's what I did for MoP and WoD. It's what I will most likely do for Classic. Even with layering I expect starting zones to be packed and for me not being able to do anything isn't all that fun. I dunno. I might try to log in and do a flight path run or something instead for funsies.
---
I know it's a fun novelty for some people, but it's something I've experienced with several expansions already so it's not this "one of a kind" experience to me. I can pass if I don't find launch playable and won't regret it.
---
I tell myself that I wouldn´t have finished studying Computer Science, if it wasn´t for my passion in well crafted experiences like the earlier iterations of WoW.
---
lolol
---
That doesn't really seem like an accurate indicator. Every other source I've seen says that warriors will be the most popular class by far D:
---
Well I'm rolling Orc ofc as an OffTank.
---
But I still do subscribe to Troll MT. Because 10-40% haste is awesome and when they get Thunderfury as the guild MT they don't need the ACLG crutch either.
---
Personally I don’t think that will be the case. Not with all these stress tests and the experience they have from so many expansions.
---
[Thank fucking god](https://imgur.com/voWtVnH).
---
Layering is continent/server wide. If a layer has 3k players on it, they'll all be split up among the starting zones because everybody starts at level 1. They will still be packed. Individual zones are not layered separately as far as I understand.
---
I'm more of a Thunder Bluff man myself - but given the choices available, no doubt - Orgrimmar any day. Ironforge looks like some communist housing project, completely soulless. In Orgrimmar you have legends like Saurfang, Thrall, Vol'jin Gamon and Auctioneer Wabang. Meanwhile the only famous Ironforge resident is that retard who walks around selling bread.
---
Right lol who made these "rules"
---
No, I just realize that to continue discussing this with you is pointless and I'd rather put my dick in an electric pencil sharpener than continue with you.
---
You have won, I now have a sharpened penis.
---
Well, there is something to be said for experience the insanity of the launch and the hype. It might wear of quickly, but I'd log for that at least even if going away for the rest of the week. The second week will probably be a much better experience if you just want to play.
---
Is this the same guy from sc2 beta lmao
---
lol me too. I never minded launch problems all that much and expect them with Classic. I wouldn't be surprised if, like a lot of expansion launches, it's still unplayable for most of us lol
---
It's why we have layering.
---
I also enjoyed the adventures of a dwarf called Cru :\^)
---
Im guilty as this as anyone else. But why dont we just leave politics out of wow. Im no better for being some pissed off leftist and engaging with you. Its classic wow lets just kill bears and genocide murloks
---
Because people on this subreddit havent raided in 15 years if at all so they refuse to believe that hunters should be the one nightfalling if youre really trying
---
It's not *that logic*.
---
We just happen to be talking about levels 12-17. Which happen to be Westfall vs Darkshore. If you skip any other chapter then you will get locked some quest chains and you will have trouble following the rest of the guide.
---
I never claimed that this is ultimate leveling guide. This is leveling guide based on a Speedrun that can literally watch on Youtube.
---
The Speedrun links are on every page of the guide.
---
If you can't trust a guide that you can watch, you're free to skip on this one.
---
I’m audibly laughing at work this sub is gonna get me fired
---
You're assuming Blizzard only creates new Layers when one is completely full to the server cap. This is false and we've seen it over and over again in the Stress Tests and Beta. Blizzard will be aggressively Layering upon launch. There could be 100+ Layers on a single realm. Your starting zone might not even have 50 people in it.
---
you "Of course there are other items with +hit on them, but that doesn't stop Bloodvine Vest from being BIS for Shadow Priests until the end of AQ40."  
---
me "he was talking about going tailoring for using a bloodvine set. which is not needed for a priest.
---
garb drops anywhere in AQ so you can get it at the start ;)
---
"
---
so the moment you mentioned a specific piece and not the set i cleared it up. then you had an emotional meltdown about it.  its clearly that time of the month for you.  run along now little girl. you are getting annoying
---
If it was an appropriate item for their class and I believed they were going to equip it, I would not consider need rolling a BoE to be ninjaing.
---
13th of august!
---
&gt; For the Alliance!
---
Nobody says that.
---
That's what's funny about personal experiences. My anecdotal experience with private servers contradict yours. Who's to say who's is more accurate? 
---
My money is on the community being no different than r/classicwow, /r/wow, the official forums, and retail. I feel like these are the closest representations to the general population we experience in game and will continue to experience in classic. You will have a bunch of raging, entitled assholes on one side, a bunch of noobs getting flamed by the aforementioned assholes, a few kind, well-natured players that genuinely want to spread information, support, and good vibes on the other side. The nice folks will insist that this the community they've been talking about all along while the assholes will..well, we know what assholes do. 
---
I'm hard pressed to be convinced that this fabled community is just gonna come back when every thing I see and hear tells me that those times are long gone and are never coming back.
---
I've always preferred their name during TBC:
---
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in a Chicken Suit.
---
Until they release WoW Classic: Classic in 15 years, at least.
---
You'll need to aggregate data from several search terms for each class if you want any kind of an accurate depiction of what people are searching for.
---
Idk what this even means. Druid leveling is fast as fuck once you get cat form.
---
He's 34. He acts pretty immature for his age, but he does indeed look like he's in his mid 30s to me.
---
&gt; No because the servers will make sure equal numbers of players are distributed between a, b or c. 
---
How will they ensure that if you and your friends get to choose? It can't be *both* self-balancing *and* players get to permanently choose a layer before the layers are merged.
---
The whole reason people proposed choosing a layer is so you could always see your friends. That's already the reason servers with names exist. The problem is that sometimes you can't access a server, because there are too many people on it.
---
Layering is the solution to that problem. Your solution to the problem you have with layering is.. to make layering like servers. So you're reintroducing the problem layering exists to solve. Now you sometimes won't be able to login, because you've picked a layer, and that layer is too crowded.
---
Nevermind the fact that "picking a layer" ignores what a layer is. The entire point is that it's dynamic. Layers don't exist, if the server is under a certain population. Layers only span a single continent, not the entire world. The same server could have Kalimdor have 3 layers, and EK have 1.
---
Yup - I find that to be the most brutal, lots of traveling between zones to do quests, trying to run instances to power through, but having a group fall apart, etc... 
---
Once I got to 50, the end was in sight, I felt powerful, and I started getting gear that I would use for quite a while from both quests and dungeons, also BRD is just the best.
---
Yes really.
---
Yeah this guy is a fucking dumbass. Ive played like this since WotLK. Dont listen to his nonsense, we both know whats up.
---
(get a book though, and put it with a mouse pad on the right arm of the chair. makes a big difference IMO)
---
probably one of the 2 swords needed to combine and make Sul'Thraze.
---
​Hijacking a sticky comment to make sure people see this.
---
Haha that’s what I feel like. When I was like 14 I remember running around stormwind for like an hour or two doing absolutely nothing and now I feel like I’m always gonna be doing something.
---
Make the druid for pvp and level another toon for pve!
---
I've been a lifelong Alliance/Normal server player but recently decided to go Horde/PVP server for Classic.  This post makes me STOKED to play world pvp!  I can't believe what fun I've missed out on.  I'm sure it's frustrating af sometimes, but stories like this never happened on Normal realms.  Good times are ahead!  :D
---
It’s easier to get banging loot that wouldn’t otherwise be available. Most of the core classes are using their tier sets so getting the non-tier/non bis loot often went to people for off specs. I might have been healing to get the pvp shadowpriest loot but I still got it and probably (definitely) wouldn’t have gotten it if I was trying to raid shadow.
---
Agree. Had so many trouble on my laptop which have windows 10, but they will end support for windows 7 in a few months so we have to downgrade at some point.
---
There is a difference between being a jerk or just not going out of your way to be nice though. You don't have to act nice, but there is no need to act like a prick either.
---
Well, Tauren can do-away with ACLG too. It's allll about that dank Thunderfury
---
Almost like people have been doing this on private servers for awhile.
---
Best meme ever
---
Yea perhaps. I suppose when I am playing I hunt for chill guilds and then mostly just hang out with them.  That may skew my community bias.
---
Same, Told the wife I was taking the 2nd friday after launch day off to sit and do nothing but WoW. She looked at me and said, "You're such a nerd" I smiled and said "Duh".
---
Rank 7/8 isn't even that bad, there is a bump in the road there, however, where you aren't ranking up every week/every other week. Rank 10 to 11 was absolutely brutal, and I could never quite get there between school, work and PvE commitments.
---
Yes this or the "you dont have time to put down totems in pvp" is quite revealing. Either a troll or a player that you never ever ever want in your bg group:)
---
No, not really. Each layer will essentially simulate one fully populated server, or relatively close to it. So starting zones won’t be entirely different than a server with layers.
---
Layering primarily exists to prevent server mergers and other negative side effects of player attrition. Starting zones MAY be a little more bearable, but it’s not the primary reason layering exists.
---
So are you suggesting that they are going to intentionally release less servers than what is necessary and refuse to create new servers if needed?
---
What do u mean hardly anyone will be there? It's basically as populated as the barrens, fucking EVERYONE apart from super hardcore speedrunners goes there.
---
The truth hurts (feels good?)
---
Yes..90's kids would watch this growing up all the time.
---
I mean mouse scroll is used for camera distance which you never need to move on the fly and can just rebind those to page up and page down. Tilde, side button, and shift enter are not.
---
The same logic applies to people rebinding C, Q,E.
---
Absolutely, the skill floor and skill ceiling like I said are very high. Much more effective for someone who hasn't played classic before, stick with healing. Healers are still able to solo, still incredibly powerful in pvp, and in raids serve a vital role.
---
In the case of druids being feral, there's a lot of work that goes on outside of the raid to even have a chance of competing with other DPS who can just coast through.
---
So absolutely, if people want to play an off-meta spec, they can have fun with that. But they shouldn't expect the outlier results that youtubers/streamers get, as there is a lot of knowledge and experience to get those results. (Much harder than in more modern expansions where things are much easier)
---
Ok
---
Wrote and ran the first "proper" non donor classic server scriptcraft about 8 years ago
---
Ugg I would rather remove my dick with a cheese grater than have to listen to any more of your blabbering.
---
Contratulations! 
---
I now have no penis, and now my biggest worry is I am going to have to put up with you hovering over me telling me how to change my key bindings; you know, so I can have more fun with this game.
---
You may be interested in the Classic PvP Summit, Stormx provided alot of info regarding druid gear there. It's probably also available on the Classic PvP Discord
---
My whole server is gonna think I’m a girl until I talk I’m ventrilo
---
Yeah, that's a nice example that if you communicate and do what your group needs, they're typically accommodating of what you're trying to get done, too. If not, time to move along.
---
yea, althought the high stamina values on pvp gear go a long way in my opinion
---
Removal of LFR, raids have to mean something. LFD is fine-ish but if it went as well that would be fine.  
---
I do like flying mounts but I guess a solution would be to disable them in new content until you level up and do a quest of some sort.  
---
Less dailies and moving to weeklies sounds good to me.
---
Exactly, yes. Very well worded
---
Love that guy. He uses to play HOTS and was a coach at one point. Great dude
---
No matter what utility, min maxing, or any other justification you can bring to hybrid classes their tier sets all have pure healing stats. The hybrid dps gear is hard to get and not ideal at all. 
---
Good post, new players should definitely know this
---
Hunter PVP damage is great.  Badge of the swarmguard can be a great trinket to use along with probably an engi trinket or PVP trinket in 2nd slot.  
---
PVP is more about control and burst with a hunter, and the auto-aimed-auto-multi combo will do about 3k+ with any crits on cloth or leather and that's only in AQ40 gear.  Your damage is fine, but the weakness is being CC'd or effectively nullified by having someone on you constantly.
---
Thank you so much
---
Got it so you just downvoted and don’t have an answer or any actually good points. Won’t be using it.
---
&gt; Each layer will essentially simulate one fully populated server, or relatively close to it.
---
&gt; So starting zones won’t be entirely different than a server with[out] layers.
---
Yes they will.
---
&gt; Layering primarily exists to prevent server mergers and other negative side effects of player attrition. Starting zones MAY be a little more bearable, but it’s not the primary reason layering exists.
---
This is a side effect of allowing more players in each starting zone. It is desired, yes, but it is reached by preventing overcrowding in the starting zones, thus the primary objective of Layering is to prevent overcrowding in the starting zones.
---
A lot of things are possible if you have the hours.
---
oh i know, i was being sarcastic :D
---
I think the solution should be exactly what it is now with no changes what so ever.  If you make a niche solution viable then you'd have to do it for the rest of the classes. 
---
No changes.
---
The reality for my hunter on the last 2 servers has been that all the Melee I've done it with by that point (went for it late in my pre-raid gearing even if DM wasn't out just because bigger upgrades elsewhere) were just chasing Ironfoe and already had their HoJ, so I didn't have to really compete for it. I'm wondering how similar that will be on Classic though.
---
Yeah I definitely agree though and you're really entitled to roll on anything that is a mainspec upgrade either way, no matter how it compares for other people in your group. I'm just saying why I personally wouldn't, unless the melee were dickheads
---
I don’t think pserver players think no one else can compare to third party knowledge.
---
I think the point is just not to dismiss it completely. There are certainly errors in pserver numbers, but there’s also a lot they got *right* and to dismiss it all with the wave of a hand would be to a dismiss a potentially valuable benchmark.
---
Shaman totems, Talent trees.
---
I mean other things like macros, push to talk buttons, plugins, etc.
---
😂
---
My bad, I didn’t realize that you were just a fucking idiot.
---
Get out of here with that “no” garbage, you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
Interesting that advice and minuscule conversations are considered treacherous hovering in your mind.  It's starting to make sense.
---
Stay away from da voodoo!
---
The majority of people use quest helper addons when they're actually leveling anyways.
---
Honestly i was there for this kind of stuff, its the funnest. Raiding will always be there but i remember the world pvp much more than the raiding
---
Many people can afford to, and do, respec multiple times per week. Others can barely afford to respec once per month. It depends on how well you are able to generate gold. Professions help play a key part in this.  
---
Can you clarify your second question, I'm not sure what your asking exactly, I'm not sure how the quality of PvP affects whether you can have an alt for pvp and a tank/healing main or not?
---
To answer your title, Yes it is. Also you don't necessarily have to respec either.
---
Crossroads are day 1.
---
You can carry the flag.
---
its worth it to play both to see the different quests.  but man, in vanilla alliance had it way easier with their leveling zones being close together.  horde had to go all over the damn place.
---
and alliance could run deadmines for so long to level.  horde couldnt get it on pvp servers at all. youd spend hours corpse hopping to get in. not worth it.
---
100g isn't that much. It's a few hours of farming or $7.99 from China.
---
Nice
---
But my class doesn't have a weapon quest between 30 and 40. :(
---
I don't know why people hate on old Org so much. Can't wait to be home
---
Same, I enjoy the 34-40 range cus I get to run SM a bunch. It's that post 40 high (that 31ptn talent) that kills me
---
Okay kid. Better luck next time.
---
Unreal engine doesn't look that great.
---
He even says in his guides that he relies on friends to give him money for a mount. It is all about getting to 60 as fast as possible with no regard for anything else. No one planning on being able to afford mount at 40 should be following his guide to the letter.
---
I will naturally since i work a lot of hours. But i want to be there near release.
---
Thanks good to know
---
Afaik that wasn't Nhym. That was Cranium and Summergale.
---
So you're gonna buy that every week. Just casually add $32 to your monthly sub?
---
Possible, but very expensive.
---
Sure you can. Oh... did you not read the post?
---
Please even attempt to explain how the number of players in a starting zone has anything to do with player attrition and server merges.
---
Go ahead, I’ll wait. Kid.
---
As an MT that didnt get thunderfury after doing MC every week for a year, I caution that mentality. The way I see it, if you get TF, your race doesnt really matter ( besides troll ). Sure maybe 5% hp is better with TF. But if you dont get TF, orc is by far best until you get THC and by that point you already beat the game.
---
Well, I want to play a shaman so the decision is made for me.
---
Please, now that I identify as a woman, thanks to you, I would request that you treat me as an equal.
---
It's from The Princess Bride.
---
For most professions you have to be a certain character level in order to gain more ranks in your profession. While having two gathering professions on your main is a smart way to make gold (and you can always drop one of the gatherings for a crafting at 60 if you want), your lvl 5 bank alt will not be able to craft any relevant recipes. 
---
The only exception is that a lvl 5 character with enchanting can disenchant any item in the game regardless of level. Hope that makes sense! It will really be up to you. I think that crafting is a noble endeavor and it is a great way to make friends and be really helpful to a guild in certain situations.
---
I spend at least 30-45 min a day on talent calculator sites trying to make bizzare but somewhat functional builds
---
Blizz spends hundreds of man hours creating those raids, they don't want only 1% of the playerbase to actually be able to complete it.
---
This was basically me in 2005. Sub for 2 months and only play for 2 weeks then get distracted and never pick it up again.
---
Some of you guys need actual reality checks, the rest of you need a mental institution.
---
Let me point out, again, that classic wow is for a NICHE audience.
---
TO illustrate this point, refer to the subscriber numbers on reddit (redditors themselves being more likely to fit into a niche audience) of THIS sub (a scant 150k) and the overall WoW sub.
---
What you're really saying is 
---
&gt;"I /u/TheRealRecollector want retail to suffer as I switch to Classic, and i sure hope that 40-50% of the retail players do also! OH MAN THAT WOULD SHOW THEM MY OPINIONS ARE THE MOST RIGHT"
---
And thats just really sad, like, on a personal level, nobody should envy someone with that sad of a life.
---
Go get some therapy man, you can be valuable without projecting that your opinions are "the most true"
---
I intend to buy a lot more gold than that.
---
And with modern wow you were motivated to finish your study because you want to fix what was broken.
---
As an equal I recommend you bind your keys like this so you're not reaching for abilities.  Let me know if you have any questions.
---
Wait... Sorry.  I just accosted you.
---
I myself am a feral druid, I will be healing for the majority of raids, there will be some times where I will be offtaning, or potentially DPSing, but the majority of the time healing. 
---
Healing can seem like a chore (though wak-a-mole is fun as hell), trying to play a druid as a DPS.... my hands start hurting thinking back to the classic days of dpsing as a feral druid. (It's really hard to compete due to how the class is designed)
---
In the case of Paladin tanks, the lack of a taunt is pretty much going to be a death sentence in quite a few encounters where a tank swap is required.
---
People should enjoy the class they play, and they should research the mechanics in depth, and ensure that what their goals are, line up with the class they pick.
---
Lion's Pride Inn, Moonguard.
---
If you're playing on a PvP server, you're going to fall behind and increase your chances of getting ganked later on.
---
Bs for nightfall, since it's the only reason someone will bring a ret to the raid
---
It's the endgame he is worried about. As DPS you need MCP's to DPS properly, and healing doesn't seem like they want to.
---
No your actually ignoring the quesion because you don't have an answer. And its fun to watch the squirming from this end :D
---
Why would someone sinsister strike with daggers, they backstab.
---
I'd really like to do the warlock Dreadsteed quest again. There's one part that is done in Dire Maul (I think there were two parts there actually) and I had a blast soloing it back then. It made me feel that all classes should have similar quests, where you have to make good use of your key abilities.
---
A lot of people are saying "No" but I would argue that Westfall chat gets pretty damn crazy. Not as crazy as Barrens Chat, I'm sure, but every time I go there on pservers it is pretty nuts. Same in retail, honestly. Most Alliance players prefer to quest there over Loch Modan or Darkshore due to Deadmines and the location is just better for interacting with the rest of the faction.
---
YOU GIVE ME MANA YOU DONT GET BUFF PI IS FOR MAGES
---
You should probably play something that you enjoy.
---
hope you get banned
---
True, you can get very unlucky. At the end of the day, If you put it the most effort, consumables, and are good at tanking mechanically you'll shine above any other race.
---
*cough* Orc master race *cough*
---
Wait actually? Lol
---
More players that choose a server because the starting zones aren't crowded equals more players that continue playing on a server throughout the lifecycle of the game. It's obvious kid.
---
haha I shared a laugh
---
TAB 1 noob /s
---
Desolace, Arathi, STV, and Dustwallow Marsh are in that range. It isn't that bad.
---
How does this compare to sharpening stones? Does the same apply to warriors?
---
&gt;People talk about having alts for pvp - is pvp gear really that good to where you can have an alt for pvp and tank/heal on your main?
---
I'll have an "alt" for pvp - at 19 and 39 - you can do both on your tank - either way you are putting hours into pvp for pvp gear... won't matter if you are spending those hours on your main or alt 
---
There is no "My rogue can rank faster than my paladin"
---
Yeah you’re obviously trolling, I’m done.
---
Buying gold isn't against the EULA, only selling it is.
---
World PvP can have some really odd consequences. 
---
I was part of an RP community pre-launch, and some of us wanted a RP-PvP experience. So since Blizzard wasn't releasing them at game launch, we chose a PvP server and we all rolled there to form our own "Unofficial RP-PvP server." Things went pretty well at first. The server was very populated and we were a big minority, but we had enough folks to have some cool events. And we would even coordinate with the Horde guilds that rolled there with us (I was Alliance). 
---
Then one day we encountered one of said Horde guilds in STV. At first emotes were exchanged, and then of course some violence. I thought it was great, we were on either side of a rope-bridge duking out. This went on for a while, before finally one of them found our Vent server and started complaining, "What the fuck are you guys doing, why are you attacking us?" Which was... odd to me. We all explicitly avoided RP servers, despite being roleplayers, because we wanted a PvP server experience. Yet this guy was offended that we were taking part in that with them? I pretty much said "Fine, we'll leave I guess." Yet they continued to be salty about it, and myself and others refused to apologize in taking part in a natural part of the game.
---
Through my time playing WoW fighting Horde that I know was part of the fun, and I never took it hard if I lost and got camped. Yet over this one little skirmish the Horde and Alliance sides of our RP community pretty much grew more and more distant until both communities basically disappeared, and then the individual players relocated to RP-PvP servers when those came out. The rest either gave up RP, or rolled to an RP server after realizing PvP servers were not actually for them.
---
Ah yes the child groomer. Ha ha how funny we meme this criminal. /s
---
Not just strange but also annoying. I loved my priest too bits. But it's a bit of a disappointment now.
---
Mage, dk, paladin all very boring now.
---
And you ruined your chance of having me like this game and becoming your own personal pocket healer.  Good night, enjoy your game while I go watch Netflix.  Oh and by the way, you suck in bed and I'm cheating on you!
---
Bubble hs out of every dangerous situation. 3 parrys in a row, bubble hs out, didnt get skill up crafting 3 yellow items bubble hs out, Raid leader is freaking out bubble hs out.
---
hurts good\*
---
If you’re a hunter and you roll for HoJ over a warrior or rogue - you may not technically be a ninja looter - but you’ll most likely be treated as such.  Word of that kind of thing gets around quick. 
---
I’m not saying it’s right - but don’t be surprised if it happens
---
Sharpening stones are inferior to poisons which are inferior to shadow oil, so while I haven't done the math for Warriors, I would expect them to be using shadow oil too.
---
Hassle?
---
If you enjoy the class... play it.
---
Getting T3 bis doesn't mean you beat the game... you can play druid and play how you want. 
---
If you get beat by a druid that farmed more items than you... they worked for the win. 
---
It's the same as every other class papa.
---
Isn't the gear from raiding better than pvp gear?
---
Here's NOPE doing this on a multi guild scale https://youtu.be/UPnMFJiOxT4
---
God I can't wait for vanilla
---
Really because neither the post title nor the video title say that.
---
From what we've seen you actually can't dps with it either.
---
Then i hope you get "hacked" by said chinese
---
If someone searches for "Paladin" it does not mean they are interested in playing a paladin.
---
The search could have been "why are paladins so boring to play in classic wow"
---
You're a champ!
---
Seems reasonable
---
Don't judge a community based on YouTube comments. Those are always garbage
---
How do you make a game expansive without abandoning old areas? I never played BC, but in WotLK there was a mass exodus to Dalaran. All the old zones were dead, people stayed in Dalaran because it was central to all the current content. I imagine it was the same with Shatt. 
---
MoP everyone sat in shrine because it was central to all content.
---
WoD everyone sat in garrisons because it was central to all content.
---
Legion everyone sat in New Dalaran because it was central to all content.
---
Every expansion or area they add just takes people out of the old world until you get the point where you're genuinely surprised to see someone else in the world.
---
Yup, rank 13 and 14 gear is great! Just not better than naxx gear.
---
Rank 10 is great for a lot of classes but raiding zg and aq will be better.
---
still in the post, shall send a DM when it arrives
---
Makes me feel so much better!
---
Almost definitely not. Not only will you be taking gear away from DPS thereby lowering the raids potential DPS output, but it will also not increase the healing output.
---
It's all preference. If you have long fingers it's fine to Q/E strafe and use A/D for ability binds instead. I've always found this easier personally, and never noticed any disadvantage in pve or pvp. The real pro tip is to unbind S^/s
---
What would a hunter have a WW axe?
---
also how in the FUCK is it balanced to give that to one faction but not the other? this is the kind of shit I would hear about in 2005 or 2006 and would make me think "Blizzard clearly hates horde and loves ally" which was a very common sentiment my friends, guildmates, most hordies, and I all shared.
---
Pvp more stam heavy
---
Yeah, because getting "hacked" is still a thing with the Authenticator...
---
We should get different subs for complains about streamers, it got old fast. Its wow classic content for a wow classic content sub.
---
45-55 is the worst imo for sure.
---
Because the item dropped. Its not 1000g its whatever you get for it vs them using the physical object. Maybe there are none of those on the ah. I stand by my statement. If an item drops and someone can use it as an upgrade. That need is more than someone else needs money. It's really not a hard concept.
---
Sorry if this was posted already. I got super excited though!
---
Your terminology is confusing. To fuck with someone means something different than having heard of him, at least where I'm from.
---
Man I think things are going to change from patch to patch, play your shammy. I’m sure he’ll be viable more or less regardless!
---
Dwarf Warrior @ 60, as I just hit rank 10. Must add that different race-mounts are good fun. (Dwarves tbh. have only one way to go: Mechanostriders, but I already did that on my other 60).
---

---
**Warning:** if you go with this Dwarf-moustache during Classic, wearing your rank 10 helmet will make you look hideous, removing your moustache. This was only fixed (I believe) after WoTLK, but as I had quit back then, I can't say for sure, could be longer.
---
Is HoJ good on hunter? The proc only works on melee attacks according to classicdb, so i feel like im missing something here.
---
Its like litteraly written on the miniature image from the vidéo...
---
It is worth it, druids are easy to level. If you just plan on only raiding and fling nothing else, expect to have to heal most of the time. But if you get cool with a group of people, you will find no problem being a dedicated tank or Derek dps. I’m personally going Druid myself, a class I havnt played much of so personally it’s worth it to me.
---
They're basically "chores" you feel compelled to do before you get to play the actual game. They were the reason I quit MoP a week after hitting max level.
---
&gt; My friend had his account compromised with an authenticator after purchasing wow gold.
---
Then your friend is an idiot. Giving a single character name to the gold sellers should not result in any threat to your account.
---
In any case, I won't be buying the gold from my "main" account.
---
Yes that is the prevalling design mentality and I was not advocating improvements over no improvement. Simply stating it would be a better path than removal, the original point.
---
1-No changes
---
2-Improvements
---
3-Removal
---
There is no pricetag on right and wrong. There is no amount of money that would have me take something someone will use for me to instead sell it.
---
That's fine and all, but this guys comment is just saying swords do more damage than daggers with ss so it's worse dmg. Not even talking talents.
---
I am bummed that I am missing the launch and won't be back home from the family vacation until the 30th.
---
I haven't told my wife yet that I have taken the following week off work to just to play WoW.
---
shot your information to a EU guild. Guys name is Howaito
---
Would they still be if you are stacking all those spell power consums? I realize the standard set of consums are expected, but I've raided with WR setting guilds and even they didn't require spell power consums for warriors and rogues. You also run into the problem of buff limits when you start to add all these double sets of consums
---
I did 40-50 a couple of times on horde before raventusk village and thorium point were added. Those levels were pretty brutal without those quest hubs.
---
It makes exactly 5% of a difference
---
That BoE epic can be sold by whoever wins it an use it on upgrades on the AH. It can have just as much value for someone who can't equip it.
---
There’s no way in hell there’s going to be 500-1000+ level 1’s zoning in to each layer day 1. That would defeat the purpose of layering altogether. They will be aggressively layering the fuck out of starting zones minute one, but that’s not to say they won’t still be crowded.
---
People farming gold are the suckers. Even a low class minimum wage worker is better off buying it.
---
There will be a ton of 2h weapons available that nobody will use for PvE, as they are not BiS. If you are ranking, any reasonable guild will help you out with a nice 2H.
---
If you're serious about MT and PvP in vanilla than you're a 25+ hour a week player, and levelling time is fairly trivial compared to your total playtime over 2 years. So yes levelling an alt to pvp/go along to split alt runs to pickup dps gear seems pretty logical.
---
You are missing the point though.
---
All tanks and only plate dps available to one of the factions.
---
I don't know many streamers that act mature on camera. It's probably just not a profitable way to present yourself.
---
Assuming you can run ZG, you don't need more than a piece or two of bloodvine, if any at all. 3% from the rings, 1% from cloak or offhand, 1% from gloves, plus the hit you can get on neck and belt from elsewhere. If you don't have Anathema you can grab the staff with 2%. Yeah there will be competition with other casters but you get loot out of ZG four times as fast as the larger raids.
---
Just clarify the loot rules at the beginning of every dungeon.
---
The fact that it's literally more efficient to hit westfall do your fly around quest, then tram to IF, run through through loch modan etc to wetlands, boat to darkshore, and then start questing to hit 16-17 and still come out ahead speaks for itself. 
---
Quests are laid out nicely, many routes where you knock out 4-5 quests very quickly. very few bottlenecks like the pocketwatch quest in an overpopulated zone. etc. 
---
I don't hate westfall, I've done it on a few character but it's simply much much slower. 
---
If people like it and want to do it, more power to them, I'm simply explaining why you spend time in darkshore instead.
---
Goodness gracious I loved that show. I read everything in their voices. Especially Rolf. Great comic, really well done!
---
If the guy was entering from Burning Steppes then yes it would have been a much shorter run.  But like in another response I put somewhere the guy entered from the south (Searing Gorge) and it's a considerably longer run.
---
Also, at least in my experience, not even the most coordinated groups could willingly zone out into an enemy and win unless it was 2:1 or 3:1 in favor of the rescue team:
---
* Many people's characters would load into the open world before their loading screen would end.  This made you a literal free target for a few seconds.  That's all the other raid needed to snowball a fight out of control.
---
* People's computers would then have to load 80+ name plates and models. Most people's computers would freeze which, then again, would make you a free target, in favor of the non-rescue raid.
---
I've definitely seen rescue teams work, but when its a guild waiting at the instance entrance vs a guild zoning out, I'll take the guild waiting at the entrance any day.
---
You mean video.google.com  youtube is younger then vanilla is
---
https://i.imgur.com/KCqFRmB.png
---
That tickles!
---
Oh, I didn't even realize the comment was that dumb, I just looked at the talents linked lol. Dagger's dont do less DPS even, many are higher, they do less damage he means too.
---
Which is why I only mentioned the vest.
---
In fact, when something looks realistic (or tries to) every minor flaw becomes very annoying and stands out. The cartoonish appearance of WoW is exactly why it works so well.
---
Yup just saw it 10/10
---
I wasn't really talking mechanics, more aesthetics, voice lies, lore, etc.  Yeah you can watch it on youtube after the fact but it's not really the same.
---
Jay maple um sandwiché!
---
There is also a great bow in aq40
---
Would’ve thought it would be Mage? Higher (on demand) CC capability, parity in burst. Though potentially squishier of course.
---
That is true, thank you for the input :)
---
You will do ok in 5mans but gearing is a MAJOR issue since +SP Plate just wasnt really a thing. Really thats the jist of it, Druids Dire Bear Form let them be great tanks without the same gear investment that Warriors needed. 
---
TLDR: Do you, if you want to tank, Id advise Warrior or Druid, Pally is stuck in Ret/Holy for Pvp or Holy for PVE (Ret generates a stupid amount of threat in PvE and has OOM problems).
---
\#itwasalreadyposted
---
You didnt attach a picture
---
This is exactly how I always felt about it.
---
Alchy and engi will be a guaranteed gold sink. I’m going skinning and mining during leveling. After I’ve stole some devilsaur skins I’m gonna ditch skinning and learn engi.
---
What is the best class for killing shamans?
---
Sucker.
---
I found 50-60 the easiest part. You get several new zones to go to and you can see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.
---
The rogues might have been really bad (probably were).  
---
But there were also other factors that could have been at play like low FPS and bad voice comms (lots of people didn't have mics back then).
---
I remember the Suppression Room murdered my FPS.
---
You're unlikely to hit the buff limit of 32. The one flask makes it worth it.
---
I wonder what streamers do for a living after they are done streaming. Would you actually put that on a resume? LOL
---
But a big beefy Tauren dual wielding Tfury and Maladath is sexy. A dagger tauren, not so much.
---
All about the gnome racial Escape Artist, screw the 5% int.
---
It will be attempted for sure lol
---
Yea warriors with no healer are definitely not the best in PvP, but in even a small group or with just a healer they are pretty fantastic. Also they scale with gear pretty immensely (same with rogues but even more-so for warriors) so you may struggle a bit in the beginning but as you get more geared you'll feel pretty significant increases in power.
---
Are you saying playing Ret Pally using Nightfall to buff spell damage isn't desirable? Ret is best for keeping the proc up.
---
this needs more upvotes
---
Great video!!!!!!!!
---
All great and valid points, but just as a pick one and go Id definitely say Hunter wins out IMO.
---
I'm going with mining and engineering. Might drop mining later for something else.
---
&gt; Why is an Arcane Crystal or Elementium Ingot no longer useful?
---
If they weren't useful they wouldn't still sell on the AH.
---
The most profound reward in the game is seeing the content. When you make it trivial to see all the content you make the game trivial.
---
Was Alliance Human Priest who rolled Horde BELF Pally in BC. As much as I love the Horde, a fond spot in my heart will always be there for I.F. Auction House and the High Lord Bolivar script going off in S.W Keep.
---
This is true.  
---
All expansions must accept items and gear from previous expansions, so it would need to be an entirely new game with a fresh inventory and features.  
---
A game like Classic WoW.
---
It's like studying history. Given historians have no primary source, they look for other information around that period, geographical location, or find sources from before and after the even they are studying. Then they create theories, ideas, inferences etc... All of that can then be shattered if a primary source is actually discovered with contrary evidence. 
---
This is what's happening. Lots of folks used clues, secondary data, and inferences to come up with their best attempt at the truth. But now the actual thing they are studying is being brought back and contradicting them. Even if that sucks, you have to give the primary source more value.
---
It's already been done. Onyxia went down.
---
Originally some undead faces would clip through masks like shadowcraft and bloodfang, I believe it was the jawless one with the tongue hanging down.  To fix this Blizzard simply made the masks stick out farther forward than they should so if you look a them from the side they have a weird profile.  I believe modern WoW still looks like this, and the hood looks a little weird from the side but overall the set still looks great.  A the time I was so annoyed I probably opened around a dozen tickets hoping I could annoy Blizzard into changing it until I gave up.
---
It's more the emphasis levels on applying melee DPS/CC I guess I'd say, if you go like 21/0/30 (melee BM in my original post, which I realize is a bit misleading) then you're putting a lot more emphasis on being in melee range and applying wing-clips and running through casts and shit like that. Calling it a drastic change may be overstating it but I'd say it feels different enough to warrant being called a different play-style.
---
Hi new person, I like your points and you're doing great!
---
^^Guys, ^^am ^^I ^^doing ^^this ^^right?
---
It only makes a difference if you are a min/maxer or join a guild that requires you to min/max. If you want to roll a human, roll a human.
---
Thanks
---
Hahahaha this is actually amazing
---
Yep, I'm sure gonna feel like a sucker having my epic mount the moment I hit 60, buying up every single Bottomless Bag the moment it hits the market, never having to farm for consumables, twinking out all my alts, and being able to respec whenever I want.
---
this is awesome !!! thank you !
---
No one said spending time with your family was a bad thing.  But having no time for just yourself is.
---
Why herb?
---
I just leave the arrow keys as turn left and right for that.
---
Doesn't intelligence boost damage for a mage?
---
It probably has diminished returns late game though.
---
How the hell does this low effort shit get so many upvotes
---
Haha i like the honousty
---
Nah dude, tier 2 helmet (stormrage) is BiS for all of classic for Org running, mailbox dancing and flexing. Has huge moose antlers
---
Thanks a bunch mate. Accepted his invitation to chat:)
---
Ahh, I can see where you're coming from with that one.
---
It's easier than 44-50 for sure - but the time it takes the standard player will be offputting to those not that experienced with vanilla.
---
If you have to ask no it's not worth it. Int is not a great stat in vanilla, it's a very minor boost, maybe 1% to dps under absolute best circumstances.
---
I think I might do the same.. maybe. Haha
---
&gt;  Some people take mostly tank BiS, but also take 2 or 3 healing items for longevity. Personally, I like really diversely statted gear, like the Genesis, Lizardhide, Feralheart, and PvP10 set.
---
This is really the correct answer.
---
Personally I play on the .... cluck... house... or something a play on those words (pserver), and I run rank 10 gear with 3 piece stormrage, healing mace, ony book offhand, and it works out well for me.
---
Again this is personal choice, and you need to figure out what situation you are in, and dictate your gear from there. If I am soloing, I can go more glass cannony, if I am flag carrier (as I described my set above), it needs to rely on more survival stats, along with able to have a good chunk of a mana pool.
---
I see where you're coming from, but the difference is I'm talking about something that happened 15 years ago and you're talking about your own events that happened recently.
---
In your experience, you're playing an ***old*** game on a ***modern*** server with a ***modern*** computer ***with high speed internet.***   You experienced a wildly different experience than Vanilla since your victory condition hinges on your computer's ability to render and load quickly.  That simply didn't happen for 95% of most guilds in Vanilla.
---
Many players' computers during Vanilla actually lagged just entering BRM.  Some people would literally take minutes to zone into MC and load everyone's names and mobs.  For many people, most raid fights completely lagged their computers and characters into the ground.
---
&gt; i know that most warriors will not tank and will try to get into dungeons as a dps.
---
Some warriors might try that. It's not gonna work out very well for them.
---
You can, it's just incredibly skill intense.
---
No disrespect, but I rarely recall seeing raids short on DPS roles, more often then not you’re stuck looking for Healers. That said, sometimes “Healer” really means “Debuff Duty” and Druids still fill that role quite well.
---
Work is da poop. No more...
---
They didnt have faction Balance in mind Back then. Otherwise Pala/sham wouldnt be faction-specific :D
---
It does.
---
Yea, a family of murderers and desecrators. Crawl back to the hell that spawned you or die here, Horde scum.
---
u/KrimsonWow n suicide watch. He will just blacklist all of us!
---
Something interesting about classic is most of the caster dps gear gives X +dmg/healing, where as healing gear gives +2x healing. I can see casters being mad if you as a healer take a shitty healing item which is a very good dps item for them. I can see a lot of people getting confused on caster loot come classic.
---
Yeah he was pretty good in early SC2, I remember him playing in the early MLGs during Wings.
---
Yes, I do think it will help with overpopulation. I also agree that it's not the primary design concern. If overpopulation was the only consideration, I'm sure sharding would be the way to go. From interviews, it seems the problem layering looks to tackle is what tourists and dropoff will do to the game. A side-affect of layering seems to be assisting in overpopulation. 
---
Also, you are contradicting yourself again. You don't want to take Blizzard at their word. You seem to argue that layering will stay later than claimed. That's fine. There's plenty of reason to feel that way, actually. Yet when it's convenient to your argument, you seem to go by what they say.
---
I'm willing to say Layering is Bad. It's just hard to have adult conversations about it if people think Blizzard is saying "Fuck you!" I'm simply of the belief that, of several bad options, this will likely be the least detrimental to the overall playerbase.
---
I understand if it's a bigger deal to you and some others. That's fine, and it sucks that the game isn't more to your tastes. However, the vitriol you exhibit is uncalled for.
---
But /u/BeholdTheHair is a cool bro.

&gt;doesn't elaborate

Also planning on being a mage and will miss Escape Artist a lot more than 5% int but meh...not being a gnome.
---
I don't think it's "stupid" per se, but it does lock each spec to a specific play style. It removes the idea of hybrid builds in favor of 3 strict play styles that may not overlap.  
---
Retail tells you how to play, what a to wear, and makes everything equal so that players are stripped of any opportunity to be creative or unique.

I agree it is a shitty world, and your post wasn't inaccurate. It's 100% easier to be female than male, and I say this as a hermaphrodite that has lived as both.

To be fair: I hate the reservation non-sense in 5-mans. But that’s OK because I don’t have to join your runs.
---
What sucks is that some servers devolved to a state where practically every run had multiple items reserved.
---
Back to topic: I don’t think anyone is entitled to any BoE unless they communicate it prior to it dropping.
---
Screw 5% int. The real benefit of rolling a gnome is the hidden racial where you get to watch someone seethe with rage after getting ganked by a pink haired smiling midget who then lets out the most annoying /lol sound in the game. But yeah, in answer to your question it's not a big deal at all.
---
Yeah, he probably supplied them with the email address he uses to log in or something. My point was that you just, with the undertones of a sarcastic prick, stated it wasn't possible to be hacked with an authenticator when in reality it is. That's all
---
This is gold
---
Oh, Gnome,  
---
You're simply the best, better than all the rest  
---
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met  
---
I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say  
---
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead
---
thanks, do you have any information on the professions that are limited by level?
---
They don’t get to decide what is and what isn’t a ninja. *We all* do.
---
It's just a regional thing.
---
"to fuck with" can mean both "make life a pain for" and "get along well with".
---
To hear someone use the "get along well with" one in context, watch recent interviews with Eminem. He uses the terminology a lot.
---
Does he have a guide portion to any of this, or do most runners follow a similar pattern but it's just execution making the difference?
---
Regarding BoP:
---
If you're worried about being perceived as a ninja, or you're worried that someone might ninja something important to you, its YOUR responsibility to let your group know up front what your intentions are as well as to ask what others are after.  I'm okay if a hunter rolls on Dal'Rends or if a rogue rolls for Blackcrow so long as they're clear about it in advance. Its up to you to determine if its worth the risk. Manage the group's expectations you'll minimize the risk of perceived ninja'ing. This goes for both PUG groups and guild or friend groups. 
---
Now, if a hunter says in the beginning that they don't want Dal'Rends and then rolls need on it. Yep, I'd call that a ninja. But just because a hunter rolls on Dal'Rends doesn't mean its a ninja.
---
Regarding BoE:
---
Still set expectations up in advance and make sure everyone agrees. For me, the default is always greed unless you actually need. But I understand the notion of needing everything and you can always pass it over to someone who will use it. 
---
If you're leveling, then honestly, who gives a shit. You shouldn't care. If Shadowfang drops and a rogue wants it, why shouldn't he be allowed to wear it? Not everyone will know that its an amazing lvl 19 twink item and they shouldn't be accused of being a ninja just because they didn't know any better.
---
Last but not least, relax. Its a game.
---
Stop poking me!
---
It’s nothing. There’s so many Gnomes Mages because escape artist is broken in pvp.
---
Alchemy will make and save a ton of gold. Mine will be LW.
---
Joana won't be even a top50 player to reach max level in classic
---
TL;DR Classic and Retail should not become like each other. They are two different styles of game that cater to mostly different sets of players and they should stay that way.
---
I like retail as it is. If you are paying attention it actually has a pretty neat story. Ya there are daily activities but at least for me the feeling of a need to do them isn't that strong. I don't mind taking a day off. The mechanics in the new raid are fun an interesting. I love that I can log on, find a group for an M+, finish it and log off all within an hour (that's right, fun, engaging, challenging content done inside an hour). And I can do all this without even being in a guild because of tools like the LFG tool.
---
When Classic releases, I'm going to be able to swap over to spending most of my time on Classic and still keep up with retail because retail doesn't really take that much time investment.  I'll log on and do an hour or two of story quests where I get to be part of the action and not just reading about it. I love that I can do that. And, I'll say it again, it's got a pretty neat story going on that has been has been hinted at since before legion, and definitely started building up during legion.
---
I just want them to keep retail going as it is, and then support classic with more classic style content. I don't really have a great idea of what that looks like other than avoiding cross-server things, dungeon finders, and other stuff like that. Something that keeps community important, keeps the effort level significant and doesn't invalidate previous efforts with easily accessible gear of higher levels.
---
Higher skill ceiling, but also higher skill floor.
---
Honestly a lot of the elitism activities in this Reddit come from players that played as children back in the day (I mean 12 or 13 and, myself included) and were treated unfairly due to their age. So now they see it as "pay back time" or whatever you want to call it. It's more anger they'd like to reflect on the general noob populous because they were treated that way.
---
It's a shame but, that's just the way it is.... Imagine the world changing to something beneficial to society because a few people say to do it. Not everyone will, however, thank you for your input in this Reddit for trying to calm down what bad that people are actually doing to each other here... After all, the game is a GAME. It is meant to be played, not worshiped, not obsessed over, not frequented so often that it ceases to be as such. I end my preaching here.
---
fix that cancer in the title
---
Druids are a blast to play. I can’t wait to level one.
---
These are amazing
---
Yeah he played sc2 briefly. I think he was ranked around top 10 in the early days, and he's taken games off the famous pros of that era like HuK and IdrA, but he left the scene pretty quickly. He actually has funny stories of getting hard flamed by IdrA in tournament lobbies after cheesing him.
---
You'd hit a wall at Magmadar because no tranq shot.
---
Not viable.
---
#9 is huge. Great post.
---
One spriest is nice if you have enough warlocks.  I find myself to be the minority when I think shadow weaving holy/disc priests will be taken, because that is bar none on of the worst specs for anything else in the game.  At least other healing specs are still good at 5man content for example, but shadow weaving is just pure trash at everything beyond deliberately applying weaving in a raid.
---
If my guild wanted me to be a shadow weaving healer, I would probably leave and find a guild I can actually main heal in, unless the guild agreed to pay for my two way respecc every raid.
---
You've also worked with Thrall / Jaina / Anduin so often, that ofc by this point in the story they are going to know you by name and be friendly with you. A blue said that before but after a certain point you can't just continue to be 'nameless unknown adventurer' because after a while it doesn't make any sense storywise.
---
Fair enough :) I consider myself fairly well versed in slang despite being Scandinavian, but this was a first :p
---
I'm not a huge fan of the go-engineering-or-go-home mentality, but man, Ret is the poster child for NEEDS engineering. Lack of tools to close on the enemy is your #1 weakness, and grenades fix that, not to mention the additional stun gives you another way to trigger a large JoC.
---
I don't even have a horse in this race and I still want it to happen. Good luck to you guys.
---
Please do. Less competition for me!
---
Beautiful
---
.. yes, those are the same. Layering so people can play the game, the alternative being a bunch of dead servers. Layers aren’t static, it wouldn’t make any sense for them to be that way. You could have a layet support thousands and thousands of people if they were all spread out, but they won’t be, so the layers will be small. The last time they tried releasing an expansion without aggressive sharding/layering is was a complete fucktastrophe. It doesn’t make any sense either to have big layers when they are continent wide, and you could have 3000 humans in one layer if they all pressed *enter game* at the same time.
---
Starting areas will still be crowded. They just won’t have a thousand level 1s in them.
---
Made my own based off a version of Onslaught. Simplified it and put my own spin on it.   
---
Raiders reserve loot and when that loot is dropped and they have it at top priority they get it. Top 5 reserve spots are locked out based on a few conditions like consecutive attendance, getting fully enchanted, bringing full consumes and we are toying around with a low hanging, jokey one. Fingers crossed that this system eliminates loot drama and lets people just focus on progressing.
---
You're such an intellectual!
---
It's easier to get +dagger skill from gear than it is +swords.
---
+sword only comes from a bwl weapon that is highly sought after and also a naxx weapon. 
---
+daggers is on a dire maul dagger, dire maul belt, and mc gloves.
---
The human racial isn't as big of a deal for rogues though as it is for warriors because rogues already get +5 weapon skill from combat talents.
---
I always bind autoattack to alt + f4
---
You wouldn't be able to kill Nef. Entire raid would get catformed and you'd just die.
---
Awesome story, I recall the BRM chaos!!! Although I think Searing Gorge was to the north, and had the shorter run than Buying Steppes to the south?
---
I just started to see if the game is for me and your points are some of the things I've been thinking about. I don't want to join a guild because of drama etc but I want to play the dungeons and higher level stuff and that's tough or impossible as a solo player.
---
I am not going to skip the first week but I have strategically planned my time off of work for the week of September 1st when the servers will definitely be reliable.
---
Its nerfed hard from pservers and it was barely viable there. Where are you making up the lost dps in classic?
---
I am also Spanish.  Please let us know which server you choose.
---
Gold is boe gear, consumables, enchants. Gold is an upgrade. I don't really care what you do but be prepared to see 9 need rolls in that UBRS as soon as the boe epic drops. You can still roll greed if it makes you feel good.
---
I heard hunter
---
I thought bear tanks couldn't completely avoid crushing blows?
---
Hey, I'm really enjoying these - as someone who missed the boat completely on WoW the first time around, they've been a solid part of building my hype for the game's potential.
---
Don't worry if they're not gaining too much traction, you can tell from how you write that these are tales you're wanting to tell. While people might not engage too much with them in the form of comments and upvotes, there's more to be said through getting a good story written down. Keep it up man - I'm looking forward to more of an insight into what Classic could be!
---
&gt;As a german i salute
---
Please not again
---
I think the only boe I would ever reserve is boe crafting patterns like flasks. But the reason I think it’s fair for our group to reserve is because we’ll fill all the main roles and honestly more often then not being coordinated will allow a pug to have a nice clean run.
---
DARK LADY WATCH OVER YOU
---
And in your story this lag (which I certainly didn't experience myself in vanilla) works only to the detriment of the alliance raiders and not to the hundreds of horde you say were camping BRM for over an hour on the offchance that there might be some PVP.
---
Like I said, very entertaining, just not something I can believe. Tell you what, if it's really so important to you that I believe you account for you to keep replying to me, just spit out the server name guild names so we can find some verification.
---
Not to mention, it is the Orc who kites the Tauren because he resists his intercept and the Tauren can't land his hamstring because he isn't in range.
---
Yeah,  no.
---
And I’d leave that group asap.
---
Do you really think Blizzard is going to allow 3000 people in the starting zones on a single layer? "Phase 1" could mean many months.
---
A human mage has 129 base intellect.
---
A gnome mage has 143 base intellect.
---
Your Phase 3 BIS gear gives 204 intellect.
---
With buffs and consumables you gain another 93, plus 10% on top.
---
So a gnome mage will have ~500 intellect whilst a human mage will have ~468.
---
That 32 intellect is worth 480 mana and ~0.54% spell critical strike chance.
---
So it's not insignificant but also not enough to warrant bringing a Gnome over a Mage to raid.
---
&gt; They don't use same spellbatching vanilla had. They just force delay into BFA client which is obviously problematic.
---
But that is the way it worked back then. They just compressed the batching and gave certain things priority over others in the modern game, spells over NPC dialogue boxes as an example.
---
[Source for spell batching, just read the first paragraph, and maybe the last.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/spell-batching-in-classic/137118)
---
There is no need to spread lies to support your stance.
---
He's just been focusing on testing routes since the announcement that the beta is ending July 12th. He's mentioned creating guides on youtube over the next 6 weeks after beta goes down, but he only has 2 starting area guides available at the moment [https://www.youtube.com/user/SpacedNeedle/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpacedNeedle/videos)
---
Tauren lady dance is rare and exquisite.
---
You might let someone who would use the upgrade take it. It'd be a nice gesture. If it's a group of friends, it's very likely to happen. If it's just a random pug, I just don't see it happening. 
---
It's not entitlement, by the way. Entitlement would be telling everyone else to pass on the big pile of gold that just dropped because your claim to it is more valid, somehow. It isn't.
---
&gt;how do you think the warriors and rogues are going to feel losing it to a hunter.
---
They can cry some more, since it's bis for hunters too. BiS is BiS. If hunters always passed it to the melee first, they would never get it.
---
Nice to hear about one of probably only a handful of druids in vanilla that actually tanked bosses, especially before the talent rework.
---
&gt;Just a lot of praise "Wow honey you're doing great!" "I can't believe you're doing so well!"
---
Just sounds very patronizing
---
I think you are under estimating how many people are planning to rush to 60 and do MC as fast as possible.  It won't be a huge number but enough to have a decent competition going
---
Knowing someone's email address would not be enough to login to their account, even without an authenticator. Even knowing someone's email address and their email password would not be enough to login to their account *with* an authenticator.
---
I seriously miss those days..
---
Hmm i see your point, if i join a serious raiding guild then probably moonglow/NS, if not then HotW/NS.
---
You guys also need to clarify that I guess were talking about pve.
---
As long as they aren't 3 crits in a row a druid won't die to that if they're using good mitigation gear and consumables. Even if it is 3 crits they can survive, but 3 boss attacks take 7.5 seconds to happen in almost all cases so there's loads of time for healers to react.
---
My shitty laptop might be able to get above 25fps.
---
It has nothing to do with skill in the game, I simply value my time much more than you do.
---
You are underestimating raiding in classic. MC, ZG and AQ20 are easy enough to clear with anything eventually.  BWL, AQ40 and Naxx will be beyond what most will clear. Because even though the mechanics are easy, so is retail in Heroic and most don't get the ahead of the curve. 
---
For instance, wiping on Zul (uldir retail) for 5 hours because priests kept forgetting to dispel isn't much different from wiping on Chrom (BWL vanilla) because you didn't use the sand and blew up the tanks. Ppl are just as bad, connections are better so it's just more obvious. Every expansion I see terrible players while raiding, no reason classic is going to be any different.
---
I am not trolling when I say I intend to buy all the gold I want in WoW Classic. Nor are most of my comments intended to be taken as trolling.
---
Hopefully not too soon, so many people rocking T3 and Thunderfury in this
---
No it isn't. It's to prevent empty servers after the tourist rush ends. Low amount of servers, high amount of layers. Reduced crowding in starting zones is just an added convenience.
---
Go seek validation somewhere else scrub.
---
Removing Sharding would be enought to make me resub
---
It's so painful that it's no more World or Warcraft, but Shards/Instances of Warcraft
---
IIRC, there's nothing from LW that you'd want that isn't also BOE. So if you do well dual-gathering while you level, you can buy a few choice pieces, or commission them with some of your skinning bounty.
---
I've been struggling with this same question, though I decided (with great advice from this sub) to go dual-gather while leveling, and then swap to enchanting once I get closer to 60. 
---
The reason being that I DO want Smoking Heart of the Mountain, and I do plan to tank. But Enchanting is a (ha!) bear to level, and very slow. There's no reason it should be my main profession while I'm leveling, as it takes up the space of a useful-while-leveling profession like gathering. 
---
Once I get to 60, drop one of the gatherings, then start enchanting. I also plan to have an alt that tailors, so this should be a handy duo.
---
I don't think you understand how much hundreds of hours is. Just calculate how many raid days is 400 hours, 600, 800? We will see just how long the raids will stay uncleared once they come available.
---
Man that's a lot of words to just say you suck at the game. Git gud.
---
how are you going to know any hunters if you avoid them all? lol
---
And how do you prevent empty servers? Oh yeah, by allowing more people to choose that server. And how do you allow more people to choose that server? Oh yeah, by not having crowded starting zones.
---
My loot council doesn’t debate. Class leads dole put gear and always know who gets loot when it drops. If it’s something multiple classes can use then they trade out each week.
---
I have no doubt a few dozen will really make the effort. I doubt any will succeed.
---
I'm not seeking anything. Just speaking the truth.
---
Ya thats what we are talking about.
---
i raided MC all the way up to AQ40 as a hunter a regularly topped damage meters. I dunno if i'd call that hot garbage
---
It seems like you completely missed the point of the post, as for how I don't know, looking to the name of the thread. 
---
If you don't have anything constructive to come with simply don't reply, this thread isn't here to spread hatred, it's to help.
---
I'm not claiming to know all the answers, all I'm saying is that you don't either. He had a functioning authenticator and his account was compromised. Facts.
---
Can't warlocks summon people inside the instance?
---
Sperg
---
Yeah, I never did figure out why they all dropped off at that odd rank, just randomly they all dropped off in around the same week of playing
---
classic will be dead in 6 months. most of the people on here talking about how they are going to take 2 weeks off work and leave their wife and kids won't even make it out of the 45-55 level range.
---
I love your post, so much that last night my kids asked “daddy can we hear about how vanilla wow pvp clans work again?”
---
Try sixtyupgrades.com and create custom attribute values based on the stats you want (such as stamina=10, str=8, int=6 etc). You can then create sets of gear for each phase and view the itemscore for every item in each slot. 10x better than using a list!
---
Sounds like someone's pissed their career choice doesn't pay enough to just buy all the gold they want. QQ. Best of luck on your next GED exam, I'm sure you won't fail this time. That assistant manager position at McDonald's has your name written all over it!
---
The game was balanced around these factors.
---
Nah I'll roll need and give it to the guy that will actually use it. Think of me like a bonus roll, one more shot for justice in the universe.
---
Can confirm, although I didn’t see that movie til i was almost 30.
---
He was an idiot. Fact.
---
I have such a strong dislike for Alliance. I know we're at war, but Allys always seem to do the strangest, pettiest things that I just never see Horde doing. I'll be standing in a inn and every ally that passes will debuff me and run, spit on me and run, kill me if I'm inactive and run before someone kicks their ass, etc. They're great at trolling and running away, not so great at fighting. I play as an ally and the Horde either ignores me or actually fights me. 
---
Ally is for assholes, Horde has honor.
---
Hold on, let me cast aimed shot.
---
Screw crossroads it’s all about owning all the zeppelins for hours as alliance 
---
&gt;:)
---
Exactly
---
Ah, bush form.
---
I own a company sperg, cry more
---
I never really remember having issues with doors on my (male) Tauren shaman throughout Vanilla, I mean if you’re mounted, yeah but didn’t everyone have that?
---
Druids can tank kt as well, druids were great in bc and they gained like 5%dr. Crits don't matter to a bear with armor cap and more hp than a warrior. You won't die even from b2b Crits as rare as that is. Plus druid threat is way easier to let your DPS go ham. Maul is crazy tps. And with hotw you can off role some fights, also most mana for dispels.
---
Nah in vanilla you can only summon inside of an instance if they're inside of it with you.
---
Fuck I read this in my head as 35 minutes and had a fit
---
I give you this question, OP: Why should I take the hit and greed/pass, when there is no guarantee others will do so for me?
---
The community in WoW has changed drastically over the years. A lot of players with the mindset of me first will play this game. If the norm on my server develops to be "all need on BoEs and BiS items", why would I ever not do so myself?
---
The reason not to do it is the fear of backlash. If there is a societal expectation that I'm gonna roll need, there will be no backlash.
---
Sure, I could be nice and pass the Blackcrow or Warden Staff, but that doesn't sound like it has any benefit to me. This could be my 12th run in LBRS while the hunter is on his first run. I've maybe lost 3 crossbows already. BoEs not being "all need" is honestly baffling to me. On my server back then, everyone rolling need was common for BoEs.
---
If the rogue wants his HoJ, he can reserve it and create a group. I won't honor a request to pass after it drops if I need it myself, chances are it's the only reason I'm even in the dungeon.
---
I'd call your guild mates hot garbage then...
---
Solid fuckin gold. The muse of a generation right here!
---
Anyone with a few dollars can own a company.
---
Additionally it's not realistic that one rogue was handling all of the pillars for suppression room single-handedly. You have to leap-frog with at least two rogues if you're doing the traditional gauntlet method rather than pulling the entire suppression room in two waves and sappering it down.
---
Just PvP in Prot spec.  Confuse people with your sword and board and then smack them with your shield.
---
I highly doubt more than a tiny fraction has done this :p
---
As a matter of interest since everything can be vendored do you just need everything or is there a minimum amount of money required for you to be a ninja?
---
everyone on reddit is a ceo, lol. running an ebay store out of your parent's garage isn't "owning a company", sorry.
---
I think there were fewer places you really *needed* to run through a door in Vanilla, but yeah, pretty much everyone fits through doors while at least male Tauren need to manually dismount. It's a pet peeve even in retail still.
---
As a retribution paladin your two main professions should be:
---
1. Begging - gotta get into those groups somehow
---
2. Pretending to be a hot female - gotta get that loot somehow
---
It still happened, despite you saying it couldn't. Fact.
---
I don't need validation from you sperg, bye.
---
I could never do dailies, ever since BC. It has always felt like a chore. However I could spend all day farming herbs and ore with LotR extended marathon going on the tv 👍
---
Yeah in vanilla they didnt have vampiric touch
---
good luck on your auctions.
---
Glitching through the wall to stand behind the counter with the auctioneers.
---
Awesome. Its nice to see the RP community is bigger than it was at 2004
---
No. You can get shadow weaving and Power infusion and still be a healer. S.Priest barely scales in dmg from MC to Naxx.
---
Well said. Just because someone’s new doesn’t give them a free pass to be a dick. If you’re new and don’t listen to constructive criticism or tips then that’s on you if your group is an ass to you. That being said, new people who do listen and try to learn and improve are awesome, and should be  treated with respect.
---
Undercity&gt;Everything
---
LUL Imagine being mad at someone's choice of how they spend their money.
---
My friend played Alliance during Vanilla, and I've been playing Horde since starting in TBC.  
---
We're going to play Classic together, and I asked him what faction we're going to play on (I prefer Horde).  
---
"Alliance sucks" he told me.  
---
"And that's why you're my friend" :D
---
On BOPs roll greed for vendoring need for equipping. High value BOEs everyone needs.
---
I'm not a ninja, I get 1/5 or 1/10 chance to get the item. Like everybody else. People trying to convince you that they need the big pile of gold more than you are the ninjas.
---
You can party with a friend and move to uncommon zones once a split happens, such as the barrens silverpine split. I just level casually and look for dungeons until the zerg is over tbh..
---
Youre getting a GPD WIN2 also eh?? 😂
---
Wait, really? This is a game changer.
---
It actually is true but regardless your still overly complicating the group making. How do you deal with the layering CD? Very inconvenient for pugs when you literally have hundreds of people to choose from to run groups with.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
We really need to stop with these posts every other day.
---
The pummelers are not a requirement for druid tanking, they are useful for certain fights but you do not need them for everything you tank.
---
Yes druids can tank, yes they can heal, yes you can do subpar dps. Just play the fucking class you want to play.
---
I mean, in both you ‘grind’
---
When I saw the reference to enjoying teens, I expected to see a bad Epstein meme.
---
Which is fine cause they didn’t have 1000 level 1’s in them at any release other than pservers...
---
The reason why some form of lee-way and spell batching is required is because the games balance was built around these mechanics. Removing both has real consequences for pvp and pve.
---
Yes they will, but you won’t be in a guild that does it quickly.
---
This is so fucking true
---
Now this is a quality meme 😂😂
---
I'll probably roll a Druid toward the end of Classic, assuming tBC would be next. tBC made Druid much more viable.
---
Playing Horde for first time and I ask everything in the chat area... googling takes me out of the game. Asking is fun!
---
Going to be rolling mage as a three part leveling team with a shaman and a warrior what professions should I choose?
---
I remember a 38 or 39 man priest raid in vanilla times killing Onyxia as well.
---
The primary objective of layering is to prevent dead servers long term when tourists leave. Nothing else is the primary objective.
---
you cant change retail tbh just nake classic + the most wholesome WoW ever
---
On the flipside, i reaaallly wanted to play male NE hunter but i just cant because he looks so ridiculous when shooting bow/gun/xbow. Like he is dancing back and forth and waving his weapon all over the place instead of the steady aim that every other character has. Also shoots the bow sideways and brings the gun all the way back almost behind him
---
What is the crippled kid from Degrassi doing as an orc?
---
I love the way wow is. But definitely like these unreal renders. I would definitely try something like that if it was released
---
I agree with everything but PvP. Structured rated PvP (Arenas and RBGs) having their own gear and vendors was one of the best things they did for that side of the game. I don't care if you want don't want "fair" fights in pub games but in rated you shouldn't be able to beat people with PvP gear unless they make it so PvP rewards the same exact gear you get through raiding.
---
You **are** the brute squad.
---
Just 2x eh
---
Leveling as a prot pally on nost I can tell you that making group comps that aren't warrior/priest/mage/rogue/hunter makes for some extremely fun dungeons.
---
You can bring (almost) whatever you want and have a good time figuring out how to make it work in 5 mans the whole way to 60.
---
&gt; Yeah, because getting "hacked" is still a thing with the Authenticator...
---
Tell me more
---
I'm a good player, easygoing, and patient with noobs. But I don't have time to raid.
---
So I'll be the guy everyone asks, "Why don't you raid?"
---
I hope not because I took off the 26th and the 27th
---
If you skip a week you will not only fail to level faster, you will make your world PvP experience miserable.
---
You will be tanked by impossible to win against situations and you'll rage log. Don't do it.
---
Just don’t play Ret 😜

This hit just the spot. Thank you so much for the time you put into witting it. I look forward to your future posts and am going to head bald to check out your others! I truly hope some culture like this reforms around Classic :)
---
Nope.
---
Hey,
---
I played this game way back when I was 15-18. I'm 30 now and I am starting to pay more attention to the Classic WoW release. Definitely going to give it a try and play casually! 
---
Anyways, I wanted to share this clip that I uploaded in 2006. It's one of my favorite moments from back in the day. I hope you guys enjoy! I think it captures the spirit of the game back then pretty well!

&gt;No your actually ignoring the quesion because you don't have an answer. And its fun to watch the squirming from this end :D
---
You seem to be the one squirming.
---
&gt;You refuse or probably can't answer how "I'm unit of culture" makes a complete thought or sentence.
---
This is the first mention of "I'm unit of culture", of course that doesn't make sense. Just because a joke is a unit of culture doesn't mean you can take the word joke and replace it with unit of culture in any context. 
---
A car is a mode of transport.  Would you go around saying I'm driving in the mode of transport pool lane?
---
Your previous statement of "I'm using a unit of culture" made perfect sense instead of winning the argument for you, so now you're doubling down. 
---
Now I don't want to call you stupid, but from my point of view it looks like I'm part of an argument with an idiot. You're failing to follow any logic and just coming up with stupider arguments. Can you please prove me wrong on this point as I'm sure you aren't an idiot.
---
Counterpoint: Entire human history
---
While I love what you did here.  I kinda wish you used this scene from Once upon a Deadpool.
---
For 99.99% of the population, that remains true.
---
For your moron of a friend, well, there's always suicide.
---
I'll be doing something similar.  I'll use Joana's guide to keep on track, but mix in some dungeons and group quests that he doesn't go over.  That way I can keep ahead of his guide and benefit from doing quests a level or two ahead.
---
The games balance was also built around items, spells, talents, and content being released in  phases. We're getting all the updated versions of spells and talents right out the gate. That fundamentally changes all aspects of both PvP and PvE. It won't even be close to the first patch of actual vanilla. Like not even close. Druid for example had two of their 31 point talents rolled into their class skills, and some of their abilities gave twice the bonuses. 
---
Then you have items thay won't be updated, just gated. So that argument also doesn't hold any water by itself. You would have to say that you are trying to keep the same "feel" of the game. The problem is nobody remembers how it felt. So just don't make it feel like shit.
---
To each his own. I don’t agree with anything there other than class balance being better in TBC. It’s hard to say TBC was better when you fail to mention AQ40, AQ20, ZG, and half of naxx.
---
For spells and ranged attacks specifically, not melee auto attacks correct? 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0
---
&gt;Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks.
---
Not really; the game is going back to 1.12, which was just a small part of vanilla. For example, feral druids got massive buffs over the course of vanilla and are far more viable in 1.12 than in earlier patches. This wasn't really something that became commonly accepted back in the day though, since the 'bad reputation' certain classes (also warlocks) got didn't really fade.
---
Even when you try to make horde sound boring, I'm pretty sure "dead bois" and "hippie axe bois" are my soul spirits
---
That's one reason everyone says they are great off tanks but no one said they are the main tank.
---
Glorious! 
---
Thank you for this!
---
Horde till I die baby!
---
SUBALUWA
---
I wouldn't dislike them being permanently added, limited edition like in actual vanilla would be cancer.
---
How was life in private servers in a sub par guild?
---
This alone makes me so excited
---
Reality in a game that isn’t real must hit as hard as the pixels
---
I like your writing style.
---
Yep exact same boat as me.
---
I guess so, still had MC / BWL / AQ20 / ZG on farm and downed a handfull of bosses in AQ40
---
Nah, I had ZG gear, and a ZG sword, and I could beat some grand marshals in 1v1 as a paladin wearing 3 greens and lightforge spaulders. I just used trinkets, and consumables.
---
Things that people with uber gear wouldn't equip in order to take down a paladin in mere lightforge paulders if they had the stats to blow me up in 3 hits.
---
I have never seen any RP server in the history of the game play like that RP is very much an "as you feel like it" activity, and the only thing you are expected to do is not get in the way of people who are RPing. Other than that you just do what you want like normal.
---
If I was your boss I would say to you “I used to be an adventurer like you, until I took an arrow in the knee.”
---
I think boomkin is gonna require even more optimization and consumables if you want to dps as much as tanks.
---
&gt; I’m not sure the game can run at 144 Hz
---
It can.
---
&gt; what do you think the best resolution would be for a monitor that size?
---
If you got the Samsung CJG5, set everything to 2560x1440. Your 980 TI is overkill already, probably way above 144 fps.
---
Don't forget to set Windows to 144 too.
---
do you avoid warlocks too since they have pets as well?
---
Explanation: Capitalism has inherent flaws that are going to kill us all and that has nothing to do with human nature
---
loooolmflmao xD
---
The argument, "that's mount money!" is so incredibly selfish. It blows my mind that so many players happily ignore Blizzard's in-game solution because of what other people \*might\* do. The unavoidable truth is that they're justifying their own self-centered behavior.
---
This is a bit much. I joined vanilla late and leveled up quite happily on a PvP server.
---
This is a followup to my post [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1p5so/i\_am\_writing\_an\_addon\_for\_leveling\_guides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1p5so/i_am_writing_an_addon_for_leveling_guides/)
---
I was a bit surprised by the end of the beta so I hurried up to relase a first running test version of my addon so that you can try it out for the last days (and also in the stress test).
---
Guides are shown as a list of steps where the progress is updated automatically as much as possible (quests picked up / completed, quest items looted / mobs killed, etc). Only for some steps completion has to  be confirmed manually (such as resupplying, getting new skills, etc). Locations referenced in the guide are shown on the map and minimap. Also  there is an arrow pointing in the direction of the next step.
---
The addon comes with an editor so even if the number of guides  included is small (yet) it is very easy to create your own guides or to  import your favorite guide.
---
You can find it at: [https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime/](https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime/)
---
Have fun trying it out and feel free to give me your feedback.
---
If you happen to have your own guides that you would like to see in an addon also feel free to contact me as I am still looking for people that would like to contribute guides.
---
Thanks.  When I went into wows options last night I only saw 75hz options.
---
Update: I released a beta version of my addon!
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cc24jq/guidelime\_a\_new\_addon\_for\_leveling\_guides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cc24jq/guidelime_a_new_addon_for_leveling_guides/)
---
I loved my warrior back in vanilla i was arms (did care to much for fury) I've done some raids during that time but I completed MC,zg,onxy,aq20 and 4 bosses in bwl never got to aq40 :/
---
The problem is you're defining the hardcore players ONLY by their PvE. I disagree entirely. In Classic there used to be more than one way to be hardcore:
---
- Auction House Fiends.
---
- Hardcore Farmers.
---
- PvP Ranking Fiends.
---
- Raid Elitists.
---
- Hardcore Gankers.
---
- Trinket collectors.
---
- That guy who wants Ironfoe.
---
- That paladin hosting Molten Core pugs so he can get Thunderfury.
---
There used to be multiple ways to "go hard" in classic. Now the hardcore players are basically ONLY raiders... there's really nothing else left.
---
That's it, I'm downloading this whole series to watch while leveling.
---
Can't believe not mentioned here.  Bind B to open all bags.
---
Ele/resto Shaman also work fine for all mentioned things. Its just a solid spec overall.
---
I love sheeping alli hunters and killing their pets before I kill them. Hope you brought some extra food for your sad friend!
---
What's the CD on Wyvern? 2 mins and wait what? It's a poison and paladins:
---
*Exist*
---
Watching that clip makes me sad for the people rolling druids. Leeway is so much further in the beta and that guy would have been tooled even harder than he already was. Oh well. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
---
This is a good meme and also genuinely fills me with pride.
---
Pugs = auto-need
---
&gt;as opposed to having that set for you by "keeping up with the joneses." If you see this as a lack of content, then there are a lot of games out there for you that might be more fun for you.
---
I should mention that I come from sandbox games where "making your own fun" was usually just another way to say that the game didn't have much to offer. Thus someone should be careful with that phrase.
---
They tend to not use their pets in dungeons. If they do then it's an imp that's phase shifted for stam buff.
---
This is neat, but I'm not sure displaying so many guide steps is necessary, especially since they're difficult to read in any case.
---
Hey, spoiler alert!
---
Can we please just have this post deleted? RES users may never even see this comment, and with OP's edits, the warning is kind of buried in the OP.
---
OP has made a dangerous product that, at best, exposes personal data to risk, and at worst, actively places it in the hands of malicious actors.
---
Frankly, it's telling that you view everything in terms of your own benefit. The fact that you'd roll on a HoJ as a hunter is flat out ridiculous. You'll have much more fun with this game if you view it as an enjoyable social experience rather than, "I want it all, screw everyone else!"
---
When you play with random people, you are indirectly an ambassador of your guild. Hence, a somewhat charitable attitude will benefit you in the long run. Being nice (or atleast respectful) to strangers is a great way to make new friends.
---
I'm not saying you should abstain from rolling on useful items, but that it's worth taking the usefulness for other people into consideration too, be that a friend or a stranger (aka future friend). 
---
Let's not forget that positive reputation on the server is a valuable currency too.
---
Except that Capitalism was formed by human desires, if not it wouldn't exist. Therefore human nature
---
Pretty sure you can animate with Wallpaper engine if you have it
---
Absolutely, I LOVED mana potioning every 2 minutes, because even WITH that, I was struggling at intense moments.
---
Many of my Nef/C'thun/KT kills, I was completely oom and running on fumes for the last few minutes of the fight.
---
RemindMe! 1 year
---
&gt;I’m just saying that healer classes are expected to heal
---
Why though? Are tank classes expected to only tank? Are dps classes expected to only dps?
---
So level cap is 40 but you get most your ablities pre 40. True you can't test at 60 but just raw values go up, so its pretty well tested.
---
So as well as being a needlessly aggressive dick, you were also attuned to The Eye and Serpentshrine Cavern in the first week?

Why not though? The only reason so few people cleared old naxx was it was hardly out for very long before BC came out. Also don't forget how good player retention was in classic despite only a small portion of the player-base completing raids.
---
You can tell from a mile away that he is going to overreact on purpose.
---
https://www.avoidstreamers.com
---
Check the monitor settings. You might need to enable it on the monitor. Also make sure the cable you are using can display 144hz.
---
Why wouldn't they just summon him since the whole raid was inside bwl...?
---
Servers aren’t even announced yet, but it seems most of them aren’t going to announce beforehand to save themselves a few minutes of time before snipers find out where they are anyway.
---
I don’t get it
---
When someone says you have no honour, and your  reply is “where are the rules” 
---
You sir,  have no honour
---
Already a thing. Thats the Pre-made group finder. Its the only way to do Mythic or higher dungeons or Normal and higher raids. And there is no teleporting.
---
&gt; 1) they need to improve on world building. I personally hate that it fees less like a world and more like a matchmaker now. It’s inconvenient but I liked having to go to town and buy ammo or poison. Or having to level my pet if I get a new one. Or even having to talk to other players...These things made your character feel embedded in the world.
---
WoW retail - it's an ARPG, with multiplayer aspects.
---
Perhaps, but currently it isn't. Currently it's human nature and the inability to see the greater good for us as a species (and all those others as well) which is further veiled by the greed for money, the stupidity to deny it and the weakness to take that money. 
---
Humanity as a whole is just stupid. Few individuals are smart enough to work out what would be best for us but the stupid horde simply overthrows any rational thinking because "muh needs are more important than our survival lawl". And so the story concludes. India is a pretty hot spot right now, i wonder what could have been done to prevent that...
---
Very true. Blizz failed to realise that by making every gear drop something with useful stats so that you could gradually progress each piece by 1-5% stat bonus by grinding is nowhere near as satisfying as using a piece of shit bit of gear or weapon and there being nothing better for a long time/many levels and then upgrading it for a huge boost.
---
me:  "I've got my future Undead Priest all planned out, down to the finest detail of his questing path!"
---
my future Undead Priest:  \*revs up his wands\*
---
me:  "But we still have 45 days left..."
---
my future Undead Priest:  "MY LIFE FOR SYLVANAS!"
---
me:  "MY LIFE FOR SYLVANAS!"
---
The point was druids are rubbish without a stack of mcp’s. Which of course is bullshit.
---
I tried retail again recently and I spent most of my time just standing in orgrimmar waiting for queues to pop. Terrible.

---
The dark lady has no honor!
---
In the stress test it searched the entire server. Storm wind showed the max of 50 people while it was almost empty on the layer i was in.
---
The kid should be talking about WoW while the old man should be talking about Ultimate Online and the OG Xroads
---
I remember elitist minmaxers back in 2006 still had to pay attention on wtf they were doing otherwise they wiped. All the incorrect numbers on the pservers add up and give you plenty of advantage. A little hit rating here, a little crit rating there... But we will see in a few months.
---
Holy crap dude, I remember watching this 10 years ago with my brother. Brings back great memories, great video!
---
I think the top 5 WoW streamers intend to be on the same server, not because they care about the players but because they want to play with each other.
---
I know that.
---
When the BFA trailer dropped there was some streamer doing a reaction video and when Varian yells *'For the Alliance!'* she said *'Nobody says that'* and it made me laugh because so many NPCs say that.
---
Yup. That's exactly how it worked. 
---
The current leeway is clearly borked as fuck.
---
This is actually well played.  This is what I did.  Spend 4 days of leave and get 7 days of uninterrupted play time (assuming you don't work Labor Day).
---
Is it?  What's the DPS of a feral with and without MCP?
---
Dude i have lived 3 places in the last 10 year and the best i get is 80-110 ping on modern servers. Unless you ONLY live in large cities Ping is still often an issue. 
---
Most people don't even know 56k had BANDWIDTH limitations in most mmos, wow had it, daoc had it, most mmos coming out ran into this issue. 
---
In 08 high end bandwidth for wow was 30KBs  Typically 5KBs, 56k was 56kbits .
---
30KBs = 240kbits 
---
5KBs =  40kbits
---
Ping wasn't even the only issue. For a lot of people. 
---
Furthermore, while DSL was faster with lower ping, often times where you were at had no fast connection to the data centers back then providing you a good amount of ping regardless of broadband or not.
---
Did you know that not everyone cares about raiding? I played 2 druids to 60 during vanilla and played all roles with both of them. In some dungeon groups I would change between dps, tank and heal all during a single pull. 
---
They are perfectly viable hybrids for the majority of the game.
---
Ah, fair enough.  That is pretty funny.  Cheers!
---
Needs 21 points in both trees. Totally doable. Sounds fun.
---
Holly shit yes I was looking for the reason I knew this guys name. Old husky videos..
---
&gt; Do people really say this? Classic was designed specifically for players new to MMORPGs
---
Activision employees might.
---
&gt;Don't play that game! Play this game! It's got amazing mechanics like a slot machine! And it cares about your time!! Unlike THAT game!
---
Gotta play to your audience man.
---
Gonna start calling you Deckard Cain. "Stay awhile, and listen."
---
Yeah, like I said, this would be the definite wow killer. Imagine starting a game where people are 15 years worth of gear ahead of you. No one would start playing wow. If you have 0 players coming in and &gt;0 players going out, your game dies.
---
And btw, Naxx level gear was not replaced in hellfire peninsula. Not even close. Iirc karazhan was first cleared in T6. Thunderfury was bis tanking weapon throughout most (all?) of TBC as well. I can't speak for current expacs because I have not played them.
---
Even with 1% of the playerbase seeing AQ40, the reason was:
---
1) Time investment required, there was a fraction of the population that even ATTEMPTED molten core because of this. 
---
2) Information share wasn't there in vanilla. Knowing what bosses did, what you needed to bring, HOW TO SPEC OR ROTATIONS! None of this was common knowledge, now we have youtube, twitch, guides everything is drilled down and people have access to so much more information.
---
3) WE WERE FREAKING TERRIBLE in comparison to now. If you look at the first dungeon in TBC (Ramparts) it is as hard mechanically, as MC. We have leveled up by far.
---
Raiding the endgame in Vanilla, quite often you need to catch up in gear before attempting Naxx. (You cannot walk in full blues and expect to even touch the bosses) There was no catch up mechanic. So most people didn't want to invest the time.
---
We don't know how long the timeline is going to be, or even when after Naxx release TBC (if it happens) will come out, or if the server is going to lock at T3 forever. 
---
Time will tell.
---
Ugh, now I need to declare loot rules for every group I join. The system is very self explanatory. The greed button is literally there for you to take the item for the gold value.
---
As you wish
---
Yeah so all those people with GREAT broadband... well not if it had a bad route to vanilla servers :P
---
Wyvern is a poison which makes it less good.
---
&lt;3 Peter Faulk
---
Working as intended isn't the same as, working the same as vanilla. Should experience the same as vanilla isn't the same as vanilla.
---
Word games.
---
I'm just echoing myself at this point saying that sentiment is shoved down the throat of anyone who has been on the sub for a day. Let people play what they want. Have fun being mage#628849
---
&gt;She didn’t hate it! She is actually looking forward to playing again because once she is level 8 she can turn into a cat. I’m getting very hopeful that she will want to roll a classic char next month. 
---
 She might love/hate it more in classic, Cat is @ 20 in classic. I couldn't level a druid pre-cata past 9 to save my life. 
---
u/ironskillet2 - Entirely what this guy said. Leave alone. Let her fiddle with it as she pleases, The best way to make someone not wanna play a game is to show them the ropes and rush them to  end game, and expect someone to be there yesterday.
---
Yup that's the problem. Just switch to DisplayPort and you should be good!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBOCOfSyORc
---
The way the slow effect is applied on Blizzard is wrong.
---
In Classic, the slow is applied by the damage, which isn't how it worked in vanilla. It's exacerbated by the ridiculously huge batching window.
---
The game is going back to vanilla but also there’s only a fraction of the items available at the start so the pvp sets, zg and aq sets are not available at the start which helped feral Druids immensely.  
---
Also what about prot/ret paladins? Shadowpriests? Everyone says how useful feral is (and it is, don’t get me wrong) but nobody wants to say how useless the others are.
---
I took it with a hint of embellishment. Good story, I can see a situation where something like this could have happened to an extent. Maybe a combination of stories of shenanigans that did happen in BRM, and possibly a straw that broke the camels back.
---
I feel like OP has maybe played some EVE Online or watched a couple of RNK videos and got a bit inspired. Enjoy the story for what it is and just take it at whatever value you think it's worth.
---
Geez. Just imagine how good you could have gotten sooner if that person had kinda taken you under their wing and tried to help you instead of tear you down. :( I'm glad it didn't break you, but man... I can't imagine treating someone else that way.
---
If 8 hours a week is a significant amount of time then those people won't be level 60 for ~30 weeks.  I'd be surprised if they're even still playing, let alone taking the time to gear up and raid.
---
If you don't "no life" the game you aren't going to be raiding so there's no sense in even worrying about it.  You're not going to raid if you can't play 8 hours a week.
---
&gt; You help no one with this.
---
This can help people understand what the majority of the community will be expecting of them. Therefore will help them to have realistic expectations of their choices and set attainable goals. Read through the thread again, you will see that there are *options* available for hybrid specs, but the most realistic option they have is to respec for raids, and respec back for solo work.
---
I'll be playing a Shaman, so *if* I end up wanting to raid I know that my best chance to be included will be to go full Resto. That's not the only way to play the game though, so while leveling, in dungeons, world pvp, and pre-raid set up, I'll probably try out multiple hybrid specs depending on what gear I can get my hands on.
---
And have a Hunter alt to grind for gold like a madman.
---
You forgot buffing the entire raid with blessing of light. Not only tanks that want it.
---
My point is with 5 paladins you can give the entire raid the additional blessing, which will likely be blessing of sanctuary. It reduced damage taken from all sources by 24 for the entire raid. So think of a fight like firemaw/vael/huhu where the entire raid is taking repetitive damage. 40x24 is 960 damage. So your raid is taking 960 less damage every few seconds on firemaw. Thats like 300 hps from 1 extra paladin. Before the paladin even heals anything themselves!
---
Gonna rp walk to the dungeons? ;P
---
Client side, and as thats the Client's code pserver use the SAME exact code (everyone uses 1.12 client). 
---
That code is to see if you can click an ability to request the server to process it. (To diminish the number of request to the server.)
---
I've only ever played RuneScape 13 years ago in the MMO category, my usual games are Rocket League, Dark Souls, and indie games like Enter the Gungeon and Splunky, but I'm excited for classic WoW. Sorry if I don't meet your standard for gaming, but either way I'm gonna play. You'll probably be able to kill me in the game, but it's a game so who really gives a fuck?
---
Old animations and combat.
---
mmm that was kinda nice
---
Classic runs on the 8.0 engine which sure as hell won't run on potatoes. My 1080Ti is getting loud af for 4k/60fps on retail, and while the graphics on classic won't be as demanding they wont be much far from it. I heavily doubt OP will be able to reach 144fps at 2k with that graphics card.
---
Nice dude. I'd try drawing mine but it's gnome druid so it's just a blank page... For now... 😑
---
Yes and with 200+ fps.
---
No problem man. We're all here for a love of the game, and to be arm-chair devs for a couple of minutes. :)
---
Then it’s the dankest timeline.
---
I never knew people actually tipped for this when they could just logout, create a new character, remove the clothes, and /dance.
---
How the fuck did you remember that?
---
It becomes an issue when it allows a max level ganker to attack lowbies -- and those lowbies kill him, and he gets away without consequence.
---
Thought that wasn’t until TBC when they got Vampiric Touch or whatever it was.
---
I wrote exactly that: as an enhancement shaman your best chance of getting raid gear is by being friends with the GM. Now, I'd you're the GM that only makes it so much easier.. 
---
Just remember that an enhancement shaman getting more gear than the "real" DPS classes is a great way to have unhappy guild members. But that's all up to you of course, when it's your own guild.
---
5% hp doesn't really do anything unless you're dipping under 5% hp during a fight. If you keep falling under 5% HP in raid fights you need new healers, not 5% more HP
---
This feels too real
---
He will be just fine retail still runs on potatoes lol calm down
---
Terrible guide. Doesn't even list a pve daggers build.  Wowhead is and always will be trash. Use classicdb for items, and google Oto rogue guide for a proper read. Can't link it due to the website name and this discord's mod rules.
---
If you were a hots pro when hots died does that mean you're still a hots pro?
---
:thinking:
---
Ya, I thought I relied to someone else. I was agreeing with someone that made the, not until TBC point.
---
Deep Frost Mages, Seal Fate Rogues, most Hunters, Disc Priests, Holy Paladins, Ele+Resto Shaman, SM+Ruin Warlocks, and HotW Druids.
---
There is a streamer who cleared Naxx in real vanilla Wow to the point of speed running it. He tanked the majority of bosses through all raids as Druid bear. Sure some fights aren't bear friendly.
---
1.12 bear tanking being shit is a meme. The more we learn from Classic testing (from leaked test realm raid testing), the more we learn that pserver raiding is quite wrong mechanically.
---
I don't see Classic's meta being light years different, but I am extremely interested in seeing the true meta. Only about 1% of players remember the real 1.12 experience properly. The majority of opinions are meaningless and based on memes created from previous patches.
---
HAHA, I did this too, but spent 5 hours getting my corpse back.
---
You're thinking more like genocidal despots? Yeah I guess that'd work too, but that's a little dramatic dude, it's just a video game.

Retail does run on old computers yes, but he is asking for 2k/144fps gaming on a budget GPU which most likely won't be able to run it even with the old settings.
---
I feel like levels 50-60 were like 60% of my gameplay when I was leveling my first character. In my brain, I remember leveling 1-60 taking like a year... I wonder how long it really took me.
---
It also took me a while to realize that you *have* to quest if you want to level up at a reasonable pace. In my 50s I started seeing mages AoE farming WPL and thought I could do the same on my rogue... was not helpful.
---
I'd get such bad motion sickness from that. Ill be against those kind of graphics till the day!!!! I stop gaming ☹️
---
Another "Am i in the beta" post? Bubble hs out
---
I can't get the time off, got a massive project due the day of launch and its going to flow over a couple of days, ill jump on at night and play a little here and there, but come Thursday night I have everything sorted for 5 glorious days of solid wow.  The wife is even going to her sisters for the time as she says "so I don't annoy you".
---
I plan on playing on the streamer server so that I can participate in the cool events and ensure my server will always be super populated.  You get used to 10k on private servers so I'm not worried about having a super full server and actually enjoy seeing people in the world no matter where I go.
---
What if you wait to be the last because someone might want it and if thats the case you don't want to win it?
---
For example, a staff drops for a mage and a priest. The priest waits, if the mage rolls needs then the priest pass, if the mage rolls greed, the priest rolls need.
---
That something I normally do on pservers and I will never consider it ninja looting
---
It was never really hard, it was long and slow though.
---
But the game was also about levelling then, so it's going to be an interesting culture shift for the elites.
---
&gt;Whoah mate, don't just name drop FD as being fucked
---
This isn't name dropping. That concept is incorrectly used in this discussion.  To Name drop i would need to say Sodapoppin says FD is fine or bad. That is name dropping. And is an appeal to authority fallacy. 
---
&gt;then in the next sentence say current leeway is acceptable 
---
I didn't, in context I said that spell batching is acceptable, but is really messing with a few classes abilities like FD. This would indicate that maybe it shouldn't mess with them... But this was a thing in vanilla. FD resisted and sometimes got killed by lag or spell batching. I do remember this. But currently, there is another issue in that you don't drop combat on client side right away which i think you should to be like vanilla (allowing a Shadowmeld or trap placement). Still server side you maybe hit immediately and thus kicked right back out of FD but at least you will get your trap down.
---
&gt;Me: Leeway is just bad. 
---
Pretty clear i didn't say it was good. Its possible in pvp it was a thing, but in pve it looks awfully implemented and not vanilla like at all.
---
I mean the best argument i have seen for hunters and leeway being different is hunters now have no dead zone.
---
How salty is a dps going to be when a healer rolls on Briarwood reed

Tanking instances for gold or reserved drops can be a good money maker.
---
 strat live runs, opening up UBRS / scholo / stratholme backdoor. Enchanting on top of that to get some shards. 
---
Reserving dark iron in BRD jailbreaks etc.
---
Even if you don’t want to be a tank you can take advantage of being the most viable tanking class, if you raid grab a few castoffs once the tanks are geared and fury tank those instances.
---
For me, absolutely. For you? Maybe, maybe not. It’s not a great class if you want to be recognized for your accomplishments. No judgement. There are plenty of classes that are easy to pick up and do well. Druid mostly isn’t one.
---
I doubt that.
---
Taurens can only ride kodos I think. And the rare undead horse drop.
---
i need a guide. i do almost all quests and still on lvl 30 i get nothing to do, no quests. hope guides can help me...
---
Wyvern is an awful spell. You need to be out of combat to use it, which often means having to feign -&gt; no FD trap, the dot afterwards does 600 damage which is shite because it shares with viper or serpent sting which means it's only like a 20% dps increase from just using a serpent sting. There's so much better options to get like intimidation + scatter, that's 2 big CC's or scatter + deep survival for all the other survival things but with scatter which is way way way better than wyvern sting will ever be.
---
You are so deluded in thinking that there is any way this game will succeed in the 2019 ecosystem that it's really sad. Can't wait for the game to actually come out so people can get a reality check and realize how disconnected they are from reality.
---
Shadowmeld.
---
You are correct here.
---
Hoo-yeah!
---
I think tank pulling when the healer is oom is much more of a noob move than healer going oom but still keeping everyone alive. I think everyone's used to everyone being way overgeared with enchanted heirlooms and have forgotten how much more fun being challenged is than "doing 10 minutes of content."
---
That is true.
---
5% more HP doesn't do much. 5% of other things can do a lot, it depends on what you're talking about.
---
5% more crit is a lot more threat, 5% more hit is a lot more threat etc. 
---
Why is my point invalid? The only time that extra 5% HP is going to benefit you as a tauren warrior is if your health dips below 5% HP. Thats it, the rest of the time it's a dead racial that does literally nothing
---
I agree, but full stealth would be kinda OP.
---
For pve no. You really shouldn't run out of mana and the 5% int is such a small part of your mana pull and crit chance. 
---
For pvp though the escape artist is of course amazing.
---
Less than that really. On my AQ geared mage it gave me less than half a crit and I would never have mana issues.
---
That or Windfury for single target threat.
---
Ren and Stimpy lol..
---
Similar reason; well i do have MMO experience but i will be playing WoW for the first time ever! I am on the hype train and for the longest time i have been craving a standard "dungeons and raids with tanks and mages" style MMORPG and every single MMO thats been released has dissapointed me in one way or another. I can't wait to dive into this game once and for all.
---
It's more about what is normal in RDF now.  If someone is a really bad healer, people will not be happy that person queued up as a healer.   
---
I agree challenging content can be fun, but this is the healer wasting the time of 4 other people who never agreed to run a dungeon very slowly with a healer who is completely new to the game.
---
\#nochanges clowns are hilariously pathetic. For multiple reasons, but I won't waste time typing it out to one.
---
Its a good argument.  A bit niche, but overall i have no issue with people taking more paladins as they are great healers anyway. Not  sure how required that 5th is.
---
Yes, but in Classic, most people will not -get- that immediately, because it's a rare drop, which provides that secondary item with value in the mean-time.
---
Yep, i'm ok with all of that (assuming no fixes, who knows) as an alternative to being stuck on a simple quest for an hour. 
---
And im in the majority. Get used to it.
---
is this a parody post?
---
Night Elf I guess because They're the closest thematically to the Draenei. Ancient beings that fight the burning legion and... ancient elves that protect nature and fight the burning legion... plus they both worship Naaru *wink wink*.
---
Joanas mechanics were always complete trash tier, but his guides were so damn amazing, and he made a lot of money of it. Him using the guides to get speedrun records probably helped a lot with selling it, probably the only reason he actually did the speedruns tbh.
---
Let's face it: Bone Reaver's Edge may be Best In Slot:
---
But most people in Vanilla would be jumping with joy if they got a Spinal Reaper.
---
It’ll change in-game. A lot of reddit is a cesspool of elitists man children, they’ll be drowned out by all the helpful people when the game is out.
---
oh
---
Get questie and an area lvl guide. There are a TON of areas for that lvl zone.
---
Hillsbrad, Arathi, STV, Thousand needles (mostly horde), swamp of sorrows (horde again), dustwallow marsh (alliance)
---
anything that sounds just a wee bit overpowered you can't remove. 
---
It just removes magical buffs, like shields stat buffs, HoT's and such.
---
Touche.
---
I look forward to farming whelps for a chance at a pet. I look forward to grinding some good ol’ felcloth. I look forward to the nostalgia of entering an AV match. I look forward to the permanence of my actions, because classic WoW will never go anywhere. There won’t be another expansion to make my gear obsolete. It will be freeing, knowing I don’t have to rush things. I can log in 1-5 hours a week and know that there will be others who can only devote small increments of time as well. I look forward to making new memories and playing with my family
---
The great story about my tank friend is this pic was from before we formally met. I was pugging a run with this guild. In BC, him and I independently switched and joined the same guild. Years later I noticed this old pic had him front and center.
---
u/grandpasweater just got owned.
---
/thread
---
I’m on board with this. Party v party without any incentive or organization by blizz. Purely for amusement
---
So I've done the warrior grind in vanilla and private servers. Raided a bit in vanilla but switched servers and played a shaman after that, never saw organized bgs or anything beyond MC on the warrior. Part of the reason I want to get back to it. On the private server I got to 59 and stopped playing to wait for classic. 
---
The grind really isnt so bad, as long as you spend a little more time with cooking and even fishing. I used mining mats and had guildies craft weapon stones and gear while leveling, and got engineering up for the big iron nades. Do a few extra instance runs for gear, stay a level or two above your questing zone, and keep your weapon updated. Even without heals, it's not crazy. Just gotta think about your pulls, practice caution, and group up with others whenever you get the chance. 
---
And I'm still not completely convinced I'll roll one again. But that rank 10 pvp set + TuF are calling my name....
---
Bears aren't good offtanks because of crushing blows but rather in spite of it. If they didn't get crushed they would be viable main tanks.
---
I think lots of us that rolled hybrids hoping to do whatever role we found fun are still a little bitter at being forced into a role. But that's really how vanilla was. In raids you needed good dps and good heals, but hybrids are only capable of one of those things.
---
Jesus, how many bubbles does a Paladin need?
---
Well you can either do it the second week or you can shift your diurnal rhythm so that you play when other people sleep!
---
&gt; because they are in Barrens chat yelling what they think they should be yelling in chat just to get a laugh
---
Barrens chat had already become that after the first wave of people leveling. eg. Chuck Norris jokes (my god I miss them, some legit made me laugh so hard I would walk off the path and pull aggro)
---
&gt;Also BoP non-guild there is no "main spec before offspec", if it is an item that you can use that you want, then you roll on it.
---
My foot there isn't, feral druid don't get to N all the cloth gear. Or visa versa. Unless that person says at the outset i am am rolling for x type of gear.
---
I’ve heard about an instant 60 pserver you could mess around on. Also there is a stress test in two weeks
---
Unfortunately this is true.
---
Gurubashi arena was designed with that exact idea in mind.
---
I like the story. But if every cut scene and story basically ignores you. You who did the work. You who spent 50 hours on a single raid. Then stop pretending the hero is you. Stop pretending the story is about your character. Modern wow feels like a book that I need to go to the gym for an hour to turn the page. Classic story was vague but at least it didn't pretend I was important then kick me out of the cut scene for the 'real' hero's . Let me make my own story with the main quests giving a general over view. I can fill in the blanks from there.  .if modern wow wrote it's stories based on the game it would be. Varian stood at the gates of the ice crown citidel untill 50 of his mates kicked the crap out of Arthus. He then shooed them away so he could deliver the final blow and talk as if he actually helped. Rivitting stuff!
---
Layering =/= Sharding, but what did I expect from another redditard?
---
But the N buttons is easy to push as the G one... And far more effective for gather gold value :P
---
I played a holy paladin pre TBC and loved it and this time I might try to play ret and see how far I get. NIGHTFALL will probably be the weapon of choice for raids unfortunately until I out roll the arms warriors :P
---
&gt; and those lowbies kill him, and he gets away without consequence
---
How so?  Rezzing and fucking off flying away?  This happened in Vanilla as well, because the 60 had an epic mount and can easily outrun any lowbies he managed to die to previously.
---
Don't sit here and pretend this is purely a flying mount thing.
---
I did level a tauren druid late in vanilla, but I admit that I never raided with it beyond alt runs, and only as resto.  
---
Most of my comments are based off my memory of playing with a very good pvp orientated feral druid that we let raid as feral as he was overall one of the best players on our server.  I am conflating certain things, for example I don't specifically remember how big the DPS gap was in early raids as I mostly played healer and didn't run a meter.  I do remember that I could bring in my alt mage in mostly blues to ZG and slaughter him in rank 13 gear and a mixmatch of gear from BWL/MC.  
---
Part of the issue is that MC, BWL, and ZG progression occurred pre 1.8 patch, where feral was in an even worse spot.  Power shifting talents were spread across 3 trees in such a way that you couldn't get them all.  IIRC you were globaled on shifting so you couldn't immediately use the energy, and could only power shift 1/2 the speed that you can in 1.12.  Also the 10% melee damage talent from balance was too deep to get with a full feral build.  There was no heart of the wild and there was no crit aura yet.  Anyone who tells you that feral did good in early raids frankly is basing that 100% on private servers and not vanilla.  
---
It maybe got a bit better with the druid patch and early AQ, but by near end of AQ or into early naxx, was when our guild really started to learn about theorycrafting, elitist jerks forums etc.  Mages all went fire, people learned to use stopcasting macros, and our melee all started wearing +weapon skill.  I'm sure there were people ahead of us with this knowledge, we just had got that far without a lot of it.
---
When dps classes started cleaning up their play and really minmaxing, our druid got 100% run out of playing feral as dps.  We would have let him continue to play it, but he was so upset by it that he specced HOTW build, offtanked trash and healed every boss.
---
Isn't Crossroads a Horde Zone? I feel like the Alliance Equivalent would be Sentinel Hill in Westfall, no?
---
That’s the top one percent, you can’t extrapolate that to the whole streamer population. For every soda/asmong there are 1000 no names. 
---
Look, enjoy it while they can, it’s the same thing as an athlete, people love you but they will forget you once somebody new/younger comes along.
---
Divine Shield and Divine Protection are mutually exclusive, they share a 5 minute cooldown. You typically do not use the one once you get the other because Divine Shield lets you attack at 50% speed while Divine Protection does not allow offensive use.
---
Divine Intervention kills the paladin who uses it so its not like you need to worry about them after its been used.
---
BECAUSE WE FOUND MUL'GORE SPICED BREAD ON GNOLLS IN WESTFALL, AND WE KNOW SHE'S IN ON IT!! &gt;:(
---
So, rolling need on an upgrade now its ninja looting if somebody else might also want it but they don't want it. ok
---
I really can't wrap my head around the appeal. It all seems so charmless
---
Blizzard's greatest strength was always their art team, but even a whole decade later I'm still swept away by how Pre-Cata WoW looks. Something seems utterly captivating about it, but it really is so indescribably difficult to explain. Teldrassil in particular. 
---
Maybe in the end of the day, it truly is just the sheer power of nostalgia?
---
Spell-Batching and Leeway are in the same bucket as enforcing 5:4 aspect ratio.
---
Hunters don't need HoJ its not much of an upgrade in dps. All i have learned from this is to NEVER bring a hunter to BRD.
---
I enjoy calling out hypocrites on their hypocrisy.
---
Some humorous jabs at each class based on common stereotypes &amp; critiques, in a high speed format. Also usable as the most pessimistic class picking guide ever. Hope some of ya'll find it entertaining.
---
cuz the characters in the comic look like the characters in the show and its the exact same series of events?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Crushing_blow
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Uncrushability
---
Basically because the raid boss is considered 3 levels higher its like fighting mobs that are above your level so you miss more often and there is a chance for the boss to do 150% damage. if you cant take crushing blows its really just a matter of time until the boss gets two in a row and you die.
---
Retadin it is, then.
---
as opposed to inaudibly laughing?
---
Lotta people play while eating, or doing something else, too. If I'm raiding I'm not gonna be keyboard turning, but doing regular stupid shit that doesn't matter? Catch me keyboard turning while my cat lays across my arm making it go numb.
---
Also, I play with a moderate physical disability and click some spells because for me it's faster/easier. I might not be as good a player as someone who has 27 mouse buttons bound, but I'm good enough for your average raid group.
---
&gt;Obviously you can replicate the same thing in Gurubashi Arena, but that's a lot of effort for people that no one bothers with (Based on my experience on Beta and private servers).
---
&gt;It's not "selfish" if the item is equally BiS for everyone.
---
But its not equally BIS. For some classes its Bis for a long time and adds a ton of extra damage. For hunters it hardly add any benefit and is easily replaced.
---
This isn't equal BIS.
---
Often the off tank takes adds that spawn and help with trash, all of which are lower level than the ?? bosses, which is very manageable to not be crushed by.
---
But that's obviously not what makes them good. They're amazing because they can go bear, pick up the adds or whatever, then with the exact same gear and spec, switch into cat and do average dps on the boss. It's really flexible.
---
Doesn't paladin have a bubble to use on allies that doesn't self kill? Or is that not till TBC?
---
Raiders will always be as powerful or moreso than PvPers. All the best pvpers will raid as well. The amount of gear that's available to people who strictly PvP is incredibly limited, even if the epic pieces are pretty good for PvP.
---
T2 pally is spell powerf?
---
Sooooooo.... why not just make them do the old content, when the new content comes out, if they didn't see it before, and now there are both people to carry them, and a little catch-up dungeon to help them get some of the items so that they can actually -do- the old content now?
---
\&gt;Are either, both, or neither working in the Classic Beta as you would like?
---
Yes.
---
\&gt;If yes, why? If no, why not?
---
It plays like it did.
---
\&gt;How could the current implementation of either be modified to improve their behavior?
---
By Being left alone.
---
\&gt;Are the current implementations authentic to Vanilla (or "the Vanilla experience")?
---
The third tank (off) will probably be a feral druid.
---
Aside from the hardcore guilds, many will have trouble filling 40 slots every week. 
---
The hardcore guilds will most likely not include hybrid classes as their members will be minmaxing. 
---
Most likely these new players you are referring to will not be in these hardcore guilds either. If they, or planning to be, they are probably researching and already know what they will be minmaxing. 
---
So again, the New comers that plan on being casual/semi casual raiders are probably not going to have as big a problem finding raids as you're making it out to be. In vanilla we cleared some 40 man stuff filling with people not even at 60 due to last minute adds.
---
Heh, I do both.  Let them die then when we back in the instance I'm trickle healing the tank until he gets mad and talks shit :D
---
I actually liked healing group content more than DPSing in vanilla, but healers have a horrible time doing anything solo. I didnt want to continue wanding mobs down one at a time to farm gold for an epic mount, and respeccs are expensive.
---
You can join a farming party, however. I feel it's important to have a guild you enjoy being part of if you're going to main a healer.
---
No, because warriors also do great dps. Hybrid dps is trash and guilds need healers.
---
Fuck i love tanking. I just hate tanking for other people.
---
Imply whatever makes you feel better, I'm sick of being told I shouldn't level fast by retards who haven't played vanilla/pservers that don't understand leveling is straight up boring and not new so just because we don't like taking 2 months to hit 60, we aren't playing the game correctly.
---
Retail is removing the way people have fun, if people want to tell others how to have fun, they can fuck off back to retail
---
That's Blessing of Protection, its a magic spell and can be purged. It protects against physical attacks only &amp; prevents the blessed person from using physical attacks while active. Can still spell cast though.
---
Which is crazy because literally everything else about Wrath was easy as piss
---
That laugh was so fake
---
That's Blessing of Protection and only protects against physical attacks for 10 seconds and can be purged.
---
You needed every class.
---
Just like doing a dungeon or a raid. You need to physically get there. The best part of Classic was the idea of having an open playground to do whatever you wanted. Blizz provided the tools, players created the experience.
---
