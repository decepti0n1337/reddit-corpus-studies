Make shadowmeld last for 10 seconds once you move. Wouldn’t be too overpowered and would make things more interesting.
---
MT should be the guy on most, running people through attunements and getting pre raid gear, even when he is long done with it.
---
I did it in TBC and let me tell you, there arent enough hours in the day.
---
I wouldn’t let you heal BRD with that spec, forget raiding.
---
If I were you I'd level a hunter alt on rested exp in the background. Takes no time at all to pop in, use up the rested, and pop back out. I'd consider leveling that hunter to 20 first before you start the rested exp hopping.  
---
By the time the hunter is 60, we might be doing BWL, and as you start approaching harder raids your gold cost is going to increase, so having the hunter to farm will be useful for those last three raid buckets.

[Bold Snap](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235219/cold-snap) - Here's my epic staff! -"*Looks more like a wand to me*"
---
In BFA when you queue for a BG while leveling its become a dice roll for how many twinks are on each team. Sucks when you're not one of them
---
Yeah that's true. 
---
A question for people saying you should do quests when they are level appropriate.
---
I was under the impression that rep is level invariant, i.e. if the quest is grey yes the exp is nerfed but rep reward is still the same? 
---
&gt; How has your experience been?  
---
Mostly just me annoying my friends and family about it because they don't care  
---
&gt; Are your friends hyped?  
---
I have no friends who played Classic WoW  
---
&gt; Are they on the fence?  
---
One friend is interested in starting, but his first child's due date is basically Classic's release date. So that'll be a likely no.  
---
&gt; What's the reaction of your... SO?  
---
We ended our 5 year relationship 6 months or so ago, and I can't lie living alone again is really enjoyable, and I fully plan on going complete no-life during Classic.

---
It’s unrelated to wow, but still lol
---
I missed the first two weeks thanks to life and people keep saying things like this... I didnt miss the first two weeks of WoD however! :(
---
Main tank makes or breaks your raid guild. In 90% of scenarios your MT should either be the guild leader or closely related to the guild leader via IRL. Why? Well if you lose your MT after investing 9 months of bis loot into them your guild dies overnight.
---
All of your dps is limited by the threat of your main tank so it is extremely important they're the first person to get all the best gear. This means it's extremely important they never miss a raid. This also means they must always have full consumables at all times. If your dps has to hold damage because you're too lazy to farm consumables they're gonna be mad. Make too many good dps mad and they will leave for a guild with a tank who will let them go ham and have fun and you will be out a good dpser.
---
All of this consumable farming and raiding alone is enough to play a full 40+ hours a week. Then you factor in dungeon runs and helping out the guild. It's not an easy job and definitely isn't for everyone.
---
Me and my guild were doing the mythic dungeons at like 280 ilvl and having to work out the mechanics as we went.
---
Was a lot of fun. 
---
This was always my pet leveling go-to.. usually I'd join guild runs or trade chat groups and let them know I was leveling a new pet but would pull my weight with DPS and utility.
---
Cost is an irrelevant wall for a lot of people (unless you make it something absurd like $100), even if it was $50 people would server hop until they found one with favourable conditions or to rid themselves of a bad name which isn't the idea of restrictions. You're supposed to be stuck/attached to your server/the servers community whether that's positive or negative. Free server migration is always to try help server health as a whole, not individuals. Paid transfer is because they accept that sometimes there really are good reasons to move, maybe they haven't done enough to fix population imbalances or perhaps you've got a new real friend and you both want to play on the same server. These things shouldn't happen too often and there's always the option of rerolling.
---
Thumbs up for Strong Bad.
---
As someone who never raised or even played in vanilla, I prefer to not know the encounters. If I can do mythic legion bullshit then I can listen to directions from an RL for these fights.  
---
  
---
The TL;DR works great for me, I prefer to keep the experience fresh no matter what
---
Started mid TBC back when I was 7 years old. My dad was introduced by the South Park episode, a re run. Here we are present day, I am still playing. But I'm excited to play Classic alongside Retail! They're too different to make the direct comparisons people keep trying to make, I love em both.
---

---
Assuming there's no limit on classic you can be as slow as your guild allows. If you want it in a reasonable timeframe (~1 year) and you don't have a guild pre-planned you should probably expect to be playing 40-50+ hours a week at least. Naxx and Thunderfury are the real hurdles because Naxx is genuinely only for serious guilds and Thunderfury is extremely rare and will only go to the most active/reliable players.
---
I recommend giving it a good try to 120 and gear up enough to check out the warfronts at 320 ilvl. Past that you decide for yourself if it's your cup of tea. Uldir is the current raid, and oh boy the final boss is wonderfully difficult. (plz don't judge the raid on Raid Finder difficulty, do try it though)
---
Lets see... Ive made extremely detailed plans for leveling, professions, items, talents in my gaming notebook (yes... Im old). I have talked to every single WoW friend from the last few p servers and have a rough idea of what everyone is gonna play. Most of them are hyped, but Im usually the one having to organize the guild and most of them are playing pubg. I have gotten to the point where I simply dont want to think about it at all, because theres nothing left for me to plan out or get hyped about. 
---
I do understand this but having previously been the raid leader I would be infuriated!!
---
Quel serrar is a hilarious meme weapon. It is so bad. In 90% of scenarios your threat is more important than damage mitigation and there are so many better weapons. We would pretty much buy these for the noobs new tanks who couldn't be assed to farm better weapons. You never want to see this on your MT.
---
Holy cow I hit 30 at the same time!! At felfire hill in Ashenvale, good times
---
I plan to move in with my girlfriend in July, I also am working towards getting a much better job in a adjacent state for that move. So I have been studying alot and preparing any possible research for classic I may need beforehand. I feel like my life is going to be way more awesome come july/august, I can't wait. Also trying to get her to play with me.   
---
More excited to live with her everyday tho, experiencing vanilla like I never got to in the past sounds so dope.
---
I don't mind looking up a fight of the raid night, however I still want to have the scenery and the boss be fresh. I pick up fights pretty fast personally.
---
Iv seen his work, he hasnt made anything new in a while
---
You don't even need to have 1 name list.  Say you have 60 servers.  You've got 12 server groups.  Keep a unique name list for each server group.  1 server drops too low on daily pop?  Merge it into the next lowest in the server group.  The likelihood of all 5 servers being ghosted so hard that you can't maintain a single active server out of them is acceptably low.  Skip the feelsbadman of name changes, eliminates the need for free server migration, introduces a minimum of intrusion to communities.  Yeah, if things get slow, you might merge into another server, but then, you've only got to learn new guilds and new players once, and that process will go quick since new people you meet will know all of the other new people on your server.  You make friends with someone that merged in and they say "don't group with that guy, he's an asshat", you know.  Ninjas can't transfer to a hidey hole.
---
Then start your own and make it a good one.
---
Warriors have the highest hp regen per spirit though, and sub level 30 or so spirit is highly beneficial
---
I started in 2006 after seeing the Leeroy video.  I was fresh out of college with a full time job and a lot of free time after work.  I left during cataclysm, and never came back after that because they ruined the talent system.
---
&gt;I sure hope they do some balance changes.
---
Just fyi, as it stands right now there will not be balance changes. Blizzard said on blizzcon that they will not under any circumstance rebalance classes or change the 1.12 data in any way, as they said "it's not ours to change" and "it's holy". I'm not arguing against you btw, just informing in case you aren't aware.

Hunter: 
---
- training new animals to get their abilities and getting higher rank abilties
---
- keeping your pet fed and happy with the correct food
---
- keeping and upgrading an ammo pouch with the correct type of ammo
---
- uses Mana
---
- dead zone
---
- no melee spec, if you don't like being ranged you'll greatly hinder your dps
---
Rogue:
---
 - crafting your own poisons
---
- needing reagents for abilities, some from vendors some from herbalism
---
- thistle tea from cooking
---
- grinding lock picking 
---
- no gun finisher, cannonballs, or dice if you are trying for a piratey playstyle 
---
You should still like the same class, some of the specs are different and there is just a bit more fantasy work involved

It would make more sense for it to be +10 spirit.
---
Ok, then have fun never playing in battlegrounds for fun.
---
popular streamers + their fanbois will cause huge population imbalances
---
So leveling multiple pets just for sake of "having them" was a no-go back then?
---
Cloth is expensive. Speaking as someone who was Exalted with all four who turned in cloth to make that happen. Runecloth is incredibly valuable, especially on a fresh server. 
---
Wow that was a whole bunch of rage built into one post.  It’s okay friend I would have that much anger if I were Romanian too, you’re sort of setup to fail. 
---
For your next internet debate that you obviously will get in here in couple minutes, try to at least get this aggro only when you’re correct.  When you’re wrong and go into a rage like this it’s sort of awkward.  But you’re Romanian so we both know that’s not going to happen.  Have fun! 
---
MT goes to 1 out of every 40+ raiders, and is a position competed amongst the most abundant class in the game (granted not every warrior wants to tank). You will be the first to get gear in your raid. You'll be the first to get called to help tank for the guild outside of raids. There WILL be people with huge MT aspirations that will dedicate a ton of time to making it happen. So don't expect to MT when you're putting in significantly less time than 2-3 other warriors in your guild. As mentioned, your best bet if play time isn't on your side is starting your own guild or being really good friends with a GM who will give you chances over others who are putting in more time than you. And stay very active and social and make a lot of friends in the guild who will back you up as MT, like every hour you're logged in should be socializing and being a good guild mate if you're putting in 20 hours and someone else is putting in 40
---
There’s a lot of great videos in here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7qjmd1/hunter_pvp_video_thread/?st=JQVMD0CG&amp;sh=ef7b34da
---
Stop with the aids clickbait title. Instant downvote, won't watch
---
you seem to be stuck with rage, romanian and wrong. 
---
i would suggest a reboot but we all know its the extra chromosomes that are doing all the work here.
---
don't worry about me having fun :)
---
I didn’t make the video.
---
I just posted the link and the title took the title of the video.
---
My marriage is on the rocks so I’ve bribed the wife to go out of state for two weeks expenses paid to stay with her family so she can go to the beach etc.
---
In eachange I get a week of wow where I can take time off no issues.
---
As for the hyping it’s had a massive issue, I’m constantly looking for updates about the game (I really want to know if DM is at launch as it came out 3 months after release originally) and so it’s like 180 days of me being miserable and then dreading the thoughts of delays.
---
I have a team of 5 mates from Australia wanting to go all out on launch so it’s been a good experience having the idea of friends to finally play a good game with.
---
Right now I’ve been bored as hell at home, no game is filling that hole in my heart that wow left. I did 1-18 on a private server to get the hang of warrior but I don’t want to burn out so I put it down.
---
&gt; you seem to be stuck with rage, romanian and wrong.
---
If you weren’t these things/doing these things I wouldn’t be.  Yet here we are.

Traque is best vanilla hunter :) https://youtu.be/Cx4nDj5PQbs
---
In pvp you'll want to learn how to 'stance dance' to be there most effective.
---
This might be apparent, but you usually can't go toe to toe with another class without changing forms for roots, heals, dots, or escaping. 
---
Sneaky groups were so fun, there was even a guild in vanilla called &lt;leathergear solid&gt; and they only had druids and rogues 
---
None of my friends care and I'm currently probably just gonna solo level untl 60. Would love to have a SO to play with but no luck thus far.
---
On private servers with 10k pop I was able to easily corner the market early in the servers life cycle. Sometimes its filled to the brim others its completely dead.
---
Remember classic servers will probably have half the population of private servers AND they will be in your timezone. Both will help immensely with farming /gold making
---
Amen.
---
nah, just your down syndrome, stop fooling yourself
---
Then why did you post it
---
It’s funny because all your insults are just made up nonsense that don’t actually have any weight behind them.  But the ones I have are actually critiques of your character.  I think I’ll just leave it at this, I’m actually embarrassed that I have someone like you this much of my time.  
---
Why else do people post videos?
---
Its so it gets some visibility. I didnt even really know about this till I watched the video and figured other people would like the information aswell.
---
Tim the Tatman is wears his hat backwards which prevents there from being an obstruction of his eyes, you could always do that as well.
---
There probably isnt a lot of reason to do AH guessing because who knows what things are worth, but if you had the barebones minimum like how many boar anuses stack up to and what they vendor for and show a few of the drops, that should suffice.
---
You can get kicked from raids and guilds for that. You can easily wipe a raid. Most of the RLs I had would never take the time to explain a whole fight. 
---
Got 2 mates ready to go as well, just all kind of ready for more details/news tbh.  
---
My guild is mostly migrating over to classic from retail, even thought I won't be joining it.  
---
AND, I have my SO good to go, as long as I can make it believable that cats can dps well.
---
Then you have poor leadership. I took my guild to AQ40 as a RL on a server with 100% increased boss HP.
---
Hi Raserisk,
---
On a different note, I really enjoyed the video and thought it covered everything in a really well thought out and concise manner. I also really liked how everything was laid out, what the icons looked like, the production quality, etc.
---
It might be helpful to show some maps of the area as well to let people know what to expect around the boss, but all in all there really wasn't anything I would change. Maybe slow down a teeny bit? Can't say much more than that. 
---
Keep up the good work. 
---
Two druids. Two friggin druids...
---
I'll research it before the raid if needed, I personally prefer to keep the scenery fresh as much as I can, not trying to go super hardcore
---
The TL;DR is how you translate the wall of text that is the boss fight into something palpable that can be repeated in someone's mind while the fight goes on. It's how you lead properly IMO.. or at least it's how I intend to lead my raids.
---
Yeah that pretty much sums up my thoughts! MC was designed for new players new to MMORPGs and raiding in general - in fact the entire raid dungeon was made in the span of a week apparently! We'll keep the Boss Guides coming for both the easy and hard fights because it's all a matter of perspective!
---
I've always assumed this, but never tested it.
---
Classic.wowhead claims : 'You get a 10% discount starting at Honored for buying items, item repair, training costs, and taxi flights.'
---
"not by today's standards" that's the key though, there's no point comparing 
---
to games like everquest, that's just way too old. Clearly when I say hard I'm referring to "hard" in relation to TODAY's standards (where pretty much every game is a handholding faceroll". I don't claim that Classic WoW is the pinnacle of difficulty, just that retail has been trashed so badly that classic starts to look pretty damn good right about now!
---
Not a no-go, but you had to invest time. Brokentooth is a good all rounder, high attack speed for buff uptime and also interrupts in PvP.
---
Yeah? Innervate and battle res bots. That's all you need.  
---
I loved that in Legion so I bet it was amazing
---
Yeah I missed it in legion. Really tarnished my enjoyment of the expac as a whole. 
---
This is a really strong build. I'm not sure how valuable natural shapeshifter would be if you aren't really going to be shifting that often though. You could probably swap it out for guaranteed roots, or even improved thorns. Otherwise, pretty nice.
---
Also I think someone else said it somewhere, but including the loot window on the boss is a plus. I always like seeing what dropped no matter what boss is being killed. Hope you do that for the entire guide.  
---
Fear Wart - Target gets a nasty looking wart on their face which multiplies threat generation by 1.2

It's a interesting thing! Not quite sure why people like it but shouldn't be a problem lol!
---
nooo, plz dont go, how can i ever recover from this?!
---
yes, your rhetoric was unbelievably smart while mine was dumb because... onions.
---
those weren't insult, i was just describing you. you need some truth in life between all those lols. 
---
u sad shit :)
---
Earlyish 2005 when it came out in Europe. I stopped playing for good after the first month in Cataclysm. Back then I thought I would like the changes to Azeroth, but I was wrong, it's like I lost a part of myself. After that, being hyped for Classic, I tried BfA, bought two months of subscription and I only played he 4 first weeks and then I gave up. The current version of the game is appalling. It does have some good of course, it is not all bad, but compared to Vanilla or even Wrath, it is shocking.
---
&gt;Are your friends hyped?
---
&gt;Are they on the fence?
---
Feelings are mixed. Two of us are excited, two are planning to play but aren't gushing over it. One has completely dismissed it and won't be playing. One hasn't said anything, even when asked.
---
I'm one of the two who's excited, but recent news from Blizzard dampened my enthusiasm a bit. I'm not as confident that they'll handle it well as I was a year ago.
---
For a while there was some contention over which faction to play. Of the four planning to play, who is absolutely dead set on horde, and one is absolutely dead set on alliance. And of the two on the fence, again, one of each leaned towards horde or alliance. But a few months ago the on the fence for horde decided to go alliance, so now it's 3 vs 1, and the one horde player says he'll be happy to fight against us instead of with us.
---
So that's where it stands. *shrug*
---
Yep, that was what happened on bronzebeard. I know it was never a top notch server, but a few of the top raiding guild took advantage of the free transfers and the server was never the same.
---
Is this not heavily dependent on the Instance reset macro? Some other hardcore mages in discord were saying its not certain that on live classic the ResetInstance/Camp macro we are using on private servers will work on live.
---
That would then require suicides on things like the Lasher farms where you cannot readily access the exit the way you can in DM:N after doing the dogs and scarabs. Do you have any plans if thats the case? You seem to really know your stuff so Im kinda trying to pick up some tips, lol.
---
Wrong. They make more from stupid pets, mounts, arena being an unbalanced mess because they buff and nerf classes every patch which = class boosts and race changes. They also make a killing on tokens.
---
Current WoW is a cash cow with minimal work. They make more with 1/10th or less subscribers. That is why they hate us and old WoW. 
---
It could function like flare! I wonder though, how hard would it be to code perception to only reveal the mobs to the caster &amp; not actually remove stealth
---
It's more common than you think, I remember that back in WOTLK, a lot of my guild members who lived in Eastern Europe sold of their kids when new expansions came and adopted new ones during content gaps.
---
Cant forget the boar anuses lmfao
---
I understand your point. Newer guilds doing things with inexperienced players should, and need to, go over it. I was rarely RL and would just delegate to our class/ position leaders to make sure everyone knew the fight beforehand, just go a separate vent channel. 
---
By knowing the basic fight mechanic I don't think it takes away the fun of the first time. 
---
But I'm an idiot, just play it like you want. WoW is amazing
---
You are not very good at math/statistics, are you? 1% is 1%.
---
Wait that doesn't even make sense. So if you've only done normal the entire tier, if it wasn't for catch-up mechanics you wouldn't have good enough gear to continue doing normal?
---
Why TBC and not Wrath then, so you can top the meters in the best iteration of Ret.
---
Either Alliance or Undead. I am undecided.
---
And then they ruined it starting with the 340 bukkake from warfronts. Blizzard pissing on my progress have never felt as apparent as it did then.
---
If it saves time and effort for both parties, is it really hard to imagine why some people are defending it?
---
Rogue in world PvP, Hunter in BGs. You will find that in BGs, and especially AV, bring a Rogue can be very painful unless you are playing really well.
---
Battlegrounds que dodging.
---
Premades love it. Casuals, solos, and small groups hate it. 
---
#notall
---
Unpopular opinion: I'm all for a deserter debuff if you leave the que AFTER it pops. If your argument is: but I just went afk to pee then think about the group in the bg you just put in a worse positon by holding a spot during the set up and someone possibly filling at after it starts, putting your faction at a disadvantage. If you have to go afk just drop que, get you stuff done and come back, or be like Cartman and call for Mom.
---
Wouldn’t mind a guide to setting up Grid/Clique to have the same set up as yours. I have yet to be able to figure it out. Do you have a mod list and a link to said mods?
---
You would never be able to make anything worthwhile on your own/with a small amateur team anyway so don't fret it. Making a game is a huge undertaking.
---
I honestly haven't spoken with them about it. I can probably drag my room mate in with me. We played Arena Duos for a little bit together. 
---
fyi its spelled solely not souly. and you're 100% right, always better to explain parts of the fight unless its your core bros. you never know what other people are unaware of and its not worth wiping.
---
You can do them all in any role at 56-57ish. Only exceptions I can think of is beginning of strath with a low level tank but even then a good mage and healer can carry that. 
---
Works well to AQ in nerfed 1.12 content. The actual good Elemental set is in AQ, so it's going to be expensive at one point.
---
This would be the spec. It does NOT heal 5 mans all that great because of long cast time on healing wave so farm pre raid before this. It works in raids in a melee group because mana tide isn't needed and with chain heal it's fine. You would rather have 2 points more in totem mana reduction for PvP, but in PVE Ancestral Healing is simply too big a deal.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcIz0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcIz0xo)
---
WoW Classic tier 1 and 2 is severely dumbed down and nerfed just from 1.12 talents and heals landing instantly with spellbatching gone. With all the other nerfs to early raiding on top of that like wrong itemization, 16 debuffs, Diremaul loot, Tier 1 and 2 is going to be an absolute joke and puggable. If it goes live with all the bad decisions Ion has made? You won't even need a guild until AQ. The few hardcore guilds there will be, will run with half the numbers in two runs and melee trains, where shamans are huge and you STILL might get away with it..
---
**Anyone telling you that you need to be full resto in these dumbed down, timewalking, fake raiding content that will be in Classic is delusional and simply doesn't know what they are talking about. You are going to have a stupid amount of melee groups due to how OP Warriors are in 1.12 anyways and windfury totem makes the world go round.**
---
Most of the people telling you that you need mana tide never even raided current content or have no idea how game changing 1.12 is with raid dps/threat, which dumbs down healing. They are just bad content creators or listen to them as if they are gospel. Basically save money for AQ where you get baller gear. Weapon is not as important as you think on Shaman because some prefer fast (which you can get in ZG) with searing totem vs other casters over just more spelldmg. Naxx is optional. It's going to be 100 percent as hard as real Vanilla Naxx, which means stupidly expensive and time consuming. If you are raiding Naxx you don't need to ask about respeccing. You are 100 percent going to do it, farm an insane amount of consumables and or buy gold or tokens if they have them in the game. That's why when people clear Naxx a couple times on private they are done. 
---
Guilds like Nihilum had people farming 24/7 outside the raid. Very few guilds could find 40 people that dedicated or 40 people willing to cheat with gold buying or that had a mage/hunter alt to farm gold. Naxx clears are still going to be rare in Classic.
---
You pay for it, that why it isn't. Blizzard wants your money.
---
Painful topic. Only a handful of very close friends know I’m playing WoW (again). I just started a new job for a very prestigious  company, that was very difficult to get. I often worry that my coworkers would assume I spend my time playing instead of skilling up. Many of them respond to emails well outside of business hours, it’s kind of expected of you. 
---
When I played 12 years ago, there was this basement dwellers stigma around the game. A lot of it was based on that South Park episode, I think. I remember regretting talking about it to most people. I can only talk about it to other players. 
---
My coworkers would openly talk about playing Warcraft 3 though!
---
And then you fight the counter-raid of fanboys, suddenly making the streamer an effective world PvP boss.
---
I’m jealous of couples play together! They always seem happier than those who just share a household, they have a major thing in common and spend more time together. 
---
I’m in Australia too (35, f, Sydney). May I ask what pserver you guys are on, and are there people online during AEDT hours? 
---
Thanks. 
---
You're a person who has cleared every raid multiple times on multiple characters, so I doubt you'd understand.  
---
I'm a person who hasn't raided in a serious way since ICC in Wrath. The last time I regularly saw a boss loot window was over 8 years ago.  
---
It's just a piece of nostalgia we miss.  
---
Below 55? 
---
Late vanilla till Cata. I quit when they introduced the pandas. Glad they’re not a lore focus anymore. 
---
I reactivated 4 months ago, and caught up on four missed expansions. Legion was fantastic. 
---
I get that. It makes the experience for everyone around the multiboxer worse though, which might be the straw that breaks the camels back for some people. All in all id say its debatable whether it makes sense financially to allow it.
---
I'd honestly be surprised if a boss required more than 3 minutes of concise explanation in classic (bar a handful of exceptions). 
---
I think my explanations in TBC were never more than 2 minutes, until we reached Kael!
---
Raid leader in TBC here... had one of our shamans ask "What's DBM?" during Illidan progression.
---
Theres a ton of gold farming spots like this though. If its not DMN its DMEast, if its not DME its Hunter Tribute runs, if its not Tribute runs its Mage BRD runs, if its not BRD runs its Mara runs and on and on. They can all be done solo, and they can all net 60+ gold an hour.
---
Trying to nerf them all is like cutting heads off of a Hydra. It wont ever work. People will always find efficient ways to use feign death, tanking pets, pathing, AoE with snares, Absorb shits, Regular AoE and kiting. You would literally have to nerf the classes to change this. Heck some mages 1 pull and AoE down Scarlet Monastery runs and manage to make nearly 70g an hour.
---
Your friends are fart faces 
---
Normal isn’t really raiding, heroic is equal to the normal of old 
---
God I hope they don’t.

Joined in icc patch. Stopped in cata.
---
That’s why there is catch up mechanics 
---
these would have been so useful back in the day
---
I'm sure I'll need some of these when classic comes out. keep em coming
---
And Rhonin is dead
---
That’s funny how you already know how many premades will be playing as if 90% of bgs will be premades.  
---
Well assuming it will be just strictly servers.
---
Let’s say each server holds 10k people.
---
So we got 5k alliance and 5k horde.
---
Let’s say 500 of each faction are playing AV(which is high) let’s say there is 5 teams on each faction with premades and they’re all dodging each other.
---
That’s almost 50% of the players and they are making sure they don’t go against other teams.
---
So you have like an 80% chance of being a solo queue and being paired up against a premade.
---
&gt; But imagine if TBC would have arrived a couple of months later, then we for sure would have had a patch 1.13 back then, and well, I have a hard time believing that that would have changed how we view vanilla today.
---
Here is a fun fact... Burning Crusade was delayed. It was originally slated for winter of 06 with signs pointing to it being November. But came October and they announced they were delaying the game so they could extend the closed beta. They then placed the January dated for release. 
---
So even though it did come a couple months later than intended they didn't release a 1.13.
---
Once again you are assuming there are going to be 200 people queing specifically AV at all times on one server?  So this brings me back to my original statement, that’s funny how you already know how many people will be in a premade... that’s crazy because here I am at a complete loss because I personally have no idea what it’s going to be like.
---
While you’re at it, how long are they having sharding for? 
---
How do you how many won’t? Exactly.
---
It’s speculation and it’s not far fetched to assume this.
---
And sharding has nothing to do with how many people are on a server. Sharding is a zone to zone basis to elevate lag and allow people to level.
---
You only need battle Rez if you let important raiders die. Innevervate can be replaced by just using another Priest instead...
---
Demoralizing Stout
---
Warrior can conjur beer, similar to mages, which can be thrown at enemies and make them sad.
---
It is far fetched to assume this.  Your speculation for 200 people grouping premade av ‘normal’ while you consider 500 people queing regularly as ‘really high’ should be a sign enough that your ‘estimates’ are nothing less than far fetched.
---
You may as well have said “50% of people queing bgs will be in a premade” outright.  Which again, is a really high number to assume it to be a norm.  
---
And the sharding thing you clearly just got whooshed pretty hard 
---
I was giving an example for the sake of the argument there guy.
---
Not sure why you have so much animosity but 👌
---
No animosity man just calling you out on obvious outlandish theories.  Just trying to show you you’re making mountains out of molehills.  That’s all. 
---
Not technically.
---
My example could or could not be true.
---
So we will see, it might never be a problem but it also could, just throwing that out there.
---
My take is a little different then what others have commented on so here's my two cents.
---
I was a tank for my guild on a private server, and got thunderfury. It's true that tanks need to do more than raid log, but how much more depends on how hardcore your guild is too. For repair bills on progression nights, the gbank should be able to kick in some extra gold if you need it. They can also get mats for engineering shield, or fire resist gear, or consumables. If you want to be server first, it's going to be more than 40 hours a week, but if you're more casual really you can lower that down to just a few nights raiding, and maybe 1-2 nights raiding ZG or AQ20. Raiding without wipes will net you a decent chunk of change maybe 20-25 gold a night, and with guild runs of live strat to get some orbs and shards, or DM east jump runs to get arcane crystals and shards, you will not need that much extra help from the gbank. 
---
So really it just depends on how fast and dedicated you are. The more hardcore the guild, the more time you need to put into it. I can attest that if you're in a less hardcore guild, it reduces the amount you need to put into it. 
---
With that said, however, you still need to put in more time than your average dps. You need to know the fights better than anyone, and have the skills to maneuver bosses where they need to be, and handle threat. So it does pay to be at least an officer in the guild.  And being able to pay for your own consumables will greatly reduce the strain of progression raiding on the gbank. Others have said a farming alt will help, which it will. But playing the AH will help just as much if you can do that. 
---
Basically it comes down to how much time you have to put into it. If you are fine with a semi-hardcore guild who may not progress crazy fast. It is much easier to maintain the MT position. Even then though, attendance and performance really matters. Show up to raid and be dependable. 
---
And Thunderfury is a crap shoot. Could get it in 1 week or 100 weeks. But if you're MT, it should be yours.
---
Someone plz send this to Blizzard
---
It for sure could!  But I am just saying assuming 50% of people in a premade at an extended period of time is nothing less than a long shot.  
---
Lucky. I was main tank had 0 help for repairs or consumables and had to get 80% of my thunderfury alone on a server first thunderfury. In addition to paying gold to go to raids. I probably had to play 60-80 hours a week to keep up and it really burned me out
---
Ehhhh people who premade will be playing WAY more than any other randoms.
---
It’s 2019 and people are all about not doing things efficiently so I’d wager premades will be a way bigger deal then it has ever been, especially since the best gear in the game is locked behind ranking up in pvp.
---
Back in 2004, most people played just for the hell of it and now it’s not that way. So don’t be too shocked if you run into way more premades then remembered.
---
Good for players. Bad for developers who want to keep their players addicted.
---
Good point, but at least as a hunter you can stay 30 yards away at all times.  If you're helping pull that's a big iffy point
---
I only had about 30 of the arcanite for my TF, my guild came together real fast and I had it made 2 days after I got the second binding. Each guild is different, and will help out differently. There's no way I would have been able to pull off 80 hours a week, just life in general gets in the way. That's like rank 14 grind time and ain't nobody got time for that.
---
I will probably be questing too, I might pick Mage, 3x Warlock, Pally and just quest like that. Using warlock pets =gg and my guild can probably use them as summoners in the future.
---
Ok please don’t do that whole ‘back in the day they didn’t know better’ stuff.  Back in the day I was in premades that’s mainly all I did.  But now I don’t have time for it so I’ll just solo que when I can.  And I can wager there are a lot more like me.  Casuals will always outnumber people who take the game serious or do things efficiently like this, that’s inevitable.  So you are again making another assumption about something that would really have to go against the grain of the history behind us.  
---
It all start with a mobile game : World of Warceaft Immortal.
---
You buy the game and you play as Chromie. Each chapter cost 3.99$ and at the end, you unlock WoW Vanilla in the Battle.NET.
---
That’s great no ? CEO from Activision told me it is... Don’t you guys have a cellphone ?
---
I'm being cautiously optimistic but I would be lying if I said I wasn't hyped in even the slightest. I have three friends that are for sure going to play it while one is uncertain and a special other that's one of those naysayers that strictly believe Classic will die within 6 months flat and having no content after Naxx will be the final nail in the coffin while he's basking in the hardcore raid scene on retail and bragging how they'll still be getting content in the future.
---
You can start doing end-game dungeons around 56 pretty easily. The problem is higher aggro radius. 
---
From what I understand Dire Maul will be available at release, even that should be fine, it will just take patience.
---
Okay, but will a vast majority of casuals be queuing up for pvp as much as the pre made teams? 
---
People can only lose so many 10 minute matches till they say “I’m good”
---
And yes they didn’t know better back in the day so I don’t know your argument. So many things have been discovered about vanilla since its inception so I don’t know your argument.
---
People then for the most part just played because everyone was just slowly figuring out things together.
---
I have played Nostalrius and you ran into premades ALOT.
---
It’s seriously not too far fetched to assume what I am saying could be a thing so I’m not sure why you have such a strong mindset to tell me I’m wrong.
---
I suppose our best course is agreeing to disagree and when it launches and this becomes a problem, we can have the argument. If not, then awesome I’m glad it didn’t go that way but I think it will.
---
Well that's not really the point. If you've done difficulty X one tier you should continue doing that same difficulty when the next tier comes around. 
---
Nobody is fucking play Retail anymore, that would be kinda wasted.
---
"Do you have a minute to talk about The Light?"
---
I've told all my friends, SO, and coworkers who have never played, or who played Vanilla long ago. So far, no one has accepted my invitation to play with me. 
---
Only my 10 year old brother has agreed to play with me. I started playing Vanilla when I was 11, so he'll be my teammate. 
---
It is going to take you a hot minute. If it works like private servers it took me at least 20ish hours to level Lopus level 24 pet to 60.
---
Beerform.

(Used to have a druid with this name). 
---
Dire Mall: shopping center for ancient elven goodies alike
---
 I was leveling on a private server today and was surprised to see someone in general chat talking about how they will not play classic due to the subscription since they have been being able to play it for free for a long time.
---
It seemed others were not exactly in agreement but had concerns about how blizzlike classic will be.
---
I play on private servers off and on for a few years now and played back in original vanilla. I am excited for Classic.
---
Started around midnight on vanilla launch. (But the game at Walmart on release, and with tbc, is a story on its own)
---
Played a nelf hunter until mids 40s, rerolled several times, ended with a Tauren warrior. Did everything but aq40 and naxx.
---
A few months into TBC I caught up with some old friends found out they played and rerolled to a human paladin to play with them. Only did BT once, and got my netherwing mount.
---
In wotlk after ulduar I level a kitty druid and fury warrior. I remember being in an argent tournament raid pug and being top dps as a cat  and thinking something was wrong with my party. And my pally finished ICC 10 with my friends.
---
I left 10 days into cata after getting my 3 toons to max level and seeing the worgen event. I loved the WC rts games the cata stuff just could keep my attention.
---
Kept up with the lore online and with YouTube. 
---
Came back in WoD because I wanted to see how the story would play out with the original horde. I was disappointed, especially on Ner'zuls story. Mained my fury warrior for this one.
---
Legion came, and so did I. Leveled so many alts during the event. Mained my pally again, for Tyrion. Found out how awesome and intriguing the DK story was with an Orc. Did all the raids in lfr. 
---
As of now, still have a sub with BFA. I liked the story on the alliance side, haven't finished it on my horde guys because it's just boring and lacks motive. And beside those reputation grinds I find myself doing old content more than anything else. Again finished all content up to now and with lfr, so maybe it doesn't count, but my motive is just to see the story.
---
I actually enjoyed leveling alts post cata. The redone zones had compelling and humerous plots and stories, and I found myself really enjoying the phasing and feeling like I impacted the world. The game really has become a single player game with a raid simulator though.
---
I'm obsessed with vanilla though. It's like crack, and because of that I need to get my wow fix.
---
&gt; Okay, but will a vast majority of casuals be queuing up for pvp as much as the pre made teams?
---
Yes, they have been since the beginning of the game.  Why would you assume history would instantly flip just because of classic? 
---
&gt; People can only lose so many 10 minute matches till they say “I’m good”
---
This is a scenario painted only after your ‘theory’ comes true...  so for this to happen, first you would have to have your theory be true. 
---
&gt; And yes they didn’t know better back in the day so I don’t know your argument. So many things have been discovered about vanilla since its inception so I don’t know your argument.
---
I’m sorry did you pvp back in vanilla?  Do you think that everybody was just clueless on how to get honor easier?  Surely you aren’t this ignorant... if you honest to god believe this there is no point in trying to talk you down on anything else you believe.
---
 &gt; I have played Nostalrius and you ran into premades ALOT.
---
Yeah I did too, and I still play on p servers.  And they aren’t nearly as problematic as you are suggesting.  A full night of bgs I run into like 2? Maybe?
---
&gt; It’s seriously not too far fetched to assume what I am saying could be a thing so I’m not sure why you have such a strong mindset to tell me I’m wrong.
---
It is far fetched in the smallest sense of the word.  I played in every aspect during every time period of this game you can possibly think of and never has it been as bad as you are suggesting.  Maybe on some servers I wasn’t on back in vanilla?  But pservers?  Nope never was an issue even though according to you people ‘knew better’
---
&gt; I suppose our best course is agreeing to disagree and when it launches and this becomes a problem, we can have the argument. If not, then awesome I’m glad it didn’t go that way but I think it will.
---
That’s fine if you think it will.  I’m just trying to talk you down on your silly thought process.  And not trying to sound too condescending but I mean come on.... you threw out 50% of people queing bgs as a common occurrence. 
---
Ah good to hear. I never played much hunter.
---
I need to mute my hype. I'm trying not to think about the game at all. If I do, everything else tastes like ash (read: games). I still want to enjoy playing some other games until "D-day".
---
Started in December of 04 close to then the game launched. Killed more than half the bosses in Naxx though my guild was never equipped to clear it, especially the 4H. I quit at the start of TBC only to come right back in September of 07 where I joined a guild and ended up clearing most of Sunwell. Raided with that same guild throughout all of Wrath but ended up getting burned way out from the quad lockout system that was introduced in T9. Started back up in Legion but didn't really like it to be honest. I fundamentally disagree with the concept of mythic plus(imo 5 mans are only for gearing to raid and nothing more), war/titanforging, and with how most classes only have like 5 abilities now. The game is just shit compared to what it used to be like. 
---
Dude stop, let the druids think they're useful enough to at least bring two. Have a heart.  
---
Threat? It's 10 dps higher than the dal'rends I was passing to other warriors and rogues that I was running through lbrs each week when one of them traded it up to me.
---
My experience is mixed. I have 6 brothers who all played WoW off and on, retail and pservers. Additionally 4 IRL friends and a cousin. We met lots of good people on nost and plan on playing with them as well. 
---
4 of my brothers are planning to play only one is as hyped as I am though. The IRL friends are on the fence if they will enjoy it or not. The guildmates we met on nost are hyped for it. 
---
I teach elementary school, so I am hyped for a summer release. I hope it is as early summer as possible so I can get as much non school year time at launch as possible. 
---
We normally run our own guild and have had mixed success based on our own individual IRL expectations and commitments. I want this time to be our most successful journey yet. 
---
My wife does not mind if I play games, but does not usually participate in them. 
---
\&gt; Yes, they have been since the beginning of the game.  Why would you assume history would instantly flip just because of classic? 
---
Because this time around its different. People have way more information about the game now then they ever have had. So assuming people will want to not waste time, there will be way more people trying to get premades together.
---
\&gt; This is a scenario painted only after your ‘theory’ comes true...  so  for this to happen, first you would have to have your theory be true. 
---
No, this is basic psychology. If youre losing way more than youre winning, most people will just stop doing said thing.
---
\&gt; I’m sorry did you pvp back in vanilla?  Do you think that everybody was  just clueless on how to get honor easier?  Surely you aren’t this  ignorant... if you honest to god believe this there is no point in  trying to talk you down on anything else you believe. 
---
Once again, yes. Most people played the game at face value and the answer wasnt just a google search away. Sure the answer is common sense, but its not something people thought about. You needed to be surrounded by people who said "Hey, if we make a premade group we can get way more honor".
---
\&gt; Yeah I did too, and I still play on p servers.  And they aren’t nearly  as problematic as you are suggesting.  A full night of bgs I run into  like 2? Maybe? 
---
Well Nost was EU, so its entirely possible you played when the major teams were asleep. There were atleast 4-5 teams on each faction rank14 trading with eachother. Alot of them found an easier way to JUST pair up with eachother, to honor farm.
---
\&gt; It is far fetched in the smallest sense of the word.  I played in every  aspect during every time period of this game you can possibly think of  and never has it been as bad as you are suggesting.  Maybe on some  servers I wasn’t on back in vanilla?  But pservers?  Nope never was an  issue even though according to you people ‘knew better’ 
---
Once again, this is a different time period. Teams in current wow have no reason to premade in regular pvp because it doesnt offer them anything. They do Arena and Ranked.
---
\&gt; That’s fine if you think it will.  I’m just trying to talk you down on  your silly thought process.  And not trying to sound too condescending  but I mean come on.... you threw out 50% of people queing bgs as a  common occurrence. 
---
Its silly to who? You? Thats fine and yes you have been coming off as 100% condescending this whole time. I already told you the 50% thing was an example. But factoring in random solos losing all the time against premades will make them quit playing pvp and that 50% could 100% come true.
---
Im done arguing though. I am spending too much of my Sunday night having this rant. Later man.
---
I main tanked for a guild that was pushing server first stuff and got a server first thunderfury.
---
So most guilds will help with consumables repairs etc. Mine did not. I had to earn all my gold myself and had no alt. I picked up mining and that was my only way to farm.
---
So you will if you plan to play in a guild like that you can expect to play a lot. I raided multiple days a week. Had to wake up etc when world bosses were up from phone calls. I would play every weekday from 4:30-1AM raiding / farming / helping with people's dungeons and attunements. Then like 11am-3 am weekends.
---
Every raid night you will be the one doing dire maul for the group. So add at least 20-30 min before your raid start time for that. I would raid maybe 3 hours then after that. Then join meetings (Since main tank is usually in the officer meetings). 
---
It takes a lot of effort but I thought its for sure worth it. I loved it until I burned out. You probably will not need as much as I did but it should be at least 66% of that
---
I'm trying not to get hyped.  I loved classic WoW but I don't want to set myself up for disappointment.  I'll be cautiously optimistic, go in with low expectations and hope to be pleasantly surprised.
---
Yea I wouldn't recommend it either. I had to quit after BWL because I couldn't continue them adding another raid night for AQ + all those consumables without any help. The only help I really got was a free fire resist set for firemaw but that was later.
---
If you mean Zul'Gurub, then it's not. 
---
You need a second person in order to get into the raid in Vanilla. That was all the way like that till Cataclysm I guess? Whatever, the point is, everyone who enters the instance gets Raid Leader's ID, unless they saved on their own. 
---
You gonna invite yourself on your second window (if they keep the restriction in Legion that would be also easy to do, no friends/guildies help required as we've got the "permanent" trial accounts this time around), give yourself a promote and start doing your stuff. After you're finished with your run, you log out on your main character, and after you've successfully logged off, you alt+tab and disband the raid. That would force your main to be ported out of the raid right to the entrance.
---
Nobody knows how that will work in Legacy though, as we haven't got an access to any dungeon yet, and the client itself is not Vanilla nor BFA. We'll have to figure it out when it comes :P
---
1. No they didn't.
---
2. You can't transmog legendaries anyway.
---
Is this how WOW tokens work? People buy them for $25 to sell on the AH for gold, then those that buy on the AH cannot relist it, they can only trade it in for $15 of battlenet funds. 
---
They're before my time so I'm trying to get my head around the for/against arguments.
---
You need them for faerie fire.
---
Hey, posting this mostly in response to Soupa's build after pondering it for a bit. IMO, if you want to buy all new parts, you might as well include a dedicated GPU for a similar price.

Some notes,
---
CPU - Going from 4 core/8 thread to 4C/4T, but gaining single core performance
---
RAM - Can save a bit by stepping down the frequency. APUs gain from the higher frequency memory as it's also the memory for the iGPU
---
Storage - Omitted the 1TB drive and bumped up the SSD to 240GB. Will easily hold your OS, Classic and a few other games
---
GPU - [RX 570 vs Vega 11 iGPU](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-RX-Vega-11-Ryzen-iGPU-vs-AMD-RX-570/m401440vs3924)
---
Overall you're gaining a bit of single core performance and a huge amount of graphics power. Another option though, if you're not averse to buying used, is picking up a refurbed prebuilt and throwing in a low profile GT 1030 or GTX 1050. Something like [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lenovo-ThinkCentre-M92P-SFF-i7-3770-3-40GHz-8GB-DDR3-500GB-Win-10-Pro-64-bit-1/223223289464?epid=118402016&amp;hash=item33f9251678:g:oUcAAOSwBkBb5LlX:rk:5:pf:0&amp;LH_BIN=1).
---
Get yourself ironfoe or alcors sunrazor. Hell viskag, maladath, cts, (other BWL tier weapons) will do. Quel serrar is just painfully slow compared to other options.
---
Well in vanilla my 60 rogue used to run around with Defias set with I think maybe the Barman Shanker for shits and giggles and could still take people down with ease as long as your willing to play the long game. 
---
I'll be the same. Should be OCE servers, and of course NZ guilds to raid on them :) 
---
I remember if in pvp any kind of fear would dismantle a multiboxer. Or you can get up close and just out maneuver them, since they follow the main player, they won't turn towards an enemy unless the player drags them in that direction with follow commands which will stop them from attacking.
---
And anyone who is doing it with multiple classes is really gimping themselves. Many abilities cannot be linked together well. This is why most multiboxers pay the same class. And at that point it doesn't seem like much purpose.
---
Multiboxing is rare and easy to ignore. One day you might experience 5 fireballs at once and die, but I doubt it.
---
There's no reason these original addons can't be updated to work on wow classic, but idk how much modification would have to be done, it may be easier to just backport modern versions of them. Ideally though modern addons that have been backported from private servers that get backported for classic should work better than on the original API backports. I have my hopes up that tidyplates can be backported. 
---
not to be intrusive but if your marriage is on the rocks you should have booked a holiday away just the 2 of you lol
---
It's a lot of work. The API from 14 years ago is almost unrecognizable. I think it would even be easier to start from scratch than try to rewrite vanilla addons to work for Classic.
---
A lot of functionality have been blocked over the years too in order to avoid exploits so some addons might not even be technically possible anymore. Decursive is the prime example of an addon that will never work in Classic.
---
They are remaking classic wow BECAUSE we played on private servers. 
---
Would the smart thing to do be to buff the extreme ends of the talent trees? For example, buffing Moonkin Form itself, which is considered a very weak form and generally a waste of mana. 
---
Decreasing the mana cost would be a PvP buff for shifting. Giving it some sort of mana regeneration, possibly like TBC where melee attacks restore mana, would be a PvE buff. I think they can concentrate where they want the buffs to happen depending on the ability.
---
add loredraker on discord and ill play with you lol
---
Source? 
---
I believe you're forgetting patch theTBC pre-patch which was released December http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_(World_of_Warcraft). 1.12 was only live for about 3 months (22 Aug - 5 Dec) so it can't very well have been around a couple of more months than intended unless they intended it to only be live for 1 month, which seems unreasonable. Furthermore 3 months checks out well with the uptime of other major patches. So I think my argument still stands.
---
If somebody advertises a private realm, then yes, that's bannable.
---
But to what you're saying, I don't think so but there may be some context where it is a reportable offence. Like over a /trade chat convo somebody says, "That's overpriced, on the private server I played, it was only worth this much..."  
---
Ok, thanks for the info!
---
If you're patient, you could wait for the AQ turn-ins to do your rep farming. The materials for that were mostly a lot cheaper than Runecloth.
---
Then again, there's no telling how the AQ event will be handled this time around.

There have been people who have been banned for saying they've used d2jsp to trade items in Diablo 2 but I don't really know the details behind it. I guess my point is there is precedent of them banning people for admitting to doing something apart from the game.
---
At that point just create 3 servers (PvP, PvE and RP) and steal Firefall's home shard system and be done with it.
---
Your home shard is empty? Now you have a new home shard!
---
Add me, I'll heal your dungeons. Disc name is Reddit name
---
That's frigging awesome man, sometimes just one duo is good enough
---
I doubt they would ban you unless you advertised or compelled a player to play on a private server. It would cause a shitstorm if they banned any player for mentioning their experience on an illicit realm, especially because of how many people in Classic will likely have played a private server.
---
I think you would have to get more creative than just touching the classes or specs.
---
Some have brainstormed a lateral gear patch that offer an ability on an item that could be used.
---
I would brainstorm a raid mechanic buff. Let's say you are a prot palladin and you have the holy shield talent. The raid would recognize that and would apply a 'Mana restored when being healed' abilty, 'exorcism can now be used on all mobs and adds a taunt', a modifier to certain spells. These would show up as buffs and once you leave the raid they disappear. 
---
In essence the raid would recognize certain talents a player has and will grant a buff to them while in the raid or dungeon. This buff would modify or add spell abilities to certain moves or just give a flat out passive.
---
I'm not saying this should be implemented, I'm just saying you have to think of unintended consequences, pve AND pvp mechanisms are at play when you change something.
---
No you shouldn’t. The item level for the next tier should be higher than the previous. 
---
Otherwise there is no progression 
---
Hopefully. When i was on retail i saw dozens of australian guilds - never once saw a kiwi guild. 
---
I’m not replying to most of this nonsense as it’s basically just a repeat of what I just said.  But just to clarify one thing.  You said there was 4-5 teams queing bgs on nost to farm honor.  Let me clarify something.  To farm honor you don’t que AV as you have been suggesting.  So this would be like 50-75 players queing bgs as you said (did you count them? Lol).
---
I just find that funny because you said “we know better now” when I knew this back in vanilla that you don’t premade AV if you want honor. 
---
On the off chance you're still around I'd love to be divinated.
---
I only played retail during wrath on my brother's account when I was little and have played some private server wrath.
---
Got to level 20 in the trial version of WoW and thought Blizzard had ruined leveling.
---
Will sub for the first time to play classic and have been agonizing over undead or orc and warrior or warlock.
---
You literally sound like the most condescending 'adult' I have ever had the pleasure to talk to.
---
Once again, AN EXAMPLE. 
---
Farming honor was WSG&gt;AV but depending on things, it could easily be AV everytime. Win trading was always WSG. 
---
You literally sound like the most condesceding 'adult' I have ever had the pleasure to talk to.
---
Just FYI, understanding that just because you think you're right doesnt make you right. I understood your thoughts and rebutted them with my own. We can live it there. You're exhausting.
---
Cant decide between rolling a lock or a priest.
---
ALso might make a 19 rogue twink.
---
Also cant decide if I should roll a mage. I want to try something different. ALL with the intention of PVP
---
No but that fact that I am right makes me right.  I’m sorry that you can’t accept being wrong :( 
---
Also literally 0 times would you q av.  So no it wouldn’t “possibly be av” have fun doing this though 
---
I think there should be zero connection between retail and classic.
---
Fury warriors can tank dungeons just fine, though, why would you need one guy to tank the entire guild's attunements and preraid bis farm? 
---
I was thinking something like this myself. In future expansion would Blizz get rid of lfg, lfr, making quest items sparkle, and seeing where everything is on your map and radar? Blizz implemented these to satisfy players who just want to get stuff done quickly, but the effect it has, I think, actually ruins the game. You don't feel like you actually found anything, you don't talk to anyone, you don't care about the lore or read the quest text.
---
Would Blizz actually roll back some of their  QoL aspects to bring back the community and rpg aspects?
---
Haha I would say it’s complicated. She has some mental health issues, extremist religious views and I have two kids she would brainwash etc.
---
The guild promotes work life balance which includes family time :) 
---
Yes, a straight narcissist, ok!
---
And actually yes, there is FOR SURE times where AV would bea thing.
---
WSG and AV can cause problems with time spent depending on the group youre facing.
---
With a premade, you can steam roll AV not having to have problems ever. WSG, the other team might have someone who hides with the flag you cant find. AV, there is nothing you can do to stop the other team from winning 15mins&gt; everytime other than outplaying them.
---
That's what I'm saying. Normal Uldir dropped 355 and heroic dropped 370 so normal Dazar'alor should drop 370 and heroic 385. Now they've done insane jumps of 30 where normal Dazar'alor drops the same iLvl as mythic Uldir. 
---
What's the point in even bothering with higher difficulties when the gear will be completely useless in the next patch? If you're a heroic raider your upgrades should come from heroic, not LFR or normal.
---
I think I got burnt out just reading that. 
---
you just literally said the opposite of what that other guy said lol
---
I was late to the game and started the very end of MoP. Played off and on thru school. When I was done with school during the start of BfA I played a bit. Got through a few zones and realized how dull I was going to find it. So I haven't played since. It's just not for me. Doesn't feel like an RPG. Alot of grinding that isn't stimulating. Just dull. 
---
I'm not counting when I first picked the game up in 6th grade and just kinda mashed buttons, never making it to Max level. 
---
Classic seems like one of those games I missed because I think I was like 8 when it came out. Hearing about it from my guild friends and from videos makes it seem like the type of game I like. Hard, time consuming but rewarding. Also, I hated being Dadgars lil champion and having to run errands for him thru WoD and beyond. Being a regular Joe as to one of many ashbringers, will be fun to play with. Hopefully it will be a more social experience too as that's always been a a huge draw for me. 
---
WE'RE MC RAIDERS
---
Yup, for me the community is just an added bonus on top of an already good game.
---
I agree with this.
---
The LF system could work imho if you get rid of the instance teleport.
---
But the nuance of having to look at the chats could persuade you into going to a dungeon you wouldn't think of going to. Or people resorting to whispers kind of forces a dialogue.
---
A LFG window setting up a party would just be all butterflies and rainbows, of 'sup', 'yo', and 'omw'. Then traveling to the place while warning of pvp or making sure people had certain things, and then discussing strategies inside.
---
Technically vanilla had something like this with the meeting stones. It's like a bullatin board in front of the instance.  The difference would be you could continue to quest while signing up vs lingering around the instance hoping some would use the feature.
---
Maybe instead of randos if it was more set up like you could see who made the party, kind of like the premade lists is on retail. And the leader can choose who to bring in, so you see their names.
---
I dunno man! That why people just say no to lfg.
---
But you're right on difficulty. Just have one difficulty, difficult. Make people use their tool kit.
---
If I was going to say the same thing I would just upvote it.  Stormstrike is the only thing that might make enhancement better, but I'm not convinced.
---
I’m fine with managed free realm transfers. I know some of this did help the population issues on a few servers. 
---
I’m definitely against paid transfer to your server of choice though. 
---
Yeah I think the streamer thing is overblown. That being said this is a great example of why paid xfers suck. 
---
Doubt it, just don't advertise it.
---
You could always carry the mats and build a camp fire in your grinding spots. It increases spirit while around it. :P
---
Exactly this. 
---
On a side note this sub is getting shilled hard. 
---
The votes in this thread for common sense are ass backwards. 
---
All that happens is Blizzard merges them. 
---
Problem solved. 
---
I believe it's 54 Stam for 1700 mana. By comparison, a simple Renew heals for 810 (not counting gear) for 365 mana.
---
In PvP gear you have, what, 5k mana or so? 30+% of your mana to start with 540 more health is not exactly the best investment in PvP. Especially given the topic at hand: hybrid priest trying to both do damage and throw heals.
---
With the cooldown, absolutely buff yourself. But I'm not buffing myself with Fort every single time. If the flag runner is leaving my tunnel and I res in a hurry, I'm spending ~600 mana on Shadowform and not 1700 mana on Fort.
---
designer and OTC are the two Oceanic (Alliance, not sure if there's any Horde) guilds that I know of on the current large pserver if you're looking to connect with some of the current players. I think both their raid times might get a bit late for kiwis on some nights though.
---
There's also an [Oceanic Discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9tj0u8/discord_for_ausnz_players_classic_wow_oceania/).
---
I'm from Aust but I've been thinking about trying to find an NZ or at the very least an AEST based guild for Classic.
---
I keep finding myself in guilds where the raid times are ideal for WA. Which don't work so well when you're on the East and have 5am starts.
---
The answer is no, I've delved into the official servers over the years and people casually and freely talk about playing on private servers quite a lot, including in some cases threads where blues have replied. Never seen anyone get banned for it, I find it amusing how hard MMO champ clamps down on people discussing private servers when Blizzard themselves are quite lenient considering.  
---
Other examples are somewhat known streamers who have streamed private servers and not had any repercussions from Blizzard. Even so, if you are playing private servers you have no reason to take a chance by broadcasting that information in a way that connects it to your Battlenet account, Blizzard have been lenient towards it until now but that may not extend into the future.
---
I've seen many mods over the years on many different platforms that think that even mentioning the names of private servers is considered advertising.
---
Even the mods on this subreddit think that way.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply!
---
Usually with big boss fights I break out the maps (I created some for C'Thun, 4H, Sapphiron, KT - check them out if you haven't yet!)   
---
Thanks for your thoughts! I'll remember them as I work on the next Boss Guide. Thanks!
---
Yeah, the don't talk shit about the blob. Got it.
---
If I had to choose I would say I hope not, I'm all for invisible walls, terrain change, or pathing changes when it comes to dungeons.
---
I say this as a player who used these techniques myself. It's all about the COMMUNITY 
---
But I honestly don't really care. If it's in I'll do it, if it's not I won't. 
---
Will DM be in release though? Huh blizzard!? HUH!?
---
Thanks guys, you are awesome :')
---
They be stupid to do that. Just imagine the shitstorm that would cause
---
A pserver
---
Combined with the talent that stuns on shadow damage the shield can be hilarious for pvp. Otherwise berserk more than makes up for it in pve.
---
&gt; I pick up fights pretty fast personally. 
---
This is the type of guy who wipes the raid 3-4 times before downloading a raid addon.
---
I was in the top guild back during Naxx release. I was not the MT but the previous guild I was something like a 2ndary but mainly a DPS warrior. The way our guild farmed for consumables was to farm BWL and bring random kids who had gold that wanted certain items. They would pay the guild officers the gold and that would go to the guild bank which would supply us with stuff. Every night in Naxx, I would have to spec into tank (50g) then after the raid was over, I get to spec back into fury war. Imagine having to fund that for a ton of warriors for many nights a week. I dunno how the guild did it but they did it for weeks to get the 4 horseman down which we didn't because the top players server transferred when they opened that up and shit was falling apart.
---
As people said, MT leaves or someone as important, shit falls apart.
---
You will play more than everyone. You will develop an egotistical/sarcastic and demeaning attitude. You will ALWAYS be in a dungeon or raid and will logon before everyone and after everyone is off. Regardless of how much pull you have in the guild you will play a very diplomatic game to acquire the thunderfury. You will be the MOST valuable player on the server and the most dependent player at the same time.
---
My wife is more hyped than i am. We even started some slow leveling in barrens on retail just to have time pass faster. And we both hate retail. 
---
Hi, /u/CrusaderThraex
---
You'd make way more from bitcoin
---
I'd argue 20-40 hours later. For the first few months you should put 60-80 if you ask me.
---
Bear: still fears the target, but the reason for the fright is because of a giant bear that you summon. The bear is an illusion that cannot be targeted or damaged in anyway, and roars continuously for the duration of the spell.
---
* Due to the above change, and out of desire to not confuse players, druids’ bear form has been removed.
---
I'm not associated with them, but https://ministryofdeath.net are NZ based. They just advertised on the Oceanic Wow discord that u/BrkIt linked.
---
vanilla paladin&gt;tbc paladin
---
I think the most insulting thing is no free shipping
---
I never claimed it was the best weapon. I gave being given the manual as an example of guilds helping each other out. That it's not unusual for people to give the tanks consumables or help out with repair gold. The example being how I was given a compendium for passing weapons that dps needed by one of those dps.
---
We're getting patch 1.13.x, not 1.1.0 -&gt; 1.12.2.
---
This won't be a thing.
---
Friend of mine was all about bfa and how it won't get boring.
---
He stopped playing now and wants to play classic. 
---
Sadly on a pvp server though. 
---
1.12 didn't really contain anything. June was the last "content". A lot of pre-BC patches only lasted a month. Also you want confirmation on BC being delayed... google Burning Crusade Delayed. 
---
yeah but many private servers are 1.12 but use itemization from older patches depending on how progressed the server is. 
---
Hunter pets require 25% of normal XP to level.
---
Ex: If you hunter needs 20,000 xp to level from 19-20, it will take your pet 5,000 xp to level from 19-20.
---
So not that bad IMO.
---
And you can pug bwl and ony too. Even aq40 although it needs a good bit more coordination.
---
Having people naxx gewred in the raid could just mean "except for rejuvenation gem, I have less competition for healing gear and get carried by the t3 priest heals. Great!" :P
---
I had a raging hard classic boner in November, died down in December, and now I'm getting pretty back to semi hard.
---
Sorry for the long lapse all, but I'm back! As always I appreciate all feedback. Zul'farrak is in progress and coming soon! :) 
---
Vermintide rules
---
This is a non-issue.  
---
Yeah but we're getting Classic not another private server.
---
Also, if you aren't familiar, this dungeon is one big Indiana Jones reference - starting with the Staff of Tsol. 
---
Entry Totem
---
Yes, just as useless.
---
so you dont think blizzard will use old itemization?
---
What was the deal with trapping the rat at the start?
---
Why would they use an earlier version of an item that was later fixed? They fixed it for a reason. No chance it will be in Classic. 
---
Same.
---
We kept going back every single week (skipping to Gaar and Baron) for all of Vanilla. We cleared everything through 4H in Naxx and never got that damn sword.
---
1337 duration haha
---
Brack Rotus  
---
By a lot larger he means like 100 yards
---
100.0 yards ≈ 91.4 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

i am pretty hyped but most of my friend dont even know what wow classic is supposed to be and i cant really explain it to them :D

Southpark phone destroyer, dont want to burn out on pc gaming. Maybe later i will try witcher or horizon dawn on PS4

Holy lord I thought it was 5% for some reason.

Thank god I hate playing hunter.

Im not saying multiboxing 5 characters is OP. I AM saying that it looks stupid and takes you out of the experience.

Didn't even notice that :P
---
One of the reasons I've started this discord early. Hoping to grow a good base community to help people find others that are close to their own schedule/timezones. NZ appears to be an especially hard community to break into due to to the already low population (comparatively) as well as the spread outedness - being closer to American servers than Aus is, ends up that a lot of NZ players play with American friends. 
---
Hope you can find some folks to play with! :)
---
And before that you'd make way more by using all your savings and borrowing as much money possible to buy GOOGL, AAPL, MS and what have you.
---
This subreddit isn't the place to ask. Most of the active people here will scold you for even considering a spec that isn't meta. You'd have better luck on forums or a class discord honestly.
---
Yeah, thats about what I'd estimate. 20-40 hours is the average i'd give over the course of vanilla. Though " the first month will be rough " meaning, far more than 20-40 hours per week. And ofcourse I mentioned " AS much as the second warrior + a little bit more. " So if that second warrior is spending 80 hours, and you want to be the first in line for Tfury, you will be playing more than 80 or finding a different guild.
---
Add an immunity to all cc for like 5 seconds after casting Escape Artist. Can be lowered if found too OP. Maybe raise the cd to compensate.
---
IF they did some kind of progressive itemization you might see this return.
---
Before patch 1.7 the possible outcomes of eating this was:
---
- (60 min) Yaaarrrr (turns you into a pirate)
---
- (60 min) Flip Out (turns you into a ninja)
---
- (10 sec) Oops (turns you into a pile of goo)
---
- (2 min) Rapid Cast
---
- (10 min) Cowardice (causes 5sec "Run Away" fear)
---
- (5 min) Fake Death
---
All effects other than pirate and ninja transformations were removed in patch 1.7.
---
Since Blizzard pretty much stated they are not doing progressive itemization (as of now) then you will not see the other effects. 
---
Even IF they did progressive itemization, I think certain things would be nerfed like this. That buff was crazy. You won't see it.
---
Haha "balance" hahaha
---
My casual raiding guild had 2 MTs who never missed a single raid as far as I know, which of course is the most important characteristic of a MT.  I was #3 in the tank rotation and I never got a chance to tank anything other than OT stuff on bosses.  However, I never saw either of them spend time farming, or really running 5 man instances once we started raiding the MC.  I tanked far more 5 mans to help people gear up than they did and got about 60 guildies keyed up for Ony while I never saw them run a single group through LBRS for keying.
---
I can only conclude that the guild was funding their activities via the sales of materials from our raids.  The MT had a hunter alt, but he never made it to 60 during Vanilla.  
---
As far as time goes, you'll have to spend a lot of time running stuff for the initial gear up.  Get used to running the same content over and over again until you get that pre-raid item you need.
---
Yup. New raids didn't eclipse old ones. Even when they created "catch up" content like ZG and AQ20, they were adding a new way of getting ready for the 40 mans while also giving players that already had better gear a reason to do this new content (shoulder enchants for ZG, skill books for AQ20). Or when they added a tier 0.5 epic set it required a decent amount of efforts to upgrade the blue set you got from 5 mans to items that were still weaker than MC gear if I recall correctly.
---
The game was getting bigger back then instead of constantly being the size of the latest tier of content. It was ok to not have finished the current raid tier by the time the next one came out. I remember we took a break from attempting C'Thun when Naxx came out to kill 2 bosses there but then we still went back and killed C'Thun later. There's a strong contrast compared to raids after Ulduar. We made a couple of attempts on Algalon but never downed him and once the next tier came out we never went back to attempt him.
---
If they're going to create new content for classic after AQ40 releases I want the new content to have one simple rule. New content can't eclipse old content. That means that new gear that's easier to obtain than old gear shouldn't be of an higher ilvl. No level cap increase, no easy mode raid that drops better gear than the previous tier's hard mode. Let people progress at their pace. Have retail wow be a treadmill for those that enjoy it, classic wow should be a giant mountain to climb.
---
We just got cutting edge last night. I dont really underatand the downvoting because raiding is atleast 10 hours of fun weekly for me. Raiding is one of few aspects that is still good in the game. I dont do much other stuff besides some rbg.
---
theres greens that are pre raid bis so i doubt we will see itemscore in classic. maybe tbc as i think warmane has itemscore on that server
---
In retail, I get bored easily (partially ADD), so I have a few alts that I rotate through. I'm interested to see how this translates to Vanilla, since leveling even one toon is a labor of love. I started a test toon on a friend's account and played a mage for a few hours in Vanilla while he sat with me and helped me learn. But BC was imminently launching so I waited a week or so and bought that when it came out, therefore I officially started the game in BC. I can't wait to play Vanilla extensively, and I intend to try to have three toons, but one of them will definitely be a clear main.
---
300+ tries on G'huun ( current final boss ) also feels like progress. But leveling from 11 to 14, mining from 52 to 58 is the true feeling of progression.
---
Global cooldown is 1.5 so what's the point of cast times shorter than 1.5?
---
Legion felt better but progres-raiding is still one of the most fun aspects of the game. If you are if a guild you enjoy atleast.
---
What about servers that are no longer active?
---
There is an Axe @ ~14 from Serena Bloodfeather quest in the barrens, takes some running.
---
WC quest has a staff with int, but good damage, worth using if you have nothing else.
---
Tree boss in WC drops a staff with a ton of Spirit and good dmg. Very nice weapon, even though it's a staff.
---
People still leveled multiple pets.  I personally levered a boar from RFK from 25is to 60 after I was 60.  Ran a lot of instances with the pet in passive mode.  After doing that I stuck to pets close to 60.
---
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
---
Being able to move out of fire and stuff
---
We took priests starting at 56 to every end game dungeon.  Typically the group would have to do a bit more killing because we couldn't skip and take it easier due to less healing, but the primary shortage class at the time was healers.
---
im just saying that as an example. plus for pvp its harder to get interrupted with a .5second cast 
---
If there is a market at $6,000 then I wonder how many I'd be able to sell there. And how large is the $5,000 market? If I'm going back in time and stocking up on these I wonder if I just need a few boxes to satisfy the market down to $100/per. Or should I risk suffocation and accidents filling the cockpit with WoW Collector's Edition to the point that I can't expand my chest to breathe and can't see the controls?
---
Ration them out man. Sell one every two years or something.
---
you have no idea what you are talking about lol
---
Even if a raiding guild allows you to play Elemental, it wouldn't be enjoyable for you. You will be out of mana the first minute of a boss fight and you will have no good way to regenerate it. I tried it on Nost, didn't work out.
---
I started day 1 of Vanilla wow.  The lag was so bad that it was unplayable for a couple of days, but after that it was wonderulf.  I basically became a semi-active with TBC.  Flying mounts had taken the fun out of world PvP, the instances sucked in their design, though not nessiliarly their content or mechanics. It just didn't feel as alive as vanilla.  They'd finally killed the dishonor system, but the only town to raid was a natural city so it didn't really matter.
---
To be honest, though, my interest in wow started waning after the introduction of the dishonor system.  That effectively kill town raids which by far was the most interesting part of Warcraft.  TM vs SS was all that was left of large scale outdoor PvP after that change.  No more taking over crossroads or other locations with a large group and AoE the guards while waiting for the other side to counter-attack.  Attacking city leaders became a no no because you couldn't fail to kill some quest givers via AOE trying to deal with the guard spam.
---
How about making entry into the dungeon/raid cost up front resources. So everytime a group wants to run Strat or Naxx, they have to fork up loads of ores/bandages/herbs to get the one time use key
---
Almost all my friends will be playing classic and I didn't even have to convince them. The amount of people that have played WoW back in the day and are planning on returning this summer is amazing.

I've been reigning in my hype because I have a nagging feeling that a lot of people are going to be playing the game like they play MMORPGs these days. On top of that. a LOT of people are going to be going into the game thinking they'll get Thunderfury or Sulfuras, which will end up causing no end of toxicity because there will be way more people than those weapons going around.

I just modestly hope that there will be people who wants to take it slow, have fun and re-experience the world, so I've got people to play with.
---
You still could give it a better title like: "What are your thoughts on the PVP exploit featured in this video?" 
---
What are your thoughts on patching in a Dual spec option. That is my only anti fun concern i have with classic.
---
Wanting to PvP and raid as a warrior and priest its going to be a massive time and gold sync.  
---
No 
---
Eh I just don’t see how it’s going to cause a problem. Even if it was free with no cooldown it would be a minority of players using it regularly (though in that case it would be economically abusive for sure.)
---
With even a $5 fee (lower than it’d ever be) it would be pretty rare for people to do it unless they were motivated to get off the server more than on an impulse, and for $50 it would be an extreme anomaly for transfers other than to play with RL friends or get off a dead server. I think you are overstating the number of people that would both have the resources and the will to spend $50 on the regular to move servers. Even if you have 1 allowed transfer ever, server distributions would end up similar to if you could transfer on a shortish cd or with a sizable fee... and most people won’t transfer more than once ever anyway(per character anyway) I’d wager bigly.
---
Anyway I’m sure we just disagree on how people will behave, but I really think when transfers became a thing in vanilla it didn’t have any appreciable negative impact on server communities.
---
Hey, fuck you.
---
I'm really excited, but student me no longer exists. I'll be 33 when it releases, it will be summer cycling season and even that has to compete with partner and child.
---
Instead, I will be doing God's work for you all. I'll be levelling maybe an hour at a time to begin with, then I'll stsrt my journey from level 15 as a protection warrior for all your dungeon needs, and nothing else. I intend to tank dungeons to 60 ;-) 
---
Click bait doesn’t deserve visibility 
---
I’ll wait for someone else to make a video.
---
You should raid their cities more often.
---
that is the most jr high way of making money i've seen for a looooong time
---
alll of it
---
Nope.
---
Gold sinks are important.
---
Yes they are, there are dozens of us. 
---
Why?
---
most private servers ban pvp in multibox, aka if you get caught attacking somebody with multiple characters, you get a ban.   If you are attacked, you can fight back with only 1 character. 
---
I think blizzard should make the same rule,  pve is ok, pvp is a suspension. 
---
I played on a lot of pservers and even there, with free accounts multiboxing was very rare, you hardly saw them.  So I don't think it will be much of a problem if it cost people $75 a month 
---
&gt; You should have to live with your reputation on the server.
---
If you had someone on your friend list, you would see him (and his new name) after name change.
---
I just got off the phone with my accountant. He thinks that the capital investment in the process of creating a machine that can bend time and move me millions of miles through space is $tens of billions minimum. He does not think that trading in the WoW Collector's Editions market will sufficiently compensate for initial costs. 
---
For anyone else curious like I was, here's how much these stocks have grown, from 2004 to today:
---
GOOGL: 12.5x
---
AAPL: 100x
---
MSFT: 4x
---
In other words don't waste your time with anything else, just buy the crap out of apple stock. It's mind boggling how much they grew.
---
This comment section is crazy.
---
As someone who only ever set foot in Molten Core once for about 7 minutes “back in the day”, I’m not entirely sure if I should be watching this or not.
---
Taurens would be able to eat flowers for various 5 - 10 min bufs simmilar to potions/scrolls.
---
Have you tried multiboxing?  I found it super boring after the initial excitement wears off.  sure the first weekend it was fun, trying stuff out you never could do solo, but it became boring real quick. 
---
So I would do a practice run on a free server that allows it first, to test if you actually like it enough to make this investment in classic.  
---
That isn't actually representative because current price hasn't taken into account things like buybacks, shares splitting and how much in dividends they pay.
---
There's no way In hell that will sell.
---
You're right, it would be even better than 100x (thanks to dividends)! From what I can tell the data I'm using (google) uses post-split numbers retroactively applied to the stock's history. So the numbers it shows for 2004 aren't what they actually were, but the proportions work out the same. This is confirmed by a random investopedia article concluding a similar 100x growth, and they accounted for original prices and share splits.
---
That’s just dumb and not useful at all. The GM’s are at the top of the food chain in the Blizzard company. If they don’t know it no one does. They could also use their omnipotent powers.
---
And on top of that, he charges for shipping. What a mad lad.
---
Unfortunately, no one of my friends shares my passion for WoW Classic :( Their typical reaction is like: "You are weird. Are you really going to play 15-years-old game? But it's grindy and boring!"
---
Server first Lucifron on Kilrogg, was 27 people wearing mostly green gear. 40 people shouldn't have too much difficultly.
---
Not really thinking this will happen, more of a mental jerkoff moment, but wouldn't it be awesome if "Decursive" was deemed "too excessive" for a Classic addon, and suddenly Lucifron is this huge gatekeeper raid boss when he used to be a simple "Do you know what an addon is? Good go download this addon and click it. Thanks" boss?
---
The way that was solved in vanilla was new servers came online later.. you could join one of those if you wanted to start fresh.
---
That's an interesting theory but all I know about time and money is that TIME IS MONEY, FRIEND.
---
BITCONNEEEEEEEEEEEEECT
---
There is no 20man raid covering the AQ-&gt; Naxx difficulty. Grim Batol could fill that role. 
---
He placed a dig rat so he could rocket helm it to get out of flag room. He freezing trapped it so it wouldnt move out of los. https://classicdb.ch/?item=5052 https://classicdb.ch/?item=10588

that's two letters! you're out! 
---
It’s not a tldr the boss has like 2 ability’s. Lol 
---
Also its a big difference wasting 39 other peoples time. Put few of those in the raid and you will be wiping whole night. This is why in vanilla in average guilds discipline wins over skills, and why in top guilds you need both.
---
Friends: literally no one seems excited and its driving me bonkers
---
SO: vaguely aware that there is a game I'm looking forward to being released in the summer, doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation despite me explaining "so I've played this game for about 75 full days...so that's 75x24 hours...I plan on playing it alot just so you know..." she seems to think it's going to be something like RDR2 that I play until I beat and quit. She is not prepared.
---
On to what I actually want to talk about: Asmongold. I watched one of his videos for about 20 seconds and his voice was very screechy, he seemed entitled, he was overall whiny and narrow minded, and I got all of that out of about 20 seconds of video. I immediately clicked it off and thought "Cheese and rice I'm a nerd but come the fuck on". I'm a 30 year old guy, I played WoW and sports in high school, I have a fulltime meaningful job and a great girlfriend of several years, I dont do well with whiny kids. Part of why I dont have any of my own. Should I give him a chance, or is he one of those "personalities" that seem popular on the "WoW scene" but I personally absolutely cannot stand?
---
Sony Ericsson T630, that's what I used to have back then.
---
I still remember the red tint of keyboard backlight, that appeared after the phone felt into soup, and got just fished out and still working
---
You don't want to intentionally scare away future paying customers.
---
Me and my girlfriend are planning on playing a lot. We've done a fair bit of planning.
---
Hmm, I don't know where did you get this, but I'm pretty fine with working with games. 
---
I could elaborate how I've been programming since 12, my mods, custom servers, software engineer degree. But I would just bore you, and you wouldn't care.
---
Because for some reason you like to be a **downer to people you know nothing about**.
---
I'm not worried about myself... I know my flaws and strengths. 
---
I'm worried about less self-confident people, who will **change their mind**, or **give up their dreams**, due to your **non-sense, unfounded negativity.** 
---
Be a better person, and **motivate people**, instead of pulling them down.
---
Thanks for reading this, and sorry if I was a bit too harsh, maybe I even misunderstand your comment. I just woke up, so there is a chance :D :D
---
I would call these people "wannabe-elitists" though, because the truly good players will know how little difference the gear makes :)
---
A "proper" ItemScore certainly would. But a "proper" ItemScore also doesn't exist, yet people require it...
---
Started day 1 of Vanilla in the EU (Feb 2005)
---
Finished very shortly after I reached max level in Cataclysm (Jan 2011)
---
In my opinion, the exact moment WoW started going downhill was half way through this time - patch 2.4 (March 2008).
---
Things then really went further downhill with patch 3.2 (August 2009).
---
Youd make more from Spy calls every year from 2008 to 2018 by like 100x
---
Using a 10k population private server or something as your basis where black lotus still spawn at regular 2-4k server rates, of course flasks will cost more because 2-3x as many people need flasks so demand is higher. 
---
And of course more vendor loot is being generated which means more gold in the economy so the inflation causes prices to rise. That 50-100g flask on p server is probably more like 10g on a regular server starting out initially. 
---
Also depending on blizzard, these cloth turn ins might not be in at the start.
---
Probably make more from inventing a time machine....
---
I mean. No offense to the OP, but that's the case with most MMOs.
---
Vanilla games tend to be about the journey as much as about the end-game (the good ones, there're loads of games that released with very little end-game content), and expansion - by design - are a 5-10 level gain and THEN you begin the "real" content in the expansion.
---
I don't think there was ever an expansion in an MMO centered around "the journey" as it would be short and pointless.
---
But that doesn't mean an expansion can't genuinely be great with loads of content overall.
---
Nah, because the first person you sell it to will go back and invent it first. 
---
I have maintanked/co-led/co-raidled an MC/BWL clearing guild and the time investment is BIG.
---
You are expected to attend 100% of the raid. Not 70%, not 80% and not 90% but 100% of the raids. You are also expected to know all the tactics in detail and be able to explain these to the raid. You are expected to lead the raid atleast in regards to markings, assigning offtanks, positioning of mobs, casters, healers, pull-directions etc. You are expected above everyone else to always use full consumables (including flask of titans) every single raid, others might be able to get away with being cheap-o but you wont. In addition to all these things, you will be expected to lead and organize off-raid activities such as helping guildies clear UBRS for their Onyxia/BWL attunments as well as BRD for MC attunments.
---
It is (almost) a fulltime, or atleast part-time job. Expect to be burned out unless you have a passion for tanking, a passion for leading people and a passion for micromanagement. The only roles that I didnt shoulder was healing assignments (healing officers did that) and masterlooting.
---
TLDR: Be ready for a BIG responsibility.
---
I can confirm this. 
---
Unless you want to be a tank.
---
Well it's arguable dungeon set .5 and zg are catch up mechanics. 
---
What's wrong with hype? Also there are huge numbers still playing retail who are looking forward to Classic.
---
yes and pve ret is much better in tbc too
---
Wife Tap 
---
Not much better unless you are a Blood Elf. Seal of Blood is the best DPS seal. The top end Ret talent 3% raidwide crit is good but most people still didn't feel it's good enough to take a Ret.
---
Not if I go back and stop them first!
---
Patch 1.6! Still technically playing but I have done nothing online in weeks other than the occasional old raid. Skipped MoP and Legion, most of Cata and quit WoD about a month in, then came back toward the end.
---
Because fury warriors are notorious for not wanting to tank even if to save their own life.
---
yeah its pretty bad and imo having 3 dps abilities (cons, judgement, exorcism) not scale with strength or attack power is why its so balls. a level 70 with 0 gear does the same damage as a t6 paladin with those spells. but still having crusader strike and especially windfury totem pretty much makes ret much better. sob is also a lot better but especially with seal twisting. its been awhile but there was some raid logs showing the best dps for each respective spec and a ret paladin with seal twisting was near the top
---
For early progress raiding, Quel'serrar is an excellent weapon, well balanced in both threat and defensive values. That being said, It is replaced in BWL (for threat) but still remains a great pure-def wep for the entirety of vanilla.
---
I want to try out a few new games, France getting the full inheritance, the Daimyo vassel swarm and just a regular Aragon game.
---
Instead started yet another England run yesterday trying to get the achievement for 25 dev in all English provinces. 
---
Alcors is only great for rage-capped situation: Basically vaelstrasz.
---
Source: have tanked all content in vanilla with both Alcors, Quel'serrar and TF.
---

---
Just buy Bitcoin at less than 1cent, and sell at 12k.
---
I agree 100%.
---
Speaking as a warrior that both tanks and dps on the regular.
---
Watched your 4H guide, never really "understood" the fight fully before (only did the wotlk ezmode version). Your vid was by far the most well explained - the use of the graphics was an excellent touch. Really top notch work man!
---
Ho There!
---
Mained a tank in vanilla, always willing to help run dungeons, quests, building the guild, etc., looking to rock some prot again in classic, would love to find a fun adult guild with the following details:
---
NA, PvE, Horde, EST, social/raiding
---
Thanks all!
---
If you're NOT the MT then you can just use the 31/5/15 warrior build that gives you an Arms build with Defiance and shield block. Loads of warriors ran this spec as it lets you PvP and tank perfectly fine.
---
If you ARE the MT though then not having a pvp spec is one of the sacrifices you need to make in return for getting all the shiny tankloot first.
---
Another thing a lot of raid groups did is raid on a two weekly basis. One week they raid Monday night. Next week they raid Tuesday. Then after Tuesday the entire group can respec to PVP for 12 days until the next week's Monday raid.
---
this works unless there is a large skill disparity.
---
Vaguely hoping I'll be able to get time off of work for launch week. Realising I might not. I'll be disappointed to have to miss it.
---
As a vague rule of thumb, you'll have to be online more than most other raiders in your guild and basically never skip a raid, especially early on.
---
I don't know if that was a spelling error or an intentional lisp lol
---
Get the pet you want as you level. BT will be a pain in the ass to get.
---
Bis lists are meant to take that into account, obviously.
---
Beard form - New Dwarf racial instead of a druid form
---
People know when they're ripped off in that context because they don't get the item they won...
---
Good info, ty!
---
my guild took my 57 lock alt to ZG because drain mana was a thing for one of the bosses.  
---
resist,resist,resist,resist,resist  
---
58 works, but 57 does nothing but aggro extra packs
---
The biggest problem are the people who don't know about the gear progression of individual classes. Some classes may go without changing more than a few pieces of gear for an entire raid tier or two simply because there's no suitable upgrades. People who don't understand this may not invite you to a raid despite the fact that you're adequately geared.

*&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [A] EU-PvE | English language*
---
*Our Philosophy:*
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
*Who are we looking for:*
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably. This means that people should show up and perform sufficently. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
*Raiding related information:*
---
    - We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one char.
---
    - Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
    - Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
I was going to make the same suggestion.  Would have been curious to know how much YOUR haul was on the server you are currently on, just to get an idea.  
---
Me too !
---
Greetings,
---
&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP/PvE) is interested in knowledgeable raiders and pvp-ers alike. 
---
About us:
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on EU-Boulderfist and I am writing these words, several friends of mine and old guild members just agreed to resurrect &lt;Hate&gt; for World of Warcraft Classic. 
---
We were quite prolific in both Raiding and PvP, being nicknamed the High Warlords Guild since the biggest amount of Rank 14 players (names like Quattro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). 
---
On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, before TBC released. This was done without fancy addons, Youtube movies or strategy tips (almost non-existant at that time), so we hope this speaks for itself. On a side note, our guild invented the Searing Pain aggro spam tactic for Battleguard Sartura when we saw our full T2 tanks going down like flies.
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; again and try to replicate as much as possible our original classic performance. Therefore, if you are interested in our project, please don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK
---
Your truly,
---
Kha of &lt;Hate&gt;
---
Intended region: (EU)
---
Intended server type: (PvP)
---
Intended faction: (Horde)
---
Intended raid/play times: (3 times per week for \~3 hours raid session, late afternoons/early evenings)
---
Any priority you may have in a guild: (Raiding)
---
Any pertinent rules: a ton but not the place nor the time to discuss them
---
A preferred form of contact: Discord link https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK
---
Be fair and avoid favoring one over the other.         
---
Respect peoples opinions and "punish" those who deserve it.       
---
Like with any leadership position, a GM needs to be able to be strict when needed, but also motivating towards those you lead.        
---
About advertisement, make a post on the official forums, server forum/discord.          
---
Recruit in General chat or trade, but don't spam it 3 times a minute(i personally avoid those guilds like the plague).         
---
Talk to people in dungeons or people you meet out in the world.        
---
To get people to stay, just follow the first points essentially, people will generally like a good leader and stick around.       
---
And it's  fairly easy to tell if someone wants to join because of the guild or because of loot if you do a trial period for new members where they won't get loot for a week or two, might be seen as harsh but it's a favorite of mine.
---
For starters, you need a trusted, right-hand man. Probably two. People you really gel with. It's a big task to undertake all by yourself. It's nice to have help and a second or third opinion. 
---
If it's not a completed auction it doesn't mean shit. It's only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
---
i'm not a multiboxer, but my thoughts:
---
warlock / priest- competes with your main for gear, personally i'd try to get one character per armor class
---
Hunter - dealing with a deadzone while trying to control a tank....  not saying this is impossible but i'd guess its damn hard
---
Warrior - most people struggle to play a good tank while they are controlling a single character.  trying to tank / DPS &amp; heal all at once will be super challenging.
---
&gt; After you get MC geared
---
Point being, you shouldnt need to use runes and VERY rarely potions. Early on in BWL razorgore and Nef you should do atleast potions, but other than that, no need to. I atm play on paladin main in pre-aq patch. I can have 650+ healing with ~100mp5. Or something like 850-900+ healing (15mp5). But generally i use shard of the scale + ZG trinket resulting in ~800 healing and 32mp5 from gear (+elixir and oil).
---
Thats without rejuv gem. Most of the time increased flash just means more overhealing when you have people spamming heals, all the time.
---
And TBH, there are quite few items from mc you should every be using. Half of them should be instance greens. I rather have super regen running from boss to boss in MC than maxed out +healing, when i can see almost EVERY fucking heal going 50%+ to overheal.
---
Start as a leveling guild, but specify you’re aiming for more. Politely ask guildless people of your levels if they want to join, but don’t mass spam with guild invites. Make some friends who’ll invite leveling people too. Kick out toxic people without regret. Help healers and tanks. Ask for help and help others. Define raid time relatively soon. If you have not enough core members, be ready to unite with another guild.
---
I have a few Starcraft II CE I'm hoping one day shoot up like this =/
---
Good advices. How do you differ your guild from other guild ? 
---
For the recuiting, at the begining since you need people you are easy recruiting almost everyone willing to join or is it better even at the start to be "strict" on the recruitment ?
---
I, for one, am very happy to read the part about addons:
---
*On the other end of the spectrum, the modern API offers some additional functionality for creating social features that could also undermine the authentic classic experience.*
---
It sounds to me they are aware that group finding addons is a real threat and that they want to activly prevent them. Great news!
---
&gt; N e e d
---
Well, you dont really NEEED anything. But after crit and +healing, id say thats the stat i look for with int. And stamina is nice too. So if i get 1mp5 for 1-2 +healing ratio, i will usually take it.
---
Same thing with stamina, no healer NEEDS stamina, but it sure fucking helps.
---
Again I'll repeat for both of you. "I will look of the fight ahead of time if I need to" "I want to stay as fresh as possible". Holy fuck you guys are judgmental as fuck. You should really try playing the aids raid of tomb of Sargeras where one person could wipe the entire raid after 50 times playing the boss. Also mentioned I'm not going hardcore.  
---
No sense in looking up boss fights 10 months ahead of time.
---
Well I would buy bitcoin if i had a time machine then.
---
I know that MS was great in pvp, but does an arms warrior find a place in a raid?
---
Dont mind What Im saying i have just spent 4 year On private servers and downed bwl mc and AQ under 36 min each
---
Technically you can get banned for admitting to play on a private server but as long as its "on topic" I doubt it will be a problem.
---
League of legends mostly and a bunch of single player games on the side. RE2 Remake coming in less than two weeks 💪
---
Group finding addons ? You mean vQueue that only takes notice if someone says LFM in chat ? How is that a threat, its VANILLA LIKE. That thing you wanted, right ?
---
\&gt;Point being, you shouldnt need to use runes and VERY rarely potions.  Early on in BWL razorgore and Nef you should do atleast potions, but  other than that, no need to.
---
Better +healing and using potions+runes gives you better HPS than worse +healing and not having to use potions+runes. It's just another way you can make your character's performance better by preparing outside of raids.
---
\&gt;Most of the time increased flash just means more overhealing when you have people spamming heals, all the time. 
---
While this is sometimes the case, there's also many situations where a stronger FoL simply results in a better throughput.
---
\&gt;And TBH, there are quite few items from mc you should every be using. Half of them should be instance greens. 
---
The only instance green you should be using is \[Gallant's Wristguards\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=18459](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18459)). Notable upgrades from MC include \[Helm of the Lifegiver\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=18870](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18870)), \[Choker of the Fire Lord\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=18814](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18814)) (though I doubt most guilds would let you have it), \[Wild Growth Spaulders\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=18810](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18810)), \[Salamander Scale Pants\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=18875](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18875)), \[Azuresong Mageblade\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=17103](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17103)), \[Malistar's Defender\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=17106](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17106)) and 2x \[Cauterizing Band\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=19140](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19140)). Regardless, my point was more about having gear appropriate for having progressed through MC and Ony.
---
\&gt;when i can see almost EVERY fucking heal going 50%+ to overheal.
---
From my personal experience this isn't a huge issue as long as you try to predict damage instead of just reacting to it.
---
I very much doubt that. You could however get banned for advertising or encouraging players to play on private servers. I guess the definitions of "advertising" can be fuzzy though.
---
Not as WoW is designed... Singleplayer  RPG's work because there is focus on the narration of sidequests, dialogue and story.  In WoW lore/story obviously plays a big part, but it's the progression and community that's most important.
---
So about as far from the casual scene as you can get?
---
Id say things are going to be VERY different than in vanilla. We raided retard number of hours back then, now in a guild we knock out pre AQ content like its nothing. In times that nobody would have believed back then.
---
If they do same kind of timeframe between MC, BWL, AQ and naxx, i think the levelup and preraid bis is the "hardest" grind you have to do. After that you can just start do raids and prepare for the future. With buying mats, gear etc.
---
Undead are actual undead and paladin, priest spell work on them.
---
Just to add: try to learn everything about game and environment: guilds and noticeable players around you, game mechanics, tactics, gold farm, important quest chains, items, attunements, etc. Search the net, browse reddit and forums, watch youtube, etc.
---
If you constantly party with the same 4 other people your guild might feel you are elitist as well.
---
Make sure your guildies feel like they know you. Paying favorites will always drive a wedge, and if an argument pops up in the future do you best to try to settle things peacefully. I've seen so many vanilla guilds dissolved in heated arguments over stupid things. 
---
A lot of time. Guilds are usually paying for MT consumables, but not all of them, and an MT that is able to sustain himself financially is a massive + for the guild unity.
---
As for TF, the guild will 100% supply the mats/gold for mats. Everyone will be happy to do it.
---
I cannot tell you how many hours/week are needed, but MT's guild activity is not only farming for gold and do raids. That is the minimum you want. 
---
I'd say 3-4 hrs/day minimum to be online, so like 20-25 hrs/week. But during the first months (raid progress in MC and BWL) you will have to spend A LOT more time being online.
---
you dont have to run people through attunements or helping get pre raid gear or any of that. from my experience each person is responsible for getting their own pre raid bis gear and attunements and if people want to help thats cool. also most guilds will pay for the tanks repair on progression when dying a lot.

Hi, /u/knotic1
---
What loot system are you going to use?
---
Do you know the raids well enough to lead them or do you have a raid leader that can help you. (Bosses, ALL pulls, positioning, debuff priority, route strategies, etc. etc.)
---
How are you going to manage the gbank?
---
What kind of commitment do you expect from your raiders? Consumables? World buffs?
---
How are you going to manage, track and distribute assignments? (Tanking, Healing, Decurse/Dispell, Sheep, Power Infusion, etc)
---
Are you a spreadsheet God or know someone who is?
---
Do you know every class well enough that you can train up new players? Or do you have class leaders that can?
---
-
---
These are some of the questions you should be asking yourself.
---
Depends on server progression, in start everyone wants to run instances, later on ... not so much.
---
People don't buy those though. It's not like they are selling like hot cakes
---
Around 15-24hours from fresh depending on how efficient you are. So yeah a long fucking time.
---
It was fixed for a reason. It was supposed to be a fun gimmic thing but once its potential realized it was abused and its terrible for game design.
---
So no.
---
That's true but if you look at something like DCIX from 2016. You can see where there is a problem with that. 
---
&gt; While this is sometimes the case, there's also many situations where a stronger FoL simply results in a better throughput.
---
Well, lets just say when you have 11-12 healers in MC/BWL, you can either spamheal regardless if they take damage, react to the damage (and use some autotarget addon) or heal based on inc damage (everyone does, so even this might not work).
---
Watched some BWL logs, every healer had 33 to 50% of overhealing. Druid had ~66% of overhealing. On bosses.
---
Meant to say blues, like dm pants, belt, head, gloves, offhand and boots. Strat ud chest (later neck), craft shoulders, bracers green/blue. BRD mace etc.
---
Good luck if you take fire lord, mageblade... Lifegiver is like 0.5% drop rate, cant even remember if i have ever seen it in private servers. you might get 2nd cautering band if you get 12+ of those to drop, right ?
---
Joined in US open beta, left a few weeks into cata. Came back a few weeks for WoD but it was still shit.
---
People are taking non max level healers all the time on the p server i'm currently on, it's not a problem.
---
Yes, so What il trying to tell You is that Its not casual to spend 4+ hours to clear mc. Since most casual cant sit infront of The computer for that many hours
---
Hes was talking about heals, only thing you need to worry about is asspulling stuff you can skip as L60.
---
creats macro - YOUR THE BOMB, RUNAWAY! 
---
/GETPHATLEWT
---
I have done most instances in the L54-56 level range in healing spec (guild runs), so it was more organized with proper CC's. But yeah, 58 should be totally fine.
---
This is a great description, basically even for casual and semi-hc guilds, the maintank still needs to be the guy that is the most active. People that want to log in for few hours a day won't be able to fit into this role very well. However, if this is the case, you can still tank as offtank occasionally and be a fury main, which should be a lot less time demanding.
---
Since when do you have to do it in one run?
---
These are always sealed and I guess a big part of the appeal would be getting the 3 exclusive pets.
---
Anybody knows what is a reasonable price for a used cd key box but otherwise in great condition?
---
Is there a specific need to be different from other guilds?         
---
Most raiding guilds are basically the exact same, biggest difference is the members and general mood of the guildchat or timezones.          
---
There are some exceptions though, like RP on weekends or specific rules during raids, for example: No addons or only gear that drops in that raid or below.            
---
In the beginning you can just invite people that want to join and then deal with it when the time comes if they are problematic.         
---
If there are problematic people, deal with it in whispers, not in guild chat.       
---
I was in a guild where the guy who was promoted to GM started calling people out by name in the guild chat and on vent, the guild disbanded within 2 weeks after that.
---
Becaus it takes about 1-3 hours to fill the raid with randoms. So doing that 2x times pr week just to clear mc is abit Much to ask The Leadership of The raid :) 
---
So The normal thing to do is to join strong guilds with semi competetiv players pug runs when They farm for tf On thier alts 
---
yes
---
I can't get it out of my head, every time my friends and I are talking about ANYTHING game related and something that was in WOW comes up I just grimace. Every time you think you have it out of your head somebody says something that puts it right back in there.
---
I thought I had my race/class all picked out but now I keep watching all these pvp videos and can't change my mind.
---
I am also STRUGGLING to not play a private server and save my excitement.
---
Good link thank you.
---
Well I didn't decided yet most of your questions. It will be usefull for later.
---
Is it really mandatory to know "everything". I mean, I think I can delegate some of it like reidleader and class leader ?ada
---
I just remember being lost in here for days.
---
&gt; I wonder though, how hard would it be to code perception to only reveal the mobs to the caster &amp; not actually remove stealth..
---
That's what it already does, though in a much lower radius.
---
CHAOS DUNK
---
What timezone/server type? You might get some people on the discord or here.
---
Casual doesn't mean small numbers nor lack of organisation though. Raiding guilds full of casuals can easily just have a pre-booked time to arrive. 7pm, Thursday night. Log on, invite to group. Raid for 2 hours.
---
Do it again Sunday. 
---
All you need to do it turn up, add to that pugs will be able to form very quickly if servers are busy. As long as you have tanks and healers, the rest is not overly important in early raids. Casual also doesn't mean bad. For example i'm unlikely to have much free time, but know all the bosses, know rotations, know roughly what gear to get. Sure it will take me longer to get the gear, and consumables will be low, but that doesn't mean people will struggle to down bosses.
---
Especially considering we are likely to use 1.12 talents, maybe 1.12 itemisation and non-buffed bosses.
---
They don't actually sell for that much. Sealed goes for like 1-2k max, open but mint is usually 300-400.
---
See now, just because someone posts it for that much, doesn't mean someone is actually going to pay that for it.
---
I can put a stick on EBay for 2 trillion dollars, but that doesn't mean the stick is worth that or that anyone will actually pay it, but you'll for sure be able to see that stick up there with an asking price of 2 trillion.
---
Yeah they kinda worked out that way didn't they. The reason for creating them was to give people someplace to play though since they had more players than they had server space.
---
Even if they decided for the old itemization and item progression, they would be selective about it. Meaning that a buff like this wouldnt go through. There was a big drama before a popular vanilla pserver launch where they wanted to implement the buff early on. Long story short they got so much hate they cancelled it, because it would really make casters insanely OP, as well as making the content too easy.
---
I get that Mythic is harder than ever, and makes raiding in Classic look like a cakewalk. But I feel like the accomplishment of hard raiding is robbed by easier difficulties. At least in Wrath, most of the easy-mode 10 mans weren't pushovers so every raid had a sense of reward to it. Meanwhile, ever since Dragon Soul with the introduction of LFR, even moreso since Seige of Org with Normal Modes, the idea of allure and progression is kind of non-existent to me. 
---
Did you gild your own video?
---
Depends heavily on the game. Enthusiasm, Deadly Boss Mods (or some such) and a heavily modified UI can make up for almost any skill deficit in WoW PvE.
---
Let me approach this from another side than most comments here:  
---
Do you want to be the MT because you just love tanking and get enjoyment out of helping people and always giving your best while being super reliable?  
---
or  
---
Do you want to be the MT because you want an important title and a lot of shiny loot? 
---
Being the main tank (in a hardcore/semi-hc guild) is basically a full-time job (at least early on) in addition to whatever else you got going on in your life. Most of the other posts mention that it is a lot of work and you will get some support from the guild but also need to go beyond what everyone else is bringing.  
---
Yes you will get gear first but you will get it as gear: tools to make your work in paving  your guild''s path more efficient. Not for showing it off in orgrimmar. 
---
Source: I'm main offtank in a semi-hc vanilla guild. I am basically expected to bring the same amount of effort and performance our mt does, albeit with a slightly different role during fights, minus the administrative and raid leading work our mt does. I have also main tanked and raid lead plenty of times in smaller raids or when the MT wasn't able to make it, which happens nearly never but adds up over several vanilla and tbc servers.  
---
It is not always easy and it is a lot of hard work and it definitely isn't the right thing for everyone.
---
Yeast mastery 
---
Good point
---
I find it hard to "recruit" before the game even launch. But I'll take a look.
---
Multiboxing is banned on icecrown except for  one guy who has like a hundred characters and bought gear on all of em.
---
Chill bro
---
nvm wrong reddit
---
Joined mid-TBC (shortly after BT was released), left on Cataclysm when heroics got the nerf hammer, becoming as mindless as wotlk ones. 
---
This nerf along the changes in the world (which I disliked), class changes (at the time I was an enh shaman, searing flames mechanic was such a nuisance and easy to deal with PvP-wise) and already being disappointed with LFG (which I still hate). 
---
It became a chore so it was time to quit. And it feels like I saw LFR was to come... 
---
I think they made the rep change during WotLK to make it so you got full rep even if quests were grey, but before it wasn't like that.
---
Jump on a private server man. Heaps of fun and a good primer for Classic.
---
What kind of crayon is it? I might be interested!
---
You might be surprised, I have seen a few guild websites and recruitment posts. I am sort of looking for a semi-hardcore raid guild myself US-East-PVP that I can raid with alongside my workschedule.
---
I smile inwards when people speak of clearing mc and naxx in one sentence.
---
 I tried naxx back in the days but we never ever made it past Thaddius. It was certain that we would never ever down the 4 horsemen. We did not have that many tanks.
---
So watch out, it will get VERY hard, nothing in comparison to molten core. The fun ends at aq40...
---
I honestly wouldn't even bother with the re-sub until Classic comes out. I did the same with the intention of just messing around and it just tainted me, the game I used to love was reduced to a pathetic collectors game, where your hand is held every step of the way. Went to a private server and fell back in love with Vanilla.
---
With unified Auction houses, do they mean across servers or across cities? I quite liked being able to see all the server I was on had to offer in my &lt;favorite city&gt; without having to travel to &lt;hub city&gt;. For some reason I also remember that being part of vanilla, but it's been so long...
---
This would make for an interesting writing prompt 
---
&gt;Watched some BWL logs, every healer had 33 to 50% of overhealing. Druid had ~66% of overhealing. On bosses.
---
From what I remember, good healers can pull off around 20% overhealing. Regardless, there will always be situations where you're not overhealing. In those situations, +healing will be beneficial. On the other hand, if you can avoid going oom (which you can with pots and runes), mp5 is essentially useless.
---
&gt;Good luck if you take fire lord, mageblade...
---
Fire Lord I agree with, Mageblade is absolutely possible. 
---
&gt;Lifegiver is like 0.5% drop rate, cant even remember if i have ever seen it in private servers.
---
Lifegiver has the same droprate as other random non-set stuff like Manastorm Leggings, Salamander Scale Pants, Heavy Dark Iron Ring or Robe of Volatile Power. 6-7% chance on Gehennas, Shazzrah, Lucifron and Sulfuron Harbinger. 
---
&gt;you might get 2nd cautering band if you get 12+ of those to drop, right ?
---
Depends on the loot system. I've had two Cauterizing Bands when I was running MC with a guild that used DKP.
---
And i feel like caring about this is toxic
---
Honestly when will people buckle up and get past  some people being mean? If you stop giving a shit it's not an issue anymore
---
Also, the second this sentiment becomes the general consensus within a game's community, is when it starts going to shit. You so often see frail people being afraid of toxicity, also being the people who cry for the design philosophy retail is adhering to. Im sick and tired of "these players" ruining the games i like
---
Than can also REMOVE the system entirely. It saves 100% of the GM costs related to loot.
---
Loot trading doesn't save any costs, GM's will be pummeled by thousands of tickets everyday, from people ASSUMING that 3 guys colluded on rolls.
---
The problem here is actually that WE DO NOT KNOW how the loot trading will actually work. And it is not our fault, is Activision-Blizzard INABILITY to communicate.
---
What the hell is so hard for them Activision-Blizzard to tell us HOW EXACTLY they want loot trading to work in Classic?
---
It won't be for greed, that is 100% sure, because GREED have ZERO influence in ninja looting. If it will be for NEED, Classic is basically DONE. The impact will be devastating on the community.
---
If it will be for MASTER LOOT ONLY, and in RAIDS only, well, that is something we can all be happy with.
---
But they didn't said ANYTHING CONCRETE about loot trading yet. Just some mambo-jambo "sorry ninjas" etc.
---
Totally agree with all of this. I think if they kept the game in Azeroth and never added flying mounts, the game would have held it's playerbase better. With each expansion there were good and bad things, but a consistent issue was that community was fragmented after flying/new worlds. 
---
Loot in retail is IRRELEVANT. I guess this is breaking news for you?
---
TBC is probably worse than Classic in[ that regard](https://i.imgur.com/7C3FKYh.jpg) though. 
---
Well, think a little bit more than 10 seconds.
---
From my experience, you will have two goals.
---
First get a core group together. 
---
Second get two officers that really support you. Never try to be gm and raid leader at the same time. 
---
You are going to be stressed if you don't delegate. 
---
Imo you have to be prepared to throw people out that don't fit in. 
---
That is something a lot of people can't and won't do. But someone who is unfriendly and always late etc. 
---
They have to go. Your reputation as a guild is something important. 
---
Recruitment can be whisper, recruiting after dungeons, in reddit, official forums. 
---
There is a lot you can do, just don't spam official trade channels, you might annoy people who want to trade. 
---
Just be ready to do a lot of work, be prepared for tons of whispers and that everything is your fault.
---
It's a thankless job. 
---
Protection is less good for tanking below 60 than arms is. Just doesn't have the threat generation. :D That said, glhf.
---
i think they mean everything which is used to autmate invites. 
---
vQueue just informs you about a chat message which should be fine. I think its exactly where they intend to draw the line. Can't know for sure, of course.
---
Literally A SHITLOADS of difference. The negative impact of 10 ninja dudes / server (no loot trading) vs. 50 groups x 3 ninja dudes /server is clearly very different.
---
Blacklist is 50 spots only. Works on 10 ninja idiots (no loot trading). Doesn't when you deal with 200 ninja idiots (with loot trading).
---
Also, literally, you having a brain or not, is no difference.
---
I sold mine when Legion released for $5,500. It’s amazing what people are willing to pay for those pets. 
---
we've seen it. its a very discouraging post, if you know the subject. 4 stages content, loot trading, 16 debuff molten core, etc. 
---
and they are proud of it. loot trading is amazing!!! in bracket "Sorry ninja looters!" 
---
we are so good, we arent giving you unlimited debuff but 16 debuffs! we are amazing!!!
---
and so on.. they have no idea.
---
the worst part of TBC imo was the way quests were all clumped together in hubs.  It stopped feeling organic and spontaneous and started feeling like a checklist of chores.
---
The biggest part is being online A LOT, especially if you're going to lead AND MT. People in the guild need to see you as reliable.
---
The auction houses were linked in patch 1.9.
---
The joke
---
.
---
You
---
Minus toxicity.
---
Neither is your brain.
---
I get that it won't be the same as 'launch WoW' but the debuff limit was increased during the lifespan of Vanilla. It's hard to argue against its inclusion at the beginning of Classic.
---
Sure, MC will be much easier but that alone won't affect much else afterward. 
---
That's very true, even fury with Flurry is better. But as I'm in for the long haul, I'm gonna make it a challenge for my self  ;) 
---
Ah, yeah, I forgot Crusader Strike was in TBC, probably because of its ridiculous 10 second cooldown back then. I did play as Ret in TBC initially, but I remember it being quite underwhelming in raids and I was asked to tank instead, which I ended up enjoying a lot. Unfortunately, I never enjoyed tanking after TBC, I really liked the unique Paladin tanking in that expansion. Wrath, on the other hand, was THE time to be Ret, especially early on in the expansion, Ret was ridiculously OP, along with Death Knights.
---
# druid
---
so, basically, tank + healer + dps in one.
---
At some point I'll likely respec into balance and level a bit in balance, just for fun. I remember back then, when it was already well-known that balance druids aren'T worth anything, and... I temporarily switched to balance for fun, because respec was at 10g and I thought it's a waste that respec price isn't diminishing, so I respeced. And then, was running on foot, moonkin foot, probably from mob to mob, or something. Then, on my way... I COMPLETELY ACCIDENTALLY crossed my ways with not one moonkin, but TWO MOONKINS coming from TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, so not grouped up, and then we teamted up, a party of THREE MOONKINS that ACCIDENTALLY met eachother at the same time, and we teamed up against one HORDE MOONKIN that was lurking around
---
after that event, I'd decided I'd keep playing balance... but in the end, I switched to restoration after all...
---
How do people play MMORPGs now? I'm genuinely interested, haven't played one since WoW.
---
Tought you ment raid leader, he is worried half the guild will quit instandly. But my friends didn't played back than and dont understand my hype.
---
Try Kargoz and Tipsout, they're much more mature and less "hellacious nerd".
---
Loot trading has been in the game since 3.2.0. Has loot been irrelevant since then? 
---
Lmao. Do people like you actually exist?
---
A blue sword with 20 dps vs a green sword with 14 dps, at lvl 20-ish is a MASSIVE downtime while leveling. And that is only for ONE ITEM.
---
How the hell can you not understand that saving TIME is important, regardless what are you doing...INCLUDING LEVELING ?
---
And better gear HELPS A LOT with leveling speed?
---
Since its a shared payment classic people could play the classic opening event on retail. 
---
Also the classic opening even could be for below level 20 so free to play.
---
But something would be fun.
---
I joined in April 2005, left for the first time toward the end of TBC, then again toward the end of Wrath.  I was a progression raider for the first three expansions before quitting seriously toward the end of Wrath (Trial of Grand Champs).  I came back to see the shattering but left before reaching 85, lasting less than 14 days in Cataclysm and about 9 days before quitting Mists of Pandaria.  I lasted a lot longer in WoD and managed to level up about 10 characters to 100, then got about 6 to 110 in legion and so far only 4 to 120in BFA.  I'm currently letting my subscription expire for BFA as I stopped playing over xmas and dont feel like playing catch up again.
---
Honestly, classic WoW is the only MMO i want to play.  I've tried dozens of other MMOs from Rift and Guild Wars to DDO and Age of Conan and even ESO... my hearts just not in it.  Vanilla WOW did so much right, i love it, warts and all.
---
vQueue is a shit addon, but more sophisticated addons can easily be created. For example you could create a LFG addon (minus the teleport to dungeon part obviously) if you wanted to, then again you could do that in vanilla too...if you wanted to.
---
Thanks I think I needed this. Now I am just stuck on what I should reroll. I was leveling a Pally on a classic private server, not sure if I should start that again. The rotation wasn't that fun to play but I did enjoy healing. Maybe I'll roll undead rogue. Who knows.
---
Classic being authentic went out the window the second they decided on 1.12.
---
1.12 talents and class balance nerf MC more than 16 debuff slots could ever do so the experience is already ruined, a few more debuffs won't change that.
---
the fact that in their internal tests they were surprised about feeding hunter pets or buying ammo gives the hint that these guys haven't played vanilla WoW since 2004-2006.
---
Meaning they probably don't understand the intricacies as well as the hardcore vanilla fans that played on Nost/Lights Hope/private servers.
---
&gt; Also the classic opening even could be for below level 20 so free to play
---
well, I was thinking that it should definitely not require anything above level 60, so long-unsubbed players would be able to come back and do it.
---
Meaning they probably don't understand the intricacies as well as the hardcore vanilla fans that played on priv servers
---
While you're in that timeline, please buy me a Black Lotus!
---
I agree, I would like to see mythic and LFR gone and just have normal and heroic and heroic being mythic difficulty.
---
2 difficulties is enough. 1 being flex 10-30 people and the other 20 fixed.
---
If you look at legion as a collector. Doing 4 diffrent mode's isn't fun. And as raider it ain't fun eighter.
---
I tested it on classic demo already and weightstones do not increase your shapeshifted damage, as they shouldn't
---
My understanding from the presentation at blizzcon was that it was a technical limitation. They weren’t able to decide when to have it 1.12 or otherwise, they had to trace back to the earliest thing they possibly could? I may be wrong here but that’s what I thought. 
---
wake up, neo
---
If Blizzard see this they'll be putting them back into production and creating thousands of EBay accounts.
---
Greedy bastards. 
---
You wouldn't even have to buy it. Back then you could mine 50 coins yourself with your PC. It would be pure profit!
---
Use &lt;RS&gt; to look around
---
Haha, that’s epic OP. 
---
My favorite memory was when I was running to catch the boat in Menethil Harbor at low level. And a druid came out of nowhere next to me and turned into a cheetah and made the jump onto the boat just before it left the dock. 
---
I missed the boat. But I didn’t care. I was just in total awe at this druid who just used the game mechanics to catch the boat. 
---
Even if he was only around level 32-38, I thought this dude was the coolest motherfucker I had ever seen. 
---
&gt; From what I remember, good healers can pull off around 20% overhealing. 
---
It absolutely depends on how many healers you have, what kind of gear and what kind of guild you are in. When every healer is running all possible world buffs, literally spamming the whole time... you wont see 20% overheals (on alliance side).
---
If you would just do least amount of overhealing, you would also do least amount of healing. Because of mass spam. With good bwl gear and fast kill times you can spamheal max rank flash from first second to boss dying, literally not missing a global and not have to use a single mana pot.
---
As you always start with "from what i remember", i suspect that you are thinking how things used to work. Yeah, then you played a lot differently. Im saying what things are now. In the sub 30min MC nonskip runs. Most bosses dying in 15-60 seconds.

In the same vein, The occassional 'Scare yeast' will make your pet and longbearded dwarves really respect you.

&gt;To hype classic for the retail crowd?

as I said in my response, to hype classic crowd, and also, to make classic crowd resub earlier.
---
im curious to see if spell damage effects dragonbreath chili. apperntly its suppose to in vanilla as it was changed in tbc. flask of supreme power + dragonbreath chili would be good dps on feral druid 
---
I think they would've settled on 1.12 regardless because it makes a lot of things easier in development, but yes, it's true that during Blizzcon they said that they have complete 1.12 data but not everything from before that.

I personaly dont like the look of those new models and the animation. But for those that are into them there is a workaround. On Private server that run with original 1.12 client people using WoD modells, only those that use the mod can see the modells. I personaly prefer the original Animation and models.

Probably they mean unified auction house across factions.

Well, i like it. It doesnt make any automated grouping, i dont have to constantly check that chat. Its exactly on the level i want it to be.

or wait, you mean that Darkshore...

I have a similar story however from a pserver. 
---
I leveled as an elemental shaman from lvl 39-60. I quested in STV and stumbled upon an alliance boomkin at the troll area in the middle of the map and I targeted him and typed /duel.
---
We fought with our cool pewpew lazermagic until I had him down to 1HP and won the duel. I was about to /cheer when my dumb searing totem with its 5year old vanilla scripting immediately rekt him.   
---
I /cry'ed over his body and logged onto my lvl 20 gnome rogue and apologised. I felt really bad. :(

&gt;It absolutely depends on how many healers you have, what kind of gear and what kind of guild you are in. When every healer is running all possible world buffs, literally spamming the whole time... you wont see 20% overheals (on alliance side).
---
Speedruns want as few healers as possible. Less healers=less overhealing.
---
&gt;With good bwl gear and fast kill times you can spamheal max rank flash from first second to boss dying, literally not missing a global and not have to use a single mana pot.
---
And if you use mana pots, you can focus your gear on +healing instead of mp5 and every heal that isn't an overheal will be stronger.
---
&gt;As you always start with "from what i remember", i suspect that you are thinking how things used to work.
---
Nah, I'm thinking of how things worked when I played a few years ago on a private server.
---
All in all, there's really no way to refute that if 
---
1)It is possible to never oom without focusing on mp5 gear.
---
2)Some of your heals will not be overheals.
---
then stacking +healing is better than going for mp5.
---
Dailies is a big part of why I quit mid TBC. I came back towards the end to prepare for WoTLK though. 
---
I had something similar happening on a zeppelin. But I just jumped even though the access to the zep was already mid air. I flew and landed on a sandbag attached to its side on the rear. Obviously I didnt dare do move anymore as I rightfully expected to sit on one pixel of texture. 
---
Did one key stroke after getting to my destination and fell off.
---
&gt; And actually yes, there is FOR SURE times where AV would bea thing.
---
Shows how much you know 
---
haha pardon my retail reference, but reminds me of doing quests in Draenor on day one. There was a quest to collect some things underwater, and as you  may have guessed, sharding was broken, because transfer aborted, instance not found.
---
And, this quest was required in order to create a garrison and proceed.
---
So, imagine all that crowd, and only druids making progress.
---
anyway, my memories aobut the Menethil Harbor boat are basically sitting at the boat for 30 minutes and waiting for it to set out.
---
It was the stationary boat, you know, that was parked there.
---
I’m okay with all of this as long as sharding isn’t in the game 
---
&gt; 5year old vanilla scripting immediately rekt him
---
you mean post-duel death to DoTs?
---
Ah, damn. That sounds like a drag, lol. I didn’t play much retail after Cata tbh. 
---
&gt; anyway, my memories aobut the Menethil Harbor boat are basically sitting at the boat for 30 minutes and waiting for it to set out.
---
Lmao!! I did this too 😂👌🏻!
---
And the confusion of which boat went where. Heck, back then my favorite thing was primairly exploring. 
---
A [flurry axe] dropped off a random world mob in Arathi Highlands. Here's the cool part, I was leveling a protection pally. I used that axe all the way up to Hellfire Peninsula.
---
Most likely not. SC2 will not get this veteran like status. Just like not every old car is valuable.
---
Dude take your fucking meds. 
---
I distinctly remember being at a card shop with a few hundred bucks to spend where they had a handful of alpha/beta Black Lotus on display for $50 each.  I considered, but decided against buying a couple.  Woulda been the down payment I’m about to make on a house.  Ah well, my mom probably would have sent them through the wash with my alpha dual lands anyway.
---
Ah, a connaisseur of duel deaths, I see!
---
$6,000 to find out ded game is ded?! 
---

---
The reliance on others, the effort it took to assemble a group, and how that impacted your journey into a dungeon—these were all part of the classic experience that we wanted to preserve.
---
Many decisions we made were fairly clear cut. Things like Dungeon Finder were clearly a “no.” So were things like cross-realm grouping, the achievement system, unified auction houses, and flying.
---
In-game mail between guildmates now is instant, but in the past, it had a 1-hour delay, just like mail between strangers. The change to instant mail made things more convenient, but removed the social interaction of having to meet up with someone to make a transaction if you wanted something sooner. So we’ve reintroduced that delay for that reason.
---
It is quite clear that they understand the concerns of the community. Yes Blizzard has disappointed / turned his vest in the past. But did they do so while clearly stating things like they did in this very detailled post? I don't think so.
---
There are good reasons to think 1) they won't lie on any of this and 2) they are working on remaining issues like sharding and loot trading, and will do what is possible if the community ask it enough.
---
Me and some guildies were by the horde base in thousand needles, I forget the name of it off the top of my head. Somehow we got the idea that we should jump off the top and try to catch eachother  with spells. It didn't work. Lots of deaths and lost of laughs. I don't know why but it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen, and we just kept trying! I have the video on my old hard drive, maybe I'll upload it one day.
---
Another time as alliance we rolled up to SFK and a single Tauren was there, he got spooked and accidentally backpedaled off the bridge and plummeted to his death. We all laughed, I got that on video too.
---
Falling to death must tickle my funny bone.
---
&gt; Probably they mean unified auction house across factions.
---
That is definitely not what they mean.
---
I cancelled my subscription shortly after BfA launched. It just doesn't feel like a good expansion and I can't even explain why. But it is the first expansion that I will not have a max lvl character in. Stopped at 119 due to boredom.
---
Is Heart of the Wild healing bad?
---
My first Onyxia raid was on my 18th birthday, the raid sang happy birthday on vent, my t2 helmet dropped and I got the bag too.  
---
    
---
Best raid ever.
---
Ariving the Gurubashi Arena at the right time without knowing what was there. Looked empty but goblin said some stuff and dropped a chest. I was I was alone and went for it. Got oneshottes by a 60 rogue. Went back to my corpse and saw 2 rogues fighting eachother. I just stood there and watched while a group of 6-8 people all jumped in on mounts. I didn't had a mount yet and it looked so cool. After watching them all fight for 10isch minutes one of the rogue's looted it and everyone was mad at him. Once they left I knew for sure. Later someday... I would be the winner of the arena.
---
5 years later...
---
Somewhere in wrath I farmed the 12 victories for the achievment. 
---
My hunter once just barely made the jump onto the ship to Theramore before it left. That was a cool feeling. 
---
Picture the scenario.
---
You go to a cave full of yetis. You kill them until you are done for your quest and you know you wont go back there ever. Maybe in 40 levels to help some lowbie guildie. 
---
So chances are slim you will have a chance to reloot this specific chest. 
---
Now I also know that it's highly infuriating when I leave a delicious cave mold in there, going on my merry way.
---
Didnt you like my delicious cave mold?
---
Making it to STV on a warrior.........
---
I was 9. 
---
Amazing.
---
&gt; Speedruns want as few healers as possible. Less healers=less overhealing.
---
Well, we arent doing speedruns for the best time, we need those heals in AQ/NAXX and if you start putting them on the bench just because you want to shave off few minutes of your time... 
---
When i keep hitting that 50% overheal mark i might as well save on potion usage and get some mp5 going. And on boss fights press that magic button to change my gear. 
---
Would it kill you loot the entire damn thing and just destroy the items you don't need? It would take you 5-10 seconds to do it. Even if your bags are full surely there's one piece of junk you could get rid of to make room for other items. Even like this it wouldn't take you more than 30 seconds to clear it all and you'd do a good deed that helps your fellow faction members.
---
Blood Fury leaves your orc character with a temporary Lethargy debuff. 
---
I remmeber being on that quest for more than an hour with general chat filled with rage.
---
Very true. SO very true. 
---
I left when my guild benched me on 10/11 mythic Argus. I was getting burned and it gave me the impetus I needed to leave. Never played BFA. After a hiatus of several months I picked up Final Fantasy XIV and have gotten that same feeling I used to get from WoW. The new world to explore. New classes to learn. The four man content in interesting especially tanking with a 2.5 second GCD. Give it a try it may fill an itch until classic comes. 
---
I bought both WoD and Legion when it was brandnew, played 3 levels on each game and called it. It was just not the same anymore for me. 
---
I got really, really excited seeing the rare elites in WoD only to solo them. I felt so sad. 
---
In Legion I mindlessly grinded my through the hightauren area with these weird round lizard thingis to then go to the viking area. On the way a blue quest item went purple by chance, I didnt even see that and when I was killing tentacles in the viking area without knowing whats going on, I ditched it once again.
---
No heart anymore, I tell you.
---
You own it!  Nice work! 
---
&gt; Somehow we got the idea that we should jump off the top and try to catch eachother with spells
---
you mean, like starfall, or /duel and stun/root?
---
&gt;  I have the video on my old hard drive, maybe I'll upload it one day.
---
360p?
---
Joined in early January 2006, quit retail for good in November 2016. 
---
&gt; And the confusion of which boat went where too, lol
---
at some point, I learned to talk to the &lt;Dockmaster&gt; NPC
---
HEY HEY HEEEEEEYYYYY
---
I sometimes do that because when I reach the chest my bags are already full with quest items and I hardly find something to throw away to make place for the green/pot I could find in there
---
Wow yeah, I did the exact same thing. Also only made it to 119. I was pretty happy with BFA the first few weeks, but I cancelled my sub by the end of the month. I was already super unhappy seeing how upgrading gear was going, and more table missions, AoE faceroll sessions in dungeons and questing etc. I just couldn't justify to keep playing and lying to myself that it might be fun eventually.
---
Sucks, because I had 4 other real close friends to do mythics with and stuff but that isn't all I want to do in wow, and that's basically all it has to offer me for my interests. 
---
I know I dont mind it happening to me, because I just genuinely laugh about such skullduggery.
---
The chance of me fighting through a horde of mobs to be played by some other douche, or maybe you lucked out and a kind soul actually looted it all. 
---
But I'm not that kind soul. I find it funny. :(
---
just go back to 1993 and buy every single MTG card from the power 9 for less then a dolar.
---
I have an irrational dislike for boss kill guide videos.
---
It feels like the more info and the more breakdown the raids get, the more of the magic is lost and becomes more like labwork.
---
Could anyone help me change my mind on this? I know it's not rational.
---
This. My semi-casual-Molten-Core-all-day guild geared up so many MTs/OTs for other guilds.  After we saw our 5th Thunderfury (we were pretty lucky with bindings) leave for a better guild a lot of people called it quits.
---
The gearing was retarded... I kept my legendary pants on my rogue through 119 simply because the bonus outweighed the stats of newer gear. Azerite gear sucks. I hate AoE grinding. I hate being the uber champion of the world... Along with every other player in the game... And I hate almost never seeing the same people over and over. 
---
Vanilla servers are where it's at, and where I will be until Classic launch.
---
I never only loot greens/potions. I loot almost everything, leaving just the most useless cheap item in it. Just for you bud.
---
This reminds me of ARK when players would only loot half a beaver dam.
---
Since I was a huge fan of Warcraft 2 and 3, It was amazing to see all the notable places from a different perspective and to explore them even if I was 20 levels lower than the mobs in that zone. But for some reason, the most memorable moment was when I was going from Coldridge valley to Kharanos and bumped into mortar team (Angus and Shorty) practicing their shooting lol.
---
We.aint.got.no.life!
---
Yell at them haha
---
Sounds like something I might do on purposs. But I'm a badboy...
---
While I agree with you in theory, Blizzard doesn't. 
---
They've already been presented with this dilemma before, and for 14 years have stuck to trying to milk the $25 transfer fee rather than offer a reasonable free service. And frankly, they probably look at it as, "players will either pay $25 to transfer, or will pay $15*6 to level up another character on a different server, so win win!"
---
Nap - when stealthed rogues can just take a nap, it heals them to full and removed debuff. They also feel refreshed with more energy.
---
Our progression MT was the GM and Raid Leader, I think that's why he died before 40...  Everything in moderation folks!
---
I'm sure your warchief is proud of you, filthy Horde savage.
---
They tried these kinds of restrictions originally (as noted in the article OP posted) but at least anecdotally from what I remember, they more or less completely failed. They were basically offering transfers off of healthy servers onto a server where you may be 1 out of 100 level 60's on your faction. No one had any reason to take such a terrible offer, and when they did, not enough other players accepted it to make it worthwhile.
---
The only solution is going to be forced server mergers - anything that requires the players to opt in is going to fail, because everyone likes to be IMBA. 
---
Sack Stab - the highest damage move in a Rogue's arsenal
---
I intentionally do this just to make people like you mad!   Get Jebaited noob! 
---
Why would my brain be on the table 
---
So what you're saying is...
---
Its assumed that cloth quests turn ins will be available from the start with classic as its in the 1.12 base game state.
---
The best strategy is to immediately go to death knell and silverpine and do EVERY quest for the under city rep.
---
Just pull up a wiki and check off every quest that gives global horde or under city rep while leveling (before they turn gray preferably).
---
The second assumption is that in classic based off 1.12, all quests also give some global faction rep on top of the city rep the quest giver is aligned to. If that is the case, you should reach exalted right round late 50's when you're wrapping up the plaguelands.
---
Yep it’s always been the people that make or break a game for me, the game itself is just a platform where you interact with others 
---
What class are you going to play in classic? I’d be curious to know, it’s a bit unusual to have a bfa player with fresh eyes here! (Even a BC vet like you)
---
I'm so glad to know that people like you'll be there to ruin WoW Classic. Really warms the heart, you know.
---
I never stated that I died. I ran there to explore Ashenvale to put it simple.
---
wat
---
Noooo
---
Haha relax I’m just teasing you. I do sometimes have too full bags to take everything though
---
No
---
You only get full rep and xp if they at least green when passed in. For every level outside the appropriate range, these quests will start to return less xp AND rep. You cannot go back to the starter zones and do the level 4 quests to get any decent amount of rep.
---
I was obsessed with the Fiery Waraxe.  
---
According to the item database I used at the time Colonel Kurzen had the highest chance to drop it.
---
in the end I ran into the cave way too many times until I finally gave up on it.  
---
then, while helping a friend do the quests there it really did drop.  
---
even though I was 42 already I still equipped it.  
---
no regrets
---
I agree. Vanilla to Wrath is the peak of the game. If it were up to me I would have split Vanilla/TBC/Wrath from Cata/MoP/WoD/Legion/BfA into two separate games like Guild Wars 1 and 2. The only change I would make is that I never would have introduced the Dungeon Finder towards the end of Wrath. Only thing I didn’t like about otherwise my favorite expansion. 
---
Oh definitely undead mage, but if I could get my hands on the beta/alpha I’d like to go gnome (lock?) just to give alliance a try.
---
I’ve been subbed to this reddit for about a year now, long time lurker. Just not much to say because I was focused on repeating the same content 3 times a week trying to get cutting edge 😂.  If I have to see any legion raid again, or uldir content Ima puke. Still didn’t get CE this xpac. 
---
If a quest is 1 or 2 levels turning gray,  you will still get decent rep returns. Doing a quest that is 10 levels beyond turning gray will deminish to garbage.
---
once touched chests despawn if empty or after a few minutes

[NA-Central] Horde *RP-PvP(or PvP) name to be determined. *Not super into RP.
---
Hello everyone. My brother and I have been playing wow since the summer of 2005. We have experience on retail as well as private servers. Our idea of fun is using teamwork to dominate world pvp and breeze through raids.
---
This guild will be focused primarily on world pvp during the first few months with weekly raids on alliance cities and hotspots. Since most players will want to focus on leveling, Wednesday nights will be reserved for organized pvp. Although chances are on any given night you will find people to pvp with. A certain well known server released information that stated it took the average player around 250 hours to reach level 60. That's roughly between 3-4 months playing around 15-20 hours per week which we believe is the sweet spot for people like us. We have jobs, families, and respect things like exercise and not pooping into socks. If that sounds like you, you're one of us.
---
Once we have enough of a core group to start raiding Wednesday's will be a raid night as well as either Tuesday's and\or Thursday's depending on popularity.
---
Loot will be distributed based on a contribution point system for non set pieces, and loot council for set pieces. Loot council will be elected each season by the members of each role(healer, melee[+hunters], and ranged). This allows players that are capable of contributing the most to the guild to see the most return while also avoiding loot council corruption.
---
If anyone is interested let me know. The discord is up and bot is running, guild documents are just about done, however most of our recruitment will be done in game.
---
I feel relieved that I left during Legion after seeing all of the negativity, bad press and controversy I’ve seen about BFA. 
---
Best tip i can give is voice chat. Make a guild discord server or something and try to get all members to join. This is the best way to make people stay in your guild. A grp of strangers is easy to leave but you wont leave a bunch of friends.
---
Yes
---
Nah man, I ran a 5 man party at WotLK launch on a very mediocre desktop and had no problems. If graphics stay the same as OG vanilla then anything bought within the last 5 years is golden.
---
They are nice pets. I have them and it’s cool because diablo isn’t affected by the lighting engine and is like never in shadow. He also is the only pet with a title below his name 
---
I have no problem with someone typing out their thoughts online. This isn’t a final paper, it’s a post on a website. Why does this upset you so much?
---
Yeah no online game can seem to fill this empty void that Vanilla filled for me. I like Guild Wars 2 and all but I’m just not invested or fully interested in it like Vanilla. 
---
Start with the trash and work yourself up to the things you want to keep.
---
Are you sure? I was looking at that chest for almost half an hour while going around collecting plants, eggs and spider legs. Didn't see kill the furbolgs so I'm pretty sure nobody looted it in that time frame. Maybe it's a private server issue then.
---
Part of the addiction for me when I played wow when I was in my teens was not having much money and so I tried to make the most of my sub, knowing it’s cost and not knowing if I could be able to have it month to month. It definitely made me feel highly compelled to play. 
---
Being younger you have less self control and the ability to do the same shit over and over again without getting bored. Now I have much more discipline with it and just play it to relax and zone out. I even have ways of grinding mobs while running on the treadmill to stay in shape. I just love classic wow. 
---
When I return I feel all the same shit I did when I was a kid even though it’s a fairly simple version of the game it does everything so tastefully that I’m always in shock. Simplicity of design can be very powerful if used correctly. 
---
Early after release, running to Astranaar on my NE Priest, 3 Horde (Orc) questing nearby start to chase me.  They hit me with a few damages but nothing renew and bubble cant prevent.   Get to the bridge and guards, Orcs stop and /point /chicken at me over and over staying out of range of the guards.  I move close to the bridge targetting the closest one, tapping W until Mind Control gets in range.  Take control of him, run him into Astranaar, and let him go.  He dies quickly under the swarm of guards.   His friends /clap /bow /laugh until the fallen orc returns.  They wave and run off into the forest.
---
Also, in Beta, spawning beside crypt in the Undead start area after the loading narrative.  First time logging in, excited.  Two undead run past me, the first one /train "choo choo" and the second one /lol right after.   I knew I was home.
---
My wife and I are looking for a guild much as you. She will be playing a priest and I a warlock or warrior. Depending on what guild needs I’ll go prot(Tauren) or orc(fury) or ranged dps.
---
Like you we are looking for NA/pve/horde/ looking to raid.
---
We want an EST based server assuming they go that route. Raid like 3 times a week, 7-10pm.
---
Thursday would be the only day that conflicts with our schedules.
---
Hate those people. Had the crazy thought of how cool it would be if chests contents increased in rarity the longer they remained unlooted. 
---
I'm going to level resto/balance and this made my day. I'll remember this when I feel like tearing my hair out, OP!
---
You just didn't raid. 1.12 talents and itemization makes MC, Ony and even a bit of BWL extremely trivialized 
---
There's always that one item which is worth next to nothing you can get rid off. Hearthstone is on a 47 minute cooldown and you're going to town anyway? Destroy it and make room for that new junk! I've done this plenty of times.
---
I think a lot of my most unexpected memorable moments happened in Ashenvale as I was leveling there for the first time. It was where I saw my first Alliance, some NE with a red name tag that scared the crap out of me knowing that person could turn on me at any given moment. So of course, me and my friend went hostile on him and scared him off, sending him back into the woods.
---
Also saw one of those huge forest giants for the first time when it somehow snuck up on me and my friend and smashed his ass while in bear form as I ran away.
---
I always have full bags so I'd only take the good stuff, sorry :(
---
I tried that recently on a pserver.
---
It's actually very decent, lots of extra procs, especially if you have a weapon enchant.
---
Get extra parry chance instead of imp.HS, more durability/damage, overpower procs, rage generation...
---
Fury warriors are the worst! I would rather be in a guild with warriors who like to tank and let them dps than a person who rolled warrior with the sole purpose of dpsing. On average, they are better players and tend to watch their threat better too. 
---
The original battle royale game lol
---
You see that those 3 bear paws sitting in your backpack? That's a silver and a few coppers you can sacrifice for the greater good. Be honorable and do the right thing.
---
haha that's just me with the zeppelin to Northrend
---
Do you make BM hunter first because you like them or because they are so efficient at lvling and it will help speed up your subsequent characters?
---
no, a warlock
---
Yeah cause THAT is the one thing that will 100% for sure RUIN Classic...
---
war\*
---
I agree. Speaking as a warrior who love tanking and fury dps equally.
---
And you can just disable pfui unitframes and use like luna for that part if you like.
---
insulting people doesn't help your point, grow up
---
Almost the exact situation here. My guild just cleared Patchwerk before BC was scheduled to release. We ran hundreds of MC, saw 7 of one binding and never the second. After BC was released, it finally dropped when a few guildies pugd it at 70.
---
I was talking about his attitude. If too many people think like that and do things which actively make the game harder for your fellow players like refusing to invite them for a group quest even tho you have room in the party then yes, history will repeat itself and the game will be ruined.

**Guild Name and location**
---
&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance
---
**Language**
---
English
---
**Guild Type**
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive. 
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, and hopefully realm first, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we only need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay. 
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule** (GMT+1)
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
During new content release we expect to raid when servers open up
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!

Gears boring. Jobs are all just a different rotation. Content is locked behind a verrrrrry long story mission (though for some that could be a good thing, I just didn’t want decidedly linear progression forced into me) just Very little for me. It was decently fun through the 40’s and 50’s and the areas are beautiful. It just fell... flat 
---
Yes this too. Earthbind kiting will allow you to solo quests you thought you needed a group for. A few quests i soloed doing this was negolash, the captains chest, and king muglash or w.e all in stv. With some dream weave gear, eagle gear and nature’s wrath gear you can solo many things as elemental lvling at 40+. Ele mastery is really good to take at this time because it’s absolutely amazing in low level pvp, and helps if you wanna burst down three mobs with shooting lbs at three mobs, gather, fire nova, ele mastery, chainlightning, then either magma totem/lightning shield/more lightning bolts if you have eye of the storm procced (or just sit and get the proc, not sure if this will work in classic but does for private servers). Now go blow some shit up 
---
You can't be serious. I've healed plenty of BRD runs with full boomkin spec. 
---
Just no. Blizz talked about taking parts of vanilla LUA out of the game (parts that arent in legion) and that they wont put all thats in legion LUA into classic. So its a hybrid between the two of those.
---
Meaning both vanilla AND legion addons will require some work.
---
They did mention they want to take any automated actions addons away, im thinking one button healing addons doing downranking and target selection + decursive addons. So most likely those you wont see in classic at all, but unitframes mods etc we will see for sure.
---
It was god awful. 90% of stuff just went on thr Org/IF AH and the rest where empty.
---
Trying to find things on the TB one...
---
Worthless food item...
---
Clearly you don't play warrior my dear chap!
---
The more I played BFA the more excited I am for Classic. I even created my hunter again in a certain place and walked around the starting zone just imagining summer 2019. I've never played Vanilla, started in TBC, so I think this is going to be an incredible experience to me. I'm so sick of modern Wow is not even fun.
---
Personally I hate achievements, and I'm really glad they're not added to Classic. They add a meta progression layer to the game that can (and for me does) take away some of my enjoyment. If it can be disabled, I might be alright with it, but otherwise definitely not.
---
I always ran to the STV horde zep tower while pulling all guards. Wait as ghost untill the zep started moving and than released in the lower level of the zeppelin hoping they would not find me. Thats the fastest way to SM as alliance.
---
No thanks
---
Bm hunter is in general really good vs. bad players.
---
Did anyone else try to click on the other images of the box? Yeah, me neither...
---
Now i'm going to take all the good items and ***DELETE*** THEM MUHAHAHAHAHA!
---
Now that's awkward.
---
Nope, haven't played Warrior in vanilla but I am thinking about play a Night Elf. Charging at a Horde player from stealth seems like fun.
---
Rushing, auto piloting and soloing through the leveling process. Cutting as many corners as possible to level quickly. There might be some outliers, but in general people are way more focused on the goal than the journey. And with the prevalence of auto-grouping tools, they tend to disregard other people as much as possible.

I still miss my old wrath guild and some of the ones I've been in on various failed pservers. I'm also looking forward to having our forever home soon, and in my experience it's a lot easier to find a good, friendly guild on vanilla/classic servers. 
---
It was probably about 5am, a few of my friends and I were just out and about exploring and trying to get up mountains that we probably weren't supposed to be able to. We got up a decent sized one and I just kinda stood there and looked at the sunrise. I felt a sense of comradery and peace.
---
God forbid you overcome this slight inconvenience so that someone else could also benefit from that chest spawn.
---
Go ele at 40, take ele mastery as well as it’s very good pre 60. Buy dream weave gloves and chest, if you’re real pro you lvl engineering and get the green lens of natures wrath and add another 34-36 to ur nature spells (all you really do is spam lightning bolt as Ele lvling as it’s most damage per mana and quick casts). Grab some natures wrath/eagle gear but have a nice balance. Always buy mage water at log in and you can cruise through quests/grinding. You will drink, but that’s solely because you are pumping out lightning bolts so fast and destroying mobs in a short amount of time. Plus it’s way more effective for wpvp encounters as that shit 1h enhance (or any enhance) offers nothing for pvp other than a 20% chance to get a proc that requires you to be in melee range. 
---
I think I had very close to 100 spell power in my 40s and I had a blast pushing to 60. Its great because it REALLY changes up ur playstyle from enhance and feels refreshing rather than feeling burnt out once you get that mount. 
---
This is the best class, somewhat complicated and takes a bit of time to fully grasp, but once you realize you have tools for each situation and which ones are the most effective at a given time(purging and totem dropping, stand still healing, nuking and shocking, or Frost shocking a rogue beating on ur priest, followed by a cure poison/poison clean totem drop to allow him to escape) you will increase ur teams overall strength ten fold. 
---
What if this situation is the reason to why we don't have a time machine?
---
Someone has maybe made one in the future but the one who used it first went back to fuck that person up, or somehow altered the future because of it.
---
when you have a heated argument about a blue boe back in vanilla just to see the chest despawn in the meantime... yes, pretty sure :P
---
I'm going to be the voice of positivity here. I quit WoW during the shitfest that was WoD (after actually having loved MoP). Tried to get back into Legion, but the whole levelling experience didn't mesh with me. To get my WoW fix I spent this period playing on private servers, where I fell in love with old WoW again. But the shitty quality of the pservers and the drama in the community really made me disillusioned with them and when classic was announced I decided to stay away from private servers as to not taint my vanilla experience. So I had to get my WoW fix elsewhere while I was waiting. The good things I had heard about Legion made me sad I decided to sit the expansion out, so I went into BfA thinking I'd play it for a while waiting for Classic to release. I can honestly say I've really loved it so far, being apparently one of the few to enjoy it even among retail players. It's certainly got its flaws and it no longer feels like the same game it once was, but I definitely think BfA has its upsides and I might even consider remaining in retail as well as playing classic once it releases.
---
It was kind of cute at first, but you're pushing the script pretty hard at this point. Does it not get boring saying the same thing over and over?
---
The toxicity and entitlement. Yikes, what a loser. 
---
Be save and do it after release. September is what I would do if your boss needs to know now.
---
Yeah but how many of those have actually sold for the prices that you've indicated in your post?
---
I'd still like the option. It was available in vanilla so why not in classic?
---
I never even tought of only geeting the good items out of a chest, but thanks to the OP now I know this can be done.
---
Thanks OP, I'm looking forward to doing that in classic :)
---
The trick is to know what pet you want ahead of time!
---
I am a dorf hunter, I had been playing horde for years on retail (I originally started as an alliance druid and then switched to horde)
---
So I am really getting into the Dwarf lore and stuff, especially as a hunter who has skinning and mining.
---
Anyway~ 
---
You just have to plan ahead of time, and even if you don't it's not that bad I would assume. That is because with skinning you can just farm some skins and level up your pet at the same time, or without skinning you could farm cloth or a specific drop from a near level mob.
---
The worst part of hunter to me is having to have ammo, the loss of a bag slot and having to min max your training points on your pet (idk if you can 'respec' your pet)
---
People say classic will die because it's only nostalgia. But, that is exactly how I felt when tried to play Bfa. Everything that I expected to enjoy was just not fun.
---
No clue. I see two priced for over four grand. I assume a seller of something that rare would have some sort of understanding of its worth. Collectors items are hard to evaluate though. e.g. a vase from 1780 might be worth $800,000 but a buyer might only come along once a decade.
---
Never met a warrior who straight up refused to tank a run for a guildie cause they were fury. Maybe I am lucky, or maybe you are exaggerating how fury warriors behave. 
---
Either way I think it's more than realistic to find other than your MT to tank for stuff outside raiding for you.
---
At this point I'm watching every possible video I can get my hands on while trying to decide which class I'm going to main and which I'm going to alt. At this point I've narrowed it down to Warrior and Shaman but can't decide which to main/alt and haven't nailed down levelling and end-game spec for either class.
---
I have one friend who's most likely going to jump on but he only plays a couple hours a week max so I'll probably just make a toon to level with him outside of my regulars. Aside from that, I'm really looking forward to when Guild applications start to hopefully find a good home for when Classic launches. 
---
I'm still unsure about PvE vs PvP servers due to the fact that with 2 kids, my wife and work/life, my playing time is limited and if I spend 2 of my 3 hours one night being ganked, that won't be very appealing. But saying that, I'm afraid of losing out on that side of the game which is huge part to the Vanilla experience.
---
Yes it will vary by server, but I don't think anyone wants to spend an hour doing a farm to then find out it brings them near nothing or is much worse than another farm.
---
If you had sold those items and THEN said "I made this much, it will vary by server but you can expect to roughly get x-y gold if you get x-y greens/shards/whatever"
---
Alright, good to know.
---
Fun fact- I actually geared up FASTER after I took a 6-month break. 
---
I played day 1 back in 2004. I was in a major raiding guild, we were all new to WoW, BWL was just released and we were about 80% through MC (but we still wiped regularly... Baron Gedon...). I got about 3-4 epics in a few months and decided to take a break. 
---
6 months later, I come back. I message my old guild, they let me join the next raid. Next run we clear MC easily, all the loot is duplicate for them now, so I get 3 more pieces in 1 night. Next day, we half clear BWL and I get another unneeded piece.
---
Early on, everyone is competing hard for gear, after a while it's much easier to get. The gear upgrades are still only minor, so you're still relevant. 
---
So have fun, take a break if you need to. Most importantly, maintain good relationships in WoW classic. If I had been a greedy or careless before my break, I wouldn't have been able to rejoin my guild. Remember, in classic you don't get multiple servers in raiding, so you see the same players all the time and they remember you.
---
Happy cake day btw!
---
Kek 
---
People buy them. I've bought some really expensive stuff that wouldn't make sense to a lot of people
---
It’s been an enjoyable ride to 45 and maybe I’ll have the same experience but I’ve gotten good hours of fun so far 
---
What if they just ask you to drop a mana tide before inviting you to the raid?
---
I literally played for 3 hours and didnt even get to 111 before I got off and went back to vanilla servers.
---
Why not 19k?
---
I recall bringing a 56 druid to MC for the sole purpose of having another curse removal in the raid.
---
Cool sounds like you have some real catching up to do:-D
---
You’ll start to realize everything is kind of just a linear stat climb. Your rotations become more fleshed out and definitely polished. But it quickly becomes all very mundane. Raids/dungeons and the such are interesting due to mechanics and attempting to carry out your rotation while having to dodge/utilize mechanics but that’s it. I found a bard to be most fun due to song weaving and a more organic open ended gameplay. (Not so much a forced rotation compared to a reactionary one)
---
After BFA launched, the remnants of my guild and another guild put together a raiding roster and we simply dropped like flies.  I simply logged off after the break between our first heroic Zul kill and whatever that last boss was, the worm thing and never logged back in personally, but I hung around in discord for a while after that.
---
We got through 3 mythic bosses, and after they downed the 3rd, the RL posted in discord: "raise your hand if you are having fun raiding in BFA."  Nothing.  "Raise your hand if you want to continue mythic raiding."  Nothing.  "Raise your hand if you want to continue raiding at all."  Nothing.
---
BFA is flat out boring.  The game designers started taking wrong turns during Wrath but they were still headed north.  Sometime around WoD they got so lost that they don't even realize they're lost.  Lo and behold, they're managing to get back to where they've started and are releasing classic WoW.  When classic overtakes BFA in sub numbers for a protracted period of time, I wonder if anyone at Blizzard will have the sand to sack all the incompetents who butchered this game over the years.  (I'm looking at you, Ion).
---
Mind Control was always one of my favorite items to play with. Either with the priest ability or using the mind control helm with my rogue. Sneaking into a horde base and MCing a gear warrior that was maybe afk and having him go to town on and obviously get rekt by the guards. But not before usually killing a few low levels ha. 
---
If you are done with BFA, is there any games you've been thinking about playing b4 classic drops?
---
I feel like that is what WOW has become. I remember the old days of different stats and experimenting. Mp/5 vs into etc
---
There is an option to only see the ones that sold and for how much 
---
I'm playing a shaman, probably enhancement. Pretty sure most of the HWL/generals gears is really good for the spec. Since Tier gear is not
---
Although I agree with your sentiment... Two times you said something to compare one game to the next and used the same name. Re-read your post.
---
&gt;TLDR- If you want to truly **relive** the Classic experience, play the best MMO ever created before you jump back into this casual pond that is WoW.
---
How can people 'relive' the Classic experience by playing a game they've never played before?
---
Thanks for the reply, this is really great information. Honestly, just the part about changing up the play style at 40 is a great point. Just when things start to really slow down, completely change up the meta and go another route so it feels fresh and new. I love it. Plus, I've been watching some Elemental Shaman PvP videos and wow...
---
What race do you plan on going? I'm (almost) dead set on Troll, as I plan to mostly PvE at 60 (Resto) but their shortcomings in PvP have me a little worried as I'm not sure what the impact is.
---
I think people always try to poke holes in stuff, your guide was fine, there is always going to be competition, I guess no one should ever try to tame rare pets like Lupos, The Rake or Broken Tooth because there are going to be a lot of hunters wanting them. It's a bit silly to think like that aye?
---
The thing is, everyone is looking to make gold quick when classic hits, but your video gives a new way to make gold, the more people are spread out in ways of making gold the better it is for everyone because there will be less competition.
---
Even if there are other people in the area questing or farming the same thing, is it really any worse than another farming spot that has five + people trying to kill the same mob?
---
Besides, if it is for a quest you can just have master looter on and because it is for a quest the person can still loot the quest thing I think. 
---
And if it is personal loot (which I kind of hope for but also not because it is not authentic) then you would just have other people in your group. So if you are at max level and they are questing, you kill faster and get more and they are not going to turn down a level 60 helping them kill shit.
---
Sooooo, you didn't watch Classicast then?
---
Orc or Tauren. I prefer orc Bc rogues never want to really mess with you since one stun resist and an intercept resist means a warrior is dead meat no questions asked. 
---
Go back to 2004. Buy several CE's, make a Warrior. Level him up to 60. Join a good raiding guild, convince them to make you MT. Farm MC until you have Thunderfury. Join the pool for the Rank 14 grind, position yourself on the list last so that you receive Rank 14 before the 2.0 patch hits, meaning you get the keep the title forever. 
---
What... Don't tell me I'm not the only one who's thought about this a lot?

Yea this guy is pretty good, been following him on twitch for a while but didn't know he had youtube,

Being able to /camp and then use an instance reset macro that puts you at the entrance of the instance when you log back in is what makes these instance grinds so fast and efficient. 
---
I don't recall this being a thing in vanilla and I don't think we can guarantee it will be a thing in classic. 
---
&gt; I assume a seller of something that rare would have some sort of understanding of its worth. 
---
Way to be an educated consumer. Sellers love people like you. Lol
---
Sweet, I’m also going to try to get the wife to roll a priest, to have those sweet heals while we level, but as she’s only played to around lvl 25 before, I’m not holding my breath that she’ll make it to the end game, lol. 
---
Hopefully we’ll find some other like minded Classic WoW lovers to jam some PvE content with us Horde side in the EST, and build a fun little guild!
---
If I'm going to relive the classic experience, I'll just play on a wow private server. Playing on a game I never played before is not the classic experience, that's just playing a new game.
---
Sea of thieves has been a time killer, but I also kind of switched a focus to my health, and learning code! (Beginner status) 
---
I took raid times and moved those to my “class days” after work. Then the other days (since I’m getting excellent sleep not to make a raid schedule/farm herbs/farm m+) I wake up early and go lift. Maybe these will be good habits so I can take vanilla in moderation. 
---
... so little story.
---
I played WoW from closed beta till WoTLK. I was a kid/teenager for most of my experience and I had a father who was also into the game (hence the closed beta access) and played much more endgame/hardcore.  By burning crusade and Lich king I was older and max level for both those xpacs, I did basic raiding and dungeons. I got past the first 5-6 bosses for Lich King itself etc etc. but I overall just loved the immersive game play. I played multiple classes, loved exploring, seeing how stats effected gameplay, the ability to create and develop a character that all felt so different and unique.
---
So, like a lot of WoW vets, I went off to college, became an adult and ultimately gave up WoW. Fast forward nearly 10 years and I have a family and *some* free time at night and on weekends. We have a PlayStation mainly used for PSVue and other television watching apps, but I thought it’d be cool to check out a game. I always liked final fantasy growing up and I thought the concept of having an MMORPG final fantasy that was accessible through PS4 to be AMAZING. I played a lot the first 3-4 months I owned the game (up before stormblood). And it eventually just hit me. The gear is all flat basic stats, sure you change your appearance, but there’s no real dynamic changes that gear makes. The way all my abilities were designed through potency literally meant there was a linear climb through progression that made sure to only spike up or down so much and stay on a gradual climb. Most the jobs I played developed from “1,2,3” to “1,2, X or Y, 3” (this is  a very basic example... the rotations definitely get more complex) and it just didn’t really keep me interested or how dynamic everything in vanilla wow was. 
---
So I loaded up that old WoW client, decided to dust off my account and hop into the game. I mean a new expansion called BFA was just about to come out and it promised getting back to some of the roots of WoW. 
---
Let me tell you I never made it past 40 on any character. It was literally a sham. They took the game I loved and made it a casino roulette with very little upside, exciting moments or even danger. The items I used to belove? All just renamed/rehashed stat gear. That all was compressed into 2-4 stats for your character and it all is just a linear gear climb. No huge shifts. No mp5, nature damage, just no variety or complexity at all. Most of the kits for the classes were pretty completed by 20-30 besides little tools and things to make dps/aoe easier. I could pull 5 mobs and just aoe them down heal after and have no after effects. No thought. No planning. No method to the madness at all. Just plow and Zerg through content. The factor the ended up killing it for me was how they had mob level scale to you. It became sickening to know everything was just a linear climb that created a facade of a roulette table, occasionally popping out shiny things that increased you stamina and X stat by 1 or 2. 
---
Classic can’t come soon enough.
---
You'd assume I'd buy something like this. I stay far away from non-conventional sales.
---
set hearthstone to Camp Mojache, invite someone, make them leader then leave group? or skip the heartstone bit and just suicide, depending on which one is closer, but grouping should reset the instances anyway.
---
iirc /camp or logout worked the same way in retail though, teleported you to the start of the instance, but the instance reset script probably wouldn't.
---
Lol "sorry ninja looters!"
---
Do they think we are a retarded, overhyped bunch of cuckolds? They probably do...
---
They are adding a feature that will corrode the game in order to hire less.
---
That is not how you make a great game, and definitely not how you get to my wallet.
---
I'm in my early 40's. I had a personal investor back in 2002-ish. I always remember asking about investing in companies like this and he always discouraged me from putting everything into them because tech is too volatile after the .com bubble burst. I understand that's kind of a general rule of investing is to spread out your investments but this still pisses me off.
---
* Plate Tank - Warrior
---
* Healer - Paladin (Shaman if you play H)
---
* Mail DPS - Hunter
---
* Leather DPS - Rogue/Druid
---
* Cloth DPS - Mage
---
My main focus making this composition is to have the best loot distribution posible.
---
Tank: I decided against Druid tank so the Rogue can have all the leather agi gear but you could have Druid tank and Warrior dps.
---
Healer: I chose to use the highest possible armour class healer so they have the most gear available.
---
Dps: If you choose Druid dps instead of rogue there are 2 options, feral or balance (all the agility leather goes to the Hunter instead but the caster leather can't go to the healer).
---
Mage can be switched for Shadow Priest or Warlock but I think Mage is the best option.
---
/camp definately was a thing in Vanilla (think it still is actually), i also think /script ResetInstances(); was a thing in Vanilla, i think it actually was the only way to hard reset instances (apart from waiting outside the instance for like 1 hour) as you couldn't right click &gt; reset all instances in Vanilla. 
---
West coast of what country? This is an international forum you buffoon.
---
Guess I should have said NA. Buffoon is a bit strong but I will roll with it.
---
Yes they were but I don't think you could use them in succession like they are on private servers. 
---
If you try to reset the instance while you are still inside it you will see an error in your chat box like "can't reset instance while members are still inside."
---
If you just /camp all it does it log you out, when you log back in you will be in the exact same spot deep in the instance.
---
What people farming instances on private servers do is /camp, then it starts the 20 seconds countdown to log you out and during those 20 seconds they use the instance reset macro and for whatever reason it works as you are logging out, it will say "instances successfully reset" rather than give you the error about still being in the instance. Then at the 20 seconds mark they are logged out and when they log back in they are at the entrance. 
---
Heya!
---
Mained a warlock Vanilla through BC, then a DK tank for early Wrath.  Finally settled in and then stopped playing as a priest in Wrath, who had been my alt since Vanilla.  I'm looking to go priest from the start this time, it was far and away the most enjoyable role I had throughout.
---
NA, PvE, Alliance, EST, Dwarf Priest, Raiding/Social
---
I'm pretty sure i read somewhere that that's against the rules though. Even though multiboxing is "legal" you can only pvp with one of the characters at a time.
---
I joined in '09, when I was 9 years old. Wrath was still going strong, and I made it all the way to endgame (though, being 9, nobody wanted to let me do end game content with them because I was a bit of an idiot.) Then, Cataclysm started getting hyped up. I remember going to the midnight release for it, standing out in the cold, talking to people that I'd never met before about my lvl 80 DK a little bit too much.  I played through Cata and most of Mists (thought I didn't like Cata nearly as much,) then fell off for a bit, occasionally resubbing. I joined back up for BfA and enjoyed the first couple weeks with a friend, but got bored. Here's to hoping WoW Classic manages to bring back that social aspect I remember so well from Wrath. 
---
Classicdb dot com, search field marshal and go from there. 
---
I think it's pretty much established we are going to have old graphics. 
---
Zelda is probably my favorite franchise of all-time with WoW being a close second. Naturally, the Linken quest line for Linken’s Sword of Mastery is my favorite quest line in the game and it was so much fun to stumble upon it. I have always kept the sword in my bank on all of my alts. 
---
I believe you are looking for [this.](https://classicdb.ch/?itemsets) Just search for "PVP" and you can filter out the other stuff
---
Why?  It doesn't stack with sunder does it?  I kind of remember that if a druid put faerie fire on a mob in vanilla you couldn't sunder because it said a more powerful spell was already active
---
Said as someone who is thinking about rolling druid for classic.  \*Cries, hoping to get a raid spot\*
---
Joined opening day.  Raided/pvp'd a ton until i got bored in Cataclysm.  First time I ended my sub was near the end of cataclysm, when Diablo 3 released, played the hell out of that instead.  Started playing again in legion, but very casually.
---
One of my good friends who I played Vanilla with is hyped alongside me.
---
Another isn't very hype.
---
My wife is sick of hearing about it.
---
Private servers are completely wrong with every chest compared to the demo.
---
I wanted to make an "explore guide + chest guide" for myself to use on classic release. 
---
Bassicly i found 4 chests that were possible to take at lvl 1. - Durotar Sea one near the castle - The barren Lake one near WC - Mulgore north right when u get inside - South of thunderbluff (u need to die for this one but graveyard run is 30 sec) 
---
So when the demo came out i was excited to see if i could use this. 
---
Sadly almost every chest was not at the same place, in was in the same area but not exact place which completed ruined the guide.
---
Example the one neat WC (Their is a small pool outside of WC  - It's in this one on private servers (0 mobs)
---
In the demo it was in the big one (15+ mobs)
---
Also addons won't work for classic every addon needs to be remade, if you want to find all the private server locations search them online on a database with the chest name :)
---
A tier 2 night elf rogue saw me sneaking around westfall and ran me through deadlines and taught me about the class. This was my first week playing the game. His name was Shirk and he played on crushridge NA. 
---
Since then I've always done my best to go out of my way to help newer players in all of the mmos I've played.
---
I farmed lbrs with my rogue. Arcanite reaper, fire protection and the epic mage robe is solo able.
---
DM Tribute hunter farming is most likely the best one :p
---
It would be significantly easier than it was when MC was the main content. Look at all the patches from 1.1-1.12. Every talent tree in the game, items, spells, and raid nerf changes. It has little to do with pservers.
---
Many players would still struggle to do 40 man content, but the idea that they should have the only raid content on release be much easier than it was back in real vanilla is ridiculous.
---
With a sprinkle of the lost vikings reference (a game made by blizzard before they renamed to blizzard) aka, the 3 dwarfs, Erik, Baleog, and Olaf.
---
Pallys couldn’t use axes 
---
I had forgotten all about that quest chain.
---
People might buy them but my point was it's not something 99% of people are buying
---
While I was still in the beginning zone, a random passerby gave me 5 gold. That 5 gold helped me so much in buying my leveling skills and armor.
---
Hey u/Catfish_Mudcat, the build I'm replying to is also very good and honestly probably a little better if WoW is your main usage. As a note, u/oilyvladir has a nice post above which elaborates quite a bit on some things that are worth considering as well. Just wanted to highlight both of these as options for you/things to consider.
---
For PS4 owners I highly recommend Horizon Zero Dawn. Really surprised the hell out of me. 
---
druid leveling is easy af
---
I thought vanilla style Decursive won't be available in classic since it will use the 7.3.5 addon API?
---
Thank you!
---
Same answer as every thread like this, pick whatever you want to play and play it.
---
Im just saying it is My experince with servers that had a pop of 9-12 k
---
Nu uh if wrong 
---
And rogue and priest need to switch places
---
I mean... electricity to run the PC. The PC itself. Not exactly things that are free.
---
Some FFXIV, but no nearly as much as i used to.
---
I'm waiting for RE2 remake and KH3, this month. Those will last me a while.
---
Am Rogue. 1-15 is god awful. 
---
Yeah druid should be in panel 4, priest should be in panel 1, rogue should be in panel 2... It would be kinda funny, if the classes were at least in the right spots
---
On classicdb you can click “item sets” and it shows all the various PvE and PvP item sets.
---
I'd like to have the calendar as it is in retail, pretty convenient to organize raids without having to use 3rd party. 
---
Same here. Finally had to stop at about 114 or so. Just couldn't get into it. Too boring or easy I'm not sure. Also there's just no social aspect to the game at all anymore. I enjoyed meeting random strangers doing similar quest and striking up conversations and perhaps becoming friends. Wow is none of that today. It's for the people that want instant gratification. I look forward to classic release and hope it works out. 
---
While I always rolled Horde characters (from Vanilla up through the release of cata, which is when I quit), my old guildies and I are thinking about rolling Alliance, this time. We'll see how long that lasts, though. I've always been partial to undead.
---
I never got to play vanilla much, started right before tbc. Played some private server resently and just learned summoning stones got introduced right before tbc...
---
So I hope they use these instead of the queue thing. More comunity based this way, and liked the chalange of competing for the stones with the horde, and getting to them.
---
Loved the world pvp tbh. 
---
I use I O P K L N and use Ctrl-I,Ctrl-O,Ctrl-P and so on 
---
&gt;  I kept my legendary pants on my rogue through 119  
---
But... the effect turns off when you hit 116.
---
Dont worry. I think all Americans are buffoons. I often say (on p-servers) that people always complain about the Chinese, buy atleast they dont turn world-chat into shit like the Americans do lol.
---
Also, you Americans call Deadmines "VC" and thats focked up man! I get triggered and offended everytime I it.
---
Man, you might eat some downvotes from the #nochanges crowd.
---
But while we're talking about it, honestly they should change a lot of the AH and quest log UI. You should be able to right-click add items to the AH pane, and it should auto-populate the price if you already have that item listed; and/or add an option to list multiple stacks at once. The quest log should just be wider with the quest names on the side, so you can see all of your quests at once instead of just 4-5.
---
I think they added those changes to retail, it's been forever since I played on official servers so I don't remember, but it just requires you to get UI addons.
---
Also, swing timers/auto shot timers... I get that it's not a part of wow officially and I know people will disagree, but for PvE and PvP kiting it's absolutely required. You might as well just add it to the game so that people with addons don't have a massive leg up over casual players.
---
Just because its listed for that much doesnt mean anyone will pay that much.  C'mon guys we've all played auction house.
---
I mained a paladin in classic. It is very rewarding. You tune your gear spell rank vs crit and can make absolutely optimal healing. I smashed healing meters in raids even in naxx while being undergeared and was always #1 in effective healing too. 
---
One place things got a little... Risky though, was dungeons. If your tank takes huge hits, you have literally zero damage mitigation. Other than like... Loh armor buff haha. So basically, if boss does burst faster than you can heal, even if it's only for 6 seconds, and the difference is more than your tank hp post mitigation... Pretty much your going to have to do some weird shit.
---
My most memorable would have to be when I hit High Warlord. I missed it the previous week by 2% when I thought I was going to get it. That resulted in another 40-50 hours but it was well worth it seeing that I achieved Rank 14 the following week
---
i can’t remember exactly whether it was the corrupted blood, the green dragons, or something else, but I’m pretty sure it was corrupted blood.
---
In any event, shenanigans were going on and it got so bad that GM’s came and started freezing people in unbreakable ice blocks. I was stirring up shit too but I managed to go undetected.
---
Broodlust  - when your guild requires you to get Onyxia attuned ASAP 
---
&gt; Your character to start autoattacking when you use an ability like Mortal Strike or Sinister Strike, as it’s been since TBC/Wotlk if i recall. Right now they’re always macrod to do the same, and it feels somewhat pointless to be completely honest.
---
I'm pretty sure this will happen now because Classic runs on modern engine, but i'm not sure.
---
For me I would love aoe loot, that's all.
---
&gt; just learned summoning stones got introduced right before tbc...
---
They were introduced in BC not right before. They were added in the 2.0 patch
---
Hey that sounds like an awesome add-on. Hope that would work
---
a 2-3 second mini sprint added to gnome escape artist. would allow you to catch up and would make gnome super strong for pvp which is awesome cuz of the passive perma tilt that it makes horde feel when every alliance in bgs was gnome 
---
Wow that's incredible dude.
---
You were peaking in life bro, not sure how you'll top that off.
---
I hit 120, did mythics, and quit the day the raid came out. It's just so bad. There's no coming back from its mistakes either.
---
Found the goblin.
---
&gt; It would be significantly easier than it was when MC was the main content 
---
What I'm trying to explain is that the time when MC was the main content without catchup gear etc. was not a time where the population of Classic was crowded and where things were figured out. That time was insignificant compared to the raid activity of people past 1.10.
---
**The point is, there was veeeeery few people (and cool for you if you were among them) that tried MC during the period it was the main content** (try to convince me the opposite). So few people that in fact we could argue whether it makes sense to try to balance things around this era. And to me it doesn't make sense to make such a hassle for it.
---
In Classic it will be the same. Unless they delay step 2 for 6+ months, most people won't even be geared enough or have unlocked everything to try MC before step 2, let alone clear it. It's logical. **Most People will take months to get level 60, get a minimum of a gear and do all the quests required. Specially if they don't rush it and do other things like professions, reputation, farming etc, which people will do.** Like it's not realistic at all to think the average player will feel the itemization difference since they won't try MC/Ony so early.
---
Yes top guilds will feel the difference, but top guilds don't matter compared to the normal population. And you can give top guilds whatever patch and itemization you want, they will crush it, with only 1-2 days of difference.
---
The problem is that I want different pets for different things.  Carrion Bird for solo grinding, Wind Serpent for DPS.
---
Get the game out. I'm sick of playing retail, need classic asap. No delays from trying to qol things.
---
I havn't really tried to recruit any friends but my wife is down to give it a go.
---
She leveled from 0-85 with me in Cata. she enjoyed it a lot but ultimatly didnt feel compelled to play more and didn't get super attached to her character.  This was mostly my fault I think as I made the experience too easy for her (all leveling gear, got her mount instantly, basically went for speed over fun..) 
---
I explained to her how classic is different. we will enjoy a journey over 4-6 months of slow leveling/exploring 
---
wish me luck 
---
So I played a Prot Warrior in vanilla. Quiet possibly the worst farming class in the game. No healing, No dps, no way to do much solo. I found several niche areas where I could leverage the strengths of my class (hard to dismount, stuns and fears) into profitable solo farming on par with DM farm runs.   
---
I think any class/profession set can leverage their strengths into something profitable. It just takes some research and trial and error. 
---
Got an urge from time to time to resub, but then I remember the daily tasks I would need to grind with no end to stay relevant and I just realize I would not log on more than maybe twice 
---
I'm a little confused about what you're saying with the druid talents, paladins had a way to tank/dps/heal in 1 spec? Do you have them and druids backwards or what? Paladins were terrible at tanking, and there's a reason ret is a meme spec.
---
Druids have Heart of the wild feral/resto combo that can pretty effectively do 5-mans as any role, and you can even use it to heal MC/ony pugs. My current plan when classic drops is to go druid, feral to 60, HotW/resto for 5-mans till I can get my BiS and early MC/ony trash epics, then see if I can get a guild spot as 3rd tank slot feral/dps, if not go resto and heal.
---
Also no idea what you are talking about with druids being aids to level, they're definitely T1 alongside hunters and warlocks.
---
The problem is that the pets can be obtained from digital collectors edition bundle.
---
It looks like I am. Sorry for the confusion. 
---
Wow, that is a crazy cool memory. Thanks for sharing that. 
---
Increase maximum number of quests you can have in your log. 20 is so low that you constantly have to drop quests while leveling
---
Aha, that was it! My bad... 
---
If its possible to be notified about a chat message, its possible to extend that to an auto invite. Unless they plan to remove API invites, which would be pretty crazy. 
---
dude that's just the usual content child trading cycle, nothing special.
---
Bonus points if it was a front flip on a Night elf. 
---
You got more Wpvp from making your way to the instance than by getting summoned directly to it
---
Shamans like mp5 and their consumables. Some of my recent runs: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMJDl4wVi8vHeC5bZz1XbPjDxNwPRF5kh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMJDl4wVi8vHeC5bZz1XbPjDxNwPRF5kh)
---
But for Classic I'll likely go mage main for more fun and crazines plus likely a druid alt or less likely a Shaman.
---
Well they said its going to be so tough luck 
---
The only player's experience that will be "ruined omg" by non progressive itemization will be the ones that rush endgame content, and being efficient, which are arguably a negligible portion of the population of Classic. Is it worth it for Blizzard to make so many efforts for this only? I don't think so. Convince me otherwise.
---
And again, by your reasoning, everyone that will level an alt will have his experience ruined. Because it will not be the same as when the game launched. And every player that will not begin to play after summer will have its experience ruined as well. Like really? Is that the way you see it? Just chill and take your time. And if you want to be first of server, it will change nothing for you.
---
Did they clarify if it’s by zone or by quest?
---
Yeah this place takes forever to do too. Probably one of my least favorites now 
---
Same. I finally got on a classic server and I’ve spent more time leveling a shaman in the last two weeks than I’ve play BFA in months. Having a blast. 
---
Explain how it would corrode the game. Do you even know what loot trading is? Seriously, it seems like nobody on this subreddit does. The current system in retail WoW is that if you NEED roll an item, its soulbound and can't be traded even in the same group. 
---
Oh yeah, forgot about those dudes!
---
Ive never felt any suck when leveling a priest. Sure, it takes a bit of time but nothing of it is bad in any way. 
---
Feel free to add me on discord, Rennoc#7533, maybe we can keep each other informed if we find something.
---
I think most people would be okay with a modified achievement system, but I don't really see them making anything along those lines. Like, remove all dungeon and raid achievements and only keep the really difficult achievements that can be seen as an alternative to endgame (complete all quests in a zone, read every book, get exalted with every faction.) 
---
Exactly
---
I often think how awesome TBC would have been if we never got flying mounts, personally I think it would have kept closer to the Vanilla feel, not to mention the whole Shaman Paladin swap.  Those two things are such a huge leap into what I think destroyed what made Vanilla awesome.   
---
Your other two points, closeness of the opposing factions and loss of high level players also stuck the nail in the coffin.  More so the factions. I remember how it felt when you went into the opposing factions zones, or even neutral zones, everything felt different, felt more dangerous.  Made you feel like there was a war going on.
---
Go play other games like Cities Skyline. chill relaxing game lol
---
Yeah they settled on 1.12 because Classic itself is a huge risk in terms of profitability, and having to do progression patching would likely just mean Classic doesn't ever get made. 
---
Its the whole game for the first couple weeks to deal with the massive influx of retail tourists who will quit in a week. 
---
Yeah I'd disagree with that, even on private servers with 8k people concurrently playing.. I never saw world pvp outside of dungeons until BRD/LBRS. You'd sometimes see it outside of SM or Uldaman.. but that's about it. 
---
/nod
---
Blizzard has a great opportunity here, they have a chance to hit the reset button and people want it.  They know what their path did to the game, and depending on the success of Classic, they can take a different path.   Experiment with a few servers and do what they threw out in favor of the atrocity that the game has become in retail.
---
Because the classic experience was about moving from EQ to WoW.
---
That like your opinion, man. 
---
Then make it harder earlier like it was in vanilla and then they can nerf it over time. Like what happened in actual vanilla. It's not like it takes a 30 man team to nerf fucking MC a little bit when AQ comes out lol.
---
Everyone was weary of those stocks back then. Also in 2004 Apple definitely was not taken seriously. 
---
mage levelling is great, everytime i kill a mob i sit down for 20 secs to drink some conjured water and cry to myself
---
Again, surely not worth the effort for Blizzard given how few people are concerned by it. But if they have the ressources to do it then I hope they do for you. 
---
Thanks much.   That prebuilt system u/Pull_The_Curtain linked is pretty much along the lines of what I'm looking for.   It's funny, I posted specfically looking for the most bare bones system I could find and people are replying with builds from $500 to $1200.  Like I literally only want to use the system for classic so ideally I want $150 and under. 
---
I hope both communities get what they want but, I'm kind of at a point where I think. Major gaming studios may be doa for me. Blizzard is making a lot of scary noises that have me worried. So soon after the fall of Bethesda I am shook :( I really hope blizz delivers. 
---
ESO seems to be in a good spot atm... wondering wheter I should go for it.
---
I’m a CE :)
---
Yes, you're the only one
---
Most of the $250 are probably boxes where the key has already been used, which lowers the value considerably.
---
Ah ok, i've never tried that, so i can't tell if that "bug / feature" was a thing in Vanilla. 
---
I reckon you are right in that respect this might not be a thing (using both the way you describe) as i don't think resetting a instance while anyone is in the instance actually works (or should work for that matter). If it does i guess thats a bug atleast and should be fixed. 
---
Is mage leveling really that much harder than lock? Serious question since I’ve only leveled a warlock.
---
It is simple.  There is no real reward for progressing.  Mobs scale to your level and to your Ilvl in all zones.  Each time you gain "power" your foes get stronger too; when you are leveling to 120 this is VERY noticeable.  Further, there are no new abilities for leveling up, and many classes and specs lost key components to their playstyle with the legendaries and artifacts gone.  Azerite can't begin to compensate for what is gone, and the Heart is very bland.  
---
In short, you are weaker and your class is worse to play universally.
---
The LFG tool(not LFD)
---
Makes finding groups much better.
---
7/10 would recommend 
---
I still play just to say farewell to my Main since 2006. Tykis, NE Prot Warr. I can roll him again, but I am thinking of going a different route. But the game has definitely gotten stale. Mindless even. It's sad really. I just don't see myself switching back and forth between Classic and Retail. Especially if I join a great guild. I think the only way I would go back to retail after Classic is released, is if the next expansion is the last. Some End of Retail story line where the Horde and Alliance live happily ever after together lol 
---
Stats are still pretty powerful if you don't find an upgrade.
---
because 12k is higher than 4k
---
For vanilla I want to say it’s usually a couple hundred. The later expansions are all significantly cheaper.
---
launch druids were the worst class to level by far
---
me waking up on the 25th of December, logging in after furious night gaming session  just to find out my friend forgot to take his meds and died   
---
yes - it is much less efficient. Warlocks face-roll leveling.
---
Some people take longer to realize that WoW is basically a pile of shit now. I played WoW since 2005, so, my time investement in the game was huge, to say the least.
---
When they announced BfA, and I read about personal loot, removal of master loot, "removal of PvP servers", replacing artifacts with another artifacts, just called differently (necklace),removal of tier sets...I realized that WoD would be absolutely replaced by BfA in term of which is the worst WoW expansion.
---
Hence, the moment they announced BfA and all these changes, I canceled my sub.
---
And man, I was so happy for doing it. I expected BfA to be a disaster...but Blizzard managed to make it much, much worse, woth titanforging, class mess up, stupid island expeditions and warfronts.
---
If I thought it actually sucked I wouldn't bother playing Classic but having leveled both pallys and a priest I get where they're coming from.
---
Both are very predictable, safe if simple grinds and I think that's exactly what works with the subset of players that level these classes.
---
&gt;  So-called bloodvine set, for example, is pre-bis for casters and it's basically as good as T2, and you have to get atleast Revered in order to learn the recipes for every set piece.
---
The set is good, i wouldn't call it "Pre-Bis" though as normally you won't have access to it untill you basicly have MC / BWL / Ony on farm. 
---
makes me wonder if these will return with the Classic release this summer. 
---
Replacing a smaller bag that's already equipped with a bigger bag, without having to dump everything from the smaller bag first.
---
Time to take EVERYTHING OUT just to get 2 slots more.... oh I have to sell the stuff to make room for just a moment...
---
 Played Holy Priest exclusively in Vanilla, some on P
---
1. How time consuming is the farming and preparation before the Raid?
---
Not overly hard, some fishing for mana buff, and working some love in the AH you'll get some pots.  Score = 3
---
2.   How well does the PvE specc work in PvP?
---
Horrible from my experience, though I was a bad player when it came to PvP, you can stay alive for awhile but you're a target to every rogue out there. Score = 2
---
3  How easy is solo farming in terms of killing Mobs for reputation?
---
Hard, you do crap for damage and spend time drinkign between fights more often than not, not as bad as a mage, but still too long. Score = 2
---
4.  How easy is solo farming in terms of Resources for crafting?
---
Same as rep grinding, any mob you pull will leave you mana hurt and running half the time.  And we all know resources have a weird magnetic attraction to mobs.  Score = 2
---
5. How high or low is the demand of the Class in Raids?
---
Very high, even a bad H priest gets invites all the time.  I'd log on and have constant whispers for party/raid invites.  Score = 5+
---
6.  Can you solo farm Dungeons?
---
HA!  No... Score = 1
---
7.  How would you rate the T-Sets in terms of looks?
---
Not the worst, but not the best.  And the yellow... ugh..  Score = 3
---
8. How easy is it to find a Dungeon Group?
---
As with Raids, its constant invites.  Score = 5
---
9. How easy is it to farm BiS Pre-Raid gear in terms of competition?
---
You tend to be sharing drops with all other cloth users, adn the occasional Paladin/Shaman, Druid healer.  Can be a headache but not as bad as most classes.  Score = 3
---
10.  How fast or easy does the Class level to 60?
---
Solo, its a slow grind and expensive for water unless you have a generous mage, but dungeons and always someone to group with for heals tends to help it more than most.  Score = 4
---
If you like healing and strive to be good at it, you'll have content for days and an endless supply of groups to be part of.  Solo, you're going to have a bad time.
---
there is a reason people used to call them Irish cause all they do is fight and drink. I'm Irish, used to get a good chuckle at that
---
what is retail?
---
Yep, levelling a priest is slow, but very steady, and you are practically immortal. Can't wait to start wanding things to death again in Classic xD
---
Took you long enough, idiot
---
&gt; paladins had a way to tank/dps/heal in 1 spec? 
---
Yes, you could go holy/prot and tank dungeons perfectly fine. [these](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuox) are the only really "required" healing talents. I currently use 25/26/0 holy reckoning spec and it does perfectly fine in raids and perfectly fine tanking dungeons.
---
Paladins are not "terrible" at tanking, their only real downside in dungeons is no taunt, and you have to drink every 3-4 pulls. Having easy AoE threat is pretty nice too, along with being able to dispel yourself or throw out emergency heals using conc aura for 100% pushback resistance.
---
&gt;Druids have Heart of the wild feral/resto combo
---
Yeah, I'm aware, but with that, you miss out on Nature's Swiftness (unless you drop Leader of the Pack) and you don't get Gift of Nature or Imp Regrowth, and you can't get Moonglow either. You're kinda gimped compared to a full-on "healer" druid.
---
Though if Blizz ends up adding dual spec or reduced respec costs, that'd solve the issue lol
---
&gt;Also no idea what you are talking about with druids being aids to level
---
My memory of leveling a druid goes like this: miss miss dodge parry parry parry miss parry dodge dodge miss miss miss parry dodge
---
Why are you people convinced there will be no item progression? They never said anything like that. This is Blizzard, they arent gonna cheap out on something that is literally only a database change. I mean even private servers do progressive itemisation to some degree.
---
"MC is already easy" is not a good reason to dumb it down even more. MC will be content for a couple of months, at least make it somewhat not freeloot.
---
Have you considered just making your own classic wow server and then you can have it exactly the way you want it?
---
I'm already playing Paladin on pservers right now. Don't want to do the same thing twice.
---
To be clear they haven't confirmed anything regarding sharding. They said it might be a solution to the initial rush.
---
He was a dwarf but yeah that would have been extra points 
---
That's exaclty what I have been playing since I stoped wow
---
I meant paying for 5 accounts
---
&gt; With all three components coming together, we were able to do a test and log in to the game, **create new characters, kill boars, and complete some quests.**  
---
      
---
For some reason, this criteria for testing amused and pleased me.  probably all the times I had a level 9 character arrive at the gates of Org *just shy* of level 10 and went on a brief boar hunt to ding before entering... 
---
Daily crying thread
---
Instead of pressing lifetap you have to sit and drink
---
And subsequently make yourself more water.
---
Well if they roll on everything they will be blacklisted/kicked just as if they ninjad it
---
Hi guys,
---
looking for a guild on [EU]. The big problem for me is that I am working shifts. Id prefer to play Alliance on a german PVE realm, but since it's going to be tough finding a guild I am open to anything. English speaking, horde or PVP realm. Anything is fine.
---
My shifts alternate weekly with working times being 7:00AM-16:00PM (Monday-Saturday) and 14:00PM-23:00PM (Monday-Friday). 
---
Anyone heard of a shift workers guild or a guild that raids Saturday and Sunday evenings?
---
Would love to hear from someone
---
You’re out of your mind.
---
Mage has a fun leveling experience, if you go aoe grinding.
---
I found it challenging and interesting.
---
Ive helped build a guild from the ground up before and its not that easy, but mostly take luck. The real problem is getting a good officer corps that you can rely on, i was lucky and happened upon 3 strangers and we all wanted to build the guild into something bigger. Doing things by yourself is very difficult, organizing 40 people yourself is very difficult, both in and out of raids.
---
If you start from leveling, spam away. Just take whoever, kick the annoyin kids spamming random crap as they come. Make sure you have TS/Discord etc. For people to talk and especially for you to feel out what officers you might like. Try to dungeon with guildies as much as possible to see whose good.
---
Even when you start raiding, members will be dropping like flies and disappearing on you. Recruitment is constant early on. Core members become core members because they stick around. The only way to keep people is to have solid progression, which means explainin the fights well and kicking the people who keep wiping raids. Even still, if youre behind the curve on progression, people will always be trying to jump up to the next guild, nothing you can do about it.
---
Be patient as a GM and tell everyone your expectations for success. Most important thing for me is delegating. If you want to be main raid leader, give away every other raid duty except maybe tank/Cc assigns markings. Every other duty the raid leader performs slows down the raid. Get someone else doing groups, loot, heal assigns. You dont need a class officer of each class, but have someone responsible for each class so they arent pestering you.
---
I dont like discord either but itll do the job. I prefer forums and a Vent server.
---
Make 4 waters.  Drink 2 waters to mana up to make 4 more waters.
---
It's the frog and the well all over again.
---
this is one of my biggest concerns for classic. It doesn't matter how many servers are released, everyone is going to flock to those "streamer" servers.
---
Can you expand on this? Because I'm having a *real* tough time believing you farmed anything at all on par with Mage DM farming...
---
Hard part is on release servers or fresh servers aoe grinding is a myth unless you get into the top 5% of the level curve.
---
Play Warlock without your pet.  That's a mage.
---
(In all seriousness, Mages can be very fast if you AoE grind, but also very fragile if you mess up.  Warlocks have a higher margin of failure.
---
dude don't bother making posts like this. This entire sub is a fantasy land for little kids and retail cosplayers who know nothing about the good of the game and don't care about the integrity of vanilla
---
Except you missed the part where it was explicitly pointed out that "the bonus outweighed the stats of newer gear". To which I pointed out that the effect had turned off by level 119.
---
Yea like trying to stun, fear, bubble, poly anything we could think of. I don't teller a Druid being involved, so now we'll have to form a party and try some more stuff. We are all undead. So just imagine walking by and an undead hits the ground by the elevator with a bunch of other undead dancing and cackling. It probably looked like a death cult to an outside observer. 
---
The point is to level faster and get ahead of the curve.
---
Correct. The earliest backup they had was 1.10 or something so authentic patch progression was never an option. And even if it was I don't think they would've done it, it would've been way too much work for very little gain.
---
Honestly, as someone who's played this game since early 2004, I don't mind it. 
---
From my experience, accidents happen during the distribution of loot. Loot was simply mis-distributed from time to time. It happens often, and sometimes the customer service team would take days to get your item back to the rightful player. It was a hassle. This is a simple solution to that problem without (imo) hindering the experience.  With customer support being stretched as thin as it it (managing 2 games after all), I don't mind them using this shortcut to dedicate resources elsewhere. 
---
Also, during my entire WoW tenure, I've only seen MAYBE 2 ninja's the entire time? 
---
I loved leveling my lock so much...agony, corruption, siphon life, fear...agony, corruption, siphon life, fear...agony, corruption, oh hey he's back, drain life...siphon life, fear...aaaand lifetap good to go!
---
I want to be able to rearrange my characters in the character selection screen.
---
Blacklisted will be ineffective, kick can happen but they'll still be successful once or twice and that's usually all people need for a good roll.
---
why would it be "pretty crazy"? auto invites (to groups or guilds) are very anti-Vanilla and so i wouldn't be surprised to see it removed
---
Wait, you really think Rogues are easier than Priests?
---
You should roll a troll, it suits you. 
---
so if I "accidently" needed it, I would need to contact customer support to have the item transferred?
---
Larger server populations than 4k so that when the hype dies down the servers still have a manageable population of 3k or so left.
---
The largest private server for Vanilla restarted fresh about 8 months ago and had 15k people peaks online. These days its around half of that, 7k which is still healthy without overdoing it. And thats less than a year in, on a FREE server.
---
I fear for classic servers populations after a year if they are capped below 8k honestly. For some reason the community thinks the servers will stay at their cap perpetually 24/7 so they are scared of caps like 8k. I think we are going to learn this the hard way. 
---
&gt; elitistic 
---
not a word dumb dumb
---
Interesting opinion! What keeps you playing the game?
---
I pretty much enjoyed Legion and thought BFA would be kind of the same but with other zones... well 2 weeks in and after getting some gear I don't know what to do!
---
There are only daily/weekly activities or the usual PvE. I don't see what's THAT different from Legion, but there's something missing for me. That's probably the zones actually, I feel stuck on a small island and if I want to wander on the other faction's island (which is also small), I have to port back to the capital, go to a PNJ, open the map to make sure I'm asking for the right destination, wait for the loading screen.. and what is there to do when I get there? WQs?? 
---
Them quoting customer support was a silly strawman and rarely ever happened. 
---
The fact is this new system increases incentives for ninja'ing. Before it was just grief and vendor gold. Now its grief and potentially huge payout.
---
Like you I've played actual vanilla and private servers a ton and I can't recall a single time I saw someone mistakenly Need roll on a BoP.
---
This entire system is created for a problem that basically doesn't exist and it opens up the door for huge ninja looting..... that's just bad decision making from Blizzard.
---
he was mind controlled by the priest
---
Wait - I have this. No way it worth that much. 
---
Your first step is quit your job, apply for financial aid now so you dont get caught without it at launch. Make sure skip the dishes has your correct info because you dont have time to cook now. And stock your fridge completely with mountain dew, cupboards with cheezies... also buy a vent server soon as well.
---
Yeah exactly...the whole point of developing a community is that you develop...a community.  People that ninja loot will be called out and eventually nobody will invite them to a group.
---
I used to play a MUD where you could literally attack any other player at any time, and if you killed them, or if you even just happened upon someone's freshly killed corpse, you could dig up their grave and take all of their shit.  The thing is, the people that did that became known as grave robbers, and they would pretty much become a kill on sight target by anyone higher level or just a target of rounded up gank squads.  Being a shit head simply wasn't worth it, because the rest of the community would bring down the hammer.
---
Nothing wrong with discussing this stuff in the Classic Wow subreddit.
---
No he's not. I agree with him
---
It's a lie they said only starting zones for a very limited time.
---
Were you fighting mobs 3 levels above you? I am currently leveling a druid in cat form and i rarely miss.
---
Like already mentioned by the person above you, druids are really good while leveling.
---
Good movement speed, multiple resource pools and self heal allows you to have nearly 0 downtime while leveling. Not the greatest damage, but enough to be one of the faster levelers.
---
Its one of the easier classes to level in my opinion, if not the easiest besides priest.
---
&gt; People that ninja loot will be called out and eventually nobody will invite them to a group.
---
Sadly that never happens. Ninja's will always be there because the world is just too big and no one ever checks some global blacklist that before inviting people to a group. Just doesn't happen. 
---
Voluntary player blacklisting unfortunately just isn't effective.
---
&gt;Your most memorable, unexpected and magical moment in vanilla?
---
My first five minutes in Teldrassil after creating a character.
---
I came to WoW from Ultima Online, not Everquest. UO was a 2d MMO with graphics [like this](https://i.imgur.com/0wC6Zlo.jpg).
---
Teldrassil was absolutely beautiful.
---
Well... I guess I just didn't notice lol
---
Shows you how bad the game is set up though😂
---
Never played alliance so not super familiar with paladins, good to know.
---
I've always seen it as 30/21 instead of 31/20, dropping leader of the pack. Losing gift of nature and imp regrowth kinda sucks, but you can definitely still heal in 5/10 mans and low-tier MC groups without too much hassle. Just depends on how well geared the rest of the group is, and how fast you are trying to clear.
---
That's weird about the druid leveling, technically they should hit more often than warriors/rogues because they are treated as having max skill for their level while shape shifted. I haven't felt like I've had a problem with them, but I haven't leveled any other melee classes past 30. Plus, if it's doable on official servers (probably won't be) there's front shredding which is an absolute joke.
---
Just go shaman. They are more fun and groups love them for power melee speed clears I remember clearing living strat in 15 minutes.
---
I love the old graphics man.
---
Haven’t heard this one before lmao
---
[It might be, but phasing won't be.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w)
---
I never said Druid was bad at leveling, just my experience with it was a never-ending flurry of miss/dodge/parry. No, why would I be fighting mobs 3 levels above me?
---
&gt;  I don't teller a Druid being involved, so now we'll have to form a party and try some more stuff. We are all undead.
---
two mages and frost nova
---
They need to take step back and do a deep reflection. WoW doesn't feel "natural" as it used to, artifical cogs of time-sink mechanisms float like shipwreck debris - not subtly, under the surface like in Vanilla to Wrath. After all these years, for them to deduct through mistakes that sense of community is the ultimate binder.
---
In that case, I'd buy something used. You can build or probably buy a solid used system for $150. I've built 1080p low settings 60 FPS for &lt;$100 with a lot of scrounging, but $150 would get you a lot further.
---
More pet slots for hunters you only really have two pets till your max level then after you train all the skills you need you can fill the last slot to have 3 pets.
---
It was a cold winter morning during Christmas break. Saraxtoss, the orc warlock, was questing in the barrens when he noticed 4 alliance outriders.
---
“The alliance are raiding the crossroads! To arms!” He yelled in world chat. After giving his location, a mighty group of well over 30 horde (all levels 12-15 like himself) had formed and charged into battle!
---
Many who’d warriors died that day, and the bodies of the fallen literally blotched out the ground, but at last, the alliance was defeated.
---
A great cheer went through the crowd... followed by an angry yell from Stevey the level 26 Druid...
---
“Why the hell did you guys kill those? I needed them for a quest for Christ sake. Now I have to wait for the resplendent.”
---
To which twinkle toes the level 22 hunter replied: “wait.... those are nice? Who’s the asshole that told us we were getting raided?”
---
Saraxtoss had long since moved on to killing harpies in the north.
---
Thanks so much, Priest is something I'm interested in.
---
&gt; ran me through deadlines
---
take some holiday, my friend
---
I think rogues are harder. Did you mean to reply to the person above me?
---
That's, just, like, your, opinion, man.
---
&gt; world chat
---
pirate
---
Where do you post to discuss this stuff?
---
the problem was you were playing on a private server
---
well you don't really... the casuals have taken over im afraid 
---
I was responding to this:  "it's not like people can examine your talent points"
---
It's totally reasonable that we weill be ale to inspect talents or check the armory in Classic. They said they will keep minor UI changes that doesn't affect game plat like the mail system etc.
---
Druid needs to be with lock and hunter. Am druid, can confirm.
---
Bad and totally inacurate. Good job! -1
---
Didn’t know those existed in December of 2005
---
The classes are definitely messed up here.
---
Hah, even without having seen the original comic I can tell which military branch says what. I love the Special Forces one :D.
---
Yeah I also quit two weeks ago. BfA has everything I don't like about WoW. Only thing I miss is my friends and my Spectral Tiger. Now I have all the time to play good games I missed out on till Classic launches.
---
That game is trash.
---
I remember reading in the rules that "admitting on playing on a private server" was against the rules. I can't find it now though. Was in 2015 I read it.
---
Lmao, Deadmines *** thank you
---
Deploy the upvote !
---
My hopes are with Classic success = Blizzard opens progressions servers locked on specific expansions.  
---
So classic stays classic, TBC starts classic and ends TBC, WotLK starts classic, progresses through TBC, and ends WotLK, and so on.  
---
Leveling a Shaman isn't easy but is one of the most efficient levelers in the game provided you Earthbind kite everything know how to manage your regen and make smart pulls. 
---
Plus Mage should have a Chad and not Chad tier depending on if they AoE grind or not
---
You only have to be in the top 5% of mages so that when AoE grinding becomes available there isn't any competition.
---
Ye, people who wants to stay on classic realms should definitely have the opportunity to do so. 
---
Plus Azerite gear is the most stupid system they ever had. For the new raid you have to grind alot to re-gain that abilities you already had on the old gear.
---
I pitched this idea to a friend and he said quote "they won't nerf mages or anything or it would change the whole game" I still feel like blizz could possibly do something the nerf this strategy/exploit. I don't expect them to change anything, but I do believe it's possible. what do you guys think. do you think anything will receive a nerf/change?
---
And I personally would love to have at least three characters in each expansion.  
---
My protection warrior, my frost mage (arcane in WotLK) and my beastmaster hunter!
---
you made me lol
---
Can have some succsss AoE farming the start of brd and skimming the dogs and mining the dark iron ore. I don’t know how it compares to DM and it requires 2 professions
---
I have this really happy memory of Vanilla when playing my resto druid. Running Scholomance and pulls go bad, team is about to wipe. I pull off some heavy clutch healing and everyone lives, the whole group was back-patting me with "great heals!"
---
I wasn't doing much but topping off people and Innervating priests in raids, but that pug dungeon made me feel like an actual damn Healer for once.
---
Pretty shit honestly. 
---
With classic only being worked on by a skeleton crew (1/5th) of retails devs expect the launch to have a shit done of bugs.
---
BFA launched in a horrid state, expect that but worse. 
---
I only ever did a full Uldaman run ONCE, waaaay after I was past the top "recommended" level for it too (which I only did because it was one of the few instances I never saw the end of save the raids). 
---
Apparently it's a ridiculously hard end boss but, since I was in a good party and they had me, a decently geared rogue, we didn't have much trouble. 
---
Really looking forward to see if I get a group that does the entire instances this time around in the recommended level range. 
---
I followed people I thought were good or had seen or heard of, in bgs, in the same vain haha
---
especially in something like AV its like "oh no we're all gonna die!"
---
But what about Post Wotlk?  Should they make a complete new 3rd expansion. Cause cataclysm can't be 'reworked' in vanilla spirit I think, the evolution of the game has gone too far into a different branch here.  
---
I've told this story a few times, leveling in STV on my horde druid, lvl ? Rogue jumps me with ambush but fails to kill me, so I start travel forming and healing. He keeps chasing me but I'm not really doing much damage to him so I have a moment of inspiration. I run into the ocean he follows. I pretend I dont have seal form and just keep swimming down, he follows. Then I rooted him turned into a seal and swam away while he drowned.
---
Another great one I was playing priest and healing a BRD run, we were all outside the instance on the giant spire. The rogue in ny group will not shut up about how good he is at pvp just keeps going on and on. He challenges me to a duel, so I feared then MCed him and made him jump in the lava.
---
How has your experience been?
---
Pretty much reading what little official news there is about it, looking at this sub every couple of hours and researching the items i need/want and making an excel sheet of them (I'm doing the same for my friends who will be playing a priest and warrior). 
---
Are your friends hyped?
---
A few, yea, but not like me, but I don't think a lot of them played like I did back in the day, except one guy who was in a Nax guild who can't play now because he has kids. 
---
Are they on the fence?
---
A few are, but I've had other people show interest in playing but not sure if they're going to be as dedicated as we are. 
---
What's the reaction of your... SO? (ha)
---
I kept saying "we" throughout the post because my SO said she'd play with me!!! I'm really excited, found an MMO that she loves and we're playing it for practice in the meantime so she can get acclimated to the MMO atmosphere. 
---
Items that have "Critical Rating" instead of +1 Crit chance.
---
AOE grinding would be possible once you guys hit around level 35/40.  Paladin can gather initial aggro real easy (using shield of course and body pulls).  Then once you have all aggro, seal of light, consecrate (with righteous fury) and have mage go nuts.  
---
Alternatively, the mage could AOE grind with the paladin as support.  Blessing of wis, constant heals to stay up, BOP if things go bad.. Really either way you could do it.  In this scenario, it doesn't really matter the spec of the paladin. 
---
It's really hard to find AOE spots though, and sometimes you just kill all the mobs and have to wait for respawns.  You're probably better off doing a lot of quests together and AOE grinding occasionally when you hit a good spot.
---
doesn't rogue have to bandage between like every fight? 
---
Be sure to play dwarf for racial
---
Like Earthshaker’s Echoslam in Dota? That would be so nuts. Could wipe raids going to mc
---
are you sure?  I would think that if you are not ahead all kinds of annoying other classes would single tag kill the mobs you try to aoe all day long.  a mage might be able to fend of one random competitor by being more efficient, but if it's a swarm of levelers looking for anything to kill, you don't have a  chance. 
---
Great stuff! Are these from 2005/2006?
---
cata could be a a quest to stop DW from ever awakening, have to fight champions of every dragonight to convince them to join you in the fight, the less you recruit the harder the fight is but the better the drops
---
Glad to hear it, thanks for checking it out. 4H was by far my most time intensive guide to date.
---
This is true. While a lot of older players have preferences of vanilla, TBC and WotLK as their favorite part of WoW i do think that everyone can agree that cataclysm is where things took a drastic wrong turn
---
Same, played 'till 115 on launch day, then grinded some gold the following day to buy another token ready for Classic and haven't touched it since. Literally wasted 28 days worth of a token but oh well.
---
I don't think Blizzard can add anything to retail that would make the game as fun and engaging as it once was. I don't want to call it dead, but it's just very stale and boring.
---
Paradoxically, Classic wont add anything new either. But I'm sure we all know exactly why we're going back to it. The every so used word "community" and social interaction, which of themselves can add a whole new type of experience and gameplay. Something that Retail has been lacking for quite some time.
---
We're way overdue for a WoW 2.0 anyway, I have no idea why they haven't made one yet. I wont be holding my breath, though. 
---
I think because of latency or spell batching the spell would hit, but you still hit the ground and died. You'd hear the sound and maybe the animation would try to play but you'd impact and be obliterated.
---
I was a rogue trying to sap, gouge, kidney shot,  cheap shot, and blind.  Based on the idea in pvp if someone jumped you could stick them in mid air. So why couldn't we save someone as well? 
---
Agreed. Druids are one of the best levelers in vanilla
---
It took me about four runs to get through the entire thing. I'm convinced it's a cursed dungeon. I think Blizzard nerfed it pretty hard in BC, but fuck this place either way. 
---
Feral so fun to level.
---
there is an alternative for aoe grinding as a mage, but it's not feasible for a first character as it requires you to have  + spelldamage gear in all slots to really work.  (this is possible much earlier than people think because of al the random greens of 'fiery wrath' and 'frozen wrath' (you pick one and stick with it, fire is slightly better at low levels and frost is better at high levels because you can transform to aoe then)
---
This makes you a glass cannon, but that is no problem and it removes much of the drinking problem. you just kill with less spells cast. 
---
With a high level character to funnel the gear (you need to upgrade it at every opportunity)  this is a very nice way to level. I can recommend it for an alt. 
---
Wasn’t there is a mini tyrial too!?
---
Absolutely. Priests aren't that hard either and should probably be replaced by Shaman. But i seriously don't get people who think Rogue is hard. You pick up a sword, spam sinsiter strike and vanish if you over pull untill you get blade furry then you intentionally overpull to aoe a pack every time it's off cd. It's not that difficult.
---
If you accidentally needed it and then accidentally clicked "okay" when the screen says "Needing this item will permanently bind it to your character" then yes you would need to contact support 
---
Eh, I leveled a priest to 60 as holy and liked the way it sucked!
---
From what I've seen they can pretty easily keep an area on lockdown by tagging respawns with cone of cold and arcane explosion.
---
Because the /invite command has been in the game since 1.0 
---
the hardest part about raiding MC/BWL is getting 40 in a raid and staying there, not the encounters themselves...
---
I prefer older graphics. I don’t care if there’s a toggle for others though. I played the demo with the old graphics. I love pservers old graphics.
---
hmm.... if the cliff is high enough, you will catch midair
---
if the cliff isn't, you won´t get lethal damage
---
I don't think she'll want to just be a healbot while questing for 40levels. And at the rate we're able to play, lvl35-40 is a long time from now.
---
I was moreso wondering whether I should spec into frostbite and focus on single target bursting vs wait a couple levels and put a few points in imp blizzard and focus on multiple mob pulls. But based on this it seems like its probably better for me to go for a single target build, at least until we get to the level where she can respec into consecrate and we both focus on multiple mob pulls while questing.
---
Any experienced mages want to weigh in on this?
---
/shrug I was able to watch plenty of TV while leveling in vanilla.
---
Why would they nerf that? It was in vanilla so it should be in classic. 
---
it's almost as if this MMO was Turning into some type of "theme park" mmo, I know it sounds crazy and ridiculous but it is how I would describe the experience, they've turned our much beloved MMO into some type of, “video game” and not what it’s supposed to be.. I agree with poster
---
&gt;  I pretend I dont have seal form and just keep swimming down, he follows. Then I rooted him turned into a seal and swam away while he drowned.
---
that was undishonorable kill :Ð
---
&gt; I have this really happy memory of Vanilla when playing my resto druid. Running Scholomance and pulls go bad, team is about to wipe. I pull off some heavy clutch healing and everyone lives, the whole group was back-patting me with "great heals!"
---
basically my everyday daily deadmines heroic in cataclysm
---
that'S why I loved deadmines, but nobody wanted to do them, because everyone knew I'd fail on healing. Never failed.
---
I gotta say, the rating system as implemented in TBC (where gear wasn't homogenized yet) was an improvement over the system if Vanilla.
---
But I agree that it would be surprising to find crit/hit rating on gear.
---
Maybe at some point, but the original three were the mini diablo, zergling and panda.
---
Raiding is literally the most fun part in older expansions/vanilla. When you get a solid guild that progresses a little bit each week, they become some of your best friends. There is always something you need to farm, or an item that won't drop, or an alterac valley weekend to farm :) 
---
damn wowemu XÐ
---
\#nochanges btw
---
you are allowed to say Nostalrius on this reddit, but I avoid other names as my post have been removed by a censor script when I used a name in the past. 
---
AMERICA
---
It will be the 7.3.5 API with features disabled.  I'm guessing all addons will need to be redone (or at least 95% of them), either Vanilla addons to use the new API, or modern addons to use Vanilla databases and not use the blocked parts of the API.
---
I hope the addon makers get the API well enough in advance that they'll be able to make them.
---
Imagine thinking Mages aren't insanely good at leveling in 2019
---
All they'd have to do is make those specific mobs resistant to Arcane and that is it?  Why would you need to nerf any class when you could just make minor changes to DM. 
---
I'd advise Warlock if you fancy PVP this time round. They are monsters in PVP.
---
Sure. Mage DM averages 50g an hour I believe? Mining winterspring and searing gorge I averaged 40-45g an hour depending on gems and chest spawns. 
---
Don't forget a quiver for that increased wand speed. Handy trick for priest especially.
---
Shoutout to anyone from the Cerberus raid force on Earthen Ring EU, cos literally no other ingame experience has topped that one for me.  
---
Except Cajungumbo, you sucked and you know it :)
---
Oh, I don't think so. Can you source for your claim? Specifically for:
---
&gt; They make more with 1/10th or less subscribers
---
If that were the case, why would they release Classic in the first place instead of rather just continuosly offering new microtransactions for retail? Would be a totally wasted effort if your claim were true. 
---
It just doesn't add up. 
---
You’re confused. Efficiency isn’t forced in a game (certainly not this one). It’s developed. You develop it if you want to. You don’t have to watch that 10th guide some guy put out about leveling quickly  if you don’t want to.
---
People are really on here with pitch forks for theory crafters and min maxers. What kind of world..
---
Ohh. I always wanted a tyrial.
---
It's not that it sucks. It's just that it's a little boring. You're mainly wanding the whole time.
---
It's odd because I actually enjoy paladin leveling, but it's essentially the same thing as priest leveling, except instead of wanding you're just auto attacking.
---
Not sure why druid leveling is in the suck category. Druid leveling is great fun man. Speed boosts, practically unkillable, different forms to keep things fresh. I love me some druid leveling.
---
However, there are also an infinite amount of numbers between 1 and 2, which is where the majority of people will be.
---
Why is she playing a Paladin?  They're buffbots/healers.   If you think she'll get bored of that while leveling, then she'll get bored of Paladining at 60.
---
other classes with instant pull ability will pick off targets one at a time, and then the groups will get slightly different respawn times, and soon it will not be efficient anymore . (note I am talking about a situation with quite a lot of people trying to get a tag, not 1 or 2, but 5 or more. )  
---
This close was plenty high, right by the Tauren elevators at that camp in the middle.
---
We were doing this and trying to stop right before we hit the ground, it was instant death every time.
---
Pretty much.
---
+++++
---
Why would they need a full crew or anywhere near retail's size? There are a ton of components in retail WoW that Classic doesn't need. Everything is basically made, and most of the work is going to come down to coding, Quality, reverse engineering in general. Yes it's a big undertaking, but they're not making new content, they don't need new artwork, design, world builders, quest/dungeon/raid designers.
---
Single target burst probably is best.  You'll be very efficient this way.  I would say Ret for the paladin to do as much damage/threat as possible that way the pal can mostly hold aggro and mage can help nuking / polymorph adds etc.   
---
Fire or frost both have pros/cons.  If you'll be in groups so often, it probably just comes down to preference or 'what is cooler'.  
---
That's a great point. My SO and I have been playing games recently, and she really wants to play StarCraft II with me (She's completely green, and I ended up in Masters league multiple times.) The disparity makes it really boring for me, and really demoralizing for her. I've found that in cooperative experiences (Minecraft, Stardew Valley) things work out much better though. 
---
I was thinking about inviting her to play WoW Classic with me and a couple other RL friends, but I have a feeling that would be a bad idea.
---
Min maxers are the death of heart felt gaming 
---
If she goes Consecrate she could AoE tank while you AoE kill, but that might be less powerful due to her taking a bunch of damage that AoE kiting negates.
---
Alternatively, she could go ret and deal with specific enemies (particularly casters and ranged) while you grind the melee.
---
You would be amazed. I once raided in retail with someone who was casting chain heal on their totems. 
---
Which is why i do mostly dungeons. The times you get to play Shadow with free water from a mage are awesome. 
---
This feels like a promotional post for Project 1999, but not even that is very good, due to your aggressive tone towards vanilla. Maybe you should reconsider your approach, people here aren't necessarily fans of EQ, but they are fans of vanilla.
---
What does she plan to do at 60?  That will last longer than 40 levels.
---
You just aim for different non-set pieces.
---
If you want to dps as a warrior, i know truestrike shoulders and lionheart helmet are very desired - so don't worry, there's a TON of gear to choose from.
---
Casually travelling on the road in dusk wood, look back, see a big undead running towards me and die.
---
Sure was unexpected.
---
I don't like the timeline of this:
---
* 2019 - Classic Servers
---
* 2021 - Classic -&gt; TBC servers as classic
---
* 2023 - TBC unlocked
---
* 2025 - Classic -&gt; WotLK servers as classic
---
* 2027 - TBC unlocked again
---
* 2029 - WotLK unocked
---
It's gonna take 10 years to get WotLK that way, and we have to play through Classic thrice and TBC twice to get there.
---
Apparently 2019 is the death of logic.
---
G’day sir.
---
I don't trust Activision to develop a good game in a new direction.
---
Honestly if you are interested at all in pvp I would personally go Orc, although Tauren can pull off some nice combos with warstomp (see Wrexx or wrex forget spelling elemental shaman pvp video for more on this). I really still can’t figure out what’s better, but orc is a bit more rng since ur hoping you’ll resist stuns like intercept, cheapshot/kidney shot, IMp concussive/intimidation, hammer of justice etc, and rogues honestly don’t bother you that much due to this racial. it’s always fun when ur strafing and a warrior charges only for u to resist and still be running, hit em with a frost shock and then resist the intercept. They usually just rage quit right there. 
---
Don’t go troll, the impact in pve is honestly not worth losing the benefits of pvp racials. I know besetting could be useful in pvp but anyone who’s serious about pvp goes Tauren or orc for shaman. Horde wants many shamans for raiding and you will NEVER be discriminated Bc ur not troll. I know there’s that one dope ele pvp video of someone being troll but the pvp potential of orc/Tauren is unmatched. 
---
The trick, for Blizzard, would be to offer one free server transfer at the time of the opening of the new servers.  
---
Or a paid copy, so that they get money, and you get to keep your favorite toon on both servers!
---
Same, I figured out pretty quickly that this comic is making fun of the coast guards.
---
I was one of those frostwolf transfers!
---
From my point of view. Frostmane was an amazing server. Horde had several strong guilds like Militia and Groovestreet. Ally had Vicious Cycle and others. I was in the guild Reloaded, and had an absolute blast raiding. Yes ally had the advantage, but never did the server feel jacked up.
---
I guess since you were horde it felt bad going from being the stronger faction to the weaker faction. But on the other side of the coin...alliance frostmane natives were happy to become the stronger faction and have more players to create guilds/raids with. So really it’s all a matter of perspective... 
---
WotLK even isn't in the Vanilla spirit.  And even though I'd say TBC is, there are plenty of people who point to the linear zone structure, flying mounts, and heroic dungeons as ways TBC already started to deviate away from Vanilla.
---
Personally, I want to see Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK, and then go from there.  I think the nostalgia for Cata and onward is very small (since most of those who liked the changes in Cata are those who like changes period) and so the 4 groups are Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, and Live.
---
She typically plays healers in dungeons raids and pvp, but while questing she likes to hit things too. Which is the reason I made that comment.
---
Can't tell if being serious or not, but that's not opinion. Druids were laughably bad at launch. You could kill a pre-raid BiS geared druid as a level 50 hunter in greens it was that bad.
---
My main was an Enchanter, so I was going into Uldaman a lot.  
---
Needing binds the item to you, though. So you can't ninja and trade it.
---
Maybe 2 ninjas?  What game have you been playing?  I've seen more than that in a single dungeon run.
---
Support exists for accidental looting.  It does not exist for 4 players rolling "need" so the mage in their guild can get something over the priest who pugged with them.
---
This is a good point, I've noticed there are often a few ranged mobs mixed in with a bunch of melee while leveling so far.
---
Yeah a big issue to was that the scaling of mobs led to a decrease in power as you leveled up. You would smoke groups of mobs at 111, but that exact same group would end you at 119. It was such a backwards system. Then you hit 120 and instances were sweet, but the rng gearing is really bad. Azerite traits were a flop, but you still have to have the best ones to be competitive, and you can only get them past 340 iLvL from a weekly rng chest. 
---
The game basically decided instead of pumping out consistent good content to keep people playing, they would just make everything RNG so that you always had to be on and farming... it’s such a transparently fake way to keep you playing
---
The problem I see is it becomes a guild thing.  There's a big difference between the DPS warrior taking the tank's weapon, vs. 4 players rolling on an item so 1 guildy can get it.
---
AM I THE ONLY ONE!!!
---
No.
---
Most likely she will heal raids, dungeons, and pvp. We're just trying to be efficient for dungeons and quests for the short-mid term
---
Convinced me, gonna make a feralt
---
Its not that rogue is difficult its just incredibly slow just barely better then warrior and that's only due to stealth/cc 
---
We'll probably just continue what we're doing then, just wanted to make sure we were on the right path so we don't waste too much gold respeccing while leveling.
---
Paladins and Priests have almost zero down time. Paladins can't throw much of damage while Priest doesn't have to. In return this provides you with mp5. Ideally Priest can forget about drinking till 60; not sure about Paladin.  
---
Druid could be the same however constant shapeshifting drains mana. Shaman lacks Paladin's armor.
---
When the product is 100x more expensive, you can sell to 100x less people.

Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday will be current content clears which I dont expect to take the full 3 hours each night after the first few clears with Friday being a guild bonding day. Friday will be the day where we all group up together, do PVP, make dungeon runs, and just have fun with each other.

Community is huge for us. This is a main reason we're all going to classic wow. We want to give people a home, a place to level alts, a place to raid, and a place to get to know one another. Our primary goal is to stay relevant for all of classic wow. 
---
As far as guild structure and rule sets go here we are...  
---
We will not require a certain Raid attendance to stay in the guild, HOWEVER there will be a rank of MEMBER and a rank of RAIDER. The ONLY benefit that Raider has over member is that they are considered for raid invites first. To maintain the raider status you will have to be above a certain raid attendance threshhold that isn't set in stone yet. We understand that everyone is an adult now and has real life responsibilities. We understand that a lot of people cant and don't want to maintain a 100% RA in a video game and that is completely fine. We want to give everyone a chance to see the content that wants to actaully see the content but we dont want to punish the people by inviting someone with say 20% RA over someone thats there every single raid just because they were running behind one night or something.  
---
 The only other big structure that most people want to know about is loot distribution and how a guild plans on doing so. We will be using a DKP system that is also in the works. Nothing set in stone yet and we're willing to hear what a majority of people want. Randoming just isn't into consideration, and loot council we don't want to show favoritism to any person in the guild. Plus we want our normal people that cant maintain the "Raider" rank to be able to get loot as well. So there will be more discussions about the loot distribution that everyone can partake in. 
---
Thats pretty much it though, I think I covered everything. If you're interested in joining, send me a DM or join our discord with the link below! Looking forward to seeing everyone in Classic!

Ninjas aren't the problem.  Guilds are.
---
What's your strategy on learning code? I have all the time in the world right now and if I can find a way to work from home i'm doing it
---
Awesome, that sounds cool!  Good luck hunting! 
---
I think there is some cognitive dissonance in your last sentence. There are more ways to enjoy the game then being challenged by ignorance in PVE, or the challenge of being the best. Challenge isn’t what some seek at all.
---
For example: Role-playing, sitting around in the Barrens to chat, fishing simulator*, spending time with family/friends, engaging in a story, etc.
---
(*Arguably why most people will play Classic.)
---
Honestly, by the end of Vanilla, it had kind of evened itself out progression wise. Kinetic, Schism, Grove Street, Militia, Omertà were all great Horde guilds. I raided in Armatu, DHB, and Afterlife (and stopped raiding when Afterlife fully collapsed. Most of my guildies went on to raid Naxx/AQ 40 whereas I just pvp’d). But it was just brutal early on playing against Vicious Cycle and War Front on Alliance and swinging from the dominant side population-wise to bring severely outnumbered. And the major horde guild, Disband, lost its footing. I don’t have a problem with a server naturally being one way or the other, but to completely blow up the existing community like they did SUCKED.
---
Given the fact it comes out in a few months and we havent heard a word, im not hopeful there will be the same level of support
---
Good luck with that haha
---
but...you  use blizzard to kill them...
---
What is this you speak of?! 
---
It will only corrode the game if the majority of players are dicks in the first place, who like to go out of their way to abuse features to sobatage others.
---
The main "culprit" in progressive itemization is patch 1.10, which is the patch that added /upgraded loooooooads of blue dungeon items, making them generally better than MC /even BWL items, and some on par with items all the way up to naxx. 1.10 is a late vanilla patch, so not "a few months" like you are saying. My main problem with not progressively releasing itemization like this, is not even that MC will be easier, it's that people will get 90% of their bis from dungeons and keep using those items all the way to AQ40/naxx often times. We know blizzard is doing progressive CONTENT release, which means for the first ~1 year of vanilla, your bis gear will be aquired mainly from lvl 50-60 5 man dungeons, there will hardly be any upgrades from MC/bwl at all, and you'll have to wait until AQ40 release before raids actually start giving worthwhile loot that outclasses your dungeon blues. This is a very valid concern imo. 
---
Whaaaaaaat?!
---
You bring up a very valid point... I think it will be worth getting ganked no matter what
---
Maraudon isnt bad, preferrably combine with herbalism for ghost mushroom.
---
If everything was basically made and ready to go, it would have been out in the summer of 2018
---
That makes more sense than what was posted.
---
As a paladin I use hammer a lot when people try to jump off the LM in ab, especially mages or priest that can spam slowfall/levitate etc.  They're sitting there in midair, make a great target for folks and then they don't have the buff once the stun wears off (since buff breaks on damage ofc =p)
---
The combo my friend and I use for a ret paladin is a smite priest.  Go go JoSanc.
---
You gotta take Asmon with a grain of salt... Or 2.  He's almost a Character himself.  He is a cocky entitled guy, but his points and commentary are usually spot on. 
---
Transparency. Fairness. Selectiveness \[Probably not a word\].
---
Always think about what you want your raid roster to look like. How many tanks? Healers? Ranged DPS vs Melee DPS? When you invite some one to the guild, make sure they want to raid. Make sure they feel they can make the raid days you plan on raiding. People who join the guild should have the expectation that they will be 'required' to be a part of the raid team and raid during specific hours. There won't be any surprises down the road on the guild's expectations.
---
When the bulk of your guide is 55+ re-evaluate your roster and then try and target recruit areas where you think you are weak. Set "raids" for doing pre-raid BIS farming for the guild. Get them used to logging in for "raid time" and working together by making LBRS/UBRS/Strath/Scholo nights where you (and/or officers) make groups for gearing/keying/xping. Diversify the groups, make sure the same people aren't always in the same group \[especially all officers\]. One good trick is to pair 2 to 3 already well geared/experienced players with 2 not geared/inexperienced players. The groups will be more balanced and people will get geared as a collective faster.
---
Then, when you are ready to raid, your guild already logs in for raid times. It is not a new behavior, and they know each other. They know how to work with each other and the transition should be smooth.
---
In 2005 we had a website/forum/ventrillo. We put up instructions there for raids, we had all our rules laid out for all guild mates to read and it was understood that those rules were how the guild worked and that was it. This is how loot is handled. This is when we raid. This is how we choose who raids. These are the expectations we have on our raiders. Etc. Etc.  Maybe Discord can do all that now? I am not familiar with it.
---
Being a guildmaster takes a lot of work. You need 2-4 people you feel you can trust and have the same vision as you do for what the guild should be to help you out. Guild leader should not be a raid leader. You should also have a back up raid leader for if the main raid leader can't raid for a night. You should have a back-up main tank too. Don't rely on one person to perform the key roles your guild will need.   
---
I could probably go on and on with pointers based on my experience as a officer and guild leader from 2002 in EQ through 2009 in WoW. I loved the organizational/social aspect of being a guild leader. It is not for everyone tho.
---
Make him resto druid heal you as a warrior... Most fun I've ever had in BGs
---
just as a cursory glance this looks like the powerpoint slides put into document format.
---
 &gt; First off, you really shouldnt be dedicating a vacation to this.
---
Definitely need to dedicate vacation time to what a random redditor thinks.
---
Every day that classic gets closer I get a bigger pit in my stomach that Activision Blizzard will find a way to ruin it... I do not have much hope for Blizzard and/or WoW/ClassicWoW
---
well honestly most classes spam 1-2 buttons in raids (apart from some cds), not much different with healers.
---
Druids are one of the fastest levelers starting around lvl 20, beofre they suck though...
---
I would recommend you rolling shaman, knowing when and where to place the totems can be challenging and they are the most sought after healer on horde side (because totems only affect your party).
---
Teir 2.5 had Crit Bonus. The ideal sets for non traditional/off spec are not in the teir sets, even BIS is often not the full teir set for the primary spec. Classic itemization is.... not fully realized and thus you'll have to be a bit creative with your gear choices.
---
&gt;b is a fantasy land for littl
---
WOD baby?
---
Funny story, had me in stitches
---
If you think the Classic community will mostly consist of despicable human beings, then sure, that concern seems reasonable.
---
I for one believe that such persons are an absolute minority, my experience back in the day and nowadays in retail. 
---
Right after vanilla EU launch (sometime early 2005) i was a level 20 hunter on the boat in menethil. A level 46 human paladin approached me on the boat, traded me 103 gold and said he was quitting the game, then logged off. Like 1 month after vanilla release, 103G was a legit insane amount of gold. 
---
Much later, in early TBC, i recieved a mail. It contained 50,000 gold and just said "From: Unknown" needless to say this was also an absolutely ridiculous amount of gold. I never figured out why someone sent me that gold, figure it was prob some poor gold seller sending it to the wrong guy. I immideatly travelled to shadowmoon and bought epic flying for myself + 2 irl friends, fearing blizz was gonna ban me haha. 
---
Zero QoL changes is my favorite QoL change.
---
Hey at least the mage has conjured water. Other classes have to spend a fortune on buying food and drinks.
---
Hi, /u/evd1202
---
I literally paid someone to level for me to $120, I couldnt do it.
---
It was so boring, I played maybe for a month at 120

Name checks out... 
---
Yeah, I like how some kids instantly take things to an extreme edge and say well look its broken. LOL.  There were trolls and grievers always in every stage of WoW. People talk about some hypothetical scenarios that happen once in a blue moon.  (Twice in ten years, in your example).  But that is this current generation of spoiled babies/princesses... 
---
I’m doing this thing with treehouse.com for the basic course to see if I even like coding. It’s 25 a month for a sub, so it’s 10 more than what I pay for with wow. 
---
I also got suggestions from friends to do freecodecamp, but I need some form of structure than just doing me.
---
I also play streams of programmers on YouTube in the background and just listen to their conversations, and podcast like Programming Throwdown. That way I can become more familiar with certain things. Idk if it’s a good strategy as it’s part time but I’m enjoying learning. 
---
lol, yup.  These are good for a quick laugh
---
Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle.  At first glance it doesn't look good.  But let me tell you, it is GREAT.  If you like XCOM (it's a lot simpler) you may end up loving it.
---
I also play GuildWars 1.  It's running in maintenance mode but the game is still alive.  I played GW1 before WoW and it has been my off again, on again game.  There is so much content, it takes years upon years to achieve.  So many builds to play with, theory crafting, and testing the builds yourself.  It's an amazing game and my description of it will never do it justice. 
---
I played a few days of Beta 3 and then got the game on launch day along with 3 other friends. I played game religiously (like most of you) through all of vanilla. It was my best experience with the game. It was just so unforgiving and hardcore. It got me totally hooked to MMO's way more than Star Wars Galaxies already had.
---
Then Burning Crusade came out and I was there at Gamestop at midnight for the launch because I was so hooked on WoW at this point. I got it, went home, killed some boars in Hellfire Peninsula on my Undead Priest and logged out. I didn't feel like leveling for a few weeks, for some reason. Then I played a Tauren Druid (would have preferred Night Elf, but friends wanted Horde) and tanked basic easy raids. I think Gruuls Lair, Karazhan, Mags Lair, and Zul'Aman were all I did. I kinda stopped playing for the rest of the expansion, and I'm not entirely sure why. I think the game world started shrinking too much at this point for me to continue enjoying the game. Everyone was basically just congregated in Shattrath City anyway, and Outland only had 7 zones. Sure, they were REALLY BIG, but I didn't care for that. I preferred the smaller more numerous zones in vanilla that were all drastically different from one another. It just made the world feel much more alive and shrouded in mystery. I was done with The Burning Crusade somewhere near it's end, but in all honesty, probably would have picked it up and played it again, over and over in a cycle.
---
Then Wrath of The Lich King came out and I had to try the new expansion. I did enjoy this expansion quite a bit, despite it having the same small number of zones like Burning Crusade had. I think Blizzard just got the scourge feel correct with WoTLK. I didn't care much for Northrend, but the dungeons were just outstanding. I think this expansion has all my favorite dungeons in it. I was always the kind of player that ran every dungeon I could, even when I had 40 man gear in vanilla, I still enjoyed doing BRD, UBRS, LBRS, and most others. WoTLK was great and I never got burned out on it's dungeons and raids. 
---
After these expansions, the game was just dead to me. I logged into Cataclysm and the game just felt way too different, and I didn't give it the full open mindedness I could have, but that's because I hated how Blizzard changed the landscape of Azeroth. It just felt too 'streamlined' or something like that to me. I can't put it into words, but it wasn't the hardcore, mysterious, dangerous feel that the world use to have. It was just different, and very absent. I only played perhaps 5 hours of Cata.
---
When MoP came out, I didn't even play. The entire Kung Fu Panda feel killed the entire expansion for me.
---
I played Warlords of Draenor for a few months and I knew the game wasn't anything like what it use to be. It was hard for me to think of it as World of Warcraft, being that it underwent so many drastic changes, but it was something to kill time with anyway. I never got much done in WoD. I didn't care for the game really.
---
In Legion I tried so hard to get into the game. I told myself, "I'm really gonna commit and make this my mainstay. I'm gonna learn my class and get through all the content at endgame." I didn't, though. I just couldn't play it seriously when I compared it to classic, TBC, and WoTLK. I do really believe that the biggest thing that turned me off to the game in this expansion and a few of the past ones, was the change to talents going from trees to being streamlined. Some people thought the trees had useless and bloated talents, and they were right. Those were a prerequisite to getting the good abilities from them, though. They gave you 51 points to customize your class as you saw fit. You could be so many different types of a rogue, or a warlock. At this point in WoW, everyone just seemed to be the same class, same old everything else.
---
I hit max level in BFA, logged in one more day, and then logged out and cancelled. I'll never go back to this game until we get classic.
---
Nothing wrong. You just seem very very angry and very much like no matter what they do, you won't be happy with it. At that point in time, you might as well figure out how to put up your own classic wow server and say screw them then you can have it exactly the way you want. These games are meant to relax and Recreate us. If we are unwilling to compromise on Little Things, and there won't be anything for anybody. And truth be told ninja looting is just a situation of assholes and 14 year olds. We can all just breathe and ignore them. Sure on occasion someone will manage the ninja loot something, and when they do this ever gets told that the person has been ninja looting everybody knows it and they don't let the person anywhere near them. If they create a new tune the same thing happens to the new tune if they don't behave themselves. We are going to have to do a lot of the policing that the GMs used to do; or blizzard will decide it isnt worth the hassle. Just saying... breath and hopefully we get the best classic wow we can.
---
Same level of support as what?
---
If we're talking about the absolute difficulty of pressing buttons, WoW is not hard. Rogue is just harder than the majority of classes.
---
wtf
---
But they're not slow at all, they don't even come close to warriors. Priests, shamans, paladins and warriors are all slower by quite a lot. whenever i level a rogue to 60 i barely use stealth at all in the first place, range pulling or just running straight in to spam ss is just faster. With a proper combat spec with riposte that goes from mace/sword to sword and some bandages you have pretty much zero downtime and will kill mobs incredibly quickly.
---
It's perhaps a bit anecdotal but my fastest 60 speed is with a rogue in 6 days and i wasn't even trying to go fast in fact i had a lot of time at 36 just being an alchemy mule, they're far from slow. 
---
This reeks of "rogues are the most nerfed class in the game".
---
Lack of self control, huh? Sweet jesus. Most of the "efficiency obsessed" people actually enjoy playing the game that way without going for e-peen speedruns. It's actually fun for people to have stronger characters. Imagine that.
---
Uh... thats pretty realistic actually.
---
When the solo pvpers realize how awful vanilla BGs are they will stop queueing. Happened to me on my first private server, and WSG was one of the things I looked forward to the most. People know how to game the system now- BGs will be NOTHING like how players experienced them during retail vanilla. The no changes crew doesnt seem to understand that identical code =/= identical experience.
---
the early PvE content is not tuned for the 1.12 talents and gear, as you suggest in 2. 
---
yes, even if they release it patch by patch, the game wont be very hard. but they could atleast make some effort to not have MC and BWL be a total joke. and a good way to do that is gate huge DPS items that were released with bwl patch, or zg, or aq or naxx. its a very simple way to do it. in addition to that, it creates more incentive for the player to go back to DM or UBRS or Strat or whatever, later in the game, say at AQ release. this isnt too hard to understand. its healthy for the game since it keeps people playing - that is good for the casual player and the hardcore player.
---
Hmm well mayne if youre lucky you make that much mining. But on highly populated private servers theres lots of competition for mining nodes, where soloing Dire Maul is guaranteed competition free.
---
You know what I'm saying though. They only have to adjust those mobs so their health+ resistances is greater than something like 5k mana and you kill DM farming. 
---
I approve highly of theory crafting. I'm talking about stealing others' ideas as a means to get ahead
---
Every other, basically, but yeah.
---
VIEW DISTANCE, 2004 VIEW DISTANCE WAS LIKE 12 FEET. 
---
I WANT TO SEE THE WHOLE ZONE. 
---
CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
12.0 feet ≈ 3.7 metres ^(1 foot ≈ 0.3m)
---
Vanilla Paladins may have zero down time while leveling but, goodness fucking me, are they boring.
---
You basically just put on a Seal and Auto-attack for over half of the leveling experience. You can obviously use Judgement but you can't use it too frequently while leveling or you'll oom.
---
(Posting my comment from another thread)
---
I remember I installed the game to play with some friends, and I decided upon a Night Elf Hunter. As we all did, I spent the first bunch of levels being confused and excited about everything being so interesting. Around the time I reached level 10, one of my friends who had a 60 Hunter has this conversation with me:  
---
Him: "Hang on in Auberdine for a minute, I'm on my way."  
---
Me: "Why?"  
---
Him: "I'm taking you somewhere else so you can get better rewards for questing and it has an instance."  
---
Me: Hmmm...wonder what an instance is, but sure why not.  
---
He shows up about 15 minutes later in AWESOME looking armor (It was Dragonstalker gear it turned out) and riding a cat, but gets on foot when he gets close to me. He shows me to the Auberdine boat, where about 10-15 others were waiting to hop aboard when it arrives.  
---
It shows up, we hop on, and wait for it to take off. Suddenly my loading screen shows what is happening, that I am going allllll the way from northwest Kalimdor to the Eastern Kingdoms, and I set foot in Menethil Harbor in the [Wetlands](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=11/wetlands). That was pretty neat! He shows me to the Flight Path to click on it, and then we start heading out of town.  
---
We start running on foot and I am trying to keep up. Suddenly Alligators keep coming from EVERYWHERE and seemingly miles away to attack me, but my friend picked them off. We keep walking for miles and miles, and I am bewildered at how huge this area is, and that alligators with a skull listed instead of their usual level had a serious problem with me. Eventually, we come into a tunnel that keeps going up, and up and up....and coming out of one of the tunnels I see my very first orc...a [Dragonmaw Scout](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=41080/dragonmaw-scout). My friend kills it, and runs by where he was stationed. I looked at the corpse, then to the right and saw a whole bunch more...."Wow, is that an orc base for players?"  
---
We keep going, one more tunnel to go, and at the end of it we have reached [Loch Modan](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=38/loch-modan). Man, we have gone so far already, where could he be taking me? We go down the road, and start seeing some dwarves, and random monsters, and I could at least see their levels again.   
---
We keep trekking, I grab the flight path at the dwarf town but we are already on our way again.  
---
Me: "Should I grab these quests while I'm here?"  
---
Him: "Nope, we keep going."  
---
Me: "Dang, this game is pretty huge."  
---
We head through another tunnel, and it's snowy on the other side. Looks pretty neat! We've entered [Dun Morogh](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=1/dun-morogh). The monsters are low level, but we stuck to the road the entire time so I didn't see much of the area. He takes me up a path that leads into the mountain...  
---
We have arrived at [Ironforge](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=1537/ironforge). My computer starts to slow down and get choppy, as if it is having a heart attack. We go through the entrance where a bunch of people are attacking each other and there's flags everywhere. \*shrug\*, I'll see what that is all about later.  
---
We go through the Ironforge entrance and my computer is dying at first, loading something big. As the area opens up, I am awestruck. This area is huge! It's a city in a mountain! There are SO many people EVERYWHERE. I don't even know what is going on but this is CLEARLY the place to be. The chat channels are lively with a lot of repeating words like "Scholo need key" and "AD scourgestone farm group" gibberish. I keep looking around, but my friend beckons me to join him. It's not over yet.  
---
He takes me through the Military Ward and into the center to pick up another flight path, but then back down and around to Tinker Town and through some weird swirly portal into the [Deeprun Tram](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=2257/deeprun-tram). I zone in and shortly after, the tram shows up. I get on it, it takes off, and are you kidding me? WoW has a subway? It stops, and we zone in to [Stormwind City](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=1519/stormwind-city)...  
---
That music! It's so amazing. It reminds me of the human theme added in the WarCraft III: Frozen Throne expansion. Anyways, another huge place, not as lively as Ironforge but pretty big and really neat. We go through the Dwarven District, through Old Town and then the Trade district and into the Valley of Heroes, and wow those are HUGE statues! I would later examine them only to be awed, finding out they are the heroes from a game I played when I was a kid, WarCraft 2.  
---
We continue through to [Elwynn Forest](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=12/elwynn-forest). The music is very pleasant, sounds like not much going on here. Instead of following the road this time, my friend veers off and we start traveling along the mountain ridge west and go to the barracks. Cool! Once again, I've seen these before in the WarCraft games!  
---
We go past it, and up ahead the fields are brown, and different. We cross the bridge, and I am in [Westfall](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=40/westfall). This time, my friend tells me to pick up the quests that the Furlbrows had, like helping 📷[ Poor Old Blanchy](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=151/poor-old-blanchy). He tells me to pick up any quests I see from here on out, and we walk past some farms and into Sentinel Hill. There are tons of low level players here, and chat is once again lively with "VC group starting" and "where is the [Defias Messenger](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=550/defias-messenger)?"  
---
My friend takes me to the inn, tells me to set my Hearthstone here, and says "alright, off you go, enjoy!".   
---
It took about an hour or so to travel from Auberdine to Westfall, and boy was it worth it. (I would later find that messenger, do that VC run everyone keeps talking about, and get jaw-dropping gear upgrades that made me feel awesome.)  
---
This was January 2006, one week after receiving World of WarCraft for Christmas. It is the most vivid WoW memory I have from then, one that many others have likely shared. It's been a long time since that day, and every once in a while I travel back here to listen to the music and enjoy the scenery. All of my alts went through here ever since. Westfall may not have been my starting point, but it's at the heart of my early enjoyments and remains a very special place for me, Cataclysm changes and all. 
---
Exactly.  Well said.
---
The thing is that scenario IS technically possible so in their minds these people think it will be happening ALL the time.
---
If Blizz could make the game exactly as these complainers want there would be countless number of exploits... 
---
Anyways... Some people need to use their brain a little more these days instead of going and complaining about things right away like little entitled brats.
---
I doubt they'll make loot tradeable that has been won by a need roll
---
All I'm saying is you don't need a crew the size of retail to do this project, and if it's only 1/5th the size the that sounds like an appropriate number to me.
---
It's like if you find an old dusty handwritten book, and you need to type it up. Yeah it's going to take a bit of time to type it up, and some parts may be difficult to read, but basically all the creative decisions have already been made. Your not going to have to put in the same amount of manpower as the original author. 
---
They're only slower or harder than mage, warlock, hunter and druid while faster than the other four. So they're right in the middle. Hardly a majority.
---
3440x1440 videos didn't existed in 2006. That's from 2018, so it's an example of how it's done today on third-party vanilla semi-reimplementation ;)
---
I feel we will probably see a lot of bug fixes and NPC adjustment. I may be misremembering, but im pretty sure they said its not going to be 100% classic, its going to be a newer version but they will try and stay consistant with no changes.
---
They are already going to be bringing it to the current engine, so that alone may smooth out a lot of things that were common in Vanilla. I dont think we will see many TBC additions though (*though there are things I like like auto-loot, I understand why it isnt there and am not too bothered by it*)
---
What if the buff was suppressed while moving but not removed?
---
That’s funny because I have played p servers ever since nost and I am a solo que-r and I haven’t noticed this at all.  You hit a ‘couple’ premades a night if you que all night normally.  Also, if you are taking the ‘they didn’t know any better back in vanilla’ stance then this conversation is already pointless.  At no point has 90% of people queing bgs being a premade been a norm.  It hasn’t changed on pservers and there is no reason it would change now.  
---
If you think it will that’s fine.  Just realize this would have to go against every grain of history that is set in stone. 
---
I don't think its replicable on Pservers for the reason you mention, but in vanilla I'd often farm weekday nights when the server was quietest. And sometimes I wouldn't give me any crystals etc so wasn't a good night but other nights i'd get a ton. Its certainly not as reliable or perfect DM but as a prot warrior it was fine.
---
Retail
---
., Most Memorable was a big RP Event in the Gurubashi Arena with a 1vs1 Fight between my Guildmaster and the Rival Guilds Guildmaster, with over 200 in the Arena watching both Horde and Alliance (yes no one disturbed the Event, that's how diciplined RP Servers were back in 2005)
---
., Most Unexpected: I've never expected to find Undercity as a Young Lvl 7 UD Mage back in the Beta in 2004 :&gt; But hey in the End i did it :D
---
., Most Magical: Clearly when i first found Azshara. My Favorite Zone from Vanilla btw. So Beautiful, Mystical and Terrifying at the same time.
---
most of the live retail crew, is more than likely artist and programmers, because classic alredy has the art done, and programming completed, the only things missing is scripting and database stuff, arguably the things that take the most time to do properly if they truly wish to replicate the 2004-2006 experience, that's why it's going to be shit, 6 months is not enough time for a small team to get everything right. Just by the ammount of bugs in the demo, the release on summer is pretty much fucked.
---
That’s a private server thing only. It didn’t actually exist in vanilla.
---
Modern raid frames - The new modern raid frames are really nice, they are simple but have pretty much everything you need and look clean. I have seen quite a bit of outrage about the raid frames being in the demo and hoping they wont be in the actual game but LITERALLY EVERY video i have seen in vanilla raiding or PVP uses addons for better raid frames as the default vanilla raid frames are complete dogshit and pretty much unusable. Modern raid frames would not change anything but cutting out the part where you have to download an addon....
---
Wth is wrong with you [astralduelist](https://www.reddit.com/user/astralduelist)
---
Was gonna say, if there is any exploit/fix I would think it would be for hunters farming tribute, not mages farming greys on trash mobs.
---
and realistically, you'd crash the market if you bought 12k like the dude a few up mentioned and it would never take off. Unless you want to be the new pizza guy... 
---
New conspiracy, pizza guy is a time traveler from a timeline where bitcoin never succeeded due to no one spending any. Jumped back in time to kickstart the spend.
---
Good to hear it man.  That game is only good for insta gratification little princesses
---
It would be cool to redesign some of the gear, some models could be improved 
---
It's all about priorities.  If you're a guy who clearly takes care of himself and his job as a priority it will show.  If you want to talk about your hobby from that platform nobody will judge you.  But if you're a guy who lets the game get in the way of hygiene, fitness, and your job's responsibilities that stigma will stick to you, and if others judge you on it you're in no place to argue back because hey after all they are right..  Play time comes after responsibilities are done.. no exceptions.
---
22 years and this is the first time I've heard of this, too.
---
This is not minor though, it’s pretty gamechanging in guild politics and a lot of social things not to mention the whole idea of gearing being a hard long grind which feels rewarding in the end when youre decked out in BiS
---
I was a level 22 Human Mage on a PvP Server (Scilla) and I was exploring Stonetalon Mountains. On one of the trails, I ran into a level 28 Orc Warrior. We stared at each other for a few seconds. I waved; he charged.
---
The next ten minutes became a blur of popping health pots, mana pots, and frostbolt kiting this poor sap up and down the pass. With each hit, I whittled away his life, maintaining my distance. With each charge, I bled that much closer to death. 
---
Ultimately, with less than 50hp to go, I sunk the final hit and got my HK. Needless to say, I screamed victory at my monitor and proceeded to got the hell out of dodge, heading to safer pastures in (lol) the Desolace.
---
Camping in Elwynn with my friend at around level 5
---
And getting my first gold 
---
this isnt a minor quol change tho? it changes the social dynamic A LOT, which is one of the biggest aspects of the game, thats why they already confirmed its not happening
---
Not to mention a lock can go solo questing without ever getting OOM. Thats a massive time difference.
---
I wouldn’t really say “harder,” but warlocks have pretty much no downtime between having a pet, life tap, and drain life. Meanwhile a mage will spend a lot of time drinking, especially in those awkward levels right before they learn new water conjuring spells.
---
I'm in the same boat.. nothing is left but the waiting.  I quit bfa and private servers and really just focusing on getting myself personally to a place where a couple weeks no-lifing it up won't get in the way of other plans.  Very excited but lots of waiting ahead.
---
Was gunna try to play but I need an actual copy of the game Everquest to emulate it lol...
---
What’s weird to me in this; I never felt weak in the first place. Compared to level 1 in vanilla vs level 1 now (even without heirlooms) - I can just rampage through enemies for half an hour and just heal up passively. Now compare 110-120, sure I guess I feel the same, but never once since the new xpac did I feel weak or weaker. Just felt stagnant. Cool badass dinosaurs? Sure lemme pull a pack of 20 and just kite it out. Then do the next 6 quests. 
---
The old graphics establish a better environment than the newer higher res ones IMO. The new graphics have a bad art style that is too dark in some places and too bright in others. Vanilla on that other hand has lower res, but at least the style is solid.
---
I was undergeared on my dwarf priest and didn't have an epic weapon yet. My biggest desire was to get the Will of Arlock. Well it finally dropped and everyone in the guild starts rolling on it. I'm sad because I'm not going to win and I end up losing the roll to a warrior or hunter. Then I see in chat that the Will of Arlock was given to me by the master looter. Half the guild gquits immediately and I start freaking out. Turns out the guild was playing a trick on my and it was all a joke. Still got my snake staff though and kept it all these years. 
---
You seem to be confusing the LFG tool with LFD/LFR.
---
Yes, but doing so limits your DPS.  It's not a complete 1:1 trade, but it does offset the speed boost marginally.
---
This does theoretically suck.
---
But if you have 3 rogues in one 10 man, how many other players in your group are really going to be needing that weapon? The fourth player  goes into that group already knowing that there are three  rogues who will roll against them when the group starts. They know the odds before they join the group. They join knowing that if the Dal'Rend dropped he/she would be one in 4 rolling on it. From the person getting unknowingly cheated, it doesn't matter who wins the roll. It is either the 4th player or not the 4th player.
---
LFG/LFR icons TRIGGERED
---
This guy fucks
---
You'll need a flux capacitor first.
---
to be fair.. i stopped playing there so I wouldn't be 'over it' when classic comes out.. I'm sure quite a few people are in the same boat as me.  If that was all that was going to be available for the foreseeable future I would still be playing there.
---
I hadn't played WoW since Vanilla and decided to hop back in at the end of Legion.  I got all excited for BfA thinking finally the game might be 'fixed' and encourage better PvP but it became even worse.  Left about 2 months into the expansion.  Fuck that, I'll wait for Classic now.
---
Great story :)
---
i think classic servers will see a different population fluctuation than private servers tbh. And I rememebr for example when nostalrius relaunched into the server starting with E, which was by far the biggest priv server launch ever (13k online concurrent with 25k+ in queue constantly) the pop did die down over the next months and fell to like 6-7k concurrent peaks, but then as time continued, and patch 1.5 (AV), 1.6 (BWL) and 1.7 (zg etc) released, the population started climbing again, up to like 10k peaks for several months. So it's not like vanilla servers have a constant, gradual decline in population. It's more like a rollercoaster going up and down as patches are getting old/new ones being released. Also just the fact that classic wow there will be none of the fears that server might shut down etc which plagues private servers hype. And in classic they can do server merges etc. 
---
I would say the tiers sets are for certain specs.  Though the tier 0.5, pvp sets, zg set, and there aq set usually mixed it up. 
---
Other than that there is plenty of gear to choose from without going for a specific set. 
---
Its the air force in the final pic. 
---
Sure but I dont think anyone would call competing for mining nodes "comparable to mage farming DM". 
---
Also, you make it sound like this is some apecial prot warrior strategy you found that "leverages the strengths of your class". Pretty sure you were a warrior, so you had mining. So you mined areas. This isnt like omg warriors are optimal class for mining bc they have fear and tanky!!! Or like omg only warriors can farm these nodes. 
---
Lol I don’t mind it. Was a tough hurdle for me to get over. Since I considered that game an investment and the return was joy/fun. Well the illusion of that from the amount of hours I put into old content took awhile to wipe off. Even fell for the “Disney vault” shit. Oh well. Gotta learn somehow lol
---
Or learn how to use a torrent 
---
I don’t care if anyone plays p99 or not, I don’t even play there anymore. 
---
Can’t handle a real game?
---
Blackcock Mountain... everyone's favorite dungeon hub.
---
many bosses require more explanation (especially if you've never seen the fight) than 2 mins. even in sub naxx. Sure you could tldr them for a specific class for role but overall no.
---
Chromag, skeram, bug family, harbinger, twin emps, shazz, and there are more. 
---
Sure you could tell a melee "hey just kill skull on harbinger" or "stay away from the melee boss on emps" but that doesn't mean they know what is going on or WHY they are doing it. Yes, if you have someone new and you're at the boss give them the tldr but actually explaining all the parts of the fights, in &lt;2min is hard. Some fights of course not but there are plenty of "easy" fights that need explaining to not wipe. 
---
Having everyone in the raid understand the mechanics across the board is required for adapting when shit doesn't go smooth. 
---
MT dies on ouro? 1-a couple warrior needs to macro a shield and 1h, and try and hit the boss and turn him away not keep smacking him. If they don't know the mechanics they will stand there and dps and wipe. 
---
It's funny because it's true.
---
Easily rogue. 
---
Never said that, I found what made money for my main spec. There is a ton of meta on this board that you have to level a mage or hunter to make money which just isn't true. 
---
Guild bank
---
Dire Maul (1.3) ZG (1.7) were in the game way before that, which is still very early in the game timeline. It has exactly the same effect you are talking about.
---
&gt; My main problem with not progressively releasing itemization like this, is not even that MC will be easier,  it's that people will get 90% of their bis from dungeons and keep using those items all the way to AQ40/naxx often times
---
It's wrong exactly because of what I explained in another comment. Most people were in the case you are describing. Most people actually got that catchup gear instead of the "true order" gear. Because most people either **1) began playing late in the game timeline 2) Took their time to level up, to do quests, to farm reputations, to do PvP instead of PvE**. No one noticed "oh damn, that content is easier than expected..".
---
Reactions to people suggesting harmless features like achievements reminds me of this:
---
https://i.redd.it/pamvnk4kwda21.png
---
It doesn't affect you at all if you don't like achievements.
---
Wasn't facestabbing confirmed not to work in classic since its legion client? Without that its under mage 
---
Very little down time as a druid, even if you are shifting often.  You level as cat, and only come out to heal yourself, and if you're low on mana you innervate. 
---
Yeah I can see how that would have been very frustrating. I just wanted to pop in and give my two cents that I had a positive experience from transferring, and felt the server was very enjoyable.
---
Frostwolf was a few months older than frostmane, which did make it unfair for the frostmane natives. I hope in the future blizzard would recognize this, and only allow transfers to servers of the same age/progression. 
---
priests has the biggest variety of spells, and the least boring healer. read some guides, so you have an idea. you have 1.5 flash heal. and you dont need to always spam greater heal. in general reading some guides on all healer and pve healing will help, and give you an idea see what intrest and excite you.
---
as a shaman you use three ranks of chain heal, for different situations so you dont oom, also obviously gear helps, i wouldnt really say shamans oom faster than other healers or use more mana pots. its a wierd claim. 
---
the whole mastery of healing in vanilla, is to manage to heal and not oom fast. 
---
I guess I misinterpreted the setup instructions then, mind PMing me a good torrent to use? I'm curious to try EQ
---
Don’t even consider leveling when making your choice, I mean, unless that’s the most important aspect of classic to you. Think of what you want to do at 60, what role you want to play, etc. do you want to be fearing mobs and cc’ing, playing ranged dps, or melee? Do you want the summoned mount? Does up close, intense pvp suit you, or do you prefer to dot/fear and watch your enemies’ life tick away?
---
It’s **all** preference. The answer to all of the questions like will I be screwed in x scenario, will I be able to level okay, etc is: you’ll be fine, just play what you think is fun. 
---
The /r/classicwow experience
---
"Something something classic"
---
"Retail sucks though mimimi amirite guys?"
---
Not if you’re Faxmonkey, but without knowing what you’re doing with AOE farming, you’ll either die a lot or level slowly or both.
---
But but but... All the RNG gear, free stuff, super champion of the world #1,981,034 and all that other stuff doesn't keep you enticed?
---
To each his own. I like the beach and my hobbies
---
A single instance of organized loot trading may go unnoticed, but continual use of it will. Everything is not in some magical bubble of how terrible it will be.
---
As a player you make decisions on who to group with. If you are going to UBRS for the Dal'Rend you probably will not go in a group that has the potential of having 3 other people rolling on that loot. You'll find a group where the odds are better. If your bored, or the fact that there are 3 other people in the group who could theoretically use the item doesn't deter you, then you are aware of the fact that you might not get the item if it drops. 
---
However, I am sure you will take a note on who wins the items. And perhaps you think it is safe to group with them a second time. If they were to roll need again on the Dal'Rend, well then, that WOULD be suspicious. And you can call them out on it, and that is where community and blacklisting would help take care of the ninja looter.  
---
It will suck that people will take advantage of it, but it's not too much different then intentionally forming a group where you know you'd be the only one to get said item in the first place. The need to be "sublte" restricts it's rampant, wild accusations that everyone will be steeling your loot.   
---
Think about why you are running said dungeon. Think about the players who are in your group. Make a decision on if you think the odds are worth it. "Loot sharing" or not, you enter a group with 4 people who could theoretically use the item, then your chances are 1 in 4, whether or not the other three are working together to get a specific player the item.
---
Rogue or warlock. Mages are definitely the laziest, but they have cc duties to keep them in check.
---
My first character ever was a druid in vanilla. I can't wait to make my hybrid druid again. 
---
Fury warrior for sure (as long as they dont have to tank)
---
&gt;you have 1.5 flash heal
---
Which is extremely inefficient and will oom you pretty quickly if you use it a lot.
---
&gt;as a shaman you use three ranks of chain heal, for different situations so you dont oom
---
I only ever used rank 1 and still found myself chugging mana potions even in MC.
---
Warlocks have to CC adds a lot with banish/fear and they are at least at range so they don't get cleaved. 
---
Rogues in a landslide =P
---
I won't say if it's good or not (not my place) but they explicitly said they only have the 1.12 data. And that they'll keep the data "almost sacrosanct". It's *highly* unlikely there will be any item progression.
---
I have the cataclysm collectors edition sealed.  No idea where I got it from though.  Figure I could get about tree fiddy for it. 
---
&gt;Dire Maul (1.3) ZG (1.7) were in the game way before that, which is still very early in the game timeline. It has exactly the same effect you are talking about.
---
they don't have nearly the same scope as 1.10 did as far as making dungeon blues better than raid loot. 
---
&gt;It's wrong exactly because of what I explained in another comment. Most people were in the case you are describing. Most people actually got that catchup gear instead of the "true order" gear. Because most people either 1) began playing late in the game timeline 2) Took their time to level up, to do quests, to farm reputations, to do PvP instead of PvE. No one noticed "oh damn, that content is easier than expected..".
---
patch 1.10 is very late vanilla already, and just because many people (i doubt it's the majority as you say as post 1.10 is such a small part of vanilla) didn't experience MC/BWL until post 1.10 with their buffed dungeon blues, doesn't mean it wouldn't be damaging for classic. Are you actually saying that having 1.10 items from content patch 1.1 will not have any negative side effects? As i said, forget about MC being easier, the main thing is that you won't get any loot (almost) from raids that is better than your lvl 50-60 blues, how do you think the community will respond when they've been playing classic for over 1 year and still are running around in the same blues they got at lvl 55 more than a year before, because the raids just dont drop anything better until AQ40/naxx? There's a reason this stuff was added late in vanilla (1.10 particularily), it was a catch up patch, it was never intended to be there from the get go.
---
By your logic, why not just launch the game with all content out too? why are they doing progressive content patches? Why not launch with naxx already out? After all, most people didn't get to experience back then pure patch 1.1 with only MC/ony out... 
---
Imho for a pally to sync well with a mage I would go holy/prot 
---
- Imp blessing of freedom/blessing of protection would be handy for the messups.
---
- Blessing of Kings
---
- Consecration to help dps packs
---
And the pally could pull everything and bring it to the mage to Nova and aoe down. 
---
If she is ret then she'll slap 1 target at a time, and once you start aoe farming you won't want to go near those stacked mobs so she might feel worthless. 
---
But if you are killing mobs 1 or 2 at a time holy/ret is fine.
---
We get it, you played a pally
---
roll human :D 
---
What about hunters? Are they expected to trap in raids?
---
It looks like a five pixel animation.
---
lol, someone went through and downvoted everyone

Trap, pull, kite, tranquil. 
---
Lesser Zeal - a spell for priests that is just meh.
---
You could swap the BfA icon with the TBC icon and it'd be the same story. I started getting shit for clicking starting with the release of Arenas. It was an overall positive change for me anyway, but I was very stubborn about it until then. 
---
&gt; Turns out the guild was playing a trick on my and it was all a joke. 
---
wait, how? the entire guild was rigged, or they basically gquit and returned 15 minutes later, or what?
---
Noooo:-O
---
On the other hand, if you want to make your game world seem as fake as possible, both phasing and sharding are excellent tools.
---
Thx, great answer! I will just let it rest till classic comes
---
agree :D
---
They had it all planned out ahead of time. They all rejoined the guild and we finished ZG that night. 
---
Absolutely not below mage without front shred. Maybe level with mage but Ferals have 0 downtime by the time they get their eviscerate at 32ish. 
---
They also have 30% speed from level 21. Run speed makes a BIG difference to levelling speed.
---
They were doing small hotfixes during beta, so Blizz will probably be working on some things as we are playing and problems come to their attention. 
---
Hopefully anyway. If they just set it and forget it then we can start worrying.
---
As far as loot/DKP/attendance tracking (and even in-raid assignments), most of it these days (on vanilla servers) is done via google docs. I imagine this is how it will be on Classic as well.
---
if your only using rank 1 then you are spending more time healing and not using the 5 seconds mana regen when not casting
---
&gt; they don't have nearly the same scope as 1.10 did as far as making dungeon blues better than raid loot. 
---
Lol. That's your opinion if 20 mans and Dire Maul did not act as catchup gear and that will not replace dungeon gear. I do not share that opinion.
---
&gt;the main thing is that you won't get any loot (almost) from raids that is better than your lvl 50-60 blues, how do you think the community will respond when they've been playing classic for over 1 year and still are running around in the same blues they got at lvl 55 more than a year before, because the raids just dont drop anything better until AQ40/naxx? 
---
You are over exaggerating and you know it. You absolutely can't state that for all pieces of gear, and again Before doing ZG and AQ20, you will need gear, and that same gear will get replaced as time goes on when you farm ZG and AQ20. Same for MC and BWL. You're just lying to prove whatever points you have.
---
You know it doesn't mean shit for most people. But what do I know I've never played on private server in a guild where the only goal is endgame PvE as fast as possible.
---
when i reach the 40's for the first time on my shaman, i had left my leveling guilds to join a guild with my personal friend. he ended up buying me my first mount. while questing one day in STV, i ran into my old guild master and had to explain why i left. that was when the STV arena event happened, so we all ran down there. everyone was fighting each other and i just ended up walking straight to the chest and looting it. before you could blink, there were about 20 people (horde and alliance) chasing me through the entrance. after corpse running back, i split the good with my ex guild master and we said goodbye. not long later he joined my friends guild and we all were doing MC and ZG together.
---
+1 for google docs. Easy to share and great transparency.
---
Check out Subnautica. Great game.
---
Sounds great. Just be sure to include more regions than just eu/na. Maybe even a preferred timezone.
---
Not sure the Upvote/Down vote system is really required, as it's rather subjective pre release, and if the site is successful - open to large guilds to game the system to stay at the top. 
---
*Dps war topping meter, moving is a DPS Loss
---
why are you so hostile? i'm not lying, maybe i exaggerated slightly to prove a point. 
---
&gt;Lol. That's your opinion if 20 mans and Dire Maul did not act as catchup gear and that will not replace dungeon gear. I do not share that opinion.
---
maybe go actually read patch notes and read up on what 1.10 added as far as itemization? it's by faaar the biggest itemization patch, that buffed normal dungeon blues and added dozens new OP ones. Also you didn't answer me:
---
By your logic, why not just launch the game with all content out too? why are they doing progressive content patches? Why not launch with naxx already out? After all, most people didn't get to experience back then pure patch 1.1 with only MC/ony out...
---
Rogue is by far the slowest levelling class for skilled player. While warrior is the slowest for the avarage playerbase.
---
Mage is the fastest when you are able to aoe farm 
---
Especially with the awful original default run speed the game had.
---
Do you think Classic will actually be as social as WoW was back in the day? 
---
Rogue probably. They have a threat drop, vanish, easy rotation without any special duties. A warrior might need to tank in some situations, or if they're awake they could save the day by taunting something. Mages decurse, CC, water. Warlocks provides cookies, portals, CC elementals. Hunters remove enrage, kite, pull bosses etc. 
---
"You don't think like me?!! Then f\*\*\* you !!!"
---
This was technically early BC, but I was still leveling my first ever character and was 40-something, I think, so I'm going to count it.
---
Anyway, there was this night elf rogue on my server who was pretty well known for having a Thunderfury.  He also ganked frequently.  My roommate was leveling his priest through Hillsbrad, and sure enough, this guy shows up and starts ganking him.  So myself and another friend of ours, ~45 Rogue and ~50 Warrior, roll in to assist.  Given that the rogue was 70 at this point and in Kara gear (using his TF offhand, of course), we really didn't stand much of a chance.  He killed us all 2 or 3 times, but then we *finally* pulled off a kill on him with some lucky stuns and bleeds.  I was so happy, seeing his dead body there in his stupid T4 and Thunderfury, I took a screenshot of it.
---
Good god yes 
---
Thanks for the feedback,  true gonna need a timezone filter or horary with most activity between the guild
---
Pre servers release is gonna be without the ranking
---
You should stick to retail if you want aoe loot. 
---
Shaman doesn't have much spirit on its gear. "5 second regen" is only for Priest and Druid who DO have more spirit on their gear.
---
0-10 druid sucks, gets powerspike with bear for a few levels, gets powerspike at 20 compared to mage consitancy. Once u get blizzard they can 1v20 mobs if they want on top of free water/evocate and blink mobility... druid bleeds and ferocious bite is seriously ass and you cant quickly kill orange mobs nor deal with 1v2/3  efficiently until u get innervate. Shred is basically what makes feral lvling good
---
It's more than that in the private servers so maybe better? 
---
This unfortunately you don't know until you give players the chance.
---
Believe me, that image you have of people in Vanilla was also because of the rules that took place. With loot trading you can gain way more money, and you can give it to a friend of your group. If you give more reasons to players to abuse the systems, more of them will abuse it. Evil or not.
---
&gt; yes no one disturbed the Event, that's how diciplined RP Servers were back in 2005
---
today, trying to join in-character an RP event, I see people talk to each other, I try to normally, in-character, join in, but zero reaction - as if I weren't there. I do some poking emotes, no reaction. I even do in-character backstab emote - no reason, he still lives and is fine and continues the topic he was discussing. 
---
Then, I get out of the bushes, completely naked, start a /dance, and get a /w "mind you not disturb RP?"
---
well, unlike his actions, my naked dance was fully in-character - since he didn't even notice my dagger in his back, I found out that it was just an illusion, and started to dance in the middle, proving that everyone is just an illusion and I can freely pass through their bodies and nothing happens.
---
that's it. Today, people, instead of treating RP server as RP server, they treat it as a GameSpy lobby for their Discord RP servers. Everything RP in game is setup on their discord, and if you aren't on it, you are disturbing.
---
So.... I put everyone on /ignore, and started spamming toys. They already proved enough that they were not in-character.
---
My favorite is to run in and drop a howl of terror for my mage friend.  Oops.. just trying to help sorry buddy.. (but really you're annoying me by taking all the mobs).
---
I used to main a rogue in vanilla. As far as my raiding went I pretty much only got into BWL but Dropped out of raiding before they downed neff and I was pretty much always swords even for PvP. I loved it. Leveling was easy and pvp was a blast with some friends. Yeah your not gonna win all your fights but you have so many chances to just escape the ones your losing. 
---
Really looking forward to trying out the lock though in the new release. 
---
In times like this where they have to build a game that they might not remember that well, outsourcing to more experienced players more familiar with Classic WoW would be a very smart thing for them to do. 
---
Sadly the guy posting that doesn't know what phasing actually is.
---
Four moonkin fighting in PvP? That's a lot of moonfire.
---
I actually want to have some idea what class I am playing so I’ve been playing private servers specifically focusing on class mechanics, best leveling routes and just to get an idea what I will be doing for classic. 
---
Probably pretty realistic.  It comes out in the summer while I’m still in college so I’m gonna play the shit out of it and I never played vanilla.
---
&gt; It's actually fun for people to have stronger characters.
---
AND... the stronger I am the better off the 39 others are. I work my ass off to be the best so I can be the best teammate I can be.
---
Aside from min-max progression we can approach it from the magical experience angle.
---
Assumptions to make the most blizzlike oldschool experience.
---
- no one in your guild/raid has EVER done the raids.
---
- you're all normal intelligent players who will figure out the mechanics eventually.
---
After you actually die a bunch and figure out the mechanics, you'll execute like someone who has watched a video (or some other strat your guild has worked up that works for you since not all bosses have one strat). End of the day, you kill the boss, optimally or not, and move on.
---
There is a magic in building your own strategies and learning the fights on your own. But it is VERY costly. Not only in repair bills, consumables etc. But mentally/emotionally. Wipes take time in vanilla and are stressful. Our guild currently raids for 2 1/2 hours on raid nights. And a wipe, WITH soulstone/ankh etc can take 5-10min to get another attempt on the boss. If you actively choose not to learn the fights with a guide, you are basically saying, we will only get a couple of bosses per night at best in progression. You artificially slow down your progress to enjoy the process of learning the fight organically. The cost is also tangible, repair bills in classic are stiff. Plate wearers pay more than clothies, and it can be 2-5g per death. if you wipe 10 times on raid night 2x a week that's 100g a week to raid in repair bills. And if you're getting gear slower because of the organic approach, you're not farming faster because your power level increases slower.
---
Also, all of the guild need to be into the strategy of blindly learning the fights. If even a couple people did their homework or even just looked up the fights, they will just sit frustrated that people mess up mechanics, now having to pay more in repair bills and wasted consumables because of the other raiders and they will become bitter. 
---
Is it possible to do? Sure. But the reality is that even knowing the fights doesn't mean it is now easy. This is something that this subreddit / p server community circle jerks about a lot. I can watch every boss guide out there, but unless all of the members (or most) execute their part correctly, no one gets any progress. 
---
So by knowing the fights, you arguably increase your fun by the following:
---
1. Now you just need to perform, and do what the fight requires. Execution on some bosses is not so easy. Even when you just need to 'tank him over there' and gg. Healer's messing up, tanks not taunting, fears, the list goes on. Just because you know the fight does not mean it will be a cake walk.
---
2. Progress to more content. Killing the boss gives you loot and satisfaction, but it also lets you see more content. Doing all or most of MC in a night is a fun experience, and when it is progression will still be challenging across the board, which is the fun of it. Imagine only doing lucifron and magmadar for 3 weeks because you had to learn the fights. few upgrades, lots of deaths, and everyone else (not top tier but average raiders like you who watched the guides) have gone farther, gotten more gear, and are fighting more bosses doing more cool stuff.
---
I know its a wall of text, but let me tell you that knowing the fights is not the end of the world. And if youre smart and figure out the fights, then after that nothing is different. You'll just bang your head against a wall for a LOT longer than everyone else.
---
This isnt a platformer or shooter where retrying a boss is quick and easy. Dying is a pain in the ass, especially in vanilla. And trust me, watch all the guides you want, you. will. die.
---
Lovely, you in EU?
---
I've leveled 2 druid to max on private servers and you can look at any list of best classic levelers and druid will be #3 on most of them.
---
What is clicking in WoW?
---
Honestly, 
---
I wouldn't sweat it. In essence classic isn't about min max knowing everything. The crowd that have kept up on everything will do their own thing regardless. There will be copious amounts of players in your exact position. Classic is the journey and the community and coming together to overcome challenges. And any help you need you can find from that community or the 8000 youtube vids on how to optimize every aspect of the game. Just try it out. We know whats coming and you will be able to plan accordingly if you find like minded people that want the same thing. 
---
Nah.
---
Also good luck
---
Activating your abilities by moving your cursor over them and clicking them, instead of using the keyboard hot-keys. 
---
My guess is that it will "feel" similar early on.  But the further along you go the more you will find differences.  An example being raid numbers.  Blizzard has 1.12 numbers, but they still need to translate it into Retail.  What it ultimately comes up with - who knows.
---
They've mentioned many times that Vanilla puzzle pieces need to be fit into Retail pieces, and sometimes the fit is very imperfect - numbers being one of them.
---
People thought Vanilla WoW leveling was tedious? Most probably never played any other MMO then before it.
---
If youi want to be a "Financial Powerhouse" roll whatever you want to actually play and then just play the auctionhouse.
---
I have a mini diablo.
---
That being said.  Classic should be Classic.  Vanilla should stay Vanilla.
---
rogues have the suppression room and stunning adds in  certain encounters
---
Ive levelled druid to 60 on feenix, nost, k2, lh, nd. All servers u can frontstab as well as half of them with bugged shit like benefiting a bunch from grinding stones. Yea, they are pretty strong even without it, but its bigger than u think. Mage is just better imo
---
fair enough
---
And ammo
---
A warlock's responsibility is to summon my lazy ass to the raid.
---
Yes, if you compare a rogue to a warlock, they are pretty bad levelers. Rogues have frequent downtime and problems fighting multiple adds, warlocks have zero downtime and can fight 4+ without breaking a sweat. Rogues can PvP decently well in 1v1, warlocks can take 2v1s if they have any slight level/gear advantage. However, if you didn't like hunters because the playstyle is boring, leveling warlocks are IMO a little better but pretty much DoT/DoT/DoT/wand till nearly dead/Soul Drain. Tbf rogues are SS/SS/SS/SS/Eviscerate, so again not much going on there either, at least till end game.
---
&gt; why are you so hostile? 
---
Not sure where I was hostile. I simply highlight that you are obviously extrapolating way too much to prove something isn't true. And I talk about private servers elite players because I firmly think that they are the only one that are being vocal about this. And since we are in a subreddit, it's normal that you hear them. But it doesn't mean they are the majority (far from it).
---
&gt;maybe go actually read patch notes and read up on what 1.10 added as far as itemization? it's by faaar the biggest itemization patch, that buffed normal dungeon blues and added dozens new OP ones.
---
I will not believe this makes 20 mans gear obsolete. Sorry. It's your opinion it has bigger consequences.
---
&gt;Also you didn't answer me:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;By your logic, why not just launch the game with all content out too? why are they doing progressive content patches? Why not launch with naxx already out? After all, most people didn't get to experience back then pure patch 1.1 with only MC/ony out...
---
This is an extrapolation, a fallacy that you only use to further try to disprove my point, although what you are describing and what I am talking about are far from the same.
---
And you know what? For the average player, who cares when Naxx is released? They won't touch it at least for or year, arguably more. If you take into account all the details we talked about, and if you stop exaggerating, you'll understand that as long as you are an average player, you will get pieces of gear from everywhere, at your pace, up to whatever goal you've fixed yourself.
---
No normal player guild is gonna do MC in full green 0 blue. No normal player is gonna do BWL on full blue. No normal guild is gonna do AQ40 in sub ZG/MC gear (with little pieces exceptions here and there), and that applies all the time. No one will have the same gear when beginning AQ40 that they had when they began MC.
---
And it's even more true since not all guilds will have 100% optimised raids with pure DPS spec, consumes, perfectly skilled healer and tanks. Again, we are talking about normal players here, not hardcore trained 10+ years pservers players.
---
My vanilla mindset at the time was: plate belongs to me, get blues, go into bg any time it pops, kill the other faction on sight, get into raids, and get the purple's that are upgrades. And "ZOMG gimme that tier piece" and "I want Thunder fury so bad!" 
---
Oh and beat my irl friends in duels. 
---
I was a Tauren warrior who wanted to main tank, but was out geared in my guild so most of the time I dps'd with a 2h, and everyone thought that was normal.
---
This got me through MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20, and rank 11 before a girl came into my life and didn't let me play as much. Whaaaaat. 
---
Never got Thunderfury...
---
there were so many, not bragging, I remember the relief after killing 4 horsemen. 
---
Too worried about being number one instead of just enjoying the game for what it is. People like you are the ones who are abusing game mechanics to push timers, kill bosses, and get freebie gear. Min maxers are the death of gaming. 
---
Pretty much same boat. Reached level 112 and wasn't enjoying myself at all, even coming off a year break I couldn't find that spark.

Pally and Priest never die, they kill slowly but very efficient as well. Rogue has to eat for health. Also pally has 8% runspeed.

Both are faster than rogue

Why not both WoW and programming? The various pserver projects (desperately) need eyeballs—the more people who can test, ferret out problems, and make fixes, the better! Plus you’ll learn how a real software project is organized and work with real code in the wild.
---
This is so true. The excitement that you feel as a teenager/young adult just can't be matched now. I used to dream of gaming back in the day. All school day thinking of the glorious raids that awaited me or the noobs I was gonna stomp.
---
Well, we're all on reddit waiting for this damn game. Maybe we can get back a small sliver of that right?
---
I mean at the very least any class can take herb/alch so they can all make money.  
---
I guess that when someone says:
---
 "I found several niche areas where I could leverage the strengths of my class (hard to dismount, stuns and fears) into profitable solo farming on par with DM farm runs. "  
---
   
---
You don't expect the "niche area that leverages the strengths of a prot warrior" to be "Common mining locations".  
---
But yes I largely agree that any class can find ways to make money and mining isn't as bad as people think it is.
---
Meh.  Some people will be more casual, some will want to race.  Although the grind that made Vanilla won't be there in Classic.  Not unless they do a re-tune.  
---
It'll be its own game.
---
I probably wont' decide if i'm going to play until 2 months in - when i get a better feel for how Vanilla Classic actually will be.
---
Clicking isn't a Classic vs. BFA thing, it's a 2004 vs 2019 thing. People know better than they did 15 years ago.
---
&gt; Suddenly my loading screen shows what is happening, that I am going allllll the way from northwest Kalimdor to the Eastern Kingdoms, and I set foot in Menethil Harbor in the Wetlands
---
wait, wasn't that map-like loading screen introduced in later TBC/WotLK patch?
---
&gt; My computer starts to slow down and get choppy, as if it is having a heart attack. We go through the entrance where a bunch of people are attacking each other and there's flags everywhere
---
aah right, duels. Another forgotten activity. Why isn't it happening anymore? Or, maybe it is, but in the deepest of shards?
---
&gt; my friend veers off and we start traveling along the mountain ridge west and go to the barracks. Cool! Once again, I've seen these before in the WarCraft games!
---
at elast you recognized barracks. Myself, I recognized them only when flying above - same for zikkurats. Guess they look the same from the same perspective...
---
Night elf "buildings" were quite easy to recognize even from the ground level. Never recognized orc buildings, though.
---
&gt; where is the Defias Messenger?
---
in Mankrik's bed
---
&gt; My friend takes me to the inn, tells me to set my Hearthstone here
---
I always hated the idea. I used to hearth after hunting, not before, and wanted to be close to the bank and ah.
---
&gt; alright, off you go, enjoy!
---
damn, when thinking of that, I think I'll be nolifing even more than back then, to bring back all that memories, from both night elf and human starting zones.
---
&gt; This was January 2006, one week after receiving World of WarCraft for Christmas. It is the most vivid WoW memory I have from then
---
again, my memories from the "friend's" point of view.
---
I started a low-level "low-meaning" human warlock. And kept seeing people being "better". They were basically more "full of everything". They had more varying items, with shoulderpads, helmets, cloaks, sticking out things, tier sets, etc. They had mounts. Basically everything looked "more expensive/rich".
---
But, I wanted to be like them. I was leveling. I got to level 40, and got my class quest for a mount "oh, finally, I'll be like others" - no! My mount, was just a stupid horse! Nothing special, others' mounts looked better!"
---
Then, I got to level 60, got some decent items, a dreadsteed, and quite forgot about the way I used to look at "rich" people. Then, one day, I remember i was in Darnassus, preparing to turn in big stacks of Morrowgrain. And, I was sitting right next to the bank - on a Dreadsteed, with a full green/blue gear and a few epic pieces. Everything was empty - but, I saw one elf, in a pyjamas-looking gear, running around - he stopped by me and said "hi".
---
I knew then. "Now, it's me who's rich".
---
Oh sweet , good bot
---
The rogue is a solid leveler, but the Warlock is just superior in every way during that phase of the game. A petclass with infinite sustain in both Mana and HP, the ability to take on multiple enemies at once, not reliant on any cooldowns, built in healthpots, built in self-rezz, and gets a (almost) free mount at 40.
---
Endgame, well, it's complicated.
---
It goes without saying that both are competitive for top spots in damage. Both are great fun in PvP as well.
---
The thing is, Warlocks are an extremely underplayed class in vanilla (there will be an initial rush, and then most will reroll around lvl 20 to go rogue, mage or hunter), and VERY useful to a group (healthstones, soulstones, summons, banish, fear). They will gear up very fast, as there is simply not that much competition for the stuff they need, and it's easier to find a raidspot, or being brought along for, say, UBRS or DM runs.
---
On the other hand, rogues, historically, are the single most overplayed class in Vanilla WoW, even topping hunters. Oh you want a raidspot? Sorry, we already got 6 rogues, and 3 more on the bench. Gearing is slow, and on everything but leather armor, you have hunters (the second most played class) competing against you.
---
I played a rogue all the way from the end of WotLK to BfA. But in Vanilla and BC, I was a Warlock...and I know I will be again =)
---
I'd rather they create new Vanilla content compared to re-create future xpacs.  Future xpacs ruined previous content and made them useless.
---
&gt; he was quitting the game, then logged off. Like 1 month after vanilla release
---
I think I understand the reason... XÐ
---
&gt; in early TBC, i recieved a mail. It contained 50,000 gold and just said "From: Unknown"
---
wait... was it 10 times more than for the 280% flying?
---
damn, never got my 280% until late WotLK
---
&gt; on the road in dusk wood, look back, see a big undead running towards me and die
---
kept happening
---
&gt;And I talk about private servers elite players because I firmly think that they are the only one that are being vocal about this.
---
You are probably right, but that doesn't invalidate the concerns, I'm a private server player (or used to be, not anymore) but i'm not some hardcore player as you insinuated that only cares about clearing raids fast. I'm a straight up casual. We hear from the private servers players because they are the only ones speaking pretty much (as you said). 
---
&gt;And you know what? For the average player, who cares when Naxx is released? They won't touch it at least for or year, arguably more.
---
Yeah, same as with the itemization issues right? But blizzard still decided it was worth alotting development resources to implement progressive content patches, even tho it only affects the "hardcore" as you say. And ill say that it's in no way confirmed blizz won't do progressive itemization. Ion answered about it that they are still thinking about stuff like this, and from ama other day it was even confirmed he had an email correspondence with Nano from the nostalrius project regarding this issue, as nano believed it to be important. 
---
&gt;I will not believe this makes 20 mans gear obsolete. Sorry. It's your opinion it has bigger consequences.
---
I never said it would make 20 man gear obsolete, now it's you who are strawmanning. I said "mostly", and admitted in my previous post that i exaggerated slightly to prove my point. Post 1.10 though, there will be very, VERY little gear from 20 mans that is bis. especially from zg there will be hardly anything at all better than 1.10 dungeon blues. AQ20 yeah there will be more, but at that point we're already at patch 1.9, more than 1 year into vanilla. 
---
&gt;No one will have the same gear when beginning AQ40 that they had when they began MC.
---
not the exact same gear no, but if it's post 1.10, they will still probably use 70-80% of the same blues. 
---
I'm NZ based and planning on playing alliance on a pve server on a casual basis. It would be great to find a nz based guild that does content during nz times. Sadly long gone are the days of being able to play wow to my hearts content due to adult responsibilities :'(
---
Ok I saw it was stunned when the clip transitioned but I didn't understand how a rocket helm would fit in there - does that mean if you RH the rat from the flagroom your guy auto runs all the way down the hall and up the ramp to the rat? Or does he climb up the vertical wall to the roof?
---
He edited out the important part lol
---
The 
---
Thank you, helpful comment.  Good perspective.  In that case I would definitely choose Rogue.
---
I used to think it was unfair that mages got free water until I realised you could level another toon in the time you spend drinking 
---
Thanks man!  I think I will be going Rogue based on the comments so far.  Is there going to be a lot of competition to get into raids and instances as a Rogue do you think?
---
Thank you.  Warlocks do not feel like my playstyle the more I get into them, even if they do a lil better 1v2 and can take on 4+ mobs at a time.
---
Good stuff
---
Something like that would be perfect. An optional, client-side checkbox that allowed you to flick between the models (providing the hitboxes are the same).
---
Hunter.  Automatically gets +99 on /roll for blame.
---
Sponsored by the Backpedaling Gang
---
See the utility of the Warlock for grouping really has me wanting to play one...I just know I will be valuable for content, less competition etc.  Dangit ok, so I think I would enjoy Rogue playstyle more but if I choose it I will have to deal with some downsides whereas if I choose Warlock I won't enjoy the playstyle as much but I will have plenty of space to fit in....hmm..

Yeah same. Leveled a druid to 60 last year and can confirm. You can go fairly quick and you can even solo elites later on.

I raided hardcore from late Vanilla to Ulduar hardmodes as a Resto Shaman. I raided hardcore as a Hunter during Cataclysm for a bit too. This time around I think I'm going to play a Tauren Hunter or Undead Mage. I'm not looking to raid hardcore, but I would like to raid eventually with a groups of mature, like-minded people. 
---
I work shift work, so there will be some nights I just can't commit to raiding and they will change every week, so I'm looking for a flexible group that would be okay with that. I'm not looking for a free spot in a raid whenever it is convenient to me, but I'd like the opportunity to prove myself to not be a liability in a raid and run dungeons and quests with guildies.
---
Planning on doing Princess runs and Tribute runs when not grinding dungeons/quests with guildies.
---
PvE/PvP Horde NA. EST.

I do like the idea for a time zone selection. All of my friends and myself that will be playing are not the young kids we use to be. We don’t have the free time like the good ol days. We all work the standard 8-5 with a handful taking care of kids. There’s quit a few of us that  will play again so we are debating on finding a guild or starting our own. If we start our own we will try and find people that have similar lives were we can still play together and enjoy the game again.
---
I do like the new models for the player races. I used to think classic races were underwhelming, even as early as BC, thanks to the constantly evolving engine. I really liked the dynamic shadow system which was first introduced after Sunwell. And the upgraded water around Cata was really nice. These are my opinions though and there is a certain charm to classic wow that I will appreciate
---
Unless you are all 100% speculating, I fear you may all be setting yourselves up for massive disappointment.
---
I don't think Blizzard will ever expand on Classic.  As much as I'd love to see them re-release TBC/WotLK, they're gonna suck up some extra money from Private Server players and then never touch back on it.
---
Blizzard isn't what it used to be.  My expectations for Classic are extremely low, and I think that will stop me from being disappointed.
---
What gets me is how readily available and easy to get all this info is. People get all butthurt at min/maxing here, but it doesn't take some no life to do it.
---
Quick Google search and I have an amazing comprehensive hunter guide. Fd/trap macro, optimal rotation, pet suggestions, etc. I already played to max level, so wtf mystery am I even spoiling for myself?
---
Nah, states
---
Druid does have to drink but not as much as you'd think because of innervate. I've not played my druid for about a year, but I remember when leveling I could probably kill 4-5 mobs in a row, healing between when necessary, pop innervate, throw on some hots, shapeshift, and go, and I could get another 3-4 mobs before ever having to actually drink.
---
What about keyboard turning or backpedaling? 
---
As a hybrid clicker that's who I rag on.
---
Good luck! There is definitely space

out there for making a site like that.

Unexpected:  I remember as a feral druid landing in the Wetlands and seeing the boat to Theramore was arriving, so I landed and went straight to travel form!  I got a boat to catch, after all!
---
I realized halfway down the dock that I was missing some health.
---
A rogue tried to gank me at the flight master when I landed and I didn't even notice it.  I circled back and bled him when he got close to the flight master again and tossed a faerie fire on him.  I caught the next boat.
---
Memorable: When my guild master at the time was drunk and got confused between a bear that had dismounted him and a small group of Horde that were passing by.  He started going after the Horde and we had to yell at him in Vent to stop and explain that the Horde didn't do anything.  Their group had stopped and stared at us while our GM was in aggressive stance, while we /sighed at him.  Someone else in our group took a drink to get the 'is tipsy' message and /apologized to the Horde.  They laughed and rode on.
---
Magical: Exploring Hyjal.  I don't really remember how long I spent there, looking at... everything.  I sat in front of the tree for a long time.
---
I think their point is that once a ninja looter is kicked after the first boss more than twice, he'll stop ninja looting.  No one expects there to be a server-wide, constantly-maintained blacklist.  
---
The griefers will learn their lesson when they need on an item they don't use and then get kicked.
---
Yeah, something I wish could have existed was the agility priest that increases ranged damage. But alas, it does not work. That'd be amazing if an agility priest with a good wand and a quiver could do okay damage. Could use SWP too and not worry about going oom.

Just googled this image here [https://i.stack.imgur.com/qL2iF.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qL2iF.png). If you look at the ring on the right there is a right blue text there that says exactly what it is, except the countdown starts with 2 hours.

They've already stated that CE rewards were given out, are currently in retail, and will remain in retail only. Sorry to be the one to break the news.

You mean low margin of failure. A high margin of error is high risk of failure.

Roll combat rogue. You'll have a blast.

This would impact leveling greatly and should not be added
---
Yeah i think epic flying was like 5 or 6k gold? it was an insane amount anyway
---
&gt; I never said it would make 20 man gear obsolete, now it's you who are strawmanning. I said "mostly", and admitted in my previous post that i exaggerated slightly to prove my point. **Post 1.10 though, there will be very, VERY little gear from 20 mans that is bis. especially from zg there will be hardly anything at all better than 1.10 dungeon blues.** AQ20 yeah there will be more, but at that point we're already at patch 1.9, more than 1 year into vanilla.  
---
&gt;" No one will have the same gear when beginning AQ40 that they had when they began MC. "  
---
&gt;not the exact same gear no, but if it's post 1.10, they will still probably use 70-80% of the same blues.
---
Then we simply disagree (specially what I put in bold from you). I would be very surprised if it was true. **And don't forget that Classic is not about "BiS or nothing". There is an in-between.** Again my opinion, but I firmly believe no normal player will be full BiS / pre-BiS neither when beginning MC, neither before doing AQ40, simply because getting gear takes so long, and most people won't be 100% hardcore to the point they will hardly try to get the BiS if they have "only" almost BiS. Right?
---
&gt;Yeah, same as with the itemization issues right? But blizzard still decided it was worth alotting development resources to implement progressive content patches, even tho it only affects the "hardcore" as you say. And ill say that it's in no way confirmed blizz won't do progressive itemization. Ion answered about it that they are still thinking about stuff like this, and from ama other day it was even confirmed he had an email correspondence with Nano from the nostalrius project regarding this issue, as nano believed it to be important. 
---
I think we agree. And to be clear I am not against itemization. I'm against doing such a hassle about it because it has close to no consequences for the hyper majority of players which are gonna be casual / not PvE endgame oriented / leveling oriented / farming/rep/etc oriented, that are gonna do endgame content way after phase 2 or even phase 3, plus the fact that getting gear is not instant, plus everything else I said about the skill of players.
---
Don't blame Blizzard as it was the plague if they don't add itemization. Loot trading and figure out what they are going to do with sharding / servers is way more important.
---
As I've read: Cat gets tons of damage (Shaman problem). You do kill faster but it also means you need to heal yourself more. Add to this itemization limits (you need both mana and damage). Innervate at level 40. There will be down times anyway.  
---
But my friend said it's still convenient to level a druid. I do also see that Druids might up to 3rd fastest levelers; on tie with a Priest and AoE farming Mage (not sure how they do that but they do).
---
People can play however they want, but I do think it is funny how offended some people get by those who want to know what they are doing. Look at that guy over there with his fd/trap macro, better gear, and optimal dps rotation doing 3 times my dps. Why can't he play the game exactly like I do and stop being such a piece of shit!
---
What does 'eligible to loot this time' mean?
---
Achievements are a positive. For those that don’t care they can just ignore them. For those that do care it keep them actively playing, which is good for everyone else.
---
If blizzard doesn’t add it someone will create it.
---
Rogue was one of the most played classes honestly. But if your diligent and have the required gear you shouldn’t have a problem finding a spot in a raid. Getting gear was tough just because of how many rogues were in PuG runs of things like UBRS but still I enjoyed it. 
---
Ok, so will you be moving to EU or change your IP so you can play on EU servers? Daddy really wants to play with Thomas
---
You should not be able to see players at BS from LM
---
Ah, you get the idea!
---
I don't get this at all :(
---
It's not that much harder tbh. I've done both. 
---
Mage can be very, very repetitive. Frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, Frost Nova when they get close, run backwards, more frostbolts, and maybe use cone of cold if you haven't killed the mob yet for last second damage. You can do this twice (depending on level and mana pool) before needing to drink. It's just dull.
---
A mage can aoe grind, though. But people act as if this is a thing you can do anywhere and anytime. There are only a dozen areas in the game where it works due to mob spacing and them not being casters. You need to be pretty polished at your technique with it, and you can die pretty easily if you mess up or RNG fucks you over with resists. And if it's mobs that other people want or need for a quest, good luck.
---
It was done in the past. Pickpocketing mobs along the way. SM was pretty popular for a while before they nerfed vendor prices. But you can still make an easy penny.
---
Their testers were surprised. The people who implemented it .. obviously weren't.
---
I think they're only common now and maybe at the end of vanilla. For a long time mining among the elites in winterspring wasn't very common. I know my route in searing gorge very rarely had anyone else doing it. I think perhaps this time around that will be different and I'm sure its different on Pservers, I was merely commenting on my experience from back in live vanilla. Sorry if it came off as bait and switch for some great new insight.
---
You'll have time for alts? Jealous. 
---
Lol. Every time I die to stuff like this I feel so bad
---
lmao 
---
I didn't even know what clicking was until TBC and I played vanilla for a good while.
---
People who were also in the group and present during the kill. Basically anyone that 'could' have looted the item. 
---
Those who would have gotten a change to roll on the item, or those who had the change to be given it by master looter, etc. It basically gives you to option to give it to another player who could have gotten it by the normal loot rules.
---
Rogues have a few farm spots, and do really well with druids if you have a buddy to farm with since they can sneak and heal. But they aren't great at soloing bosses since they can't spam backstab, can't kite, and aren't super tanky. The most profitable runs are usually pickpocket runs, at least from what I've heard, I've never tried to farm on a rogue.
---
Warlocks can mara and DME farm fairly well, and IMO are preferable farmers to rogues.
---
That was in retail though. It's been verified in a joanna video.
---
Yeah people have forgotten that while vanilla is this hard-ass type of person's MMO compared to current retail, Vanilla, back in the day, was the carebear game. 
---
What?! No enormous death penalties? You can keep your items when you die? And you don't lose exp or levels when you die? What a carebear game! Quests are for wusses!

I don't mind much about the graphics, but the character animations I'm very attached to. When I use will of the forsaken I expect a certain animation to happen. Mostly why I don't like the look of retail wow is because the thematic design was lost along the way. Half of the people are flying around with ridiculously large dragons and other half is flying with golden robots. How I see Warcraft thematically is much closer to WC3.
---
Thanks /u/Kontaz and /u/Karmond for the answers. 
---
Why is this considered to be bad for Classic WoW? (aside from the crowd that are principally opposed to all changes whatsoever)
---
I can see how this can be exploited, but the exploitation doesn't seem to be any different from people pressing 'Need' when they don't need something or a Master Looter being corrupt and giving an item to his friends.
---
What unique issues does 'Loot Trading' bring to the table that makes it a bad choice for Classic WoW?
---
Yeah, let's not forget about the big wow forum heist of 2005, where copyrighted strategies were stolen from major guilds... "stolen", rofl
---
I'm not but I used to listen to old WoW podcasts from 2005 so I'm pretty well acquainted with the kind of world in which WoW was operating. Loads of people held off on playing it b/c it was seen as too casual. 
---
I was thinking the exact same thing and thinking I was taking crazy pills. I had to scroll too far down for someones correct explanation. But I was happy to see the amount of upvotes on it.
---
Sharding vs Phasing. (OP actually meant sharding) 
---
Yep this is correct answer. Everyone else gets different jobs all the time in raids. I can’t think of one example of a fight where a dps warrior does anything special.
---
you can allways try to age restict the guild :P No one over the age of 25 :P
---
Someone will re-make all the big ones. Whether it's decursive by name or not is irrelevant. The purpose it served will create a void that needs to be filled one way or another.
---
dont be dumb and grab every quest possible?
---
Yea, you're going to get that desire and itch to play, a lot. You just have to do something else with that time. The more you are bored the more you will want to go back. I just replace one MMO with another and play FFXIV instead until classic.

And yet I'm getting shit on and downvoted by the community for saying I want to keep this stuff fresh. I just think it's crazy anyone would ever look at guides for classic bosses(10 months ahead of time) if they never even step foot in the raids. Maybe the night of the raid or if you wipe a couple times. Sorry I even chimed in, these people are ridic
---
no thanks...effects pvp
---
Meh, not really. ZG was intended, by the words of the devs, as a bridge between UBRS and MC. They just happened to get thing very wrong when ZG is actually harder than MC and is, for the most part, not the better gear.
---
Additionally, I'll argue against that neither are catchup mechanics. The way catchup mechanics are used was to allow you to either breeze through or entirely skip old content and jump into the latest tier due to stronger gear being thrown at you in 5 mans. Having t0.5 didn't let you do that, and neither did ZG gear. It was sidegrades from MC, with a few pieces being better. But it would be foolish to believe that you could skip MC. More to the point, even if it did allow people to skip MC, great, you're in BWL and you're undergeared and you still are 2 entire 40 man raids behind in progression from the most recent Naxx tier. Not much of a catch-up, is it?
---
It somewhat undermines existing systems and habbits. If you were back in 2006 you may have raided in a guild with a DKP system where for your efforts you were awarded points which you used for items. Well now if we try to do that with this new loot trading there is a next step of corruption where you buy the item with these points you have but you give it to someone else. It brings some good things and some bad things, but is mostly despised by people because its to relieve some effort from game masters part, which people are entitled to. One good argument that I'v seen is now they will receive tickets about it, but just the other way and the ticket amounts will be similar. My personal opinion on the subject is that just leave it out and have people live with their mistakes.
---
I always valuate based on the cost of a movie ticket so anything up to like 20 accounts is fine as long as I play at least 15 hours per month :D
---
Financially sound? No, not at all. But it's easy metric by which to gauge the relative merit of various forms of entertainment.
---
...but how do Warlocks have a higher risk of failure?
---
A lot of us know the boss strats from killing the boss 14 years ago or recently on lights hope/ pservers 
---
I said you know what I mean.
---
That means what I said may not be the right phrasing, but you get the point.
---
Wowprogress is already done bro. Its about hardcore, but everyone can find guild for him.
---
Retail now, but i think they will support classic.
---
Nickel slots player looking down on the Penny slots player. 
---
Right on, makes sense. 
---
I have a feeling that any big vanilla servers that are still active after Classic is released will be taken down by Blizzard so theoretically we might be able to openly talk about them all.
---
Don’t project your insecurities on other people. It’s never been a goal to be number one or better than other people; it’s a goal to be better than myself yesterday. 
---
Abuse game mechanics to push timers for boss kills and freebie gear? My entire pre classic effort is practicing 1-10 and 10-20 Horde Hunter routes to attempt to get ahead of the pack and researching 30-40 beast farming spots and their efficiency for keeping a good exp/hour and managing some gold/hour for Mount. I don’t care about gear, it’s a deterrent for leveling quickly.
---
I SAID G’DAY SIR.
---
part of the point is that finding players shouldnt be fast and easy. this encourages u 2 make friends . ppl to count on.
---
Can't say it rings a bell. Would help to have something above 15p resolution.
---
Old system - a Ninja looter gets an item they can't use. Sells to vendor for some gold.
---
New system - a Ninja looter can give the item to a friend or guildmate who needed the item, essentially giving that person more than one roll for the item. Or they can offer to sell the loot to another player that lost the roll.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month
---
In many projects adding more people to the team does not result in accomplishing milestones faster. You end up spending more time dividing work, communicating, and fixing bugs because nobody has complete knowledge of the program. 
---
For example. A task that might take a single programmer 12 months might take two programmers 8 months. But bump that team size up to four and suddenly it still takes 8 months. Increase it to eight programmers and you start regressing, making it take 9-10 months.
---
Wand attacks don’t count as projectiles afaik, so that wouldn’t work.

**The Mythical Man-Month**
---
The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975, with subsequent editions in 1982 and 1995. Its central theme is that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later". This idea is known as Brooks' law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.
---
Brooks' observations are based on his experiences at IBM while managing the development of OS/360.

But some of those fury warriors will have to off take something eventually.
---
Warriors have very little self healing, are very dependent on gear, have little to no CC. Warriors are generally considered the slowest to level and toughest. Warriors are often limited to 1 mob at a time at their level and must eat every pull or two. 
---
Those quests where you have to get something in the back of a cave? I wasn't above running into the cave, dying. Rezzing near what i needed and then dying again and rezzing at the spirit healer. 
---
Its a hard knock life. Its not that bad and its rewarding but I recall hitting a few dead points where I could literally not manage to do any of the quests I had where as on a mage I leveled was nearly always clear sailing with very little that wasn't soloable. I dont think I manged to do the warrior lvl 30 quest until post lvl 40.
---
Ill say not that hard, most people are coming with positivity.
---
These are interesting point but are highly nuanced. It is strange for people to want to make GMs work harder. As for corruption, it has always been possible to ninja items with Group Loot or as a corrupt Master Looter, but in my experience that was offset by the community's tendency to bring such acts to light. 
---
For example, people would keep black lists and various ninja looters would be announced on world chat to be put in such lists. The ninja looters' guild masters would also be notified, or if a whole guild is compliant in corruption, it would be ostracized. 
---
All in all, I experienced relatively little ninja looting and corruption because of how tight the community on a server would be, and how quickly the news of such acts would spread. People propagating such acts would soon be barred from most if not all raids.
---
**Wouldn't the same thing prevent similar corruption as a result of loot trading?** 
---
Leveling in Teldrassil for the first time playing was quite an experience, then leaving there and realizing how vast and dangerous the rest of the world was, I will never forget it. I also remember being in Astranar, and seeing that red name text of an approaching horde for the first time. I was like holy shit and quickly ran back into town. It was just the whole experience that no other game could replicate.
---
I understand why some people like to play this way, I did quite well as a clicker in Classic/TBC.
---
I also just want people to have fun and if navigating a ton of hotkeys isn't fun for you, then I respect that.
---
I personally can handle just over 20 hotkeys any more and I'm overwhelmed.
---
I wouldn't say 7k is "Healthy" Thats like double the maximum of a Vanilla realm labeled "Full" in actual Vanilla. I kind of don't get why ppl will fear for the server pops, in Vanilla we had all kind of pops, from low to full and it was basicly fine, and everyone could find a server size they liked to play on that actually within the Vanilla design. 
---
Vanilla was never designed for the huge pops you see on pservers and you see the problems every time. Economies are totally screwed, farmspots are overfarmed, zones are way to busy for the population they are designed for creating all kinds of issues.  
---
how long has each private server lasted? 6-7 months before being abandoned? having a single server be going for multiple years without any changes is ridiculous and we all know that. when and how changes should eventually be brought in to make classic last longer then 1-2 years is a far more interesting discussion to have than bitching at people about how any change ever would be heresy.
---
Yeah for real. I remember making all of my in game friends out in the world. We'd be in Southern Barrens, I'd save someone from dying to an elite/quest mob. We'd /nod or /salute and be on our way. Lo and behold, 10 levels later in STV, I'd be getting ganked and who was it that came to my rescue? THAT SAME PERSON. That could never happen in retail. Whether you leveled fast or slow, the people you saw in the barrens would be the same people you saw in the later zones. Maybe they were finishing the zone as you were starting, but still. Then you'd do dungeons with the same people, see them in battlegrounds, end up joining or making a guild together. Guys I am so hyped for Classic. 
---
I think you wish has been granted from what I saw in the beta.
---
They really pushed it as a hardcore mmo, their marketing revolved around it. Both the raiding and pvp. Stuff like this in their marketing comes to mind: http://wildstar.bigdamnheroes.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/raidsmash.jpg 
---
Pretty sure thats official but not 100% certain.
---
Pretty sure it was increased to 25 in TBC
---
Umm you realize that kick and pummel are interchangeable right? and fury warriors have to tank all the time because guilds usually only run 2-3 dedicated prots and you need more than that on mc dogs, sulfuron, domo, razorgore, post suppression room trash and especially in AQ40 on the trash. 
---
I've never said I couldn't play without aoe loot. Get the fuck out. 
---
I thought the word after skyline was "chili", it made sense to my Northern Kentucky brain. Unrelated I just felt like sharing. 
---
Eh. Not 90% of my games but probably 50% were just getting stomped by prems. People dont even try at that point. And why should you? The faster its over the faster you can take your 1 mark and hope for a non prem game.
---
If you think people arnt minmaxing more (premming more) in the private server community you’re delusional. These arnt your average braindead retail babies- they at least had the drive and ability to get connected to an older version of the game.
---
This behavior will carry over to retail. You’re delusional if you think you can replicate the retail vanilla experience with zero tweaks. I’m not even calling for any btw, this is simply a fact.
---
It matters regardless of the expansion if you're doing any content with other people. If you click, your reactions are slower, your can't move and use abilities, you lose out no matter how you look at it.
---
With that said, you play how you like when you're alone or doing content that doesn't matter. 
---
I had a good friend who used to unironically refer to wow as a graphical chat room.
---
He would spend all day talking to people in guild chat and fishing.
---
I hope they got that regen figured out from the demo. It was way to much. Them ion says at BlizzCon they felt they were having to stop and eat too much. That’s vanilla.... they can’t leave us with that much regen or ill level super fast with no downtime. Plus I don’t have to buy food either.
---
Being able to compare what I'm looking at to what I have equipped without an add-on.
---
And possibly the vendor price.
---
In Vanilla and TBC my server was pretty good about making it known when someone was a ninja looter. None of us kept a written "blacklist" as far as I know either.
---
That being said, this mainly worked because by the time I had played enough of the game to be looking for gear we all had a good sense of the community and names were easy to recognize. I can see how it could be abused, especially in the early months when no one knows who anyone on the server is.
---
Either way, I don't think it's that big a deal. Just because some dick ninja'd the item and is now demanding 500g for it doesn't mean I'm gonna pay his fuck ass. I'll still report them like the old days and move on. 
---
I could be totally wrong here, but I'm pretty sure auto attack does start when you use one of those abilities. It DOESN'T start if you are pushing the button but don't have enough rage/energy to use the attack. So the purpose of those macros was to start your attack, even if you didn't have the resources to use the special ability.

**{EU} &lt;Pertento&gt; RP-PvP, Alliance dedicated raiding guild recruiting!**
---
**Philosophy**
---
At Pertento we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. We value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
It is also our desire to circumvent the min-max culture that is omnipresent in the current iteration of WoW, and that has unfortunately also burrowed its way into the vanilla WoW scene. By ditching the elitist attitude we have made room for other classes and specialisations that are considered feeble by many players. As a result we are not simply playing a game of spreadsheets, instead we provide players with the choice to focus more on the role they want their class to play in group encounters.
---
That said, we are a dedicated raiding guild (we prefer to avoid using the term hardcore) and that means our expectations of raiders are high. We expect everyone attending raids to be fully prepared, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’ class. We will strive to clear content timely and will adjust our core raiding team appropriately if deemed necessary. There will also be room for more casual players who occasionally want to attend a raid.

i use keybinds for all the important stuff, but i'll still be clicking lots in classic because it's easier for me to see the position of a spell on the screen than to remember SHIFT+CTRL+5 = downranked heal spell or whatever other 100+ abilities i might need access to at any given time

But with loot trading they may not KNOW about the ninja. If person A joins a raid and wins an item where person B was the other person rolling and the raid ends, party disbands. Person A whispers person B and says "hey, I just got an upgrade again over that item you wanted, but hey, I can still trade it if you give me 100g" there isn't any outside knowledge of person A's ninja and its impossible to call them out for it.  
---
Or another scenario:
---
5 man group, 3 guild members (tank, hunter, paladin) and 2 pugs.\\
---
item drops that for this argument everyone can roll on, say a weapon, so the 2 pugs want it for themselves. the tank guildy needs it so all 3 guildies roll on it. So rather than a fair 1 in 3 chance for anyone to get it, its 3/5 chance for the tank and 1/5 chance for either pug because if any guildy gets it they can give it over to the tank and the pugs may never know.   
---
While I don't necessarily care one way or another I do see the argument where loot trading could lead to what would be in my mind ninja looting.
---
Yeah, I don't envy the developers jobs because there are hundred decisions like this which they need to argue that are far more central to the gameplay and no matter what they decide to go with they will have alot hate for it. Personally I'm really satisfied for what we heard at blizzcon panel. Atm people (atleast that I know) are going crazy atm with the wild speculations during this long radio silence. There is certainly use to get the pitchforks out at some point, but I prefer to have something to be angry about first.
---
In Vanilla, I experienced relatively little ninja looters or corrupt master looters due the fact that the servers' tight community would ostracize such people when their acts would get posted on world chat and social media (with proof). Players (if not entire guilds) would get put on black lists and not raided with again.
---
I think the same deterrent would work if loot trading was implemented, and if it's still too easy to exploit, then simply reduce the trading time to 10 (as people realize the item was given to the wrong person almost immediately), and prevent loot trading from happening from outside the group.
---
The only reason to nerf would be if there was something breaking the economy and was considered unfair. Private severs felt they need to do this because they ran at 4x the original population and many (most?) were doing shady stuff on the side with gold sellers. It's debatable which contributed more to the economy issues they had. Back in vanilla blizzard went through several rounds of changes to address economy issues and gold sellers that will be reflected in 1.12. I wouldn't think they'd need to do more than that this time around. 
---
But even without dm there are plenty of farming spots where mages excel. Zg, elementals, plaugelands, etc.  People need to be careful banking on becoming rich with dm farming because it's mind numbingly boring and grinding out thousands of gold there will drive you insane. 
---
Now or back then? I feel like back then it would of been removed from your list
---
Excellent point aswell.
---
So catch-up in retail and virtually every other game are different. Because retail causes previous tiers to become irrelevant they must make 5 man's let you skip that content. Catch up mechanics in the most literal meanings of the word and in the common use just means a way to accelerate towards the end game for late comers.
---
DM is also considered a catch up mechanic in terms of vanilla. It adds better prebis gear that gets you into MC faster and more efficiently. The problem is you are looking at the raid tiers and not also including dungeon tiers. DM invalidates a lot of 5 man's as it gives access to some really good gear. Same with dungeon .5 and ZG. What they let you skip to catch up is not MC but tier 0. Or the dungeon tier. They give you gear that'll let you breeze through t1 content without having to trek through as many 5mans.
---
Another example of catch up mechanic could be reduced xp to get to 60 in tbc. This allows players who couldn't get 60 im a timely fashion to get there and start doing the newest expansion. Yet they aren't skipping any content just accelerating it. Anything that causes the latest group of players to have an easier time or ability to progress faster could be considered a catch up mechanic. 
---
I 100% agree that its totally immersion breaking. **That being said**, Classic *needs* sharding / phasing at the beginning. With out it, it will be completely unplayable. 
---
Lets say, that day 1 server pop is 5000. Per a private server, about 26% of active players are humans. So, on launch day, provided launch goes fine and everyone gets in right away, you are going to have 1300 players trying to kill wolves and kobolds out side of North Shire Abbey. Generous estimate, there about 50 total mobs there, with a respawn time of say, two minutes. Leveling becomes impossible, as tagging the mob is pretty much down to ping and luck.
---
Sharding / phasing sucks. But if you want classic to succeed, you will need to either start playing in week 3 or deal with it for a few weeks while the population spreads out across Azeroth.
---
The slippery slope argument is a concern, but based off what we know so far, they are implementing phasing/sharding so you can actually play the game, not just because, or to allow people to easily level up, or what ever other reason. This is an important distinction, they are not going to add phasing/sharding because there are too many people in one place (ie cities or global events), they are doing it temporarily, because leveling up would be pretty much impossible, people would quit, and classic would be DOA.
---
Some people laugh, and the others need an explanation.  He was quoting The Dude. 
---
Seems several have already pointed you to the ranking rewards.
---
Wanted to mention there are rep rewards for each of the three battlegrounds as well.
---
Stick to retail. 
---
Thank you for the long and detailed post. I can definitely tell why having guides is a good thing now. In a perfect world I wish everyone would learn by doing, but obviously not feasible as we live in 2019.
---
Loot trading is where you can trade a BOP item to anyone eligible to have looted that item, within 2 hours of the item being looted.  So...
---
* If I am a rogue, and a hunter and I both roll need on a sword, and then later a mace drops, I can give the hunter the sword and take the mace.
---
* If I am in a run and I click need for off-spec, before someone else who greeded realizes it's an upgrade, I can give it to them.
---
* If I am in a run with Masterloot and I click on xdruidyx instead of xdruidzx, I can give the item to the right person.
---
* *I CANNOT take the item and sell it to someone who was not in the run.*
---
* **I CAN go in as a warrior, roll need on cloth gear and give it to my Mage friend, essentially doubling his chance of winning gear (or up to 4x the chance with an almost-full guild run).**
---
* **I CAN go in and roll on gear I don't need, just for the sake of whispering the other person and saying "I actually don't need it, I'll sell it to you for \[5x vendor value\]"**
---
In the case of the first 3 options, this is what loot trading was intended for.  But these situations are rare, are the player's fault, and to some degree can be rectified through GM ticket.
---
Personally, I don't see the ninja loot (last option) as likely, as that person will get blacklisted from runs.  However, there's much more reason for a hunter to roll on a healing mace if he can get 20g from the healer than if he can get 3g from vendoring it.  There is more incentive there.
---
Where I see the issue is where a guild or a group of friends will bring 3 or 4 players to a dungeon with the express intent of having all 4 players roll "Need" on anything any of them want.  Doing a dungeon with a Warrior, Hunter, Rogue, and Priest, and have a Mage as a PuG?  All three of the physical classes roll "need" on all of the caster gear so the healer can get it.
---
This happened all the time in WotLK when this loot system was implemented.  I know, because if I saw 3+ guildies in a run, I knew they would ninja my stuff.  And if one of my guildies needed something and we couldn't fill the group, we would PUG and we would roll need for them.  It got worse in Cataclysm.
---
TL;DR:  Loot trading is a system designed to mitigate some mistakes and quirks with loot distribution, but it is also more open to abuse by the players.
---
Im going to roll a shaman, I had end game priest and Hunter before, always alliance, For the Horde this time around.  Looking to be involved and social in group
---
Don't Rogues need to worry about positioning for things like cleave during boss fights?
---
Hi, /u/Sleiv16
---
Improved mailbox ui, questlog/proffesion ui, ah ui, modern raid frames, guild bank, calender
---
Karmond's reply below sums it up well:
---
**Vanilla** \- Ninja looter gets an item and vendors it.
---
**Loot Trading** \- Ninja looter gets an item and sells it, or a guild gets a group of 3-4 together to boost another player's rolls.
---
*As a healer I watch half our DPS die within the first 30 seconds due to avoidable causes*
---
“Man, our healers suck!”
---
This shits been out for 14 years and Blizzard spares no expense sans a fucking parade marching through your bedroom to let you know you need to move away from whatever you’re standing on. 
---
Well this got weird 
---
There will be east coast raid times on a west coast server. Not everyone looks at the servers time zone. I’ll just be happy to be on an NA schedule again. Being up at 7am on a Sunday because eu players want to raid at 2 pm their time sucks for us na players. 
---
I didn’t even think about time zones when I first started. Plus, you have to hope your guild picks a time suitable for you. There are people on the west coast who work odd hours who need odd hour raid schedules. I’m sure you’ll find what you need.
---
It matters.
---
Can't wait to beat little elitists like you. ;) 
---
And semptember becuase of the earlier realises, and in the prespective of the alpha and beta. (The 3 last expansions have been realised after 6-9 months after alpha) but do we need and alpha and a beta?
---
I hated phasing in Cata because the mineral nodes were always in a different phase from me.
---
This seems like blizzards text post of this live panel
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM
---
At what? Won't be loot rolls in your world... 
---
Good point, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again for the great info!
---
The first scenario is resolved by significantly reducing the loot trading time. In almost all, if not all, scenarios where a piece of loot accidentally ended up in the wrong hands - it was apparent to the whole raid immediately. 10 minutes would be enough for such loot to get sorted out, as well as preventing players from loot trading outside of the raid/group (**if they trade inside the group or raid it would announce the trade to the whole raid**).
---
The second scenario bears similar resolution. There is never a reason for loot trading to take longer than 10 minutes, and there is never a reason for loot trading to occur outside of the party or raid. All that anyone would need to do is remain within the party/raid for 10 minutes after looting to see if anyone is a ninja.
---
That'd be nice yeah :)
---
It is weird to me that you even play retail at all.
---
You may be right, it might be shit because there's not enough time, but not because there are not enough people. Adding more people (who possibly don't know the ins/outs of classic) to the team won't make things develop faster, it'll just muddy up the challenges they have in front of them.
---
I just leveled a lock to 29, and got kind of burnt out on sending pet, dot, and wand. I know it’s not really representative of 60 play... It is an incredibly powerful solo class no doubt. Rogue is my main love, but I was just trying a different class to figure out what alt I want to play in classic. Trying a warrior out now, and maybe mage next. Maybe I’ll return to the lock, we’ll see. Leveling a rogue is fine, stealth is a huge advantage. 
---
I tested and played Guild Wars 2 up until the first expansion.  I really enjoyed the direction they took with exploration and active involvement in dynamic events.  The action combat wasn't very good for higher ping players like myself though and I've never been a fan of the art style they used for their human character models (not a fan of anime).
---
If you don't want to play a priest, or a paladin, and you want to be a healer... Seems like a weird topic for a thread, it would seem to make more sense if you just asked, resto sham or druid? 
---
I didn't mean some bosses will do that... I mean when you're near 60 doing brd, strats, things like that, because your tank is likely undergeared, he will eat shit and die. Because you can't control his toon, you can only control yours. As a paladin, you don't have shield or hots or anything of the sort. That was the point. Anyway... Enjoy.
---
My friend and I loved exploring in the game and we made many trips to go under Stormwind and going behind the IF bank to get to old IF. We had never tried to get on top of IF airfield or to GM island yet but I remember the day we spent a very long time jumping on the mountain and how good it felt to finally get up on that airfield. Not that there was anything that cool up there haha but glad we didn't try for the gm island considering it was a perma ban lmao
---
There will most likely be an addon that someone will make that will do this.
---
What are you on about? Aoe looting is where you click a single corpse and it shows all the items from nearby bodies as well. That doesn't prevent loot rolling.
---
The benefit is you can have massive realms. This means low AH prices and plenty of guilds.
---
I've still got a record of my vanilla Ninja looting/loot trading experience https://i.imgur.com/JgAaqzs.jpg
---
Cleave hits frontal targets, attacking a boss from the front is a dps loss even without Cleave so being behind the boss as a melee dps is a given and not something you worry about.
---
Good. The entire fan base doesn’t watch streamers. Let the fan boys go. There will be plenty left over. Sure people are watching asmongold and tips out and those guys but I think a lot are just looking for potential information on classic. The amount of fan boys will be minor compared to the majority of players.
---
If you rely on your wand more you save a ton of mana. Also look up the trick where you can drink while moving. 
---
This is why I lol at people mocking players showing screenshots with the 'attack' icon on their bars.  It actually did serve a purpose, especially if something got cc'd in front of you and you wanted to immediately stop attacking. 
---
35/40? I'd say... 20. paladin gathers, consecrate, mage freezes and blizzards, maybe paladin helps with consecrate and cleans up the stragglers. you don't even need to AOE grind specifically, you can just do quest way more effectively as long as there isn't a lot of casters.
---
I don't mind clickers, keyboard turners, or backpedalers- so long as they're not in my faction.
---
I'm with you on aoe looting. Such minor change but a huge convenience.
---
everyone say this but is there proof you ran slower back then?  
---
i played all expansions quite a bit and didn't notice anything  
---
That logic doesn't really follow. The qol changes already exist. Removing the qol changes so the game works like vanilla is why it's taking so long.
---
It worked when bc was about to come out and blizz said transfer or we will transfer you and no guarantee your friends will be with you. 
---
I miss Scarlet Crusade. I only left cuz my friends did. No login q times. Less than 5 min bg q’s. Great small community that was decently balanced. RP servers are the hidden secret of WoW. I don’t even RP. 
---
nice done with comic sans, that's like a whole new level of trolling.
---
Yeah, that's awful. Essentially the main argument against loot trading is that people cannot be trusted. Part of my wishes that things weren't so cynical.
---
Perhaps if loot trading time window was reduced to 10 minutes, not allowed outside of group and would announce itself if occurred... but, I don't know. Thanks for sharing.
---
"Link Molten Core Ahead of the Curve or GTFO"
---
Yes, there are absolutely no issues with achievements.
---
**Release, not realise
---
Classic will definitely need a beta and will be a clusterfuck if it doesn't get one. They haven't announced anything yet, so I think april is ridiculously optimistic. Honestly, I'd be surprised if we get it as soon as August.
---
 "Link Molten Core Ahead of the Curve or GTFO"
---
Yes, there are absolutely no issues with achievements. Stop calling downvotes a knee-jerk reaction when you clearly didnt think it through why people may be opposed to it.
---
Your achievements in Vanilla is standing in Ironforge with full T2 and an Ashkandi being surrounded by level 5 characters inspecting you.
---
&gt;"I didn't read the OP post at all"
---
Thanks for replying.
---
Come on.. If you cant trade soulbound items what is the point of loot trading? Please use your brain.
---
The time invested per character in classic is part of the appeal - for me at least. 
---
Crafting Professions being in-demand and unique.
---
40 players in a raid.
---
No PvP power/resilience (pop goes the clothy)
---
It’s a different game - that felt massive.
---
Where did you get april? Summer doesn't start until June 21st and goes to Sept 23. Summer 2019 probably means a July-September release. April isn't optimistic, it's not in the realm of what they said.
---
These server starts are a one time thing - people will get pissed, others will have a blast - it creates a memory more meaningful than killing wolves in silence.  
---
To start Classic any other way would be hypocritical.
---
I suggest reducing the loot trading window to 10 minutes, not allowing loot trading outside of the group, and announce the loot trading in group chat were it to occur.
---
Aside from that, I don't know. Part of me just hopes things are not as cynical as people make it out to be. I admit I wasn't a victim of loot ninjaing too many times, and I felt like the community did a good job of ostracizing/boycotting the persons and guilds who did. 
---
Thanks for the input.
---
It's possible but beyond 3-4 mobs it'd get really tough.  Paladin doesn't get seal / judge of light until early 30s, so unless all the mobs die quickly the pal will be going down.  The only purpose of the pal in this scenario is to gather mobs (and high armor+shield definitely helps) and then heal a bit / try to drop consecrates.  I think the mage could probably do it just as efficiently themselves using bandages and the occasional potion (easily got if you're grinding a lot) and thus probably get higher xp alone with the paladin taking half of it. 
---
I think once the Pal gets seal of light, consecrate, and blessing of sanc (at level 32 I believe you have all 3 of those) then you can get serious where the paladin holds more of the aggro longer, allowing the mage to avoid pulling aggro until later in the fight and be more efficient with overall mana used to damage. 
---
Blizzard have a track record for doing alphas and betas, so I would expect atleast one of those to come. Apparently these have been about 7 months before the release of the previous expansions. It has been mentioned that September is technically still part of summer so could still be couple of months. Last "official" word for blizzard that I'v heard has been this: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/are-we-at-the-basic-in-game-q-a-stage-of-updates-from-blizz/70092/13](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/are-we-at-the-basic-in-game-q-a-stage-of-updates-from-blizz/70092/13). Usually Q1 (couple of first months of the year) is fairly quiet game development wise so that would give some concordance to it aswell. On the other hand this is a very unique product compared to expansions so I could be wrong about all of it. My personal guess is that we will hear more 4-6 months before release of the game.
---
100 gold repairs per night is unheard of. Either you are bullshitting or your tank was lying. I have tanked all content in vanilla and never even had close to that. If all my gear is full red thats max 20 gold. 
---
ZG and tier 0.5 aren't letting you skip dungeon gear. They are the progression from it. And even then, it's still not remotely the same kind of thing because even if you want to believe that some content is skipped, like say t0 and dungeon blues, then you still have the vast majority of the content ahead of you unlike catchup gear later on in the game. Additionally, the catchup gear is usually entirely 100% better in ilvl than previous raid tier gear, but with Dire Maul, it's superior but only in some pieces and the goal of the dungeon being added was to supplement the gear for bridging the gap between dungeons and MC. You can see that in that most of the preraid BiS gear in Dire Maul is for tanks and healers. DM wasn't intended as a catchup mechanic. And it doesn't function as one. 
---
Don't kinkshame please. Tell her to stop Thommy.
---
If there is an easily abusable system in place where players will profit greatly with little risk to themselves (Remember you cant see who trade the items to whom), then players will abuse it.
---
Anyone that has been playing online games more than 15 minutes understands this.
---
Yes it is possible, but not optimal
---
I’m not talking about the retail vanilla experience I am talking about my experience with private servers.  And I’m not delusional this is 100% my experience with solo q for bgs for the last 5 or so years.  It’s not as bad as you are claiming it, and if you want me to use your own words against you, you are delusional if you think it’s that bad.  This is a simple fact.  
---
Blizzard can't do anything against servers that are in countries that don't see reverse engineered servers as an infringement of copyright law.  And playing on them isn't illegal either , but it is a break of the EULA (End User Licence Agreement)  so technically Blizzard could ban all private server players, but for obvious reasons they will never do that  (it would cost too much, and also they rather have you back as paying customer) 
---
Anyway, what I wanted to say , those private servers are quite safe in the countries where they are hosted now (mostly eastern europe)
---
A lot to keep track of? It's literally just get to 5cp, keep up SnD, Evisc with spare CP. Make sure to use an ability right after your auto hit to maximise sword spec &amp; windfury proccs. Vanilla Rogue, in PvE, is extremely simple. 
---
I think in that case age of 18 or lower would be more viable
---
Priests are pretty nice even in mc, at least if you have a competent group, its a nonstop fight with the shamans for that top healer spot..
---
As for going oom, use your ranks. Skills you use as priest change depending on the gear you have. When my priest started healing it was all heal r3, now its greater r1 or max and 3 ranks of flash.. plus hots and shields and pi's. Plenty of stuff to keep track of.
---
Starting from 1.1 was never on the table. I cant believe people actually thought this was a realistic option. The early patches have way too many easily abusable mechanics and imbalances that are too well known.
---
Yup, it is something that will affect how vanilla works. That was a constant thing you had to manage and is part of the vanilla experience.
---
This...would actually make it worse.  It would still be easy to abuse, but by the time the mistake is realized it's more likely to be outside the window.
---
Remember when we were learning MC?  The raid leaders would scream... "No heals to ranged!"  And we would watch all the mages, locks, hunters, etc. get one-shot by those wonderful little charcoal fire mobs.  Until we learned to 'rally round the flame' for those.
---
One of the best fights to see if your pre-raid players has understanding of the debuffs is the Rend fight.  Those dragons put on those fire debuffs, they are being feared and maintained by the locks / priests etc. by being feared and/or rooted by druids -- and yet, fury warriors, rogues, and main tanks will go in to fight -- and there's not enough mana for a young priest to keep everyone up and people die in their quest to hit the top of the dps charts. 
---
Those who are not aware, also stand around waiting for Rend to enter, not having potted, bandaged, etc.  And WTF their healers when they die.  
---
We used to gauge recruits by their dps, their willingness to help and more importantly, their situational awareness.  Included were healers -- did they just heal, or toss in a well-timed fear if a mob was beating up on one of their other healers -- or did the healing recruit have enough sense to fear themselves and/or fade.
---
We used to 'ping-pong' mobs off of healers with timed heals and fade.  Let them run the whole way across the room, and then fade, causing them to go back to their previous target.  
---
I can't wait to ping-pong again.
---
If you need an artificial achievement screen to tell you that you cleared Blackwing Lair I dont know what to say.
---
Isnt knowing you did something enough? Or are you one of those basic people who seek constant validation through being able to show everyone else that you did X and Y?
---
The only thing i want changed, is to not have my undead wear rags. I mean i know i may have lost a piece or two of flesh, but i just crafted that robe..
---
You have too take things with a grain og salt, what i ment was that their is under preasure from the board with their financial status. That it could be pushed forwards and realised before we think it will.
---
I’ve said this this before. I don’t know that I agree it will be DOA, but it will mean that a big chunk of folks will be frustrated with the lack of mobs if 500+ people are rolling around in Deathknell tryna kill the 5minute respawn Quest mobs.  
---
Also, if you think there won’t be trolls sitting on quest mob choke spawn points going for instant tags to further slow people’s progression, you don’t know the wow community very well.  
---
Shards help this problem.  Or make Quest mob choke points instant spawn/10 second spawn until traffic dies down.  
---
Sitting in deathknell because you can’t progress your main quest for a few days because Samuel Fipps dies before he renders is not fun and not classic.  
---
&gt; it’s pretty gamechanging in guild politics and a lot of social things not to mention the whole idea of gearing being a hard long grind which feels rewarding in the end when youre decked out in BiS
---
Aoe loot is when you kill 2 mobs and you click 1 corpse and it shows the loot of both mobs. What does that have to do with guild politics and social things? Aoe loot does not have anything to do with raiding or whatsoever, it's literally just aoe loot. But it's not something I can't live without, I was just answering to your post.
---
Is... *is* that an animation?
---
It will negatively effect you yes, especially if you're horde or sword-spec. Also it's right after your Main-Hand white hit.
---
Playing alliance daggers it would effect you the least.
---
Honestly I can see why you'd be overwhelmed at the beginning but after you're familiar with the fights you'll probably be begging for something else you can do, and this is it.
---
Is nobody reading the OP post at all? I never said I was having mana issues with Priest.
---
OP said april, not me. I called it ridiculous. 
---
"greatly" may be an exaggeration. There's only two points where my quest log is full during 1-60. One is when I start early STV/Desolace and try to juggle the followups from shimmering flats and various other breadcrumb quests, the other, Un'Goro.
---
Otherwise 20 quests are fine.
---
Yep. I enjoy exploring games and finding things unexpectedly, but I have rl priorities, so I will utilize guides and such to help make sure when I do play, I am not wondering around aimlessly. Since I will be limited on time, I will want to make sure I am making progress in the game. I say there will be a lot of players like me.
---
And also make it harder to complete that instance with a group.
---
Ya i believe so too. Should be possible when hobby Modders can make client side Modell Mods then Blizzard should be too but i think they will just say "its about full Classic Feel" something i would say but they say it because they dont want todo more work :D
---
Unrealistic. The cumulative understanding of millions of players for over a decade will impact your raiding experience. Regardless of how your raiders start, some will rise to the top and look for ANY advantages they can in a competitive atmosphere. Take an avid raider who knows the strats and can recite them by heart, or take a group of guys who have never played but when you get to the first boss, SOMEONE will know the strat and that information WILL impact your group. No way around this. This, in essence, is why you can NEVER have a truly authentic experience.
---
Sweet, so hour long queues. Shit tons of lag. Servers down for days on end. Server populations wiped in half simply due to a poor launch. 
---
Wows launch was such a shit show that people were spread out simply because only a few could log on at a time.
---
There are something things that should be updated and fixed to make a playable game. 3 weeks of phasing in under level 20 areas is just fine.
---
Yeah that's my thinking as well. I really don't want to lose out on that side of the game for a few instances of (possible) frustration. On top of that, the majority of the player base goes on PvP servers which further reinforces the strength of those servers.
---
It *could* be, but if it was 3 months out we'd be seeing something. We haven't heard updates about a lot of details, and no announcement for open/closed beta. And activision is sitting on piles of cash, with BFA still bringing in millions every month, plus overwatch and hearthstone. They're doing OK even if it's pretty bad compared to their peaks.
---
Very valid points. 
---
Rogues will still do good compared to most other classes even if you don't worry about it , it also wont be the hardest thing to get use to if you have something to show when your white hits will happen :) and having a little something like this to work on and improve with can make some boring raid fights more enjoyable
---
Rogues sap before a fight so theres that.
---
I think it'd do perfectly fine!  I think it's WAYYY more important that your leadership and management (GM and Officers, or what-have-you) know how to manage people.  Regardless of if you know how to do a raid or how to min max a character, as long as you have solid leadership and management when it comes to raiding, you should be totally fine!  I've a couple guilds with great people just crumble because the leadership was wimpy.
---
Bear in mind, I feel like a guild like this could benefit from having some veterans sprinkled in as well.  I can respect the idea of wanting to go into everything blind and learning things as you go, even developing your guild's own strategies.  But if you want to google the mechanics of a fight beforehand, or have a vanilla/private server veteran explain the fight and lead the charge, I personally don't see the harm in that.  It seems like a lot of people really want this authentic experience you're describing, and I think there's a big grey area between "hardcore min/maxing" and "totally blind," and you can strike a good balance (favoring the latter)
---
Personally speaking, I have raided a decent amount on private servers, but I'd much rather be in a guild of noobs!  I just think the experience would be so much fun!
---
&gt;Also, swing timers/auto shot timers... I get that it's not a part of wow officially and I know people will disagree, but for PvE and PvP kiting it's absolutely required.
---
Sure, but not everyone care about playing PvE and PvP at a top level. For players who just want to log in for two hours every week to do some quests with their friends it would be unecessary clutter.
---
Yeah but then you're stuck with a druid at the end. 
---
Ah yes, the only game that gives me vietnam-esque flashbacks just by seeing the thumbnail
---
Each private server... interesting logic. There are lots and lots of reasons they close down or are abandoned. But vanilla servers overall exist for 15 years now, and they don't change anything.
---
But open that box, go ahead. Lets see how a different team will somehow release stuff following the exact same formula as before, and keep the whole game feel relevant. If you don't see the potential for disaster i feel bad for you.
---
In fact just go play BFA, its a direct result of post release changes. Classic is supposed to be museum, so people can play without feeling like they have a time limit. 
---
2.0 is not Vanilla. It's the TBC prepatch.
---
Personally I think the swing timer is mostly important for warriors with slow 2 hander as that gives enemies alot of time to do stuff while you are just sitting there. Other that is kind of in similar position is hunter, but I think that you can manage the hunter one with just going by the feel. With rogue I think it becomes abit ridiculous, but my knowledge isnt the best possible as far as rogues are concerned. With that being said most everyone played vanilla without swing timer and did alright and the silent majority of people that are gonna be playing the game wont give a shit about these things. Just the fact that you are aware of these things will probably put you ahead of most people. Also one thing that I would say to people struggling with their choices of class is that most people will take couple of months to level to 60 and there is plenty of time to level 3-4 characters to max level in that time if you put the effort to it so you have plenty of time to test out couple 10-30 lvl characters which you think you might like and commit to the one you think you like the most.
---
I don’t think it will come out in 3 mounths ekthet but when do you tink we can expect an news update and wich month do you think will be launched?
---
Play an alliance dagger rogue. You don't need to worry about swing timer at all and they are very conpetitive dps. Also you get to be a special snowflake. I, for instance, was a male dwarf. 
---
I meant as a toggle ability on the interface menu. If you don't want it, you don't have to play with it; but for something that important you shouldn't be forced to install addons.
---
I really like your notion about having some veterans steering the ship to some extent. They'll probably identify potential imbalanaces that might eliminate the authentic vanilla experience. Note taken.
---
Having an automated tool to find members for your groups will lower the need to make friends and engage socially with other players in order to find groups.
---
I dont know why this is so hard to understand for all you people suggesting automated systems to bypass aspects of the game.
---
Sharding. All of these points are true...
---
But.
---
Try to think of how horrible sharding is for *hunters.* After it was implemented I remember while on a taxi flying over an area and what do you know, a rare that only spawns once every once in a *great* while had spawned and was roaming around.
---
I got on my mount and ran into the area only to see the rare disappear *right in front of me* because I'd switched shards. I could go about 20 feet away into the next zone over and the shard would switch back. I could see it! I could almost *touch* it!
---
It was just outside of my range. There wasn't a thing I could do.
---
No sane hunter is going to group with another to tame a rare like this, so you can't game the shard switching to get them.
---
Taming camped rare spawns was hard enough before sharding - now it's damn near impossible.
---
if you're getting cleaved as a rogue...you're doing it wrong
---
Fairly accurate, had a friend who use to run around the tree in Stormwind trade district for hours on a mount. (Holding W+A keys) While chatting. They added an object in cata that blocked him from doing this and immediately quit.
---
When I told him they were releasing wow classic his first response was “can I run around the tree again?”
---
Ye on some servers rocket helm will always bring you to your target as long as it goes off. The rat can be looted everytime it dies and you get it in the barrens. They walk around the dwarf mine.
---
In my experience, most if not all mistakes were spotted the second they occurred. It would be easy to abuse, but it would prevent hidden abused that couldn't be posted on social media. But if you say that guilds are somehow immune to stigma, well ...
---
Either way, I see now that there is no easy solution to this problem, if there truly are as many vile rats out there as people make it seem. Sad.
---
This is the correct answer. Zero buffs, zero heals, zero dispels or decurses. Literally the only utility rogues bring are interrupts if ever needed and one little moment of glory in the suppression room of bwl. Aside from that it's just pure dps without having to care about much. 
---
If you're using HoJ it matters (not very much but still).
---
I stopped at 119 as well due to boredom but recently resubbed and hit 120. The second I did, like 6 more dungeons opened up along with one raid. Been having fun since. Gonna hit 350 ilvl soon and another raid will open up for me then. Been doing mythics and found that people talk way more if we fuck up a mechanic to try and figure out what we're doing wrong (with the timer ticking) vs lfg where we rarely speak because we steamroll everything. Last time I had a retail account was in WotLK, so I like how BFA ripped me out of my comfort zone and forces me to learn encounters or die constantly.
---
keep slice and dice up and dont die
---
congrats youre in the top 10 dps of the raid
---
The guy is a troll. Dont upvote this.
---
The LFG tool is not automated, people really need to understand what they're talking about before trying to bash it.
---
Just let people play how they want.  Who made you the fascist leader of Classic WoW?
---
I feel like I'm getting crucified if I want to use a fucking quest helper becuase, "that's not the way the game was meant to be played," crowd.
---
Players will only profit if they're selling the item: then you'll know who's a ninja.
---
Or are you concerned about people "profitin" by rolling need on gear their friend might need but they don't? If you seriously fear that will corrode the game then you must be expecting the following:
---
1. You're being grouped with at least 2+ premades most the time. 
---
2. They're always able to roll need on the same items. 
---
3. They're actually being despicable enough to always do it.
---
4. No one will ever notice. 
---
Especially requirement No. 4 makes this corroding the game scenario super unlikely.
---
IIRC you can only roll need on items you're able to equip. And even if you're able to equip an item most of the time it will be obvious if an item is not actually an upgrade for you, so people will easily notice if you're just ninjaing for your friend. So ninjas will be called out, just like back in the day. 
---
Besides, I believe they are not nearly enough players who are despicable enough for this ever to become a serious problem (No. 3). Of course players will abuse it, but if it's supposed to "corrode the game" it needs to happen all the time. Yes, I have played enough online games, and assholes like that are usually an absolute minority (although sometimes the minority might be a very vocal one). 
---
anyone who loots the ore/plans/green items and leaves the fucking fruit or cheese in the chest for the next person to find deserves to be shot
---
You are missing what catch up mechanic actually means and just replacing it with how it is used only in terms of gear in retail. The research in Legion as well as the AP nerf amounts in bfa are both catch up mechanics and you don't skip any content.
---
Catch up refers to something that does nothing to the front runners and boost the back end. If in retail they made dungeon gear and previous raid tier gear scale as time went on that would be a catch up mechanic and not skip content. 
---
Well people cant be trusted. That is just a fact. People will screw over anyone as long as they perceive the benefit to be greater than the risk. Why implement systems that allow such behaviour?
---
It'll be the same as running a guild in a new expansion.  How silly can this question be?
---
All you need to do is put together a guild and do it.
---
Meh. For 99.99% of bosses this translates to standing behind the target at a slight angle. 
---
The main reason being that it would affect the economy. Gold per hour from farming, especially as an AOE class (thinking DM farming) would be quite a bit higher.
---
It's definitely a QOL change but not one that should be in Classic IMO.
---
I played during the original launch, never had much of an issue - biggest problem was the loot skating bug.  
---
I also played during several private server releases were populations were larger than 5k and things went pretty smooth - yeah there were a lot of players but we figured it out.  A day after the dust settled the low areas weren't very busy.  In all it was a fun time.
---
Just reread your original post, it didn't mention lag, queues, or down time.  Do you think phasing and sharding will help?  I'm no network engineer but I don't think login servers are part of that.
---
I'm going to create a guild for Classic with some of my friends who are interested. It'll be social guild that ends up raiding a couple of nights a week together.
---
Hoping to get enough people to feel like there is always people to talk to and assist with questions or dungeons, while not being big enough to feel drowned out by all the noise. There is value in feeling like everyone in being able to contribute and have a voice.
---
Many of us would be more on in the late evening due to work schedules and general lifestyle. If you're interested in joining at all, please let me know!
---
* Intended region - NA
---
* Intended server type - PvP
---
* Intended faction - Alliance
---
* Intended raid/play times (with timezone) - Raid times will be 9-11pm PST a couple of nights during the week.
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, RP, Social experience, etc) - Social Experience
---
* Any pertinent rules. -  Will use a form of EPGP for loot eventually.
---
* A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application) - PM
---
Its very easy with dungeons if youre not a complete dunce. People dont seem to realize theres a "stay" command. yes the complications of pets having a whopping 3 movement commands is too much for most people. Leave him at the door to the instance. After a few pulls, either have him follow you to a new spot, or dismiss him and resummon him ahead. XP I found in dungeons is very good, I think it only took like 2-3 to get to 50+ with my Lupos.
---
I'm EU, and interested for the same reasons =)
---
&gt;You have **to** take things with a grain **of** salt**.** **What I meant** was that **they are** under **pressure** from the board with their financial status. ~~That~~ It could be pushed forward and **released** before we think it will.
---
Oh totally, completely agree with you.
---
I don't really understand lol
---
August or September.
---
Holy shit shut the hell up he has a valid point you blizzard dick sucker
---
And if you remember the «leak» that was on the german servers that we could expect an early release among other things. He had right about other things wich makes IT interesting
---
Thanks for the input smith. I always try and take criticism into consideration. Sadly, vanilla wow will be 15 years old when it releases and their will be competition for practically any farm out there. There is no SeCreT GoLd FaRm 1!! Its all been done before !!!
---
Don't let it discourage you. if you get into raiding and find you would like to min max a little more, the tools will be there to help. The swing timer really isn't as daunting as it may seem. It's a little clunky at first but you quickly get used to it and find a good way to integrate it into your UI and it will be second nature. You really don't need it to be in the top 10, don't pull threat and don't die.. win. GL and have fun rogues are amazingly fun to level 
---
Holy shit it actually happened lmao what the fuck I had hope.
---
I'd like to add one more moment of glory: evasion tanking Razuvious if a mind control gets resisted.
---
Thx grammar police, It’s nice to se that you understand what i mean
---
DPS Warriors can also kick and often offtank. 
---
Not mattering very much is the same as not mattering to most people.
---
No.  It's a huge wall of text and people are just responding to the topic and maybe reading the first sentence.
---
It wasn't my best WoW moment but it's a funny memory; I was a paladin and would join Pug raids in MC, the main problem being that I was still a kid and didn't know that ret paladins were horrible dps, and so I would just sort of follow the raid around MC just watching the fights go on. Well eventually I got bored in these raids and would alt-tab to Halo : Combat Evolved, on my ridiculously slow computer. So I'm playing halo for a little while then decide to check back in and see what's going on in the raid, when the wow screen pops back up I am immediately drawn to my chat log which has a bunch of whispers telling me to run, and also people in raid chat telling me to run. I then look into the upper right part of my screen and see the living bomb debuff that the boss had put on me, but I had no idea what I was supposed to do because I had been playing halo (I also was not in vent, I can't remember if the pug was using one). After maybe 3 seconds of confusion; Kaboom! I exploded and I think I flew up into the air? The explosion killed a huge chunk of the raid and caused a wipe very quickly. Luckily it was a pug, so it wasn't that much of a surprise that it failed. After that the raid disbanded, and I felt a bit guilty and confused, but now it's just a funny memory.
---
I did this on my own private server, farming on any of the Superservers right now is.....not fun lol. 10k worldwide population means competition around the clock. Wont be like that come classic release.
---
Thanks for your input schepp
---
You don't have to worry about your swing timer at all. It's a marginal dps increase at best. Just focus on the important things and you'll be good (never waste energy, keep SND up, press your cooldowns at good times).
---
What? 
---
Might depend on class.  As elemental or enhance shaman, I went from being able to Thor my way through pulls of 5 or six mobs to it being a life or death struggle to pull two mobs.  My secondary stats plummeted and were replaced with the anemic psuedo trinkets of Azerite.  Even post cap, mob strength scaled to a lesser degree with Ilvl, meaning that they kept pace far longer in the open world.  
---
It didn't help that both those specs were in a woefull state that was not addressed as advertised.
---
Calling the grammar police is fine when you're literally murdering the English language.  
---
I never do that when there's a few mistakes.  It's special just for you.
---
Youre coming at this with a very strong misconception. The reason dungeons are harder to do at lower levels is because the level difference makes glancing blows, misses for melee, crushing blows for tanks and spells resists for casters very high. This means DPS and tanks have a very hard time doing damage and taking damage. It doesnt have to do with having a slightly higher rank spell, especially for Priests and Druids, since youll almost never even use your highest rank heals for anything. 
---
The reason healers can heal at lower level is that they dont have to interact with the higher level mobs themselves and just heal player targets. Level 58 is an arbitrary level, its no magic level that suddenly makes you a better healer. Its just the lower level you are, the less stats youll have (very gradual), the bigger aggro radius and the easier youll die if you pull threat.
---
Are you running dungeons by yourself or in a group?
---
If by yourself, then you're abusing a flaw in private servers in how XP is awarded (mobs have to be green to you on live).  If in a group, then isn't your group upset that you're giving up a big portion of your DPS to leech XP?
---
The amount of times I have warned people they are in fire only to watch them keep standing in fire.....that's usually when they stop getting heals.
---
I went through all of BC leveling without carrying food or water. The occasional time that i did go OOM and low health was annoying 
---
He has no idea what he's talking about.
---
Warlock life taps all his hp "HEAL ME WTF"
---
Good info, hey keep me updated!  I feel like I will feel similar to you...Rogue is calling my name.
---
Thanks for that you think I am special, sad that I just find that funny. And it’s sad that you haven’t anything else to do.
---
Because retail players like one type of game and classic players another. Retails players already ruining classic with all the “changes” they want. Classic is supposed be for players that do not like retail. Of course retail players can play classic as well but I don’t think there should be any connection between the two.
---
Should there be events in classic for retail as well? It just doesn’t make sense. 2 different games should be kept separate
---
Yeah, it totally changes the economy.  Now you can save 5 seconds when looting.  My GPH just shot through the roof...
---
You are all so strange.  Just the other day someone mentioned that they don't like auto loot being added to the game.  Because it's ENTIRELY different when you have to press shift.
---
What, cause you can see farther than 12 feet? It should be illegal to have that short of a view distance in 2019. 
---
Wow came out back in the day of 256mb video cards and 512 sticks of ram, with Pentium 3 CPUs. 
---
Git gud
---
You absolutely should. 
---
I'll be getting addons for those two, auto sell junk, auctioneer, bagon, and a whole host of other QoL changes.
---
Let me know the server and faction, when we get there, and i'll defintly join the no-clue-about-vanilla guild
---
^^^ u/Shirtwearer1975
---
Oh man, this is beyond true but I'm more then willing to roll a shaman and go restore like the first time I played the game.
---
3 paragraphs is a "huge wall of text" to you?
---
rofl
---
/invite isnt the same as auto invites
---
Technically they came in 2.0 and the increased level (61-70) as well as all of the content was locked for about a month.  Patch 2.0 actually came out a month before TBC launch date.
---
Patch 2.0.1 - December 5th 2006
---
TBC Launch - January 16th 2007
---
I’m both a retail and classic player and I like both types of games for different reasons.
---
It, like most things is not black and white. 
---
Raid finder and flying
---
Kidding! Calm down, everyone!
---
Thank you for the video!  Great talking pace and clarity.   I’ve played on a few private servers and now I’m finished until the real deal - can’t wait to have good ping again! 
---
There's two sides to this. 
---
Small scale scenario:
---
Imagine you and your fellow UD adventurers fight and kill hundreds of Scarlet Crusaders in Tirisfal Glades, conquering strategical towers, slaying commanders, and after you've successfully completed all the missions and you see those towers ever again you notice nothing has changed at all, SC still is in complete control of those areas. 
---
A little grander scale scenario:
---
If you clear BRD, slay their emperor. At the end of all the killing and the quets against them you're supposed to have crippled their structures at the very least. An impressive and definitely not so small victory. Yet nothing happens, nothing at all, despite in your inventory (and exb bar). Said victory is never noticeable. 
---
I know that's the very nature of MMORPGs, but that's something that definitely hurts immersion for me, always has. It's something that gets mended at least a little with phasing. If an important stategic camp is secured, you're in control of it afterwards, if an important person dies, it's dead. I definitely don't want phasing in Classic, and phasing definitely hurts immersion in its own different way, but the complete absence of phasing also comes with immersion detriments. It's not black and white, I'd always keep that in mind. 
---
As a causal Blizzard shill, I can confirm that we have indeed taken over this sub. Prepare yourself for our rein.
---
I think people are still negative towards them, but you can only post about something so many times. I think the majority of people are just waiting for some kind of news from Blizzard
---
uwu
---
Good point, because there is absolutely no difference between 
---
* leading/finding people who are willing to refrain from using modern search engines and commit their time to relive authentic vanilla experience
---
and 
---
* leading people who are not obliged to adapt their gameplay, and can basically do what they please as long as the guild progresses
---
Think long term not short term. 
---
C'mon guys, they're clearly trying to help the healers top the healing meters.
---
I would think they need to make them resistant to frost. I'm pretty sure back to back blizzards make for most of the farming sequence of lasher groups.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
That’s cool. It’s just my opinion. I guess I honestly don’t mind an event in retail to point to classic. 
---
Maybe have an NPC or something, maybe a short quest would be nice. As long as it doesn’t actually affect classic experience.
---
You can search for all those and find plenty of debates on it. More will pop up again. It's just slowing down. And considering the rest of the posts are people shitting on BfA and saying "Can't wait for classic." I don't see where you get the Blizzard shill idea. 
---
Yes, because repeatedly typing "/2 DPS LFG BRD, Scholo, Strat" for an hour is so much more social than using a tool...  Get off the high horse.
---
You still have to send an invite and talk to the person.  If you're randomly looking for other players to run dungeons with you are only helped, not hurt, by having a tool you can use outside cities.  
---
Your claim goes completely against the experience that there were actual server communites in vanilla, where you ran into the same people often and developed a reputation on your server.
---
I was 1 year old. A gnome, I guess.
---
Aoe leveling is not a thing on fresh servers
---
Yeah, I definitely wouldn’t want it to effect the classic experience.
---
Just like a mini holiday to celebrate the pre release.
---
Great, 37 more to go. 
---
AOE GRINDING IS EVERYTHING
---
I'm only telling you what I, and the two others you responded to so far, did when looking at all the text.
---
Man you started young XD
---
I'm looking for the exact same thing and I know others are. We could make a discord or something 
---
2. [ Looking for Group ] Warriorass: "Need 2 more DPS for Strat dead."

There are as many different ways to play wow as there are players 
---
Tauren warrior. Was a casual member of a guild that only killed a couple bosses in nax. Never saw nax myself but got to do some MC BWL and 20mans. I think they felt bad for me lol. I was super bad at the game back then.
---
Yeah, it would suck to end up with one character that can tank, dps or heal - and easily solo lower lvl dungeons for gold.
---
How does that sound foolish at all?  If you want to put together a guild like that then go do it.  
---
You're asking about doing something.  I said go and do it.  You called that statement foolish.
---
Look at the top upvoted *replies* on the recent threads on these topics. The majority now don't think loot trading is a big deal, they want a toggle for BFA-models, etc.
---
They could be made inspectable only by friends and guild-members you have had for 48 hours.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
definitely. And again, if you're new to raiding in general, the guides will put you in a position to execute. Staying alive, doing the mechanics, adapting when shit does go wrong, and perservering is a lot of the fun in raiding once you know the mechanics from a boss fight guide.
---
Don't forget, back in the day it was powerpoint slide decks with drawings of the boss, diagrams etc. Really only a fraction of the community even in 2005 was truly discovering strategies. Some people innovated or tried new things but the reality is that learning from doing it and dying takes an insane amount of effort and skill.
---
You have to fight the boss, stay alive and then pick up on the queues for what is happening. There is a reason in retail, when the guilds race for world first kills they spend over a week slamming their heads against the boss scrutinizing it. Vanilla isn't retail but id you are new to raiding it is hard nonetheless. 
---
Good idea.
---
&gt; How silly can this question be?
---
That's what made your previous statement sound foolish. Then the foolishness was amplified by your "Just do it" attitude, without absolutely no planning/advice from others. It's one thing in theory, and another in practice. 
---
In a simulated vacuum that would lead to a minute difference in gold over a period of days.  
---
Do you log out of the game?  Does your schedule change from day to day?  The time you saved with AoE looting over hours can easily be eclipsed by going to the bathroom, grabbing a glass of water, or sending a few text messages.  It's really not that big of a deal.
---
Just to add another legitimate voice to the debate, here's one of the Nostalruis people during the recent AMA:
---
&gt; “I cannot remember the exact statistic, but loot trading tickets were roughly 1/4th of the tickets we received from max level characters.”
---
Clearly they saw this as a problem. Their solution, though, seems to swing way too hard in the other direction: They banned all loot trading.
---
Yikes.
---
 Guild rule: You can't trade loot items to someone else you spent your DKP on. If you do, you and that person are kicked from the guild. Problem solved.
---
You know that mage would have to be in the group right? And (assuming all the other members are even able to roll need) it's extremely obvious if 3 people who don't actually need an item as an upgrade and are in the same guild roll need on the item as well.
---
That's just a straightforward case of ninja looting and said guild will get an appropriate response from the community. 
---
The instant you mention the word shill you discredit any of your points, though to be fair you didn’t have one to begin with. 
---
Tank\*, DPS\*, heal\*. But hey you're an AWESOME flag carrier in WSG. 
---
\*Can only tank 5 mans and MAYBE ZG or super overgeared old raids. Your dps will be shit as a moonkin compared to other casters and shit compared to warrs/rogs as feral. Healing consists of hitting a downranked healing touch over and over and still getting outhealed by other classes. 
---
Oh man, nax was so hard but so much fun at the same time. Also I vividly remember raiding mc and zg.
---
Nothing wrong with either of those things 
---
No one wants to hear the same thing over and over. We've heard zero news and don't even know how any of those things will be implemented, just that they probably will be; with the exception of spell batch which is probably gone. In the case of spell batch, only a small minority actually care, since it was an artifact of shitty hardware and not intentional... It was effectively built-in lag. No one is really sad to see it go except for the ultra-competitive PvPers who want to abuse it against new players who don't understand it and aren't used to it.
---
ppl do care, however, atleast to me, its getting tiresome to see posts about sharding and loottrading every day and spellbatching like once a week just recycling the same posts more or less. 
---
I guess the general stances towards these are mostly known, and we need to see what alpha / beta brings to discuss more. 
---
Also i reckon if you want to complain the official forums would be a better spot to voice your concerns. This is just fans having conversation with fans, or atleast it should be.
---
It's still a great class if you don't want to get stuck in one role. It may not do anything best, but it does everything reasonably well.
---
&gt; I also was not in vent, I can't remember if the pug was using one
---
pugs having their own voice chat in 2005?
---
Remember that it meant having your own server, back then.
---
I was in a dungeon and got a [Hand of Edward the Odd] thanks to everyone rolling need. I got offered 4000G for it and donated it to my guild instead. My GM bought the mats and crafted me a [Core Marksman Rifle] for my hunter main. Thanks Fireblade on Cenarius, whereever you are.
---
Or they at least think the reply has good points, and promotes positive discussions. Not everyone (a lot though) use a downvote as a disagree button. I upvote people I disagree with all the time. 
---
To piggy back on the previous comment its very hard to have a completely fresh "I've never seen this before" moment. This isn't a brand new game, and even then in brand new MMOs only the top 1% of guilds actually have to figure everything out on their own. After 1 kill video comes out it is about replicating and refining the information someone else gathered
---
It's slowly getting filled with reasonable players.
---
I think one of the Nostalrius developers put it best:
---
&gt; “the online gaming community as a whole is pretty toxic and tends to self-immolate. The hate towards Blizzard now may have some roots in truth and honest feedback but my perception is that it's turned into this all consuming hate monster that is ultimately hurtful and counter productive.”
---
As close as realistically possible.
---
Wrong.
---
&gt; perma ban
---
I've seen a video on youtube where someone got just the single character banned, not entire account... for 10 years, and GM called that "permanently". Hell, he's unbanned now XÐ
---
Even on nostalrius launch with 4k players it was a thing, its just easier to get uncontested spots ahead of the curve. There are many hidden places with grouped mobs such as dancing troll village or the unmarked area in arathi south of hinterlands coast. This is on pvp servers btw so that doesnt even count the amount of pve server spots that become safe. Also potential dungeon aoe like SM may be viable depending on how they do xp.
---
 If you really think classic servers with 2-3k player cap won't have aoe leveling then you clearly don't know wtf ur talking about
---
Truly hope that Classic will bring back the game play that naturally nurses community growth.
---
It's obvious, yes.  But there's a big difference between 4 people complaining about someone being a ninja, vs. 1 person complaining about a group.
---
If 4 people are complaining, especially if 4 of them were from different guilds, it's quite obvious.  One person complaining might not be honest and might just come across like someone who's mad they didn't get into the guild (or something like that).
---
&gt;  I also remember being in Astranar, and seeing that red name text of an approaching horde for the first time
---
strange, as mobs had the same one...
---
well, unless you had it enabled in options only for players
---
People dare having fun wrong?
---
And no, there's plenty of ways to play (and enjoy) Classic. 
---
&gt; Unexpected: I remember as a feral druid landing in the Wetlands and seeing the boat to Theramore was arriving, so I landed and went straight to travel form! I got a boat to catch, after all!
---
&gt; 
---
hmm... there was a comment of someone seeing a druid quickly going into travel form, to catch a boat in Menethil Harbor. Maybe it was the same? XÐ
---
I really doubt it will be, because of how weird itemization is in vanilla. There are greens that are BiS over MC epics, and some 1.12 DM loot is practically on par with some AQ loot. 3 pieces of druid T2 was BiS till BC because of how good the set bonus was. At most, people will use it for pugs and 5 mans, just to weed out brand new players. Join a guild and it should be less of an issue.
---
Probably 2 things. People have gotten tired of discussing these topics that have been beaten to death, and people have realized they are not as big a problem as people make it seem.
---
Sharding could be a problem but we have to wait and see if blizzard implements it beyond starting zones. If you think it's an issue from 1-20, you are naive. With little to no competition you will be out of the starting zones in 1-2 gameplay sessions, and if you think it will take longer then there is obviously enough people in your shard and why are you upset? 
---
This community proclaims that blacklisting people was the solution before loot trading, but also seems to think that someone demanding gold for an item in a dungeon is a  huge problem. People needing for a friend is shitty, but not as big a deal as people make it seem. Join a guild and dont pug, if it's happening within your guild take it up with your management.
---
Lastly spellbatching is a joke. If your main complaint about classic is this, you are just out of shit to complain about but need something to hate blizzard for. I really miss the "feature" that would allow my loh to go on CD but not heal my target. /s
---
Yeah you're right there. It's not a BAD class, I would just personally rather play something that's GREAT at their role. Interestingly enough once TBC hit druid became BY FAR my favorite alt class because that expansion made great strides making hybrids much more viable and holy shit did I love the old lifebloom spam playstyle of tbc druids. 
---
Link screenshots on server forum, problem solved. 
---
It's not just obvious for the one who's in that group. 
---
r/4panelcringe
---
Then here is some honest advice.  Running a guild of 40 people is very difficult.  Running a guild of 40 people while ensuring they don't look up ANYTHING about the game is impossible.  
---
Don't do it because you will fail.
---
If you want to run a guild where you as the GM don't look anything up and everyone else is allowed to then you will fail.
---
If you want to run a guild purely of people that have never played Vanilla and won't get a stick up your ass if people go and look up the fights or gear then that's the most reasonable expectation.  Just don't freak out when someone tells you you have the wrong stats on your gear and stop playing with you because of the, "that's not how the game is meant to be played," attitude. 
---
Leveling my 23 Human Warlock through Redridge.  
---
I must have been about 13 at the time and I thought this was the hardest zone in the world...but I LOVED it.  
---
I can't tell you how many times I died and how impossible I thought the "Wanted: Gath'Ilzogg" quest was, but I kept at it, I loved the challenge.  
---
I honestly spent so much time in this zone I thought I'd never leave, but pushing through it was so rewarding, I can't tell you enough. When I think of vanilla, this memory is one of many that come to mind.
---
If I had a time machine I would just buy a lottery ticket or bet on same games. Or buy stocks. 
---
I still have my regular classic wow box and it’s contents. Keeping it for nostalgic reasons :)
---
The main challenge for most people in Uldaman is to not get lost. Having a map is one thing but there are areas in there that are just a waste of time.
---
One thing to consider is also that the dungeon has a massive level spread, so if you go in there at the appropiate level to kill the end boss, the mobs at the start will be green or even grey for you. Bring some mana pots etc. specifically for the end of the dungeon as difficulty picks up hard once you enter the temple.
---
Some decent stuff in here! Some of my favorite parts:
---
&gt;Therefore, it is important for us to have an original build of 1.12 internally, which we can use as a reference. A concrete example of this was what happens when a sorcerer summons a demon while he has already summoned one. In the Blizzcon demo of "WoW Classic," the demon did not disappear at the end as the spell began to work. In "Battle for Azeroth" the pet is despawn at the end of the spell. Many players reported this as a mistake or at least saw it as a contradiction to the original functioning of the summon, so we checked the problem based on player feedback. While many bug reports entered by players are correct, it turned out that this is not the case here. After a thorough review of our 1.12 reference code, we found that we had correctly replicated the classic behavior and that the demon pet actually disappears at the beginning of the spell. 
---
&gt;CBS: How far are you in developing "WoW Classic"? 
---
BB: We were very excited to present our progress in a demo at the Blizzcon and to be able to show our players the Barrens and Westfall in their classic looks again. We've shown players up to grade 19 for all classes, demonstrating that this approach can work. There is still a lot of work to do, including dungeons, guilds, and the auction house. But the basic parts now fit together. We are very confident that all active "WoW" subscribers will be able to travel to "Classic" from the summer of 2019.
---
&gt;OG: Over the last few weeks, we've been very focused on adjustments based on the feedback we got from the Blizzcon demo.
---
BB: Yes, the community was really helpful. We are blessed to have such enthusiastic and passionate fans!
---
Traps, kite, tranq shot. Not to mention managing your pet, weaving your shot rotation, and even occassionally pulling mob packs or bosses and bat boss in ZG strategies often uses a hunter as the charge tank.
---
Completely agree with you. The first section can easily be done with 38-41's. But there's no way you'll get through the last half without the entire group being at least 42+.
---
This place is like the first toe dip in the water that is end game dungeons 
---
You miss the point. For some people half living might not be living at all.
---
I'd rather get incredibly disappointed than set myself up for something that could be compared to life support. 
---
Change my mind. 
---
Fantastic, ill hit them up
---
Google Translate worked surprisingly well here, their exchanges at times didn't even seem translated, lol.
---
You’re nuts this is not only funny it’s real, not cringy at all.
---
I dare you to post it there, you will be mocked.
---
Yeah i feel you... but somehow i can understand some People don't interact with "Strangers" anymore. RP Servers got overflooded by so many Guys from PvP and normal PvE servers and they fucked up so much. Also that GM's don't give a Rats Ass anymore about RP Servers. 
---
I hope RP Servers get back to former Glory when WoW Classic arrives!
---
Dire Maul shouldnt be nerfed it should just not have the camp bug to teleport to the entrance.
---
Also, for what its worth, he has a youtuve channel where he is 'out of character', and he is a lot more likable there. It makes it easier to view his twitch persona as just for show.
---
Started as Gnome Mage, then saw the Dual Shadows pt 2 and pt 3 PVP videos. Swapped to Undead Rogue and left my poor Gnome Mage at level 26 forever.
---
You are right, there are certainly ways around this and its not like its that big of a deal to begin with, but it does undermine effect of the master looter abit. Its one more thing you need to keep an eye on and it might be hard to determine straight away. I'll give you one case as an example. First part of thunderfury drops. It is given to tank A, tank A sells it to someone else for 5000 gold under the table. No one gets to see this. 5 months and lots of MC runs later second part drops and its given to tank A, because he already "has" the other piece. Tank A sells it to the guy he sold the other piece and when the guilds starts the quests for building the weapon itself, the truth eventually comes out and we have a scenario of potentially guild breaking drama. Now ofc this would be a stupid thing to do, but it is a possible thing to do with the new loot rule and its a thing that you need to be aware as guild leader, where as before all you needed to worry about was how to use master looter properly. All these issues will be overcome eventually, but its kind of extra headache just because developers wanted to add a QoL thing that will reduce GM tickets, and part of the game that was never a thing in vanilla. This is one of the smaller issues and personally I don't mind it that much.
---
Yes.  If you've been playing BfA, FFXIV is a breath of fresh air.  
---
I play heal and tank roles and all the healers delivered.  I only played a Paladin tank so far and it's been a blast and I out-leveled all my healer jobs.
---
Asmongold is a huge loser.  I'm surprised he has such a big following.
---
Nameplate view distance.
---
~25 yard nameplates when your abilities had a 30-40 yard range was weird.
---
It's faster in retail than in classic but they scaled up all the model sizes and landscapes accordingly
---
That's on a personal basis. That time accumulated among all other players adds up. It changes the server in ways that are not really tangible to you or I.
---
"Players will be able to TRAVEL to Classic."
---
I know I'm being needlessly paranoid but the way he worded that makes me feel like classic is supposed to be a temporary tourist attraction, a quick distraction from retail instead of a fully fledged game.
---
Yep. Paranoia.
---
Yeah that could work. I think I would actually resubmit to check it out. Maybe. 
---
Yeah, gear score is pretty useless in Vanilla. Most classes usually wear atleast some blues well into aq/naxx, some lvl 55 crafted items are bis throughout the game and several mc items are bis even after clearing naxx
---
Missed opportunity right at the start for a bubble hearth /spit
---
hunter. had a friend once turn on auto shot and go afk to take a shower during onyxia back in the day.
---
he lived and still topped dps meters.
---
Awwww poor gnome, but did someone mention the gnomes.... apparently nope. XD
---
Thanks!
---
Hoping it's just a translation thing... but there's absolutely going to be a lot of people that think of modern WoW as the "real game" as quoted in that interview with Ion (not said by Ion, but someone used the phrase when asking Ion a question).
---
Good idea. Keep us updated.
---
Awww poor gnome, but the question is, did someone mention the gnomes... lol. In all seriousness rogue was such a pain to fight as a shaman.
---
We've got around 6 months to go til launch, the date still isn't even confirmed.  180 days.  
---
Would you rather see another couple hundred posts about the same thing?  
---
Can you send the link to me as a comment?
---
DPS Warrior. Raided through AQ40 in vanilla and Nax on a private server. Never had to do anything but smack enemies around.
---
&gt; At most, people will use it for pugs and 5 mans, just to weed out brand new players 
---
If any problem might occur because of gear score, this one case you are mentioning is the most important of them all imo. That's the case where you PuG the most. And if the only answer is "find a guild, then", then PuG in 5 mans is dead, which was a good portion of social activity in Classic.
---
Really haha I never knew anyone personally who did it 
---
At low levels, rogue is just a shittier warrior.
---
&gt; All thoughout your World Of Warcraft Raiding Career, you have been preparing for this fight, From Magmadar to Magtheredon, Ragnaros to Rage Winterchill, you have learned not to stand in bad things. Well My friends its time for all that experence to pay off because Illidari council is the SUPER BOWL OF NOT STANDING IN THINGS! this fight has So many things not to stand in including: Concencrate, Blizzard, Flamestrike, the general area around the mage guy and much much more. The other amazing thing about this fight is that whenever someone dies no matter how early or late or how preventable or unavoidable their death, that person is 100% guranteed to claim that their healthstone was on cooldown. Cherish these moments folks, you only live once. 
---
Ahhh memories.
---
WoD and BFA literally get in the way of having fun. I was legitametly appalled at the purposeful impediments they put in against any kind of fun except the singular version of the game they want you to play. Fuck you whoever has been making these decisions since WoD. 
---
Rogue, it's why I played them for years. 0 responsibility in raids except in suppression room.
---
Good thing you brought that up. Now I need to add the rule, you have to show me your binding in the do not trade slot tomorrow. Otherwise gkick.
---
That's sort of always been the case though. Even now in BfA, you sacrifice ilvl for items with BiS affixes -- yet the community still uses ilvl as the ultimate proxy for skill.
---
You never had to tank four horsemen? Needed 8 of it warriors for that. 
---
In vanilla retail you would have had to tank on four horsemen.
---
Yes but rogues are still the ones being set to do it, usually atleast. And most raids I have been usually runs with 4 tanks, whereas 1 is often a fury specces tank. All of those fights you mention and most others, 4 tanks is usually more than enough
---
Not in raids they don't, everything is immune.
---
Download a private server of TBC or Wotlk and have some fun yourself! There are single player repacks that reduce difficulty of dungeons so you can play solo.
---
Honestly though it’s not the same as playing with real people. I miss wow. Can’t wait for classic!
---
I’m mostly worried about proc spell damage scaling. It made for a lot of unique builds back in vanilla. For example they’re not going to go to the effort to recreate the spell power scaling coefficient of a shadow oil potion and similar buffs that add up. 
---
Yeah, that should do it and is probably a good thing to do with important items such as these but pain in the ass with every item. There will be some growing pains until things will settle to a new normal to be sure. For best guilds around the loot sharing is probably one of the best things to be added, because most runs will be run under the two hours so loot can be divided in the end, and just one guy needs to pick them up for trading. 
---
These guys LOVE august september dates. I really hope they release at the beginning of the summer so people could... IDK... Have fun over the summer?!?! :)
---
Yeah!  You don't even need veterans to run the guild either.  Unless you know you're not a good leader, or don't want that kind of responsibility, don't be discouraged :D
---
True, but it's on a very different scale in vanilla vs. retail. Usually, a cloth piece of healing gear with higher ilvl will be better than a cloth piece of healing gear with lower ilvl, with off-spec gear being the stuff that would be higher ilvl but worse for you.
---
&gt; "Players will be able to TRAVEL to Classic."
---
This is a very rough translation. The original is "unterwegs sein können", which means "you can be on the road to Classic".
---
What do you mean?  How do you know they're not going to that effort?
---
Because we have no idea if it will actually happen yet, we are all just waiting for another update which will hopefully clarify things people are afraid of.
---
I personally think Classic is the same thing as Mobile Diablo for Blizzard. Where its a a easy out for top profit. That quote and your logic deff goes with what i have thought. 
---
I for one welcome our new Overlords
---
Yeah, no. As someone who has been way ahead of top 5% (top 100ish) on a fresh server, you are not aoe leveling unless you're one of the first people on the server to get to a spot, or grouping with several other people there.
---
Until... another guy in your case blame them for not trying as hard as he does, or for not playing a 100% optimal spec. Now instead of being the best teammate he is an asshole.
---
I think GW2 was on the right path to keep a balance on this with the events / living world stuff
---
to bad the game is boring as hell
---
Don’t forget in the end of exp you can resin and achieve 2 years worth of gameplay in under 30 min
---
Yep. And good luck FINDING 40 players who are likeminded and then KEEPING them during the inevitable wipefeast when you are clearing 1/4 of the content that pugs are. I know, I know, you arent in a rush anyhow... But goodluck finding and maintaining a group of 39 players who are likeminded. They say they are now... But wiping in MC while everyone else is in AQ gear is unlikely.
---
If they were on Twisting Nether, could've been me!  I didn't get a mount for forever, so I was constantly in Travel Form everywhere.
---
So to be clear, you think Blizzard is planning to implement a new loot trading system (different from the one in retail) that is MORE exploitable than the current system that already exists?
---
Please, take your own advice and use your brain. 
---
Yeah, they're a thing if you're the very first person to get to a spot. As someone who's been well ahead of the curve, roughly top 100, aoe farming was really not something you could rely on. You can do it from time to time, but unless you're literally the highest level on your server, the competition you'll have will make it not worth it.
---
Shit tank couldn’t even agro the fire... smh
---
Dude, I don't know where you've been for 14 years, but Blizzard has refused to merge the live servers. To this day, they still try to trick new players into rolling on complete shit servers like Thunderlord with active playerbases of like 65 players rather than just killing off the dead servers for good and merging.
---
You are quite correct. The smart targeting decursive from vanilla was broken very intentionally in the 2.0 API, and is never coming back. This should be a non-issue because updated raid frame highlights and mouse-over casts will allow a player to remove debuffs easily without being a 1-button spam. 
---
I can only imagine how much raiding will be different from my original experience simply due to updated boss mods and the mere existence of weakauras.
---
No, the most funny are actually the guys who says things such as "Dude, I assure you if you wanna raid, don't play that spec" or "Well sorry, you've been in the guild for longer and I consider you a good friend, but this guy is full pre-bis raid / does better at the dps meter than you. I will do what's the best for the raid and take him instead".
---
Rogue is 100% in the faster half of leveling classes once you get past level 15. 
---
Not if they're troll. 
---
Drinking while moving is extremely inefficient considering the time and mana cost of creating the water. And apart from landing killing blows on mobs with like 1% hp as a mage its better to just kill the mob fast with spells and then spend the time saved by drinking.
---
I see posts about the opposite that's y
---
Remember, you don't actually NEED any info you get from youtube. Discover the game all on your own. The videos are just there to milk the cash cow while it lasts 
---
Ion corrected the fellow as well, gave him the "why did you just say that! don't lose more of our companies stock value in one weekend" type of look, you can see this from Ion during the classic wow question panel. with an informative hand gesture
---
gonna need a source for that and when exactly did they do it  
---
Shots fired.
---
The idea though is you create a negative experience by having to spam trade chat for a tank or a healer for Scholo and thus are far more likely to add and befriend those good tanks, healers, and dps for future runs. The moment you add a system where players can randomly find a group through a LFG system you remove any real necessity to form those bonds as finding a group becomes a form group and forget until you get an applicant.
---
I had an Undead Warlock but I was banned for being an edgy 14 year old who said innapropriate things. So I got a 2nd box and messed around, ended up with a level 40-50 Tauren Druid, was as albino as possible. I remember having balance skills and looking for a LW trainer in feralas. 
---
That's what I remember.
---
Troll Shaman named Kenshyn.  I took engineering, I got him to lvl 45, I got fucking fiery war axe for super cheap.  Also I never paid back my guildie for my mount and to this day I feel really bad, but the dude never came back online :(
---
&gt; After a thorough review of our 1.12 reference code, we found that we had correctly replicated the classic behavior and that the demon pet actually disappears at the beginning of the spell. 
---
[Thorough review.](https://youtu.be/Fh1wVvAy4es?t=71)
---
Thanks for sharing! Not a ton of news but always good to hear something. Glad to hear they are taking blizzcon demo feedback seriously!
---
found the guy who asked for sharding XD
---
Not having to constantly screw with your log would not "greatly impact leveling". It would just make it less annoying having to get rid of quests you will end up picking up again when going back to some zone you've moved on from
---
Nobody asked for sharding.
---
It’s just one of the potential options at this stage.
---
Game design makes you social. It is much slower gameplay and that makes you more involved in your character and how you play. I am now leveling in bfa and game is flat boring. I have no desire to do quests or even explore zones because i experience it as a bland product.
---
The whole expansion is pointless...
---
Be in a less shitty guild with less shitty friends. Don't blame others for actually knowing what they are doing.
---
Swing timer is important for any melee class.  Not just rogue.
---
taking extra damage is more rage
---
Hunter.  Going hunter again in classic.
---
It is the easiest class, yes, but I'm actually going hunter first because of the time I'll need to invest in my pets.
---
Not really, no.
---
Farming instance bosses is seriously overrated. If you are looking for gold, get serious with professions.
---
Blizzard is already 0-2 with 2 mobile games. I mean hacktivision..
---
But no really, dont expect any good choices from blizzard anymore. Nothing but a corporation hungry for more money without putting anything in.
---
Do Rogues not use Poisons then?
---
i just sharded
---
&gt; BB: Yes, some of my own memories were also inaccurate. I thought the Warrior's Charge would always get you into battle the way it does today. But it turned out that the charge (Rush) in "Classic" only activates the automatic attack, and only the offensive momentum actually triggers the fight. If you attack a neutral creature and turn off the Auto Attack while your character is still heading toward the enemy, he will come out of the Stun and then walk away as if you were not there , When I verified that on our reference server, I was shocked - but it shows that one's own memory can be fooled after over 14 years.  
---
I'm very happy to see they're considering the smallest details of the game, and I have a lot more hope after reading this interview.  
---
I really hope they look into the speed of fleeing monsters after fear is used. The run speed of some of the monsters on the demo was far too fast. I had one enemy in Westfall run over 80 yards away in just a few seconds.  
---
Lol, maybe you'll meet em somehow in classic.
---
Priest
---
Hey hunter back then was a ton of fun because of the pets also dont forget eye of the beast.
---
Oooh nice Tauren druid, honestly one of my favorite class race combos.
---
Priest is the premier healer honestly. Most healing spells, fade is great, levelling is decent. 
---
I like druid as well, cuz its really simple in raids but I hate how they don't have a regular rez so their dungeon healing isn't really as good and often you may have to tank. 
---
My favorite forum post ever because it’s SO TRUE. 
---
Also: fuck 1 shot the robot
---
He just wants to be carried. 
---
He's still spamming sinister strike wasting his energy while the pally is in bubble xD  
---
Also I'm a petty individual so it really annoys me more than it should that "I walk alone" is the song of choice while he duo rapes people with his buddy
---
Wtf? Part of the reason far sight and eagle eye are useful are because of shorter base distance. Not to mention the removal of fog makes the world appear smaller anyways.
---
Yes also true:p
---
The problem, back then, wasn’t people spoiling the game, it was everyone spoiling every major entertainment event ala Harry Potter spoils lol.
---
[ Looking for Group ] Warriorass: "Need 1 more healer for Strat dead."
---
[ Looking for Group ] Druidhealer: "I will go!"
---
[ Looking for Group ] Warriorass: "We need a real healer."
---
Druidhealer "I miss LFD..."
---
Caution! Lvling in STV is injurious to your mental health!
---
Gbank please
---
Yes it would be pretty ineffective to go off the item level. I think it would be pretty simple to make a new addon that just got tally of your +hit/crit/spell power/attack power etc and ran i through an algorithm to give you a accurate 'gear level score' though.
---
Yeah, main hands a dagger but never uses backstab!? Stands in front of his opponent instead of behind? Of course this was probably very early in his WoW career so we gotta give him some slack haha.
---
gear score isnt a thing in vanilla because being in full raid gear or the gear from the newest raid isnt BiS.
---
Paladin without a doubt. Your heals do half threat since blizzard wanted to prevent paladins from heal tanking, and even if you do pull aggro you can bubble or BoP yourself or stun the mob. 
---
Blessing of Salvation is super amazing, if your DPS are threat capped it lets them do 42% more dps. DPS still managed to pull aggro? BoP or stun.
---
Paladins are also by far the most mana efficient healer at low gear levels. Blessing of Light + low rank Holy Light is incredibly good, and outperforms even priests that maximize their time outside the 5 second rule. 440 healing done for only 35 mana spent with 0 bonus healing is something other classes can only drool over.
---
horde: shaman, aliance priest. both r best in aoe healing and u need ton of it in raids and in 5 mans too. 
---
I'm down too!
---
After 24 months release a small update, only add a Karahzan raid, with tuned down gear and bosses that will lead guilds that have cleared Naxx. If that works out maybe a unfinished zone that will be patched. Keep talking to the community, learn from mistakes each patch and just add fun and epic quests. 1 Horde zone 1 ally zone and a combined one filled with outdoor group content.
---
Grim Batol rework that fits vanilla style raiding. Maybe we need an Uldum Patch first. 
---
3rd year Add Blood Elves, Draenei and other races but don’t give each faction a shaman or paladin. Time to level once more! With new starting areas with slight different stories. Never make a shared city we need to kill each other on sight and not get used to be inline if sight of the enemy
---
Cavern of times can host different Hall of Fame raids for seasonal patches not to drop gear that is superior to what drops elsewhere but just a vanilla raid of an event played out in other expansions.  High skill ceiling not so great gear, just for a certain color theme on existing tiersets 
---
Let’s first make this 24 months a success, I know Blizz employees left, but the once who are currently working at blizzard, where once true fans of the same vanilla as we did. I think it can be a success, although I left Blizzard a while back.... 
---
I hope this could be a turning point a lesson for many developers to take matters into their own hands and stop the destructive path they walked down to with Cashshops and MTX. 
---
We also need to make this a success to prove that we are right. Make this game a success for 2 years and that will give us enough insight if all that I am preposing is the right path to follow.
---
Hatebeard going to main a troll shaman! 
---
FOR THE HORDE!!
---
It’s only been this way since they added paid transfer. 
---
I'm going to implement time zone with no doubt, I'm currently working 8hs and studying another 4hs so I'm gonna use it myself too haha
---
With your concern of people ninja looting something to sell it back, I would be shocked if anyone actually purchased it back. If someone ninjad an item, they would be kicked and they can keep it. Flame them on forums and the community and move on. The odds of this happening would likely be minimal nonetheless. 
---
I see your concern though, I just don’t agree that loot trading gives MORE incentive to ninja loot an item, 99.8% of the time you won’t have a ninja looter. Then 99.8% of the time IF one happens, he would be kicked, not bartered with I would imagine.

Ammo is very very cheap, you'd spend more money levelling up arcane shot than on ammo. Losing a bag is annoying however.

Got to PUG a little bit of Naxx but didn't get very far and mostly PvPed, including WPvP, and that was after 2006 because I didn't even start playing till end of 2005! It was a good run and it will be nice to have some certainty that I will get to enjoy more of the game than I had been able to before. Won't get bogged down making alts until I am a bit more invested in my main this time around. I managed to level a Paladin to 51 and a Druid to 42. Both great classes as well... Clearly I had a bias towards hybrid classes, not certain if the same inclination will befall me this year, but we shall see.
---
Good old zerker stance. I miss thee.
---
Thanks! I'll try my best to do a website thinking in the community. Is more a project of mine so it will free and with no ads.
---
I'm gonna check it out! Ty for the info
---
Yes, they took over. now its a place for ppl with a general wow forums mentality. it feels very similar to that place here.
---
Also to put it blatantly, most ppl here never fully experienced vanilla recently (only possible by playing on ps). and you cant really rely on memory from 12 years ago judging these things.
---
If you played extensively on ps, and its all vibrant in your brain, you'd have a different perspective on things, than these naive guys.  Cos you'd know how it would affect the game in all the aspects, and how terrible it'd be.
---
I'll do indeed, thanks!
---
&gt; The main reason being that it would affect the economy. Gold per hour from farming, especially as an AOE class (thinking DM farming) would be quite a bit higher.
---
I have never seen proof of this and personally I think it's highly unlikely. 
---
The constraints on AoE farming in the overworld are other people and respawn time - in real vanilla, as opposed to pirate servers, respawn took so long there is nowhere you could constantly AoE at maximum throughput, even if you had the place to yourself.
---
The constraint on AoE farming in instances is that you can only reset the instance so many times per hour.
---
Either way all that will happen if you make looting AoE kills faster is that AoE farmers spend more time waiting for respawn or a new instance and less time repetitively clicking on mobs.
---
I hope Classic is great. I mean, I will try and get a character to top level to have at least one alt who never gets less powerful two years in, but I do fear that it may not appeal to the modern gamer as much as it did back in the day. I don't think it will be as appealing to play all day/night/week long as it did back in the day, but it will still be good. 
---
I will save you the trouble:
---
Skip it. Don't go there. Just don't. 
---
You are welcome. 
---
If you're a horde warrior I'd at least recommend doing the first bosses, that helmet and shield are way too useful to pass up. 
---
Or hope the dungeon dropped enough cheese and water to keep the healer and tank topped off, else the pulls would be as small as possible and really lengthy between.
---
My buddy (pally tank) and I (priest healer) made plenty of jokes about "cheese off the floor" while running through Deadmines and Scarlett Halls. I'd buy a stack of water beforehand some days, and after that ran out between us we looked to RNGeesus to provide.
---
it probably wouldn't be that hard to find a casual guild where being spec'd that way was alright, just getting the 40 player count for the first two tiers with people who show up consistantly will be the main goal. 
---
Note that nobody has told you the exact mechanics.
---
Because nobody knows the exact mechanics yet.
---
But all the Chicken Little's predicting the end of the world are assuming, with no sane basis, that you will be able to trade loot you acquired with a Need roll.
---
This is NOT how it was in the most recent live, retail version of loot trading. In that version you could only trade loot you acquired from master loot or a Greed roll.
---
Note that all the abuses people are scaring themselves over, like people rolling Need against you for a desirable item and holding it for ransom, or rolling Need against you for a desirable item and trading it to a friend, cannot happen if you cannot trade loot you got with a Need roll.
---
Why was it that way in retail? Because that exact stuff happened and Blizzard learned from it. So are they going to implement the abusable version everyone hated again? Very unlikely. Certainly not worth wetting yourself over at this stage until it is confirmed somehow.
---
Absolutely. Which is why blizzard has always had the policy of: is what you are doing giving you an unfair advantage? If so, then you will be getting some degree of punishment. With that said, within a few weeks of launch, some morons will find an exploit and make use of it and stupidly post it all on social media. Then, they will be banned. I think Blizzard will crack down hard on the first people who do this to send a clear message. 
---
I'm in a similar situation. I've only technically played Vanilla, my highest level character was mid 30s when patch 2.0 dropped. I did however get a rogue to 60 on a private server and did some casual raiding up to BWL.
---
I played a Troll Hunter , got to Level 44 
---
Didn’t have the friends or guild to really get past that point since that’s when I started getting ganked a lot by level +50 and maxed Toons whenever I tried leveling/grinding 
---
&gt;some morons will find an exploit and make use of it and stupidly post it all on social media
---
Morons? Devs want people to actively search for and share exploits, they get fixed much faster that way.
---
Did you ever play vanilla wow? Players got infamous really quickly and weren't invited. There's not a ton of idiots per server. You can't compare private servers to the actual vanilla experience. It's not the same. 
---
There wasn't spec specific gear; the gear was meant to have a real "versatility" feel to it, basically, to enhance abilities from all trees. Most classes were meant to have specs that comprised of 20/31, so 40 % of your points would be in the other skill tree. If you were into mini-maxing, you'd try to swap some pieces of gear with raid gear pieces and vise-versa. 
---
Ehh, Maybe in early levels ammo is cheap, but at 60 it’s 48s to however much people are charging for the top end crafted shots, and ammo goes quick, maybe not a major money sink, but it does add a big expense 
---
Or is it tragic because it's a little too real?
---
I call them morons because they will clearly be exploiting the game for their own benefit and then be dumb enough to post a video about it. 
---
For all you people out there who find and report potential exploits, I'm grateful and you have my respect!
---
What about a sealed vanilla box, non-CE?
---
I'm not fearing anything, nor whining about anything. Were you whining in your post?
---
Exactly as you said and as I said, I will find them funny. And yes if it may happen, it will only be from an individual in particular, most likely. But of course if I know most people or even the GM behave like this in a certain, I won't stay in that guild for long anyway, because I don't think that way.
---
And I answered mainly because, while I think both cases will be rare, I've literally never seen anyone talking about yours in reddit or back in the day. That's all.
---
I would lie to enter such a guild so that I could experience the first time through them. 
---
Wheres your original main from 2004? Not even blizzard servers are forever.
---
if it's what you want to play then play it. I'm not sure as many people are rolling undead as people think. everyone I talk to is going Orc for stun resist lol
---
If you're not aiming to be the top 1% of pvpers, no.
---
Also keep in mind that this general idea that alliance warlocks are bad because of WotF means that those people who do roll alliance warlocks have less competition on that gear.
---
Sometime late in the summer of 2005 I made my first push for level 60. I was playing a gnome mage, and was really pvp oriented. I had watched pvp videos of mages the past weeks, and had probably spent 100 hours in WSG while leveling (I remember WSG was released when I was lvl 41).
---
So I'm lvl 59 grinding on the moonkin mobs up in winterspring. Naturally I had recently installed Fraps to record some crazy WSG plays to make the best mage pvp movie ever made. I see I am only a couple of kills away from 60, so I turn on my recording to get the big moment on film.
---
As I engage another mob a rogue ambushes me. I blink, and fight the rogue while tanking the moonkin mob. When the rogue comes in range I frost nova him and the npc. I spam my arcane explosions to finish off the rogue (I had 5/5 talent points specced to make arcane explosion instant cast, which it wasn't baseline back then.) at this point my hp is low, and mana depleted. I'm down to approx 5 % life and mana and the rogue is out of my nova. Just as I cast the last arcane explosion my mana can produce.. DING!! I instantly get full hp and mana. The rogue died after another explosion or two. I had just recorded my first character dinging lvl 60 (21 days played, mind you) while (in my mind) owning a ganking rogue in extreme style.
---
While looking through my old recordings and screenshots a couple of years ago I stumbled across this particular Fraps clip. It was basically 3 frames per second and so blurry you could hardly make out what was going on. Sadly I lost this and most of my old stuff on a hard drive somewhere since then. This is still probably the moment I remember most vividly. 
---
For 5 mans you don't need the absolute best in raw healing or efficiency. Depending on faction, go either paladin or shaman, the buffs they provide are just too good. Resto shaman are highly sought after in raids as their buffs are group only.
---
Wheres your original main from vanilla? Gone? Thought blizzard was 4ever?
---
God, warlocks are such cancer. That video made me cry for the paladin.
---
The only DPS class not expected to DPS.
---
Yep
---
This was, iirc, December 2004. Maybe January 2005.
---
the biggest joy of a healer in dungeon are deadly pulls where you let the worst dps die intentionally cuz you know every point of mana wasted on him is 5times more valueable on other people
---
dm east ghost part is a good spot for such things
---
This actually made me chuckle because it is so accurate 
---
Don’t get me wrong, they’re some of the cooler pets for sure. I would’ve kept it if it wasn’t for wanting a house and hard times. I regret getting rid of it, but hopefully it made someone else happy. 
---
As a German native: It is definitely a translation thing. The sentence is "Wir sind sehr zuversichtlich, dass alle aktiven „WoW“-Abonnenten ab Sommer 2019 in „Classic“ unterwegs sein können.". 
---
One could awkwardly translate this as "We are very confident that all active WoW subscribers will be able to be out and about in "Classic" starting summer 2019."
---
The "out and about in" part is kind of awkward to translate. Basically the author just means "play the game", but uses slightly colorful language.
---
Don't worry about it.

4 hours a night wiping nonstop you get to red multiple times.  I blew 40+ on my Rogue quite often.  You gotta remember that most people were awful at this game in Classic, so wiping every 10 minutes was a thing.
---
is it a rethoric question? just think for a moment will it be noticable in pvp, that you have minus 1 ability?
---
btw enjoy shamans too. grounding, tremors, 5 seconds cd ranged interrupts all yours.
---
Some of the bugs became legendary for Vanilla users and actually broke up some of the monotony of the grind. I remember Alterac Valley and surrounding areas being unquestable for a while because my server had the NPC vampire bug which took them awhile to get under control. 
---
It effectively forced me to play other areas and explore and do different things in the game, which I was grateful for. 
---
Fite me
---
That was a translation mistake. "in Classic untwerwegs sein können" translates to "be able to travel/run around in classic" instead of travel to classic.
---
YouTube lies to me
---
Die more to murlocks with "imba" movementspeed and flame your chat bro.  2 min after you said you are very patient &lt;3.

Death Coil = a horror effect, not a fear. They WOTF then you Death Coil them, then re-fear. 
---
Alliance has better buffs for a Warlock, like Salvation for PvE.
---
The vanilla distance is from like 1999. 
---
the difference from retail is giant, if you take a break in Retail during a raid tier not only does everyone stop doing the raid completely when a new one is out but catch up mechanics invalidate the gear you had anyway and a fresh max level could be ahead of you in 2 days of playing 
---
Close, a $10,000 investment in AAPL on the day WoW was released (30th of Aug 2004) would've resulted in a net return of ~$768,000 dollars today (Jan 14th 2019), NVDA would've returned ~$730,000 at it's all time high from October of 2018 but it also would've given dividends so it might've been a better investgment.
---
hahahahaha I see what you did there
---
The PvP gear for paladin doesn't really have +healing on it. The epic set and the level 60 version of the blue set (which originally became available pretty late in vanilla) had spell power on it, which does give healing but not nearly as much as actual healing gear. The level 58 blue set just has physical stats and some intellect. Unfortunately, holy paladins get very little out of PvP gear unless you're going for a damage-dealing holy spec which, while possible, is not very mainstream.
---
Dam. Yea I guess when you are like learning the BWL for the first time for 40 people fresh it can be like that. But I mean I started on private servers and knew nothing and we never even came close to that level of failure. I think that with the encounters being known for 15+ years, you aren't going to wipe quite that much when youre doing progression.
---
in both situations you will find yourself noticeably  behind but in Vanilla much of your progress is more permanent, some enchants, patterns and recipes you've collected stay relevant, some Items even stay BiS or close to it through all tiers (like lion hearts helm I believe) things just have a better lasting value
