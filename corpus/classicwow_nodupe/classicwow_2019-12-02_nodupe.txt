Oh right, we could totally fight a boss while the healer ran out of mana on rats. Gotcha. I’ll be sure to take your opinion into consideration, never.
---
---
---
Are you really saying people don't funnel their MT when tank threat determines how much the dps can pump lol?? The quality of your mitigation pieces determines how much TPS gear you can wear. You always gear MT first.
---
[removed]
---
All addons communicate via chat channels, how do you think dps and threat meters work? They sync their data.
---
Hey if you're good with development, I've been playing with this idea and you are free to have it. What if we had an add-on where you rated people you pugged with (could even have categories like politeness, player skill, etc) so you could see who's worth pugging with and who's just wasting your time?
---
I won’t heal a Lock if I don’t see him at least attempt to bandage or eat once.
---
yea, im not giving you 6 stacks of water for 30s. im not asking for 6g for 6 stacks but be reasonable.
---
Think I got it at 30. Arena was empty when chest spawned so I yoinked it.
---
Yes, it was if you played on any of the launch PvP servers which were just as overcrowded as these were, the added servers were not as bad because they were not overcrowded, but the launch servers were really bad.  I literally only could log onto my alts to level them late at night because of how many times you would get ganked meant progression during primetime was impossible.    I played on a PvP server at launch which is exactly why I choose to do a PvE server for this because I remember how shit the experience was, especially once they added honor to the game.
---
fiery is around 20g on my server 0.o is it that cheap on yours?
---
Tank as either Arms or Prot. Fury is not great for tanking 5 mans.
---

---
**As Prot:** 
---
1. Equip 1h + shield. 
---
2. Berserker rage before pull
---
3. Battle stance + charge macro 
---
4. Defensive stance + shield slam macro 
---
5. Demo shout 
---
6. Switch targets and do one sunder on everything while using shield slam / revenge on CD
---
7. Spend extra rage on Cleave
---
**As Arms:** 
---
1. Equip 2h. 
---
2. Tell people to chill with DPS until after first whirlwind. 
---
3. Berserker rage before pull
---
4. Battle stance + charge macro 
---
5. Rage pot if you don't have 30 rage
---
6. Sweeping strikes 
---
7. Berserker stance + whirlwind macro 
---
8. Defensive stance 
---
9. Demo shout 
---
10. Sunder on all targets, use whirlwind macro / revenge on CD 
---
11. Spend extra rage on Cleave
---
12. Battle stance and pool rage for next pack when the mobs are close to dying so you don't have to rage pot.
---
Where the fuck do I say that? I say, kill spider boss FIRST and skip the gate part totally.
---
Can you not read?
---
600 dps with "few epics?"
---
Are these people playing Warrior and just so happen to have Viskag and Brut Blade/CHT and Edgemaster's as their "few epics" and are fully loaded to bare with every possible consumable buff they can get? Because hot damn, most people are NOT doing that much in mostly blue gear.
---
I scored a 97th percentile at 508 dps as a mage on Rag 2 weeks ago, and I already have 6 epics with every enchant I can get. No way 600 dps is common with "few epics" on any other fight that isn't a turret tank n spank boss.
---
Even if it's true, it is Blizzard who *allowed* an addon to lag their game. Don't blame an addon for Blizzard's fault.
---
By literally reading the lua code on the addon and seeing that it's making a shitload of queries per second.
---
No one really knows.
---
There's a lot of speculation because when Vanilla came out no one ever 'saved up' twink items, you'd either use them or sell them on the AH for a few gold as you leveled since there was no real interest in it prior to BG's.
---
Nowadays I've seen screenshots of peoples banks filled with twink items, enchants and other consumables perfect for low brackets so I imagine that the supply is significantly higher than it was in vanilla when BG's initially came out. 
---
I think that twink items will still be worth quite a lot (relative to their actual level), but I figure that when BG's come out and people start making twinks more consistently, you'll see a lot of the people that stockpiled them start to release them to the AH so that they may not be as crazy prices as some people expect. 
---
We'll just have to wait and see though, who knows how many people have actually bothered leveling twinks and kitting them out at this point.
---
That streamer tho, who even watches that crap?
---
You'll never find a horde alone on firemaw but this dude really tops the leaderboard of bad players i've seen seen so far
---
Assuming you're going to gear as dps you can do what I did.
---
Upon reaching 60 I stayed as arms in my leveling spec for quite some time until I got gear for fury. So, I recommend learning BRD and tanking it for the Savage Gladiator Chain and HoJ. The 2h axe from Emperor is also a good pick up until you get your Dal'Rends. You will also get a chest piece from 7 dwarves until the Savage Gladiator Chain drops. 
---
While I was spamming BRD I was also doing LBRS and especially UBRS (as dps, arms is great for dungeons) whenever possible, all these dungeons are close to eachother. I did this to pick up True Strike Shoulders, Dal'Rends, Valor Shoulders and the bracers. You only need to do Jed/Rend runs for this. Last boss also drops a good shield and a ring I recommend.
---
If you don't want to tank and you can scan world chat from time to time and look for people who need dps for strat live/ud aswell for Mask of the Unforgiven and Cape of the Black Baron.
---
Upon getting enough hit and both dalrends, I switched to fury.
---
I saved all my money for Lionheart helmet but wether you buy that or 100% mount is up to you. I recommend buying the Devilsaur Set first though. Gl and hf.
---
Yeah I've heard people get 24hr - 48hr bands for cross faction communication, one guy was raging here last week and missing the point he kept saying blizz were weak because whatever he said was not even abusive but the ban is just cross faction chat in general.
---
But also see a lot of people who don't get banned likely because not many people would bother reporting someone for saying "i am georgio armani" after killing them.
---
I think the exact opposite ... worst offenders are human males
---
[deleted]
---
If we cannot kill rats, and the healer runs out of mana quick on small pulls,  then even if we teleported straight to a boss and fought them, how exactly would we win a harder fight that lasts longer...?
---
I’m just not even interested in spending time replying or reading your comments, move along.
---
It is. If you run Adblock and leave the site up for an hour, there’ll be like 4000 ads blocked
---
Frost while leveling
---
I second this. Dwarves are why i play Alliance, IF is the coolest thing sense ice, and its a MMO i want to be hero not a villain....plus i hate goth kids (rich spoiled brats that complain how horrible their life is while they spend $100 bucks at rite aide so they can look pale)...goth kids play horde fyi
---
I can understand falling for well crafted phishing attempts. Everyone is only human and some of these things look so lifelike you really need to sit down for a minute to spot the differences - easy to miss in a hurry or with life going on in the background.
---
Falling for a guy named Blizzards telling you to visit usa-warcraft is peak Darwinism and probably doing your future group- and guildmates a favor.
---
Classic aura
---
that was only when he was between the FP and the outside of BRM. It wouldn't matter if he stealthed the whole way to the entrance as there was 90 fucking horde in there dude. He clearly also wanted to gank the rogue who makes so many peoples lives miserable.
---
If you play 100+ hours a week, you’re absolutely a no-life loser.
---
Honorspy is bordering on cheating? or just spy?
---
PvE racials? Access to EK?
---
I really want to roll conflag for some fun pvp since Ive found that most of the end game activities in classic wow to be actually fairly boring. I have 3 T1 fel pieces and about 200 SP. I want to get advice on if I should really wait to get more gear before this is a good idea or not. Will I just get stomped if I try now? I’m also playing with ~250 ms ping (but I can’t choose another server now so oh well). 
---
Getting new gear in end game is actually incredibly time consuming between finding groups to run things, farm things, and traveling. I’m a lock which makes it a bit faster with summoning, but I find that it’s nearly impossible for it to be like “I have 2 hrs right now lemme take a dice roll on X dungeon boss for Y gear upgrade”. It doesn’t seem to be possible to do much of anything towards actual gear upgrades in a play session under 2 (even 3) hrs, outside of raiding (which has weekly lockouts). 
---
This more or less turned into a bit of a rant. I guess I’m just having less fun with the way the game works at end game grind, but I’m still very addicted to the game and can’t bring myself to quit since I haven’t reached my goal of having fun pvping (at least at a marginally decent level).
---
To me, the final end game goal of classic wow is pvp with the sick gear you’ve spent months grinding/leveling for. I don’t need to be the absolute best I just wanna enjoy the fruits of my labor to satiate my wow goals I’ve had since my mom made me quit vanilla wow back in 2005 at age 11 forcing me to part ways with that lvl 32 warlock.
---
Most threat-meters aren't auto-inspecting *everyone* you see and then sharing that data with *everyone* using the addon on your entire server.
---
You have the option not to get ganked a million times and you dont take it because you want to read the text of boring fetch quests.
---
I'm genuinely curious and not trying to be a dick...but why are you flagged in your own city?
---
As an Alliance-Stalagg player, this video made me jealous. I wish it was half this easy to get to BRD on my server.
---
pretty sure mine was in the first few mobs
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
perhaps repayment for some of the terrible drop rates ive had elsewhere
---
The big Alliance guilds on those servers should organize now to hold AQ hostage
---
Maybe you just take too much damage. And you jumped straight into rat parts without doing any bosses? Okido, nice lie.
---
Shit, I'd get one if it was guarunteed to last 600k miles
---
You really think twink item values will crash when BG's relesae? i would of thought it'd increase?
---
Thos is why I've been saying killing someone 20 or 30 levels below you should be a dhk
---
spy need to get BAN, but do not touch the combatlog anymore. they did the 50 yards, now you got so many addons sending info over chat channels it breaks the chat server.   
---
i would say set it back to 200, ban spy somehow, limit the ability for addons to send message over hidden channels.
---
Hmm, I get shit for being fury prot. "What do you mean you're not full prot for 5 mans? How are you going to hold any aggro?!"
---
Lol need to toughen up buttercup. Its pvp game find guildies who wanna enjoy the slaughter, again coming from a hardcore ally on Sekrem. No changes I love how my server is!!
---
I even still see 1980's model Camrys still running, 30 years later.
---
?
---
The horde are just dis proportioned humans too though?
---
Lmao this will be such a shitshow. Imagine people griefing this 24/7 doing whatever they can to prevent other guilds from getting the tag to increase their odds on "world first BWL"
---
&gt;  as an addon that allows you to play with your brain turned off
---
The addon can't control your character. The addon can't make you do the mechanics properly. Literally all it does it show ability timers for the boss. That is not "playing with your brain turned off".
---
Yall always whining about this, yet on Incendius it feels like this for horde.
---
People wanted#Nochanges and the OG classic feel. Isn’t this it?
---
Well, he must be making the rounds. I got a whisper from him on Arcanite Reaper.
---
Hi mate,
---
I've been doing duo runs with my mage friend.
---
You can almost duo anything. We've done DM:T, DM:N, DM:E, strat living , lbrs , ubrs (up to first boss but you can go further if you get help summoning the boss) and parts of Strat UD.
---
You can also go farm sinews and eye of shadow, but those are quite rng. Living for orbs or east for herbs/mining is better gph.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Sorry but, we had multiple layers; each with a healthy vanilla population. Let’s say 2.5k is vanilla. And let’s say 4 layers for examples sake. That’s 10k people on the server at one time. With large queue times.
---
Then they drop to one single layer. So 10k people on one layer? Or they keep it at only 2.5k across the server? Which would mean HUGE queue times? Or it’s somewhere in between?
---
What do you think is more likely?
---
What does it feel like to you?
---
Because everyone seems to feel like there is far more people than before.
---
male orc rogue combat animations are horrible
---
tell me what the point is of stamina and int while leveling? with maximum efficiency you are never full hp or mana as a lock anyway. the only stats that matter is spirit and shadow damage
---
Shit exp compared to SM though and people are on their 2nd or 3rd toon by now. I think it gets an appropriate amount of love
---
Every damn time. I'll wait to bandage, I'll bandage immediately, I'll bandage during the fight. No matter what, I always get a heal immediately after I start bandaging.
---
Well, that is on you, that is how Warlocks function and they get way more mana back life tapping than it costs you to heal them. Hellfire is one of the best AOE spells in the game as long as he doesn't have aggro or the talent to reduce pushback with a Paladin's Conc Aura.  
---
  
---
If you're going to heal in Classic, just remember the Warlocks aren't doing this to fuck you. If you're a Priest a single Renew kept rolling on them is more than enough to sustain them.
---
I’m on a horde on a horde dominated server and we have ally rogue squad in undercity, every zepelin, most graveyard and in front of orgri. They kill straggler while most people just ignore them, building a group to kill them is a waste of time, you kill a few and they scatter and you can’t tracK them. So you just wait to be out of pvp when going through the less populated area, and watch pvp tagged people get murder and rage after you not doing anything (I’m not charging into 5+ rogue)
---
Just rogue things, they have a uinteractive mechanic so they can pretty much do whatever they want
---
For me personally I like to use void when I (used to ) grind mobs in the open world. It not great at holding aggro but it holds it just a little bit longer than the succubus. 
---
In dungeons I use my imp for Stam boost for the group. He does decent damage as well. 
---
Lvl53 alt lock
---
I never had it, and still servers goes down for me
---
I play a rogue and this just made me sick to my stomach lol.
---
99 percent of warlocks are good with tap. The others usually die alot
---
What? No... Tell me more.
---
Imagine crying and insulting people because of a game. You must've gotten real far in life if this gets you so riled up.
---
Thanks for your honor mate.
---
And these TOS cannot be enforced. Nobody can force me to kill someone out in winterspring if I don't feel like it. If I don't want to kill people from a certain guild in the opposing faction, that's my right. If I want to kill a certain guild, race or class on sight that is also my right regardless of them being lvl 11 and worth zero honor. Trying to moderate these interactions is exactly the sort of thing that will lead to BFA-level community and game design.
---
For PvE I had a priest who was mind soothing his ass off one time. We were blowing through LBRS skipping a ton of packs and only pulling parts of other packs. Didn’t realize how strong mind soothe was before, knew it was good but not THAT good in terms of time management. Once you’re 60 doing gear runs mind soothe can be invaluable in speeding up a run. 
---
For PvP there’s a few things. Druids using abolish poison or shamans use poison cleanse totems is extremely powerful vs rogues. Blind = poison so it’s removable + the poisons are poisons ofc. For some reason I rarely see both these classes use those abilities to counter rogues
---
Why is there a 13 columns (from 1000 to 13000) of ranking points per week ? 
---
Shouldn't it be 14 ?
---
He has no honor.
---
Too much supply
---
Today i lost raid at Onyxia. I logged in largely in time, but since i was very far they could not summon me due to gankers and decided to clear her, at first try, for not waiting me.
---
It even dropped the t2 helmet.
---
I don't blame them, i don't want to hold hostage the time of 30 people, but damn if i am still salty.
---
You can have DKP with loot priority. They are not mutually exclusive. My guild has DKP but TOEP has mage/warlock prio.
---
I'll try to keep it simple. Essentially every time you return to the city from contested zone you will be flagged for PvP for a set amount of time. So everytime you port into, hearth into, or in some cases fly into IF you will be flagged. Horde rogues and druids take advantage of this window to gang up on unsuspecting victims in places like the Mystic ward (where people port in), the caverns (where rogues buy their poisons), and now near inns and the center of town.
---
In my case I hearthed in and stood near the mailbox outside the bank thinking I'd be safe to take a piss. Turns out I wasn't. But hey, it was my fault for even bothering to leave the city in the first place.
---
Is there a way to make it so that I don't swap stance if the Charge doesn't go off?
---
wow an intelligent comment on classicwow reddit
---
I'll try and do this slowly so you can follow. 
---
When you interject a commonly repeated line that appears here mostly as Horde delusion about queue times without any kind of further explanation, its logical to assume you too are handwashing the situation by citing crossrealm BGs, which likely won't alleviate the queues at all and could potentially make them even worse. 
---
Its not rocket surgery.
---
After arriving from a contested zone you are still flagged for 5 minutes. If you don’t engage in any PvP activity during these 5 minutes, you will be unflagged. Getting ganked counts as PvP activity, and resets the timer to 5 minutes.
---
The only people who like dkp are the ones who plan on hoarding it. Loot Council is far superior if your guild is even remotely in the 'hardcore' category.
---
Yes and no, depending on the system. Some guilds might use a percentage decay system (e.g. on a weekly or reset basis) to try to curb DKP hoarding a bit, and to encourage spending it on genuine upgrades rather than just honing in on one specific item.
---
Ban add-ons.
---
In testing, players have reported an *extra* 1mbps of bandwidth usage compared to when not using the addon. ([Link for source](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/honorspy#c133))   
---
During some of my own testing last night on Arugal (Oceanic) Horde, it was sending over 1300 messages PER SECOND.  
---
PER SECOND.
---
How so? I’m on a ally favoured server with a 30-70 ratio. Alliance is camping every 50+ zone. When a zone is getting camped you are not the only one in it. So others are getting camped as well. Also it’s usually 1-5 60s so they aren’t even in big forces (unless you play on a streamer server but then it’s on you). 
---
Res, run away. Regroup  and take the fp back. I have done this the past weekend 4-5 times. 
---
Now just because most people aren’t willing to spam general because “what would others think of me being so needy/annoying” it doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. We have managed to gather around 10-15 people each time. If nothing works just spam invite on the ghosts/players around you. Or all the people you see in /who. 
---
I know this sentence makes this subreddit shake in their boots, but “That’s just how pvp is”. You bet your ass after taking fp back at Un’Goro we have camped it ourselves for a solid 10-15 minutes. Just to get ride of the frustration when we were getting camped. 
---
I really don’t understand your point, in this argument. Yeah if you lazy or antisocial and not willing to go through the trouble, yeah I see the issue but that’s just on you. Grow a pair and you might as well enjoy the pvp lifestyle.
---
And if you find it annoying to spend extra time and resources on something you normally wouldn’t have to that just means you should have rolled on pve. 
---
That’s exactly what pve is for, for people who only have an hour or two a day to play, and instead of waisting it to fight the opposite faction they want to get some progress done. 
---
As much as people don’t like to hear it it’s the truth. It’s a “fucker’s game” as explained by Uberdanger, if you not addicted aka playing 6-8 hours a day (if you working and if a neet probably 12-18) you should have rolled pve. 
---
Play a bit of Rust and you will see what actual toxic game design is. You guys wouldn’t last a day in that game.
---
My bad for leaving the city in the first place. Next time I'll just log in and AFK in IF the entire time. Thanks for the advice man.
---
honorspy is not even close to as problematic as spy? what am i missing?
---
Servers been not working for 7 days basically. 
---
Some random GM replied in one thread saying they are looking into it like 2 days ago.
---
Flabbbbberz
---
Only Sith deal in absolutes.
---
No, if it was an occasional occurrence, sure, but all day everyday in almost every zone? Not Vanilla experience.
---
I agree, it is a service at that point. Just any service, the person uses their time and skill to do "work" for you in exchange for compensation.
---
If I don't need to do that dungeon, but you do, and it is gonna take me 45 minutes, why would it be wrong to ask for compensation?
---
I (rogue) almost lost HoJ to a pally healer.
---
Is it legal (ToS) to camp Qia for recipes and spam interact +  a macro? Can you get banned for this?
---
you got 0 clue wtf you talking about. if your just looking on honorspy its sometimes takes last week honor, all b1 guys is just playing 16/h aday making 2-6k honor/hour, all horde hate us :D
---
Coming from Sekram alliance player, I support this and love the pvp all over. That is why I play daily for all things like this
---
I play a healer (priest) and a lock. I always heal life tap, it's just so much more efficient and quicker. But on my warlock I was told twice "you did the damage to yourself heal it yourself you have drain life".
---
I don't make/support blacklists or the trade chat rumor mill. I like to believe that people change over time, and that lack of knowledge will be resolved. And that the people who stubbornly refuse to learn will get bored and leave very quick. But holy fuck those moments really make me reconsider my stance.
---
For the same reason you are saying that you don't have to kill someone, blizzard can throw out a ban hammer for any reason they want.  You don't have to break the TOS to get a suspension or a ban lol, they can fit anything in to the glitching/exploiting clause.
---
EDIT:  I am not saying you are right or wrong.... I am just saying your argument is basically invalid.
---
we had 1 do 71k in 1day. its just about leeching right, and doing a great job.
---
I’m a lock. What would I have to regret?
---
I had issues with getting it to stay for a while. Then one day it worked. The options in the menu and the command seem bugged.
---
safer towns, better world pvp racials, safer transport, etc
---
This sub has a hate boner for LC but it is the superior system if your leaders are fair.
---
I do this a lot. If I run a dungeon with a good healer I'll tell them to add me as friends. It's an awesome perk to be able to instantly form a group at any time. Took about 4 minutes to form a Scholo group at 8 AM today.
---
There isn't much reason to do more than one run if you finish quests. Most low level dungeons don't get much love.
---
i mean 'looting last' isn't a use of the dkp system, it's more loot council
---
On my server there's no such thing as first orb to tank or paying for services.
---
The result is that I only tank for guildies and spend my time picking flowers and fishing to afford consumables for raids.
---
The randoms shout for tanks for hours. Sometimes they disband, sometimes they find an inexperienced tank who needs the dungeon for quests.
---
I know I'd be met with the kind of hostility that OP is displaying if I suggested payment so I just tell people that I'm busy picking flowers and don't need anything from dungeons.
---
&gt; "its there, i swear, just trust me"
---
I never said that.
---
You, on the other hand, are hiding behind "WELL PROVE IT, WELL PROVE IT, WELL PROVE IT SHOW ME THE ACTUAL PROOF, NO, WORDS AREN'T ENOUGH", because apparently everyone in this thread who is saying the same as me is lying.
---
10/10 troll got me to reply
---
Weak auras?
---
&gt; is Classic the Vanilla experience or not? 
---
On PvP servers no, definitely not. Server population caps are at least double what they were in vanilla which makes the game near unplayable during leveling. Even for the dominant faction.
---
That said if you roll on a PvE server it's very close to vanilla. I'm a bit salty about having to toss all that played time because Blizz fucked up so bad but it's still very fun.
---
Ahh but if I dont heal the lock they flip out lol
---
"can't play at optimal hours? guess you don't get to level!" - what you're saying
---
I went to Mirage Raceway EU from shazzrah and the amount of people lvling is staggering. I guess its a combo of refugees and alts but Still.
---
youre on heartseeker? horde are just the easier faction, so even when theyre at a disadvantage, its still not as bad. consider zep vs boats, consider guards of kargath (lots of 55s) vs morgans vigil (none). consider chillwind camp (unprotected/contested zone) vs bulwark (horde territory). 
---
if alliance are the smaller pop, which is true for every pvp server but 1, its just not the same game horde is playing, even on heartseeker.
---
edit: and i know you dont have it as bad because you said its being camped by a few 60s. on my server - not even a streamer server or anything wildly famous for imbalances, its never camped by anything less than 10 level 60s, and usually far more. its simply not possible to win a fight unless an ally raid comes through, and that only lasts for a few minutes.
---
also love the jab at not lasting a day in rust. ive played it. i know what im getting into with it. I expect a reasonable balance, but horde have tons of advantages AND the faction pop advantage. if it was one or the other, np. also its in blizzards interest to fix this, because lots of alliance have quit, and not because they are "soft" its because they literally are unable to play the game.
---
Everyone *deserves* to charge for a service. This isn't a morality question.
---
Zf and sm get all the love in my experience so far.
---
I rolled PVP because of the "classic experience" but PVP is not that fun... BGs are way better than world PVP because skill matters, not numbers and I can wait to get my fill of PVP till then. I just raidlog on my PVP toon and play mainly on PVE now
---
We've had addons that tell you how to complete every boss encounter in real time for like 14 years but now an addon tells you if you'll rank up and it's cheating?
---
Okay, apparently nobody scrolls up to the parent comments. Whatever.
---
Access to deviate delights is really what makes horde OP.
---
They don't roll for the same shit either! DPS Warriors are in leather for the most part.
---
This actually isn't true. In Vanilla it was, but since then the ToS has changed and cross faction collusion is no longer forbidden.
---
Server pops are much much highet in classic servers
---
I'm mostly agreeing with your comment. People complain about tank shortage but don't befriend warriors and druids. My friend helped me farm prebis so I help him farm DM for Lionheart. That type of stuff is what makes the game fun
---
Get engi/mining if you plan to be competitive in PvP at all. 
---
Enchanting is good if you ever need to move to a new guild. Tailoring is meh, maybe make a few of the cheaper blues for a friend or an alt but that’s about it.
---
😢 She was only 82
---
I died 117 times today on my 54 hunter. Yes 117 times. Im not saying horde players are angels here but they are much worse in a somewhat focused pvp scene. Like lamb to the slaughter. But the absolute worst are those who feed on the expers who dies in 2-3 rounds and gets kille 20 times over until they log. If you step one inch into WPL there is a fkin row if 5-10 rogues. A wall if you like. You wont live 5 seconds coming from undercity entering WPL. I understand the blackrock fights its pretty cool actually to have a constant battle. But the exp farming griefers gtfo or atleast give up after your 3 ”honor” kills.
---
No, you can still level just fine in other areas. I just did a couple of levels in Mirage Raceway/Desolace without any pvp besides the pvp I initiated.
---
Not talking about Honorspy
---
35ish. Now I have like 10 in my bank at 55.
---
So most but not all advantages?
---
I would legitimately appreciate if you could point out the section in the current ToS that forbids cross faction collusion.
---
Unless they gank you before you become automatically unflagged due to being in a safe zone. Being ganked counts as a pvp interaction and the timer will be reset.
---
I would bring more than that i like to have 30 minium go to northern ferals by the twin colossus lots of lvl 48 mobs around. For locks bring health pots, mana pots, greater arcane elixir, shadow power elixir, fire protection potions and a couple greater fire protection potions for rag. Bandages, food and drink buffs are great as well. If your gunna drop big cash on consums make sure your ina group with other people that are as well other wise it just turns into a waste of gold. What server are you on my friend? If your on grobbulus I can help you out some more (:
---
Edit: also one other add on you should have for raiding is deadly boss mods
---
Yes swimming form travel across the world, dps form go see a trainer...
---
That's totally allowed as long as you're actually at your keyboard manually spamming your macro.
---
The servers are also much larger, so the sheer amount of horde on servers with lopsided ratios is that much worse.
---
It really is some of the shittiest behavior in an online "community" ive ever seen.
---
Yeah. They can; and they'd lose a shitload of their players if they did it on a frequent basis.
---
According to the ToS you don't have a right to anything and they can ban you just for existing. According to ToS playing the game is you agreeing to no longer playing the game for any reason they decide. So yes, this could be a reason to be banned under ToS, because it's such a blanket "you're at the mercy of us" document.
---
Now if you want an actual answer: It's a grey area, but it's generally seen as against the rules.
---
Officially, it should never happen. It's why Forsaken started off knowing Common (as in lore, they were humans before being scourged) and had it taken away. Just a lot of insults and sleazy colluding behavior.
---
That being said, sometimes people make alts on the other faction, go to the other faction's major city, and spy on chat, reporting back about any plans to raid. That's generally allowed and approved of. And in general it's not like we can say "you can't talk to anyone of the other faction outside the game" that would be insane.
---
But wide scale cooperation against others of your faction is pretty dirty. And blizz previously warned people about the roofing exploits, which basically sets the precedent "just because you can doesn't mean you should". So it's safe to say it is against the rules and could get bans if Blizz actually takes a look at it.
---
Please tell me you don't honestly think at least some of us haven't tried. Personally I've been met with complete silence when trying.
---
This is amazing. I’m not even a warlock and this is one of the best tips I’ve heard of in WoW. I’ll keep this in mind Incase I ever join the dark side.
---
couldnt think of anymore relevant dialogue. I was going to have the healer cast fear ward as he was charging the lock, but thats as far as i got.
---
You literally are agreeing with me.
---
Yep, same. I started calling it spite healing. It's like some healers don't want to be replaced by cloth.
---
What ?
---
They released the plan for classic and it didnt have bgs coming out early.
---
My man why would you say something so wrong.
---
Perhaps. But unless there is written in-game evidence of such a fact there's zero chance this will get anyone banned. Just PvP happening (or not happening) on a PvP server.
---
Remove the stupid as fuck orc stun racial, balance wotf a bit and see how many of the hardcore people reroll alliance.
---
It’s actually dumb how much of an advantage horde get in pvp. Not only do they have the best world layout (besides BRM) but they also have OP as hell racists to go with it. No wonder so many people went horde this time around.
---
Classic Aura Durations + Omni CC
---
I am on Faerlina unfortunately but I appreciate the offer &amp; the tips you’ve given me :)
---
The referenced user(not user*s*) doesn't explain their methods of measuring this increase. Their comment isn't very useful..  
---
And ok neat, 1,300 additional messages per second... That says absolutely nothing. We don't know anything about the chat systems capabilities or bottlenecks. '1,300' is an entirely arbitrary and useless number.
---
Paladins?
---
It's a lot easier to get that much on alliance Firemaw tho :D
---
For me it's getting another drink or taking a piss.
---

---
Well played Sir, well played... lmao

---
A better idea: invest more than some crumbs into decent servers. Cheapskate small indie dev please understand.
---
At that level, you just use the tame ability.  If it fails, try again.  It's not that hard.
---
Yeah Cobraks back, he’s got a YouTube channel, not streaming though. He uploads less frequently though, life’s busy
---
Ya destros a load of fun even with ~40% of my gear is shadow power specific so I imagine it’s even better with pure +spell dmg
---
SM/DS is really good for solo content like DM E runs
---
&gt; You guys thought that staying on these servers were a good idea. 
---
No, I didn't. It's the same everywhere.
---
How idiotic can you be to try and argue that people complaining about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4lgeu/honestly_how_can_anyone_say_this_is_okay/) are 'just whining'.
---
I mean, agi/str gear while it levels. Druids aren't weapon dependant though so they don't benefit a ton having money thrown at them.
---
Or both
---
If he has the talents for it, his life tap can convert HP to 20% more mana and bandaging you can do it in combat and it's faster than food or drinks. Plus I usually come out of a dungeon loaded with runecloth. I've never bought runecloth before, I've only ever used what drops and I life tap-bandage alot.
---
Youre going to get pvp flagged on a pvp server, its not a strawman
---
Thank you
---
And who is gonna tank of we are busy farming gold on our alts?
---
The 'trick' is to wake up at 3AM, experience only a few corpse hops as you head over to the instance portal and then log out so you'll be ready for the instance later in the day. But for real, Alliance on Stalagg is a struggle rn.
---
I must be out of the loop but is dark pact not a passive that you get from your imp anymore?
---
ye heard its hell for horde. only stuff i know is philosopher's stone give all honor to 1 warrior, like team 15-20 cc the person and let a warrior kill the target, but that should be fine.
---
Going to delete this thread. 
---
Thank you everybody for the input, I have a good idea of what to do now and what is reasonable or not. 
---
conclusion: not much we can do if we still have any pugs in the raid and that doesnt seem to be happening anytime soon, so after next week depending on what happens it might be time to migrate for me atleast. 1 mage left this morning also soo thats just another pug. 
---
Thank you everyone and good night
---
It’s like I said in the main post. There’s a bunch of Blizzard and Reddit posts about people’s experience with this drop, and something seems screwey with Blizzard’s PRNG. 
---
Drop rate alone doesn’t provide dick for accurate data. In this thread, multiple people claim to have seen multiple HoJ drops in their first 20 runs. The probability of seeing the drop in 10 runs is 33% and 20 runs is 55%.  So for those lucky people their actual drop rate was something like 30% chance compared to the measly 4% to get the trinket per run. Again, over 50% of current submissions.
---
Then for the rest of the unlucky people, if you don’t get it in 20 or less, the other majority of people end up going over 100 kills easily. Since 100+ contains potentially 100-300 kills, I expect there to be a clump of data there, and still need a lot more overall data, but it should be more evenly spread between 1-20 going upwards 100.
---
The only reason I bother accounting for phase is to determine if people in P1 were getting significantly more drops than P2, indicating a silent hotfix on item drop rate. 
---
If all this data was collected in Wowheads addon, and they had an analytics tab with graphs and all that, it’d be far more accurate and show more trends than what I’ll get out of a web form.
---
Be aware the gearing a mage in raid will be significantly harder than gearing a hunter in raiding.
---
Leveling is one thing, but if you're actually intending to play into endgame mage has *some* challenges associated.
---
So are you really saying I could get banned because I worked *with* an Alliance player to kill some demons last night instead of fighting him? Come on.
---
I'm not the person suggesting that so idk I would ask them. 
---
Though I'd argue if you are farming gold you arent tanking anyway.
---
Well then, thanks for the reply.
---
Attack of the knuckle dragging, mouth breathing, neckbearded horde again I see? Nothing new to see here folks.
---
The same people who are playing it now played it then, except they weren’t permanently locked into a flawed game because patches and updates were a guarantee. Nobody would’ve continued playing it if those issues had not been resolved because the community would’ve degraded to the point that we are currently observing on the vanilla servers. Your idea of how the game should be managed would only work if 100% of the player-base consisted of honest, friendly individuals who weren’t interested in ruining other people’s time. 
---
If you want the game to remain as-is then you’re very likely one of the people who is exploiting the game mechanics. There is simply no other justification for not wanting to iron out these issues. These issues are not simply annoying, they’re allowing players to behave in a way that is **breaking the game for others.**

In Vanilla, I played Alliance because my friends did. I got accustomed to beautiful leveling zones, cities, and armor that actually fit your character. At some point, I rolled a horde alt just to try it out. Gloomy leveling zones, armor that looks ridiculous, it's aesthetically much worse. However, horde players were friendly and would actually help me when ganked in PvP.
---
And so - in Classic I rolled Horde. Horde players still help me when I get ganked in PvP, and Alliance players still do not help each other. I am happy with my choice and the players I found to raid with.
---
Pservs don’t have the same chat throttling controls enabled retail chats do.
---
I understand the theory, but with the limited hit available in game right now, yes get what you can, but it's just as or more important to stack crit to provide the most uptime of Improved SB for your raid. Once tier 3 drops, hit capping is the priority, until you cap, overall raid dps is improved with a higher loading of crit vs hit.
---
Simply put crit &gt; hit for your raid until end of tier 2 beginning of tier 3. Hit &gt; crit for your personal dps.
---
The horde that do this are just destroying their server for short term gains.
---
But blizzard are to blame. They just aren't acting fast enough.
---
I have played on one of the most active PvP servers in Cyclone (EU) battlegroup in Vanilla. Things were nothing like they are now.
---
Well it depends on what you’re doing, obviously. If you’re megapulling everything, having the mage spring for rank 4 blizzard is probably okay.
---
Agree 100%.
---
Thats cause it is grob is amazing AND we got 50/50 sever balance on top of it
---
just googled it
---
that works, thx a lot!
---
Would say, don't use DKP then
---
And if you get gank it resets the pvp flag...
---
Okay, mate.  
---
I suspect no amount of proof would be enough to convince you.
---
Perds is only bis for rogues in this phase , the swords in bwl are much better. It's bis for tanks until AQ or thunderfury.
---
Sure , having a few dagger rogues makes it essier to gear, but daggers are not solely good fpr rogues, nor does it make sense to have many dagger rogues with swords being better for the rest of the game
---
Well said. Good point
---
Aside from money for skills and your mount, there's not really any must-haves while leveling. Druids aren't very gear-dependent.
---
1% more on everything else is still good, plus a ton of stam/int which are both really important in pvp
---
thats blood pact, its the stam buff. Dark Pact takes 200 mana from your pet and transfer it to you.
---
Did you skip math class?
---
Your presumption that only people camping flight paths care about honor is comical.  Really illustrates that you're just a salty boy who wants people who ganked you to suffer even if it means the game is broken.  Great attitude.  Your opinion is useless.
---
&gt; trading so much honor that you top the leaderboards
---
That's the thing. I'm not happy with what I'm seeing here, but this is the opposite of honor trading. They're actively *not* killing each other, so that they can all gank other horde/alliance more easily. It's super not cool and hella sad that they feel the need to do this, but an agreement between guilds of opposite factions to *not* kill each other isn't honor trading.
---
That being said, communication between factions using a 3rd party platform is something that has seen people banned in the past, so maybe they can catch them with that. If they just have a standing non-agression agreement, that's fine. If they're all in the same discord calling out information for the opposite faction? Banhammer. Banhammer banhammer banhammer.
---
Oh man this is **so** spot on it's insane! There's such a huge difference playing with a warlock who's careful with life taps vs an idiot who taps like  he's the center of the fucking universe or something
---
His tank probably sucks and can't build threat so they don't let their casters have the talisman.
---
oddly specific with the 1999 toyota corolla line...
---
hmm i Remember they banned a addon in ICC, but cant remember if they broke it or banned it, called AVR
---
edit: Also after WOD they did alot with the API to avoid addons that did so much as the WA/Exorsus raid tool in hellfire.
---
Edit 2: idk how spy work 100%, but remove the ability for API to search the combatlog for enemys that you're not in battle with.
---
That awkward moment when the feral druid pipes up that he needs Accuria - only for the loot council to pretend to hear and not laugh.
---
I mean, you can't say you weren't warned. People saw this coming from a mile away.
---
Btw bgs won't fix it.
---
Server balance on a PvE server doesn't make any difference. The biggest factor is player density and competing for resources.

Just enter through UBRS for the first week when it's a shit show. Skip the madness.

---
Colluding? In my guild it's open knowledge all tanks roll Lowest set dkp on the tank loot/tier.
---
We work with a ms&gt;os system and if we all had to wage war with each other over tier we'd all be dkp starved on stuff we actually know has competition from the dps like ragnaros girdle, weapons,....
---
Seriously, I get that it "fools" the mob but why tf does it fool my raid frame?
---
Just run group 1 and group 2 with separate dkp.
---
this is just anecdotal but the private server Lightbringer had about a 12k concurrent population, had 1 to 1 blizzlike war effort resource amounts, and only a somewhat slanted population and it still took like 3 or 4 weeks to finish opening the gates. There were literally dozens of scarab lords on both sides.
---
I would ordinarily say that what happened on private servers does not apply to classic but so far its played out almost identical to them minus QoL stuff like removal of ony buff CD.
---
just dont log in again until BGs and if it's still bad wait for paid xfers
---
fuck releveling but that's just my opinion
---
The server caps are much larger in classic, new hardware both oh client and server, and better game engine.
---
Ya I also just learned that BGs are going to be cross realm, which was something super lame they did in late vanilla. I'm feeling like i might be done.
---
Well, this is a WoW sub and a post about Warlocks in WoW though.

Warlocks literally have a top tier affliction talent called Shadow Mastery.

They're not going to redo daily calculations. They will use the data from those daily processes in the weeky process.
---
If I asked you to add 15000 numbers then add another number, would you start from the beginning again? Obviously not.
---
And we now have been assured the daily calculations were wrong.
---
There is empirical evidence of players losing standing 1 due to vanished honor.
---
Also, if honor was calculating correctly still, youd see players with better standing with less honor than someone with worse standing. (I.e. we'd see screenshots of people with for example Standing 1 and 200k honor and Standing 2 with 215k honor, where the Standing 1 player had a display issue with over 15k honor.)
---
This has not occurred.
---
The calculations so far have been wrong, guaranteed.
---
Absolutely not true. Any guild that has to use /roll is full of loot horny kids who have no mutual trust/respect for their fellow raiders - thus falling back on chance to absolve them of drama.
---
I feel like I’ve played way too much and I’m lvl 55. My two other friends that play are right around me, maybe a lvl or two higher. I just don’t understand how people leveled so quickly!
---
As someone who only gets to play maybe 2 hours a day. I just hit level 55 on my mage. I would quit the game if this was my gaming experience.  
---
Maybe they should have a new system that if the same player kills  you over 5 times in a 30 minute window (in the open world) they then get a dishonorable kill. As they are harassing/camping a player. 
---
Or if you've gotten killed so many times by players in the span of 10 minutes you can have 10 minutes of non flagged time I  a zone, to allow you to, you know, play the game.
---
&gt; No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.
---
Literally rule #3.
---
Lmao I saw him the other day at TP when I was on an alt. I was watching a movie so I just sat dead for a while and I swear to god he sat at TP FP for over an hour and killed two people (both honorless). Cannot imagine how that guy finds that fun
---
Most DKP or lootcouncil have a "loot hirachy" anyway - meleeweapons for melees before hunters, healer cloth first for priest - other healers after, ....
---
its just most effective for the raid as team. 
---
But there are also plenty of "items that nobody wants" or not really good in pve.
---
And if you can choose to not bet on randoms, and rather group with players (That aren't necessarily great mind you, but since they'll stick around, you and your guildies can learn how to get better together) who know the drill of their class and the place; it's just a safer bet.
---
It's a balance. If I'm low on mana and have to drink, the lock can tap until his hp/mana are similar and sit and eat/drink. I usually don't have a ton of time to top off because the tank is fucking off onto the next trash pack. If I'm at 80% mana, sure go a head and tap but there are times when tapping down to 15% health isn't ideal.
---
Blizzard fanboy detected.
---
Read my sibling response.
---
The calculations have been wrong. They said it directly in that post: there was a mismatch of time between a day ending and the next day starting.
---
It doesn't matter if the kills are still in a DB. The script wasn't looking at those timestamps and those weeks have already been processed.
---
for some reason i expected you to say "my kid shoved a crayon in MY ear" and i was like
---
Bannin addon and changing the api are very different. They changed the api to prevent the lfg addon for Classic. But the problem with spy is that it uses very common calls to the combat that would, if restricted, affect a lot of other addons.

Buy Greater Arcane Elixir/Flask of Supreme Power for 1/20g~ cheaper on weekends, then resell on raid night for a profit.

You are free to ignore people or say no. You are still a dick for quibbling that someone isn't giving you enough money for something you made out of thin air in a couple of seconds. 
---
I am valuing your time. You just didn't use any of it. Stop trying to make out like you went out of your way or that its some great hardship.
---
30s just to cast a spell a few times is more than fair and you are acting like you are being hard done by? Give me a fucking break. You are a dick.

Who cares if some1 with less dps gets the loot? Dps is never an issue in classic.

Why would you bother asking Reddit when you can just ask the GM/officers directly and get answer that isn't just speculation?...

As far as I know its be level 50ish

The horse turds are a bunch of losers who have no life. Shits lame yo.

I’m not saying Dalaran Lag was only due to GearScore, merely that GearScore seemed to exacerbate the issue.
---
Sigh. This is being done. The issue is overpopulation. Six horde on the Theramore boat can be wiped, but twenty more come. Meanwhile, calls are sent out for Red Ridge and dark shore and Everlook and Burning Steppes and TP etc. there are simply not enough players.
---
While you took back the boats for a while, rogues were all over org. 
---
It’s not just an issue of imbalance, it’s the sheer number of players AND imbalance that allow multiple targets at once.
---
I had a level 60 sheep my 24 warlock repeatedly, so their level 17 buddy could auto attack me to death.

Same issue with ret paladins - they give nothing that a holy pala can't, but they also want warrior/mage bis and do sub-tank dps.

Earthfury is now 60/40 ally favored.  It's a fucking nightmare for horde atm

As a newbie to WoW, what do I need to be ready for MC?

The only thing I can find out is getting your pre-bis which I have some(still working on others). Do I get a certain potions, X amount of potions, etc etc?

I'm a 60 dwarf rogue if that changes anything
---
I'd argue the opposite. Blizzard can limit these things and it's not the addon devs fault that he wrote the addon to be as good as possible and chats are lagging because Blizzard's servers aren't made for that amount of messages.

Everything you said applies to every role.

Sheeping heals you, is broken by damage and DRs
---
Unpopular opinion but it is most likely simply the other people in the guild.
---
Sure there is zero problem with doing the raids in bad gear and you by far have no need for the best at all. But the thing is. As a guild officer, I have to decide between "Take the guy who spend time farming the best gear" or "Take the guy who didn't" because there are not enough spots.
---
Aside from this, there are ways to make the game hard. Ever tried to run MC with 25 people?
---
People use the word memespec too losely.

For example, Holy specced Smite priest is a memespec, Shadowpriest is not.

I was playing on a semi-potato back then. Who knows if my memory has been distorted over time, I just wanted to share my anecdote.

Yojamba is 52% alliance and 48% horde according to wow population.com the other two are strongly horde favored.

Exactly

People make time for hobbies that they enjoy. I am busy at work as a doctor but i hit 60 in the first month and now i have a level 53 alt and also a lvl 40 one that I dont play. Sometimes on my work breaks I just farm stuff so i have my epic mount and a spare 500g. Sometimes I work 6 days but usually just 5. My other friends have different hobbies that they enjoy which they also spend lots of time on.

Played on Scriptcraft 1/2, Emerald Dream, Nost, Kronos 2, Felmyst and Netherwing, only shitters camp the graveyard, people ranking actually try to optimize honor farm. Sure you may be graveyard camped in the 5 1/2 minutes it takes the premade to win but no one actually ranking is going to delay winning to camp a graveyard where they get literally 0 honor because of diminishing returns.
---
ally do have it worse. if you think your situation as horde is as bad, you're just denying reality.
---
you can change continents with 0 pvping, alliance cannot. your towns have tons of guards, alliance do not.
---
Truth be told, you don't really need anything as long as the group is solid. But if you are looking to make things easier for yourself (and your guild), try get the some of the below for melee:  
---
- Get about 5 Greater Fire Protection potions (Rag mostly, but if you have extra coin then you can use them on lava packs/geddon)  
---
- Get about 5 Restorative potions for various bosses that place debuffs on you (Your mages/priests/pallys/druids should be debuffing, but restoratives save time + mana)    
---
- Get about 2 Greater Arcane Protection potions (Shazz)  
---
- Get about 5 Free Action Potions (Various fights with movement speed reducing effects)  
---
Chances are with a good guild you won't even use a fifth of these, but you can just save them for the next MC.
---
Sounds like you should stand by him the rest of the day
---
This is completely false. I'm sure there are corrupt loot councils out there, but I've yet to see one. I've been in LC guilds since actual vanilla, and 2 different ones since classic launched. Not an officer, not friends with officers,  dont even know who they are, and I'm STACKED son. Sounds like you have either experienced shitty guilds or (much more likely) read about how bad LC is just bash it every chance you get.
---
&gt;The only reason I keep it is because it's a good way to maintain a list of people who ganked you (right click -&gt; add to kill on sight list).
---
This is the entire reason i use it and always have.  Remove the targeting part etc but let it track kills/deaths and tell me if that Red name needs killed for a reason or just killed for being red.
---
Dabyrie farm

Dude.  Reroll on the minority on that server and endure all of phase 2 in it's fullness at 48.  I dare you.  But you cant quite experience what I've had the last 2 weeks and you never will.  You wont ever have too. 
---
Phase 2 rolled out 3 days before I hit 48 as a warrior, it's really that bad and bgs aren't going to do shit.
---
Unless you come from a contested zone, which every +20 zone is. You hearth or zone in and you still have the PvP flag for five minutes. If you’re attacked, it starts count down over.
---
How do I get my PvP title?  I have 23 HK’s and no dishonorable kills today alone.  Not counting what I got earlier in the week.  But still no Private Title with my character.  Am I missing something?
---
Common courtesy is what I had to teach a ton of people as well. Our first two raidweeks a majority of our people came at the last moment, required ports, didn't use consumables, etc.
---
Until I went full "fuck you" on them. Basically I just straight up told everyone how disrespectful it is to expect warlocks to spend 30 minutes farming soulshards just so they don't need to move their ass to Kargath on time. Added that they won't receive on time DKP if it happens next time. Then we put in place measures to reward consumable use and give minus DKP for not using consumes on Rag.
---
One week later, 5 people came and needed a port because they did not set their HS on Kargath. And aside from 2 people, everyone used consumes. Now, every single raid people are using consumes and last time there was no a single person who required a port.
---
Everyone has fun, the runs are super smooth and we only need 3 hours for 11/11 instead of 2-3 raiddays.
---
Edit: Sure we had a few people leave. But there were exactly 2 people who left because we were too hardcore for them and 4 people who left because we were not hardcore enough.
---
Cunning plan.
---
Yeah the difference in pace is crazy. I like both, actually. Classic is way slower and more RPG-like while Retail just feels fun for some reason.
---
Yeah, they are.
---
Hah
---
Lol we have ally rogues in Skeram by the AH and portal spot all the time.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers lots of folks leveling.I just created an alt today and Elwynn was busy.

From what I’ve seen they basically don’t fight back maybe try to run I’ve even had some running into walls lol
---
Sorry that having a different mindset than you makes me garbage. I already have 200 flasks saved in the bank and I just raid log and log in and flip. Nothing left for me to do till BGs come out
---
Very few people are actually needed you fucking troglodyte
---
You can have DKP with class/spec priority.
---
Thank fuck. Sooner the better. Imagine being such sycophant as to base the success of a video game on your favorite useless twitch personality who contributes nothing useful to society.
---
The most ironic part of the spy change was every one saying it would just cause addons to use the hidden channels. Turns out they didn't truly understand what they were asking for.
---
Five minutes and if they’re there when you zone in, you get attacked and the five minutes starts over. Have you actually played on a pvp server?
---
I play horde on Skeram and get ganked everywhere no matter where I go.  
---
Including in Orgrimmar.  
---
I'm sure Alliance have it worse, but there are gank squads on both sides.
---
Spriest is memespec, why not just have a healer with the points in shadow weaving keep the debuff up?
---
you can get to your mid 30s as horde without flagging yourself you can't even get to 25 as alliance, the FPs around the world are much better placed for horde, so no your biased af sir.
---
As weird as it is I don’t really like the races of the horse except for Tauren which has limited class selection and issues with doors.
---
I also find that most of the edgy gamers play horde side, and I’d rather play with adults that act like adults.
---
An adult horse’s brain weights 22 oz, about half that of a human.

Downvoted so the horde won’t camp that area as well.

Price on essences dropped because of elemental invasion, that will be happening at 10th Dec

You're biased too, git gud.

If a warlock life taps and dies because the healer was oom and cant heal him, its 100% warlocks fault.  But that is a situation you see a lot less then one where the healer has a lot of mana still left and is still refusing to heal the warlock because of his ego trip.
---
Why have anything other than mages and warriors do dps?
---
Any action that required server communication technically would exacerbate the problem..
---
But the root cause was always too many people in one instance.
---
"Just disable addons altogether" What world do you live in?
---
My xp and gold are the same as they were before disconnect
---
6 stacks of water is more than 1 mana pools worth of casting. it also has a cast time of 3 sec per 10. 6 stacks = 12 casts = 36 sec. 36 sec + drinking to get mana to make more water because i cant make 6 stacks on 1 mana bar. so yes it is a lot of time. time i could be using to do other things or selling people who value my time more than you. 
---
i value 2 minutes at more than 30s. if you think its worth only 30s im immediately closing trade and giving it to the person who values my time because you clearly dont.
---
Ok Boomkin
---
I really don’t know what you guys on PvP servers expected. This isn’t new. Every MMO, including vanilla WoW, has always been like this. 
---
If you don’t want to *constantly* deal with gankers/the potential of dying at any point, you need to switch to a normal server.
---
I love pvp but only in BGs or big open world battles. I prefer to be able to quest/level/travel/run dungeons without constantly looking over my shoulder. But hey, maybe that’s just me.
---
Is everything usually cheaper on the weekend?
---
Depends on the bot.
---
Some do nothing, some will run to you (or stay at range) and just auto attack, some are a bit smarter and try do combos.  
---
Most of the time, it's just nothing since the bots will just die and run back to their position to continue.
---
There’s a lot more people who never touched private servers playing on official blizz servers. Maybe 24 hours is an over estimation, admittedly, but it won’t be weeks. It’ll be a few days on the biggest servers. People are going to farm non stop for everything and just dump it all, there’s full server discord’s to help coordinate also that the big guilds will be using. I played northdale for awhile and I never was on a server discord, granted it was mostly for just a fun casual experience but still.
---
Can't get loot with 15 of the same class.
---
Wat
---
Well it seems like the problem that officer had was not necessarily that he was at 50% BiS but more that he was at 50% BiS but playing alts instead of his main.
---
Then the servers obviously just got a restart. What's the mystery here?
---
You realize Horde and Ally ranks are independent? Ally getting a crap ton of honor does not affect the Horde rank point distribution.
---
Funny timing and story and yeah farming can be hard with this, you come in and feel like you are intruding, and then when someone comes in and you are there first it can be irritating too.  I’ve been trying to whisper to people and offer to take turns, I’ve even buffed them when they come by sometimes.  Overall it’s improved the situation for me, but sometimes people are jerks still.  It just sucks and you are entitled to go in there and they are entitled to come into your space too.  But guess we are human and just overreact sometimes.
---
&gt;Could a warrior be a bot if he kinda switches between trying to close to intercept range and running away when kited? 
---
Hard to say.
---
If he does this EVERY time using the exact same method, it's probably a bot. If it seems like he's trying to do something like lure you or whatever, then it's probably a player.
---
But in general, if they follow the same pattern every time you do something to them, it's either a really simple player, or more likely, a bot. 
---
&gt;If he intercepts then feign death trap method doesn't easily work. Or that's just a farming player then?
---
It could be, but I've heard that bots are able to easily identify a real death and feign death so it's not necessarily confirmation.
---
This is the safest option, but you'll still probably die a couple time before even reaching BRM if you don't have stealth.
---
It's not even close, don't even try to compare them.
---
Welcome to hell.
---
Well he was right about the fishing part, Nat Pagle knew what was up
---
Or someone who has RMTed and is clueless, its a good 50/50.
---
Is there a way to look at the quests on the map? Like retail? If i'm gonna level up that way i would like to complete all quests after. Also, would i be losing lore knowledge if i don't read the quests?
---
&gt;The servers are also much larger, so the sheer amount of horde on servers with lopsided ratios is that much worse.
---
Yes, inflated population is the real problem. More people are starting to realize this. The game was balanced around a population of X, and now the population is XXXX.
---
Draenei are honestly the coolest race in wow. Takes from such a huge variety of cultures and works really well.
---
You're using way too many globals before mounting up IMO :P If you're going DM:E to farm lashers or jump runs just take the back entrance. You don't have to enter the courtyard at all that way and you get an extra lasher pack. Also, I'd recommend getting the Gnomish Cloaking Device - it can be quite useful in these situations ;) Obviously you have engineering 'cause why on earth wouldn't you?
---
Go Grobbulus for sure.
---
I just want to transfer off Heartseeker to actually be able to play the fucking game.
---
lmao who are the boys? we're there every day man don't miss us!
---
&gt; when we drink
---
Really should just drink/eat instead to save bandage debuff
---
It will be up next to all your buffs
---
Zing!
---
It's what we do for Dire Maul on Monday nights. Tuesday afternoon, hop in, get buffs, hearth for ony head and log until raid invites and the mass exodus to BRM. Not worth trying to get the Felwood cleansing buff but the rest are manageable.
---
I can assure you that hitting 60 is not going to prevent you from dying in a 10v1.
---
I don’t want artificial length in my leveling. The level grind already takes long enough in both versions and nobody actually cares about the leveling experience in either versions. I mean half these guilds don’t even let you have alts.
---
I wouldn’t buy a computer exclusively for classic man. I would either invest that money elsewhere or by a computer for other type of games. Classic isnt the game you think it is, it’s very boring after 56ish. Just a word of wisdom from someone who played at launch + vanilla
---
Doesn't seem like a problem other than I noticed an MC run that started Saturday and then they were starting up again today...on Baron. That's not a good sign. Should be able to clear MC in 90 minutes pretty easily.
---
I would much prefer /roll. Much more fun and exciting when you get a piece of loot and it’s the least likely to cause drama.
---
I tried not to today, read about your attack. HSed to OG, and by the time i got there it was clear 🤔
---
The most important thing is to get attuned. GFPPs will be helpful for the Ragnaros fight.
---
My favorite is when the person comes back and starts complaining about their marriage lmao
---
They are in the inn, at the flight master and at the mystic ward portal area. You literally cannot log out fast enough before getting attacked. You understand that pvp flag remains on as you zone in, there are multiple comments explaining this before yours and you’re insisting that they can’t be attacked except a, b, c, but they can be and are. Which the OP explained. 
---
Telling people to log out for ten minutes is not a realistic answer.
---
I was super excited for world PvP however I'm completely fed up with it.
---
I was pumped for TM/SS.  Except the lag was insane.
---
I was excited to Zerg bust.  Except it's just 30 mages AEing with sappers with 10 pallies healing.
---
I was enthusiastic about 5 man skirmishes.  Except we just get clobbered by raids.
---
I was joyful for some 1v1s.  Except you just get clobbered by raids.
---
I was burnt out but happy to disconnect and level an alt.  Except you get clobbered by raids and camped for hours on end.
---
Vanilla WOW was nothing like classic as far as world PvP is concerned.  Mob mentality has ruined this game.  I cannot wait for BGs to be released.  Maybe we'll get enough of these FOTM asslickers away to actually get some organized, strategic, stimulating wpvp once these faceroll meta following keyboard warriors have something else to do.
---
Once i logged there with my alt horde and atm the log screen ended the alliance began raiding Org. It didn’t take less than 3min to Horde gather a group and take ally away from there. They didn’t pass the innkeeper. It was epic. I’ve never saw a response so fast and effective like that.  
---
All in all, it’s just an outsiders option from one event i saw once but i found it nice.
---
RemindMe! 6 months "Ask this guy if he's clearing real content like C'Thun. Ask for raid logs since he's amazing and you can probably learn some tricks from him."
---
Fix their awful pvp system
---
See if there’s any Magic Dust on the AH if it exists in current patch. It will sleep the bear for upto 30 seconds and only breaks with damage so tame beast shouldn’t break the CC. 
---
Magic dust drops from Dust Devils in Westfall.
---
Not really. Just a little bit of gold to buy greens with nice stats from the AH.
---
&gt;So I've decided to start my adventure on classic WOW (never played vanilla) as alliance, but based on the current state of practically every PvP server at the moment, should I just wait for BGs to come out? 
---
I'm leveling an Alliance druid, I've gone from 20-49 on a PvP server since the Honor patch hit and as long as you avoid some of the most cluster-fucky areas, it's fine. Most of my deaths have been to players 5-10 levels from me rather than 60's. In general it seems that the higher level ares (50+) are the ones heavily camped, so by the time you get to 50+ the BG's will already be out.  
---
I'm in Searing Gorge right now, and yeah there's tons of Horde, but if you go into the caves or other areas that aren't a pathway to BRM, you're generally fine for the most part. 
---
&gt;I get that I could just play on normal servers, but then I fell like I'll be missing out on a huge part of the experience. 
---
This is entirely up to you... But I feel it's worth mentioning that very few players actually experienced 'proper' PvP leveling in WoW Classic.
---
We had layers when the servers came out and it was actually quite rare to find a bunch of Horde willing to engage in PvP, it seems like most people were just interested in leveling and the minority was there for PvP. Since the patch hit, it's the complete opposite. People will stop a quest when they're 90% of the way through it and chase you down across the map for 12 honor points, and I absolutely love it.
---
This is the horde player base in a nutshell, god damn ya'll are so fucking stupid it hurts.
---
I love that addon. It scans for active groups forming in general, trade and LFG and presents only the instances I am also looking for. Not sure why people got so angry about it. Eye saver indeed.
---
I like the people like OP who still don't understand how server sizes are several times larger than back in Vanilla and that is what the complaints are about. It's like he's being willfully ignorant.
---
In most cases spamming shadowbolt still does more damage than drain life, even as deep affliction without imp sbolt/bane/ruin.  If the healer can afford to spend the mana, runs will go faster if you're using sbolt instead of drains.
---
There are plenty of healers that know this as well, so I wouldn't assume they're healing you because they don't know any better.  In those cases, they would heal you because they'd prefer you do max dps to make the run go faster.
---
They moved the spawn to Ironforge
---
As i remember, there werent full lvl60 raids. Most were below level40.
---
It was more a cat&amp;mouse game in the barrens. But it was fun to see 3xlvl40s zerg down a lvl60.
---
just curious i dont play alliance, but why would u set ur hearth to Darn when u can just ask a mage to port you?
---
As horde i always keep my hearth in kargath and ask a mage to port me to any of the major cities (which for the horde are more conveniently spread throughout the continent); this makes for a much faster traveling. I never use zeppelins for example
---
Lol this is what everyone wanted
---
This is why I rerolled alliance top tier, 200 iq players like you.  I just can't keep up with the level of stupidity put out by the average horde player.
---
Deviate Delight is also close to 50-50 ratio, just a smaller community than Grobbulus.
---
Go stand by the king for 5 mins
---
I unironically did. Saying nothing is better than saying something dumb af.
---
I'm horde, but I got to skip STV by leveling in 3 different places: dungeons, especially SM (lots of quests, mobs and good rewards in there), Desolace (was ganked a few times, but nothing painful at all) and Dustwallow Marsh (this was by far the best fucking place to level imho. Good quests, lots of grinding spots, cool rewards and the chance to get scales from the whelps. The scales can be sold in the AH for almost 4g the stack of 5.
---
im sorry the entitled person believes me (and every mage)'s time is worthless and we should spend all our time giving random people water all the time for free or for pennies. we dont know you. we dont owe you jack shit. and we dont owe you our time.
---
you are one that is insufferable you entitled pompous jackass.
---
ur buffs don't scale with gear so its understandable why guilds have loot priority.
---
It won't matter now but it may matter later if contents get harder.
---
so you tank too?

Will there be Cross Realm Battlegrounds when those go live?
---
A: Cross-realm battlegrounds were a feature of 1.12 and are important for matchmaking, so you’ll be seeing cross-realm battlegrounds in WoW Classic when Battlegrounds are introduced in [Phase 3 of the content roll-out plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049)
---
Thanks.  Do the HKs stack towards the next title?  I think corporal is something like 200 HKs.  Or do you need to have that many in one week?
---
&gt; It sounds fine. You and your friends either move somewhere else together or you wait in the queue or you roll alliance/faction change.
---
I'm not talking when the servers were not up yet. I'm talking after the game had been out for two weeks or so. 
---
Or even now trying to get new players into the game. 
---
"You can't play with us because the factions are imbalanced sorry."
---
That would not fly. It works for ***private servers*** because it's free and there's really no expectations put on them to present a good product.
---
PvE realm boys, no wonder it feels like playing on releaseday currently there, why bother with all the ganking
---
If you want an addon that combines this functionality (also dismissing singular totems) and totem timers, try [Totem Dismiss](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/totemdismiss). I've been using it for a while and love it.
---
By rare I think he means in short supply in regards to PUGs/LFG.
---
It would be worth it to use a warlock weak aura, or at least a buff/proc announcer. If I remember correctly, the buff is named "Nightfall". When it pops up, you get an instant sb to tag onto the end of whatever spell you were already casting. I remember it being a very powerful talent.
---
If you're on a PvE server go Mage and AoE farm any of the high level areas.
---
If you're on a PvP server, probably better to go Hunter and farm instances.
---
Mages are less gear dependent, but all it takes is one counterspell/fear/person running through your AoE to take you out.
---
Heartseeker is owned by the alliance.
---
Blowing lines and fucking 9's /s
---
large brills arent worth much more because so many people run dungeons at 60 and DE a lot (especially in scholo with so many blue drops). i think a lot more people are running dungeons at 60 for BiS gear than enchanters running lower dungeons. although the shards are slowly going up in price (at least on my server)
---
Keep farming gold/levels inside DME.    
---
Send that gold onto a Rogue Twink and get some revenge in WSG.
---
World first BWL will be done by people who just run through UBRS 10 at a time. It'll be way faster.
---
Lmao I mean, sure it didn't happen in vanilla, but... What were you expecting?
---
You can't make people dumber or forget what they already know in meta. End game content for classic is boring, so what are max levels gonna do while they farm? Gank. Because why the hell not?
---
It's hilarious to see people like you bitching about it when you saw it coming a mile away.
---
What a hard hitting response. 
---
Even if it was "normal" server cap, you'd still have this exact same problem. Maybe not players all over the place, but important places like Blackrock Mountain and EPL would be camped ***for sure***. 
---
Face it. You guys didn't know what you were asking for when you wanted a 15 year old game with no modern changes to fix the issues that were waiting to happen. 
---
That's what happens when you demand a purity test with games like this.
---
The counterspell of shopping power always crits
---
Yeah, one guy told me to go there, and i did. I just didn't find enough quests because i didn't explore more. If i get time for christmas i might go to that place, specially because that's where Jaina (My favorite character) is.
---
Timer doesn't tick while offline. Doesn't work.
---
&gt;You drive a 1999 Toyota Corolla with 600,000 miles
---
&gt;I remember when I was as cool as that guy.
---
My 1994 Corolla *only* made it to 292,000 miles. I suddenly feel inadequate!
---
We also have rarespawns at SW since we've learned the BB-Ratchet boat has better guards than the Menethil-Dustwallow boat because reasons.
---
I love how people try to justify moonkin by their "utility" when it's all horrible utility unless the raid sucks.
---
The likelihood of us getting it is quite decent is why...  Greater than Classic+ for sure.  If you don't think they'll want to milk TBC and WotLK easy re-subs and nostalgia train then you may want to understand that for businesses it's all about the money.  These two legacy games represent EASY money.
---
??? I can play how I want and you can play how you want. I have limited time to play so I want to play efficiently... If my raid wipes even one time in progression raid with the boss at low hp and they've been giving out Talismans of Ephemeral Power to a boomkin or spriest and there are mages and locks who haven't received one I will be very upset, so I don't join those types of raids. 
---
I just raid log and flip on AH and log off, I spend maybe 6 hours a week playing so I found a group of like minded players and we just raid as quick as possible (flask 25 man, usually takes 2 hours for MC/Ony including travel time and world buffs) and say "see you next week!"
---
Gold is not hard at all to get in game. You just need money to make money. Why not just respec for raids and spec back if you want to spriest pvp? Or have a different main raid toon and keep your spriest on PVP spec and pay for GDKP loot? 
---
Like I said in my post, I'm not gonna raid in a raid that allows memespecs (or a DKP raid for that matter, lol) but that doesn't mean I have any problem letting others do what they want
---
yes that's how colluding work. You're gaining advantage over your fellow guildie and if they were any smart they'd do the same thing to equalize the field.
---
On literally all the big realms, Horde has more pop, which means even with Xrealm battelgrounds, horde will have like 1h+ queues when BGs come out, and what will they do for honor in the meantime? Exactly. 
---
This won't change in the near future, forget about your PvP realm char and just go PVE. There seems to be a giant influx there anyway, as I couldn't complete any quest at ~lvl 20 properly today with all mobs being camped.
---
Still feeling a bit guilty quitting my BiS lock but oh well, I just felt like shit doing anything in the world, cba anymore and I'm thinking, as many are I guess who hate this gankfest; why on earth didn't I just play PvE from the start...
---
This is like that meme. "Why would somebody just go on the internet and lie"
---
https://gyazo.com/8aae58ddcb8244d0f3d086edffe15bfa
---
Point to me where the guards are. Alternatively, log on your own character, go on a zep and show me the guards.
---
 
---
^(Hint: There are none &amp; you're **lying** ♥)
---
It only lasts 1 min. I've never had a problem with the debuff, usually I'm cleared of the debuff by the time I get to a point where I need to life tap to get mana and then afterwards, health back.
---
If you mean during combat when things get hairy, that's what I have my healthstone and major health pots for.
---
Who cares about Faerlina. You get what you deserve playing on that cancerous server
---
no we killed you because its fun and to read salty comments here
---
&gt; Best part is trying to get to Kalimdor, and you can't whisper anyone at all - so you just open trade with a mage and drop 1g in and since phase 2 is out he knows exactly what you want and the inv-&gt;darna port comes up.
---
Guy: "gimme the usual"
---
Mage: "one port to darnassus comin' right up"
---
Damn I wish they sold for that much on my server. I can farm like 15 in an hour.
---
On smaller servers, you won't run into people with the same regularity while farming out in the world. 
---
Gank squads in the mountain will be 10-15 people not 40+.
---
An UBRS group trying to get to the instance can have a chance against the gank squad. 
---
On a big server where 40+ are camping the mountain, they have no chance.
---
Private servers were never like this. The evidence that you're wrong is overwhelming. Face it, you don't know shit.
---
i feel like i relate to the orcs the best. im very tall and have a bit of a build to me, i had anger issues when i was younger. lots of people picke don me cuz i was an odd ball.
---
This may come as a shock to you but not everyone plays for PvP.  Neither is everyone a min-maxer.  A lot of players will want to play based on other choices like aesthetics, or maybe a nostalgia trip of replaying their favourite race from 2008-2009, or whatever.
---
Not sure what difference that makes in terms of fair world PvP
---
4 hours a day would land me a divorce and CPS call before 2020.
---
Yes.
---
I just like raiding but I will keep my full t1 orc warrior so I can have variety (I also have a mage and druid that I play more on the PVE server)
---
My guild has decaying dkp. So you can't just hold it forever either
---
&gt; They usually get purged in a larger sweep.
---
=
---
I mean for hacks, sure. Ban them in one sweep so the hack-makers don't know what tripped the system. But if someone is blatantly yelling racial slurs and expletives in world chat for hours, or if someone is spamming the hell out of chat, or if someone is repeatedly impersonating blizz chat, etc, I'd assume that they'd be fine with taking immediate action following sufficient evidence.
---
You get honor based on the damage you or your group does. If you're solo and do 99% of the damage and a warlock runs by and does 1 tick of damage to finish off the last 1%, you still get 99% of the total honor.
---
You are clearly not understanding what I am saying.
---
Nope!  That quest is practically a meme and should be preserved!
---
Yeah fine, I guess we can just kill the game then. It's a much better experience than the alternative. 
---
Do you even listen to yourself?
---
This! I playing with a priest is great I never have to drink tapping on renew tics will usually keep us going all the way through the dungeon.
---
Being a healer and preserving the 5 second rule is the skill cap, having a lock usually doesn’t shorten my runs up at all
---
&gt; You seem to think I'm saying you'll never die once battlegrounds are enabled whereas I'm saying it will be severely cut down because majority of the honor grinders won't be camping everyone in the world.
---
More on this. What they are doing is ***horribly*** unoptimized by the way. 
---
Players only yield so much honor per kill and it declines rapidly after the first one. 
---
They become victims of their own success because the more they pvp, the less the other faction will participate if they perceive it as unfair or unbeatable. 
---
And no, I didn't think that you were saying that you'll never die or whatever. 
---
I was saying that what you are experiencing now is what happens when you play a game like Classic in 2019. 
---
There's no secrets in the game and all the "routes" the "farm spots" the "hang out spots" whatever ARE ALL KNOWN PLACES THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PLAYERS KNOW ABOUT. 
---
There's a super robust website that catalogs and tracks all the information i need about the game. 
---
There's forums, LIKE THIS FUCKING ONE, where players can coordinate, share ideas, share tactics, all sorts of shit.
---
Players have access to more tools to organize SO MORE PLAYERS CAN COORDINATE PVP EVENTS AND RAIDS LIKE WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING. 
---
Vanilla players DID NOT HAVE THESE KINDS OF RESOURCES OR KNOWLEDGE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. 
---
Does...any of this make sense to you at all? 
---
Vanilla wasn't a completed game when it was released. There were a lot of problems with the design back then that got fixed and improved overtime. This is what happens when you take a game created in 2004, make absolutely no changes to it at all, and try to recreate it in 2019.
---
What server?
---
Alliance suck at pvp
---
Keep up the good work!
---
You bet yer darnassus yer buying that port
---
&gt; at least you can change continents entirely unflagged.
---
I mean, what's the point if you die the second you become flagged?
---
why do people even care about such losers. they are wasting the best years of their life nolifing a game and will gladly take my mcdonald orders in couple of years
---
It's a little more complex than x kills = x rank, but yes they stack in a sense. Though you lose rank points each week so you have to account for that.
---
I think it only resets if you fight back, I've seen players un-flag while I was attacking them lol
---
if u really want to introduce faction based queues, u have to introduce free faction change with it. Because otherwise 20% of the server will literally be unable to log in if your server is 60/40 for example. People dont deserve to be punished for a problem that blizzard created in the first place.
---
Why does no one use EPGP loot system? IMO it’s a really fair system that gives everyone a fair chance of receiving loot
---
Search for the wowmarket discord
---
You'll have fun then, happy grinding!
---
If you've never played any expansions then how are you qualified to say flying mounts are bad design?  
---
And also people who haven't played expansions keep saying the new zones 'invalidate' the old ones, but literally the same thing happens in vanilla.  Why would a level 60 want to piss around in low level zones?  Professions is the only exception that comes to mind, and even in TBC some of the old recipes still stand strong.
---
Hahahah, this is r/iamverysmart material. What really happened:
---
You played horde and were complaining about how Alliance has it better in every way, and how fuckin dumb they all are! Then you swapped factions and instantly felt the opposite way. "The enemy killed me, they must have some unfair advantage, it can't possibly be that I'm just god awful at the game!!" - Absolutely zero self-awareness 😂
---
More numbers means less chance you get somewhere empty.
---
So the TBC playerbase gets split two ways.  Great idea.
---
well, at least the people who know little/nothing seem to willingly expose themselves. of course there are certain times you want sword n board but the vast majoritty of the time for 5 mans or even UBRS you wanna be dw fury prot tanking
---
... and I acknowledge that if you come from a contested zone you will be flagged for pvp. 
---
If you log in, for the first time in a day and horde are attacking IF, you will NOT be flagged for pvp. However, as I said in my comment, unless you come from a contested zone this won’t be the case. It’s in my first sentence. 
---
As for my solution to logging out, I wasn’t aware that this solution doesn’t work. I’ve used this solution twice before and had no issues. I will perform an experiment myself to confirm. Happy to be corrected but do t appreciate being down voted with out an explanation. I’m just trying to help giving ideas.
---
then don't play it if they do it.
---
They aren't speeding it up for streamers, they're pacing it based on the playerbase in general.  It doesn't necessarily need to stick to the 2004-2005 release cycle like glue.
---
You call it ridiculous but it's really not.  Imagine being a new player and having to progress through the entire of Vanilla's progression just to start on the TBC ladder.  It would be far too steep a barrier to entry.  TBC gets unfairly shat on for this, but every expansion has been the same.  Expecting new characters or new players to have to progress linearly through Classic, Naxx etc JUST to start working towards 70 or getting geared for Kara?  Ridiculous.
---
BfA died way before flying
---
what were you like? We need to know.
---
I mean, this is nothing new. I literally did this in vanilla myself. Gank people in IF, vanish or die, repeat
---
The best way to tell, is that the mob you're fighting is already dead. 100% chance to proc when you don't need it!
---
You want honor not HK's, but yes the more honor the further you go. But there's no set in place amount of honor needed to get somewhere. It's all rather complex.
---
The more efficient players can do their job in a raid the less players you bring which means you can gear people faster... We just flask and 24 man MCs so each person can have more loot
---
Your terrible logic continues.  
---
You're the one making the affirmative statement. It is your responsibility to support those claims. It's that simple.
---
yes, why wouldn't he expect this authentic vanilla experience? everyone knows it was always like this since the beginning
---
BuT mUh Xp PeR hOuR
---
Try this instead:
---
    /castsequence reset=target !Shoot, null
---
idk if you're trying to be cute or this is just a weapons grade bad take but it's funny regardless
---
Naxx will get cleared on the first day by the top guilds. Of course other guilds are going to take longer and some will never complete it. Naxx is still going to be cake compared to the challenge of any modern raid at higher difficulties.
---
who are your guys? pro pvpers tardboy and likeabause?
---
I see you all over with this shit. More of an alliance thing LMAO. Butthurt horde boy over here. You rolled horde on an alliance dominant server? If not then shut the fuck up, see you whining in multiple threads.
---
I'm a healer that heals anyone.  It has never been an issue for me.
---
Its quite surreal..Tips for the alliance, most people here are solo/very small groups. because its the best way to farm honor.
---
You can defeat almost every one with well organized 10 man raid. We got wiped by 10-15 man in a top T section of BRM while trying to enter MC with 40 ppl. Sapper charges are strong as fk.
---
There were two alliance gangs today pretty effectively holding this T section and the entrance to MC. But I would find much more annoying if they move around Searing Gorge and farm horde there as well (Im one of those honor farmers).
---
Main issue is the honor system encourages this. The best way to farm honor as a horde ATM is just to kill everyone trying to get to BRM.
---
And BTW theres a lot of horde at the north entrance, but the south entrance is relatively ok, You might want to use that instead.
---
Edit: I keep an eye on our top two honor farmers (Flamelash-horde). Warrior is usually sitting at TP Flightmaster and Rogue is Farming red in Ironforge
---
No, the drop rate is that low. Gorosh has about an 8% chance to spawn, and the chest has about an 8% chance to drop as well. I measured the spawn rate from my 125+ runs without it dropping.
---
I play on Tarren Mill, and there were lots of people around. Week or so after flying came out I logged in for those free 3 days we got. Absolute ghost town.
---
So you've been worth honor for one level? Sweet summer child. Winter is coming.
---
Sounded perfectly fine till you got to the part where raid team 1 got 1,000 DKP.... They're using the second team as glorified pugs to abuse and gear themsellves. Get out.
---
Resilience is fine.  People who complained about it did so because they didn't have any and their opponents did.
---
More stam would be similarly debilitating for people in no gladiator gear vs. people in gladiator gear.  They'd complain all the same simply because they're not competitive.
---
A modern PVE server has more pop than a PVP server did back in vanilla. By a large margin....
---
THANKS BLIZZARD FOR MY GENUINE CLASSIC EXPERIENCE
---
Yeah every expansion is the same and it sucks. And it would suck to have to have new players have to progress through everything to get to TBC. Thats not what im suggesting there is definitely a middle ground. It could simply be allowing old raid gear to be upgraded to raid tier level gear for TBC. New players could still progress as normal.
---
Not necessarily a perfect solution but currently they literally scrap old content to the point of allowing you to currently walk in and one shot ragnoros unarmed in retail. This mindset is so bad for the game long term
---
Make sure you get Mongoose, Elixir of Giants, Grilled Squid(optional) as well, these are you dps consumes. 
---
I'd just buy a stack or two for the first raid, you won't use that much not even close, but you'll have leftovers for next.
---
You're right in the sense that someone can only give you so much Honor in 24h, but they're not farming each other there (well, they might have until they were worthless), but they are creating a blockade for both factions on a very populated spot making it impossible for anyone but themselves to farm here, and they also seem to have some sort of treaty between them. They are mutually enabling each other to be able to farm this spot, without making other Alliance players being able to join or Horde players either. They literally made an Honor machine for themselves with no competition, and you need faction collusion to do that.
---
I wouldn't trust wowhead guide, but full T1 is better than 6 pieces t1 and 2 t2.
---
What the heck are you talking about?  You have to level alts through those exact same zones in TBC, you know?  Plus the new starting areas are also extremely 'rich and compelling'.
---
Just because you don’t see people doesn’t mean it’s more or less dead. I’m basing it on how much of my friend list/guild logs on. Sharding will always make the world seem more alive even when it’s dead. You see less people after flying because everyone is in the air rather than being visible on the ground.
---
OP doesn't know what hes talkin about
---
Wtf is that resolution lol
---
It will, I agree, because they will know what to expect and they will be ready. I have some friends in really good guilds on Mograine, and they're already farming stuff. But vast majority of players don't play in top guilds, and they aren't preparing for it, that's where it will hit the hardest. 
---
Tactics wise, yes. It's a piss compared to modern tactics, I don't think anybody in the right mind disputes that. But again, the amount of preparation and the numbers is the difficult part.
---
I'm pretty sure all dps play with alt-z the whole time (or whatever hides the ui)
---
You are the 500th person to post this.
---
Then what's stopping you now?
---
Exactly this, plus the most annoying/longest part of MC is trash clearing, not boss fights. Bringing a boomkin/spriest who spends more time drinking doing comparable (at best) damage is basically asking other people to carry your weight. If you're fine with it, you're fine with it but to me I'd rather just bring as few people as possible to clear quickly and efficiently so everyone gets more loot
---
You can use the Curse desktop app to install/update addons or install them old school style by downloading them and manually extracting the files to the _classic_ wow addon folder (usually C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\ but check to be sure).
---
Really? Yikes.
---
Blasted Lands is not too bad on my server.
---
They said Classic will stay around as long as people are playing it.  They literally fucking said this, so don't accuse  him of putting words in people's mouth.
---
screen fried by my radiance
---
If they wanted no changes, they should have kept similar server populations to vanilla.
---
Regular flipping is kinda weak. But you can do big flips with new content. For example with DM release I bought 30 pristine black diamonds for about 12g each, and sold them just before launch for 35g because casters/healers need the diamonds for enchants. Now they are down to 16g and I'm laughing all the way to bank.
---
I understand what you're basing it on, but that's a personal situation. My guild was rather active, all the way through to classic release, and a bit afterwards as well. Irrelevant though, it died, and that's what matters. Hopefully Activision Blizzard will learn at least a bit from that whole ordeal.
---
Two levels. It's 48 + 49.
---
Either way that's pretty irrelevant, OP is asking about waiting to roll on a PvP server until BG's come out due to fear of constant ganking.
---
The point is that leveling up to 50 is pretty 'normal', and since there's almost no chance that the OP is going to get to level 50 in the next 8~ days unless he dedicates his life to it, it should be fine by the time BG's come out.
---
This. As a paladin, it's the dumping all at once, after a fight, that pisses me off.  I can't heal on the move, I'm not allowed to engage the 5s rule, so warlocks doing this shit is super rude. The worst is I'll predict they will do this, heal them up with a free crit heal after the fight, then sit and drink, meanwhile, they will go, oh, full up? *Taps more down below 50% and stands idle while I drink*. Like, fucking come on at that point. Just drink or eat when I am.
---
The difference is the server population numbers.
---
Every addon gives you the upper hand vs not having it.  Addons aren't going anywhere.
---
Two character, gorilla sinew 1 kill each. Zhvra Hooves took 4 kills on my shammy too. That fucker has seen some luck
---
I thing they will. Most of us are there because its the best way to farm honor ATM. That will change dramatically when the BGs are out.
---
PSA, it doesn't fucking matter.
---
Thanks.... from many servers, currently. Each server is *technically* different, but most are the EXACT same.
---
So you were late and couldnt move with the group. Sounds like its your own fault. Cause even before p2, there was a lot of pvp infront of ony.
---
So stop being salty and start being on time
---
"hang on, this meme worthy"  lol
---
You dont replace axe of orgrimmar until crescent staff. Unless youre funded
---
Gotcha, that makes sense
---
Yeah, because they're by far the best for levelling
---
The #nochanges was always dumb. Vanilla was riddled with issues that blizzard fixed later on. It's just their fixed sucked and ended up ruining the game imo. For me the hope of vanilla was always they'd resolve the issues in a better manor. But seeing them cave and add in the bad spell batching from vanilla was a bad sign lol.
---
PvE is my jam because I just love exploring and wandering.
---
On a serious note, did you msg a GM about selecting the wrong item?
---
You literally would have a net gain in boss dps for the raid by replacing them with an optimal spec, hence why they're a meme spec. 
---
AND the bigger deal is that they have to spend more time drinking to do comparable damage on trash clears (and can't AoE in many cases) so they make everyone spend more time every single raid that they wouldn't have to if replaced with an optimal spec. Some raids are fine with this and some aren't; there's nothing wrong with either way; just let people have fun and enjoy the game!
---
Your name implies you would. Your attitude reveals otherwise....
---
Meanwhile you make water and get tipped 20g for 5 stacks.. Okay keep talking mage.
---
cringed so hard im gonna need dental work im sending you the bill
---
Faction imbalance is the source of the current PvP server woes.
---
Battlegrounds do nothing to solve that.
---
Faction queues solve it.
---
It's pretty simple really
---
yes you would have to know what layer you are on but i don't think that would be a hard thing to implement
---
I'm currently debating rolling on Pagle myself as an Ally.  How is the economy and ability to find groups?
---
Blizzard needs to remind players that they will never ask for your password more often.
---
Happy to entertain :) Good night ♥
---
you can EASILY tank any 5 man as fury/arms dps spec with any half competent healer
---
Pretty unfortunate too since it'd be a great semi way to force factions to not get to out of hand, since people wouldn't want to end up with 40min queues for a single bg
---
Wife aggro makes me cringe everytime I hear it. In my experience, the only people who say it seriously are people who seem to be neglecting their wife and household responsibilities.
---
Do you have a link to that list? I'm curious how many small things were changed compared to the bigger changes that most of us know about.
---
not true at all
---
 on balanced servers ships on both sides are camped by rogues and in high level zones you can do quest only if currently yours side zerg is bigger. Zergs do not want to fight each others if there is possibility to lose, they want to farm honor. Been here, saw that.
---
Low level questing zones looks safe (sub 40)
---
Thanks mate, I'll prolly go hunter due to PVP server. Not sure if I'll take it to raids, just want something to funnel gold into the tank (for consumables and such).
---
But i die 3 times a day. Oooph so much pain please understand me, i am but a poor hordie.
---
Wondering that too
---
bandages, healing pots, fire resist pots for rag. you can get elixirs and more various pots but i'd say those things are the key ones and mc is so easy now i wouldn't bother with more unless your guild is fresh and struggling somewhere.
---
start following the BiS guides for what dungeons to be running and what bosses in said dungeons you make sure your group hits
---
don't need the BiS to get into MC though, average groups can still clear it with less than 40 people and we take anyone in our guild 55+ so you'll be fine unless it's a hardcore guild or a speed run.
---
make sure to ask the raid leader if you aren't sure on a boss either, it's all pretty simple but there's a couple of bosses you can cause issues on if you don't know what you are doing.
---
Yeah hard
---
There is a website with maps of the dungeons that includes the path you should take to each boss, in what order.  Have this open on a second screen and you will always know which way to go. 
---
Google wow classic maps for tanks.  You will find.
---
What's raid night for your server? Based on mines discord we have guilds raiding all nights of the week including weekends.
---
Wpvp scene isn't terrible on pagle and bgs will be out soon!
---
bags are the big one
---
No, it isn't; you're mixing the healer with the water from vendor. Spend the silver and drink like everyone else instead of making someone work for you. The healer is there to heal the tank mainly, and help out the group with any mechanic that has unavoidable damage.
---
Wait are we sure this isn't stalaag?
---
Retail is a roller coaster. Fast paced, relentless action, a spectacle for the eyes and ears, but not very deep or intricate for the most part. Classic is a really good novel series. Takes some extra time and work, definitely some boring parts, but the more you put into it the better it is.
---
Wife beer kid or piss.
---
nice
---
Sorry m8 vanilla was a perfect game, classic is far from it (at least for me)
---
Ahhh getting to that IQ2000 I see welcome to the Druid Society.
---
Just because it has the word shadow in it doesn't mean it's necessarily shadow magic. If rogues had a talent called Master of the Shadows, would you assume that they were using shadow magic too? 
---
"Shadow" can have many meanings and connotations, not least of which is... you guessed it, an evil spirit (e.g. you can call an evil ghost a "shade").
---
And yes I know warlocks use shadow magic in WoW, but to be mythologically consistent, my headcanon is that, in actuality, warlocks do sorcery, by which they get other entities to do shadow magic for them. A stretch, I know, but it's the only way I can avoid getting annoyed about the wanton misrepresentation of mythology in WoW and video games in general.
---
Ive started my wow career as Undead Warlock. Im gonna end it the same.
---
And enemies aren't always frozen, and any extra chance to crit is huge
---
Most of the set bonuses are laughable at best.
---
I agree with all that. There's a lot that's changed, no reason we can't tweak things, especially if we get a poll with a large majority of players to agree or something like that, etc.
---
Thanks guy for taking the time to leave a comment but you must have been really busy during that time because you forgot to read my comment before running your mouth. When did I ever complain about mages using conjures for money?  “Spoiled little shit” thanks man at least I’m not an envious little bitch. With love!
---
"colluding" lol....
---
If they were trading kills for honor sure but they're just letting a guy live. 
---
Should I also be banned if I /wave at some Horde herbing and don't kill them? How preposterous. 
---
BathrobeDwayne has been trying to go viral for months, first with the Asmongold bait attempt now this.
---
What is the rationale for him not wanting you to participate ?
---
I'm gonna agree with you in that warlocks aren't the "good at magic" caster class because their whole thing is taking the dirty, quick and easier route to power (often at the cost of well being, sanity, life, etc). But like, spirits? 
---
Demonology, MAYBE, could be stretched to sourcing their power from "spirits". Like I disagree but there's a conversation to be had there. But like affliction and destro warlocks are just using easily accessible magic kinda badly BC they don't care about the cost of power, only the output.
---
Usually the night following the server/instance reset.
---
All our ferals have accuria. Hit is hard 2 get on druid gear.
---
Nothing new here. They've been colluding since Classic launched. They are literally the Devilsaur Mafia.
---
&gt;video of one guy not being killed
---
holy shit!!!!!
---
You should always go from Burning Steppes as alliance.
---
BASED
---
Sounds like such a boring way to play the game, doesn't it? What's the point of even playing it? It's nothing but a job to obtain bragging rights on an internet forum.
---
I wish I had fucking gone Horde, my entire faction is composed of cowards who quit at the first sign of resistance.
---
At least I'll get fast queues.
---
Classic WoW Redditors rise up!
---
I will try to find the post with the audio link but I think it was during Q2 sometime recently after release of Classic. When I have some time I will dig it out and repost here.
---
Yah this game sucks dick.
---
This is what you people been crying for? You wanted to play this trash?
---
Tell him to fuck off and gquit.
---
We  clear Ony and MC in roughly two and a half hours including the time it takes to move between them, so I don't sweat it that much. Like I said when it comes to BWL I'll be bringing consumables until we have it on farm, but otherwise it just seems excessive as a requirement.
---
I played casually 4 hours a day, reached level 38 in about 2 weeks and re-rolled and got to 60 in 4 weeks on my new toon. I assume the average player can make 4 hours a day but that might be overestimated
---
Is anyone else bothered by his all caps?
---
being a Dad Gamer should be a bannable offense.
---
Because I don't want player interactions to be artificially gated behind a pvp flag. Because I like wPvP. But guess what, I don't think a system that does nothing but encourage players to kill the opposing faction until they want to hang themselves is a good thing. In fact, it's a VERY BAD thing. It's been a trash system since 2005 and the current situation just proves it.
---
Is there a website for best gear in slot at your current level? I know all the 60 gear i should have, but ive probably got another 2 months to get there. Knowing what quests to do for upgrades would be sweat.
---
this says whitemane has 0 queue but im sitting in a 600+ for it right now
---
This is what I referred to. +1
---
Shit, i was on a quarter before the elapsed raid time! I could not make in time because they starter a bit early and i made much later because of the ally.
---
If i came there earlier i could have done it, but It d'ora not mean i was late myself.
---
Please no, what a waste of gcds. Just tap regularly and not back to back. Get ready to tap some more if i drop a renew on you
---
We saw the same song and dance when people posted proof of guilds locking down ungoro to strangle the leather market. Blizzards response was “if you don’t like what people are doing don’t play with them”.
---
There might be action taken but I really doubt it.
---
There's a weak aura to check for this. Search on wago.io
---
We post on reddit waiting for the two minute rezzes.
---
In essence: Ally you better queue the fuck up or I'll murder you if in searing gorge.
---
THERE TOO MANY FUCKING PEOPLE IN ONE SERVER
---
You don't have to attack every red name you see. It's okay to have people you don't want to fight. OP is a clown.
---
sounds like you'd have a better time if you gave in and sucked your tank's dick here and there
---
Oh I was saying all if us are drinking at the same time. I get all those points.
---
That makes sense. 
---
You said Tribute runs make ~120+ g/h, what do you think the equivalent average g/h is for a mage at this stage? I suppose as better gear gets released new and better farms will open up? Do you have any idea about future g/h?
---
Do what ever you like... most mages right now are frost cause " iTs tHe oNlY vIaBlE sPeC" right now.... play fire if you want...or go arcan/fire etc. A good mix of 2 spelltress..
---
Thanks for the tips - I am not familiar with that back entrance (I played WotLK/Cata) so I'll look into that. 
---
I've thought about if the GCD usage, and I think it's worth it - you can see at one point my Fear Ward stops a fear, etc. 
---
I don't have Engineering right now, but I likely will in the future. Maybe I could use Invisiblity Potions (the skill I have, Alchy)  to accomplish a similar thing. 
---
Thanks again.
---
Well it will most certainly help a lot. BRM is stupidly far away from any horde battle master and that is the most camped area right now.  
---
As for camping the flighmasters specifically, that's happening to the horde a lot even on horde dominated servers (or at least on Flamelash) and TBH 1-3 corpse runs? Thats not that bad. Its a pain, but not unplayable.
---
Defending org isn't the greatest honor for horde.
---
Alliance respawns take a long time.
---
It is usually the same players too, which means you don't get any honor after killing them 4 times.
---
I've recently been leveling a Druid alt (49atm), I've never played a tanking class so it was my first experience. I didn't tank an instance until SM at around level 39~, it was my first time tanking, and other than a few things I'd heard anecdotally, I had no idea what to do.
---
My advice is probably not the best, but I've gotten good feedback regarding my tanking and I usually just do the following:
---
- Always keep aggro off your healer, this means using your taunt (Growl or whatever) if there's ever a mob going to your healer. It's a 10 second cooldown with no rage, so feel free to use it when necessary  
---
- For larger groups, spam your Swipe to generate aggro  
---
- If there are multiple enemies, use Demoralizing Roar to reduce their overall DPS and make life easier for your healer  
---
- Watch the target-of-target to see which person the mob has aggro on, try to taunt that mob  
---
- For single targets, just use Maul to hold aggro  
---
- Faerie Fire is great for ranged pulls  
---
- Charge at runners to stop them getting too far  
---
- Try keep your mobs all clustered so that you can tab between them to see who has aggro, taunt or focus on that one to regain aggro  
---
&gt;Is it worth the respec’ing and investing in all new gear?
---
I don't think you need to respec at this point, but there's a talent that increases your bears threat if you have trouble holding aggro. In general just being within 2 levels of the final boss of the instance is all you really need. 
---
As for new gear, I'd say just hold onto items that are better for healing/tanking as you level, and swap to those if necessary.
---
If I have the choice between 2 players and one just straight up invests more in becoming stronger. Why should I take the weaker player? Would be unfair to the stronger one.
---
Pay no attention to that twat 
---
You didnt really make many mistakes. I would have taken some different pathing but even that wasnt guaranteed to work.
---
Its just a shitshow
---
Log out and play an alt for a minute!
---
Thanks for the response!
---
I don't mean to come across as...a dick, but the default options should cause the least amount of issues. Rarely do people look at the options/settings so yeah
---
I didn't make the video bruh, that's not me.
---
Nothing is stopping me now.

Questie is great. Wish this existed 15 years ago.
---
But why should I take you instead of the other guy? You certainly don't seem like someone I would take because he is so sympathic  and fun to have around lol.
---
For 305 weaponskill which I assume you have from talents, your crit cap is 34+hit. So you are 5% off already, with songflower you would hit it.
---
Just  got accuria.  Cost me 4 weeks worth of dkp though.  For some reason, the hunter bid me up like crazy.  it's not even good for a hunter?!
---
First choice was vanilla, but ofc that's in the past. Second choice was the vanilla as per private servers, but blizzard failed to recreate that due to faction imbalance. I don't recall anyone asking for an unplayable gankfest - but nm, I can't imagine it'll be around much longer. I guess the next big thing will be a surge of private servers based in various non-US/non-EU regions.
---
There are two crit caps, auto attack and ability.  You will not hit the ability crit cap.  You absolutely can hit the auto attack crit cap.
---
To determine your crit cap, start with 100.  Take away 40 for glancing blows (60).  If you have 305+ weapon skill, you take away 25 for misses (35).  Add back your total hit (in this case you say 10, (45).  Then take away about 5.5 for dodges (39.5).  Your auto attack crit cap is 39.5.
---
There is one final issue, which is your "paper" crit chance, the one in the spell book is going to be -3% if attacking a 63+ mob.  While it may SAY you have 39%, your actual crit chance is going to be 36%.  So while 39.5 is you crit cap, you would need your "paper" crit to be 42.5% to actually crit cap.
---
It certainly puts stress on things haha
---
Bro, the one time I paid a tank for a UD Strat run was the best run of my life, so we did back to back 30 minute clears. That guy wouldn't have been there without payment.
---
Tailoring gets you a BiS chest, truefaith vestments. 
---
General rules: level as shadow. Look up a list of wands to get while levelling and always try and keep your wand up to date as it's your main source of damage while levelling. Split points between wand spec and spirit tap to begin with and then go full shadow. At 40, respec to 31 points in shadow.
---
Ideally you should have enough spirit that spirit tap regens most of your mana between mobs. Mind blast, SWP and then possibly a smite, at 50% hp or less just wand a mob down. You start regening mana 5 seconds after your last cast and then spirit tap kicks in when you kill a mob so as you move onto your next pull, you'll have regened most of the mana you just spent. Ideally you never have to drink, but you will still have to occasionally as mistakes happen or your gear may be slightly bad at a given level.
---
blizzard sucks honestly
---
To be fair depends on the situation, I’m casually ranking and had some warrior follow me around basically because he couldn’t be bothered to hunt he just auto followed me and spammed shit on my targets.
---
If you were leeching in the way or for a long time makes sense if someone did that with mob tags you’d cuss them out and get them banned for griefing but if he’s just mad other people are pvping in the same place he’s a wanker.
---
Meanwhile, I'm having a blast on a PVE server!
---
Why not reroll? Level an alt on a PVE server (or transfer, if that's an available option, I'm not sure)? The amount of effort spent raging on this subreddit... I'm sure much of it could be resolved by going PVE.
---
After you've been steamrolled by 10 premades in a row, what will you do next?
---
1crit = 12sp
---
5int = 1 spellpower
---
This is the rough comparasion, they will differ based on your spellpower and crit so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Our leader refers to himself as the “captain” of the ship. So no one is allowed to talk to him until we go through 2 of his right hand officers. Then only when things gets escalated to him, will you be able to speak to him. 
---
Also, his “orders” are always final. And he doesn’t take in any opinion of anyone outside of his officer circle.
---
:p you are angry because you know why haha
---
When I see these videos I always try to refrain from saying things like this... but damn do I feel like Stalagg is worse than most examples shown.
---
My spidey senses tell me he has a macro to instant reply with "You mad bro?"
---
it's not collusion to not attack every red name you see, brainlets lol
---
Faction imbalance wasn’t a problem before honour came out. Imbalance simply existing isn’t a problem. It’s only when honour came out did it become a problem.
---
BGs take the same number of people out yes. But if everyone is queuing up they will likely be in the cities where the battle masters are. They will also return to the battlemasters when they finish their battle ground.
---
Motivation to go out into the world will reduce when people start realizing that by the time they get back to thorium point or wherever they are camping their queue is about to pop.
---
do you think the character stats addon (shows your stats on your character menu shows the same crit in your spell book?)
---
Fuck’m
---
Imagine comparing being ganked in WoW to being a rape victim...
---
You'll never find ally alone you mean. Any 50+ zone you'll see hordies leveling alone and alliance either being 60 rogues or travelling in honor farming groups of 3+. Just logged off, felwood was unplayable as mid 50s with bands of 3+ 60s just rolling up and down the main road. At 3am sunday night. I was killing shit in the underground shrine at Jaedenar, literally invisible to spy until you stand right on the entrance, at some point a 60 rogue started corpsecamping me. Underground. Now that's some elite pvp.
---
Or, and hear me out, you're full of shit. 
---
Again, lovely chat, dude. You've been excellent.
---
Go into your blizzard combat settings and turn on auras. A notification will pop up saying shadow trance when you are in combat and you can sling that sweet shadowbolt. 
---
Without that turned on you have to keep a close eye on your buff bar area to see when that tiny window pops up, which I don't recommend.
---
so i should just go with 34+ hit% as a general guide?
---
also does crit cap go up by 1 per hit %?
---
If the populations on the servers weren't overblown, it wouldn't be this bad.
---
I hear mages has been able to farm 100-120g per hour boosting people, however that obviously requires a crowd. For more consistent farm I believe lasher+satyrs is about 70g per hour.
---
As for the future, Hunters will actually make even more gold per hour as large brilliant shards becomes valuable allowing you to DE blues for more gold. With ZG mage  have the best aoe farm method unlocked(at least theorically.. obviously I can't see the future), however it is crazy fucking hard. On pservers this was anywhere between 100 and 200g per hour because well gold per hour literally depending on how many fuckups you did . Also maraudon rock elemental farm might go up to like 80-100g per hour.
---
All of these requires a good amount of skill, decent gearing, and a hella lot of patience.
---
It's neither fun nor exciting when you're on the ass end of that RNG.
---
Well yeah... But as more people 60, it's less likely they're going to hang around lower level areas ganking people trying to level.
---
It gets old after a while and with the exception of some iconic areas like Tarren Mill/Southshore, I can't see The Hinterlands being a PvP nightmare forever.
---
Dude I like PVP. 
---
The problem is every 20 yards of the world is camped. There are 15-20 people just grouped 24/7 EVERYWHERE. All level 40-60 zones. All day. There are no fights, just grinding. The alliance on Herod is basically dead. No one is buying shit on the AH. Just raid logging. I’ve been waiting for classic for fucking years and I’m about to dip to go to a private server. This is complete and utter aids.
---
This is why you need to form your own three man farm group with friends utilizing the window skip to save time (or recruit people and pay them for runs, a healer, tank, + you. Pass drops to them - Anger drops good vendor loot. 5x runs per hour adds up in gold quick.) Don’t leave drops like that to chance FFS, too many utter cabbages in full PuGs.
---
Fuck I’m annoyed just thinking about the scenario you shared.
---
Download Necrosis add-on, it has visual and audio warnings for this.
---
https://m.imgur.com/Sp2nM3j
---
Post the whole SS next time. Didn't your r/Arugal post get enough attention?
---
Just roll pve.  You can still PVP on it. I hace 3 pretty high toons on a PVP server just sitting there because they weren't fun to play anymore. So I rolled into a PVE server and am having alot more fun. You can willingly choose when you want to PVP.
---
Well the thousands of people people who use the addon, blizzard and 15 years disagree with you. So pretend all you want that you have somehow won if that makes you feel better about yourself.
---
Addons have been communicating with each other in this fashion ever since Vanilla. 
---
I highly doubt it all or a sudden became an issue.
---
You completely ignored the rest of what I just said. That data is "WRONG" The information they collect is "INACCURATE" and if you're doing to ignore this, don't expect a reply. Because honestly, If your reading comprehension is worse then a 12-year-old, then I don't want to have a conversation with you.
---
Edit reason (wanted to add more) the way they collect information is fundamentally flawed and doesn't work. ANY information on that site is made up of a flawed gathering technique that doesn't work because blizzard changed the API so it cannot be done correctly.
---
Yikes.. that'd be a gkick from me dawg. He's talking a lot of shit on here too.
---
min/max is fun to a lot of people, but I think he was referring to making your progress in later phases needlessly difficult by bringing memes for the lulz
---
It's decent but not worth over MC rings. I have band of sulf/archmagus and they're both better for PvP. When you already have 58% crit with shatter going to 59% is a very insignificant average damage increase(~0.6%)
---
While there's no guarantee you'll get those MC rings they drop fairly often and usually see little competition. Certainly beats taking a BiS piece from someone for an item you'll potentially replace in under a week.
---
&gt; STV
---
Oh you wanted to just waltz through Stranglethorn Vietnam?
---
We have a boom and an SP with sub 2hr MC, plus fewer people mean slower trash so your logic seems contradictory. SP also tops boss fight charts. Proper utilization of meme spec may be necessary but is in no way a waste of a raid slot
---
I have a wife, she understands
---
That’s abuse. Plain and simple. He should be reported.
---
Holy shit this is 10000/10
---
Not my guild. Someone from the guild posted that last time he tried this drama. Just thought I'd share.
---
They won't be missing any resets. This is why the GM is not allowing pugs. OP just cropped out the part that said all that for attention.
---
 
---
To all those defending Charlie. Please. I’ve also been raiding with him since the start of their first MC. But his attitude just outright disgusts me with him having the audacity to make such an announcement.
---
Please take a look at the time stamp. This was his ORIGINAL message before the heavy raging and finally editing his message to what we have on our discord now.
---
I haven't really looked into it but I'd love to see the numbers behind this whole debate. People want to go on and on about how bad their dps is. I want to see some real world (not just calculated nonsense based on perfect situations) numbers showing the difference between 5 "normal" casters (mages/locks) vs 4 "normal" casters + a boomkin in their group. Their DPS may not compare to a mage but giving 5% crit to 4 other people is a pretty good boost.
---
I don't believe you because others posted the full picture. Stop deceiving people on reddit and go gquit and keep some dignity before you get kicked for being an lying cunt.
---
At least you have the opportunity to switch continents safely, alliance cannot. What about that is confusing? If you’re in org and want to go to eastern plague lands you can go with 0 pvp. If you’re in uc and want to go to dire maul, you can get to feralas with 0 pvp. For alliance, switching continents alone is a chore, for horde it’s trivial
---
Could always play on a pve server.
---
Paladins make up for it in wpvp they are op af
---
Get over yourself.
---
Wow thanks a ton for linking this!
---
I mean, you can have a healer priest that shadowweaves, not like you really NEED that sp to bring the debuff
---
I don’t know if it will be satisfying or not coming back to this sub in 12 months and see all the horde who were saying shit like ‘ZuG ZuG go back to retail’ complaining about not being able to open the AQ gates because there’s no one on the other faction. It probably won’t be because no one will even care anymore when the games dead.
---
Rick’s body has become part of IF’s deco, it’s always lyin around somewhere in front of the bank
---
Questie does what you're looking for, adds markers for new quests and completed quests, nodes on the map for where the quests are.
---
Even though I unsubscribed I suggest you to give it a go. Had I good time until it lasted.
---
What is that supposed to mean
---
Donkey Brains.
---
EXPOSED
---
That's awesome to hear! I will definitely not abandon my lvl 40 hunter in favor of a mage. That thought has bummed me out a lot. I'm mostly in it for the gold to fuel my warrior main.
---
Thank you so much for answering my questions!
---
Lol salty player alert. I’ve never once been tipped more than 1g50s for 6 stacks
---
I'm not even as hardcore as you and I feel the same way. I stay late at the office on Tuesdays to get MC/Ony down and I appreciate efficiency.
---
You're literally just copy/pasting your replies now? What are you after dude? If you dont like your guild, just leave. r/classicwow isn't going to help you.
---
I’m talking to the virtue signaling pearl clutcher.
---
My guild does and it's worked so well!
---
Then leave the guild??? Posting drama on reddit with doctored screenshots just makes you look like a dumbass.
---
If you have a sp at the top of the DPS meters, then something's wrong in terms of them either getting a ton more CDs in terms of innervates and power infusions or just a player issue.       
---
Anyway sub 2 hr MCs aren't like the most absurd thing, at that point it's still if you are trying to get through it. Like there's an alt raid with mages in aoe farming spec, people minimal gear, no consumes / buffs that does it in an hr 45 ish? It's once you start hitting that hr, and sub hr mark where it would matter
---
There's no such thing as a stat prio. The more sp/crit/hit you have the more the other 2 stats are worth relative to the one you increased. The stat ratios change with gear and buffs.
---
Here's the warlock discord where you can find more information on how to gear: https://discord.gg/p2D9Fu
---
Thats your prob. Full mit gear = rage starved. A fury war in leather would have been a better tank
---
After trying it out, that one seems to require a second press to switch stances. As such it doesn't abuse spell batching.
---
Definitely couldn't be farming gold or honor in 2 minutes it takes to conjure your trash ass 120 water.
---
What's that? An average of 2+ gold farmed in 2 minutes in ZF? Hmm I wonder why 2 gold is considered a decent tip for 6 stacks. Because it's the opportunity cost, maybe?
---
If i was GM/officer, id definitely wanna know about this. Pretty scummy.
---
??? We clear as fast as we can with as few people as we can so we can get more loot for the time we spend in MC. How is that concept contradictory? Why are you bragging about sub 2 hr MC for a 40 man? We have a sub 2 hour with 25
---
Ironforge.pro directly reads from the Warcraft logs website... if the guild is updating their fights in there then you should (barring error) show up on ironforge.pro. The census API whit has literally nothing to do with it. 
---
I love the elitist attitude some of you morons on this sub have. Sorry that my reading comprehension isn’t up to your standard. What marks do I receive, a C- ?
---
it will get better over time, but one big issue is these servers started with world instancing, so the initial populations are insane
---
I was going to offer sincere advice as a long time tank, but as this message box opens on my phone it shows me your username... and now I don't feel like it would be doing good.
---
if you pvp a lot invest in regular frost protection/shadow protection pots, helps a lot vs mages and warlocks. esp vs warlocks DoTs that sometimes kill you after u kill the warlock. i personally use(as a warlock) a shitton of LIPs and discombobulator rays, rays are amazing in general for pvp, dismount people, reduce move speed/attack power/spell damage
---
All fun and games until you reach the end and someone mutters the words " escort quest?"  .. then you either accept that slow ass walk to the entrance or leave feeling a piece of shit .
---
Maybe if they just released BGs... 
---
Having 5x the server population really fucks things up for pvp.
---
Where are no GMs to do so probably
---
Do spell cleave groups, 3 mages, 1 lock, 1 priest is ideal.
---
I found it made it a lot more enjoyable because there was always the risk of wiping without a tank.
---
But the alliance rogues are doing this too. It has nothing to do with faction imbalance in this case but rogues abilities. Even on 80-20 servers the rogues on the 20 side can do this and do
---
Imo... find a guild man. Making friends in guilds helps a ton and a lot of people enjoy helping their guilds progress as a whole so they don’t mind it much at all.
---
That’s possible? I have not seen that anywhere
---
As I said, I'm done with you. Continue to be delusional.
---
I mean, no one would use oeb for PvE apart from that ret pally so it makes sense.
---
Im not sure which rings your referring to, ony ring is better than archmagus and ring of spellpower for pvp
---
Lol really? I see Horde groups killing Alliance ALL the time. Just tonight my Onyxia raid got attacked and camped on the boat to Theramore. Horde are extremely active and participating heavily in PvP here. It’s pretty damn even. The Horde experience on Earthfury is NOTHING compared to the Alliance experience on big Horde-dominated PvP sergers.
---
Making 50k dollar a month, he will be able to contribute in the future more than anyone here in their normal shitty jobs.
---
Imagine doing all this work for something that's common knowledge.
---
What do you think the term "contributing factor" means?
---
"enjoyed"
---
Most of us on the subreddit see right through this, but there's some younger and older folks playing this game that could easily be intimidated like this.
---
Report these whenever you see them.
---
Not in my experience, probably about 50-50. Really depends on each persons time constraints.
---
I kinda doubt he's even in the guild tbh and is just trying give someone a bad name.
---
Get someone else to aggro it while you tame
---
because that costs gold..
---
Economy is booming. I rerolled myself, and I'm currently level 32. Easily found a large raiding guild. People questing everywhere.
---
No it doesn't. Source: fully pre-raid BiS warriors w/ all pots/consumes + ony buff was only doing 450-500 before DM dropped. We have like 7 of them in guild since launch.
---
Only now that a few have viskags and can get DM buffs and have several epics do they consistently push that dps, even with the HS queueing abuse to guarantee offhand hits.
---
So win trading, nice
---
Genius. Why didn't they think of this? Give this man a nobel prize
---
Some people take "PVP" to mean "I've decided that because I want to PVP you don't get to play the game today. Fuck you." And then wonder why the wow community is considered one of the most toxic.
---
if i was the leader i would find out who you are and kick you asap. you seem to be the problem and clearly are trying to cause an issue. in addition you have been caught in a lie before and anything else you write is not going to believed.
---
Excuse me what
---
Demons, evil spirits, same same.
---
Are they supposed to enjoy wasting more time in MC for no apparent reason? Boy guys we sure had fun today! We only wasted 2x as much of our time.
---
And you keep on pretending you don't need a pvp crutch. See now we're both in fantasy land!
---
Well why would we know the trial time in YOUR guild??? Maybe take control of your life and find your own guild that suits you.
---
Lol no Sulfuras and Archmagus rings are better by a landslide. What u smoking. Resists are huge for PvP and 23 int on a ring is super impactful.
---
the 8/8 set bonus is too strong. iirc hunters won't equip any t2 in raids until they get all 8 pieces and will switch out. ony always dropped t2 helms as far as I know.
---
Any normal person experiencing what they try to paint would just deal with it, not post about it on reddit.
---
The fact that they are either means they are just drama fishing or they are leaving parts out.
---
The amount of people like him on here is actually scary though. There was an article linked on the CS:GO website a while ago interviewing cheaters. The hackers just legitimately thought they were better players then the people they were killing WHILE THEY WERE CHEATING, it’s insane the limited awareness people have, there are so many narcissists in online gaming communities it’s legitimately scary.
---
This is basically Win trading. Just sad individuals
---
52 Druid, so its not like my stealth actually hides me in those small corridors
---
1. do you have a guild? find a dad guild that will help you learn instances. i learned a lot of instances by fucking up pulls and wiping groups. don't tell them you're unfamiliar with stuff, just read a little about them and figure shit out. ask people once you're INSIDE the instance if you need clarification.
---
2. deep prot for tanking instances  (DO NOT GET IMPALE). plz get imp revenge. you'll thank me later. i can give you a build if you want. if you want actual advice for what buttons to press i can give you that too.
---
3. do you want to tank or do you want to DPS? i always tank on newer servers because its easier to get gear and you can just not invite other plate. you also can reserve righteous orbs or get certain tank benefits depending on the group. if you just want to DPS, go fury and DPS groups. it may be harder to get groups, but if you DPS for a week or two and learn the instances, then maybe you'll have the confidence to go tank them.
---
4. especially with wpvp, i'd go epic mount first. what weapons are you talking about buying? if you are going to spend any money on gear, it should be towards lionhearts helmet, not weapons.
---
You might be able to find a nice read on Icyveins or Wowhead. I can give you a quick TLDR though, if you're interested: The talents Flurry and Deathwish. The reason Fury only really stands out endgame is because the tree is geared towards dualwielding and therefore really benefits from the increased hit % brought by endgame gear. Hit more, get more crits, procs more Flurry, which lets you hit more... you get the idea.
---
Lmao yikes it couldn't have more clearly been a joke
---
I mean it was all cleared up before you said anything at all. So yeah man, we good. Lol.
---
i mean i'm not saying its impossible to make 100g/hr, i made well over that farming devilsaur myself, but he was making it seem like it was easy for warlocks to farm 100g/hr and that most/all warlocks can do it and are doing it, which is just straight up wrong and exaggerating to try and make his other point seem worse.
---
Respeccing talents isnt nessesary for tanking.  Gear is needed.
---
Let me explain how aggro works:
---
1 dmg = 1 threat
---
1 heal = 1 threat split by the amount of enemys ( means 5 enemys = 0,2 threat on each)
---
1 taunt = catapult on top of threat list
---
Your job as a tank is keeping aggro away from the healer, cause every hit interupts the casting time. Its impossible to cast with 3+ autohits on the healer.
---
To keep aggro above your healer (since his threat is split by enemy count) it should be enough to demo shout and swipe.
---
To keep aggro above the DPS players, you simple have to taunt - whats only possible if they focus on a single target.
---
Its impossible to hold aggro if you start a fight with 0 rage, but the rogues just nukes his 100 energy and 5 combos. I recommend a hotkey for "skull mark" on target, so all dps focus one and you can taunt above.
---
If every DPS player picks his own target, you simply cant hold the aggro with a 10sec taunt cooldown, let them do, let them die - the healer will tell them to stop taking triple dmg as the tank.
---
Respeccing only gives a dmg boost, whats not bad for generating threat - but not enough to keep threat over a real DPS nuking all his shit - so you anyway taunt.
---
Gear on the other side, should be for tanking. HP and specially Armor helps alot to stay alive. Specially if multi-enemys hitting you, its really neat to reduce every single hit.
---
The game isnt so tight balanced or difficult that you need every single talentpoint and gearslot best possible to beat a dungeon or raid.
---
Iirc librams / shoulder enchants (I don't remember about shoulders tbh) count towards the buff limit. They said it in one of the posts that I can't be bothered to find again. I don't think any other enchants should count towards it anymore though, and the limits 32 or something along those lines. Something they also mentioned
---
As I previously stated, I don't. I hardly pay attention to the cast bar, but when I do it's nice to see it easier. If you consider that a crutch.. I don't know how to help you. Clearly you think that thousands need said crutch. I think you're making a big deal out of nothing.
---
Getting killed in pvp?  Just stop dying.  Easy fix.
---
So why people are still complaining? Look at those other posts! It's like they are surprised to be ganked and have no idea what they should do except to report the players to Blizzard.
---
Sure you can have a headcanon and your own ideas, but WoW is not based on that nor does it take your preconceived notions of what a warlock is into account. Warlocks definitely use shadow magic in WoW and they are arguably the best at it. And in the case of warlocks when they say shadow they mean shadow magic. 
---
And using your same logic of shadow meaning different things, can't warlock be the same? A WoW warlock can be it's own conceptual ideation of a warlock that is not the same as a typical mythological warlock.
---
AQ gates auto complete after a certain period of time.
---
But they'll probably be asshurt that they have to wait that long.
---
Even at level 46 when I’m full specced into imp drain life? Shadowbolt takes forever to cast and if I’m lucky enough to get a crit it’s like 300ish. Plus, most of the time my healers are oom because the rest of the group is a shitshow.. I’d rather they save those heals for people who need them. I top the charts at my level on virtually every run, except when Mages AoE, so I’m not worried about my dps as much as the group’s survivability. Deaths take way more time than the possible increase in dps I would produce. Exp/hour is what it’s all about, and wipes destroy groups.
---
Edit: I basically never need heals.
---
You could always learn to breathe through your nose
---
I do not know, but I would assume it shows the paper crit chance and not a mob specific crit chance.
---
Have to agree with you on that. I fucking hate when ppl like this guy start using pseudo-math and statistics in a deceiving manner and front them as facts. It's disrespectful!
---
PVE servers have wpvp too, just here when we get tired of it we go somewhere safe, unflag and go about our business without having to worry about some jerkoff deciding their need to PVP is more important than someone else getting to actually play.  And then when we feel the need to PVP again we flag and go at it.
---
Its ok to go afk for urgent stuff or even leave the party, but please announce it! "AFK 10 min, wife aggro" "AFK, 2 MIN, TOILET" Etc.
---
They are entitled to the money if they can get it. Warriors aren’t cursed to make less money just because they rolled warrior. If other classes can farm exorbitant amounts of gold then warriors are entitled to use that as a basis for how much they charge for tanking. Warriors aren’t entitled to access to solo farming methods, and every other class certainly isn’t entitled to having a tank for end game dungeons.
---
You keep spouting bullshit about warriors pitying themselves when it sounds like you pity yourself for the fact that you might have to pay someday to get a tank for a dungeon.
---
So u’ll have a bunch of 59s twinked doing the same shit
---
there have been 2-5 rogues in IF on Kromcrush every day since PVP started, normally 2-3 in the mystic are killing people as they mage port in. sometimes they kill in the inn, and one of them will just kill a random person in the middle of the pile between the bank and the AH and the get killed, rez and do it again, all day, every day
---
to play devils advocate, how much honor do they realistically get with DR?
---
This isn't anything compared to whats going to happen in WSG where the premades will just round robin wins against each other if they happen to queue into
---
You're wrong, and dumb.
---
Both.
---
Lol I have about 5 alts, most are hiding in inns because I can’t fly out of the zone.
---
I just want to make Horde tryhards mad. No other real reason for me to go Alliance.
---
That’s pretty ineffective. 
---
Instead of trying to quash the conversation, try offering something valuable, or ignore it and move on.
---
faerlina? Doing scummy twitch like collaberation stuff? no it can't be
---
is this possible? is it possible to have a good healer priest spec'd for shadow weaving and still give good heals?
---
I see so many people who argue that servers are the same population or maybe 20% larger. It's laughable. Anyone who doesn't understand that servers are massively more populated either didn't play vanilla or is being intellectually dishonest. Because that shit is so obvious.
---
Ahh man, i would explode if that happend to me.
---
It might be a situation that \*you\* see a lot less, if you're the Warlock. As the healer, I very rarely see myself let people die because I'm having an ego trip.
---
Use ublock origins. They run a very aggressive ad system that eats memory and will eventually crash your browser.
---
Level 47 is the brand new wpvp twink bracket.
---
Honor from murdering low 50's is bonkers.
---
Also, the very fact that there are 10k players on a server that had a 3k cap in vanilla IS a massive change so gtfo with the “no changes” crap.
---
yes, as most game related info-sites - it makes money by loading a lots of Ads in the background.
---
Just close after you got your info.
---
If its the mob i think ir is. I killed it once on my rogue. An addon told me it was a rare.
---
He droped no loot(not even money) 
---
But he respamed really fast. 1min or less
---
He made this post on r/arugal a week ago, but hes still posting the cropped version for drama.
---
it would kill guilds left and right, I don't think people understand what it means by putting half the horde into a queue. Imagine half your raid team is stuck on a 6 hour queue at 7pm
---
I just want you to know all servers are different. I play on Sulfuras and we have multiboxers who camp and mass res and goblin snapper blast wave to wipe raids.  This stuff happens everywhere. I am sorry for how it is though.
---
So let me get this straight.. your suggestion is for alliance players, from about level 30 onward, to pay 1g~ every time they want to change continents? Alliance are quitting the game already because of how much more time they have to spend as compared to horde, so you should come up with a better solution or sit back
---
The simple solution is to just spend the money to host 3x the number of servers. Suddenly it would be like vanilla again.
---
It's because of the AOE ground pound. Seriously the most cancerous instance. Farm corpsemaker for all your warrior and shaman friends and never finish the rest. Back to SM.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=16096/steamwheedle-bruiser
---
What are you trolling for?
---
I like where you purposely clip out the guards.
---
Grats!!! im a similar situation with wife and kids and can't wait to hit 60...o yeah and im Alliance so its going to be a while
---
I wish I was playing alliance... Just my favorite class is Shaman...
---
Leveling up my second one as I write this.
---
Wrong, wrong, wrong. Yes, vanilla had pvp. No, it was NOT 100 million to 1 like it is now. The only significant groups I EVER ran into was at BRM, the place with 2 dungeon and 2 raid entrances. What we have now is significant numbers at damn near every single significant spot for exp in the game from level 40+ all the way to 60. 
---
Blow me. It was NOT always like this. You sir, are lying.
---
they last a half an hour or until you run out of charges (procs)
---
In a similar vein, shouldn't reflectors make you immune to aoe? Currently they simply do nothing.
---
If you say so, mate.
---
You trying to protect your bot farm or something? Contribute or move on.
---
What fo you mean? Every class is needed in a competitive guild. Sure, there's not many druid spots but you 
---
 need them too. You can be the star of wsg at worst. 
---
Also you forgot warrior, the ultimate tryhard class.
---
I have been having a great time taking as a bear, level 60 now and working on my BiS. Everything I learned is from SkarmTank. He's got some great videos on YouTube if you want. As for respecing: some of the tank talents are really important to help with survivability since we don't have defensive cooldowns and our mitigation is only from armor and dodge. That being said, it shouldn't be necessary for the dungeons you can run right now. Give it a try, and if you like it you can make like easier on your healer by grabbing some of the mitigation talents.
---
As for gear, keep your eyes out for any "... of the monkey" pieces, and especially upgrades in armor since those scale incredibly well with Dire Bear form. Happy tanking!
---
Most estimations agree that the world was built for 3k concurrent players, with a good proportion of them being below level 60. I'm seeing a lot more than that just level 60 at peak times. They simply need to make more servers and offer guild xfers etc. But blizzard doesn't want to spend money.
---
&gt;contribute
---
LMAO
---
You mean like this thread did?
---
Living the Yojamba dream
---
Much better than joining a dkp raiding guild and waiting 3-5 weeks for a piece of loot.
---
I agree with this guy. This is server/community politics. Some guilds choose not to fight one another, that's part of the game.
---
Exactly why I unsubbed until p3.  No point in playing Classic if you’re below lvl 60 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
hello fellow krom friend you are correct 
---
last night there was a 40 man raid on the UBRS balcony, was fun times. 9 of our ubrs group ran from lakeshire. they made it to the door on that side and then began corpse hopping
---
The no changes thing is legit stupid as fuck. They are plenty of changes that have and will happen. This isn't vanilla. 
---
Blizzard should follow jagex and put polls into the game and allow the majority to decide the date of classic/ tbc/ wotlk.
---
Ya know what happened to vanilla and it's no changes? It turned into retail..
---
False. STV is worth it in the morning.
---
Seriously some of you to need to log out now and then. It’s a game. If it pisses you off you should find a new pastime
---
80% of oceania is on arugal as well as most frequent players, the rest are irrelevant
---
It's because of faction imbalances, the horde racials, leveling quest, city locations and zeppelin locations are much better compared to anything alliance has.
---
&gt; As far as the fast/slow debate slower is undeniably better in vanilla because there was no weapon power normalization.
---
Weapon power was normalized from day one for white attacks - you get +1 dps for every 14 attack power without regard for weapon speed or weapon damage. In 1.7 or 1.8 (i.e. before Classic patch), it became semi-normalized for special attacks. So, yes, slower was better - but only for special attacks. The only special attack Shaman get is Stormstrike.
---
&gt; I've also heard (unreliable source) that there was internal weapon cooldowns that wouldn't allow WF to proc any faster than every two seconds.
---
The internal cooldown was added much later. However, it's not terribly relevant since Shaman who primarily deal damage via melee use 2-handed weapons (which are never very fast). It's only the spellpower-focused Shaman who use one-handed daggers (and they want as fast as possible because the spellpower component of Flametongue is not normalized to weapon speed).
---
It has nothing to do with White Knighting. I just played vanilla so bugs and unpolished gameplay is normal for veterans, they don't get worked up. It takes a special kind of manchild to ask people to leave their families on thanksgiving weekend to fix a small bug in a video game. Oof.
---
Ya they'd transfer
---
There was no incentive to quite at 60/40, letting it devolve to 80/20 increases people quitting. He obviously wasn't suggesting what you're asserting, don't be disingenuous.
---
Not sure if it’s from an add on or not honestly but my Shadow Bolt button gets a little glittery border around it.
---
Why a sword?
---
Would only take a dagger for faster attackspeed and more proccs of enchants - if not take an axe as orc.
---
lol they sit there for hours dude. i actually got bored today and watched it happen when i was watching redzone
---
kromkrush is not that lopsided on pop
---
That's not on the zeppelin, that's on the tower they dock on to.
---
Ya i can't play at normal hours so leveling is something I can do all the time. Harder to get to raids and dungeons.
---
There is no opportunity cost for fucks sake. You don't play the game constantly killing shit. Terrible argument. Its the opportunity cost between helping someone out or scratching your ass in Ironforge.
---
2 gold for clicking a spell a few times? Are you mental? Its not "considered a decent tip" at all. Your opinion is not fact.
---
Just a someone helping out. Before phase2's KoS mentality that was pretty normal. Not special at all.
---
It's good to see that much like the average high school bully, When you have been defeated on the subject. You revert to random insults. If I was there standing next to you now. I'm sure the next thing would be physical violence. That's how dummies work. 
---
Honestly, I'm probably old enough to be your dad. lol
---
Silly zoomer kiddies.
---
Depends on which time zone though.
---
Wow thanks bro! Appreciate the awesome write up! I’m guessing the mining RTV step is the same time I’d herb?
---
Me too man, me too
---
see i like the large pop, i like the convenience of have a larger pool of people LFG, full major cities the rustle and bustle i think its awesome but goodnight trying to quest or herb or mine or god forbid you have to go to BRM with the honor system and with these large pops....layering allowed the convenience of access to large pools of people and large cities but also still an expansive open world.....im obviously bias and want my idea to work lol
---
So lvl my alts to 59 for farming and try not to lvl
---
I'm not even that hardcore, just figured that I have limited playtime and I better set goals and plan how to achieve them. I did take some PTO to level a farm alt to 60 and farmed ZF for 2 days at 14 hours/day to set my foundation but one you have a decent chunk of gold it's really easy to grow it on the AH. Legit I've played 6 hours a week for the last month
---
I don't want to see gnomes standing on 2 legs ... the only way i can tolerate them is if they are on the ground lifeless
---
As a classic priest this is so on point!!!! I literally have to pep talk the locks before the raid!
---
The guards spawn right in front of the zep, while there are no guards on it, the ones that spawn right in front of it will chase you onto the zep if you aggro them
---
Shaman need that shit for burst healing!
---
Lol I literally just did this twice - once off the coast of Deso and one in the water next to Stromgarde Keep. Still got camped.
---
Id pay 100$ to reroll. Game isn't fun anymore.
---
It's not, none o these people are going to get high rank, and once they realize the effort it requires to get high rank they will quit. 
---
Additionally these people are dogshit at the game most of the time, i've literally 1v2 camped some of these people on the boat before.
---
Blizz warned you
---
Saw a guy named Poosniff trying to get someone to help him gank a priest named Felate. Legit playing with 12 year olds, it’s fucking embarrassing
---
Murlocs are the number one mage aoe spot for that level and heavily farmed. The whole water side is impossible to grind. 
---
So are the spiders. And anything close to Tabetha is camped all the time.
---
As an meme spec sham, I don't see how the other casters are doing twice your deeps. The only time i fall ofd the meters is if i switch to healing mid fight
---
Fuck me, old mate needs to step back for a bit and relax.
---
It doesnt count for your wand. Thought the same thing with Frost on my mage. Had a wand with frost damage
---
Dude stalagg isn't bad. It would be even better if more allies came. A bunch left because of the queues and now heart seeker is fucked. Stalagg is alright because grizzly and fusion exist and they bolster the rest. I'm horde and we have good fights throughout the world, BRM those two guilds hold it down often.
---
It so complicated no one can understand it.  I've had like 5 people explain it, and I dont even remember.  Just sounded like a mix of dkp and suicide kings or something.
---
It’s weird. I think the fast pace of retail and other games is responsible. Back in vanilla I loved tanking scholo. We used the crap out of cc and I los pulled and people gave me a damn second. Things pretty much never went poorly. Now people frequently die in the groups I’m a dps in because they light up off target mobs and no one uses cc. Hell scholo and strat are perfect for bored priests and I’ve had tanks tell them not to shackle.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
It's just people being dickbags because they can. They take the "war" too serious and since there's no repercussions why not?  It's the epitome of selfishness to let your desire to PVP prevent someone else from even playing. You'll find the typical shithead responses hurr durr roll pve, red=dead, PVP isn't for you, etc. And that kind of shows the mindset of some people.  They don't care about your fun, only their own.
---
Smite HAHAHAHAHA i stopped buying ranks for that ages ago
---
When a peon somehow hits level 60...
---
Server imbalances are being caused by Big Mage to force people to buy their portal services.
---
Get rid of spy and honour spy.
---
Some guilds will prioritize big items(like Mageblade) for good specs, but allow meme specs to roll on the non-bis epics.
---
Obviously but the premise of cost vs reward is still valid. I was just using them as an analogy
---
2 Examples
---
DM:East Jump runs are doable as prot within 12 minutes with a shaman in any specc really. I personally did it with a resto shaman and an enhancement shaman. Might be doable with other heal classes, but i didnt try it. You are almost as fast as an arms warrior (as your mates can spend a lot more time dealing damage) and are still faster than the lockout time. This method will yield around 50g/hr if you have mining and herbalism in your group.
---
3 man Eye of Shadow farming in Winterspring. Now that depends on your server economy and maybe open world population, but on my server these go for around 300g and the demons are fairly unoccupied. Take a (non-mana) DPS and a healer with you and you will make around 50g-70g/hr. In my personal experience going with a tank is the most efficient eyefarming setup as you can still pull 2-3 mobs, but you are only splitting gold 3-ways. (Dont kill the Dogs, they dont drop the Eye).
---
The best ways of making gold are things you can only do in a group and sometimes i feel kind of lost when my buddys arent online, but if you can find mates that will farm for several hours you are good to go.
---
If you are not using a flask you are paying 50g maximum for a raid which isnt too much considering its only once per week. Sure, your repair bills are higher, but lets be honest. Your gear is almost never completely broken and repair bills are at least covered by random stuff that drops in instances even when its not locked.
---
Edit: I dont want this to sound like warriors are good at making gold. Warriors are dogshit, but there is still stuff you can do. And i guess its kinda the mindset of players that are thinking they are the ones that should tank 37-39 other players through a raid, but i always see tanks (including myself) using every reasonable consumable available, so you are spending alot more money. Additionally there are a lot of BoEs you can buy as a warrior which is also heavy on your wallet. So yeah, tanks are short on money and selling tanking services is a reasonable (if not the best) source of gold
---
yeah but not if your casting smite HAHAHAHHAA
---
Awesome luck! I’m on my 40th something dedicated HoJ run with at least a dozen other runs through BRD before that included an Anger kill.
---
Vuhdo is in classic wow?
---
As I said, I would do it differently. I personally don't really care for people who don't try to improve. I only write them when I see them actually expressing a want to become part of the raid. If you don't care about it, I won't care about you.
---
Its not elitsm. You’ll pull a ton of extra stuff and make the run way harder than it needs to be. For example you’ll pull the citizens running up the ramp to arena probably wiping the group. Scholos an absolute nightmare with low levels so is strat
---
It is even more not worth it these days when different faction camp dungeon entrance for hours. You will spend half a hour to corpse hop to the entrance then another hour to clear a dungeon with questional skilled players.
---
I truthfully don't know how long it takes. Theres also the possibility of Horde using the black market AH to funnel mats to Alliance.
---
I don't think it'll be that big of a deal. Maybe set them back a week or so tops. Probably still make em upset.
---
this works for clearcasting too
---
SP dps is at its peak right now. Fights are short and with PvP blues, they can do decently.
---
SP problem is they don't scale into later content well.
---
So this is the face of classic cancer
---
I personally believe you are clearing it that fast because of the other players using consumables, but who knows.
---
Was actually thinking IF there was a similiar addon for PVE while farming the other day. Sure hope we get some answers
---
Arcane/frost with about 330 spell power + 35 spell power pot + ony buff and 2x talisman procs. We spread out to avoid the knock up explosions. I used a mana gem + robe of archmage for mana before we finally downed him first phase. I do not have a raid weapon, if I did my spell power would be around 390.
---
You sir are a legend  Thanks so much, exactly the sort of thing i was after.  If i had 10 upvotes to give you i would :)
---
If you take 5 minutes to learn under city it's the best city. Unless you're talking about cosmetic design which means nothing.
---
&gt;  You can fluidly level up on alliance side through questing with minimum grinding, horde it’s like a level grind every 4th level the entire way to 60, is not every 3rd due to shitty quests. Just look at the areas, they are barren (no pun intended) and flat with hardly any verticality compared to any of the alliance areas. Horde quests pick up around 25-35+ depending on your pathing, and only because they go into contested zones where alliance also have hubs so the zones were tailored already.
---
You definitely can't, I've leveled both alliance and horde and you need to dungeon grind for a good portion of levels or grind period. You can get to 12-13 without even leaving tirisfal. You can do every quest in Elwynn and you'd be lucky to hit 11. I didn't even mention that you can get  to the mid 40's without even leaving a horde zone. The quest lore is way more in depth but you still need to grind or dungeon.
---
Use guilds discord
---
Hey screw you man, I’ll 1v1 you any day
---
That concept is a functionality in the addon [Puggle.](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25281-Puggle.html)
---
Why aren't you using the DM east back door north of Camp Mojache, strip naked, die, and run to the DM instance of your choice without 'fear' of pvp?
---
Use your brain.
---
I mean 3% crit really isn't that much.  It's less than 1% dmg increase, so multiply that by 4 people, and your buff adds about 12% of a mage.  Is the boomkin doing the other 88% to earn his spot?  Seriously doubt it.
---
“Because honestly, If your reading comprehension is worse then a 12-year-old, then I don't want to have a conversation with you.” - sohappyred
---
Geez you are so old your memory is going, it’s sad to see. Probably why you can’t remember how ironforge.pro works and you keep yapping on about the census addon.
---
Edit: bored at work so I went through your comments, holy fuck. You’ve already had this argument with several other people and been shut down every time. You also use the exact same insults and then try to use the bully line! God damn you are a loser.
---
Naw dude, everyone gets free waters, 120 of them if they catch me in Org and ask nicely. If you try to tip 20s or something dumb like that I just give you the tip back because you obviously actually need the money
---
You should still be able to press it rapidly to get the same result.
---
Does he have freezing band?
---
This is happening against horde too on kromkush.
---
it still takes ages to even form a group on a 5 minute chat delay.
---
I think youre noticing it more because there is such a high number of players, groups in vanilla would take a lower level because thats all that was available. Now they can be picky cause a 60 will eventually become available
---
This is true. I haven't seen it myself but apparently a blue post confirmed that it's "worked as intended" and "not a glitch". Basically as long as it's queue'd your attacks follow the ability (yellow) hitcap and not the normal (white) hitcap. 
---
Not too sure on the canceling part.
---
Most guilds that care enough to use EPGP just do loot council instead.
---
Just a tip for anyone.  It's faster to run into the side entrance and then just die inside.
---
You can then run as a ghost into any DM instance since they are all connected.
---
Theres no chat delay on your servers discord/guild discord
---
Would like some videos
---
We have lists in our guild for consumables necessary for bonus DKP.
---
For a rogue that is for example on a farm raid to have Mongoose up. For mages, Warlocks and Shadows it is greater Arcane Elixir. 
---
On progress raids we have higher requirements.
---
Yeah, about 90 seconds if you have evocate up. It's really not a big deal, usually I just give 120 waters with no expectation of a tip unless I'm busy.
---
Except for those people that RP talk at me to ask for water. You don't get water, find a different server for that lmao
---
Tank and start the BRD groups - advertise as xp farms.
---
It's probably not to farm, just to be dicks
---
Doesn't happen on Incendius.
---
Many casters will continue to use talisman and ring of spell power well into AQ or even naxx. And guilds are about mindsets, you dont set thes policy early you will lose the better players
---
How?  It's so easy to get hit capped as a hunter.  On my troll hunter, I can get hit capped with a bow, a scope, and a talent.  Literally 0% hit on gear, and I'll be capped.  This guy was a female tauren, but even still you have a lot of options for hit.
---
Join a guild/make friends.. you'll get a group no problem.
---
edit: we have shadow priests and ret pally's in my guild and clear MC no problem every week... this elitist bullshit is just a fairy tale.
---
Maybe give them a warning or two then let them die. Or suck it up and heal them if it isn't making you wipe due to OOM.
---
Best case just try to stick to guild runs when you can.
---
If your healer is drinking, you should be drinking/eating. Easy.
---
After seeing how most of the horde talk in the Skeram server discord i can pretty safely say that blizzard arent all to blame.  These people are subhumans.
---
Need to have a good conversation with the group on how to play. Warriors need to be hit to generate rage. Without rage they can't hold agro. If the DPS are preventing this from happening, they'll never get it back. 
---
In the short term, not healing works but then you're going to end up with a tank with several mobs on them without any damage being done.
---
Thank you! Never thought to hotkey 💀
---
They  do... you just have no idea how difficult it is to find all bots. You can maybe find one or two... not the reality, which is probably thousands and increasing all the time.
---
Its the same battle as crime in  real life...  we have had laws for a long ass time yet people still break them.
---
Health pots and mana pots seems to be selling. You could also check on Free action potions, living action potions, swiftness potion, anti venom potions.
---
Note on my server the herbs are worth more than making the potions. So i just sell them instead.
---
half raid team transferring is not better either, assuming they dont just quit. This will also severely kill off server pop
---
EPGP and DKP are pretty much the same. EPGP has a built-in decay of points, but DKP can support that too.  DKP can also support initial gear levels by setting initial DKP to non-zero.
---
The main difference is that EPGP stresses effort in its description.  But DKP is easy to modify; income doesn't need to be strictly from gear being acquired.
---
Herods is one of the more balanced servers. No one has uploaded in the last 4 days... please use the ironforge site it’s way more accurate. This frustrating too see this misinformation because it causes more people to believe the 25:75 meme when in fact it’s 40:60.
---
People need to think long term herod has 7.5k pop and when the war effort begins you want to be on the highest populated server to be the first to open the gates. Smaller servers will probably have to wait a month or more then the mega servers. Even naxx could be scratched off because post BWL is when the player pop tanks hard. We’re nearing the glory days of classic. Before you know it guilds will struggle to recruit meaningful players because of the drop off. guilds canabilize each other until there’s nothing left. Ask yourself before transferring away do you want to be playing on the stalaggs and skerams for a brief relief. Most people regret transferring away because the other realms are already starting to die.
---
Herod has the 3rd highest alliance pop when it comes to pvp servers the first being heartseeker and whitemane. We have more alliance then faerlina. So consider the other alliance players you’re leaving behind. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side.
---
Without taking away from the larger point that yes, Phase 2 has turned unbalanced PvP servers into unfun hellzones.... This *specifically* isn't strictly a server balance problem. It's a rogue problem. Grobbulus is near as makes no difference 50/50, and most days this week alliance rogues have been camping the road from The Bulwark to the UC elevator. If you're riding in alone from the Plaguelands, you've got about a 30% chance of getting stunlocked and corpse camped until you can get into the city proper.
---
The OG rogue as a class is a near-perfect griefing machine, and I suspect the fundamental structure of the WoW universe is tightly-packed rogues in stealth.
---
Just get a lvl 5 enchanter to DE everything.
---
Anytime I've ran strat or scholo with underlevled pugs it's always either a total disaster, or takes way longer than it needs to.
---
People want to get in, pray for their loot, and in to the next one. They're not there to help you level...
---
Yeah I agree with your conclusion that this isn’t honor trading, though it definitely is unintended cross-faction  collusion imo.
---
What's a naga player
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true 
---
Don't think so...
---
No one has any PvP blues currently though. And it wouldn't be much reason to handicap your raid for what 3 to 4 months, if you care about how much time you spend during a raid.        
---
The other thing is that looking at Warcraft logs completely says something opposite about SPs more or less, for them to be worthwhile to bring over a mage or lock
---
So I have a funny story about something like that.
---
On Skalag one of my buddies was having horde trouble so my friend and I head out to tanaris to help him out. We got wiped by a 60 squad a few times so my buddy hits up chat asking the local 60s in the zone for help.
---
This one Alliance 60 named Digb got annoyed and told us that he was going to bring his 60 over to kill us. We didn't believe him at all so we started joking at his expense. Anyways about 25 minutes and a few more threats from Dibg later..
---
A raid geared 60 priest named Spear dive bombs us. Which we owned, like no contest lol a 50, 49, and 45 lol. So then Dibg gets really butt hurt in chat giving all these excuses like it was a discipline priest. Lol. Eventually we disband and I log out. After that Spear spawn killed my buddy a few times. Then hunted down my other buddy who was helping another player in Feralas and making alts to private message him nasty messages.
---
So we report him to blizzard who told us we provoked him... Rofl
---
TLDR; Don't ask other players for help. And Dibg/Spear has some serious IRL social issues.
---
but it isnt... almost all bots are hunters, because hunter is the easiest class to play. Even easier than warlock.
---
Reroll horde duh. You’re only 39, more than half of the leveling is still ahead of you and far more of the overall content is ahead of you.
---
I think that's more so me being a spaz :P
---
I've resorted to waiting until BGs come out to farm thorium. Sucks cuz I just wanna make my own bullets instead of having to buy them.
---
You can farm mithril and ghost mushrooms in Mara for some gold.
---
Lookingforgroup is the global channel for finding group. I have seem that a lot of new player did not realize/know the channel. There is also world channel but it is player made channel. Another thing is started making friend from previous run
---
Hinterlands, or southern stv has some quests if you haven’t already finished them
---
Actually, just go hinterlands, the elite troll quests have RIDONKULOUS rewards for you - need a 5 man group and 2 hours
---
Tailoring is pointless till lvl 60. Just save your money up, look up a materials list and then afk it in a few hours once you need to craft truefaith/Archmage/the lock one and then drop it till zg.
---
That website is using flawed information. It only gathers from Warcraft logs and some census addon (that doesn't work because of fundamental changes to Blizzards API) 
---
Warcraft logs only have information available from guilds who participate in PVE raids. There are far too many guilds that are PVP based or don't upload at all. Honestly, someone needs to create a thread to let people know to stop quoting that site.
---
Was this on ashkandi? Think I saw this in lfg a couple days ago.
---
Lose the loot whores that cause drama, and bail the second you wipe on a boss.
---
Lol dps selling their services. Some dumb rogue once started mouthing off at the healer about selling his dps because we wouldn't let him have the content of locked chest.
---
Know what happened? We kicked him and he was replaced within a minute. Why? Because dps'ers are a dime a dozen and I actually care about the healer rather than any of the 3 mouth breathers.
---
The laggy clusterfucks \*are\* the actual PvP. There won't ever be a time when it's different.  
---
I'm in a guild on a Horde-heavy PvP server, and a lot of people are doing pretty well for honor, but we have to swap zones pretty often because after a couple minutes of 10v10 combat, close to a hundred Horde summon/fly in and lock the zone down.
---
That's frustrating. Not sure why it says it increases my ranged attack on character screen, then. Would've been a strong ass wand..
---
I feel like one important thing in how classic fits is. The factions basically just formed. This is why everything is so fucked, the world is essentially in anarchy. The progression of WoW shows how the governments take more and more control.  Infrastructure gets better, factions join them, armies become bigger, technology evolves.
---
No they dont tho.  How do we know how much money they  have available to spend on bot-fight? the money has to come from somewhere...  if they  spend it all against bots then every other development suffers from it.
---
I say we the fans all blitz to have blizzard iincorporate first free realm tranfers. Open a ticket or a suggestion to the devs asking them for transfers. After enough players demand it they will surely offer it to as a good business practice.
---
The main thing to keep in mind is feral gets 2AP per point of strength, but 1AP per point of agility, so when you play cat form you want to stack strength over agility.
---
This is the opposite for bear, because you want the agility for dodge, so stack agility for bear form. Otherwise the builds should be mostly the same.
---
100 to 0 fuckin pussy won't even get a hit on me
---
I’d say join a raid with composition and loot rules you’re ok with and then don’t complain about it after the fact.
---
Yeah someone told me about this. Do you leave the funnies where there are a lot of mobs or something so they break faster?
---
Idk what you expected signing up for PVP server as Alliance. They published the content schedule ahead of time
---
I dunno, if you actually wore the full t1 maybe you had too little aggro. 
---
You don't need much mitigation gear in dungeons, I easily tank them in pvp-ish gear as fury. It depends on the healer ofc, but my last run with a holy priest friend in blues I even tanked the abominations and ramstein in strat ud while dual wielding for fun. The boss was the only problem and we almost ran out of mana but other than that I was pullling abominations constantly.
---
My main struggle has been keeping aggro on packs of enemies with randoms, rogues pulling w/o evasion is the biggest draim on healer mana I've seen so far.
---
Edit: welp, just noticed the bit where they were casting smite again,maybe they were just terrible.
---
If you really want to optimize it, if everyone has 2 alts then you can run 10 mains + 20 alts in splitraids. 30 People are enough to do MC if you have enough decently geared people.  The mainraid will be full epic after a few weeks.
---
Damnnnnn, she plays retail? RIP
---
Which ally dominated server do you speak of?
---
The data is only from players who have their census addon installed.  Explains why every server appears to be 50/50.
---
He's not necessarily trolling, some people are just complete tools.
---
&gt; If they're all in the same discord calling out information for the opposite faction?
---
how could one ever find proof of something like this? let alone info on what they were talking about?
---
Buy cheap light leather and craft lvl 10ish greens for everyone's alts. Probably similar for cloth.
---
Since your claim is easily verifiable (horde encampments are indeed central in 90% of the contested zones while alliance ones are mostly as remote as possible or even missing) You're arguing with either some mouthbreather with a roomtemperature IQ or a troll. Its really not worth replying in either case.
---
Chrom cloak is better for pvp because of the stam. For pve it’s basically a sidegrade, as 1 crit and 14 spell power are relatively equal in value.
---
Of course not, but dealing with one wave likely consisting of likely 5-6 bots used by 90% of the botters doesn't take 6 months.
---
The originally post I responded to was one wave/signatureset not all bots. People just misunderstood..
---
CC type and DR category are different things.
---
&gt;*never worth it*
---
Then don't complain?
---
Following for 15 months, not subbed for 15 months.
---
There are also far more fully geared 60s with epic mounts now than there were back then.
---
Worked up? Nar man. It's fun disproving silly chaps like yourself and /u/Stiryx
---
Edit: Oh you're horde? That very much reinforces that you're sprouting propaganda. Because the status quo 100% favors you. Honestly, No Horde deserves an opinion on this. 
---
Horde players (for the most part) don't have the relevant experiences in game to have an unbiased opinion. You can keep going on about how there is no faction inbalance all you want. You're allowed an opinon. Even if it is wrong.
---
Did you do a good job worth taking you over someone else applying? If yes you wouldn't be a trial, if no request why you aren't a raider and improve
---
&gt;*9 people*
---
Mmmm, tasty hyperbole...
---
The twitch app is by far the fastest way to add any addons now its great i use it. I used to do it manually and was sceptical about it but it works amazingly!
---
I won it my first night in MC as a priest.  I joined that guild to spare their feelings. 😈
---
Retail? Yuck have fun
---
You only get to server transfer off full servers
---
Bald man bad
---
Then bid what you want and take all the gear nobody is willing to spend DKP on? All the system you’re using encourages is for those high in DKP to get everything they want before everyone else. Let them have their mageblade while you rock every other bit of gear you want and do more damage than them anyway.
---
Our guild specifically bans DKP collusion but doesn’t actually enforce it or whatever... basically means if you want to try and make deals with other raiders you can, but we’re not enforcing them and we’re not listening to you cry if they don’t play along.
---
Dps warriors are the least desired role in 5 mans. Tanks don’t want you competing for gear. You’re better off tanking the dungeon yourself if you want fast groups
---
1. Stay arms for tanking dungeons. Charge -&gt; SS -&gt; WW is unparalleled AoE threat. Use a 2H for at least the opener, and learn when you need to switch to a shield based on incoming damage. 
---
2. Farm your pre-BiS. I’d recommend starting arena+angerforge runs ASAP; you should be doing 5x per hour whenever you are afk or doing other stuff. It takes about 20 minutes for all 5 runs in a 2 man party. 
---
3. Take mining and herbalism and duo dm jump runs if you need gold. 
---
4. Make a macro to unequip all of your gear and play like a bitch on the way into dungeons unless you outnumber the enemy. Depending on your server and situation, maybe just play like a bitch anyways. You’ll save a lot of money on repairs this way. Even if you can’t your armor off before you enter combat and/or don’t want to be a sandbagger so you try to win, take off your weapon if you know you are going down. Every little bit helps. 
---
5. Enjoy the best PvE class in the game. Number one DPS for the entirety of the game (we don’t count the single ignite mage who gets to post damage numbers from all the other mages as his own). Rogues on suicide watch—they were in second place even in the first Warcraftlogs review wowhead posted, and they scale linearly. 
---
Have fun!

" **Sitting** improves **health regeneration** by 10 **health** per tick. It does not affect mana. "
---
It's a video game. It's not asking someone to take them into their bunker as the world ends. You don't need to be this mean to anyone.
---
Spell (or shadow) damage doesn't boost the damage of your wand.
---
Your curses can though.
---
The only way I made it through leveling the first time was pure hype to hit level 60 and little bursts of nostalgia.  
---
I play the game way more than I realistically should and enjoy the majority of my time in game, but if I were forced to reroll, or spend all of my time in game corpse running, I'd quit. Leveling in classic again would be absolutely painful without nostalgic glasses on imo.
---
Blizz didn't think it would be popular, agreed but that doesn't account for server imbalance
---
Server imbalance has ALWAYS cause issues. Still does today in some form or another with BfA.
---
How would blizzard "fix" server faction stability without forcing people to leave their server? That's always been an issue.
---
The big problem people have with the "game", isn't even the game itself! It's how other people play the game.
---
It takes me ~14.5 minutes from zone in to zone out to solo angerforge so I definitely can’t get 5 runs in an hour but it’s nice to not have to rely on others. It’s possible if I was selling runs the person coming with me could help and I might be able to do it in 12 to get 5 per hour though.
---
When we get new members they get gear right away mostly, as people already have the stuff that drops and they can just pick it up cheap.
---
Better than a new player coming in, winning a mageblade or perditions and suddenly being “too busy” to ever raid again.
---
Good loot council guild would let you roll if you've been on time and contribute to raid.
---
And not one good name in the group
---
Mages, have you had trouble getting groups, gear, and AoE leveling spots? I notice that nearly every server, mages are either tied for #1 or #1 most populated class. Have you found that to be a major struggle end-game or is it working out fine, especially when it comes to gearing?
---
I have a 60 Warlock and in the last week have moved my alt Priest from below level 20 to level 37 almost.
---
Been good so far but STVietnam is a bit of a mess
---
Did you also factor in that your ISB buff when you crit can ITSELF resist, so hit also increases your ISB uptime which I'm sure you can do the calculations for and have before making such a definitive statement.
---
Dark pact takes ~15 GCD’s to top off from 0 mana. How long do you have to run to regen that much mana with 200 spirit? Still slower than taking a drink.
---
Be me. Wake up at 11am server already popping. Log into main nothing special going on, most people from my guild still sleeping or doing other stuff. 
---
Be on 30-70 ratio ally favoured server. Shit... playing horde... I can’t play the victim card if I get ganked. Decides to log into my lvl 53 alt. Get some levelling done till friends come online. Spawn at inn in Tanaris. Get farmed by ally as soon as I spawn. Run back as a ghost. Wait until it seems kind of clear, spawn run it to the fp die halfway. Do it again, this time I managed to fly away. 
---
Heading to Un’Goro, land on 20 corpses gnome rogue stands behind me mage front of me Druid blocks the exit. They didn’t attack me yet so pretend to be afk. After 10-20 seconds I start mounting. They haven’t noticed it. As soon as I’m up on my horse start gunning it towards the exit. Gets killed half way through. 
---
See a bunch of ghosts at gy. Decides to start spamming general chat for raid group. Sadly there are no horde ganking groups in the zone. Decides to make my own. Start inviting all the dead people and keep spamming general to msg me inv if wanna fight for fp. Not many people join. Spam invite on people I find in /who. Gets 15 people together in about 20 minutes. 
---
Group at river, start heading to camp. Alive people push in dead resets healer heal them up we all push in 15 50-55 against 6 60s we wipe them and continue to corpse camp them for 30 minutes. 
---
Lesson of the story, you can get things done by organising a group together and fight them off. You don’t have to go and cry on reddit straight away. 
---
They came back camping in a couple of hours but by the time I was done with my quest and out of the zone.
---
Put your first 5 points in wand spec. At lvl 13 buy a greater magic wand off the AH.
---
Literally happening on Incendius right now. Just got killed in IF by Yang Gang.
---
&gt;Hell, I thought the first MC clear of classic being accomplished with people below 60 would cause the opposite effect, but I guess not.
---
A majority of the raid was level 60. This guild is made up of top players, they've been playing on multiple fresh Vanilla servers for years now. They easily have hundreds of Molten Core clears and know the entire raid inside and out. It's not like they were in bad pre-raid gear either because they were farming dungeons while leveling up.
---
Wish people would drop this horrible mindset because it's not accurate. Enjoy wiping to Rag all night because your raid doesn't have every level 60 with some sorta gear.
---
The margin of error of sporadic and incomplete submissions is 100%. Get with the times, bub. The only site with a chance at reflecting accurate proportions is ironforge.pro because it doesn’t rely on manual submission directly to the site.
---
Horde Herod here. I wouldn't mind if Blizzard beefed up FP/base defenses ie SWTOR. In that game, you basically need a full raid to take on any fp/base/camp. Keeps survivability fair imo.
---
Raids survived during the previous massive queue timers. Also whole guild will migrate not just half of one.
---
Ask any mage that has AoE farmed mobs with quest items. You loot one from a mob and if another mob dropped it as well you get the "You can't carry any more of that." notification.
---
im ally and do this in og and there are many others. maybe put down your tunnelvision goggles for once
---
Thats pretty normal now. We have a few Rogues that live in IF since a few Weeks.
---
Don’t bother with this guy, he has some issues he needs to deal with I think. He’s actually PMing me on 2 different accounts right now... I just hope he gets help.
---
It's wasted on a Feral. Very easy to cap hit by other means if you DPS, and armor rings are much more valuable if you tank.
---
Give him prio on Heavy Dark Iron Ring instead.
---
Does this work in combat?

Lol whitemane is a shitshow for both sides. Try getting to DM as horde without running into 5 corner camp squads
---
And both are almost identical, bub.
---
&gt; Roughly every 5 to 15 minutes, although every once in a while I have to take a break to get a snack.
---
You are doing this all manually???
---
There was a horde guild inside of iron forge just the other day.
---
Frost is the only viable spec for raids until AQ. Pve most people go frost just because they focus on frost damage for raids. For pvp fire/frost is a very powerful spec, but it requires different gear that a lot of people don't have yet
---
Ok but your statement "Talk to people on your server and fight back instead of whining on the forums..." Is ridiculous.
---
So I don't know what you mean with good stuff. It should be normal that when you are a new member you will most likely only get stuff most others don't need as much. 
---
When you look at DKP guilds it really depends on how they make their DKP. Our guild for example softcaps at 500 DKP (which is about 3-4 weeks of DKP) and everything over 500 DKP is affected by a 10% decay. The average item on our raids goes for 100-300 DKP with exceptions of 400+ for really good shit like weapons. 
---
In loot council guilds it is an absolute luck thing on whether you are in a good one or a bad one. It also really depends on what you are in terms of role etc. I had for example a loot council guild offer me that I will have almost my complete T1 within 3 weeks should I join them. This is because they really needed another Shaman Healer. 
---
Personally I believe your only choice is to join a guild that uses one of these systems. Sure there are guilds that work on rolling, but they won't survive for long. If you intend to clear AQ40 or even Naxx, you will need an LC or DKP guild.
---
&gt;but it's generally seen as against the rules.
---
by whom? either it is, or isn't against the rules.
---
&gt;sometimes people make alts on the other faction
---
Not on the same server they don't unless they have 2 accounts.
---
I thought shadow priest is something you get as rng when creating your character. I kept creating deleting priests because i got the smite that does holy and not shadow damage.
---
For context it was my 1st mmo and i was 13 years old
---
I agree with your message, but I must laugh at placing fusion in the same universe as grizzly when it comes to playtime, world presence, and skill.
---
Aren't Draenei inspired by Tieflings?
---
non pvp server?
---
I still think fps will be camped pretty hard. Maybe the lesser ones will be less populous but places like thorium point I don't see not being camped at raid times ever.
---
Also consider free-action potions, it’ll relieve some of the frost nova and slowing
---
People are acting like this kind of thing didn't happen constantly back in the day for tons of things; I remember pretty clearly that cross-faction guilds would agree to let the other do world bosses at certain times on PVP servers. 
---
Beyond that, it's really not bannable. You can work with the other faction. Is it scummy? A little. Did people do this in the past and still nolife rank 14? Yeah. You'll have plenty of chances to spend 14 hours a day playing PVP battlegrounds for honor. There can only be one, after all.
---
Me and buddy made mage/lock combo and it’s way more fun then gettin corpse camped on my leve 53 warrior
---
Yes, but rings are one of the few slots where you can get bonus armor, which is insanely strong on Druids. Devilsaur, hit bracers, and the Onyxia neck will get you to 4% hit without sacrificing your ring slots. That's more than enough hit for a tank.
---
If you're giving Accuria to a Feral DPS... god help your Warriors and Rogues.
---
&gt; post a line number

Saying "it's in the code" doesnt make it true. If it is in fact true, so post some line numbers so others can confirm.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4tsi8/i_cant_believe_people_still_fall_for_this_lol_im/). 
---
Dude what?!
---
Yeah dude in /2 on Horde we're always planning on how to spout our propaganda on the ClassicWoW Reddit hahaha 
---
There's been plenty of times BRM has been Alliance controlled when trying to get into an instance and EPL/WPL/Winterspring definitely have Alliance roaming gank squads. There's a skew towards Horde but it's really not as bad as an 80:20 ratio you make it out to be. 
---
The dismissal of my opinion just because I rolled Horde is coming up pretty quick on propaganda btw. 
---
Go roll on Remulos if getting ganked upsets you so much on a PvP server.
---
[:thinking:](https://i.imgur.com/pfm2P5y.jpg)
---
Read the user agreement and tos.
---
What the fuck
---
good suggestion, i will wait untill then i think, thanks!
---
Well then just run with a DKP. If you are in it for the long haul anyway, what matter is a 2-3 week delay in a few epics? Half of our members barely write anything or take part in any form of the guild aside from raids. It still works out fine for everyone.
---
How exactly do you "ban spy"?
---
they could, but why would they if it's not against the rules. Besides how would they ever monitor all the realms and all the zones for collusion? Much easier to just let it slide.
---
No logs, no answer.
---
When we go to raids or pvp and some of us don't have 100% mounts yet, I can use the 60% to stay with the group/escort safely as well as seeming like less of a threat.
---
This is hilarious.
---
Wow yikes dude do you need me to spell out sarcasm for you or do you think everyone on the internet sounds like the voices in your head
---
I know people have different priorities in life, but I cant figure out how everyone is complete already and can think about alts or rerolling because they are bored. I took me a month to hit 60 and I started day 1. I've had quel'Serra and BOE for about a month at this point and just found the time to farm righteous orbs for crusader enchant. I get a healthy dose of raiding, tons of solo and small team world pvp, dungeons, farming etc etc but am no where near the point of being able to think about another character because there is so much to do still... but that's just me
---
Nope that was a joke, it is automated.
---
Guessing I'm the only one that read this as banana
---
Didnt even sound like the priest  in the story had water.
---
53 or 54 is when you should start in BRD.
---
I played Vanilla also and the elitism you’re seeing is based on everyone having a ready made BIS list in front of them that most didn’t have in Vanilla.  My guess is half the time you aren’t getting in Arena / Anger runs is because other people want HoJ and aren’t willing to roll against someone for it.
---
Also - everyone wants these super specialized runs trying to get their gear -  I don’t remember that as much in Vanilla.  Between Arena/Anger, Jed/Rend, Tribute, Jump Runs, Lava Jumps, etc... it gets annoying as hell.  I wish people would just go run an instance from start to finish.
---
Can’t go back though - it’s too late.  Too much information out there and no one wants to do anything that doesn’t drive towards their BIS gear in most cases.
---
Yeah, this has been happening since 2004 on every server. Major cities are actually the best place to farm afk people and its not hard for rogues/druids to get in.
---
I have a 60 hunter. I have been leveling a warrior and he is now level 48. I also have a level 20 priest. My goal is to get all 3 characters to 60. I might also get my alliance mage to level 60 as well but he is only level 6 right now lol.
---
Silent bidding has too much possibility for abuse imo. We just have open bidding going on and the biggest complaint was 2 players making a deal on not bidding high. But that was about it and it simply lead to every class forming their little groups with intern speakabouts.
---
Getting raid loot can take more time than any other class, but I enjoy the mind numbing 1 button job. Maybe throw in a poly every once a day. However, it can be the fastest leveling class. They all have their ups and downs.
---
as you said....on the people who support him and this behavior. there is a streamer I watch (avoidingthepuddle) that bans/has his mod ban anyone in bis chat, could be a 4 year sub or a non stub doesn't matter, everyone is the same. its the wild wild west. people know this, its part of his "schtick" and people get randomly banned all the time.
---
to be fair, if they did get randomly banned or he knows they were banned over something dumb/nothing he usually tells his mods to "unban that guy!" or he will himself after, its part of the show. but my point is people sub and more importantly chat willingly, knowing this.
---
So only 60:40 - only outnumbered 3:2. Much better!
---
Correct, aside from shield bash and shield slam, which do not benefit from weapon skill as they are off-hand attacks.
---
I also have a 53 rogue on another server as horde and have done things similar, but when you’re in your 30’s it’s not possible. This isn’t “crying on Reddit as soon as it happens”. It’s been weeks. I have almost 3 1/2 days played time and I just got 40. On a fucking hunter. My gnome only took 5 days played to 60.
---
So yeah, say I get 15 lvl 35-37s together. You think we can kill the 10 60’s that are roaming desolace. We **might** kill three, given we have comms and competent players.
---
Also, huge flaw in what you’re talking about. *You’re worth honor*. I am not. At least there’s a reason for camping you. Also Un’goro. Matter of fact now that I think about it your example has no bearing on mine. As a 60 why would I not go to Un’goro and take it over? I get to farm Devilsaur **and** honor? That makes perfect sense.
---
What doesn’t make sense is corpse camping a lvl 30 **inside Booty Bay**.
---
Cool, enjoy that vendor water bud
---
dps being butthurt about healers and tanks rolling on dps items are funny as hell
---
If you want to go PVP roll Grobbulus.  We are pretty close to 50/50 and unless you are going to no life it you’ll have no issues at least leveling to 30 or 35...  by that time the BGs will be out and hopefully the gankfest has died down a little bit.
---
Use a dictionary instead of asking stupid questions. What do you think "had more to do with it" means?
---
So I can give some insight into our raid system.
---
Trial is 3 weeks on our guild in which you have to come to every raid until you are promoted to raider. But Raider and Trial is essentially simply, casual and hardcore. The raiders are the core team and they are taken into raids over trials if we are full. DKP earning is the same for everyone so even as a trial you can buy items.
---
At the same point we also demote everyone who misses for 2 weeks without notice of going on a vacation or similar back to trial.
---
People do realize 'detect players in stealth' addons existed in real vanilla, right?  Just because you were a noob back then and didn't know about these things didn't mean they didn't exist in some form.
---
&gt; look at it yourself
---
Sure, if you post line numbers. Burden of proof is on you.
---
Ideally you want 2 axes. Getting 9% hit will soft cap you for the sword, but it doesn't reduce glancing penalty like weapon skill does. If you decide to keep a sword offhand you should get some weapon skill from edgemasters or something rather than run 9% hit.
---
It makes a sound similar to the sound of a shadow bolt
---
I WILL 1V1 YOU RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, I WILL 1V1 YOU ANYWHERE!
---
Why do people say this, or think this matters? You're a rogue dude.
---
This is the main reason, skipping pulls is way easier with 5 60s.
---
And there is me playing on an 11"Mac book air from 2015 :(
---
It's really not that bad for killing mobs and allowed me to easily heal dungeons without respeccing.
---
It's a mix of a lot of things, blizzard allowing big pop imbalance through transfers, blizzard allowing higher server population, people being more minmax-y after 15 years. I suspected something like this would happen so I weighed the options and decided to roll on pve, we get the same battlegrounds as you do, just without hours of corpserunning in open world. Just that i don't blame the "gankers", they're just doing whatever's most results per effort to farm honor.
---
Your first mistake was going main entrance for live side. 
---
Start taking side entrance, its much faster
---
Good to hear.  I started leveling a Rogue earlier tonight to see how it goes.
---
I’ve spent two months to get three days played time on one account. If I rerolled I likely wouldn’t get 60 until April unless I get fired or my place burns down.
---
The problem is there aren't any Alliance out in the world, IF as a Rogue is great honour. I never see single player, or even small groups of Alliance, it's either empty or a 20 man raid (empty more often than not). It's Blizzard's fuck up 100%, they made the game unplayable for Alliance and now it's a ghost town, so we have to resort to shit like this to get our honour.
---
Welcome to "real" life, people don't owe you shit. Ime a lower level character is going to add at least 30 minutes to the run (for brd anger/arena runs you want a fast clear so you can have more chances at loot because SGC doesn't exist) because they *have* to do all of the possible quests in the instance and they require more trash to be pulled, that's not even counting loss of dps.
---
It's unreasonable to expect a pug to carry you to 60, if you want that join a guild that will help you
---
You could just bring another mage and negate any damage the buff gives by just him doing more damage than you by a lot.
---
Pretty decent for aoe slow...
---
Even with EPGP, people will still have issues. There were people in my guild who knowingly joined us as a EPGP guild, and after a few weeks they wanted us to go to a LC system to make it fair. 
---
We're currently DE'ing useful pvp loot because players don't want it since they are banking for their BiS, which is annoying since I got aurastone last week after dumping all of my points into meme/OS gear and I still perform within top 5 of all the healers (usually 2nd or 3rd, and 1st on fights where I prep properly and get competitive about it).
---
All loot systems have their issues, but I could never do LC for classic.
---
I totally agree, I think the tipping point for me was I did not enjoy mage as much as I thought I would
---
This may come as a surprise to you, but not everyone wants to be the pve bis hunter race. Pvpers go orc, and the hit scope is booboo for pvp as well.
---
Got a 60 Horde Druid, rolled an Alliance Priest on a new server and I’m having a blast. Don’t know if I’ll make it to 60 but I’m enjoying it a lot more then the “pvp” i was doing on my Druid.
---
Theres also tons of Ally to counter that too. But they want to have mount parades in IF instead 🤷‍♂️
---
The #1 complaint was that the rewards for R4-10 were trash. You could get much better gear from dungeons for less effort, and most people who were into competitive pvp already had better gear.
---
A small group of people were grinding for R12-14 gear, but most people just pvped for fun with no expectation of a reward.
---
Its world of WARcraft, pvp doesnt mean you queue in a fair setup where everything is super balanced and no team has an advantage over the other.
---
World PvP is that you run into an ambush, getting killed by being outnumbered and calling reinforcements yourself.
---
Instead of World PvP I would call it Guild PvP, and if you refuse to play with other people and build an community world pvp is as good for you as Solo Queue in LoL or Solo Ranked in CSGO, ofc you wont get anything if you play WoW as a singleplayer game.
---
But than pvp servers are not for you and you should play on a pve server. We have a guild with 300+ active people, we have an active discord communicating if somewhere people need help so we can logon and get there, we have 90% who leveled ingi to get the pvp items, we roam around with multiple 40 man groups and we did this for years on private servers together, still we are daily growing with new players we dont know yet from pservers.
---
Btw we did this back in the days as well, we always killed everyone in front of sunwell doing their dailys, we took Halaa for weeks straight for the alliance and we kept killing hordescum infront of karazhan too.
---
Boohoo PvP is happening and its not a fair arena like environment who would have known that :D
---
Protip: try not to die.
---
I have 29 days /played on my mage ,I'll never reroll I can't be bothered to get all that progress back, go through the shitty leveling process, getting pre bis and raid gear again farming 5k gold and buying every consume I need for classic
---
These people are full of shit Vanilla WoW was like this. Don't let the LEGION of redidiot voters down voting you lie to you. Pvp was big and camping shit like this before BGs was common.
---
It was the essence of PVP servers. Half these shit turds weren't alive probably when the game was made. Either way this sub is trash and dumb to smoke I'm out from it cause all they do is downvote anyone that disagrees with them. Good luck in here its not worth your time.
---
I agree that’s why this time around in viewing it as something for fun vs. a rush to 60. I rushed my first 1-60 and farming pre bis
---
You're full of shit. It was like this.
---
APES downed Rag within a WEEK of launch. A fucking week. 
---
We know how to play the game. We know what the phases were and what that meant for maximizing honor.
---
Nailed it.
---
I tanked all content with 0% hit. Passed on the Ony neck for the first couple of months, but now I have one so I sit at 1% hit.
---
Threat is not a problem for Druids.
---
Just curious; why did you roll on a PVP realm, and NOT expect this to happen? 
---
I'm being dead serious, I'd like to know. I'm on a PVP realm and had some IRL stuff come up that stopped me from playing for a while, so I hit level 30 during phase 1 and just today hit 43 today after playing for several days after work over the past week or so. Because of this, STV was DEFINITELY more like Vietnam than I'd of been hoping, but I knew that this would happen. For reference, I'm Horde on Bigglesworth. 
---
If you didn't want to be camped and farmed for honor, it may be best to look into Engineering for a PvP realm and, in general, heading to these kinds of instances with larger groups, even if you're solo farming. You'll either get in, or get into a 5 v 5 fight in most scenarios where you can potentially get honor AND get to the dungeon.
---
I instinctively start casting conjure water any time I get a PM from someone I don't know.
---
Old Blanchy is probably the best US west server for someone in your situation. Send me a message on Seanzietron. I can help you out. :)
---
&gt; the Alliance guilds
---
Wow a multi-player game where people group up on a massive scale? We could call it, Massively-multiplayer!
---
Edit: Whitemane has been Ally dominated for awhile. And people want to talk about "Horde propaganda" 
---
 https://imgur.com/5KntaUv.jpg
---
Sounds like nothing can be any worse than d/e ing useful loot...
---
Some people value their time in a game where you literally pay by the month
---
Because losing that item to a roll is somehow better? Or having to constantly blow smoke up the loot council's ass so they might deign to grace you with loot?
---
I agree you worth no honour, but the enemy camping you does. /who change the brackets up to 60. Spam them with messages until they help you. 
---
So they will corpse camp the person who corpse camped you. In stv you will always find 10-20 60s in which ever faction.
---
yep, you're right.
---
How do you manage to die as a horde?

&gt; Hi friend!

&gt; This page is a hub to upload your census data, gathered by the WoW addons CensusClassicPlus or ClassicCensusPlus. As you may know, the census addons do not work correctly since september 19th. That also means, the amount of active characters will shrink day by day in the shown data!
---
Nah, the guy just whispered me asking if I wanted to join. I dunno what applying entails, but all I said to get in was pretty much "Sure let's give it a shot"
---
The thread was never pinned that I recall. I’d love to see an archived entry where it is. There may be a limit to the number of stickied threads, as well. Regardless, no, they’ll likely continue to move at the same snail’s pace regardless of whether or not the thread is pinned.
---
fury tanking is trash when you are still in garbage gear
---
You want to be in deep prot when you are just starting gear collection at 60 or close to 60
---
Only been with them for a week but that raid had no problem filling up
---
all loot is bis for hunter
---
You're getting downvoted because you're thinking of the player as a statistic and not as a person. It makes sense for high end progression guilds to work together to create the ultimate team, but those guilds are few and far between and Classic is orders of magnitude less difficult than retail WoW, there is no need to effectively take a shit on the players using the "meme" specs just because your 1 button rotation does more DPS than theirs.
---
I agree with give them fair loot or don't take them, if you cared enough about min-maxing for logs you wouldn't invite a "meme" spec and for progression it doesn't matter who gets the loot, dps can outgear everything without any raid items.
---
It's a bad thing that consumer knowledge grew and was iterated on over 15 years? It's unrealistic to expect a game to play *exactly* how it did back then. That would go for any title re-released after years. OSRS, Halo, CoD, - games like this, even when hashed as a remaster, never play exactly like the original. And they shouldn't, considering knowledge of things doesn't just stop or cease to evolve.
---
I have yet to see a single suggestion other than "release BGs" from people, as to how Blizzard could address this. No one has called for Blizz to implement the same server caps as back then. They probably would not intentionally limit technology that has improved drastically. Alter NPC numbers or strength? Then you'll have just as many folks enraged about keeping the game exactly how it was.
---
So please, suggest meaningful ideas instead of continuing the outrage that's currently occurring in every thread on here. Yes, there are more people playing and the game is harder. There are inherent downfalls to rolling on a PvP server; I don't see quitting like some are as a logical solution to the game presenting new challenges that have resulted from 15 years of change. But hey, to each their own. And my main point was surrounding the most hardcore of players anyways. The most dedicated PvP players from Vanilla were just as committed to honor grinding as Classic ones are today.
---
What about spriest
---
It's such a shame too. I had an amazing time leveling two different chars through areas like STV and Tarren Mill during phase one. I'd be very anxious of going back now that honour is about.
---
I always knew flurry was amazing from my days as a fury warrior, Ive just always been surprised that the talent is THAt powerful. I guess it's really just a perfect storm of their scaling syncrionizing perfectly with gear and world buffs. More hits and crits means more rage which means more damage and more flurry procs which leads to more rage and damage, plenty of rage dumps, and bloodthirst being one of the best scaling abilities in the game. I know at 2k attack power it's even better damage/rage then execute
---
A is not before 1, dude. 0123456789ABCDEF
---
Goblin towns are neutral territory, not really a fair comparison.
---
Yea time to reroll on a pve realm i guess
---
Yeah but even if I want to mark them all, and if you're all in greens and fresh to 60 that's a bloody good idea in certain instances, it's seconds per pack. General rule IMO is if you healer is drinking between packs, mark every damn mob.. cause you're one thing going sideways from a corpse run and *that* will take up more time than any marking system you feel like.
---
And honestly... far as I'm concerned it's up to the tank. If they're more comfortable marking everything they can do that. Instances run at the tanks pace, at least if you want me to tank anyway.
---
Yikes
---
There’s no fixing it.  You making the 1000th post asking the same things this week isn’t fixing it.  In 15 years Blizzard hasn’t fully fixed it.  They’ve gotten better, but as long as people are willing to buy gold for real money, you’ll have bots.
---
I like the farming ones they keep mats reasonable.
---
Just killed you but then you 5v2d us ;)
---
If you play for 4 hours a day every day for a month in a row you are not casual in any way

How to accidentally lose 15% of the bid. But yeah, can be worth.

And then blizzard increased the devilsaur spawn rates drastically and the mafias disappeared overnight. 
---
I’ll shit on blizzard whenever but this isn’t a good example
---
Fair enough, a pirate town should probably have a stronger guard presence than the only cross continent port for a major alliance.

Ony neck has hit on it and is vastly superior for both PVE and PVP for Rogues/Hunters/Warriors.

I can't tell if you're a warrior or a pally but some classes just have more gearing options currently. My druid friend is fully geared in BiS excluding world boss drops/pvp. They don't have many upgrades left except for a helm/necklace from azurgos I believe. Meanwhile my warrior friend needs 800g gauntlets, 1.2k helm, some expensive pants, savage gladiator chain which needs a couple hundred runs, possibly a 500g book if not some raid weapons that 14 other people also want, also thunderfury or maybe even a sulfuron ingot and a ton of arcanite bars. They have a lot to work on if they choose to at all times while my druid friend is one of three in the guild and all the druids are fully geared.
---
I was so confused by this until I turned on this sub's CSS back on and realized my flair. I am, regrettably, Alliance.
---
Well said.
---
Look up balance/Resto hybrids. They are exceptionally better than rets lol.
---
honestly with the people that come in here to complain about being killed only want opions that validate their own and refuse to accept that maybe they are just to lazy to get a group together. and no matter what you say you will "Never understand" because your not alliance.
---
Imagine watching that video and calling it PvP.
---
so if they changed their flare would his opinion matter more?
---
AAø
---
Cooperation between guilds is not inherently wrong - its a fundamental part of the game that the 2 factions can cooperate to a certain extent, be that with the AQ opening, or the shared AH - this type of cooperation is not frowned upon because it does not compromise the integrity of each respective faction.
---
When PvP becomes involved, it quickly raises the stakes, we saw this with "Devilsaur mafias" and now we are seeing it with the "Blackrock Mountain Goons" who goes there to farm honor, but purposely avoid attacking/killing certain players of the opposing faction who are actually there for the same reason, sometimes even assisting them by applying bandage debuffs on their fellow faction players, or using polymorph to help the opposing faction players to recover their health.
---
Logic dictates these squads should duke it out, but because of some shady deals, they do not, nor do they assist any fellow faction members who are attacked by these players which they "avoid".
---
Doesn’t happen on Kurrinnaxx but we have at least 40% ally to 60% horde. Sucks going to brd/DM/Winterspring/EPL/WPL cause of horde though. Even if we form a raid group they just overwhelm us with there vast numbers
---
Sorry, But where is the evidence that it's been fixed? This is from the site's own mouth. If you can provide evidence contrary then I'm happy to see it. 
---
Why would their own website say such a thing? People can keep uploading, It doesn't make it accurate. Besides the point anyway, You would require all or a majority of the population for anyone to take that information seriously.
---
Very few people are falling for anything.... they are just playing along as you took the time to make a useless macro for playing around, so too are they playing around.
---
Full MC raid gear isn't bis?  
---
What is better?
---
Get knowledge of the other classes and duel! You will feel completely lost at first but you will get it down. I dont know how it looks at your realm but om mine duelling in durotar is quite dead although this will grow when battlegrounds are implented.
---
Start an Alliance character and post your video on how to do it please! You sounds awesome!
---
You’re so wrong
---
I work on average 50ish hrs a week. I've had weeks where I worked 80 hrs and weeks I've worked 40. I started 1 or 2 weeks after classic launched n I just hit 60 yesterday with all my secondary professions maxed and mining maxed. BS is almost there. Need like 30 more points lol. If I wasn't spending time with my son or working I was playing wow. I would say your doing pretty damn good at lvl 58 with wife n kid n stuff. If I was still married I wouldnt even be lvl 40 lol
---
Threat Plates
---
Roll Ally and show us how to do it. You are so awesome!
---
Those are the retailers who dont understand that not everyone provides honor, they have no clue so they kill you over and over and since retailers have no skill they are not able to compete with high level players which is why they try to kill lowbies instead.
---
Retail made people weak, only the private server masterrace can survive this.
---
Hmm that wierd.
---
As far as I know classicduration lib should be build into elvui.
---
I like this a lot :&gt;
---
In fact, looking at this dudes About page on his website.
---
(https://wowclassicpopulation.com/about) He hasn't even updated it for ages. 
---
How can anyone hardly trust a source that seems so dated?
---
Pretty sure. It’s like running brd and entering MC through the entrance near the emp. The long way but no one needs attunment. The lesser instance will limit you to 10 though.
---
Can I have your stuff
---
You know, these are actual people you are talking about... ffs
---
My time was saying it's reasonable to give slots to off spec and it wont ruin your raid.
---
And the SP doesnt get innervates he just relies on consumes I suppose.
---
Delete character, make it on another account with the same name, restore character and whoopsie character name already take please change.
---
Its frequently on reddit dont know how you missed it but here again.
---
Our feral dps really wants it. What are these other options to get 9% hit?
---
I'm pretty sure under-58 can't even enter MC...
---
&gt; why is it possible for a 60 to gank a 39
---
Because they make your health go to zero before theirs go to zero.
---
Holy fuck.  That's almost 8 hours a day average since launch. Even at my most hardcore I don't think I averaged that much for that long.
---
No I’m saying if you want to be part of a group you should do so expecting to pull your weight and benefit from the drops equally, without being paid or reserving items. If you want to be one of those guys selling your role to a group you better be doing it without expectations of ANY drops in the dungeon since your now selling a service and NOT an equal part of the group.
---
 I don’t see a problem with selling tanking or healing services if you are not also rolling on righteous orbs or boss drops. Expecting both because we have less of your role is bullshit and not the same.
---
its okay man enjoy playing with the worst bunch on the server.  They knocking it down and will only take 40 at aq, goodluck raiding with anyone else then once yang gang kicks out anyone that isn't part of their inner circle.
---
I never got a piece from them after raiding 4 weeks in a row and ony attuned half that guild, before i realized the shits they were.  Yeah man layer resetting mc loot and the end of dungeons to farm 10k+ gold sure was legit.. you right
---
Are you reason what he says... he makes a new character with that name. Then restores the old one. It’s his account still.
---
&gt; 3 times
---
Most "bad" servers were about 60/40 at worse, which isn't 2 times as many Horde. 
---
&gt; more raids flying in
---
Learn to guerilla warfare is all I can say. This isn't the 1700s where armies line up and exchange vollies.
---
I mean was he resto or was he healing? 
---
I generally prefer to tank on my druid but I have a healing set and can heal just fine, that doesn't mean I'm going to pass on the tank stuff that drops though. I'm just healing cause that's what's needed.
---
drain tank for lvling
---
Ay yo whata that scrolling text addon?
---
A guild run mate, that what you need. Get a guild to play with. Don't expect complete randoms to take care of your under leveled ass heh.
---
Back then nobody knew what they were doing, we are smarter now and we know a 51 warrior is gonna have a real bad time, doing end bosses in brd. You can't hit shit.
---
Honestly I'm finding it more sad how people are talking about him. He *clearly* has issues and for some reason everyone wants to.. what? Make him angry and more upset? Why?
---
Just feel sorry for him and move on. I genuinely hope he gets some help.
---
It really sounds like I've made you mad. I like that!
---
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop letting that anger blind you from using your eyes, as I don't see a point in responding if you're just going to keep ignoring my replies and attacking the same strawman you've built up.
---
&gt; every server but heartseeker
---
Most servers were 60/40 at worse. Whitemane and Earthfury are still Ally dominated as well. Keep up the propaganda though Alliance dogs.
---
Hey man, il 1v1 you any day as the most op duelling class! Pussies!
---
That doesn’t work anymore, that was fixed earlier this year.
---
Are you a troll? You are in every thread trying to rile people up with that shitty rethoric.
---
Yeah, and these guys are talking about TBC being launched on separate servers being an absolute certainty, which they did not say.  Perhaps you should read a little slower before you lose your shit you fucking moron.
---
* Devilsaur (2% set bonus) 
---
* Blackmist Armguards 
---
* Onyxia Tooth Pendant
---
* Truestrike Shoulders (2%) 
---
* Mask of the Unforgiven (2%)
---
That's 8% without any rings. If he uses Wolfshead instsead of the Mask, he can use 2x Elven Ring to make up the other 2%.
---
Accuria is a direct upgrade to Elven Ring. That's not debatable. But given that hit is a fairly weak stat for Feral DPS and it's easy to cap, you are better off giving your Feral a Quick Strike Ring + Elven Ring instead. Then he can use Quick Strike + Circle of Applied Force when BWL comes out.
---
Accuria is very good for a very long time for Rogues and Warriors, but the Feral will replace it in BWL.
---
Why would an about page need to be updated frequently? He also doesn't need to do anything manually, the submission page can easily insert the .lua data into a database, which is then queried by the front end webpage, which generates the graphs.

18 NAKED COWBOYS IN THE SHOWERS AT RAM RANNNCH
---
Is that a angry mob chasing you with 2 hands of rag?
---
9 out of 10 times we're already fighting the next mobs when he healer sits down to drink though.
---
That makes me feel even better about it, it has some rng but so far I've made about 6000 gold off the one farm. Its a similar feeling to being called a cheater in a shooter when you're not cheating.
---
Well attunement quest is 55, so there that.

Dudus master race

I am a casual horde player on your server. Can confirm, all the alliance left are madmen.

You playin this on a Nintendo DS?
---
It’s really an army of blizzard employees doing their part to push people back to retail
---
Do you want to spend longer in the instance than necessary? That lifetap straight translates into faster clearing. What do you think they lifetap for?
---
It was just someone I saw in Org, I know people who have opened tickets for similar things and the GMs won't do anything
---
Ganking was part of vanilla
---
You only ever get stuck in the tunnel when a demon is walking through, just charge hamstring and keep moving
---
&gt;I bet you by yourself already made three warriors on your server raise their prices by 100% just as reasonable compensation for suffering you in party chat for an hour.
---
I can only hope! Maybe I can make them quit too if I try hard enough(Can I make you quit too if I keep talking?)
---
You certainly make some creative assumptions about people.
---
Captain hindsight everybody
---
Nah, being toxic is the cool thing to do nowadays so regardless of population balance it was inevitable that pvp servers were going to be dumpster fires filled with neck beards
---
that's happening anyway, people are quitting. If Blizzard want to keep making money they'll have to stop the bleeding somehow.
---
Everyday it's the same bitching
---
Imagine picking one of the most populated places in the game to blatantly break ToS
---
Yeah lol it's Mankrik
---
But at the same time I'm saying play how ever you like, not "don't expect to get Loot" like op, which is just not true.
---
I said it's about having fun, it's a game right? Do you not play wow to have fun?
---
This is why I'm a full destruction build on my warlock this time. currently 7 0 31 at level 47 - just enough to get improved lifetap, then all went into Destruction. Why drain life when you can spam 200% crit shadowbolts...
---
Would have helped alot without all the private server basement dwellers that knows the game inside and out
---
Lol i said this like 6-8 months ago and got downvoted to hell for it. #nochange gang majority had very little actual expierence in vanilla.
---
Idk. Idc. What I do know is that what is BIS for hunters is never a good argument for distributing loot like CHT and Brutality blade are bis for hunters but I would refuse to be in a raid where they got roll on them. Specifically for Band of Accuria, tanks being hitcapped is much more important than whatever is on a hunters bis sheet
---
That makes sense.  Same reason we don't allow sunders.
---
Because generally they go quite well without mages?  Especially when you have one to use as a vending machine before the run.
---
Dunno what to tell you: when I don't pull &lt;50% Mana the DPS complains I'm going to slow and I risk them going gung-ho making a pull and wiping us. When I do pull at &lt;50% mana the healer complains and I risk a wipe from OOM.
---
I'm enjoying playing tank but I'm taking this entire experience really slow. Thankfully I'm on an RP server and still relatively low level so everything is pretty chill. I gotta straighten out some DPS every now and again on things I need them to do and not do - but so far I haven't had to pull a "My way or the highway".
---
It will most definitely get better on PvP servers lol
---
&gt; Are most of you guys always in a hurry IRL?
---
We are in a hurry because other than you Mr. Healer and most of the DPS classes our resource is backloaded and if we wait for everyone we will be back down to 0 rage which means the dps who nuke the moment they have line of sight with a mob will just pull aggro.
---
This sucks during leveling so we rather generate some rage at the end of the last pack and jump right into the next pack so we can do something to prevent this.
---
I have 2 healers on level 60 now and I grinded only dungeons with them for leveling so I have pretty good knowledge about how much mana they need for which pull, so I will always engage once you are sitting because by the time I gathered and line of sighted all the mobs so they stack for max cleave dps you should be more than able to keep everybody alive.
---
However I know as well some warriors are just shit and have no gear and no knowledge about healing and they just run in mindlessly.
---
Back in TBC i remember a 3 man group trying to gank my 29 twink hunter when i finally decided to level him. The paladin in their group was at least 40 wearing some plate pieces. I saw them, did a /wave and waited to see if they would leave peacefully. They attacked so i just kited them to death. Waited around and only one respawned so i continued my quest, i guess the paladin wanted revenge since he attacked me when i was pulling mobs, killed him again then decided to wait and kill him a couple more times. His allies were smarter than him by leaving after the first failed 3v1 gank
---
If the tank pulls the next group after heavy healing due to multiple party members being hit I'm left with around 5-10% mana and by the time I need to heal again I'm already less than 50%.. it ends up being a cycle.
---
Ok then I guess you really have bad luck with bad dps / tank groups, I pug tanked alot because I was one of the first 60s commited tank on our server and also used it for gold farming and most of the time it was fine, had some rough groups too but going slow helps alot, nowadays i only run instances with guildies who need stuff
---
I figured most of the ppl playing "WOW Classic" played vanilla. Who else would play a 15 year old game lol. IMO I think nostalgia clouded their judgement.
---
You’re telling me full t1 gear in defensive stance slamming sunder (reminder: the full set bonus is 15% more threat from sunders) isn’t enough aggro? I mean you’re arguing a scenario which hasn’t happened - I wasn’t losing aggro on anything other than the absurd amount of mice that spawn.
---
Oof
---
Nah dude, he's 30 moves ahead of you. On 4 horseman, this guy will NOT have a taunt resisted.
---
Nobody is "crying" on reddit, except the butthurt 7/24 honor farming nolifers. I even posted it with Humor tag, because i find it funny to see 4 people looking at the flight master directly in the eyes while hoping for someone to come in. Reminds me of my dog whenever I enter the house with food in my hand.
---
When the gankers gank the playerbase enough to make them quit or transfer to another server, I really wonder how much fun they will have with their overcrowded faction in a dead server. They will enjoy the 1 hour BG queues I guess :)
---
This is AMAZING! Thank you for all the work you've done so far. Will other classes be added to this in the future? Been thinking of twinking my priest.
---
&gt;0.05% of the players
---
More like 1%. Vanilla peaked at around half a million subs.
---
&gt;The large majority of the playerbase was indeed part of these unknown soldiers.
---
You're right. The large majority of players never became important. And still remain unknown nobodies.
---
WoW has more than 100m registered accounts (maybe 150m), of which barely 2m are now active on Retail based on the latest estimates.
---
So the players who are actually Champions of Azeroth are still 1-2% of the total players. The rest are still low level nobodies.
---
\&gt; (Can I make you quit too if I keep talking?)  
---
Why? Scrubs like you have no impact on my gameplay. All I need to do is close tab and you go away.
---
If you don't have trinket, haven't been playing since day 1 or are afk sure. Theyve never been the top 1v1 class and now that pvp trinkets are available their power levels come down
---
Would you mind linking source? Would like to take a look later.
---
It’s cheating the system, but eh as long as the other classes aren’t complaining everyone is happy
---
That might be correct for heavily layered realms with big queues but we don't have any. Queues are nonexistent or small and each server has 1 layer.
---
Census is wow classic population.
---
Try running with guild mates. Also, it's better if you tank, get a shield and a 1h, adjust your spepc accordingly (so you can quest and tank dungeons) and make groups, stating that you want X or Y items. People will likely be OK with this.
---
What I did was add friends when I found healers/casters who were good, so I had people to invite whenever I wanted to run dungeons. And they were happy to tag along, cause they knew they had a decent tank.
---
Probably that’s the case sadly. I find it completely reasonable to tell them to go play on pve servers then. 
---
Everyone was praising vanilla for making people social, it gives challenges to players that they need to find other players to overcome. 
---
And when it actually happens people don’t like the “challenge” they have to over come.
---
Another person arguing over a point that wasn’t an issue, I wasn’t losing aggro on the pulls, I wasn’t able to control the rats that spawned. That was the single issue that made him leave.
---
it would become an issue when 90% of the players are on PvP servers and making a push with world PvP, with more players than vanilla used to have.
---
You mean a lot of people told you the same?
---
Yea, we spout facts (you want a PVE server). While the Alliance spout lies (the servers are 10v1 when they are 40/60 at worse).
---
Shiiiet my first run as a priest i saw it.
---
1. To make the run faster
---
2. To beat your friends in DPS
---
3. To beat your own DPS  high score
---
4. To show off your wealth
---
Just 4 reasons I came up with off the top of my head
---
You wish you went horde so you would be on an unbalanced side that has more advantages in the game. 
---
Yeah totally not like a coward.
---
Ah thanks.
---
People being held to account for their actions is not shitty, it’s life.
---
So what are you going to bet?
---
Clearly you should have expected it. Plenty of us did. So if you can't handle it, there's pve servers. That's up to you.
---
Thats the price ive gotten on herod alliance for a few weeks now
---
That says more about your dps then it does about your gear.
---
&gt; there are no fixes
---
Then transfers isn't a fix either, why are you suggesting Blizzard do something that isn't a fix?
---
Find a guild to do dungs with, ppl tend to be much nicer then
---
No, that's pvp.
---
And the crybaby whining coming from people is exactly why the game doesn't even have pvp servers anymore.
---
Decided to stream one of my LBRS solo runs. It includes the whole run (to kill Highlord Omokk) from start to finish, with scattered commentary. I was lucky and got the Cloth Leg drop I was looking for.
---
Imagine thinking that there are not 10 ppl camping elementals
---
Twitch app like others have said. 
---
It's also pretty customizable, you can turn different markers on and off.
---
Bro hurry up and log in your emissary is gonna reset soon
---
Blizzard make bad choices? No it can't be, i'm sure they will feel the burn of chasing out the alliance once BG's come around- oh wait, blizzard is doing cross faction BG's too so that alliance get the worst of both worlds yay.
---
Numbers wise yes. Skill wise no.
---
I am no longer a tank, but I keep a "switch to sword and board and taunt" macro handy. It has saved the party a few times.
---
I dont have the macro currently but it’s a start cast stop cast macro. I have it and I actually “TRY” to use it, but I’m not sure if it really works. Would love to know more!
---
I don't exactly see how the presence of a not-gonna-kill-you horde will in any way help the alliance player farm, or vice versa?  Apart from maybe shouting "Hey, there's a rogue here", I don't see how the presence or cooperation of someone (Or lack thereof)  from the other faction can help you...?
---
Anyway, I'm probably going to take the word of someone who is literally the rank 1 feral druid over someone I've never heard of before.
---
&gt; Horde is camping alliance cause they have nothing better to do.
---
This is literally **exactly** what happened in vanilla.
---
I was dead all day everyday because the horde had nothing better to do.
---
And it was so terrible for weeks that we finally just had to give up and leave.
---
And there were thousands of people who abandoned PVP servers. I saw an entire guild from the previous PVP server on the PVE realm I happened to choose. It was a huge deal. It was a big thing. People were demanding free transfers off of PVP servers.
---
This is the authentic vanilla experience.
---
How about you play a mage, then you can give out all the free water you want. Pretty selfish of you to not play a mage tbh.
---
As a tank, why ever take a DPS warrior unless you can't find anyone else? They are going to need a lot of the same gear as you. Let them tank their own groups.
---
Definitely feels like it would be cheating the system. But as it hasn’t started yet I have no idea how the other classes will feel
---
Yeah.. I have all my Pre-BIS and only heal for guild raids now or heal guild dungeon runs. I have a buddy (mage) that I ran Scholo with in order to get some of his +frost gear and the pugs were fucking horrible sometimes.. either guys not knowing what to do or having a "fury tank" pull 2 groups at a time then leaving -.-
---
Winning quickly is far more efficient.  HKs in BGs are just a bonus.
---
Hit % increase will improve your DPS much more than any other stat, even crit.
---
You will also not replace Band of Accuria before a warrior or rogue would, in fact Fury warriors would only prioritize it for Phase 1 and even then it is not a massive upgrade. I really do not understand where you are getting this information.
---
What server are you on :)
---
As an alliance player who hit 60 yesterday and was constantly murdered from 50-60, I vowed that I would kill the horde children. Last night I fullfilled my vows by setting upon the weak. I killed the calves in their pastures, the greenskins in their huts, the long toothes on their beaches, and the unatural in their crypts. For 3 hours the rivers ran red. One unliving spit on me as I was cutting him into pieces. I camped him for more than an hour. When his/friend 60 came I remained in stealth until they left. I continued killing him after. He logged off and didnt come back because today is a new day and I'm still watching his corpse.
---
Yea I don’t know why some people don’t realize this, it will be night and day
---
But BGs are pretty evenly matched. The dominant faction (horde) will switch to wpvp to have a constant advantage. Because easy is better than fun.
---
Some just sold for me actually 
---

---
THey have already been doing that for months, lol.
---
Say if u guys want me to constantly drink and waste time keep playing the way ur playing
---
Sounds like you are an "altoholic". There are some of us who just enjoy the grind to 60 more than gearing up once you get there so we always roll another alt.
---
You have a source on crit being better then hit before the 9% hit cap for ferals? I would be interested in reading up on that.
---
&gt;since there's no repercussions why not?
---
This. During the first week of honor people were ganking quest givers and any other NPC the could easily camp. Once week 2 came across and DK's started to count, people avoid it like the plague. 
---
If players gray to you were counted as a DK 99% of this type of camping would stop.
---
And I'm going to apply logic and common sense to my decisions rather than blindly following someone just because other people do. Different strokes.
---
My understanding for time has been that while it was ban-able under the old TOS at the time of Vanilla, the game falls under the current TOS, under which cross faction is 100% allowed because Blizzard has a built-in system which allows BNet users to communicate freely.
---
When I was tanking dungeons, if I waited too long after a pull the mage would start doing that thing where they start casting frostbolt and cancelling over and over and eventually they decided not to cancel the cast.
---
and Stalagg is even worse for us ally. Never can actually get 1v1's they are like cockroaches always swarming together
---
I played on Tich in vanilla, and STV &amp; WPVP  wasn't nearly as bad as it is in classic (granted bgs were a thing when I started playing). You could level just fine for the most part, it was just occasionally you got some asshole who would decide you would be his personal bitch until you got fed up enough to go level elsewhere.
---
Ironic making a strawman by calling my argument strawman. 
---
Nobody fuckin agrees with you because you refuse to acknowledge the root of the whole conversation and keep on with this tired “warrior pity party” bullshit. 
---
Even if you choose to protect your e-ego, I hope you learned something from all this.
---
Well, if you are getting gankd on your low lvls, just alert nearby 60s and have them deal with it.
---
Ganking lowbies was always a thing all the way up to cata at least.
---
Silverdragon also
---
If you need an extra 8% threat (that's what your threat would be with an additional 8% hit) to hold over your DPS, you're doing something wrong. You should be miles ahead of anyone in the current phase.
---
And if you ever need a boost, you pop a Manual Crowd Pummeler (50% threat increase for 30 seconds).
---
Bro it's does not cost anything. Even 1 silver would be a profit
---
While this is outright dishonorable, what's really to blame is an honor system that begs for malfeasance.
---
Nobody had any idea PvP would turn into what it has on the most unbalanced realms. With quadruple the players on the same amount of real estate PvP is a whole new beast. Quit trying to make people feel bad for wanting to play on a PvP realm and also wanting a balanced experience.
---
Love your news broadcast Morboh...
---
Eh... I suppose you could argue that we should all be hypervigilant and wearing PvP gear at all times in Phase 2, but there is a difference in kind between PvP and 'Suprise PvP.' With stealth, sap, stuns and vanish, rogues have the singular ability to infiltrate and loiter in normally safe areas, control the terms of the initial engagement, and from there the corpse campee is at a disadvantage due to lost buffs, partial health/mana pools, and the time it takes to get mounted up and moving again.
---
Not to mention, it rarely is a 1v1 of late...
---
I too am a fire-wielding bodybuilder living in a medieval castle, descended from godly constructs meant to preserve the planet in real life.
---
Pick a PVE server unless you want to get killed over and over without a way to defend yourself.
---
As for what side, race does not matter to much unless you want to min max.
---
As for role pick a class that can dps and go dps as it is way more forgiving. 
---
Healing and tanking require some more advanced knowledge wich you will partly get while leveling a dps.
---
My favorite classes are rogue, mage, warlock
---
Nice... is Teamspeak still a thing? (curious)
---
It's not the specific amount of honor that makes you gain ranks, it's rank points. Your honor gain is relative to everyone on your faction. Sure, you may be gettinh stomped, but so is everyone else.
---
Sorry, but from reading your comment it is hard to tell if you even know how the ranking system works.
---
Lol, unless you like repair bills you can suck it up and wait. This isn’t a race, it’s a game, and if you’re too impatient to even let your healer drink then Classic probably isn’t right for you.
---
Go back to retail, try-hard.
---
Than streamers will abuse the fuck out of it to blacklist certain players in mass.
---
&gt; If you don't have trinket, 
---
Not all class trinkets even break stuns.
---
Same here. My guildmates and i switched from Dragon's Call (PvP massacre) to Razorfen (Normal)
---
As there are more frequent "LFG deadmines" posts in /LFG i assume that there are at least some more refugees
---
I can see what you mean about it being a flawed system. The fixed points cost on certain items makes a lot of sense.
---
I can just see this ending up causing a whole lot of drama and just can’t quite decide how best to approach the issue. Apparently if I agree to this and then change my mind (ie bid heavily for a item I want instead of rolling off I’d be “ousted”)
---
No, it’s terrifying ;)
---
Items have set prices in our guild, everyone pays the same (within your class), so there's no colluding.
---
&gt;utilizing the window skip
---
What do you mean here? I know that the window skip is used in Lava runs, but it doesn't make sense here for it to be the same window.
---
As a fellow healer, let the dipshits die. The worst they can do is kick you, and then they get to try to scrounge up a healer for a partial run.
---
Zug zug
---
What do you think happens when they are sitting in que for longer than 30 minutes?
---
We’ll see how you like DKP when a holy paladin takes ToEP and Mageblade from you.
---
Took me like a solid two days of wiping and barely having any successful runs to get the hang of it. Really glad I stuck it out. Once you got it you got it and you’ll make bank.
---
Exactly that. Before next big pull when the healer need to top up his mana, you sit and eat, cannibalize or bandage so we can keep going fast. When you have bandaged to 100% you hear a woh-woh-woh \*bam\* 1500 heal and then the healer sit down and drink. So facepalm.
---
Even better is dot-dot-dot, lifetap, drain life, and the priest puts a PW:S for 500 mana on you in panic. "Manabreak please" is the next thing you hear after the pull.
---
It’s only reserved if it’s higher than level 30 I believe, I know for a fact it works like that on retail according to blue posts not sure about classic tho
---
Zandalar tribe is pretty good. If you're leveling.... 
---
Holy fuck stay away from the fucking bulwork its a war zone.
---
But aside from that 50-50 ish pop, plenty of people doing rp events and shit.
---
/join World
---
/join LookingForGroup
---
You're supposed to shave your neck, btw.
---
The settings when you type in /who and it says on top “Zone”.
---
So the game, the game told me.
---
Yeah, this is spot on. There’s a reason why pve servers are labeled “normal” servers. 
---
You are right about the reality being that most people would enjoy the normal server setting. The game was balanced around pve, not world pvp.
---
Why do mages care about your shadow debuff
---
I retract my statement and defer to your server's superior fishing industry. On Kirtonos you get maybe 35s per for cooked.
---
\#blacklist
---
ganking these influencers off the server is the that has happened in classic so far.
---
This tracks total characters, not total accounts.
---
This, as well as others, are also 3rd party and unofficial and - at best - to be taken as an indicator, not a fact. Perception is reality, I guess, and your perception unfortunately is incredibly muddy.
---
Yeah no this is literally the only reason. I love classic. But if I can't experience the world because I'm doing corpse runs 90% of the time from griefing players then what's the point? I'll come back when I get the vibe from this subreddit that things have cooled down and I can actually level in my 50s. Whether or not battlegrounds will be the solution everyone is praying for will only be told in time.
---
I haven't seen a single fire mage in phase 2? Almost all mages on our server play CS deep frost(objectively best PVP spec for a mage), and a few have fun with pom pyro. Not a single mage in top 3 brackets on our server actually plays fire. Unless you mean elemental mage?
---
Talking about BiS for a meme spec is a little ridiculous. Even then, I fail to see how 1% crit makes that BiS for a elemental mage. It still relies on shatters, making crit nearly worthless as a stat. 
---
And alteric valley comes out in 10 days, meaning even by your logic it'll get obsolete in the next 2 weeks.
---
I hope you get bored into unsubbing, then.
---
It was nowhere near as bad, there was far less people and people were nowhere near as organised, it had far less of an impact on the game.
---
Also 10 times more expensive
---
Mageblade is Paladin BiS!
---
These clueless guys don’t get it. 
---
Instead of offering tank services, just go profession gathering or clear SFK for shadow fangs to sell. You still get money and all the fools can spend their time complaining in trade there are no tanks.
---
Yeah it’s hard to decide if I pop a frost pp or a fap though T _ T I gotta look for where to get the shadow one
---
Imagine thinking raiding old content in a 15 year old game is somehow hard to achieve or am accomplishment of any kind.
---
"Go play PvE!"
---
"You're just going to willfully imba the servers!"
---
A little indecisive, aren't we?
---
Not for warriors. Even on private servers where hit mattered more for them since the HS thing wasn’t around they weren’t using the Ony neck until Naxx if they could avoid it.
---
He also meant this AQ neck: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21664/barbed-choker
---
Get this guy over to BRM and take a screenshot saying "I have the highground."
---
Are you a mage?
---
Plus enchanting mats take up a shit load of space, and it makes your copy-paste longer if you have to include prices of everything in trade.
---
First these mobs dropped honor, now they just drop subs.. nerfed too much!!
---
It's really not though. Lol
---
playing skeram alliance is like you were a level 1 mob in a starting zone the night of launch. just hundreds of zerging idiots fucking pummeling you the moment you show up alive
---
So your guild burns hundreds, maybe thousands, of gold per MC run?
---
Other things to add:  
---
Curse of agony is useless, in fact dots are all pretty useless. Corruption is acceptable (if there are 15 or fewer debuffs on the boss)
---
Avoid using a pet, they will die instantly or worse, pull mobs by accident.  
---
20 shards is fine, drain soul on every mob, just in case. Find out who the tanks are, trade them a HS at the start of raids. If the group wipes on a boss, ask them to trade you for a stone, it isn’t mandatory tho.
---
It is interesting to see how the meta has shifted to DPS-centric AOE spam compared to vanilla's cautious teamwork tank/healer focus. Hell, I have yet to see anyone mention an MA (main assist), I doubt most would even know what that means or what that assignment in the raid frame is even used to denote and why such a special designation on the same level as the main tank would even be needed. The OP is a symptom of that. It has taken entirely too long for healers to realize their leverage, should it ever come.
---
Back in my day healers only healed the tank. They literally did not heal any DPS, ever, period, end of story. If a DPS took damage it was their fault. There are obvious caveats like AOE damage and other encounter specific damages, but by and large DPS incoming damage was from them taking cleaves because they didn't understand they are no longer soloing, or the concept of attacking from behind, or they simply stood in the fire. You got a stone if there was a lock and all of your heals were bandages and pots.
---
This wasn't some petty passive aggressive stance, this was a necessity. Long fights like Golemagg could require the healers be split into two groups, one that was healing and one that was wanding and regening mana.
---
I think a better focus for a Classic Plus WoW would be to simply increase mob health and damage output to put us back into the group focused game vanilla actually was instead of being kited around by eager DPS.
---
With the content trivialized by starting at patch 1.12 Classic is a bust for the legitimate gameplay of vanilla; but it is still heads and shoulders better than WoD and BfA were and have been.
---
Whoops, my bad, I misread it. I don’t reed real good
---
I've been exalted for a couple of months, and I recon alot of other tanks have aswell.
---
Server populations on some private servers were quite large, many times bigger than og vanilla. Still nothing like this happened.  Server pop size is only one factor that makes the main factor, faction balance, snowball out of control, since there's nowhere for the minority faction to hide. 
---
Your dismissal of the private server model is utterly idiotic. It's literally an unchanged version of the 15 year old game. And truth be told, the Nostcore servers were more accurate than Classic.
---
Private servers like Nost are literally the closest comparable to Classic. And you say they're irrelevant?  And you condescend about it?  My God your skull must be heavily sloped and several meters thick. 
---
Private servers provide proof that Blizzard is incompetent and they fucked the game up. Amateurs living in their parents basements got it right. These silk stockinged cunts can't tell the difference between their head and their ass.
---
That might be possible, I don't think I've taken names from lvl &gt;30 characters in years.
---
Maybe the reservation is still battle.net account wide or something?
---
I quit that shit show of a server 2 days after phase 2. Not fun.
---
Like I said, this has nothing to do with honor. There is no honor involved. So what are you getting at?
---
Pick the populated side of an imbalanced server. It'll be great in the long run.
---
..is it the razor hill ghosties?
---
I always liked the ogres on the mountain in burning steppes myself.
---
You can make characters of both factions on pve servers
---
I was that Holy Paladin in vanilla
---
TB has the bank, AH, mailbox, and flight master all in a line. UC has the AHs on the flanks, the bank center, the MB off to the side, and the FM is often overlooked since the bats are tucked into the corner and can be missed in a quick glance. For my money , TB all day.
---
Same. I even got the epic sword from Baron after some 50-100 runs.
---
It hasn’t just been me, dude, it’s a LOUD majority speaking against you. Why you so fragile?
---
I doubt that most people enjoy the grind to rank 14, they enjoy the gear.
---
I am sorry to hear this. Many people complain about corpse camping. If the target is green, I totally get it, people want to farm honor. If you pay, you're getting killed.
---
But killing/camping lowbies who don't pay is just stupid and evil. People who do that just want to ruin the game for others. The only solution I can think of is gray targets giving dishonourable kills, but people might abuse that as well.
---
I guess the only thing you can do is be patient.
---
What? We’re alliance... I play a human lock and my gf plays a human Paladin and we’re both offered transfers every time we sit in queue. Definitely don’t have to be horde
---
This
---
I don't tank in classic, enjoying healing. I tanked with a druid for many years, would always have a chat with the healer as we're about to start the run, "I'm not taunting off dps that pulls, don't heal them"
---
Dps learns quickly or they get kicked
---
That is a possibility even with the hit cap. You can never remove dodge and parry from the table, even if you remove miss.
---
The only way to get around that is to have DPS that pays attention to the threat meter. If they're already paying attention to the threat meter, they will notice an extra miss or two at the start of the fight. Missing won't hurt you in the long run.
---
Once those people get a taste for rolling, they'll roll anyone and everyone. The honor is what kicked off the wide scale behavior.
---
Honestly, I think that world PvP shouldn't give honor points once BG's are released. This shit shouldn't be encouraged.
---
I always tank fast as fuck and just watch mana 🤷‍♀️
---
It's the same on Harod.  I figured this was normal.  Is it not?
---
Just because you don't see any Ele mages on your server, doesn't mean they don't exist. And its not a meme specc. People need to stop following stupid guides and BiS lists and think for themselfes again. Anyway you still have to fill two rings slots. So either get the one from Kazzak (pretty easy I guess lol) or get this really hard to get ring which has a 100% dropchance on a raid boss you can do with 20 ppl every 5 days.
---
With my gear I get around 25% crit, 35% on scorch/fireblast, 3,8k hp and around 280+ firedmg, can kill any class/specc I want and don't have to worry about getting oneshotted by rogues.
---
lol I'm so sick of this argument, first of all I'm a druid, I do just fine. 
---
Secondly, there is a distinct difference between what PvP is designed to be and what is happening on the servers. PvP isn't designed to lock a large portion of the population out of content, that defeats the purpose of designing a subscription based game.
---
Aren’t there other trinkets you can use in its place? I don’t have a HoJ but I use the +2% crit trinket and the +1 hit +20atk trinket
---
Yeah, ganking was. Camping someone for 8 1/2 hours without getting any honor or anything at all is was not.
---
Well BGs are crossrealm. So, queues should not take 30 min
---
Lmao right
---
It gets worse when you hit 49, cos that's when you start being worth honor to 60s.
---
You haven't pointed that out at all. You've simply said that some players would find it inconvenient. 
---
Yes, it would be. For some players. 
---
For the overall health of the game, it would be the best thing to happen to it.
---
If they show up enough to have the DKP to get the item, and the raid continues to allow the "meme" spec, then I see no problem. DKP is the fairest system there is.
---
There’s so many things wrong with this idea
---
I cast regrowth + reju after he pulled and cast drinking right after before 'getting in combat'. That way you heal &amp; drink
---
Mageblade is BIS for holy pally and has amazing stats for them. They are the best healers in the game for static fights so yeah they should definitely be allowed to roll on mageblade
---
nope. guilds should be all for promoting collaboration between players. 
---
The bigger question is why you wouldn't have a fixed price dkp system, or some other better loot distribution scheme
---
/stopcasting works.
---
Weird, it gives me the option
---
Ah I figured it would be something like that.
---
Redundant titles are the best.
---
&gt; doesn't matter if you have overpower
---
If I recall correctly, overpower can only be used in defensive stance, right?
---
For those who are playing as a warrior for the first time, chances are they're foregoing it because they don't like being in defensive stance and don't know stance dancing is one of the things a warrior does (heck, I didn't know it until recently and I leveled a warrior to 60 in vanilla (and yes, I played terribly as warrior)).
---
I remember in WSG (back in vanilla) rogues would sap me to get the flag, then I'd break sap with enrage and warstomp to cancel their capture (but only after a suitable amount of time had passed so I can get the message out to my teammates and to give them a few seconds to move over), and then the rogues would flee. *If only they knew I had no idea how to play my class and that they could've curb stomped me if they decided to stick around and fight it out*.
---
"50% more" is what you say to make it sound important, its still only 3% less phys dmg instead of all resis and 765 mana. if thats "a big deal" to you thats your choice, but its just not. 
---
The blue one is just not worth the effort for anyone whos raiding because its at best equivalent to t1. 
---
The epic one is not reachable for most people.
---
My arguement still stands, there is no reward for healers thats worth it from pvp, atleast if youre not in shitty gear to begin with or wanting it for the DPS side of it.
---
It's not in there. If you are so confident, point it out.
---
thats a shame. your healers have to be good not incredibly geared. good gear helps ofc but its more of a skill thing/knowing your stuf
---
Its in the game, so its a fair playstyle.
---
If you get campde for 8 hours, and your faction does nothing to stop it. Well, then you are just playing the game wrong.
---
spriests are in a weird spot. Shadow weaving is very useful as long as you have more than just a couple locks.
---
HOWEVER
---
You could make a holy priest spec into shadow weaving and keep it up, while still primarily being a healer.
---
But most laid back guilds would rather not force a healing priest to do that and would instead bring a shadow priest.
---
While boomkins are just pretty trash, the 3% spell crit at least technically can't be subbed out for by a resto druid. Now you could just bring another mage/lock instead of the boomkin and the difference in damage would be more than what 3% crit gives to the 4 caster party members... but thats another story.
---
One thing I have heard is that you could cut every resto druid since they are mediocre and their HoT's take up buff slots. So you could bring a boomkin as your Mark of the Wild giver and just bring no resto druids. But that has other absurdities going for it...
---
1 month too late, I'm afraid
---
Have fun on that pve server with bwl on farm and no pvp.... No thanks, I'd rather go on a pvp server and maybe suffer a couple of weeks than playing ponytail-raidlogging pve servers. 
---
You will get bored on those pve servers, trust me.
---
That’s definitely what his car is.
---
Grind your way to commander. Buy the pvp mount.
---
key is pop a FPP early if you have an idea you're gonna be going vs a mage but yeah. i rarely FAP against mages but ik warriors HAVE to lol
---
Fresh player, I reached lvl 46 without doing single STV quest. There are other places you can level up.
---
Having said that, if you can party up with some people, it can be a nice experience.
---
not when you only need 6 hit and p4 and later youre swimming in it

i'm playing on grob. very populated. very even server, probably the most even if not then close.
---
Get leatrix while you're at it, it allows you to view the world map in a window (you can choose the size) instead of taking up the whole screen.
---
Ok just did. Sucks but what else can you do
---
Without decay, new people would just come in and win everything,  wouldn't they?  Using your example, if you have 900 EP, and 900 GP, then you are at 1.   The next raid comes along, and you dont get anything.   Now, you have 930 EP/ 900 GP = 1.03333333333.   Your priority basically didn't move at all.

&gt;secret knowledge of vanilla

Dreamweave Vest and Gloves did originally give a random amount of spelldamage when you equipped them, and a different random amount when you unequipped them. In theory, if you did this enough times you could probably get lots of spelldamage (logging out if you ended up with a large negative instead).Tested around April 2005 (I remember doing it around the WSG entrance while waiting for a BG to pop, maybe on the public test realm). They eventually changed them to a constant amount.
---
Why just the Alliance? There are multiple PVP servers that are heavily Ally dominated.
---
whats the alternative? alliance is unplayable, which is already killing guilds / servers. then alliance can say what horde has been saying to alliance "just reroll lol"
---
Unfortunately it was sent to me by my fallen comrade so I couldn’t control that aspect
---
Can confirm hahaha. I think it's my 8th week not seeing it. I'll save my bitching for the game tho. Rip
---
&gt;do you just let them die? 
---
Not a healer, but as a tank, I do this.
---
If someone pulls a mob before I do, they must want it bad enough to be ready to die for it. I'm not gonna take that away from them.
---
As a warrior tank, I have had dps that charge in before I pull (because I’m waiting for the healer to get mana). Maybe it’s because I’m leveling an alt and everyone below lvl 60 is antsy right now?
---
Wtf are these downvotes? 40/44ap &gt; 1% hit every day of the week for pve, you're gonna be soft capped from other gear regardless. PvP is a different story.
---
"The Alliance can roll us if they group" /gets downvoted
---
Jesus christ.
---
I'm much more concerned that the gm is encouraging this behavior without just making it guild policy to have a low price and roll off for tier items. It does not bode well for the guild that the gm would behave in this subversive fashion. I joined the top guild on my server/faction and we use loot council. I've seen that go wrong so many times, but it's working like a charm. I feel like everything has been quite fair. It helps that we have two mc teams and run 20man onyxias. Splitting ony groups is a tactic I'd highly recommend to every guild btw. It's really not any harder, and you get more chances at t2 helms, sinew and viskag/ deathbringer.
---
Sean Spicer? Is that you?
---
There is nothing you can do if your faction has half the amount of players as the other.
---
I can disagree with many people at once, it's a talent of mine.
---
\*Raid. This shit has saved our raid a few times.
---
What if you are DR'd? Theres no reason to kill them. They are just killing other of your faction that won't steal your honor anymore cause they are dead
---
So that chart is just assigning a value to hit that is lower then crit. It is not actually showing why or a sim with crit vs hit. Missing a shred isn't just about the energy cost but the time cost. If you have a 1 minute boss fight wasting global cool downs on recasting shred is a straight dps loss. I am not an expert on cat dps but I don't really think its a simple issue to dismiss hit as equal to cirt.
---
/equipslot 13 &lt;trinket&gt;
---
And this is why DKP is a terrible system
---
What trouble do you have? Just run the initial setup and you are done.
---
Protip: should have rolled a rogue lmao.
---
I seriously thought about re rolling haha
---
So Horde on PVP servers are punished even if they arent contributing to the issue? 
---
Herod was balanced before Alliance left.
---
But was there a quid pro quo?!
---
After they removed layers they came back on the heavily populated servers
---
2 warriors i know do SM boost runs...
---
They have distracting Shot the primary target threat spike and multishot on pull for aoe threat, preventing heal aggro, with improved aspect of the monkey for a big boost to dodge chance for constant survivability boost.
---
However, the real deal, is they have Pets to eat cleaves and chain lightnings so it doesn't tag players.
---
Sounds like the best tank possible.
---
Horde attracts the sadistic edgy 4chan types for sure. I know because I'm in a guild with a bunch of them.
---
I would totally do that if I hadn't invested close to 2k gold if not more into armorsmithing or I could drop Engi for mining :/
---
Oh yea, there just needs to be a new mmo but the genre is kinda dead. Pantheon? I think it’s called looks decent, ESO PvP is actually pretty good too tbh.
---
Imagine being so tight assed you cant take a joke
---
A lot of people do care about the leveling experience. I’d say for most people that’s what Classic is all about
---
lol "it happens on both sides". make a video like this from horde perspective on your server and prove it.
---
If he doesn't leash, couldn't you kite him to some far off place and permasheep?
---
Alliance heavily tilted some servers in their favor by transferring off. 
---
Let me know when yall ask for transfers off these servers.
---
dkp is a loot system for shit guilds
---
You're telling me that *all* horde across *all* realms in *all* regions would just say "happens, that's just pvp" after being corpse camped for 8 1/2 hours by people who aren't getting honor from you with no counter-play because your server has twice as many on one faction?
---
I hate locks that tap like fucking crazy in instances.   Sometimes I heal the lock more than the tank.  WTF are you doing over there?!
---
Hahahhah 69 amiright ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I love the horde faction because durotar is the best place for duelIng. I just did not like how cramped the duel zone outside of iron forge was.
---
We dont like discord all together, so yeah, we use TS3 with our own 500 slot server
---
sure, but the pvp implications of spying like this wouldn't be there on a pve realm.
---
Transmutes are horrible profit. 5g per 2 days. That's 912g per year.
---
You can make more by buying mats on the weekend and crafting a ton of raid items and sell on reset day.
---
I myself make around 30s profit per arrow stack I sell (engineer) And I make dozens of stacks in a few mins.
---
You can make more gold on one toon in a month than Transmuting will make on multiple toons in a year.
---
P.S. For what it's worth, I'd advise leveling one toon to 60 first so you can grind gold more effectively and spoil the other toons with BoEs.
---
It will get old soon. People didnt do this before the worst designed pvp system in the history of mmorpgs was introduced, so when bgs come out they will get bored of pvp. Maybe they still cling to some sort of hope that they can actually get decent ranks...
---
They mean since the warrior has proper gear (head/chest, others), the ring is just to mess with people.
---
Why would you want to miss more then you needed to though? I don't want my dps to need to slow down the faster the fight is over the better. I am not really giving up much in most cases by going for hit. On fights where threat doesn't matter (kill order) I can just switch around my threat and mitigation gear.
---
I am out of the loop here, even after reading a Lot of the comments. What is ToS? And what is the problem in this post?
---
Companies are made of people. These people are not computers which automatically take actions which will secure the most profit.
---
Still no changes still enjoying it, will also enjoy when bgs get added it's not a huge deal just don't want retail whiners to ruin vanilla again.
---
ALREADY?
---
ALREADY!
---
They use the "war" as justification for being dicks.
---
I'm not new, and I recognize the situation really sucks for the people on the losing side of the unbalanced PVP servers... But I think we all know that blizzard isn't going to fix it
---
stop blaming other faction for it. people camp there not specifically to kill lowbies, they have no chance for pvp at all because they can't find allience anywhere. it is blizzards' fault to not do anything for balance. imagine you are a horde and you need honor, what you gonna do? everywhere is already full of your race and you gotta find a way. 
---
bg's will prob fix that a little bit.
---
When ever I boost in low-level dungeons (as a warrior) I also get whispers sometimes from people complaining that *a mage would do it both faster and cheaper*. - To which I reply: *Yes I know, I cant compete with their efficiency. This is my rate, pay it or move on with your day, find a mage*.
---
I still get people who need boost because the demand seem to be higher than the supply.
---
How is it more efficient?   Surely level 55  mage water is better than 45 food?  Also, you have several GCDs worth of taps to just get your mana mostly full.
---
Gear is about the same while you lvl up anyways. It has agi, it has lots of armour? Sounds like bear gear.
---
If youre doing 45 dps, you are probably around lvl 25 ish, and you could easily tank as kitty as well. An actual tank isnt required till you hit ST or similar.
---
It's only one guild, Relaxed doing that.
---
Rogues are by far the best 1v1 class if only because of the most overpowered pvp spell in the game: stealth.
---
The duels you other classes winning involves them knowing exactly who they're fighting and being almost fully prepared to fight them (correct trinkets, items, etc). Also, rogues can't simply sprint and run away because of the dueling area limit, so they often sprint, reach the edge of the duel, and wait there while the enemy catches up with them and prevent them from resetting.
---
Dueling gives a very poor picture of what actual wpvp look like.
---
Let's say another alliance comes down to stand with them, and leech honor. That is 25% of the groups honor gone to a random. Having the horde there to kill the none guild alliance let's thier group get the full honor on anything that walks through.
---
Thunderclap spec
---
crippling poison
---
Literally this. Gj blizz even when you try to fix stuff you break something
---
That's understandable.
---
Thanks, but I'm specifically asking about methods I haven't already mentioned in my post..
---
Its hilarious how people are so serious about the easiest pve in wow history.
---
So, what they're doing is shitty and all, but... bruh. Chillll
---
1x tank, 1x random dps, 1x healer. One of you need to be a miner for the rich thorium veins at the end. The rest dont matter. Bonus if one is an enchanter though to DE the trash, but vendoring alone combined with the thorium veins will net you 30-50g/hour on average. I find that 2x warriors and 1x paladin works perfectly.
---
I tried to do that, my priests lost their fucking mind that I said no to them bidding on it. So now it's open to everyone.
---
Dude, a lto of these people are killing you when your'e honorless because they want to fuck with you. BG's won't help removing those fucksticks.
---
Can I get a link to it? I'm on that blessed server too :)
---
You need to be very short sighted to think Q's will last longer than 30 minutes in a game where BGs are crossrealm and there is  hundreds of thousands of players.
---
Sell it.
---
Even if you really really want the spell power, you’re better off literally just buying the Sp enchant on a good wep. Not that I’d recommend that, but you could.
---
The mobs in RFK are considerably weaker than those in SM. So weak you can use clothies as tanks :/
---
\^ this.
---
But your fun is taking a toll on others that‘s the issue. Imagine rogues coming with pvp spec tanks tanking with 2 handers Warlocks using their every single curse to fill up those useful buff spots etc. just because it’s fun for them. Imagine what kind of raid that would be? Even in casual raids people are carrying you moreever than usual.
---
Lot cheaper? For the mats a Chili is 1-1.5g, an oil is 25s-35s.
---
Dynamite and oil are more reliable.
---
Sounds about right. 
---
I had 3 friends talk about nothing but how hyped they was for Classic and how it was the Golden Era of WoW. I'm on the other side (Especially since ive seen their gaming habit on live. Buying boosts ect...) telling them No it really wasn't, Class balance was bad, Honor system was bad, Leveling was a slog, Raids were ez by today standards ect...
---
I remember a time before Nos when it was well agreed upon TBC took Vanilla and made it not shit but that's a different discussion
---
Anyway guess who all quit by lvl 33.
---
You only get +4% crit on scorch/fireblast from talents. So obviously it goes to from 25 to 35 magically. Lol.
---
Also your 25% crit suggests you PvP with trash items like +2% crit trinket and spell mastery gloves - in addition to nearly full BiS gear. That's the only way to reach 25%, or else you're just straight up bullshitting.
---
You want to know how much damage is going from 74 to 75% crit? 1.74/1.75 = 0.57% damage increase. That's literally nothing. 4 spellpower would be more impactful on a fireball under these conditions. 
---
I'll tell you straight up. Frost mage in decent hands in this kind of gear would easily win the majority of 1v2's and 1v3s. That you're proud of not losing 1v1s is a complete joke with those stats. But that's a fire mage for you. Shooting yourself in a foot without realizing it.
---
&gt;That awkward moment when the feral druid pipes up that he needs Accuria 
---
Why is that even in contention? 
---
Our ferals (plural) aren't just providing 3% Crit to the melee groups, buffs and Brezz, they also outperform everyone but warriors in DPS. 
---
We just a 44 second Shazzrah kill where kittens were ranked #1 and #4.
---
Only shitters use vendor arrows
---
Fucking loot counsil. I am passed over for gear by rogues who has better gear than me but doing way less damage. I don't understand the logic.
---
Sigh. *walks on* ok dude.
---
THE MEAT BE TALKING TA MUCH
---
Wouldn't a loot council also give Mageblade to the paladin? It's a great +Healing sword and healers tend to be regarded as more important to gear up than the DPS.
---
Well with the faction swap option like retail, you won't need to level again, but your shammy would become a paladin if you swapped.
---
Considering the 2:1 or greater servers are almost equally split (Horde has one more dominated server than Alliance. I lost what I was keeping track on but I think its 5 Ally favored to 6 Horde favored), yes. The Horde arent posting here en masse because this PVP happens.
---
Sounds exactly like the alliance guards outside of the boats.
---
I think the difference lies in the circumstances and motivation. In your situation, you are actively helping each other (both benefiting) while no other player is impacted. In the other example they are also working together but other players are heavily impacted. 
---
But in practice, yes, they could absolutely do that (but I highly doubt they will)
---
&gt;Name a more iconic duo
---
Playing Alliance and doing the same when you're the dominant faction?
---
Speaking as a warrior with tens of thousands of play hours, both as protection, fury,  and prot-fury hybrid you can't always trust pug healers to keep you up if you go balls to the wall HAM dualwield-tanking. I do it often if I feel the healer can keep up, but more often than not I keep my shield on.
---
Just ignore him,  he's biased.  All horde say this because the status quo suits them.
---
Considering they released the R14 weapons, which only arrived with patch 1.11 (e.g. the caster dagger and healer mace), I think there should be a good chance the leggings are available imemdiately too.
---
At least, it would feel pretty silly to me, to make 1.11 blue sets and 1.11 r14 weapons available, but skimp on the pvp reputation rewards
---
Yeah it was normally 1 or 2 rogues doing it. Theres like 15 rogues in IF every night.
---
I mean the item is dogshit on any kind of paladin so it would make sense that he’s mad that he almost lost his rare BiS to some waterbrain who doesn’t know how his class works
---
Those aren't on the Zeppelins, you could've just gone in-game and debunked it in 2 minutes lol
---
The average priest doesn't understand this , so they either ignore completely the warlock forcing them to downtime with eating, or start telling you the "you should drink like every other class".
---
I didn't realize how bad warlocks have it until I started leveling an alt. I'm level 43 and jesuschrist... it's always priests that complain about this. All it literally takes is casting a renew before you start drinking, and tossing them a heal now and again in medium-long enoucnters, and they are happy with that.
---
Right, the bad itemization, unbalanced factions, broken spells, and exploitable behavior is perfect.  Sure mate.  Don't trip over your feet, those rose colored glasses are a bit thick.
---
take my upvote and fuck off
---
The "mystery" was not whether up-to damage type gives static bonus based on coefficients, but rather whether green "of Wrath" items are somehow superior by not following the 3.5s coefficient rule. Curious about dreamweave, started playing for real closer to summer 2005 and i dont believe it was a thing anymore.
---
Yeah as someone who has leveling Horde and Alliance in Classic Horde have it way smoother. I'll take kill 10 of X mob quests over n over that is time effective than run from X NPC to X NPC in X zone back to X NPC n X zone.
---
And because Horde get so many Grind quests they get more freedom to skip ass quests since they're generally doing well in the Xp department from grinding quests. The Alliance do not get that luxury you're generally scrambling to find quests to do from 30-45.

Clip out the guards? I'm showing the entire boat. Those are not on the boat lol. They're on the dock outside of the boat, just like the alliance guards outside the boats. So no matter how you twist this, you're still a liar lil bud.
---
Let us think about this for a second. He states, that he has 9 times more honour than you. If that statement is true, he will have spent a considerable (probably A LOT as you state, he camps FPs which is awful honour) longer time playing. His next statement is that stupid people (assuming he refers to those who contributes little value to society) should be exterminated.
---
Now, I believe the 2 assumptions above are conflicting. As, if he spent 9 times longer playing WoW than you did (time spent probably angering other players, mind you), who is actually contributing the least amount of value to society here?!
---
To be fair WSG not having a time limit is kinda dumb.  
---
Premades and people who know how honor farming works won't camp a graveyard for 30 minutes, but people who manage to stomp will, same as they do in the open world.  
---
I honestly don't see any downsides to WSG being limited to 15 minutes, but either blizzard's laziness or the nochanges specials will probably prevent this.
---
You can cleanse or freedom consussion shot, you can freedom wing clip. Against scatter shot only bubble helps, but the duration isn't long enough for the hunter to get away.
---
&gt;Only the strong will remain, while all the pacifists will be filtered out, and that may be a good thing.
---
meanwhile all the fotm kiddies roll horde and then trash talk alliance with their non-existent 1400 rating achievements. Don't worry, me and the few other alliance players afking in Ironforge on Skeram will retake our capitals with sticks, stones and harsh language
---
Damage classes only, not for supports.
---
&gt;Does it say ON the boat? No, it says they need guards LIKE the zep.
---
It has guards outside of the boat though, so it is the exact same thing right now 🤣
---
I agree with the sentiment that at some point being killed 5+ times is your own fault, but some servers really are this bad. Even my 'balanced' one I don't level my 51 alt if it's not rested, and then can only really grind mobs or do dungeons.
---
A major problem is that the prime leveling range for getting farmed (48-58) are also in hot zones with already sparse or tough quests with unforgiving corpse runs at times, making it even worse when you're getting killed. I  did half of Searing Gorge on my alt before p2, and afterwards it took me 30 minutes to go from Thorium to the outhouse for the key turnin.
---
Sure, you always got camped, and I'd argue that low levels (&gt;48) have it easier now since 60s have 0 reason to camp unless they're shit or think killing level 20s is more fun than honor farm squad skirmishes.
---
Idk what I'm even trying to say but it was  tough to level even before p2 was out, and I honestly can't be sure I wouldn't quit if I didn't already have a 60 and a few alts to rotate through so I'm sympathetic towards people with even less time, though they should also realize that WoW is a no life game filled with no lifes so they can't be shocked when someone camps a spot for 12 hours a day, shit happens.

"you're gaining a advantage" as in there's a whole set of loot I need ontop of about half the fury warrior loot to do effective &amp; am supposed to spend dkp on?
---
If we'd do a bidding war we just end up all going constantly into "negative" dkp because fury warriors don't need tier, they don't need a shield, 
---
half their best in slot gear still comes from dungeons who I dragged their behinds through over and over because they need their items?
---
On the pieces of loot where dkp actually matters we bid like every one of you, on the rest we just use a internal loot council to decide whom bids on it. (something you guys can't do effectively because there'd always be a ashhole dps who wants their big duck dps to be slightly bigger &amp; will ninja outbid, while we're a actual team that's coordinated and well oiled and appreciated) 
---
Not to realise that we're already disadvantaged on the pieces of loot that actually matter because we had to spend dkp on a whole load of crap you don't need?
---
_______
---
Dkp was originally designed by entitled dps who think they're the most important butt in the raid.
---
Newscheck, ya not, if you die the kill will probably still be a kill, if you're under geared you will do less dps &amp; the boss will die a bit slower, if you can't come to a raid we'd still run it that night. 
---
If I die it's likely a wipe, if I'm under geared you will complain I don't keep agro because I can't do eneugh threat per second to please you, making your precious gear essentially useless, if I can't make a raid that raid will likely be canceled 
---
_________
---
Edit: guess who's right now taking 4 ppl whom need stuff through scholo and is going to ubrs to farm 3 truestrike shoulders and 2 main hands because there's dps whom need them?
---
To every a side of a story there's a b side.
---
Edit2: if found out dps are colluding and actually pulling that off they'd be slapped with a - 100 dkp (equal to a full raid of dkp)
---
You may be able to find an herb/mining duo partner but if not then your options are pretty limited as a warrior. Open world farming is slow and you have no gathering professions. You could always farm strat live for righteous orbs
---
I don't see why BRM would change at all. You could take out half the horde and allies would still have 10 res walks to BRD.
---
But group 1 and 2 won't be clearing at the same time. Group 1 will be the °good° raid and 2 will be the meh one. 
---
Also it doesn't really help us at all to have a second raid. Not worth the headache.
---
&gt; at best
---
Again I looked a week ago. 
---
&gt; when the addon worked
---
The addon has been working. There was an update to the curseforge page on November 15th. The same page that explains the fixes. So even if the fixes were just in the last update (they were well before that) the census data from a week ago would be generated using the updated addon.
---
Because the pvp system is a huge pile of shit.
---
Att least try to make it look somewhat legit.
---
What will horde be doing while the endless waiting queues?
---
10-15g is low af for a 1-2 hours commitment, assuming ofcourse you do it soley for the gold and dont need any loot from 5mans anymore.
---
Ret paladins are just fucking embarrassing from head to toe and they still don't fucking get it.
---
It's not 2019 my guy, web pages domt have to be updated manually by hand.
---
Armor rings really aren't much better if you're tanking. Your best-case for single-target is Ring of Protection (150 armor, 9 sta) and Heavy Dark Iron Ring (110 armor, 20 sta, som def skill). Taking off Ring of Protection currently takes me from 67% reduction to 65.5%. 1.5% 'avoidance' is worth losing for 2% hit and the increased dodge from Accuria.
---
Way less important, but compared to like water breathing it's great. It's an applicable end game passive ontop of other good abilities.
---
This is going in circles. That situation you are describing is still going to happen even if you are at the hit cap. Dodge and parry (which happen much more often than a miss, by the way) can never be removed from the hit table while you're tanking.
---
Your DPS always need to hold back at the start of the fight. If they don't, they're at risk of pulling threat to a bad dodge/parry combination. Hit cap or not.
---
same if you have shadowform.
---
hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahah
---
oh wait, you're serious
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

"Taking a toll on others" ?

Dude vanilla raids are really easy, esp with the amount of knowledge and theorycrafting available. One mythic raid fight in retail alone has more mechanics than anything in vanilla.  It wont hurt to let people play the spec they want to.
---
And you know what, we probably carried a ton more people back then; afkers, keyboard turners etc. And it was still possible to clear raids. So again, if you wanna go hardcore go ahead. Friendships and a good guild/raid atmosphere is a lot more important than doing X% more dps to some of us.
---
Try hard about drinking? You’re kidding right?
---
The gate keeping is real.
---
Just explaining an easy way to overcome the problem he was noting so calm down with the toxic shit
---
&gt;Dude vanilla raids are really easy, esp with the amount of knowledge and theorycrafting available. One mythic raid fight in retail alone has more mechanics than anything in vanilla.  It wont hurt to let people play the spec they want to.

As the guy before me also said but you can not read I repeat it again: IT‘S BECAUSE OF OVERALL SPEED AND NOT BECAUSE OF PROGRESS. 
---
&gt; And you know what, we probably carried a ton more people back then; afkers, keyboard turners etc. And it was still possible to clear raids.
---
Weird flex but ok. Not anybody’s problem in classic wow, nobody owes you anything. 
---
&gt;So again, if you wanna go hardcore go ahead. Friendships and a good guild/raid atmosphere is a lot more important than doing X% more dps to some of us.
---
Implying good guild atmosphere and friendship just vanishes when you raid hardcore. Ayyyy
---
I'm not disputing. I just don't like loot council guilds in vanilla. Itemization is shit and only a tiny amount of useful loot ever drops.
---
Any good addon to check the range of your target? Playing a boomy and I need to stay out of fear range but in cast range of warlocks, which isn't easy to do... Thanks.
---
It is the best spec for pvp and also works really good as a leveling spec. Decent for tanking too
---
Looks like he is using black dragon scale 3 piece
---
It's spell crit, not hit.
---
fuck thats smart
---
hurr Paladin bad
---
meanwhile forums are full of complaints about ret paladins + hoj, granted using a macro for an exploit but hoj is still fantastic for ret and probably prot too I imagine.
---
On his own stream he isn't sniping and hardly kills Asmon. I don't watch Asmon much anymore, he's just as toxic as his chat. But funny enough, you're only talking from one perspective, you contributed nothing to this debate.
---
"Yeah. I'm affliction." Fit so well.
---
Actually shit not working properly for a week+ at a time and blizzard either not providing any communication regarding it or providing vague/mixed communication on it was in fact part of the classic experience.
---
release Sandlol so the faction with higher player count is force into silithus.
---
If you just raid log you wouldn't know about the final stretch to BRD would you?
---
Same. Unlocked lvl 40 perk of fury and I was like, wtf is this sh*tty skill? Switched to arms and I started to perform 50 better.
---
I can post a video later that shows how horde play on firemaw🤗
---
Min max culture
---
Haha nice! Mine isn’t that clever or funny but it’s named Kaepora (the owl from legend of zelda!)
---
I am confused, the title made it seem like they were honor trading. This just looks like two guilds that have formed a non aggression pact. When was this against TOS? To my knowledge things like this have always gone on. I think there are even cross faction pacts where horde guilds help ally get things like war chief world buff in exchange for things.
---
STEALTH PLAYER DETECTED
---
Yes, less significant.
---
Yeah Asmon is waiting for bgs to come out and will transfer to a pve server if it doesnt fix his issues or something
---
Im a horde on Flamelash, do you consider the pop really unbalanced? Just wondering.
---
Pvp aside, spotta ut gröten
---
Again, I linked the snapshot data back from wowhead, and it shows that Herold as 38% A  62% H, I would leave that server roflmao.
---
It may have been balanced at one point just because some people stopped logging in, but at launch is back in early Sept it was a hell hole for alliance. 
---
As to the logs not being complete, well yeah, it does not show anyone pre say 55 (really 60) and not all raiders log.
---
But what it does show is the trends. 
---
And I am not saying that this queue would be in place for the nice 50/50 servers, maybe not even enabled until there is a &gt;500 people imbalance (not a % IMO) with some fudge room. 
---
But if you are on some of these servers, yeah you will be punished. But that punishment will mean that come P3, the queues are not going to be as bad as things will be if they don't do anything. With alliance quitting instead of re-rolling.
---
2 flasks 6 elixers, a heap of juju, a heap of stoneshield potions, a healthy dose of fire water...
---
As a protection warrior you can't effectively farm anything solo (no heals and no damage), your best option is to level a dps to funnel money to your main with stuff like a mage in zf,... 
---
Repair in purple plate is also way more than repair in blues
---
We use it with a property sheet. Works well. No reason to not use it imo.
---
It's the one from the WoW interface, no Addon!
---
This post made me laugh pretty hard.
---
Smort. I never considered that on a warrior. But the boots are too expensive anyway.
---
All this math also applies to warriors. Spirit can make leveling far cleaner due to the regen it gives.
---
Hell, I had a Stam/Spirit healer chest for basically all of my leveling. It got replaced by... a fucking paladin chest cause it had more stam... and now it’s a Lightforged chest cause *normal chests don’t fucking exist*. It feels like it’s gunna take fucking might to break this curse.
---
I mostly notice it by the gloomy sound effect and the shadow particles floating around me...
---
Haha yeah people can be so dump sometimes. Great point!
---
Nobody's saying that he doesn't have the right to make a terrible, nonsensical choice.
---
The same way we have the right to laugh at him.
---
Morgans is a death trap for alliance. If horde kill you in there they will kill you 2 to 3 more times. before you can corpse run away.
---
Yea, you the rogue “Woo” ? XD
---
I don't kill people that cannot fight back.  Anyone that kills lowbies is just human trash.
---
&gt;What's with all the smiley faces? 
---
Look at the post I'm replying to.
---
&gt;People don't want to run census because they don't see any value in it for themselves, it isn't because of not wanting to see the truth or anything.
---
So they are happy to reiterate false information, but don't want to take an effort to validate such information? Ok then.
---
Reiterating the point:
---
&gt;It might be hard for you to believe, but most people who aren't on Reddit simply don't care very much.
---
They don't care very much, but they still participate in discussions about population and talk about being outnumbered (or the faction balance being "fine"). Can you explain this logic to me?
---
It's not against ToS. It used to be, but they took that line out of the ToS years ago.
---
I came to the conlusion the best thing you can do is actually find a lvl 35-43 Shaman, and let him clear his bags.
---
You go to cathedral, do 5 runs and when your bags are full he sells everything and gives you the gold until he has the same amount he had before.
---
The runs are free for him.
---
I do this with my brother and we net around 45-50g per hour.
---
I know you already know this, but probably a bit different, the thing is, even if I can easily farm elements in silithus (which I cant because I have to click through more free action potions than I actually earn gold because of all these god damn mages there), I wouldnt even make close to that amount, CONSISTENT!
---
Type /range &lt;value&gt;.
---
Arms is the #1 PvP spec for warriors.
---
Mortal Strike with a big 2-hander is good for burst damage. The healing debuff is very strong vs some classes. Improved overpower + 2-hander is great vs some classes. Sword spec / axe spec adds more burst potential. You get tac mastery as part of the package for stance dancing.
---
That said; warriors are generally fairly team-reliant. In 1v1, warriors have a lot of bad matchups. But in a group fight with support, warriors can go completely nuts.
---
&gt;You're ignoring the fact that in actual vanilla, alliance vastly outnumbered the horde.
---
Am I?
---
&gt; I'm not a fan of this topic in particular, but it's strange how Blizzard decided to tackle the vanilla faction balance **(which was in favour of the Alliance)**
---
That's just an example. Fights will actually last 5 minutes (and longer) when we get to the good raids. It's important to think about for when we get to that content.
---
I'm sure you can burn your mana on all currently available fights that aren't Domo, Rag, and Ony. You are most likely tanking on Domo, and Ony + Rag have so much downtime for melee DPS that the situation the other poster described doesn't apply.
---
None of those are good enough reasons for me to spend 50 gold.
---
Nah im wootsneak on firemaw but changed server week 2 cuz of quetimes.
---
Lmao we did the same to some progress bois.  They were standing by the standard hill in Feralas holding Mojache, we got around em and stood for a solid 2minutes looking at like a group of them, then just jumped the poor bastards.  
---
Glorious slaughter.
---
Dude it will. If people wanna be efficient it will. Because while people on my server are pulling 250k honor/week without bg‘s this will turn into 1mil honor/week with bgs. So if you wanna compete you better do bgs. The ones that are left are the ones having fun and not caring about any honor or are just there to satisfy their sadistic daily dosis by killing questers etc..
---
why even bring that up?
---
Oh okay. Wait what queue time?
---
Ok, here is my full train of thought as a warlock:
---
1) My class mechanics are pretty weird. Unlike mages, my high dps spells cost a shitload of mana. A lvl 60 warlock in greens and blues can cast 10-12 spells before draining his mana pool. That's usually one 3-4 mob  pack in a 5-man dung. That means, I drain my entire mana pool every pull. 
---
2) I have this amazing skill called Life tap that converts my HP into mana at 1.15 ratio. 1hp = 1.15 mana. I can then use my mana to replenish my HP pool with life drain and syphon life at a 1.4++ ratio (depending on spell damage). That is, I have a recurring positive loop where I can actually go infinite on HP/mana and never need heals or bandages or water. This all comes at the cost of DPS, because drain life ticks for like 100 at most. 
---
3) Healers convert mana into HP at a much higher ratio than a warlock. A 350 mana spell can give me upwards of 2000 HP. With life tap, that's almost full mana bar for me. A healer can replace 350 mana w/o even drinking and just by chilling for couple secs out of combat due to generally high mana regen from gear and talents. 
---
So, as per group efficiency in terms of making the most out of group resources, it's MUCH more efficient for healers to heal tapping warlocks. Warlocks then do maximum damage, packs die faster, and healers don't have to heal tanks and other group members as much because, well, warlocks do damage and kill things fast. 
---
In my personal experience, about half of the healers don't heal warlocks. They expect locks to bandage ourselves, or drink/eat between pulls like any other caster. Expect that EVERY other caster doesn't go OOM in one pull. In addition, mages have infinite free food, so even if they did, they would not care at all. 
---
I stopped giving a shit after like level 30. If I see a healer who ignores low HP tapping warlock (me), I just go on syphon and drain life rotation, like I would do if I were solo farming movs outside of the dungeon. This drops my dps into the drain, and I barely outdamage the tank. Surprisingly, nobody cares. There is a group member who can double or even triple their damage output potential, but 0 fucks given. Well, guess what, 0 fucks given back as well.
---
Unfortunately this is true for all sides though. I can't run around safely in UC, Booty Bay, or anywhere else without some etchy ganks. I would say "PVP attracts subhumans" instead, but perhaps someone playing on a PVE server can confirm that.
---
You know, that's super reasonable. Thanks for your input, I'll keep that in mind.
---
You've must not have had a 10 minute timer before lmao
---
20 overgeared super buffed up meganerds yeah.
---
Why should they wait endless queues?
---
&gt;Do I have that right?
---
No, you don't. I'm asking the person I'm replying to to count the amount of PVP and PVE servers and post it here, so he can try to support his claim (it doesn't stand). I'm also curious what's his latest census data, as I may have missed a wider recount.
---
I didn't :&lt;
---
The boots are BiS, so are the shoulders. You're having too much hit amyway. No need for Bloodmail or Truestrike.
---
that would just create an entirely new type of griefing.  don't want the opposite faction to AOE your zerg?  sprinkle some level 40s in there.  if they attempt to use any kind of aoe, they're punished for it.
---
If there’s one thing I’d help horde with it would be slaughtering progress. Never met such assholes so please do that everytime you can lol
---
Also, onyxia deep breaths more
---
What do the first two lines do? Looks like they define variables that aren’t actually used in the macro.
---
So people would be forced to leave their guilds just because they log on 1-2 hours after them?
---
Because of faction imbalance.
---
Look buddy I'm not gunna let some cheeky fuckn mage out aoe me
---
Since you both seem confused, you can have multiple WoW accounts on one Battle.net account. Essentially, WoW1, WoW2, etc.
---
Properties from one WoW account apply for your other ones as well. If you're playing retail - achievements, mounts, titles, transmog are all mirrored to your other WoW accounts (including mage tower skins for druids)
---
At least in the past, this meant you could delete your main on WoW1. Create a new character on WoW2 with the same name, and then restore your main and it would be flagged for re-name. I'm not sure if this works anymore but its a method I've used in the past during Legion (I have 2 accounts on the same Battle.net)
---
Another method that I used back in WOTLK was to have friends / guildies report my name until it gets flagged for renaming (they would open tickets that it was offensive to their religion, no matter how random the name was) and then you can change your name.
---
Because 75% of the servers have a huge horde imbalance and therefore many more horde will be queuing cross-realm than Alliance.
---
So Alliance will get insta-queue and Horde will be waiting in a big ass line.
---
And I wouldn't have to farm DM West for the panties... Good idea.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Id say on pservers ony was equal to barbed, zg is just barbed with no stam iirc. I never used the zg one cause your top fury really needs stam and armor to be honest haha, i would always meme that those are your best dps stats. 
---
But yeah here with hs, hit loses almost all value except youd go a little higher than soft cap if you lost wbuffs. Which is funny cause your pserver wbuff set was max hit, id run 14-17, and on classic your wbuff set is minhit
---
Warrior mechanics and theorycrafting overall are a bit hard to get into and understand so thats where i assume the downvotes are coming from
---
P.s. Man, I really chose the wrong server to reroll mage, warriors are disgusting here
---
100% agree
---
Icy Veins is garbage.... Do not listen to a word they have to say.
---
Both factions are mostly brainless zugs pubstomping 10v1. 
---
Trust me you have plenty of shitty players on your side too.
---
NEVER
---
&gt;The fact you don't even take amount of players/concurrent online into notification is sad, despite it fits your narrative.
---
That's on what my census is based. Hilariously enough, your source definitely doesn't do that. 
---
&gt;Wowclassicpop, IIRC that's the most widely used census.
---
Which is really faulty as it depends on the player uploads and it doesn't curate for any details (in example, uploads).
---
Talking about sad, you got nothing and ignore what doesn't fit your narrative. Please, count the amount of PVP and PVE servers and post it here. Then try to support the notion that a 52:48 ratio is anywhere possible. Pathetic hypocrite.
---
Don’t even try man. All this sub is comprised of is salty alliance players who thought they wanted a pvp server but actually needed a pve server 🤣
---
no because no changes only works if we have NO FUCKING CHANGES
---
blizzards half assed approach and stealth changes are the problem
---
who would've thought that such a shit system would get exploited any possible way  
---
sure not me!  
---
/s
---
An epic mount in vanilla was something to behold... Now its like, if you dont have one youre a filthy casual and get out of my raid grp.
---
Lmao I love that some players are “toxic” for pvping on a pvp server. Fucking ridiculous logic
---
Yes. I am lvl 60 and still playing. But the two or three times I tried to do ANYTHING in open world (like farming) I got killed and corpse camped instantly (i am horde btw). So as long as you are just dungeon running/raiding it is okay, but leveling is just not worth the pain atm.
---
It's because you're lv28. I too enjoyed low lv pvp while leveling.
---
On some servers, when you're 55+ as the minority faction, every relevant flight point is death upon landing by 10+ players. Then prepare to be camped when you respawn. Then after the 15th time, you give up hope and take res sickness. Then you proceed to die at the graveyard again.
---
Every single flight point. I wish I was exaggerating.
---
Whisper the healer and let the fps who pull die.
---
is it the death that resets the timer? because I've seen people unflag halfway through killing them
---
Good advice for any sort of aoe pulls including CoC kiting. Gotta break that nova when there's like 0.5-1s remaining.
---
AND THANK GOD FOR THAT! If we had to follow the original schedule, we'd be bored out of our minds...
---
It's definitely not impossible. You can see when thorium point has a horde raid camped on it 80% of time, or when blackrock mountain has a horde raid camped at the entrance, jump, molten core entrance, and brd entrance all at once, and when seeing alliance do the same is rare enough that people mention it in guild chat. So far I have not flown to light's hope chapel without there being a horde raid waiting for me. Only twice have I seen an alliance raid there.
---
It isn't balanced. The interesting question is why.
---
Oh we more often than not take em out. Bar the times they are 20 people.  We typically are 5-8 since most of the guild arent that into PVP. 
---
Plan B represent.
---
Also, when Alliance players get ganked at a flight path, it affects them because they have to run for two minutes to resurrect, because the graveyard is IN THE HORDE HUB of the zone (see Feralas, Burning Steppes etc.). It would just be a minor nuisance to Horde players.
---
Real tanks are geared already
---
what you are getting are either fresh rolled people who didn't play wow before (or at least didn't play the older wow) and is unused to this from retail.
---
Or fury warriors throwing on a shield to get into the place quicker and not know what to do.
---
&gt; not the facts
---
A snapshot from launch isn't really relevant. What is relevant is the server pops as Alliance complained they were out numbered 10 to 1 (which the data from that time period did not back up).
---
It isn't. I am basing it on playing this game multiple hours everyday and seeing a massive imbalance on my near 50/50 server combined with the fact that it seems to be the case everywhere.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
BG's reset all CDs in Classic too? Thought that was a BC thing.
---
Wtf bro dont beat up your girlfriend.
---
ugh warrior died 8 times in ZF the other day... I'd be sitting drinking next to our level 60 mage and I got flamed to hell and back when warrior died.
---
I feel like most kids wouls be most drawn to horde. As a kid a tauren drew me a lot more than a night elf.
---
If you find getting gold to be hard as a prot warrior its time to realize you are shit at the game.
---
on my server i build up a costomer base for tank services anyway cuz they know they getting a very geared tank thatll make their run smooth
---
Yea i left early, after first week
---
Oh no, not the level 40 non-elites!
---
Where is your logic?  All I see is the same appeal to authority.
---
Pepehands;( no idea then haha. Maybe just go with some of the other big groups of hordes. They are usually in burning steppes progress
---
LMAO Right
---
Lol, on Yojamba we have resident Horde rogues who are just living in IF. We deal with them pretty well.
---
I never blamed the other faction. I’m not sure how you took it like that. The only thing remotely close to me “blaming the other faction” is me asking “is this an alliance only problem?” At the end.
---
I went disc/holy at 58 - when i was asked to heal a MC pug. Even got loot!
---
Then just levelled 58-60 with lbrs/ubrs
---
Yeah people were abusing the dumb honor system in retail with 6 raid groups (3 per faction) killing each other and giving shitton of honor to everyone. People were doing it for hours and hours the eventual punishments for it were essentially nothing. Doubt anything would happen to these guys.
---
Every time I try and bandage, eat, or anything I get overhealed for 2x my HP. Well except for Ony.
---
This must be boring as fuck. Like what’s fun about a group of 300 farming people rez running into MC ?
---
I could imagine :D but yea i guess you’re right lol
---
Because there are more horde, you will see more griefing. I just tried to lvl yesterday for 5 hours on my shaman. Needless to say, I got wtfucked by alliance whereever i went. When i was corpse camped by a rogue and a druid for 50 minutes (after death nr. 3 i was just standing next to them while dead seeing them hiding behind a tree), I sort of just decided to say fuck it and stop playing.
---
3% droprate.
---
0,03 x 0,03 x 0,03 = 0,000027%.
---
This guy is correct.
---
Level 55 elites vs level 40 non-elites.
---
Yeah. Exactly the same.
---
Whats the difference between open or closed auctions? And whats the benefit?
---
The pace I go when tanking is all about the healer.
---
 I wait for Mana and calculate during pulls how much dmg I can take or how much/fast I can pull.
---
This is why I like going with healers I know or played with before
---
Yeah, Well that's like your opinion man.
---
But it is 2019? lol
---
You spelled "mageblade" wrong...
---
I recommend drain tank leveling if not spellcleaving dungeons.
---
Ms/ruin or ds/ruin for raiding

To spread the "why heff to be so mad" message I guess
---
This. Plus MS is sufficient for all 5mans, regardless of role.
---
nooooooooooooo
---
Mages and warriors have their uses though?
---
Yeah but thats boring.  Wpvp atm is cancerous.  The most fun are the when its like 5v5 or maaaax 10v10.  After that its just whoever has more mages for AOE.  
---
Looking forward to BGs so much.
---
that's german not danish ://
---
just wait until BGs come out  
---
WTF IS THIS BLIZZARD I DIDNT ROLL THE 5:1 MAJORITY FACTION TO SIT IN  1 HOUR WSG QUEUES

the tears will be declicious, stomping them in actual 10v10 fights will be fun
---
Why are people even following Twitch streamers like this piece of shit? I would never, not in a thousand years want to engage in any kind of social interaction with a man-baby with emotional capabilities of a 5 year old.

''meganerds'' okay buddy who hurt you?
---
&gt;Most of them are fully raid geared

Interesting....
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/honorspy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/honorspy)
---
I bet they do all sorts of silly stuff while waiting for a poor bloke to pass by
---
No, but if you que up, HS and then do some wpvp for a while.  Your hearthstone will most likely be off CD when you have completed your first BG.
---
It depends on queue time obviously, and how long the BG lasts (there are no time limits in vanilla). You can get corpsecamped in BG's for 10 hours straight if people don't want to finish their BGs.
---
Oh yeah for sure, there's quite a few misconceptions!
---
If you are doing pvp, then you get the 3% hit talent.   You only need the talent OR the scope to get 9%.   If you have both, then it becomes super easy.
---
Then you didn't read. Citing a source is not the same as saying "he's #1 and you're not"
---
I'm doing dungeons healing as a feral druid occasionally on my alt and I heal the lock more than the tank always lol it blows my mind, are locks just not mana efficient?
---
Also on Herod. I have started leveling on a PvE server. I can't get anything done. If things don't change with BGs I will stay on the PvE server.
---
It is a shame because I love real open world PvP and I don't mind being outnumbered. The problem with the current state of things is that os is near impossible to have a chance to even fight back. Any time I fly somewhere I am jumped by a group of horde players. Then when I rez I am instantly attacked by them.
---
Idk why I typed 'not', fixed. Keep grasping at straws to discredit a sensible census collection.
---
Oh I have no trouble believing that the 10 to 1 is bullshit (well until after the transfers, maybe). And that people are just using FUD to scare their guildmates to transfer rather than stick it out.
---
But the fact is, one of the more famous websites (wowhead is) said that the server you are on is heavily imbalanced, which led to people think about leaving, which lead to people leave when transfers open up, which lead to less people in the world defending each other, which lead to people quitting as they are now being camped like an NPC.
---
If you don't want to see queues for BGs become an impossibility, you should clamor for something to be done. Because all the voluntary stuff that blizzard has tried is doing jack now.
---
Most of this is on Blizzard, but the true origin of it is players min maxing the shit out of everything and the demographic of classic being what it is (IE the more casual folks won't want to play it, even if IMO retail is harder when you talk about top end raiding).
---
It really isn’t
---
I actually started using classicdb.ch for that exact reason. I rarely go back to wowhead as i can get all my Info on classicdb. Maybe try it out!
---
The discrepancies between this and [Ironforge.pro](https://Ironforge.pro) are tremendous in some cases and I'm more inclined to go with logs as a better reflection of ratio at 60 than whatever godawful system this uses.
---
Thalnos 96% Horde? Thunderfury 86% Alliance? Whitemane previously showing up for you as 71% Alliance?
---
These are absolutely broken numbers and if you're basing your opinion off them, you are gonna be gobsmacked when you see your queue times on the 10th.
---
Addon for the name Plate?
---
That's fine, you keep drinking, that's why you have melee :D let tank build threat whilst you drink then blow shit up
---
You cc it
---
I played Vanilla, and I remember getting camped for hours and hours. Wpvp was always a miserable experience during Vanilla. People who say otherwise didn't play Vanilla. That's why I chose a pve server for Classic.
---
I agree what's going on is annoying and not fun at all. But the fact is YOU SIGNED UP FOR THIS. So the people complaining have no one to blame but themselves. So either change to a pve server, or shut up. Because this is what you asked for. And these ridiculous statements that people should be reported for griefing are worth nothing than a chuckle.
---
I swear hunter pets are #1 reason for wipes in dungeons. And alot of the time it's not even the Hunter's fault, it's just messed up AI/pathing.
---
That made me think that blizzard has tons of employees playing as NPCs. Coming home after an exhausting eight hour shift as watcher Jordan.
---
Alliance is much better in classic buddy... paladins,gnomes and dwarves
---
Considering he gets this worked up over some light treason, I can't imagine he's the most grounded individual.
---
As a Rogue - I will gladly tank a small pack or a single mob if it means we get to go that bit faster. Some tanks are just way overcautious.
---
Holy shit their support for Classic is terrible.
---
It wasn't a choice. It was an accident. Your job should be to help people with that.
---
he said subbed afterwards
---
Is this real? Im on Gehennas EU alliance level 40 I can run through raids of 60's and they wont bother killing me most of the time. Probably 4 deaths to pvp at most from 20 to 40 not avoiding any zones.
---
and then you pull aggro and all of a sudden it's crisis mode.
---
&gt; whatever god awful system
---
I see. So because it doesnt back up your narrative, it must be a bad method despite you not knowing what it is? Mkay.
---
Ironforge.pro requires guilds upload their parses. It's very easy to see how incomplete this can be.
---
Meanwhile, Census uses the "godawful" method of seeing who is actually on the server, using who requests. I know, getting an accurate count of race/class/level is just awful, I mean how could you build a population data set by looking at all the logged in players? /s
---
That’s a great way to get rid of that Shadow Weaving debuff, goddamn man
---
I tipped 10g for +30 spell power
---
Why would you play on a server like that?
---
The horde vanishing while you were a ghost is not a bug, nor due to phasing.
---
It is intentional design that has worked that way forever. As a ghost you can only see living creatures when you are within a certain distance from your body. 
---
The intention is to prevent scouting as a ghost.
---
Do you really think there are servers where 96% of the 60s are one faction?  
---
Its demonstrably broken.
---
Will there be Cross Realm Battlegrounds when those go live? A: Cross-realm battlegrounds were a feature of 1.12 and are important for matchmaking, so you’ll be seeing cross-realm battlegrounds in WoW Classic when Battlegrounds are introduced in [Phase 3 of the content roll-out plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049)
---
The rule is in place because it is absurdly easy to portray someone in a negative light by omitting parts of a story or straight up lying. This is not the case since there is no way that rogue is not a nutcase, but it would be incredibly easy to abuse and bring the slandering outside the game too.
---
That really sounds like nepotism lol
---
I usually just forget that you're a lock half the time and heal you anyway, tbh.   
---
Yes I can see from the color of your health bar that you're a lock, but it's just automatic tbh.   
---
Besides, it's so satisfying to see that bar go from 10% to full with one heal because you have so little HP. :D
---
Exactly, so let people transfer. Are you daft?
---
There is no progression....
---
If you want high DPS and good CC then I'd recommend either Elemental mage (Fire/Frost hybrid) or the PvP version of Deepfrost. Venruki and Xaryu should have that talent tree on their twitch profiles.
---
this is the first time my wife has played well, i told her to roll on a pvp server with me (no way i was going to be on PVE). she's been ganked so many times and had many hours wasted to the point of frustration. i explained to her that's part of PVP life so get revenge whenever she see's another ally. now shes gotten soooo bloodthirsty it's hilarious. she will attack people even if she doesn't have the advantage. 
---
tell your missus to harden up..
---
I never had any problems playing on pservers across the EU
---
If the mage would only give us food... The most efficient is to tap to where mana and health are roughly equal then eat/drink. That's what I used to do when solo grinding was viable...
---
Idk why nobody mentioned this, but use viper sting to kill their mana, too. An oom mage is a free kill
---
So because you cant believe it, it's not true? That isn't how data works but ok buddy.
---
Not only did he pass over the BIS BIS BIS fury/tank/threat neck thru the entirety of vanilla, his spec is all fucked up too!
---
Me exactly. First 60 was a mage. More I got a 56 rogue and 55 lock. Rogue is my fave.
---
I'm not OP, but I'm using [this](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes/screenshots) with the described functionality. It doesn't have separate version for classic, but it works fine.
---
Your wand is not a spell
---
Our guild basically does the same thing.   The difference is our DKP system involves subtraction, rather than division.   Why is division better?
---
The quote "You think you want it but you dont" didnt age well. But then somehow aged very well a short time after that.
---
Completely disagree, having a time limit ruins WSG. Finally breaking a 10-man turtle after an hour of trying and failing is one of the best feelings in the world. It is the preposterous honor system that creates all the problems, the actual design of the battlegrounds (*especially* OG WSG) is great.
---
No fucking changes baby
---
What? How is it shitty behaviour to utilize the in-game honor system in the most efficient way possible? Blizzard made the game like this. We knew it would be like this.
---
You retail people really need to start paying attention to things. This is how it was, it's also how it was on private servers, although to less extent because Battlegrounds is more efficient, but there were still plenty of campers at Thorium Point regardless, just farming people flying in.
---
Have you tried not flagging for PvP after porting/flying in from a contested zone? Lmfao.
---
Only private is awarded purely on nubmer of HKs. All others require rank points, which you obtain by making honor. 
---
Every player on your faction who made honor in this week is in the week and you get a standing assigned to oyu based on your earned honor (the person with the msot honor is #1, the 2ndm ost #2 and so on). Depending on oyur standing you get rank points, which will then determine your rank. 
---
It's possible to skip ranks, if you earn enough rank points you could go immediately from rank 0 to rank 4
---
Aye xD
---
We got him yesterday! :)
---
2nd try no less. First try was a bit sloppy, so we had too few DPS left after P2. Second try we ALMOST killed him before P2 even started.  
---
Next time if more DPS survive P1, we should be able to kill him before he submerges.
---
critical mass gets you another 6% on fire spells ... so yes its still +10% on scorch
---
I dont have gloves of spell mastery, bc nobody can fucking craft them and hypnotic flames is better because of way more int/sta.
---
And what the hell is BiS gear? Your "BiS" (fucking hate this bullshit term btw) depends on your specc. I asume you mean those crappy green items of frozen wrath? good look pvp'ing with 2,4k hp and zero mana.
---
You want to know how much 1% crit is worth? Ignite gives you 210% dmg on crits. My Scorch hits for about 400 dmg. You say 1% crit equals 4 spelldmg? Well scorch only gets 42,5% from every 1+ spelldmg, so now my scorch would do 402dmg. Yeah I think im better of with an item that gives me A CHANCE to do more than double that amount. Not every spell can use spellpower efficiently like fireball. And on a spell with a cast time of 1.5s, which you can cast twice during a single 3s fireball, every 1% crit item basically becomes 2% crit. in PvP it matters who can get the enemy hp down to 0 first, not how much dps you can theoretically do. If I get 2 lucky crits in a row and the enemy is dead, it doesnt matter if he still had bubble up or ice barrier or healthpots or if his pockethealer was 0,1s away from finishing the heal. He's dead. Burst is way more important than a bit of spelldmg.
---
And why are you so mad like this? Did some mage with fire burn you or something? Or are you just mad that your pve raid specc will never kill a decent firemage?
---
Debatable. Depends on your other gear. Also, ony neck is bis tank/threat neck thru naxx aswell.
---
I let them die in a way that doesn’t endanger the group. Then they get a big repair bill for being a cock when they won’t listen to me. I usually blame it on lag spikes or I just burn the shit out of my mana til I’m “oom”
---

Except with the crosserver Bgs queue time won't be an issue for either faction. Instant for Allies sub 5min for Horde. Nowhere near enough time to get anywhere other than zones adjacent to squeeze in some wpvp.
---
Small indie faction, please understand.
---
If you take this subreddit’s word as law on the actual state of the game then you will never ever make an informed decision for yourself.

Swear to God, I raided Zul'farrak through this:

Nothing to do with private servers. The gaming community has changed over the past 15 years.
---
Subbing doesn't equal to ban immunity.

No matter how long you subbed.
---
*Fighting Gold playing in the distance*
---
I can’t wait to see what you all bitch about in the next phase!
---
u a snitch
---
for example when 70 people have the same id
---
the first 40 that enter are in, noone else can enter after that and the ones who trie get an error message
---
so the other 30 cant enter while the others are inside
---
Lol you arent very smart
---
I feel like priests are kinda unique in that you can heal all 5 man content as a shadow priest very easily. 
---
My friend was a 55/56 shadow priest and has had no trouble keeping me up in LBRS and both strats. We haven’t tried scholo yet, but I assume it’ll very much be the same (albeit he’s now 57 now).
---
My former ele shaman friend would oom quite often while pulling but has no difficulty healing me now as resto. Gear of course also plays a factor but I’ve noticed this trend with pug healers as well as well as on my own priest.
---
&gt; Why not reroll?
---
I spent ~2 months leveling my character on a PvP server and then pretty much all my friends decided to leave around level 40. All I did after that was get money for my epic mount but with no real chance of raiding, I quit.
---
Now the game's been out for almost 4 months. The idea of coming back, rolling a new character on a PvE realm where some other friends of mine actually raid has lingered in my mind but...investing another 1-2 months to level, get gold (which is harder to do now because layering's gone) for my epic mount, getting gear and just trail behind the content and everybody else just doesn't seem pleasant at all to me. 
---
The leveling was great around release and the month afterwards but it's still time consuming as fuck, just as the rest of the game. I probably could invest that time, but then I'd not do anything else - 15 years ago, I may have done it but now...eh.
---
Ok. As you say, Ironforge requires people upload logs. So you concede these people exist.
---
Your numbers show Thalnos at 96% Horde, 4% Alliance.
---
Ironforge counts 2,391 players from Thalnos, with a 72/28 Horde split.
---
That means 669 of those players are Alliance. If 669 people is 4% of the server 60s alone, then holy shit! Thalnos is a massive fucking server! Except its Medium. So either every single Alliance 60 logs on Thalnos and a freakish amount of Horde don't, your numbers are bullshit.
---
Also I'm looking at it right now:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/fh88Afa](https://imgur.com/a/fh88Afa)
---
In the space of a week, pretty much the entire Alliance vanished, right? You show 4% Alliance in the last 7 days, down from 28% in the last 14. If you believe the entire faction quit in the course of a week, more or less, you're hopeless.
---
 I think its a highly, highly flawed system and using submitted logs as a way to gauge ratios is better because there is no reason to believe one faction is far more inclined to log than the other. Also in the last 7 days it shows Stalagg as 63% Alliance which uh, yeah. Absolutely not.
---
Reason for report:
---
\&gt; I am in the photo and I don't like it.
---
I feel you brother... The thing is its the same on our server... But we are horde.
---
Heartstriker DE ist the most trash server. 75% Alliance are on the server all fleed from venoxis or lucifron to play the game again after being farmed in ironforge. Now there are more Alliance in Og then horde playes on this server. I came from venoxis in hopes to go to a server were its around 50/50 but now i cant trans back i cant change the server in any way exept rerolling but i dont level a secound Character i have a fucking live not like these ppl farming pvp for 20h staight.
---
So when you play Alliance go to heartstriker like all the other German allies that cant hang on full servers populate a new one with there bis chars and kill every single leveling horde Character. I dont even do pvp anymore i just stay there because a 54 mage cant kill bis warrior paladin and rogue.
---
I quit by now. Maybe i look into it again when bgs release but this server is doomed there is so much allis on heartstriker i think you will see no difference.
---
You’re leveling a mate for your bear tank? Isn’t it easier to just find another Druid who’s into him?
---
You’re doing it wrong. Down rank holy light to rank 4 stack spell power and crit.
---
Mate, I also said I didn't realise it would be THIS kind of pvp.
---
I had been on a pvp server before classic - and it was nothing like this. I wouldn't get offended by people expressing their views though, you hordes seem the sensitive type when shown how moronic 20vs.1 looks.
---
Did he say that they let each other get killed turn after turn? So it's not really win trading... Or do you consider BGs as win trading, since 10 ally and 10 horde are meeting in a given place to fight each other?
---
I got a warrior to 60 and never ended up doing anything with it as it was on pve server and wanted to do some pvp so rerolled on a pvp server. I currently made a rogue to level 32 and then got some weird reason to try out mage.. thinking it would be more than spamming some frost bolts. Level 23 atm, does mage become more than just frost bolt? Main thing I'm thinking of is going for some pvp
---
No system is perfect, but one way you get something eventually, while another way you bet with RNG rolls on top of RNG drops and could potentially never get anything.
---
There's 2 types of tanks that chain pull - dumb tanks trained on dungeon finder dungeons and good tanks that have been pushing keys in retail.  The former is dumb and has no expectations.  The latter expects everyone to use use interrupts/personals/stuns/fears/disorients/snares to keep incoming damage manageable and the healer to be DPSing if there isn't any incoming damage.
---
A lot of people do Classic dungeons as if they're m+ now and it works.  That means... yes they are in a hurry, because m+ has trained them to time dungeons as fast as possible.
---
People would rather not ditch all of their progress, gear, gold and time invested for "jUsT gO pVE" argument...
---
paladins don't exist,
---
Moonkins are fun to hang around with, they give motw, faerie fire, 3% spell crit buff,...
---
Threat plates?
---
Getting downvoted for telling it how it is. Remarkable how this sub has become one giant echo chamber. And I thought r/wow had a toxic community lmao
---
I would never post a video of my drunk girlfriend doing anything on the internet, but maybe I'm just too old to get the benefits in doing so
---
Alright. But they didn't lower the cap when they removed layers! My server had more than 4(tested out 4 at the least on my own)layers from the start so there's already 14k minimum players. When removing layers they clearly didn't lower cap as I explained in my last post. There u have it. I'd say it was at least 5 layers which means 17k+ people from start. And then layers removed. And still queue on server son at times the same amount of people are playing as from the start of server. So all of those are playing on the same layer since they didn't lower server cap.
---
I'm used to flying to booty bay -&gt; ratchet -&gt; gadgetzan instead of taking the shorter path. Even on a balanced server, the boat is far too easy to camp.
---
&gt; ou can often hold down tab while facing the direction of the mob and it will target it. Quite useful for targeting mobs further away
---
Hold tab and it will target max range
---
guy told me he won by getting a 51 on the roll, thought I was funny since he already gets a free mount as a pally lol
---
Because we don't force people to do it. Everybody is just FREE to do it. If the mages decide they'd rather just bid on the loot they want at the time they want that's up to them. Us hunters started it and others followed suit and the GM was okay with it from day one. The one person that didn't like it left after a few weeks. Of course it's a way to game the system, that's the whole point, it encourages classes to work together in securing the stuff they want. You can't properly police it either, if you start setting arbitrary rules about minimum bids then people's priorities start changing and it becomes a new game of playing the system to your advantage. 
---
And I never said the guild made that tier piece decision, the hunters did. The guild is not forcing one character into the role, we just know it's a boost for the guild and will decide who's best to do it. Again, it strengthens the team when you give them some agency. Setting rules and restrictions is necessary but too many makes it a chore.
---
I had someone do this! I roleplayed with a /tell too, even though it's not an RP server. It was his first time someone noticed and was stoked that someone saw it. I told him to keep it up, I thought it was hilarious.
---
So what’s the solution? Really, I’m all ears. What’s YOUR solution to fix the imbalance and to make sure players aren’t throwing a tantrum every time they are killed in world pvp?
---
buy mana potions and dark runes
---
I use health pots and nades every instance so it's easier for everyone. Just because you play a healer doesn't mean you don't need to use consumes.
---
Imagine trying to win battlegrounds as hord lmoa
---
Probably cause it’s Skeram and the worst server to compare the others to in terms of wpvp
---
I have set rates for rare enchants and just ask for a "voluntary sum" tip. 99% of players do the honorable thing and will tip on average 1-5g for basic enchants.
---
Murlocs on my server:  Fairbanks.  Are heavily farmed aswell, you can get away by the murlocs up the path from the beach.
---
Hahahaaaaah xD
---
sounds like an internet problem,i've never experienced either of those. but you don't seem the type of personal to think rationally about problems so i suggest suing blizzard for failure to deliver product.
---
STV is a dead zone should have avoided it..also it might be easier to level with dungeons or better yet mob grind find a secluded spot with mobs approximately your level and grind away
---
Don't remember that. They did make rez sickness honorless at some point though.
---
What server are you on? I love tanking but I also don't rush. I take control and tell people if I want any CC or if a certain target needs to die first. Most people will play well if you communicate. I try to move quickly but comfortably. I have had many people tell me I am one of the better tanks they have ran with. Then I get a few that say I suck and I am too slow. Someone will find a reason to complain but most of the time we get through a dungeon with no deaths. Usually the only time people die or we have a wipe is when someone is out of position and body pulls another group or if we get a runner and can't get it locked down but most of the time we handle it no problem because we have a game plan.
---
I’m pretty sure they would help with such stuff on retail servers.
---
So, where is your proof?  Your argument is that crit &gt; hit, right?   Well BoA has nearly 1% crit, 2% hit, and 16 AP.
---
You're making wild assumptions that aren't backed up in any manner through vanilla or pserver experience.
---
A big part is due to impatient DPSers. When you take it slowly they slowly begin to rage, and when it's too fast, the healer might complain. Both scenarios can lead to a wipe (healer out of mana, or DPSers starting to pull). As tank I have to say that most groups are pretty good though.
---
Right.. I know that. I’m saying he banned someone for mentioning that he seemed upset while he was clearly upset. It’s just a nonexistent reason to ban somebody outside of a personal reaction to what they said. The streamer was clearly raging. The subscriber didn’t suggest that the streamer was upset, he was pointing out what every single person in that chat was observing.
---
Never?
---
yep, did this in vanilla all the time
---
I literally said that in my post.
---
But if 3/4 of the servers have a huge horde imbalance and 1/4 of the servers are even...  that still adds up to a huge imbalance overall tilted to Horde.
---
So Horde will have a queue.
---
That's why you should use a priority system with rolls. 
---
BiS &gt; MS &gt; OS
---
Trial ranks have same rolling rights on tier items and require to be Raider rank for things as weapons, necks etc.. Unless no raider rank rolls, they can roll and it prio's over OS rolls from raiders.
---
We use a spreadsheet to determine BiS, and anyone can apply to add their class spec to an item with proof.
---
&gt; Questing and leveling 1-60 (and doing stuff out in the world after that) is a lot of fun as well, but those aren't thing a casual player will ever get to do on a PvP server.
---
I had all of that in Classic before P2 and had it as well during Vanilla.
---
There is no *honor* in the *honor system*
---
You only use the tram if it's the first time you are travelling between SW and IF. Otherwise, fly. Especially if you are flagged.
---
I find this incredibly fascinating - like what is it that makes someone love one faction and dislike the other. It's very much like that for me - I loved horde before the game came out when I was reading up on races and classes on the old-dusty-old ass wow website. 
---
A part of it could be the very well done and thorough design overall, that makes the look and feel of the race(s), cities, starting zones and music blend together in such a beautiful way. 
---
Still to this day I occasionally ask myself "_who the fuck_ would willingly play alliance?" And then I'll hear someone describe how much they love Stormwind the same way that I love Orgrimmar.
---
Long story short: _green / blue / dead / furry dudes with tusks in their faces_ is far superior to the _variously sized children_ that is the alliance. Lok'tar ogar!
---
Nothing will happen.  Blizzard doesn't give a fuck.
---
that aint loot council
---
that's straight up ninja shit
---
no it's because we didn't actually get nochanges
---
I had one guy where I was basically doing my gloves, shoes, chest and   Shield. 30g was apparently worth a "thanks, cheapskate".

Wait what!!!Warns us about nswf damn that guy is mental

We'll have the same post for 2 weeks to farm karma... Daring today are we ?

---
its the best and worst system
---
you need fair ppl as officers for it to ever work
---
It sucks, but at least you can deny them honor.
---
Youre bullshitting us, right. That regen while sitting myth is a holdover from EQ days... Right?
---
wow so much edge.
---
It’s a marginal upgrade for them and an enormous one for warlock/mage. Hammer of Grace is 33 healing so you’re gaining 7 healing and 1 crit while a caster is getting 21-26 dmg and 1 crit.
---
Try it with "Pala pug tanks" - i have to drink after every group, so healer has enough time for it too.
---
Imagine crying about dying in IF to a single rogue who popped thistle tea before dying himself.
---
Came to say this :)
---
You must have been on a shitty server. Played vanilla on PvP from shortly after release, and it was never this bad.
---
They're to use up this bad luck, so next two rolls are higher.
---
Is it as accurate as your "100s of $" (when it was 75 dollars, not hundreds) or do I need to take what you just said with a grain if salt and assume that it's literally not how it went and in the end had a justified ban?
---
I was just about to tell OP that I've never seen a problem.. but then.. I run uBlock.
---
Seriously, many websites are absolutely cancerous without a blocker, and a quick look at how much is blocked would put wowhead firmly in this category.
---
What add on you using for those trendy nameplates? Any config needed?
---
&gt;  kick them and get another.
---
I read that a lot but it takes time to find one, for them to arrive at the dungeon and, worst case, reach the group through respawn.
---
It isn’t tab targeting. You keep your finger on tab until the glow under the mob is on the right one. Try it.
---
There is absolutely a tos...  WTF are you talking about?
---
Are you too stupid to count? There is no bullshit math involved, its literally just adding up.
---
Besides, go to wow head, use the classic gear planner and check it yourself.
---
And tell me which item is not suited for pvp? Literally everything is especially suited for pvp. You just have no clue whatsoever and are just following stupid BiS list other people put on the internet.
---
Don’t worry they won’t. So everyone will go back to que dodging so they can farm pugs for quick honor.
---
The small indie company Blizzard could squeeze a few dollars into better servers
---
Yeah at this point we're DEing a lot of gear. If we got a new guy then all that gear would just go straight to them
---
All the keys,rep, back and forth to fucking azshara. Levelling fishing first aid herbalism engineering. Getting exalted with darnassus.
---
Yeah I agree, no thanks.
---
If a mage doesn't magic detect they can't see the honorless rebuff anyway right?
---
the hit isnt valuable enough for a druid to do that
---
should prio to tanks first, then fury warrior/rogues
---
It may be rude to say this, but the tanks who got out the gates early and knows what to do, aren't really needing to run dungeons anymore, so that's probably why you are encountering less than great tanks somewhat frequently.
---
do u really need class icons next to health bars?
---
Talking with the opposing faction isn't colluding with them in game.
---
Depends on the enchantment. Crusader tips are 15g+ while bracers +9 stam are 2g. Highest tip for an enchantment is +spellpower, which is around 30g usually. 
---
You can tip however you like, these numbers are based around the tips our guild enchanter gets on average - prices may be different on other servers/enchanters
---
wow, logic from a druid about accuria
---
breath of fresh air
---
so many ppl so greedy they will mess up loot prios
---
The back entrance is known as “The Alliance Dire Mail Entrance” on Stalagg.
---
Walk in, use ItemRack to take off gear, die, run into whatever DM instance you wanted to do.
---
Classic runs on Legion client so you don't want a computer older than 2015 if you want good performances in crowded areas
---
Fury wars should not get accuria. prot only
---
For the leveling, finding dungeon groups were easy for me. Because people look for mages for SM cleave groups, ZF cleave groups, BRD aoe exp groups etc. Also these cleave groups make leveling a lot faster... Aoe solo grind spots were busy when i was leveling but i'm sure you can find some empty spots at the moment since most of the people leveled to 60 and focused on the end game content. When it comes to raid gearing, that could be rough. I've been clearing full mc and onyxia for 3 months and I still dont have any MC loot...However, there are a lot of mages with almost full MC gear, so you can get gear if you are lucky but yes, I can say raid gearing will be rough.
---
Well generally you won’t be gaining that much gear, so you’ll have a bit more sway with your priority. Unless you’re a druid in my guild. They can very well have more GP than EP in their first few weeks.
---
New members (or anyone that haven’t gotten loot) will actually have massive priority to start with, since they will have gained EP but only have 1 gp. Example: my guild began using EPGP and I passed on some loot (I’m not worried over it, so I let other snag it). By the time I got my benediction (the 4th or 5th), I had so much EP and only 1 gp that no one could have contested me for it if there was anyone that wanted to try (I was the last main priest).
---
But the decay helps keep everyone fairly even after a while, and dissuade people from saving up like they do in DKP (some DKP systems use decay too, which is what I prefer). Basically a “use or lose (some of) it” situation.
---
That’s ok, you can return the downvotes when we laugh at you crying over your battleground queue times.
---
BAN BAN BAN BAN BAN BAN
---
If you can out-dps the top-20 parses from ele shamans you have rights to talk.
---
If not, shut the fuck up.
---
I play HOTW specc as a Druid so I can both heal and tank.     
---
I LOVE healers that drink as soon as they leave combat, I usually top myself of with hots and pull the next pack, so when the healer needs to heal he got almost full mana again.    
---
So I try to do the same thing when I heal, position myself towards the next group and drink ASAP.    
---
And I usually state by the beginning that I call MB when I need a longer break, otherwise it should be fine for them to chainpull.
---
Gently let them know that tanks should have the aggro since healing them is more efficient. If they keep trying hard to get aggro, let them die... For mana reasons, ofc
---
For who? Rogues/hunters/tanks? Definitely not fury
---
&gt;by whom? either it is, or isn't against the rules.
---
Well blizz doesn't give a fuck anymore, so no one.   If they actually cared about the health of the game, like they used to, they fools would already be banned.  But current day blizzard is complete dogshit, that's just going to take the path of least resistance, and most profit.  So, they're not going to do anything.   
---
This isn't a good excuse for their scummy behavior though.
---
Alliance, and it's all about the zone aesthetics and architecture for me. Human, Dwarf and Night Elf towns and buildings are many of the best looking in the game. There are a few good Horde zones (Mulgore is gorgeous), but their buildings are all... kinda ugly, IMO. Only Forsaken have nice buildings Horde-side and those are just Human buildings that haven't been properly maintained.
---
We just had a lock sitting in brm that would summon anytime you wanted. If it happens the same way thats still 10 to 15 minutes of hk's. With the server populations so gargantuan its enough to make it worth your while easily. Do a wg in 10 to 15 minutes as a premade then summon me to brm and another 10 to 15 of hks then just click the bg acceptance que and its nonstop honor farming. If you think this is not going to happen man have i got bad news for you
---
Shoutout to Gentlemanofc on Shazzrah for repeatedly dying between IF AH and bank trying to gank. Truly dedicated.
---
TLDR.  If it's red, it's dead.
---
This basically. It takes a bit to get everyone on a roughly level PR, but once everyone has gotten a few pieces, their PR will be pretty stable. A new person can spike around a bit comparatively, until they’ve gotten a few weeks of raid and a few items.
---
Yes, my guild decided to transfer earthshaker a couple of days ago.
---
Noticeably less alliance since start of p2.
---
I wanted to add, PvP is not completely absent on PvE servers, it's just disabled by default and you can opt in by clicking on your portrait. Most people's idea of world PvP was not 40-man gank squads, but mostly butting heads over resources and quest mobs, and would like to do that occasionally. Well, on PvE servers most of the PvP happening in exactly that.
---
Laughs in warlock.
---
That guild will be dead at AQ
---
It's legit the pserver meta, seems like you we're stuck playing WoD when pservers was booming.
---
I'm the one making BiS lists, while you are a clown using PASSIVE trinkets in PVP and taking 1% crit ring over 10 int 15 stamina for example.
---
Trinketmenu, Autocarrot is also handy for auto equipping and in equipping carrot and items with mount speed increase.
---
Show me a mage who uses magic detect BEFORE cone of cold. Ill wait
---
Giving it to a DPS gives the raid much more overall benefit. You are only proving why loot council is the best system
---
Must be nice having bag space. 3 sets of gear, FAPs out the ass, healing pots, swiftness pots, invis pots, etc. all keys, bandages and food. Warrior lyfe
---
So fuck your boss' wife. That's a win-win. A free shag and you get to play WoW.
---
&gt;T‘S BECAUSE OF OVERALL SPEED AND NOT BECAUSE OF PROGRESS. 
---
So you kill the boss a little slower. Big fucking deal.
---
&gt;Implying good guild atmosphere and friendship just vanishes when you raid hardcore. Ayyyy
---
If you force ur boomkin and SP friend to switch it definitely might.
---
&gt; They've fired so much of their support team that the responses you get right now after 3 days are just copy and pasted messages. 
---
feels like EU doesn't have customer support or GMs at all anymore
---
people safespotting without repercussions after weeks of many people from my guild reporting them every day
---
I haven't had a single support ticked answered in all of classic, every single ticked I opened was closed without answer
---
do community managers even exist anymore?
---
No. Just idiots in general. I rolled on PvP because I did during vanilla. This isn't the PvP I was expecting. And I'm Horde.
---
Pretty much. Any new person we get who wouldn’t be willing to wait for one of the *many* items that they can use and everyone else has to drop isn’t someone I want to take.
---
Bangladesh CS support right there.
---
so bullshit that blizzard removed the post
---
lmao :D
---
He's in alliance territory. Even on PvP server's you won't be flagged for PvP unless you attack.
---
OP did this to himself as he flagged for PvP.
---
Or buff outside the instance and bring no druid!
---
Mage PvP can be different.
---
&gt;hard life being level 50.
---
Then why attack alliance and flag yourself for PvP.
---
Hunter here. It's the hunters fault.
---
That wasn't the implication. The point was that theres so many third party ways to talk to other people now as opposed to 2004, even if active collusion was going on how the fuck could it possibly be proven? Blizzard would have to ban on extremely tenuous evidence which is bad for business.
---
Lol, if you played pservers you'd know it will significantly change the situation as it stands today.
---
so far everything blizz has done has been good to vanilla players like myself. even wpvp has been great but i do need BGs as well. im guessing youre a salty retail player whos mad cause all your realms are dead?
---
Literally had my Strat UD group fall apart over this last night. We had one or two players who weren't no-lifers and it was impossible for the tank to communicate with anyone.
---
Half way through after a wipe the tank just rage logged off. I typed "guess we won't find a tank for the last half, if you're as done as I am jump up and down". After a couple of minutes everyone started jumping and /lol'ing.
---
Why would I get bored? Because I can’t go out and gank people? Do you have any idea how much there is to do other than that? 
---
For one, there is world PvP on PvP servers, all the time. Plus battlegrounds, plus *every other aspect of the game*. But if all that gets you off is ganking lowbies then you do you mate.
---
Guilty as charged. As soon as I jumped I had this sinking feeling I had forgotten something, and as my pet came charging in, with half the trash following, I quickly remembered.
---
I guess we’re all huntards at heart, lol.
---
its fine
---
horde will have so long queues to BGs that some will reroll alliance
---
Your friend should make up his fucking mind as which spec he wants to play.
---
Works much better in TBC and beyond. When they started figuring out itemization and making off specs more viable.
---
The best thing to do as a prot warrior is just go ahead and level an alt. I promise. Im no longer poor. Im no longer ganked. And when i can teach the tank some secrets you make alot of friends.
---
I’m horde. And holy fuck almost 80% of horde players are doggo zug zug apes. Do they even look at their screens? Zerg zug zug. That’s it. Can’t win a fair fight for their lives. Ragnorian-Kromkrush
---
We had our only ret pala ragequit &amp; delete his toons after finding out he was only second in line to get eye of sulfuras after one of our holy paladins.
---
Yes some items like Onslaught which are bis forever for some specs should probably go to the more useful specs first, and as I ret myself I would have no problem with that, but if you're gonna be like that just dont bring rets at all, either have them spec holy and maybe still allow them to roll dps gear, or let them know in advance so they can find another less petty guild to raid with.
---
Why not just play a pve alt when you need a break?
---
They were a bit different because both faction were always relatively well balaned, and also had their own PvP guilds/teams etc roaming around fucking with everyone.
---
But even then, they were still doing honor farming while quing, so if honor farming on classic right now consists of camping flightpaths etc, I just don't see why that will change.
---
If they want to be most efficient and compete for rank 14, thats the way it goes. And for people who corpsecamp for fun, why would they even do BGs, if they don't care about anyways.
---
I use the addon Questie because it adds markers on the map and minimap. Apparently it's a bit of a controversial topic here as it simplifies questing to the point where you don't have to read any questtexts anymore. That being said, I still recommend it *a lot*. One of the most important features is that it shows the player where questhubs fitting the level range are. Basically it dumbs down the levelling experience, but it provides conveniency and decreases downtime by a huge margin.
---
As for the lore knowledge, yeah, maybe you would be missing out on some of the lore. It's tempting to just click through everything because the addon shows you where to go anyway.
---
Without Questie I'd probably stop levelling altogether though.
---
&gt;Saying nothing is better than saying something dumb af.
---
Maybe it is time for you to unplug your keyboard then.
---
So that stat priority is incorrect?
---
It would suck to be a druid.   You get all that mediocre tier gear, which is mostly for pvp, and then you cant win anything else.
---
1. Step towards ledge
---
2. Eyes of the beast
---
3. Jump down as the pet
---
4. Make pet stay
---
5. Profit
---
They negated his “drop out of stealth and kill them before they can touch me” because he thought the alli in a peace pact with the horde were going to help him when he popped to stun lock and yank before vanishing and hiding in a corner till all his cds came back, as rogues do. So of course he is mad. Is probably the type to blame stream snipers or spyclassic when someone gets the upper hand on him.
---
What do the guards do?
---
Are they straight up running into each other as 40 man? That sounds dumb af, that's only slightly more honor than killing someone 1v1 4 times.
---
I figured they'd set it up somehow so they all get solo kills on each other until everyone hits DR.
---
I dont know what you want to tell us with this post ? 
---
When a hunter doenst have any Ammo hes going in for close range fights .. the most basic game mechanic of you class. Wow. Thanks for sharing. Now take a cookie and come back with some interesting content pls.
---
Windfury so I can play two hand warrior, every time on vanilla, last 5 years
---
This is wow in general lol
---
Easy to fix. Got an honorable kill in the last/next minute after killing a lowlevel? No penalty.
---
Nice
---
My point is that talking isn't an issue.  We could talk to the opposite faction in 2004 without too much trouble.
---
Hunter here, I second that.
---
You're not even pretending to argue in good faith.
---
There was not this kind of outcry during phase 1 when, believe it or not, PvP was happening on PvP servers! That's not the issue.
---
Not for warriors
---
I'm the only person who's said that that I've seen, if theres more then so be it. I was never #nochanges guy. They should have done basic qol shit across the board. I was told Classic was fine for casuals "because it was made for casuals to begin with" which is just unreal to me. I'm aware Everquest and Ultima were "more hardcore" than WoW but that's like saying putting your dick in a grinder is more hardcore than merely smashing it with a brick. I just dont have the time for the OG game, plus this bullshit, all to play a spec and class that I want to play but will never be accepted in a raid environment anyway. I'm glad classic exists and people are having fun with it, it's just not for me. I tried retail on a whim for the first time in years and was pleasantly surprised by the experience.
---
Healer or tank should be the only ones slowing down a run.
---
The tip being: Log out and back in before ressing. Makes you honoreless so whey they kill you again they get no honor.
---
drama is the best part of classic tbh.
---
And all these toxic influencers deserves to be corpse camped every day.
---
no, we will gank you while we wait our 30min queue ;)
---
It's mors of a pve skill. In raids you stack alot of AP, whereas MS just scales off your weapon
---
In terms of rings basically all the different phase prebis are scuffed and wrong for hunters. The rings you need depend entirely on your hit and that's different for everyone based on their gear. T1 gives 3% hit, T2 gives 2% hit - how you make it up to 9 is a whole different story and varies a lot based on what you can get.
---
Unless they set it up so people can get solo kills, what's even the point? Otherwise you're just wasting your DR on 100+ people getting like 10 honor from each.
---
I thought about that, if it's communicating via chat I could just send false data in a way, couldn't I?
---
Or bows
---
Overal there is a horde dominance
---
So respec and solve your problems then instead of complain
---
This post is tongue in cheek as well. There was no drama, everyone is happy with the DKP system in our guild, and I don't do half the DPS of casters either.  
---
But looking at the amount of comments this is a really opinionated subject for a lot of WoW-players.
---
They aren’t breaking ToS tho... they just simply aren’t killing each other. If they were “farming honor with each other” they would simply go to an unpopulated area with a relatively close GY and simply trade kills.
---
Noob here, I wish I could hover over things to see what these things (besides the poisons) actually do
---
Yeah, they're butchering the goose that could have laid them a lot of golden eggs.
---
Watch blizzard ban people for doing this for exploits
---
That got changed on Nov 29.  [https://github.com/kakysha/HonorSpy/commit/78121b014b81ac07dccdd5f036c89d11a955b7dd#diff-74f93dae9d40b1db35eb35db5a1b516e](https://github.com/kakysha/HonorSpy/commit/78121b014b81ac07dccdd5f036c89d11a955b7dd#diff-74f93dae9d40b1db35eb35db5a1b516e)
---
Getting raid loot depends a lot on the guild loot system. If you haven't gotten a single piece in ~12 raids, sorry friendo, but you probably got shafted :( Good luck in the future!
---
At least his name isn't Weiner guy
---
Now look again at the image pls
---
You know a hunter knows his class properly when he uses Eyes of the Beast to jump his pet down first.
---
Uh, what? Wetlands is Contested Territory...
---
chill
---
Wetlands is contested, you fucking doofus.
---
&gt; There are multiple PVP servers that are heavily Ally dominated.
---
uhhh, west and eu most are all horde by a substantial margin
---
This tactic worked the first 2-3 days after honor system was released. Now the horde as caught on. There are no more safe routes.
---
For me the difference always wasn't the time invested but the result. Any guild closing to even worldtop500 not even mentioning 100 usually embraced that sweet 6/7 or 7/7 RT but only hardcore guilds were in worldtop10. I played worldtop50 and I consider my guilds semi-hardcore simply because we weren't good enough to reach 10.
---
You mean streamers that ended up aoe grinding dungeons in raid groups to level up?
---
Does the twitch app auto update addons too?
---
&gt;Yea you're right
---
Dang right I am. Next time, be a bit humble &amp; do your research to avoid embarrassing yourself lil fella /slap 😉
---
The ToS bascially just says "Dont do shitv we dont approve of" 
---
Nowhere is there a clear guide on what will and wont get you banned.
---
I dont want to burst your bubble, but you can have a DKP system without giving items out like that. We use a priority system and it works fine.
---
You know the BGs are going to be cross-realm, right?
---
Also there is a sad fact: the more people sit in queues, the more they are keen on going out to gank.
---
Dunno what you're talking bout, in my groups tanks mostly are cool
---
I'm on a us server from the uk, I sit on a steady 120ms! I feel like sometimes I'm getting more over healing than I would be if I had 20ms... but it's probably just me being slow.
---
This is next level clever. If enough people do this then the no-life BRM campers will find some other way to gain honor because it won't be the most optimal way to get it. Power in numbers people!
---
\&gt;Don't give up!
---
&gt;PVE servers you guys recommend that are hopefully faction balanced?
---
Why would you care about faction balance on a PvE server?
---
Let's look at simple maths, ok?
---
Current situation (no BGs): 100% of time, Horde are in open world seeking kills.
---
Future situation (BGs): x% of the time, Horde are in BGs, or are traveling from Battlemaster to open world. Therefore, **(100-x)**% of the time, they are in the open world.
---
(100-x)&lt;100, therefore it will make a difference.
---
dont care enjoy the queues LMAO
---
5v1 the most skillful outplay I have ever seen in my life.
---
Is anyone doing anything else than SM/Ruin or oh so boring DS/Ruin? 
---
I feel like most people just read 'spec this for max pewpew dps with these BiS' and follow that just brainlessly.
---
Lol imagine wasting your life doing something you enjoy without reward. Single much?
---
Yep. Don't get me wrong, The trinket is good defensive trinket *currently* but it's replaced several times over by the time you get to Naxx. Most notably by Styleens+Lifegiving gem that you'll be using most of the time from BWL onwards.
---
Two questions regarding to battlegrounds:
---
- How will the system balance out the teams? Will there be set amount of classes allowed for both teams (e.g. X amount of healers, Y amount of DPS classes, Z amount of tanks etc)? 
---
- Do the system take into account the player's spec? For example, do the system form the team 'randomly' regardless of what they specialise at (e.g. either shadow or healer priest, either resto or dps shaman etc)?
---
the alliance are xenophobic imperialist capitalists, the horde's primary color is red for a reason. the alliance's first two dungeons are literally strike-busting (the defias brotherhood was right, rip comrade vancleef). the horde's are rooting out imperialist sympathizers (the burning blade) and fighting climate change (a la the emerald nightmare). lok'tar ogar, comrade.
---
Finding good dps that will make the run go at a good pace is definitely not easy. You don't know the importance of dps until you're stuck in a regular dungeon for close to 2 hours because shit dies slow af.
---
could just work out a way to make them into paladins lmao, but who wants to be a shit-tier class in the game that cant do anything outside of PVE raid heal because jeff kaplan, i mean tigole bitties, is a gamer-word tirade mongo?
---
Level 55* elites* Nice try.
---
I can only speak for my server, but the boots are actually deceptively cheap to make, maybe slightly less than the pants.  The main issue comes from the fact that barely anyone is dragonscale LW.  Sure, they require honored thorium rep, but that cost me just about 15g in total to go from neutral to honored.  As a reward, I can sell boots that cost 75g in mats for 150g.
---
I did, nice and easy ranking over here :&gt;
---
It competes there with Kingsblood, which is cheaper on my server.
---
Priest is only getting logged for raids atm. Leveling my rogue which is 44. Bit bored atm. I have a lvl 7 hunter which I'm twinkling at 39.
---
these posts are either sarcasm or you are just mentally unstable "LMAO"
---
I think Blizzard will merge them at some point.
---
Maybe they will actually do it in a form of opening a free transfer from this server to others with a lot of warnings they encourage people to do it since their server is dead: just for the sake for people not to feel as forced to change a character name.
---
does rank mean anything in pvp at all about the quality of pvp? camping flightmaster does not really qualify you as good pvp player in my opinion
---
But it is combined with +int. So a majority of gnomes are casters AFAIK, which makes snare the one CC they don't need to escape. Even if they do, entangling roots has no CD, right? So that can just be cast again. Making FN pretty much the only usage, and while I agree that it works great in that moment I wouldn't say it's a great racial when it's pretty much only effective against one class at one specific time.
---
Stat values.
---
Hey man thanks for the reply, do you know where i can find a guide on how to do this? level 32 now and got a few hordes on my spy list that need killing
---
Deep breaths lil bud ♥
---
We have an NA player in our guild on Firemaw EU and it seems to suit him very well. He plays on similar hours as you do too.
---
I feel like besides honor this is why people gank. for those swwet sweet tears
---
They will kill you regardless, now you are dead longer.
---
From PvP-only perspective:
---
100 stamina gives you 1000 hp, which is \~30% survivability (\~40% with soul link).
---
100 spellpower gives you \~20% more damage. 
---
1% crit is approximately same as 14 spellpower, with ruin 21 spellpower (correct me if I'm wrong here).
---
As a pvp player, I never really care about hit but for PvE, that is definitely priority no. 1.
---
Are you bringing them coffee with your undeniable flawless logic?
---
I used to play hardcore. It was tough to take time off work and to keep several alts lvled for class stacking. But it felt rewarding killing shit before others.
---
Stop demanding changes from Blizzard. Not gonna happen.
---
This game is meant to recreate the experience from 15 years ago.
---
All the bugs and quirks from back then are included and even recreated if needed.
---
Nothing will be fixed unless it was fixed in patch 1.12. 
---
If it was bugged back then it will be bugged now and will stay bugged.
---
We wanted classic to be exactly like it was back in vanilla then stop demanding changes to it now.
---
well, yeah, issue is now a lot of hybrids shouldnt be getting items for their role because they cant do that role
---
i.e. a ret should never take onslaught, because the mogoloid jeff kaplan was too busy w/ his gamer-word laden tirades and hate of alliance/paladins to actually make them viable in vanilla like how enhance/ele were semi-viable
---
The main appeal is self identification. You get the opportunity to be just a regular human who fights monsters, instead of being a monster who fights monsters.
---
You can't ban an addon. It uses tools provided by blizzard. All they can do is further limit those tools.
---
&gt; free faction exchange.
---
This can't be done. There's way too much that is entangled with the faction choice, from quest rewards to faction rep.
---
Yeah, we require flasks primarily so we can clear trash faster and save time.
---
I was a PVE player ever since Vanilla but rolled PVP for Classic. Partly because I wanted the experience of it, partly because it always aggravated me when enemy players would just follow you and hound you with emotes and you couldn't do anything about it because they stayed Green.
---
Which, funny enough, happens much less on a PVP server (so far). But the trade off is that you have things like what I saw today, where three Horde were camping the Alliance flight point at Gadgetzan, far enough away from guards to avoid aggroing them, and basically sniping anyone who landed and preventing people from being able to fly out.
---
Which just tells me, bored assholes who want to overcompensate for being bullied as children are going to find ways to be fucksticks no matter what server type you play on.
---
Duels duels duels. That will help a lot. We used to spend days in front of OG while dueling.
---
It would still matter for the amout of players to group with...
---
I knew it! The mages of the world (of Warcraft) have united to scam their respective factions for portals. Unfortunately it’s only alliance mages making the cash
---
Either way it’s an upgrade for the guild. Don’t see why it’s such a big deal that a healer gets an upgrade. Especially the spell crit on a Paladin being hyper valuable
---

---
1% crit, 2% hit, 16 AP 15 agi v/s 2% hit, 16 agi, 16 ap and 1% crit
---
15 agi v/s 16 agi
---
Yah, you really need that 1 agility upgrade!!!
---
&gt;Future situation (BGs): x% of the time, Horde are in BGs, or are traveling from Battlemaster to open world.
---
But they just hearthstone, so travel really isn't a big factor.
---
Battlegrounds also probably won't be insta-queue after the initial hype, and the BGs also have no time-limit so there will only be a limited amount of them up at any time. And then not everyone is going to do BGs, a lot of people just want to do their PvE content and just slay anyone on their way to BRM, or around whatever objective they are focusing on.
---
&gt;(100-x)&lt;100, therefore it will make a difference.
---
Yes, but I severly doubt it will make as big of a difference that people seem to assume.
---
There are no pvp servers where this isn’t the case
---
You should always have 2-3 siphons running at any given time and nearly always be casting. You grab 1 mob dot it then send it away for 10s. Grab another. By the time they come back they are probably dead. With luck they'll bring a friend with them tho, so you can dot them as well. Sometimes you can get away with killing 8-10 mobs without moving. If needed you can always just pop a bandage after you, loot and skin while your succubus is chasing after the mobs to finish them off...
---
If they aren't killing people from up there while the guards can't attack then it's not safe spotting if they use the spot for summoning, recovering and buffing that's fine.
---
That's completely fine, people rolling horde with an idea to play BGs should have seen it coming and be ready anyway.
---
I will laugh hard at any complainer about queues I see.
---
hahaha lost it at slender human
---
&gt; The fact that you can find groups so easily made me prefer warrior leveling
---
This is the only advantage they indeed have. But there are other classes who have the same advantage. As a warrior, I'd take a mage over every other DPS, for example, due to how much easier dungeons get when you have sheep.
---
Right, but the Paladin uses crit better than any class in the game bar none. Plus there’s other faster drops that aren’t as good for a Paladin like Staff of Dominance.
---
because many mages suck
---
About Onyxia fight, is there a full reset of the threat list on the start of the phase 3? Is there any reliable way to get aggro from her?
---
It's a little more detailed than that, but in general, they're written intentionally vague, so they can ban you for w/e.
---
Losing Aggro is rarely the tanks fault.
---
glad to hear im not the only one doing the same 😂
---
There is one female orc rogue living in IF doing the same on Patchwerk EU. Kinda funny though.
---
Still wouldn’t work for this though. It IS their BIS just people get salty when they feel they use an item better.
---
Ask the guild if you can be their Winter's Chill mage.
---
&gt; when I get the vibe from this subreddit that things have cooled down
---
I wish I had the patience to wait until 2059.
---
Thats just the population for your faction, doesn't matter what it is realtively to the horde.
---
So if the factionw as 100% alliance it wouldn't really make much of a difference since people aren't costing anything but tags anyways.
---
That is a horrible horrible idea
---
I encountered 2 mages on my server. But they were dedicated FP honor hunters. They knew their shit.
---
Farm ZF - 50G per hour... its probablly the best way to farm gold as a mage, as far as i know off.
---
Or... you could do it with arcane missiles, which has 0 variancy, and save on the testing.
---
The point was 'popular' youtubers were saying otherwise.... so quit being a dick.
---
ARMs is T H E pvp spec.
---
I suggest that your guild changes shedule for now. We have raid days on Wednesday, Sunday and Monday and currently were doing MC on monday + wednesday, then wait 1.5 weeks to do the same Thing again.
---
With that People have 1.5 weeks to run around in different specs (pvp mostly) while we dont miss any raids.
---
Onyxia isnt a Problem, dont care about pvp spec there.
---
but they get nothing from it, i wasted their time like they wasted mine. Seems good.
---
They were too busy chasing me
---
I know, I'm not talking about BWL, I'm talking about AQ/Naxx. Maybe a few months was an exaggeration. Still doesn't excuse giving Onslaught to a ret pala when it will last through Naxx for a warrior if you get unlucky with Girdle of the Mentor.
---
smart rogues have been doing this since day1 tho while other people were griefing their own honor gains because they were in big groups/raid.
---
I bought a random boe green with 13agi as placeholder. 
---
Got baron cape 2 hours later.
---
You're alliance so they don't have perception. As someone who often pvps in DM entrance, I have a hard time finding even level 52 stealth classes.
---
Not landing thorium point is smart, but 95% of your success is being a ne druid. Your run back is faster, you have stealth and travel form. You are literally the best possible combination for death running into brm.
---
&gt; grow a spine and start doing PvP on PvP servers. 
---
Ah finally, the players are embracing the PVPservers now... lets hope the cry post will decrease on here as well.
---
No shadow reflector? Or restorative pots for that matter.
---
imagining what hes saying coming straight out of the gnome is sooo fucking funny omg
---
In his defence, i could imagine, he was gearing tank with fire resistance for some MC bosses, if noone wants a ring in raid (it not best anyway), he can have it for extra fire res
---
I knew it :D You just described how I play 100% accurately
---
There's a few of us healers that are near bis that may spoil dps by never drinking. Except warlocks.... I hate warlocks.
---
Buffcap is 32 buffs. *some* leg/shoulder enchants *supposedly* counts in this. Setbonuses does not though *anymore* after the hotfix. You can counter the buffcap by using the weak aura linked. I have been using it myself but stopped using it because the most recent version seems buggy. Your best bet is simply to have buff disciplin. Dont use "too many" consumables when you got dmt/ony buffs. Remember that flurry, enrage, deathwish, recklessness, 2x crusader procs, druid hots, priest hots, priest shields etc all counts as buffs so you might wanna keep your buffs at about 15-20 to have additional room for all these temporary buffs that might push off your important ones.
---
Most don't do it anyway considering how I'm often nuked to death the instant I land at a fp. This is less about whether they can see it or not and more.about denying the assholes camping BRM 24/7 any reward for their behaviour.
---
who and who ?  
---
Dont care !
---
...right. Because other stats are more valuable.
---
In order to reliably be able to tank as a bear you need 5/5 feral instinct. The rest is just optimization.  For gear go stam&gt;str&gt;agi. No reason to buy new gear just pick up what you can on the way. I would tank SM if I were you learning because it's easy enough to have room for errors but not so face roll that what you do actually matters.  Skarm is a youtuber who has a lot of good tank info. 
---
Main is a 60 Fury/prot MT.
---
43 bear alt working his way on up.
---
Message me if you would like and I'll answer any questions I can.
---
Don't forget to have fun
---
no
---
They don't deserve shit. They are bad at PVP.
---
Being able to bring less people to have to split loot less is probably the only good arguement for making raids artificially harder (&amp; way more expensive) by doing split runs.
---
But you can achieve the same by bringing people to the raid that dont need any gear from there (might be hard to motivate players to do that unless you have some sort of dkp or epgp system), or by bringing as many different classes and specs as possible which all need some different gear. Of course loot distribution is gonna be more problematic if you fill a raid with 6 healers and 15 warriors/rogues.
---
Do you have to log out every time you die or just once after being killed?
---
Classic is timeless. Just like StarCraft Broodwar. There will always be people searching for an adventure
---
Hahaha this is me
---
Why would you care? Its all about having fun
---
Make guards actually useful and put more of them around, if you're being ganked in a city controlled by your faction with the enemy player just able to sit there, then that's a glaring issue
---
yeah mana reg works as normal during combat when you're not casting but lifereg is disabled
---
You can easily do dm e lasher runs in arcane spec. With herb your getting 60g/hour
---
We're clearing MC and Onyxia in two hours. Because of min-maxxing. Why should anything change there...
---
Dude, Im quite unhappy about the state of the game right now. Its not fun even from the horde side. Im telling you this to make your life more bearable.  
---
The solution is to release BGs right now on this spot. But I can't really make that happen can I?
---
And then they go ahead and one-shot anyone in PVP with that godforsaken trinket...
---
Fyi elvui puts little bars above your health bar that tick down indicating their remaining time, are color coordinated, and can be clicked to dismiss the totems.  100% would recommend.
---
Why is it BS? He wasn't wrong, it was a simple lack of mechanical execution for not following along with our strategy and they didn't say anything pre-pull about not knowing how we were going to do it. In our raid if you're unsure of the strategy we are using during a pull it's not fair to everyone else if you don't say anything and let the pull happen. Either we're on the same page or we waste time and it's not right to waste time for the other people in the raid waiting for resses and rebuff just because you're careless or not communicating with the raid. The guy is only 1 piece away from his BiS list now, by the way. It's not like we held anything against him, our RL was just not down to have people fail to execute and not be held accountable. Raiding in MC is disgustingly easy but if you let people mess up and don't hold them accountable, future raids will not be as forgiving and problematic. You have to set the tone early, and I don't see anything wrong with how it was handled. There was no name calling, no anger or raising of voices, just accountability and moving on for next time. How does your raid handle mistakes?
---
it's not even about lvl, non elite npcs and vendors
---
Your predication is based on nothing basically.  
---
Lets see how it turns out shall we, before we are making BS assumptions... ?
---
I'm currently in the process of leveling my mage alt (level 43 atm) so I can't speak for the end-game yet, however I can say something about leveling.
---
Getting a group as a mage is super easy for me. I think most people (myself included) prefer a mage over basically any other class because they bring so much to the table: Superior CC, aoe, water/food, excellent damage, buffs. I know for leveling people tend to take whatever person who whisper them first, but I'm pretty confident that if they have the choice between a mage and anything else they will go with the mage. I get quite many whispers asking if I want to join X dungeon in general.
---
I'm playing on Stonespine which isn't one of the biggest server, however the mage aoe leveling spots are almost always occupied by other mages. Some times I'll be lucky to have a spot for myself, but it usually only lasts for 5-10 minutes until someone else shows up. However, these exact aoe leveling spots have so far provided me with the most fun I've had in WoW in a very very long time. Open world mage pvp is ridiculously fun. My server is horde dominated as so many other servers are (I have no clue about the ratio  - I don't think it's as bad as many other servers though), and after have been stomped, zerged, slaughtered and camped on my main, my perspective for pvp has changed. On my alt I jump on any horde player I see (except gray players) and I'm having a blast. 
---
From the perspective of my warrior main though, you should probably expect a harder time getting into raids and get gear simply because there are so many mages all over the place.
---
I would think there will be alot less camping certain zones. But brm is not the end all be all. Its just the easiest location as everyone has gear from all the instances and raid in that one spot. I imagine you will see way less raids and more parties. An alternative to camping brm was ungoro for devilsaur(irrelevant now as leather is damn neardirtcheap) or the bulwark as a cloakable class if you were alliance. Camping boats/zeps should deteriorate as its more about the pressure of griefing the faction. Lower zones should also see less performance. A place like dire maul will always have red its dead mentality. 
---
Personally im on a pvp server and i expect this stuff to happen its just frustrating seeing no one on my faction trying to counter. As raid leader its easy to grp up and run as a team. Raiders Do Not wanna lose their buffs and look weak/a noob. Also they hate wasting time. In a group or raid of 10 its rather difficult to get everyone running as a grp no matter how many times you say "hey, its 10 minutes to run in as a grp vs 1 hour to corpse run solo."
---
To have normal BG queues.
---
Make it 40v1
---
Hmm, might go for this.
---
Hmm, is your pet set to passive? I can't think of any other reasons for it to not work for my Hunter but have it work for yourself.
---
Stat weights vary with gear.  I am not even sure how this list is possible from a dps perspective, unless he already assumes hit cap.
---
If you have 0% hit, then hit will be worth X atk power.   If you have 5% hit, then 1% hit will be worth Y atk power.   If you have 9% hit, then it will be worth Z atk power.  
---
X is not equal to Y or Z.
---
Honorless is expected at a FP though, I bet no one puts DM on people that just ressed though :)
---
Just hit level 49, I've found that the towns are more dangerous than out questing, you're just handing your quests in and bam double rogue backstab gank and then a vanish.
---
pfff you seems salty and had some bad experiences.  
---
To bad you are alliance and i cant show you how it should be done.... meh , your loss.
---
Are you me?
---
BWL portal inside UBRS is to the left when you talk up the stairs/corridor towards Beast room.
---
We're planning to gear everyone out and start earning gold with GDKP runs when BGs come out. We'll make the elixir money back and then some; I'm not worried about that.
---
because of the 69 ? LOL grow up xD
---
It’s we. 
---
All mages are we.
---
Yes my pet is on passive 100% of the time, that could be a reason I think, I'm not sure though
---
My first was ankh of life at I think around level 40ish. It was just a random world drop.
---
sure, like jack each other off admiring how good they are at PVP.
---
Also the Alliance "town" in STV is stupidly weak and defenseless
---
Or you can honorably duel with enemy faction, just like you duel with yours allies. Because wPvP is another name for 60s in T1 ganking lvl 48-60 in greens. Real PvP starts on BGs when you go there with/vs premades.
---
Lmao, because having an almost unbreakable 15s fear isn't good enough already.
---
Nevar!^^
---
its there for a reason, and it shouldn't be changed
---
Complain enough so Blizzard gets off their asses and does something. This is their Problem and they need to provide a solution.
---
Thanks for proving my point about the strawman by building another one.
---
&gt;Which is factually false
---
Except that's factually correct, but you just handwave all proof provided: whatever floats your boat man. Should suck to be as dense as you though.
---
You're not fooling anyone. You were crying like the rest of us.
---
try the website...  
---
There is an guide how to set it up, and also an page what do do, if its not working
---
&gt; Using a shaman tank is irresponsible and essentially fucks 39 people because you want to try something new. I am trying something new, I'm healing instead of reliving my glory days as dps. You don't need to attempt to reinvent the wheel to do something new.
---
I thoroughly re-read the link I sent you and nowhere does it say you'll detriment 39 other players and make their lives a living nightmare. In fact, it showcases that the gap between a warrior and shaman is smaller than imagined. Your comment rubbed me the wrong way because I was in multiple raids where shamans were tanks and I barely noticed/forgot a shaman was tanking most of the time. To think someone might be deterred from playing a shaman because they've been told shaman tanks are not possible or "beyond imagination" saddens me.
---
You’re probably right with this one .... but a few expansions ago I had such a problem and if I remember correctly they helped me (:
---
You mean players vs player, right?
---
But its cross-realm anyways, if it was server wide only (whcih was the case for the vast majority of vanilla) I would agree that faction balance would be more important on pvE servers.
---
storfan from nost?
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4wvhf/what_server_has_a_decent_alliance_to_horde_ratio/). 
---
Also get the feeling the queues are not going to favour the alliance as much as people think. Last I checked the global population was split right down the middle - will be interesting to see how it plays out with xrealm BGs
---
Why? I almost never pug because you never know what you're going to get with a pug. I only will do a dungeon with guildies or people with guild tags that I know and respect. Whoever implemented would have to design so it's not abusable by bullies and salty players but it would definitely encourage me to be more social in game
---
I have a friend who hates getting no honor, I can imagine others feeling the same.
---
if that's the name for no desire to waste my time then yea sums it up
---
Meh know it's annoying but some healers are so damn slow. Tanks do what the fuck they want like it seems. I just drink the second I'm out of combat. Drink til they are 30 percent HP then just heal them up.
---
&gt; Its not fun even from the horde side
---
Try telling that to the hundreds if not thousands of horde players that sit in front of flight paths or in neutral cities and do nothing but gank all day.
---
You don't even get much honor atm to climb during this phase. I would help your friend get to 60 and then farm honor together. Don't have to help him all of the time but just some elite quests and some dungeons. BG is coming so farm honor then.
---
The only thing boss mods do is allow you to not have to remember exact timings of things without having to actually count yourself/with the stopwatch. Bosses do emotes and such to say what is happening, and it's very possible to do fights enough to know what's coming accurately without them. None of that matters with classics lack of boss abilities really though.
---
I actually ask healer what's his comfortable mana percentage for me to pull then watch it.
---
Chill out, drink some soup.
---
tbh its crossfaction colaboration if we take it literal so it is a banebal offence.
---
Horde players be like: **tHeRe Is nO fAcTsHun iMbAleNcE! gIt GuD aNd mAkE uR 0wN pVp rAiD oF 400 aLLiEnce T00 3sCoRt U tO bRd.**
---
90 % of all pvp servers are horde dominated. There's like 1 rppvp server in each region that's alliance dominated. And bruh, basically everyone is playing horde. Just like in retail.
---
Go watch the video and see how pissed the streamer gets when a sub mentions he seems upset. You’re reading far too much into it. If you think the point of my post was about him spending $5, $75, or $100s and didn’t think about what I was actually saying than I can’t do anything but /whoosh.
---
Not even, I said it before launch. I said it years ago when retail was having server issues too.
---
Obviously. A one-size-fits-all list like this isn't possible without simplifying something. It gets you close enough to make the decision for yourself.
---
I don't need to rely on this list to know that hit is a bad stat for Druids. It's common sense if you know how the game works. It's good for Warriors because their specials have cooldowns and they lose 100% of the rage cost every time they miss, but Druids don't have either of those problems.
---
I don't trust you.
---
Look at what ranks you accomplished in the first 3 weeks now. If your are rank 5-6, reducing oyur commitment a couple of hours a week won't reduce your climbing speed by that much.
---
Also remember what oyur target rank is. You can still reach rank 8-10 without having to spend every free minute playing wow pvp.
---
I doubt there’s anything that anybody can do about his issues
---
It's better for locks than mages actually. Warlocks cannot replace it until like naxx. So we prio it to warlocks over mages just because they will use it longer.
---
what people actually wanted as wpvp is some random casual 1v1 1v2 encounters in the world/farming spots where u actually get to play your character
---
what we got in classic is a raid vs raid aoe shitfest with a lot of lag (at first it's fun but gets super boring really fast)
---
I was not aware they were clickable.  
---
That's handy!
---
Not sure I will use it much though, as I've committed my dismiss modifier to muscle memory at this point.
---
Starter armor? This is FINISHER ARMOR
---
LOL made me laugh:D
---
Not only that, a lot of people know the game from inside out now. Back then a lot of them were just kids playing WoW after school with no clue how everything works. Now every single thing has been done, every zone explored, every mob and their spawn location known etc. Classic wow was bound to be different compared to back then.
---
Fair enough
---
They don't get it. They just don't get it. They haven't stopped to count the amount of PVE servers there are and how little the amount is compared to the PVP servers.
---
I stopped readinf after lvl 29 twink bracket
---
Horde be like "LOL u can't 1v300? Git gud zug zug l2p n00b"
---
Half the reason I like playing a Druid tank is I can innervate the healer to go faster.
---
&gt; The only time i fall ofd the meters is if i switch to healing mid fight
---
That only show that your other DPS are not very good :)  
---
I was in the Onyxia raid, where most damage was done by the rogue.  
---
It doesn't show that rogues are good on Ony, only that we had really shitty mages/locks/hunters that night.
---
Mindflay/Arcane Missiles/Drainlife - Soul don't act the same as most other spells. Just like how Frostbolt has a higher resist chance because it is a binary spell - it can't partial resist.
---
Yea just play with people you like, that's the most important thing :D
---
Definitely easier to do on a PvE server.
---
Oof that rough
---
Yeah, I just tried to be informative:p
---
Naw, zug zugging disrupted?
---
Band of Accuria + Quick Strike Ring = 2% Hit + 16 Agi + 30 AP + 1% Crit. I'm not sure why you mentioned the inferior Painweaver Band.
---
But that's just how it goes with loot. A lot of stuff is only BiS for one tier of content. It might be BiS for others for longer and they should probably have priority, but the whole discussion was if it was BiS for Hunters in the first place. And yes, it currently is.
---
&gt;There’s a sense of needing to check my surroundings and be aware of my health and mana at all times 
---
People don't like when this sense is taken from them because even if you check your surroundings and aware, you are still roflstomped by a raid with 5 to 1 numbers advantage nowhere you go outside of the capital (ofc the area should be related to you as in give you valuable resources).
---
Your level is too low to feel it since people ignore your areas for the most part.
---
No.. even top 10ers on most servers hate it.  The way you get the top brackets is by throwing away your life and making yourself miserable.
---
Remember to spam this too.
---
You (Alliance) say Š 1 „ 1 Š 1 ‡ and Horde will read n o h o n o r
---
Huh, what do mages swap in before? Would like more information so next time I don't talk out of my ass.
---
How do you know if you passed crit cap?
---
Are you seriously trying to justify this? People who played vanilla knew the concequences of being camped on a PVP server, that's the warning and that's what they were expected do deal with. But this is of a different magnitude, it's literally unplayable because cheapskate Blizzard wanted to cram as many subsciptions as possible into a server.
---
Coulda done it without supporting such a garbage company for way cheaper too ;)
---
Ally
---
Spain has no PvE server.
---
Not telling you shouldn't enjoy and it's great if you do but if you were a lvl52 ally on some servers, the situation would be way different than lvl38 horde.
---
(really don't want to spoil the fun, just trying to explain the disappointment of some people)
---
&gt;then log back in
---
remove this step and you are good
---
I play with a consistent 160ms from Asia on the US servers and it’s entirely playable don’t worry, just make sure your actual internet connection is stable
---
&gt;there are a lot of non pvp alliance dominated servers
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-us
---
31 PVP/RPPVP, 11 PVE/RP. Around 3 to 1 ratio, although 2-3 PVP servers are Alliance dominated. The most populated servers in terms of raw numbers are all PVP. 
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-eu
---
34 PVP/RPPVP, 10 PVE/RP. Bit over 3 to 1 ratio, no PVP server in EU has apparent Alliance domination. All the top most crowded servers are PVP. If the crossrealm was limited by language, the ratio for EN would be crazy as there's just 3 EN-PVE realms.
---
If you're DR'd then you're clearly killing them and it wouldn't be a problem...
---
I keep seeing this. I thought you can't stack trinkets pi or ap in this patchn? Am I wrong ? I
---
For example, 
---
1. free transfer for horde and NOT an alliance.
---
2. Queues for hordes when the server imbalance is too high at any given time. 
---
Saying that complaints made what retail is today is just uninformed.
---
The game is based on 2 factions/teams and in which the development goal is and has always been to increase the balance to make the game as enjoyable for everyone in the player base.
---
Having servers where there is 20/80 factions balance, you surely cant say to them that they should "just be more organized"?
---
No. What we see today with wPvP is nothing more than another boring grind where they farm honor and try to do that in the most efficient way. A way where the honor vein (aka single player who gives honor) will die quickly and they can go forward to the next vein. Sometimes they encounter a huge group of honor veins who fight back, those are usually avoided as it takes to much time and isn't efficient to farm those.
---
Yes and these servers are linked into cross-server BGs. So over 100k players.
---
If the hunter just stands there watching, sure!
---
Prob playing peggle tbh
---
It makes even less sense when you see it's a quiver lol. When you run out of ammo you run up and.. hit them with your ammo?
---
You have admitted yourself as a strawman builder who is unable to read, that's what you have admitted :)
---
I mean, look very closely since I need all of your attention to couple of sentences, okay?
---
My phrase before:
---
&gt;However, based on latest census data, aliiance to horde ratio on all classic servers is 52 to 48
---
Ok? Alliant to horde ratio is 52:48.
---
Your conclusion:
---
&gt;Your own source said 52:48 H:A
---
Which is, you know, in reverse? A complete opposite? Your denial is so hard your own reading comprehension plays a sad trick on you and shows you are unable to read and understand a simple sentence. I wonder who is a literal moron here.
---
no food? grill some squids.
---
This isnt elitism. You're competing with tanks for gear and you slow down bis grinds (arena). Just level up.
---
You get what you deserve you ally scum.
---
I second that whole heartedly. How the f did that happen.........
---
Actually, tanking in raids is waaaay more effective than 5 mans thanks to GBoK spam for threat generation. Not even our top geared warrior can pick up Onyxia as fast as I can.
---
And crit is 100% useless for paladins right now since fights are over in 30 seconds. It’s practically impossible to oom on a healer until Naxx regardless.
---
This is one thing that makes rerolling away from my 56 shaman less annoying.
---
Finish fight at \~10% mana. Drink the very moment combat mode fades. Warrior charges into next pack as mana reaches \~20%. Keep drinking as long as it feels safe, get up, run forward to get in range, waste NS to heal the tank, barely make it through the pull ... and then the rogue goes "Dude how hard it is to drop a WF totem?".
---
Chain heal is awesome, but with these impatient pugs, 5-man healing on a shaman is pretty annoying.
---
It won't stop them from attacking anything they see though.
---
sorry, should be a little better
---
Holy shit. Was that on Thunderfury?
---
Bring back the OG survival talents for pure melee bonuses.
---
This does not make life for an alliance priest any easier
---
Don't think it work in friendly territories, didn't work in Ironforge
---
No
---
&gt; Have fun on that pve server with bwl on farm and no pvp.... No thanks, I'd rather go on a pvp server and maybe suffer a couple of weeks than playing ponytail-raidlogging pve servers. 
---
I've got a few friends playing on PvP servers that have a large enemy faction advantage, Most cases they're just raid-logging, unable to do anything else but raid log.
---
But hey, At least getting to BRM takes like 10-30+ corpse runs, right? super fun.
---
It's actually worse on stalagg, there's more horde in IF than alliance sometimes.
---
The horde basically own ALL the side streets near the ah/bank.
---
The portrait blinks. Showing its a honorless targer. 30 29 28 27 and so the counting starts.

---
the non-bis epics aren't that important, if someone plays a meme spec and leaves the guild because they aren't getting BiS, too bad. Not that huge of a deal, as long the more powerful items stay with the proper dps.
---
As an unguilded Resto shaman, I joined a 10-man (mainly all from one guild) group for UBRS yesterday, trying to get the Red Dragonscale recipe from Drak ....
---
Main tank occasionally calls out 'MB' on both /Raid and /Yell, clearly macro'd. All the casters would sit and start drinking, only for the tank to run out of LoS and pull the next group while myself and the other healer, a priest, are on about 25-30% mana ....
---
Priest pipes up, 'why even call MB if you are just going to pull?' ... No reply. Happens again several times before I chip in which pretty much the same comment, though slightly less .... polite .... again no reply.
---
If it had been a fab and cohesive group who knew what they were doing, I may not have minded so much but nothing was marked, dps are just killed whatever they like, mobs are running loose, tanks chasing them, leaving high danger mobs (like assassins) alive or un-cc'd so the group is taking heavy damage, things that are cc'd are being broken by aoe because why the fuck not .... It was a mess and we were literally healing on what little we could generate through mp5 and my mana totem so people died ... and that was apparently our fault....
---
We did manage to get Drak down, it was scrappy and people died, we we killed him, he didn't drop my recipe and I have decided I'm not going to heal for that guild again .... not really sure what I expected from a guild called &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; though....
---
True, griefers will still exist, but phase 1 level of ganking was acceptable for most people.
---
Really wow considered one of the most toxic communities??? You should see the moba one?
---
What is the addon that allows you to see other people’s talents? I’ve seen it a few times now but can’t seem to track it down.
---
Yes heals and WF!
---
I dont think so, it might be possible, but you can maybe pull 2-3 mobs and have to reg every few pulls.
---
With even a lvl 35 shaman you have basically 0 downtime if the shaman starts regging after each fight and you can clear a complete cathedral in about 10 minutes.
---
Also you need the bag space.
---
I'm having a hard time staying motivated tbh. I really just want to work on my main but there's nothing to do except raid (which I do but that's only about 4 hours per week) or farm gold for incredibly expensive shit like epic BOEs (freezing band for example). I enjoyed leveling the first time around, but it feels tedious now that I've done everything before just in the last few months,  and it's rather hard to find dungeon groups for anything below the level requirement of BRD.
---
I think it will change, you'll get much more honor in BGs. and it's much more fun since it's a fair fight. I don't think the ganksquads generally think it's that much fun to kill single targets in BRM.
---
Well, you don't have to respec for onyxia.
---
We do MC Tuesday/Wednesday every 2 weeks, with onyxia after Wednesday MC and Sundays.
---
You can do onyxia as pvp / farm spec on Sundays.
---
Even if you raid MC at one week intervals, it's still only one respec per week which you can easily afford as a mage.
---
You gain rank points once per week. DKs give you a rank point penalty, thats why it can be updated instantly.
---
What changes are you talking about specifically with this? 
---
The only things I can think of that are really affecting classic are:
---
1)the balance patch/talent build from much later in the actual games life cycle
---
2) the size of the server populations.
---
The first makes sense from a overall balance perspective (would anyone actually want 1.0.0 talent trees?) and a logistical one, if not where they put it, then where, and how often should they have updated the “balance patch” and in what iterations? 
---
The second comes from them hedging their bets too much when it came to how many people were going to play classic (see also:not opening up more servers pre-launch quickly enough) They also haven’t adjusted the games spawns of mobs or materials to accommodate for the higher population sizes. This also ties into the poorly thought out transfer system post launch which led to several servers having horribly unbalanced faction populations.
---
I can tell you that this absurdely bullshit. Me as a Fury DD and fury Tank can tell you if you have a Tank who hold threat no matter of you current DPS you will not stop and rather blame a tank who cannot hold aggro and simply replace him cause it baseline sucks. Incoming dmg is a joke to tanks so get your hitcap equip threat gear and push threat beyond your DD's or let people tank who are accualy able to pull it of.
---
Come on guys dont have such a high esteem of reddit.. it's a cool post, i like taurens
---
Gnomes and Undead are grossly over-represented compared to how popular they used to be.
---
Imho that's a reflection of everybody rolling a mage these days, and those are the go-to races for that class.
---
It's not really our fault though, we can't really speed up how much mana we get back by a huge margin. Some food (nightfin soup), or shaman totems help, but when you have a 6.3k mana pool, and that's before I have any epic gear) and the best mana food/drink (Argent Dawn rep Mana biscuits) you can get does only 4.4k over 30 seconds ... it's going to take time
---
i realy dont like most of the streamers, especial that neckbeard ASSmon.  
---
Soda is OKish, but fuck ASSmon, and it seems the mayority of this Sub agree's with mee.  
---
Im a simple man, i see ASSmon, i down vote !
---
i did dozens of strat, didn't try this! i will next time, thank you
---
Also true. With that in mind it's back to being clear cut!
---
I'd be down to transfer from PvP to PvE, provided I can get some decent guild.

Except if you miss the first two mauls it's more like 7 seconds

Streamer bad!

This. This video right here.
---
Ever since Classic’s release I’ve been trying to find my class. Old Hunter pvp videos are what got me interested in this game in the first place.
---
I currently am a level 20 mage, but this seals the deal. A Troll Hunter.
---
I’m super new to this game, and hope I’ll do Hunter’s justice. Thank you for this video man.
---
Do you mind if I ask for some tips? Like what are good keybindings (I’m an old keyboard noob), and what professions are good? 
---
Love this!
---
Lol harod
---
&gt;  or create a sub-subreddit specifically for memes
---
Nothing actually stops you doing that
---
These gankers are not spiteful people or mentally ill or somethin. I imagine they're having a blast on discord while hunting for anything that moves. Why? Who the [fk](https://f.ck) knows? Why are millions of people enjoy playing those cheap crap asian mobile games? If you knew you were a casual then you should have rolled pve like the rest of the adults.
---
Yes this. They don‘t care ofc but if they waste my time at least I waste theirs
---
DME Lashers + single invisible satyrs is fine to do as arcane power spec. I have 6100g farmed and I've not respecced once since hitting 60.
---
He got awfully quiet. Weird...
---
I sure hope you are just pretending or Roleplaying online Horde overlord or something, but Horde is beyond miserable on Horde higher % servers, enjoy the video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU5u3FC3jMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU5u3FC3jMA)  
---
Yes, Horde kills everything on sight on these servers because there is 2x the amount of Horde and they are thirsty for 1-10 honor.
---
yep
---
I am farming stuff in open world (Edgemaster Gloves, Essence of Air, Fire, Earth, Engineering Stuff, Arcanite Crystals).   
---
I think i start another toon only when i have enough gold to buy an epic mount for him \^\^
---
My current is a Hunter and I created it because I wanted easy leveling, be able to farm stuff solo, for farming gold and because i never played archer class in any game.
---
&gt; Always another dps fish in the sea, kick them and get another.
---
And then you wait for ~30 minutes for new DPS to arrive in BRD ...
---
You can't blow two trinkets at the same time, and PI does not stack with AP. But you can mix and match outside of that.
---
Don’t worry about defense until endgame when you’re able to stack enough of it to actually take advantage of the effects it provides. For now, take strength and stamina. When you can, snag spellpower. Int is nice to have, but don’t go out of your way for it unless you find yourself short on mana, as it only increases mana pool and spellcrit chance. Late game you’ll want to stack defense, dodge, etc., to prevent you from taking certain types of damage by pushing those attacks of your enemies hit table. Look into avoidance and crushing blow if you wanna understand more about how that works.
---
you can show the colours of each class in your raid group ...

bg's are x-realm LMAO sucker

You don't roll for quest rewards.

''As alliance'' 
---
Guys let's stop this shit you are doing the same damn shit all day long on other servers. Herod's BRM is infested with alliances 24/7. I haven't seen any alliances trying to pvp by themselves in a while, only some lv 50-60 dudes who are not even 60 yet. The rest are roaming death squads farming that ''sweet'' 10-20 honor per kills.

They don't care a little bit. I keep getting killed by 60s and I'm just level 31...
---
&gt;I don't even get it, the only thing they can possibly get out of this is a perceived sense of power.
---
I mean, that's a pretty big/important thing, why discount it with "I don't even get it" when a perceived sense of power more than adequately explains it?
---
I'm not saying it's good behavior, but it's plainly obvious that there's something enjoyable or entertaining in feeling that overpowered compared to your target.  For most people I'd imagine the enjoyment would be outweighed by the badness of feeling like a dick.  But for some people, like edgy teenagers, being a dick can even have it's own kind of appeal too.
---
You might not have personally experienced those things, but I think they're totally understandable human reactions.  It's just that some people are (if only at current time) dicks.
---
Why all these arbritary rules that won't fix anything?
---
People are going to get more Honor by doing BGs on December 10th. You'll still get people out there who want to PvP in the open world and that's fine, you and they rolled on a PvP server.
---
Aurastone hammer because healers can use that while mages and warlocks cannot. They also get Lok'amir during BWL next phase. It's straight up better for DPS casters by virtue of kill speed.
---
What do you mean by “greys”?
---
Playing either faction and acting like the other one is the one full of cunts.
---
Came from both vanilla and Kronos hating horde until I rolled one in classic.  Turns out both factions are cunts and it's just that horde have more people online.

Leveling is my favorite part of the game to be honest. I’m working on a Shadow Priest and it’s a tonne different than leveling as a tank.
---
I think I enjoy gearing and leveling because it fun to increase in power.
---
what is crazy that this was posted nearly two months ago (8.10.) and still in top again.
---
This. I only ever go low/oom on trash when the dps can't throttle their aggro. If keeping them alive threatens a wipe, I'll let them tank while I regen a little to keep the tank up. Better a somewhat bruised ego than a wipe.
---
We used to fill the last 10\~15 spots with randoms. Had 1 prot spec warrior, rest usually had 0 points in prot. MS debuffs everywhere. Shadow priest, feral druid, enhancement shaman in the raid. Most of the ranged DPS specced for PvP. Still cleared it fine.
---
I find it incredibly amusing to see people min/maxing this hard for MC. Who cares if you clear in 1 hour 28 mins or 1 hour 31 mins?
---
\*most players. Also i'd say average horde is still better at pvp then average ally.
---
Nah, I'm just going for R10 (maybe) and having fun in the meantime. I didn't imply Horde were better (or Alliance were pathetic) or anything, I don't get why you're projecting on me. I just wanted to share what the opinion on the other side is like because I saw a lot of suppositions I believe are false (at least for my server/guild/PvP groups).
---
And yeah, I think that video is hilarious.
---
area 51 aliens of course
---
just a personal observation that may contradict your statements.
---
I have had honorspy since the launch of the honor system. i play on Golemagg-EU. I've had up to 6k people in the honorspy table for the past 3 weeks. i have not had chat lag until last night. Never before.
---
Not trying to say honorspy is not the culprit here, nor am i supporting it, i just want to know what explains such behavior. btw its the same for all my friends and guildies on the server. chat lag only started as of last night around 20:00 server time.
---
When have you been ganked for 8 1/2 hours by the same player? if youre not even 40 yet
---
Are you dense? Someone asked if he’s the dude that shows his nuts, someone says “yes” and links a video. You couldn’t use your powers of deduction here and figure out you gonna see some testies?
---
Yes, let us transfer to PvE servers
---
I bet you make tons of friends telling your tank how how to play their class, people love that kind of thing.
---
I think the solution to what you're talking about is called "a PvE server".
---
48 actually.
---
&gt; Warcraft logs, WoWhead, and wowclassicpopulation
---
Those haven't been updated for months, ever since Blizz broke the census addon.
---
And the one one warcraft logs is only from raider, or something.
---
Just check the census sites and compare them to each other, all of them have completely different stats.
---
I hate these videos, cus they remind me the mistake i made not rolling horde warrior or shaman for windfury fun.. *cries in deep regret*
---
Have a good one

Underrated
---
Hotw is terrible but go feral?
---
😎
---
I can almost see what's going on underneath that UI  
---
3/10 needs more threat meter and pallypower
---
I joined a "social" leveling guild like this while leveling as alliance too. I quit after like two days because I had like a dozen people in the guild on the ignore list.
---
There still PvP but it's definitely heavy on alli
---
Currently rank 4 but would likely be 5 or maybe even 6 if I had spent the time assisting friend towards grinding honor. That’s good to know because I was under the belief that you did need to spend every waking hour getting honor.
---
Benediction is like 60/40. Horde outnunber Alliance nearly 2:1. You are in no position to condescend to people getting camped in cities on Skeram and Stalagg
---
1. if ragnaros submerges your raid lacks dps
---
2. the FR buff from ubrs is a HUGE boost for your healers mana
---
3. engineering is the best profession in the game by far, it's the only one where you get extra "abillities (sappers, grenades etc.) and almost everything made by other professions can be traded and used by everyone - it's not THAT important for pve but still a nice boost and it's absolutely essential in pvp
---
Demon takes only part of dmg
---
cc immunity would be op, it's not happening
---
yeah, that like with every farm run and xGold/PerHour..... ofcourse it is, when you dont die.  
---
Nobody is making any gold, while corpserunning ofcourse :D
---
They're gonna kill you anyway. You're just wasting your own time
---
PVP servers were different in vanilla wow.
---
PVP server doesn't mean people are allowed to be shitlords and ruin someone's else experience.
---
PVP server doesn't mean 40 man raids are allowed to corpse camp 1 poor dude.
---
&gt;Those haven't been updated for months, ever since Blizz broke the census addon.
---
The addon isn't broken and still functional. All Blizzard did was remove the ability to automate /who. The website is still being updated.
---
&gt;And the one one warcraft logs is only from raider, or something.
---
Why hello ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
such fun world pvp   
---
horde BG queue will be even more fun
---
Just open up another instance of wow while running, then you'd only lose the time of a load screen. So maybe like an extra 7seconds overall max. Seems decent if you want to do this to people tbh
---
And I know several people that go out of their way to hunt down and corpsecamp level 30s.
---
i didn't mean in this video, I mean its something the horde does in general.
---
Ya, I'm literally there 95% of my time
---
The game says otherwise. You're in the wrong here, wether you like it or not. The game gives honor for 60's killing 48's. That's how it is. That's how it was 15 years ago. We knew that back then, we knew it would happen again with Classic releasing.
---
Accept that or roll PvE.
---
I know right? it's amazing how so many people are whining non stop
---
this is a. exactly what I expected and b. exactly what I wanted
---
(don't get confused by my horde tag, 70/30 alliance favoured pvp server)
---
Mine says /e killed himself.
---
It's very funny, at least I think so.
---
I regularly use it when people tell terrible jokes.
---
Wow I heard about the gbok spam for threat generation. It's awesome news for prot pallies. Now I just have to convince our raid leader that it's a good idea:)
---
Weapon skill points: I am under the impression that to get a weapon skill point, X "hits" have to be performed with that weapon, where "X" is impacted by intelligence rating and the actual value (e.g., from 1 to 2 is faster than from 299 to 300)  
---
\--&gt; is there a formula how to calculate the number of hits ("X") required per skillpoint from 1 to 300?
---
Fake statistics made by horde.
---
If you go out in the open world and you can count, you can clearly see it's worse than 10v1 now on bigger servers.
---
nah, most of horde will quit because of BG queues and it all balances out, as usual
---
I'm pretty sure something like gothik or cthun are harder
---
They wouldn't know that they have it though.
---
Did it ever occur to you that when theres 25 people in a place it might be 5 groups of 5 and not 1 raid?
---
I'm Horde on Gehennas EU and I never kill people who don't give honor. I think it's really unhealthy for the game because it just increases the chance that the other faction will grow smaller. I'd hate to play on a server where you never saw any enemy players because they've given up, left, AFK in the city 24/7 now, etc. etc.
---
We got CLOSE during phase 1, our DPS was amazing honestly but we'd get to like 10-15% and he'd submerge (got him down to I believe 11% in our first run and then 14% and 15% in the other two runs).
---
How have I shifted the goals? There are guards outside of the zep tower &amp; outside of the boats. There are no guards on the zeps &amp; no guards on the boats. No matter how you twist this, you're wrong.
---
What you want, is for there to be no guards on the zeps, yet guards in the boats. Because you're biased &amp; lack self awareness.
---
*mic drop*
---
On of the fake data websites. Great proof.
---
Those who've been on Classic, or experienced it in some shape or form must've knew this would've happened. I made a wise call to roll on a PVE server as PVP is easily screwed with very few servers having a strong balance of both factions.
---
I'd rather be on a roleplay realm, rather than a PvP realm that makes the experience worse when behavior like this is endorsed.
---
Efficiency is everything. I give my healer about 2.5 seconds to spam that moonberry juice before i charge in guns blazing.
---
you have absolutely no idea what a horror it is to be a mage sometimes - sure it's some money we could make but it's like a wave of whispers every day over and over and over. People even get mad on you if you do not craft them anything cause you just want to play the game...
---
incorrect
---
zero enjoyment factor thanks to a horrendous UI
---
Definitely if you're spending that long per day in-game. I couldn't tell you how long it'll take but I'm pretty sure my GM is doing the same and said he'll be at it for 8 weeks.
---
Have three characters, with 2 bank slotd purchased all 14 slotters filled with all cooked squid.  Come July theses are going to turn a nice little profit.
---
On ther other hand, I had a bunch of times people leaving in the middle of the run (suddenly going offline suspiciously immediately after a wipe or something similar) and the rest of the dungeon suddenly got a lot easier with the replacement.
---
But, E.T. had better graphics than this does.
---
Ally also has Counterattack Lodestone.
---
attack alliance? OP is alliance, did you read the post?
---
No it's fine, i can feel the salt of skull alliance when they kill my alt. Taste close to them dying in BRM, but still a bit better.
---

Watch that. Now imagine doing that any time you want to run one of the three main endgame dungeons.
---
Still just makin memories for you, goober?
---
The wow community is considered one of the most toxic just on reddit. The in game community is super pleasant. I never had a problem on Mograine as alliance.
---
lv 55 elites vs 40 normal
---
take deep breaths and use your brain.
---
Relogging and rageloging are not the same
---
Why do you not transfer to a server which is balanced ? I’m getting ganked so much as a horde so it’s not a issue to be on alliance
---
If you have a problem with that, maybe you should think of the long term consequences of disabling the other factions ability to do anything outside of dungeons...
---
Nope, I am just not a douche, unlike some other people.
---
Everything but the imp. You could solo him as well as a lock, but you'll have to burn through quite a few invis pots and do some corpse running to get him to the end point.
---
If you arent playing with friends and on pvp, check your server balance. If it's bad, reroll while ur still low lvl
---
Here's something funny: Yesterday i was bored and visited the official German Blizzard forums (i am german) to check if PvP was still fucked and there were 2 threads where Horde players complained about Alliance transferring away and wanted Blizzard to stop Alliance transfers.
---
I had to train myself to restock on ammo every time I visited town.
---
Both

It's not a problem that they are cheap. However, implementing it in such a way that you can 'save' epics to get a bunch of crystals which will further reduce the price from 'cheap' to 'garbage' will make them pretty much worthless. To me that's a shame, cause a 'Nexus Crystal' should feel like an awesome crafting material that holds some decent value. It's kind of like those diamonds you get from BRD; they're so cheap that it's not even fun to loot them; I just destroy them instantly.
---
in bg's you don't know who your opponent is, this is prearranged combat so yes win trading.
---
The boat is the best way to get honor as a non rogue, non stealth, non 10 man sapper babby raid player.
---
It likely exists but I wouldn't really worry too much about it. Just smack shit and watch YouTube
---
I've been tanking since day 1. The mana of the healer decides when I pull. Very simple formula to avoid wiping :)
---
you mostly just need fire protection pots, you can farm the dreamfoil from DM lashers and the fire from elementals and then just give the mats to your guild alchemist
---
They dont work a lot of overtime maybe? One of our Guildmasters has a store where he sells appliances, a wife and two kids. He still manages to get aprox. 3-5 hours a day into the game.
---
If your way to work is not 1 hour each way, you should have about 7-8 hours of time after work to do all kinds of stuff.
---
In my situation that is aprox. 2 hours for tasks such as showering, making food, etc. And 5 hours are open for gaming.
---
One of my guildmates is a seasonal worker. He only works half the year. Other friends of mine work halftime. Aka. 20 hours a day. They earn enough that way to have everything they need.

---
We MAY lack some DPS, we got to about 11% of Rags' health when he submerged the first time. There was just no getting past that hurdle, the other two runs also couldn't finish him before the end of phase 1.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As for engineering consumables, don't those deal fire damage? I might build a whole bunch and then save them for the fight with Rags' next time around and see how I fare, especially as during certain points in phase 1 we're expected to stand back, so I'd still have a way of dealing damage at that point. However I'd probably be the only one utilizing them as like only 1 or 2 others are also engineers (or seems to only be a few).
---
First time I saw the races was at a cousin's PC. He was horde, but he told me to make whatever I want as I could switch servers if I wanted to play Ally. Didn't like the look of alliance at all. Wound up making a troll, don't remember which class I was at first because I didn't play too much until I got it on my own PC. When I did, made a new char, orc warlock.
---
Let me guess... you are playing alliance, right?
---
Sadly all zoomers before plaguing wow classic discovered that horde is the easier faction, and so we started with 65:35 imbalance on most server. As time progressed, situations like yours occurred and alliance folks just quit the game as it's not fun. The pvp is balanced in such a stupid way, that the numerical advantage is everything. You literally can't play with a few shitlords corpse camping you. You can't res, you can't escape, you can't take a flypath, you can't use a boat, you can't heartstone. If zoomers get you, you gotta just alt-f4 and play something else. Due to that now the ratio is more like 9:1 for horde on most servers. And it's especially bad on big servers like Firemaw, cause there you can be corpse camped by entire raids.
---
What I did, what my friends did and what I suggest for you is spam blizzard with support tickets. Cancel your subscription and make sure that they know why. Send them screenshots of horde spamming "go retail", t-bagging you or spamming n- and f- words, all this while corpse camping you and making it impossible for you to play the game.
---
I'm sure if more people does report that childish behavior of zoomers, blizzard will either start banning them or change the game.
---
Remember, those idiots that are so annoying ingame are looser irl. They have no money, they live with their parents, they cannot offer blizzard anything. If they start losing their mature, wealthy audience it will hurt their shareholders and changes will get implemented.

Read this and make sure your RL reads and explains to tank.

tl;dr melee (aside from 3 of them) can sit on ragnaros all fight without trying to outrange wor. It will definitely net you the lacking percentage to down him.
---
I agree on the 30g on average, but 3 runs per hour? You can do more with basic prebis and MC bow.
---
Is that a no? I know I can't cc the warlock because the pet will dispel it. Are you saying I can cc the pet and attacking the warlock won't break the cc?
---
The scorpions and spiders have pretty good vendor loot. The worms don't, but I guess a bot just kills everything in sight. I've farmed there plenty, it's nice and quiet because people don't go to Silithus much and there's a million acres of endless mobs. It's not like you can plant a bot at the water elemental spot in Felwood and expect it to get any farming done.
---
He said they can. I have the time to play 6 hours a day. I dont do it, but I could and I definitely did it during leveling and farming prebis.
---
So thats why the other day someone was complaining about chat lag on EU servers and I wasnt having any on the servers I was playing. Turns out bc Im not using that addon
---
Ah, thanks. Actually I didn't know I could farm dreamfoil via something I could hunt. This should certainly help me lift my weight and contribute to the guild.
---
DO NOT ROLL ON A PvP SERVER.
---
You cant.
---
doesnt even have to be bandaged, as soon as they see you refilling your lifepool, they heal ontop. deathcoil, stone, bandage, drain life. if your life goes down, you dont need a heal, but OH NO ITS GOING UP, BETTER HEAL THAT MOFO RIGHT NOW
---
I thought the goblins were the part of the horde and i couldn't grasp why their guards aren't attacking the alliance scum. I figured it's because they hide their faces behind those otherworldly cool helmets, so i came to the conclusion: in order to unveil them i have to attack them first. When i tried out my theory on a ?? mage in ratchet i felt like a freakin genius when the guards started running towards us. I did it, i unmasked the intruder. And then bam i was in the dirt and the mage stood like nothing happened in his strange &lt;Afk&gt; stance.
---
WEll, Vanilla was release late 2004. No smartphones, which means not many people were so used to getting everything in 2 seconds, "with one click".
---
So, when I tell someone like that, that I used to play on US from EU and grinded 8h+ a day, for 3 months, in a 95% win group, just to barely manage to get Rank 11, they look at me like I'm stupid.
---
Because, hey, you can cheat/cheap your way to honor today, because "F\*ck you, I'm not wasting 3 months on that".
---
To over-dramatize the issue: noone cares about the game, only rewards.
---
But, oh well, who cares what I think anyway \*shrug\*
---
They aren't supposed to interact with players in classic unless it's an issue near gamebreaking and happens a lot. They have even posted blue posts about limited interactions  with players.
---
That's why I was correcting him.
---
Looks like you have tons of room for junk.
---
["It was a non-damaging curse"](https://youtu.be/8SXMolmBSUs?t=469)

Think I've seen 4 or 5 on Gandling Eu so far. So not too uncommon.
---
I rerolled from earthfury NA to Hydraxian Waterlords EU which is a pve server. Andd what you know, I'm actually having fun again with no stress of being ganked

Any Hero can copy&amp;paste for those ones in work?

http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Gehennas
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4476_Gehennas
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/
---
If you compare this sites for the "Gehennas" you will see that deviation is quite significant based on their data. For instance they show different amount of player that are lvl 60 on the server. And the total ratio has a deviation of 10%.
---
I think the census can make decent approximation, but they aren't accurate and don't know which of them to believe.
---
Are you telling me Activision is picking cash over gameplay enjoyment? And their sheep *cough* I mean player base is ok with it?
---
Both are correct. The blizzard post was talking about a mechanic previously unknown, where if the weaponskill was above 10 your first hit doesn't count, thus requiring one more. Previously the community was unsure if your hitcap with 305 weaponskill was 8 or 9%. Turns out your miss chance is 8% but your hitcap is 9% as the first one is ignored. 
---
6% is proven without any doubt.
---
Todd, is that you?
---
You need to hit shit close to the weapon skill level. So weapon skill / 5 = hit that thing.
---
I had half my prebis by the time I reached level 60. It took two weeks or mediocre playing for me to get enough of it to be a strong raider. 
---
It takes 2 hours of farming per week to finance my progress raids and 2 hours of farming can pay for 3-4 weeks of farm raids. 
---
I also had all my professions on 300 by the time I was level 55.
---
Loool - can you sum?
---
Oh damn, thanks! I'm going to upload this to our discord, we were ALL standing well back and not DPSing for many times.
---
Damn...that's just...damn man. Thanks! This is gonna be a major help on our next raid!
---
&gt; What can Blizzard do?
---
Well they could start to incentive fairer fights. For example they could scale the honor according to how many players are engaged on each side:
---
* 2v1 -&gt; 80% of honor divided by 2
---
* 3v1 -&gt; 60% / 3
---
* 4v1 -&gt; 40% / 4
---
* etc (numbers are examples to show the concept)
---
They also need to better show that repeated kills give 25% less each time. Currently the estimated honor doesn't show that.
---
I hit 60 a few weeks back, not logged on since.
---
Why did FR stop being important? I remember applying for guilds as melee back in vanilla and needing to have 100-150 FR gear. Now, nobody cares.
---
And killing him before the sons was almost unheard of. Maybe people have just figured out the game now after years of private server play
---
F those guys.
---
How do you know it was 150? It only shows 50 people max when you /who.
---
This post is void without proper sources.
---
I don't know how you can identify the totem other than looking at your screen and see what's going on. The grounding totem is purple/blue-ish colored, and when you as a mage see this colored totem you can 100% be sure it's a grounding totem. 
---
In my opinion the shaman is the hardest encounter for a mage. What I've been doing so far is (both when getting jumped and when I am the one ganking) is to frost nova -&gt; get out of range of earth shock-&gt; cast 2x sheep. You can almost be sure the first sheep will be absorbed which is why I do 2 sheeps instantly (in case the 1st sheep isn't absorbed just cancel the cast of the 2nd). 
---
When the fight starts again on my terms (breaking sheep when ready) I try to do as much burst as possible on the initial go. And when he does the grounding totem again I'll try to remove it with rank 1 frostbolt, however if he uses the totem as a shield to heal himself (protection from counterspell) you need to get rid of the totem with fire blast.
---
2 people will only ever see this boss and this is why you love classic? LOL
---
yeah it's one of the most remote and quiet regions in the game (hence the only spot where you can farm soulshards for your raid in p2\^\^)
---
I misread your first post. Sorry.
---
Don't know if transferred via SL dmg can break CC.

You don't. Source: bought the leaf in vanilla.

&gt; whitemane is a shitshow for both sides

Imagine thinking it is in any way equivalent for both factions.

Good one.

Perfect comparison to a zombie apocalypse with All the undead rogues running around

I can sum, but not 40 people and I sure as hell won't summon your lazy ass from og bank roof to brackenwall village ;D

Every Horde city has a back door that’s actually to open the world.  The tram is deep into IF and SW, that’s not easy to get to.
---
my guild only got him past phase one on our first attempt, every week after that he's always gone down before that. We require everyone to have 6 greater fire protection pots for all of MC + Onyxia, usually reserved for ony and rag themselves. Other than that, as long as the dps is fine, you shouldn't have issues
---
Grats on picking the easy faction? Makes you sound like a coward.
---
and only on a select few bosses.
---
&gt;I read that a lot but it takes time to find one
---
Then four men it. 
---
Casters don't provide all that much on lower levels, the tank's going to do nearly half the damage of a run anyway.
---
How did you hit the 5 instances/hr cap when it takes a minimum of 30 minutes to get anywhere?
---
What is your /played?
---
This shows on whether it is time invested or just efficiency. I leveled slowly and reached 60 at 10 days in. 
---
I'm now at 17 days played. So I really toned down after reaching 60. I have some guildmates though who are between 27-37 days.
---
Yeah a bunch of dumpasses.
---
Had a pala tank the other day. If he ended the fight with 400 mana he would just run in and auto attack the next pack.
---
The video is of a rogue killing him mid video.  Rogues in major cities was common back in vanilla to.  This isnt like a raidfull of Horde just chilling in one of most heavy populated Alliance areas
---
Your entire post is bullshit and I hope nothing but bad things happen to you and your brother.
---
Have a crappy day.
---
And Wisp!
---
Well yeah ok. Shame they're exceptions :(
---
As a mage on an Alliance dominated server, I'll definitely be on the lookout for this trick. Thanks!
---
Is it normal for priest to be pulling only 1 creep per pull? As even with 2 mobs hitting me at once i am either dying or living through with a bit of my hp and mana left
---
First of all, thank you very much for the answer. Unfortunately, I do not get it.
---
According to Blizzard's blue post one has a miss chance of 8 % against a lvl 63 mob if one's weapon skill is 305 and the mob's defense is 315. And if I understand you correctly, you agree with this statement.   
---
So, If I do not want my yellow attacks to miss, I need to have 8 % hit and +5 weapon skill for the weapon type I am using.
---
Now, the other statement is that one has a 6 % chance to miss if one's weapon skill is 305 and the mob's defense is 315.   
---
So, If I do not want my yellow attacks to miss, I need to have 6 &amp; and +5 weapon skill for the weapon type I am using.
---
To me these statements are contradictory or is there an additional effect that I missed? Would you be so kind to elaborate?
---
If you just log out while dead, then log back in, you return with the Honorless Target debuff, so they won’t get any honor from you. I do this whenever Horde deathballs camp me, they stop very quickly.
---
You can use who for specific levels, classes or even names starting with a given letter.
---
I'm alliance and on the booty bay boat I once said  S T I N K Y  C O W  to a Tauren
---
pls no ban
---
thats me but 10x more tea etc
---
They def exploiting this safe spot and killing alliance on other servers idk a about yours but the one I play on for sure
---
When you go for a pvp server you have to take all the package, if you want only fair moments just play battlegrounds on a pve server, you can't chose a pvp server and whine about faction balance or being one shot by a roaming lv60 (well actually you can but imo it's not legit).
---
He probably had a vicious smile while killing you, knowing there was nothing you could do, that's a kind of good moments people can spend on the game if they want to.
---
Just handle this or switch to a pve server, DK are useless in this game
---
ITT: people too blind to see he's striking with the quiver instead of the melee weapon.
---
I remember an enchanter selling speed on boots for 6 gold. I fucked up though and gave him 8. Still worth it.
---
I just dont like procuring all these materials.
---
TBH it looks more like a guild getting the Fireres Buff from the Spellcasters in there for Ragnaros and not a P2 camping group.
---
Uff, why do you get so upset over harmless names?
---
i was in a bad group the other night.   I feel like only bad players group atm, but that's off topic.   The people were undergeared, and the healer kept running oom, so I was trying to pull slow.  So, the hunter starts pulling.
---
On Herod you die in while you're still in Redridge.
---
I agree with both these upstanding rogue gentlemen. Motion carries loot will be pass onto us.

You're right. Imagine not speccing anger management..

Great Video  mate !

Hello, are you alliance in ZT server by any chance? :)
---
most soulbags are bigger then equivalent normal bags (the soulbags from wl quests where always bigger than my bags during leveling and I leveled tailoring alongside and now I have 4 16slot bags and a 24 slot soulbag)
---
and I really like that the soulshards get auto placed in the soulbag so you inventory sorts itself a little bit
---
Nice. Too bad you rolled the nastiest looking race
---
I know right? How dare I suggest organizing in a *massively multiplayer* online game...
---
In this thread, horde on horde servers telling Alliance that from their 60-40 side its not that bad.
---
Christ man create an ally char and go see for yourself you delusional idiots.
---
&gt;Just for reference, it's $75 (subs are only $5/mo.)
---
Whatever the fuck for? 
---
Who's PAYING for this nonsense? I thought you could watch those Asmongolds for free?
---
Well populated servers have a lot of people farming and disenchanting.
---
Dude seriously thinks 4% faction population could be accurate lmao
---
AQ40 is awful. I just hate the bugs and caves in general. And AQ40 in particular is notorious for the masses of bugs scattered along the tunnels. It took a hell lot of time to clear them all out.
---
I like WPVP because I play during off hours. Plenty of ganking but not headache inducing. I really feel for those that joined a PVP high-pop server and play during peak hours. Masochists
---
There’s someone in my guild that we raid with often. She seems to think she knows everything and every single piece of gear that drops (even greens) she constantly is telling who to roll on it. 
---
Some of our guild members are new to WoW so they usually listen to her. 
---
I’m bringing this up because I could absolutely hear her telling our tank to roll on this “because it has stam and fire resistance”. Obviously it’s meant for a caster/healer but I swear she does shit like this all the time. 
---
Not saying that was the case here, since this dude doesn’t appear to be a tank but  there are some delusional/misinformed people out there.
---
You don’t get anything meaningful from daily dungeon or weekly lfr. I believe in BFA they are there only for the absolute beginner players. Maybe I did 1 daily dungeon and 1 lfr in the past 1.5 years.
---
I agree there are endless things you can do in retail, but if you want gear like in classic then 1 m+, 1 raid, and half hour of island expedition gives the most for the least amount of time.

Unpopular opinion:
---
Maybe he won by greed roll, the ring got more stamina over his previous ring, and he need some fire resist, completely understandable
---
Only if you attack back though.
---
not "everyone" raced to 60. A lot of people don't even have a 60 yet. Some have multiple 60s. Some have multiple chars in their 30s and 40s. There are thousands of players per server per faction. Most people aren't even participating in PvP.
---
You see a minority and think that's "all players"
---
Tank moved when rl made the call to move back.  Dps was busy typing, pulled and got wrecked.  
---
LOL
---
It is not simply hunters farming dm tribute. I make 40 blues in 1.5-2 hours of farming dme.
---
It's not surprising AT ALL. Who leads the collusion? Streamers. Whose going to take their 20,000 drone army away and cost blizzard thousands of subs when they get punished and quit Classic? Streamers. These are people who have their cults who are paying WoW subs solely so they can come and sniff their farts while they AFK in town because standing next to the streamer means you're cool.
---
This is nothing new at all, not to WoW or to streaming in general. Big streamers get away with everything short of straight up hacking in games now, every standard TOS violation that would send you or me packing doesn't get them punished at all. They're too valuable to the brand.
---
Dude, you are projecting hardcore. You said I have  “no concept” of what I’m talking about. I have a lvl 60. I’ve done the BRM death march. I’ve been ganked and killed randomly many many times. Just because you want something to rail against doesn’t mean I’ll let you talk smack at me. You’ve got a stick up your ass. Also, calling me a boomer? Haha Jesus that’s all you’ve got. I hate to burst your bubble but I’m a millennial. You assume so much and know so little. Go back to whatever troll hole you crawled out of you sad little person.
---
yes but thats the way it is without BGs tho. once BGs are out most pvpers will only be out and about for farming and running to dungeons with the random city raids and stuff. i played vanilla during the 6week period of honor without BGs and ive played pservers that did the same patch rollout method, and it's always this way.
---
Oh warrior brother, rogues don’t really need the help like we do.
---
But alliance atleast has honor.
---
&gt;and I really like that the soulshards get auto placed in the soulbag so you inventory sorts itself a little bit
---
Yeah, its dam satisfying. But if you are running out of bagspace constantly you can just say fuck it and get another bag.
---
Also as a lock, you should still claim priority on Onyxia's bag anyways.
---
No problem, read the whole comments to the post, since various issues are described there like how to check GUID, how to assign dedicated healers to wor soakers and so on. I hope he is down soon for you :)
---
This is my first time playing Alliance (other than the occasional alt back in the day) because my friends rolled Ally for Classic. Now I have convinced myself Horde is a Savage faction played by middle schoolers. Also playing Gnome has been pretty fun especially because I never thought I would. My other two most played characters were Tauren 😂.
---
Because every raid I joined had a leader disband it within 5 minutes. I'd jump out and in to not get ported
---
How exactly?
---
Yes, it's normal in classic.  
---
Majority of classes can't handle 2+ mobs at the same time.  
---
IIRC only hunts and warlocks could do multipuls.
---
Does your rank depend on your performance compared to your faction, realm, realm pool or region?
---
Well since Ragnaros is immune to fire damage. ...
---
Or you can stop being a dick, standing around with 10% HP, while I'm drinking for the full duration of my water to fill my completely empty mana, waiting to be healed because you're a cheap sack of shit.
---
I can't win, but I can make sure you won't win either!
---
Bots are a problem. The mats they keep reasonable are cutting profits from actual players that do the farm legit. The gold they generate from vendor and auction house gets sold to whales on your server. Every bot you see is selling gold to someone on your faction. Players are taking that gold to buy up scarce items on the auction house.
---
This would be great for hunters
---
It also affected by mob level.  
---
You could reach 300 by hitting level 1 critters, but it will take much-much longer than on level 60 mobs.
---
Have leveled a lot there and havent had any pvp problems actually
---
&gt; why do you get so upset
---
It's not about being upset. Just ya know, trying to fuck the horde any way I can.
---
You mean walk into dm west, die, und just corpse run into dm north? That works?
---
You can't prioritize healers by just reading your combat log in even a small BRM skirmish.  Don't be dense.  There's a reason the addon is so popular and it's not because it saves you from some light reading.
---
https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html
---
How can I get into dm north without a key or without being a rogue? My engineering charge doesn't seem to work.
---
This got me so hype for my respec at 60! I cant wait!
---
How do you feel about a 1 button macro cycle for Wing Clip, Raptor Strike and even disengage?
---
And does slowness of pet Prowl ever fuck you over?
---
Haha eat shit you pathetic baby
---
Yea but there's a finite amount of room for your trade spam, and you really want to advertise as many enchants as possible.
---
I would appreciate someone reaching out to me while tanking with usefull information on how to tank.
---
On Firemaw I've seen nothing but alliance PvP raids, I dont think that server is that unbalance tbh
---
&gt; What if I have better gear then them?
---
Would you engage someone who is way more geared than you in 1v1? Probably not.
---
Its a chain that starts with collecting soil in ungoro then the follow up is to turn in 10 grain, then it becomes repeatable. Grain can be purchased off AH.
---
cause the post is just an insult type thing towards pvp servers
---
I don't have herbalism, but there are many herbs on this route that you will naturally see around you. But you should probably google the exact locations.
---
Quest opens up at 50
---
You’re level 38.
---
10 more levels and this post would be completely different.
---
Okay... All I'm saying is the ganking in brm videos are a better example of the faction imbalance issues than the rogues in IF as that same server likely has ally rogues in orgrimmar too
---
while at that: dear paladin tanks,
---
your judgement of wisdom proccs generate threat for you, which is not tracked by threat meter addons.
---
in fact, it's a shitload of threat when put with rets/hunters and your casters are bored, thus smashing their wands.
---
Also, GBoK is a nice aoe threat bump
---
Priests specialize in being able to chain pull 1 mob after the  other without having to drink.
---
Hit a lvl 60 mob.
---
Pro tip to not get ganked in IF : Right click on player icon -&gt; disable PvP
---
Why
---
It's like wearing nothing at all
---
exactly! how dare he value other sides of the gameplay than you! his mentality is obviously at fault!
---
But rogues too, they can wait at flightpath all day
---
I don't see how you can call reporting inappropriate names abusing the system that's put in place for people to...report inappropriate names.
---
Now my *reasons* are absolutely impure since I'm doing it purely about of malignancy rather than actual offense. But I don't think that should really matter.
---
And well, if a name is really fine, I'm sure there's some way to appeal the name change. Although something tells me they'd err on the side of caution with this one.
---
I don't have space to replace another bag with a soulbag, how do you do it?
---
probably, we down her in about 3:30 minutes so it's not exactly necessary
---
Blizzard literally don’t care as long as you’re still paying your sub. If you want them to notice you, you know what to do.
---
they cant even see that you're honorless unless a mage does detect magic on you.
---
what is this passive aggressive bulshit? r/ShittyLifeProTips/?
---
I always wonder why people don't level it. Even a healer should. I mean, you get tonnes of various cloth, easily enough to get 300/300 first aid with, without having to buy any from the AH.
---
I don't think that would make things better. I'd still just be standing behind Boss X, pressing sinister strike, SnD and evis once in a while.
---
I might have to reroll to heal, maybe it'll break the monotony.
---
Implying alliance never outnumbers horde. Naive mong.
---
do you use your 60 Warlock to revenge your priest in STV?
---
Someone is truly angry over something so pointless.
---
Go onto an alliance dominated server as horde and repeat that.
---
The problem is not any one faction, the problem is the dominant faction on that server. They're not running around offering tea on heartseeker.
---
You can yes. But not if you are undergeared or have a harder situation come up.
---
As a shaman I barely manage to keep groups on the DM West ghosts alive and this is with deep resto and 444 extra healing.
---
This is the correct answer!
---
Look at atlas loot and look at boss levels in your character range. Ask an inn keeper what dungeons you should do. Type 50 tank lfg in chat and see where people invite you.
---
I assumed the "..Wrath" statement was some pserver observation and that it should work the same way as "..by up to X damage" - cheers for testing it out and confirming!
---
&gt;Try to mass report a person and you'll quickly see him disconnect.
---
I havn't had the pleasure of seeing that. The closest was a particular orc who cross-faction translating something vaguely close to the N word.
---
Made sure people jumped on reporting that one. You *know* that's gonna be a ban. He did disappear, but I'm not sure it's related to the reports as I can't say that language reports result in the phenomenon you're describing.
---
Why is everyone acting like only Horde does this.
---
Be a night elf xd
---
++.  My money is that the healer doesn’t drink when the pull is over.  All the good healers on my flist will drink while I make the next pull and pop up to start healing mid fight.
---
I think they mean the back entrance to east.
---
I understand that reference.
---
says Spy should be banned -&gt; uses Spy
---
THICC
---
clearly
---
On pservers people geared for like 10%+ hit or so in naxx. But with HS queueing it's probably not going to happen in classic.
---
Ask someone to open the door for you? Or even better, run DME for the key.
---
I feel like people just see a post and instantly think one way and unload into their comment.
---
Read my other comments.
---
later cr
---
It depends on the faction on your realm.
---
non-locks seem to have some aversion to using healthstones
---
in 5man I always give out a healthstone to every one in the beginning and 9/10 times after a whipe or close call I ask if anyone needs new hs and everyone says nope still have mine
---
in raids I post "&lt;- tanks and healers trade me anytime for healthstone" and it's maybe 1 in 3 raids that a person comes up to me for a hs and it's always before the raid started and I'm sure the same hs still sits in their inventory when they hearth out after rag
---
Its a horde player on a horde server. He doesnt know whats its like on the other side.
---
Most tanks selling services are already geared, and for them to tank a dungeon instead of farming other stuff there needs to be incentive for them to do dungeons instead of their farms.  
---
So if there's a shortage of tanks for dungeons, no normal tank, that has ll the gear will do it for free for random people.  
---
As a dps i prefer tanks selling runs, instead of looking for group for 1 hour for there to be no tank online that needs that specific dungeons. Theres one mor upside to this in my experience, as the tanks selling their services most of the time already have the gear you'd usually roll against, and since he get's paid per dungeon it's in his interest to make it as fast as possible.
---
Noone is making a point that you should pay every tank just because he's a tank.
---
 But if people are willing to pay for a "premium" tank to speed up gearing or leveling process i see no harm in that. These tanks are minority and usually do these runs more efficient thn pug tanks.
---
Are you bitching about mages getting paid for portals/tp's /food aswell?
---
That's better but not enough.
---
Now, where is the data ?  
---
How do we know you're measuring an average data transfer and not a maximum over 1 hour ?  
---
How do we know you don't have caching messing up with your test ?
---
There probably is a code smell but you may also be too critical about it.
---
Because not all 60's can kill other 60's. Need to kill what you can.
---
I put my targeting on scroll wheel
---
Why didn't you do this with a larger amount of spell power items? Feels like you made your life much muh harder....
---
As an elemental shaman I was able to kill 2-3 mobs at once as well. Mage I can also kill several mobs.

Not angry, calling out garbage content. 
---
Camp boats all you want, camp flight paths all you want. But when 95% of the fights you take are you outnumbering the opposing faction 2 or 3 to 1 and you think that's skill? That's garbage content. When someone does this for HOURS and these clips are the best they can do from camping a boat all day, that's garbage content.
---
I fucking hate the mice and roches....  im forced to use oil of immolation if I have a questionable healer.
---
No, I'm pretty sure that message doesn't appear when killing an honorless target.
---
Even better, when they start pulling you implement the "you pull it, you tank it" policy. See how long that lasts then. After a couple pieces of gear break I'll bet they chill out.
---
Your opinion is wrong.  The healers I play with are just fine at half mana, and will sit immediately after the pull is over and drink while I make the next pull.  They will pop up and start healing when I’ve taken some dmg.  
---
Healers who require a full mana bar to heal are doing it wrong.  I had one who refused to heal unless his mana bar is full, which doesn’t make any sense.
---
You're a moron
---
Mage pvp is amazing. I've never been into pvp before, but since I started leveling my mage alt (level 43 atm) I have been getting into as much wpvp as I can and I am having the best time I've ever had in WoW.
---
Are we playing the same heartseeker. I literally quit wpvp because It’s just a stomp 100% of the time. Waiting on bgs because we have literally every placed camped.
---
Somebody give this man a cookie !
---
Its just these kind of social ranking systems by design are always going to have abuse in them. Especially for larger servers.
---
Paladin I suppose? You should be assigned to either spamming the tank, or playing whack-a-mole with raid healthbars. Literally pick whoever's lowest and flash them, repeat until raid is over. If it gets sniped, that's too bad, but you can't do anything about it anyway, because canceling the heal would incur the same GCD as letting it go through.
---
&gt; how dare he value other sides of the gameplay than you!
---
You mean PvE? I think we got entire realms for that specific part of the game. You know, servers where PvP isn't enabled by default. It's great for those that won't understand what PvP is.
---
How did you get both? Other rogues must be pissed.
---
lol what are you talking about? 1h queue? What?
---
No. No honor flashes on the screen or chat if they're honorless
---
Don't think we know yet? It's been pretty hectic so far, with some servers seeing him two days in a row and others waiting almost a full week.
---
Ofcourse it isn't. Hunters do most of their attacking as ranged physical dmg. It isn't melee.
---
The opposite of melee is ranged. The opposit of caster dmg is physical dmg. Warriors and rogues are example of physical melee dmg dealers. Hunters are physical ranged. Mages and warlocks are caster ranged.
---
No idea why I get downvoted. What I am saying is correct and to the point.
---
I'm alliance and everyone who cries about PvP in PvP servers are morons. There, you happy now?
---
U dont even need to be prot to tank dungeons. Watch videos learn up go fury grab your favorite two hand or sword and board and start hitting things. Keep a good head on your shoulders and hopefully the people around you will follow suit

That's a bit of a joke these days tbh. I got up at seven in the morning on a week day and went down, there were still three people tagging mobs.
---
For some items yes, I promise you the 0.5% items will always maintain their value
---
This is a matter best cleared up with your own guild, as different guilds probably have different guild rules. All this was pretty clearly stated in guild rules on my current guilds' Discord server, for us you're a trial until after attending 10 raids. That doesn't mean you won't get any loot, by any means, but you probably won't be getting, say, Onyxia weapons or Mageblade if a raider needs them. Pretty easy to understand if you look at it from the guild's point of view, since how would they know you after 1 or 2 raids, or if you will stick around after getting it? Not that there are any magical guarantees after 10 raids either, but at least you guys know each other better.
---
I mean, he's right.
---
yeah right

If you're planning on raiding, there's getting attuned for Onyxia and MC.

I recommend saving a bunch of level 50+ quests untill you reach 60. Once you're 60, quest xp is turned into gold (6 copper per point of xp iirc) - which can get you a pretty good stack of gold.
---
Yeah but it will defenitely help with the Problem.
---
As I see it - Horde has a Long trip to BRM. I think it will defenitely better the Situation in Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge because a lot of People will rather go to Winterspring because they don't have to fly as Long.
---
It won't fix the Problem but it will better it to a Point where it isn't a Problem anymore and just becomes World PVP. Like it is supposed to be
---
Who said something about giving up?
---
Just another character you can log onto and chill for those moments you ain’t having fun on your main thanks to world pvp. A wow safe space.
---
ahah someone actually legit made a pvp video about killing low levels on the boat  
---
this is new levels of sad
---
OP said he had agro on all but the rat pack that kill most trigger happy dps 🤣
---
Naughty warlocks only get renew. Signed, your priest.
---
wow classic has updated the census addon 18 days ago and it was updated before. Appspot just taken place of wowclassic pop while it was down iirc, now it's irrelevant. The other site is literally who, seems to be some kind of replacements as well.
---
which three?
---
That idiot getting favored by Blizzard.
---
Have you tried using psychic scream? Of course, pay attention to your surroundings since an unlucky fear can end up pulling even more mobs.
---
You can pull like 4-5 mobs, dot them all, fear and wand, then dot and fear again when they come back. But in practice it doesn't seem any faster than killing them one by one, considering you have to drink to full after such pulls. It's handy when you're questing in a high traffic area since you get to tag more mobs.
---
As far as I know, Honor is the only think we care about, you get Zerg at every FP because every player want to tag you in case you do hostile action and lose honorless buff.
---
There seems to be a misconception about Horde that this is somewhat organized, but the wast majority there is solo player trying to leech as many HKs from other as they can.
---
This will be greatly reduced when the BGs come out, which is not that far away thankfully.
---
As for the gray targets, there are people doing it on purpose, but all of mine (2) is just me not noticing its gray.
---
Same shit is going on on Arcanite Reaper, but of course, nobody will care
---
Nah it was disprove from what I remember. Same with chromaggus breaths determining Bed brood spawns.
---
*Laughs in mage*
---
Download details damage meter, then there is an option to pop out the threat meter, it seems to be the most accurate
---
You are also forgetting you need a healer for warrior to do jump runs, warlock can do it solo...
---
And ofc warrios use same spec for everything from pvp, raids, farm,...  unlike warlock that has to respec. Smh...
---
Once right before rezing
---
implying you don't know statistics
---
If you read the ingame description for dk's the get exponentialy worse the more you have in a 24hr time period.
---
Yeah hes a cunt
---
Vanilla wow is a sandbox and is all about player choice. You play the game how you like it.
---
That's a big playerbase.
---
From my understanding it has to be done on two separate wow accounts on the same email.
---
So you know when you launch battle net and you can choose which account it logs into? 2 of those active.
---
Also was his toon over 30?
---
Yeah, except you can literally disable PvP and be immune to this. You do realize that videos like this just makes the actual problem seem much less bad?
---
Meanwhile blizzard doesnt take their own advice. Let's everyone transfer off their realms... twice.
---
Take your gear off and die in front of the door to mobs and then run back and rez inside.
---
They can do it all they want, it probably makes good honor. But the second they thinks this takes any amount of skill or they are proud of this, thinking they are good at the game by making a shit quality video, then that's when this goes from being sad to fucking cringe.
---
Sounds like you are having more a problem with the Rogue PvE playstyle/rotation than encounters themselves, maybe?
---
Healer here myself and find it pretty fun (even if the content isn't the most challenging so far), especially if some healer dies early or disconnects, more to do then. If your guild brings 10 healers (or more) to MC, however, it can get snoozy. At least if a few of them play decently well, less of the cake left for you.
---
&gt; Range is also a factor (so some time it might seem like she's hitting people lower on the threatlist but it's mostly because people higher is out of range)
---
If that worked, you'd be able to bypass the entire mechanic by having your tank stand on the far side.
---
&gt;in raids I post "&lt;- tanks and healers trade me anytime for healthstone" and it's maybe 1 in 3 raids that a person comes up to me for a hs and it's always before the raid started
---
Tanks should always have healtstone, but no point giving it to anyone else (unless there is a lot of warlocks in the raid) it just takes too long to trade them out, and its the same for summons. It just takes too long.
---
But the point is that there is almost never a situation where you need a huge soulbag, like maybe if you are using Shadowburn a lot in your rotation, but besides that you should just refill throughout the raid anyways and don't more than 4-5ish in your bag at any time.
---
I’ve tried that also.
---
And yes he changed his level 60.
---
I'm not, I don't live for a stupid game. 
---
Played and conquered, killed those ridiculous easy raid bosses for more than 12 times until I asked myself "Wtf Im doing with my time".
---
And don't start with the "In AQ and Naxx things are much more harder!"
---
No they aren't because when those raids drop guilds like APES will have cleared in 1.5 hours..
---
Let's see if they can WF mythic raids in less than a week on retail lol
---
I don't care about themepark MMO anymore and If I did I would be playing a much better themepark like retail. I bet 80% of "Classic players" will be there when Shadowlands launch.
---
Not true. Look at most contested areas. Horde get better hub locations, a FP where many alliance don't, and simply have more quests.
---
My biggest regret was transfering there, quit the game as a result
---
That made me genuinely uncomfortable
---
Where’d you get this number, source?
---
&gt;This post is void without proper sources.
---
No, it's not. Get over yourself, dickhead.
---
Hm, can you paste link to stream?
---
The biggest problem with mages is, it can take my health down faster than I can press use healthstone button :)
---
Don't make a choice assuming you'll be able to transfer, that could change whenever Blizzard wants, and I don't think you can even transfer from PvE to PvP at all.
---
If you want to play on a PvP server, you can. The first couple of zones you level in will not be "contested", which means you can turn PvP off as if you were playing on a PvE server. Which means you could in theory get to something like 20-25 without getting ganked. If you level slowly, you could stretch these levels out to the 10th, and just continue from there.
---
Well assuming that you have twice the players on horde queueing only half of the horde is in BGs at any given time. The other half is farming alliance out in the world. 
---
Lets call the half in the BGs horde1 and the one in the world horde2. When horde1 ends the BG, horde2 take their place fighting against the alliance. Now horde1 has to wait the duration of a whole game in order to get a new pop. Depending on game duration and faction imbalance 1h queue could be possible.
---
I really think so, I’ve reviewed what he did multiple times and none of the methods line up.
---
And I asked a GM and he knew Sodapoppin received one.
---
Looks like those mega servers were a mistake after all.
---
Relax dude its just a video.
---
Yes but have you thought of their feelings?
---
Oh I'm horde on a horde dominated server so it's not really like I'm suffering that much, just that I feel the system is broken.
---
Where is the fun to gank allies when you are twice their number and there's no challenge? 
---
And, as someone lvl52 at the moment, it's so ridiculous from a game design point of view that I grant honor to lvl60. I mean I'm totally ok that I can be killed by those who wants to but why the game reward this? I'm not even mad at people who gank me because it's not even like they are being asshole but they just follow the rules of the (broken) system.
---
350g is good. On my server, it is always between 100..150g.
---
There's one in undead strat, it looks pretty cool too. It's white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape.
---
people seem desperate for tanks, so I wouldnt like to jump in somewhere over my head.
---
Iirc at lvl 50 I started tanking Mara. On lvl 53I went to BRD, all the way to 58.On 58 I started going to Strat live and Scholo (Scolo was a bitch). I was Arms/prot and I was generally OK.
---
So I started my Level 19 twink about a month ago. 
---
I really loved leveling a rogue. 
---
When PVP came out I mained for a bit to farm honor and realized that I am vastly outnumbered by Horde. 
---
I had no fun.
---
Now my twink is Level 46 and waiting to get to 60 so I can kill all those pesky Horde Players that have been ganking my main which has made me very sad.
---
I gave up on 19 twinking so I could kill Horde...
---
I will pick it up again though! Not a rogue as I have no realized since I dropped the lvl19 BiS legs for casters while leveling my rogue :D 
---
So it is most likely going to be a priest. 
---
I will Keep you updated once I have actually started :)
---
You sound like a Real Gamer, very tough, much respec. 
---
Anyway, unlike most PvP realms our wpvp is quite balanced between factions, takes place without raid ganking with usually larger running pitched battles. And allies and horde know each other and engage competitively, people peeling off for 1v1s because they want to challenge each other, not just farm honor. 
---
It's actually kind of fun. 
---
Which is probably why you think it's not hardcore enough?
---
Depends what you are trying to do. If people want to maximise their raid dps of course they are going to pick an optimal spec.
---
SL and Conflag builds are good for PvP, SM/DS is good for gold farming.
---
lmao holy fuck you are on earthfury.  You transfered out as horde.  Fucking pathetic.  One of the tiniest servers in the game plus, you rolled horde, your experience has nothing to do with this post.
---
That Proxx and his friends have been in UC entrance since phase 2 hit, I'm so surprised they aren't bored yet... It's the same at DM entrance, the same 5-10 people are there every day, get wiped by a horde raid and wait for them to move on to continue killing single targets, must be good honor lol
---
Sounds like you just yet off on trolling and grieving people.
---
u/VredditDownloader

I can smell the salt from here

Have you thought about rerolling on a PvE server? There's much less chance of that happening as a lot less people do wPvP.

Look into your BIS list + MC and Ony Pre
---
Yeah man! We need more of these players on alliance.
---
I have 10add ons and still can't see the fucking numbers of hp/mp... That game is so scuffed you need 15add ons to play it properly lmao
---
Hi,
---
I will definitely go twink 19 tauren hunter, already almost full bis (i still need trinket, bracers and gloves)
---
Dont know if there will be some twink guilds on my server (dragonfang EU) but we will see :)
---
Try to complete your attunement quests from MC and Ony ASAP. 
---
Start working on your pre raid BiS gear. Anything you can get out in the world or BRD are a good place to start. 
---
Start saving gold or the materials for your mount quest.
---
What u talking about paladins????? in a ally bg premade with a couple of paladins they will rekt thru horde rolling with shammys! Palas r basically broken in pvp, they do everything and anything and shammys r...well, just there.
---
btw, rogues r broken for wpvp 1on1 or 1v2 if they know what they r doing. in a bg not so much, they r imba wsg flag defenders however.
---
Nope, do just fine with mages and such. 👍🏼
---
kicking is a retail thing
---
Maraudon 48\~49ish
---
Sunken Temple 52\~53ish
---
BRD 56\~57ish
---
The rest 58+
---
Those are fairly safe levels, you can go a bit earlier - but might run into issues.
---

Roughly 9:15 time stamp
---
You dont need as much mana as you think you do.
---
On top of that, every single dungeon entrance is further away for alliance (except brm-which is horde territory on skeram anyway)
---
You do realise wetlands is contested territory? lmao
---
Is using Keris of Zul'Serak (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12582/keris-of-zulserak) in raids an issue? Can the debuff be applied to raid trash/bosses?
---
Its probably flameguard gauntlets
---
TellMeWhen
---
Were you not provided healing assignments?
---
Most folks will give you a group or priority target to heal. 
---
As for performance, if all the bosses died you did your job. 
---
On the side of “input overload” are you using any addons to help manage the flow of info or just raw dogging it?
---
On private servers they allowed the quest to be done a week before releasing the raid so it wasn't that big of a hassle. They should look in to doing something similar, otherwise world first raid clears wont be as good since some guilds might get bottlenecked at the quartermaster.
---
There are streamers I watch often and really enjoy watching.  The hours of entertainment I get out of it are, in my opinion, well worth a fiver a month, so I gladly contribute. If you don't feel they deserve it, don't give them money.
---
This is just like MTX-only monetization in games,  you should only contribute if you want to help out the devs and make sure they can keep making good stuff in the future, or if you're loaded and money is of no concern for you.
---
You can do mara without gear but I would recommend farming most of your pre raid bis first. You don't have an immediate need for gold, and you actually make quite good money just from running dungeons and vendoring the stuff that you greed roll.
---
LMFAOOOO
---
Abso-fucking-lutely. We get the world bosses due to numbers, but entering BRM/DM with buffs is impossible.
---
Still waiting for that mass ban wave. Any minute now. Just wait and see guys. Soon enough blizzard has enough data. Maybe another 2-3 months will do?
---
&gt; Blizzard ban wave
---
&gt; 2 days later undetected bot released &gt; Another 6 months of collecting data.
---
Honestly fuck that system. Insta bann on behaviour and ticket count and stop trying to outsmart the botters, 15 years of experience say blizzard can’t do it.
---
Closing and deleting a thread are two separate things.
---
They'd sure care if a repeatedly ganked player of the opposing faction become a dishonourable target (instead of honourless) for a short period. The more they're ganked the longer they would be considered a dishonourable target for the opposing faction. Such a simple and elegant solution to the current situation and IT WOULD WORK. Who the hell wants to get DKs?
---
Instead though the players are too dumb to consider it and so is Blizzard.
---
And which part is it that you wish me to retract exactly?
---
Flying mounts remove travel and a lot of wPvP. I don't need to have played them to know the obvious. 
---
A lot of content in classic is condensed into endgame, so whilst leveling content becomes invalidated (well some of it isn't due to how classic is designed, dungeon farming for instance), a lot of the raids etc are still replayed or at least necessary to play through on a character.
---
However, wouldn't you just be able to level past all the Classic endgame raids and dungeons in TBC making them more irrelevant than before, where they were still relevant/necessary despite not being the most recent tier?
---
On one side we have \*dumb\* healer who complains about life tap and on the other \*dumber\* warlock who picks dark pact over ruin. Bravo!
---
You need to be able to hit what you are tanking - I use the middle level + 1 from the atlas loot dungeon level list.
---
If you can afford it, the devilsaur set bonus has some melee hit which is helpful.
---
At 57, start visiting Dire Maul, you want to be able to do a tribute run for that 2hand mace (more readily achievable than Warden Staff, counterweight for faster attack).
---
Or, some people just pvp for the sake of pvp. Like me. I kill someone because I want to kill them.
---
Well if you didnt already do that get an addon that shows incomming heals so you dont heal the same thing as others. Also the addon mighg help you noticed damaged people quicker. Another useful addon is Clique which lets you heal by just hovering over the raid frame essentially saving you one mouse click.
---
And as for who to heal I am not an expert (because things are so easy I wasnt pressured to learn anything), but looking at the heal meters and talking a bit it seems for alliance paladins are the tank healers. And they do tend to overheal more because they stack up crit and healing tanks is more prone to overhealing.
---
In theory you should assign healers to tanks/raid (I remember we had a healer channel for this in tbc/wotlk), but the raids are easy no so unless you are doing crazy speedruns you can do whatever. Here and there a healer is assigned for bosses that are tanked far away from the rest (domo) or like left/right on Ony.
---
Also dont worry too much about the healing meters. They vary wildly on how willing you are to pop consunables just to top the meters and other things out of your control (what is your position on Rag [the place I have on Rag gives me top 5% parses, but on other bosses I just get like 50% no matter what], did you get the gedon bomb, did Ony shoot people close to you or not, how many healers you have in raid. I have seen all healers in my raid top the meters and be last.
---
Yeah, holy paladin. I was never really "assigned" to do anything, so to speak. Pretty much was just trying to use my best judgement, if I saw the tank starting to dip low I'll spam him, then go back to the whack a mole healing. Problem was, there were SO MANY people tanking. I think we had like, 5 or 6 tanks that they kept rotating and so I never could predict who was going to be taking damage. Is this normal? And I was canceling a lot to try and conserve mana rather than waste it on over healing.
---
You can apply that logic to all gaming streams, and it's just plain wrong. Numbers don't lie, people enjoy watching other people play. If you do not that's fair, but claiming that watching streams somehow feeds into a cult personality is just ignorant. There are more streamers out there than Asmongold mate, and I feel like some of them are worth my time/money.
---
I plan to buy the eye of divinity from any guild who is willing to sell. How many gold should I expect to pay for that?
---
They are both right. It's PvP without eHonor and it's pointless to get angry about it.
---
I’m in a similar situation. Instead of perds though I got gut gore ripper. Should I use GGR or MS in offhand? If I should use MS, would GGR be better in PvP? Thanks.
---
Im currently leveling a Destruction Warlock. I know the imp is the go to demon for dungeons, but i was wondering which demon is best for solo questing.
---
I really hate ppl like you. No mage is obliged to give you water or portals, or whatever. If asked nicely I always do it, but just demanding it, just opening trade or giving less than 1g as a tip is just annoying.
---
If the DPS is competent, then a fury warrior wont hold threat from mages and warlocks. Atleast not in current phase with current gear. Also lets not forget the fact that fury warriors use mostly leather/mail gear, some pieces with no stamina on them, and in addition take more damage in zerk stance.
---
I always get resists on novas and get run over by zombies lmao, quite terrifying!
---
which server?
---
I’m pretty sure once a name is flagged for being offensive you are no longer able to use that name on new characters. He instantly made another character with his name.
---
HotW/NS is for sure a build people go so they can continue tanking 5 mans. If you're in a guild I'd speak to your raid leadership about your spec and if they want you in full resto. If you're pugging they can deal with it.
---
Cut your losses. Roll PVE, or quit entirely. Why are you putting yourself through this time wasting misery? Blizzard is not going to "fix it". If it's just the hope of BGs somehow fixing things (which I doubt will happen), the stop playing until they come out? My God, you wasted an entire day.
---
&gt;Don't know how the high level areas are on the server (seering, winterspring, azhara, un'goro etc) but so far on my journey it's definitely Alliance players doing the tryhard stuff
---
And I have the exact opposite experience. The truth is both factions have fuckbois who do this stuff, but you'll of course never notice your own faction doing it since you're not getting killed by them.
---
I knew it... I bet they drink jagerbomb LMAO HAHA 😂😂
---
The way that spirit scales the more spirit you have the more regen per point of spirit you gain. It stacks multiplicatively unlike most other stats in the game. It also directly scales with your mana pool meaning the more mana you have the more valuable spirit becomes.
---
Spot on, got me.
---
Let’s break this down shall we;
---
1. Horde have no incentive to transfer away from their server and leave their guild/ friends.
---
2. Punishing players for picking the most popular Faction on their server is just wrong. So I can’t log on because too many people of my faction are on? So now I’m FORCED to either leave or reroll? No thanks I like to make my own choices thank you!
---
3. Literally complaining is what made retail the Rollercoaster it is today. Every activity is heavily explained so the player can’t get lost doing it. Also all of these baby mechanics like LFR, Group Finder, removal of basically half the abilities in the game are just a few examples.
---
4. Where are you getting this ‘balance of the factions has always been the goal’? This is Classic; a representation of Vanilla WoW. A time when Blizzard let players do what they wanted. Is it unfortunate that some servers have a slight lean one way or the other? Yes, but if it’s really 70/30 then the issue too many HORDE. But let’s be honest it’s not that bad; these numbers are inflated. I think the real issue is more Horde are higher level than Alliance players for whatever reason. 
---
5. And my final thoughts here; nothing will fix this because you can’t punish all Horde players for something they didn’t choose at the start just like how you can punish Alliance players. And yes you can react and group up with your guild to fight them and organize. If you’re guild isn’t about WPvP then they aren’t worth being with on a PvP server IMHO. 
---
PS; Sorry for all the poor Alliance who have to get murdered on their journey to 60, but we all had since August to level up so you were given plenty of time homies! Hopefully after BGs you’ll just post about how OP Horde are in those so see you all again soon!
---
oh see here i thought honour was a currency that gave exclusive access to powerful items like devilsaur. i see now gold buys consumables, enchants, and doodads while honour allows you to buy pvp itemized gear. i'm dumb /concede
---
Good.
---
All horde are scum.
---
Nope
---
The most fun I had in vanilla was 39 twink premade v premade. It was as balanced as the game can get and the people I play with and came to classic for are the same people I twinked with in vanilla.
---
Considering the price of 19 twink gear and how many level 18 rings I sell for a lot of gold, I think twinking will be very popular. 
---
However, the imbalance of the game will carry over into twinking. The trinkets, oh, the fishing hat, etc-those are much more easy to get if you’re the dominant faction. I’m aiming to be competitive at 19 but I’m not going to gear like I did in classic. 
---
I’m also going to make more glass cannons to try various set ups. But I’ll definitely be out there.
---
Here's a tip. Stop playing till a solution that doesnt buttfuck your time comes up.
---
Try goblin land mines on the road from red ridge to elwynn. ;)
---
He did suck but as someone who plays early mornings I can tell you, it’s not that easy. Especially if you’re only offering 2 gold. I’ve had trouble in the past (I start at 5g and went to 10g a couple times) which is why I got my own key. 
---
Even in full guild runs we don’t reserve anything unless everyone agrees to it ahead of times. Ex. We helped our priest farm orbs, they helped me get the gems from lbrs, etc.
---
They already have a great solution. Its called a pve server and its perfect for ppl like you who are blinded by the tunnelvision that the walls of your safespace  creates
---
Nobody claimed that of wrath scaled stronger than +damage. It's just there's more +damage on of wrath items than normally acquired items or there was during real vanilla. On classic with 1.12 itemization there's much more raw spell damage.
---
this man has not done onyxia:
---
that ring is a choice between:
---
* this ring, with 1% spell crit with some fire resist
---
* a necklace with 1 hit and 1 crit with some fire resist
---
* a trinket with 1 dodge +7 defence and some Fire resist.
---
the neck he missed out on is his best-in-slot until phrase 6 NAXX, maybe phrase AQ40
---
GMs are shit
---
Are you a tank???
---
If NO, you dont need FR. 
---
you were probably getting pwned from Wrath of Ragnaros (WoR)unless someone was calling out the “move out” so as not to be in range of it. 
---
WoR hits the melee with the lowest GUID thats in range. The GUID is a number generated based on player creation date. Lower number = older toon. 
---
Were you stacking 2-3 tanks in FR to suck up the hit?
---
With out more specifics its hard to say what else was wrong.
---
I said *one of* the most toxic.  MOBAs are also in there (so is like CoD and its ilk).  Doesn't mean WoW isn't toxic.
---
No.
---
I evaluated my options and thought full health and a couple defensive buffs would net me more steps than immediate mount. I'm pretty sure that is accurate.
---
For example, on one at the end, s priest tried to fear me, but Fear Ward blocked it and I made it quite a bit further than if I had been feared with trinket down.
---
Usually there are either some forms of assigned targets (specifically, tanks) or raid healing, which is pretty much just everything. If there's no coordination whatsoever, even for tanks, then I guess you just heal everything you can. Depending on your positioning on Rag you can have somewhat limited numbers of targets you can heal, but if you're not assigned to the tank specifically, then it should not be your burden to keep him or her up - especially if you're not in range. 
---
&gt;every time I'd see someone take damage I'd go to heal them and before I could even get a flash of light off they'd already be healed to full.
---
Reading the last few lines of your post I assume you're a Pally, in which case you have Flash of Light - if it's anything like in later expansions, it's a fairly mana efficient spell to use and you could snipe the snipers. However, unless you are doing an encounter where you expect high and spiky spot/raid damage, sniping heals with Flash Heal is pretty inefficient and bad praxis that sooner or later will punish the players who adopt that playstyle, when fights become longer and more mana intense. Every single healer in your raid should have HealComm installed so everyone sees the Incoming Heals from all players - if some healers decide that they want to do meter padding and just spam Flash of Light even when not necessary (no life or death matter) then there's little you can do except tell them it's inefficient, and a crappy thing to do if someone is already channeling a heal on the same target. If you are using more than \~8 healers you will probably have less to do, since there is only so much cake to eat and the more people who eat of it, the smaller the slice for everyone. You're also slowing down fights since you could fill those extra spots with DPS instead. 
---
Those packs of flame + earth elementals around Geddon/Shazzrah do some very high damage attacks on ranged players - that attack is a great example of when you actually want to use Flash of Light ASAP, since if the same player gets hit by the next wave of incoming raid damage without being healed up, they are as good as dead.
---
I've been clearing out uldaman, well up to the last door. It's not awful. Gonna try charging for runs with lowbies.
---
I’ll give a brief rundown on how each class plays and roles they can fill:
---
Warrior: Sword and Board, Dual Wielding, Big 2hander. Any way you spell it, Warriors swing sword and swing them well. Tank or DPS. Tough to level, great at max.
---
Paladin: (Alliance Only) Best support in Classic WoW, lots of buffs. Not the strongest tank or DPS,  but they aren’t the worst DPS. Amazing healers.
---
Shamans: (Horde Only) Horde side support, few of the coolest spells in the game, totems for every situation. Heal or DPS
---
Rogues: Sneak around, stun and dismember fools dual wielding weapons. If you like to attack fast this is the class for you. DPS
---
Priests: Amazing Healers, can definitely melt faces with their DoT based Shadow build. DPS or Heal
---
Druids: Jack of all trades, master of none. Shapeshifters. All Roles. 
---
Hunter: Bow and Pet, amazingly easy to play alone. Traps are great utility as well. DPS.
---
Mage: if you like to explode things and control the battlefield, these guys do it best. DPS
---
Warlock:  More survivable and have more utility than Mages. Big hits vs Damage over time. Amazing group utility. DPS.
---
clearly you should write a "PvP for dummies" to educate the mentally flawed masses so they start enjoying the faction imbalances as they should
---
Details, only shows the talents of others who have it.
---
Again, *one of*.  Not *the most*.  Multiple communities can be considered toxic you know, it's not mutually exclusive.
---
They really don't ban anyone for anything aside from blatant botting. Even RWT ban typically don't last more than a couple of months to a year. 15 year old me was a dipshit and the worst I ever got was a 3 day mute, but could still use guildchat/bnet chat.
---
Probably because horde dominate all pvp servers with pure numbers, besides the refugee server. And even thats changing.
---
Mousebind fishing to mouse4/5 and turn everything to 0 except for game sounds. Then zoom in on your fishable zone. Watched many episodes of ST:Voyager while levelling it.
---
And I already stated that I thought this was Darkshore.
---
I think you might be the problem. I never had a problem like this gathering my entire preraid BiS.
---
First of all a healer should rarely need a manabreak and secondly you can just start drinking right away and keep drinking while the rest is in combat and get up only a few seconds in when the tank needs a heal.
---
Lol downvoted to oblivion
---
Hm? It's a quest reward, where the neck you can take instead is Warrior BiS.
---
Yes tell me of the extremely niche situation of MCing someone requiring engineering in the first place, how it doesnt backfire, hoping it's a 1v1, hoping it doesnt break early, and doing all that when u can just fear combo
---
Yeah, that was amusing.  "Classic will bring the community back!" and yet people are bringing retail or private server mindsets to classic and polluting it.
---
Turns out that the real magic of vanilla WoW was not knowing everything and figuring it out yourself.
---
Nothing wrong with content creators getting favoured by the company that they directly contribute to by keeping the game popular.
---
You don't really need to avoid it that much. It's only considered safespotting if you're in a spot where you would normally be attacked by a guard.
---
"parties"
---
I see. But the problem is still present for Horde players terrorised by the alliance. Leveling is a nightmare.
---
oh so you were wrong twice in a row then.
---
Nope, there was no Brazilian server at the beginning. Unfortunately they came to the server that I picked, thalnos NAE-PvP. On top of that I picked alliance and it’s 30/70 in favor of horde. Needless to say I quit at level 52.
---
Fuck dps. Tank and healer determine speed of run.
---
I mean if you are 60 you should absolutely have something by now to use in place of a Carrot lol
---
Take a screenshot instead?
---
You guys are beyond evil
---
Druid is max lvl with pre bis tanking and some post bis resto. Been slowly doing professions for him but too broke to just buy all the materials. Because grinding engi/mining is too boring, I started leveling a mage. He’s 33 right now and I try to focus on some grinding in dungeons just to mix it up. I really want a mage as a farming toon. Still have my abandonded lock which was my first toon at lvl 43. I’ll get back to him eventually.
---
Yep I get that and I like it.  Like I said farming bots keep black lotus reasonable, I thank them for it.
---
Not at all. My post is about my experience with my brother on the weekends.
---
I bought this set for my 60 hunter. Its sooo shiny!
---
Is there additional data to be found for paladin downrank healing with +healing gear?  There is a calculator at [wowdownrank.com](https://wowdownrank.com) but was hoping to find another source or two to compare against.
---
on firemaw eu chat dies every evening
---
Everyone has better gear and talents.
---
Healers in pre raid bis have like +400-500 healing. You just heal through that extra fire damage. In vanilla it was +0.
---
The raid having way higher DPS means fights are shorter and easier on healers mana. Healers have the mana to spare to make up for that extra damage taken.
---
In your understanding, what is "honor decay" and how do you get it?
---
&gt; Whenever it doesn’t seem to work anymore. Most people will be against it from the start, some more open minded people will be fine with it till mid 40s probably. In vanilla, me as a shadow priest, a Druid, and a shaman 3 manned most dungeons from 40s through DM east. Shaman was main tank, Druid would heal until low mana and then start tanking and someone else would heal.
---
Wish people were more opened to the idea. Just main tanked the entirety of Molten Core. Absolutely no reason to push away a shaman tank for high-end dungeons at the very least. According to the guide on https://barrens.chat/ it seems to work perfectly t'ill Naxx, so yeah it "works" :)
---
Damn son, you completely missed his point.
---
Damn i was complaining about my couple mage raegents but thats another level
---
Attacking the warlock does break CCs on your pet like blind. Only thing thats worth is maybe a banish on the pet because soul link is turned off for the duration but if the warlock is soul link and has 5 pieces of t1 its just not worth it, you will get so many resists you will start losing hair
---
latest census showed pop at 50:50 on the dot lol
---
Welcome to Hydraxian Waterlords! Wisper me @Rengaru if you need a buddy to group up with (tank in learning!)
---
Your second statement is spot on, we know better now. And 15 years of experience on the fight and the hear/talent set we have now make a big difference. 
---
My first rag kill was a slog and lasted +7min (in vanilla).
---
My slowest classic kill was 4min 45sec. It took us 40 sec to gather up and kill all the sons of flame for my guilds first week. We have not had a P2 since that week.
---
Jump from the building next to it. Very easy to kill any number of hordes up there, if you've got sappers and some guildies.
---
&gt; The #nochanges was always dumb.
---
Yup... there are so many features that should have come with classic to improve the game without substantially changing the game, also, just because vanilla had a timeline of content release doesn't mean that timeline was optimal. Releasing honor without BGs was obviously going to be a terrible mistake. Day 1 it was clear that it was in fact a mistake. Releasing BGs early will help but they should have been ready to pull this trigger on day 2 after the honor release since it is such an easy thing to anticipate.
---
Another issue on most servers is people abusing boat rezzes to farm honor. It would be an easy change if they ported horde on alliance boats to a far away graveyard instead of rezzing them on a boat for example.
---
Back in the day it wasn't as common to have horde doing this, now it is the standard honor farming strategy. Horde will sit on the harbor boat literally all day long.
---
But... even with all the problems that come with their adherence to #nochanges, I do understand it. It can be easy to get carried away with new features and corrections to old problems. Blizzard doesn't know how many people want are after what and if you start changing things with too much frequency, who is going to be pissed off about it and who isn't? There's really no way to tell.
---
Personally, I feel a lot of players want to play classic with features that came out in BC / Wrath to help alleviate a lot of the major issues, but you can't really base all your decisions on players like me without alienating a lot of others.
---
The trick is the content is easy and you can start drinking and you keep drinking if you dont take damage even if you get in combat.
---
So I have 0% mana, I throw renew on tank. He pulls instantly and by the time he needs a heal I have a lot of mana anyway.
---
If it isn’t worth it casting shadowbolts, how are you getting full duration DoTs?  I’ve thought that trash is just shadowbolt or RoF/hellfire.
---
Based on what I've seen on our realm and read on here, this seems pretty much on spot. The respawn timer appears to be very, very random.
---
It's not an Alliance only issue. It's a problem on any server where you aren't the dominant faction. Good luck leveling as Horde on Heartseeker. Going from Org to UC unflagged won't stop you from getting your ass destroyed as soon as you try to make it past lvl 30 through questing.
---
Are you looking to maximize healing/mana, with illumination taken into account?
---
When I tank dungeons and some warlock does this to me he gets promoted to be the tank. I don't even care anymore at this point. I've tried reasoning with them and asking them not to go all nuts before I've even touched the mobs (except for that 1 arrow I shot that did a whopping 30 damage to 1 mob in the pack of 3 which was pulled), but on some people there's just no hope. 
---
As a healer you should do the same in my opinion - just stop healing them.
---
Is anyone here using shadowpanther.net with the ability equivilancy points for their calculations? I would use that as it's pretty straightforward.
---
So much this
---
Does anyone know if you will be able to gather herbs in Alterac Valley? I Know it was possible on privateservers.
---
when bgs open on the 10th,most of this bullshit will be gone
---
to be fair rogues are doing this in every server
---
Wow you sure showed those alliance
---
Time to get a horde tattoo eh
---
yeah the true adults are the ones who spend 12 hours a day circlejerking in brm spamming aoes for those precious 15 honor points
---
definitely not jobless manchildren
---
Wrong.
---
To avoid competition I guess?
---
Perfect because I missed it last time
---
the only way to get pvp ranks and gear is to kill players in the wild
---
bgs are coming in a few days,and 99% of honor farmers will move there
---
Is pally mount not free? I just rolled one and I was under the impression it was free. Didn’t bother to google
---
It was discussed many times back in the day though. The main drawback for 'dishonourable target' is that said target can be used strategically. He can stand in the way of AoE, or even jump into an enemy's AoE.
---
I did the delete/restore and it worked, like maybe 3-4 weeks ago maybe been patched since then
---
That was your experience, on Fearilina I in constant fights with people too. I grouped with fandoms just to have backup with 30 seconds. If someone died we ran to the location and started a brawl. Not to brag but we usually won and moved on. Gnomes were always kill on sight lol!
---
The issue here is that people think STV is the only way to go. Get questie and find other places to level. Idk what zones Alliance have for 30-35 35-40 but I’m sure you have something lol.
---
Lol you dont even need pots.. ive done 4 MC runs since hitting 60 in 40-50s quest items gear and ive not died to Ragnaros... the most ive lost is maybe 40-50% hp in 1 hit from that fire attack.
---
16 open slots? thats alot of free real estate
---
Zandalar Tribe, joined at launch and enjoying ever since.
---
I see equal amounts of horde and alliance in most places.
---
Yea, it's difficult to prove unless you have a laggy realm, take out the proposed lag-inducer (Honor Spy) and check if there is a difference. Then repeat on other similar realms to confirm. 
---
If the data transmission / cross referencing is as heavy as some posts make it sound, it would only make sense that a larger player population (using it) would exacerbate the problem. Playing on a medium/high pop realm on EU, and haven't really had any major issues there - so it might be a question about traffic. If enough / too many people use it, the lag kicks in - whereas on smaller realms, it might not get as bad. This is just hypothetical, of course.
---
So basically every community is toxic? :&gt;
---
Sounds like you should play a different build. If you want to stick with the Rogue, I'd suggest daggers. Especially Seal Fate Daggers. It is a much more involved playstyle then swords.
---
Courtyard is not inside the instance , it's outside. So what you would do is enter through the side enterance (before the courtyard) , get naked , die , run to the instance you wanted to do in the first place and rez there.
---
Imo I wouldn't rely too heavily on that. Onyxia worked in a similar way and it got fixed. I'd expect this one to get fixed as well before too long.
---
I mean, I pretty much stopped playing my Shaman on Heartseeker because any time tried to do anything outside Org/UC I just got instafukt by 10 keyboard turning Gnomes and Night Elves. I only raid log on my Shaman because it's the only time I can actually play the game.
---
I'm having fun leveling my Night Elf Druid on Pagle now.
---
Only the level 40 mount is free, the other mount is still only like 300-500g depending on servers, but not free.
---
Hey man! I’m at the same point where you are. I’m freshly dinged 60, with some BiS pre-raid items on my tank. In a couple of days I will have my second kid and Classic will be a memory gone for at least 6-12 months.
---
The goblin NPCs tell you where it goes.
---
Must be server-based because I haven't noticed any issues on Incendius, perhaps like a 1 sec delay but that doesn't seem to out of the ordinary.
---
Isnt the chance (supposedly) twice as high on ooze veins? I have noticed, that there are periods where nothing will drop from them. It seems to come in clusters like, theres a maximum amount of stuff that can drop in sillithus per unit of time and afterwards you wont get anything until it resets again.
---
I do it on off-peaks and i can usually pick a vein every 5 minutes.
---
So you have another item that needs to drop, one that does fire damage which won’t help in MC, and one that requires a raid group that no one is doing anymore.
---
And not in MC
---
Well it's like 3 hour progress in raid lost with one kill
---
Maybe you are fighting too high lvl mobs?
---
Just enter through DM East side entrance.
---
Have you tried playing a tank before?
---
I know it's not always a big issue as a healer, but as a tank these guys are preventing you from doing your job - which is actually tanking mobs. I used to find it really frustrating to tank dungeons because of said people, and in the end I think this is what made me go from being a tank warrior to being a damage warrior. And that's really sad, cause I know this has happened/is happening to many other tanks as well which is just incressing the problem of never having any tanks om a server.
---
15 years later and some people still don't just try talking to the goblins that tell you exactly where each one goes
---
RareAware
---
and theirs, which is the whole point.
---
you lose like 20 seconds at most, and if you have a respawn timer you lose essentially no time.
---
Every community has its dickbags, yes. But WoW seems to have a good number of them.
---
&gt; Man just buy a better trinket or go get a quest one, or farm a high drop rate one. Almost anything is better than carrot witch might as well be nothing. You could buy like blazing emblem, smoking heart of the mountain, counterattack lodestone (from a hunter selling tribute loot), lifestone, and a few others. Never mind all the ones you can get from quests/ farming. There is no reason to have carrot imo. Hell I had better trinkets before I even hit level 59 when I entered my first raid (I gad eye of the beast and then mark of resolution/ankh of life)
---
It has stamina and Fire resist, i don't see the issue.
---
But that is my point. It is a 50% drop item that you only compete with your class to get.
---
Also not true, as one of the first members of the mafia there we’re more players in there not from newgen than were, people like you are just sheep and believe everything they’re told.
---
Most instance runs are for prebis gearing at lvl 60. I was assuming you were helping fresher guildies to get geared up, my bad.
---
From my experience every other online game is worse.
---
It also makes it easier to buy since it has a good chance to drop and many guilds don't need it anymore.
---
Main is a 60 mage, i have a 54 druid and a 35 rogue aswell.
---
and a week later realize that BGfarmers made a million while they made 100k
---
Found the camping horde player
---
The same window yeah, it resets the first packs and by jumping around and over you dont have to open(close?) the door to west garrison
---
Haha, I "healed" in a PUG naxx 25 as a gnome rogue, was when ToC was out so was easy content still. Wrote as a troll and got inv, and was in entire raid haha, brought bags full of bandages haha
---
I am looking for the macro syntax to *toggle* pet abilities on and off - for instance, to dump a full focus bar on Claw, or to spam Growl on a mob which has aggro'd a clothie in a dungeon.
---
What I have found is " /petautocastoff \[ability\] " but I am looking for a toggle, not only on or off.
---
The video he linked literally says it.
---
A few things to keep in mind;
---
- Maul is your main ability as it generates a lot more threat than your other abilities. When you tank a pack, make sure you Tab - Maul every mob at least once to prevent the healer from pulling aggro.
---
- Swipe is also great for tanking packs, although it generates less threat than Maul. If you use Swipe, make sure you Tab - Swipe to spread your threat among the pack nicely.
---
- A lot of Warriors will tell you to spam Demoralizing Roar, but I would advice against that. I think the Warrior ability Demoralizing Shout has a lot higher threat output (idk, don’t play it myself) but as a druid you generate a lot more threat using Maul or Swipe. Casting it once at the start of a fight helps to reduce damage, especially against packs.
---
- Use Enrage before a fight, not during the fight (unless you run out of rage). The debuff runs out quickly so you can start the fight when you actually have the rage without the disadvantage.
---
- Don’t be afraid to pop out of bear form during the fight to cast Innervate on your healer. He will be happy to let you take a big hit or two if it means he gets half his mana bar back!
---
Enjoy tanking! It’s a lot more fun than dpsing in dungeons in my opinion so you made a good decision!
---
Get pre bis.
---
If plateclasses are to gain gold from this, they need to be able to pay their repair fees and still have a positive income. I normally let the demand for boosting pump the prices up naturally.
---
Windseeker is doing well. Lots of raid groups and almost nightly PVP at Southshore you can partake in.
---
How exactly does spell check batching work?
---
I'm playing a Shaman and spell batching makes it so chain lightning followed immediately by a shock spell will both gain the benefits of elemental mastery. I assume this has to do with both spells more or less casting and connecting simultaneously - in the same batch. This being the case, why doesn't the same work for clearcasting? Unlike elemental mastery, which always fully discounts both spells and reduces both mana costs, only the chain lightning will be discounted by clearcasting.
---
You probably neverr seen how druid carry 5 sets: bear, cat, heal, arcane dps and fire resist.
---
How would you know it didn't work?
---
&gt; are simply victims of revenge gank squads.
---
I guess you can thank your faction for that.
---
I used to have sympathy and leave people minding their own business, but horde players have proven themselves to be bottom of the barrel fucking scum.
---
I no longer have an ounce of sympathy.
---
Thanks!
---
Or rotations and shifts to control locations? Having played Eve/ Rust I’ve always worked around having people online watching over bases and locations. 
---
Don’t you guys have the king of neckbeards on your factions? Sir Asmongold of the Basement!
---
Spells below level 20 have a penalty, so if the required level to learn a spell is level 20 or higher, they follow the normal coefficient scaling.
---
&gt;2 . A lot of people think it is impossible. They have prob. seen a bad prot pally tank once or never seen one.
---
I play as a shaman Raid tank 
---
and I couldn't agree more. There's so many naysayers out there who make judgements just because it doesn't fit the glorious status of warriors/druids.
---
I dont get it,the rogue killed you and then got crushed
---
whats the problem here? the rogue is donating free kills to people in your town
---
Might have been shadow spec with no access to holy nova. I healed live strat twice late 50s as shadow and yes each pull had cc and was a race til I oom’ed
---
I guess so.
---
That was never what was said at all. 
---
&gt;Screw no changes, the boats need 55 elite guards like the zeps get.
---
The zeps have 55 elite guards outside it. The boats do not. 
---
You are so wrong and continue to dig yourself deeper because you think you are somehow smarter than everyone because of semantics.
---
Arena Grand Master from Guru(STV)
---
What in the world
---
glad to see this is the same on every server it appears... thank god for my ultrasafe teleporter gadgetzan.
---
My impression is that people care very little as long as someone is still worth any honor at all.
---
I only take my raid gear out of the bank once a week. And I have my shadow/frost reflector ect. About 5 trinks total, 20ish hand grenades and a few potions you have lots of space left over like 25 slots at least
---
Or just get a cat. Better for literally everything.
---
How do you even manage to quote someone and not pull the whole thing? You quote "Does it say ON the boat? No, it says they need guards LIKE the zep." when the whole quote is
---
&gt;Screw no changes, the boats need **55 elite** guards like the zeps get.
---
Like, talk about arguing in bad faith jesus dude get over yourself.
---
2019; not copy and pasting this old ass macro.
---
That's actually a great idea! I never tried it because I don't have good daggers and I've read it's only worthwhile doing it with &gt;30% crit. But who cares about efficiency if the content is on farm...
---
The Holy Shock build (assuming you'r well geared) can also be used as a budget taunt for tanking.
---
I'm so glad I play a stealth class &gt;,&lt;.  I don't have to live with all the pain.
---
Don't have any sources, but i checked it out myself. All spells ranks learned from lvl 20 and below has a lower spell power coefficient. I think it amounts to about 50-60 % lower healing/damage. I checked it with renew ranks, where rank 1 and 2 does a lot lower healing.
---
I played a support character (Gloomhaven, not WoW) for the first time, and I was bemused by how often my team was like "Technichara can you play that card again?" even though they know perfectly well cards go in the discard once used. Or they want me to do two top actions in the same turn.
---
you don't have any utility if you are dead (which you will be with no sac)
---
Die in DM:E, and then run into DM:N.
---
Work, wow, sleep, rinse and repeat
---
rank 4 after two weeks is middle ground, you maybe could have made rank 5, but rank 6 is only for top pvpers.
---
Cannibalize is the ultimate tilter, it's quite brilliant.
---
Never has anyone but YOU mentioned guards being on the modes of transport. 
---
Zeppelins have 55 guards in front of them, boats should get the same. Youve twisted it to fit your mentality, stupid as it may be.
---
we understood mechanics in vanilla,but there was no chat,beside a few dude on irc,now you have discord and both factions on there,its super easy to talk to anyone,you talk like people who played vanilla were cavemen,we knew everything about the game then,the info just wasnt so easy to find like now
---
i am thinking about leveling a rogue next and one thing that has put me off is knowing i need to get HOJ.
---
how hard is it to solo? do you need to have really good gear or is pre bis good enough?
---
Thanks, much appreciated
---
&gt; Did a lot of tanking as a paladin on pservers as a pally and been doing a bit of tanking as a shammy and a lot as warrior on classic. The only time ilI had a good opinion of deathbone os when i was first starting my pally tanking endeavors but the more i played the more i noticed its just a bad set, you end up with too little HP in exhcange for high ammount of defense, the thing is that defense is almost completely useless in 5/10mans and even more so in classic than on private servers.
---
There's a really good guide that goes over *shaman raid tanking* highly suggest to look it over https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1150
---
A transporter of gods!
---
*the GOLDEN GODS*
---
How does lag affect hovering and clicking on items?
---
That’s an addon
---
Only if enough alliance players go, lol
---
Well I was wondering about a name change for myself and I brought him up. It wasn’t directly for his cause.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;\#NoChanges
---
&gt;&gt;
---
&gt;&gt;These complaints are a RESULT of changes: elevated population caps.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;- you think populations on servers are higher in classic then vanilla?
---
Yes. They objectively are. This isn't an opinion.
---
&gt;- you think this is worse than what vanilla was like?
---
That's juste wrong. There's many games where you can watch someone way above your skill play and learn things for yourself like shooters or RTS games. Can't see any reason why you would watch someone play WoW though.
---
&gt;  avoiding death squads adds another layer.
---
You're clearly on a relatively balanced server, there is no "avoiding" the death squads on a very lopsided server unless you're a class that can stealth.
---
There are like the Mindless zombies of the scourge Invasion, except controlled by players.
---
In Durotar:  
---
South = Undercity  
---
North = STV
---
In Tirisfal Glades:  
---
West = Orgrimmar  
---
East = STV
---
How much of a pothead do you have to be to not remember shit like that after one and a half decade
---
I sure will mate!!
---
I feel sorry for people that didn't transfer when they had the chance.
---
Screen..what? Are you a nerd?
---
Except he's not. He's stated multiple times and shown proof that it's fucking easy as shit to find a huge streamer's location on a streamer server by just asking or having intel networks. No steam sniping necessary.
---
Any way I as a heal can say that it is fine. I'm honestly cool as long as you keep aggro on 1-2 mobs in a fight and the bosses.
---
I have so much healing power and mana, I could do most of the dungeon without any tanks.
---
A lot of bosses and mobs function differently, like missing entire mechanics, for example in MC one was fixed recently because it got noticed by a lot of people. the biggest one of all though, is basing Classic on 1.12, which contains TONS of changes that changed entire dynamics of the game, including making MC easy af like it is now.
---
if you dont like arena it was the golden age of pvp
---
if you like arena then tbc of course
---
wotlk was ok but it started the devolving of the game
---
It's funny that we think they out number them when theres 1 or 2 pugs around and you can clearly see 5 people in my party with 1 of them being in EPL and 12+ people on spy.
---
That's the coolest way to ding to 60 I've seen so far. :D
---
200 IQ plays
---
&gt; only if it abides by your strict rules and is balanced and fair 
---
Yup. You got it. 
---
My opinion on what wPvP should be is at least just as legitimate as yours, and you don't get to pontificate on what the definition of wPvP is. 
---
And judging from the current player reaction on PvP imbalance, looks like I'm not alone in thinking the system is broken garbage.
---
I do the same thing, it's usually because I forgot water but always have cloth for bandages
---
I love pvp, I literally only play this game because of wpvp and bg’s . But when you get so salty you gotta go on your 60 just to revenge your self is lame. No skill involved at all.
---
Shadowcraft is one of the only tier0 sets that is actually good because of the 6/8 bonus. You do actually see a lot of rogues going for 6/8 shadowcraft and 2/2 devilsaur nowadays.
---
The other tier0 sets not so much.
---
I tried it a couple weeks ago. I had around 27% crit. Lost my Ony buff of course. 
---
I did reasonably well and it was a hell of a lot more fun than even Combat Daggers, which I find even that to be more fun than swords.
---
As if people care that you're honorless.
---
If they do, they'll just sap/sheep you and then kill you.
---
This isnt about pvp. No one is enjoying the current state of wpvp. Its about honor rewards. The game is minmaxed to shit and someone elses tryharding doesn’t factor in your good time.
---
There are different types of depression.
---
No problem to heal a lock that steadily life taps throughout the fight. The problem is locks who lifetaps to 5% health between pills and makes no effort whatsoever to eat or bandage up. That, or locks who just lifetaps everything in one go in combat taking them to like 10% health with damage flying all around. So many locks just don't take any responsibility for their own health management
---
Watch Blizzard act instantly to fix this.

Point to me on this list of wetlands NPCs where the 55 elite guards are
---
yeah not once in my 12 years of playing this game have i heard of anyone doing that until now
---
i have shifts at my job, not on a video game
---
While not quite BiS I'm close enough that the sight upgrade I would get from running strat UD for the 40th time to try and get that neck just doesn't appeal anymore. Haven't started an alt only because of how fucked stalagg is but I'm pretty much raid logging at this point.
---
He wasn't even sniping, people act like it's hard to find a streamer on a streamer server. All you have to do is ask in chat and you will find him in two mins.
---
what about j c Ÿ c € c
---
So many people making excuses in this thread. We can have daily spy threads until blizzard moves their ass but yeah/ lets not come tgether on issues like this. Debate petty shit. This community is awful.
---
Dude I literally only play this game for the pvp, I just think it’s such a coward move to, leave off your alt after getting killed and going on your 60 main to kill the guy who killed you.
---
Good. It discourages mass aoe spam in pvp which is a good thing.
---
In some situations i guess it could be ok, maybe if you're a mage you can rocket helm the pet and get a full sheep on the lock without worrying it gets devoured or silenced. Other than that i think you'd prolly have more success rocket helming the lock and killing the pet if youre a melee
---
thanks. i'll check it out.
---
how? they are literary just farming honor to gain ranks
---
if you can kill people solo,its more honor then grouping up
---
its not blizzards fault alliance are pussies and 10 of them barely kill one rogue before he vanish
---
Idk, but if I go a month without getting loot I’m probably gone. I mean I get it, but from my point of view, every week I don’t get anything by default is a wasted lockout. Cuz I could be doing pugs every week where loot is rolled off and actually getting gear.
---
I am fighting same or 1 lvl higher mobs
---
and 20 manual crowd pummelers
---
Nope, not really. Tanking is divided into two categories with each class excelling at different categories.
---
At their base without buffs/gear/skill to help their raid cons:
---
- Paladin excel at defensive aspects but less on threat.
---
- Shaman excel at threat but less on defensive aspects.
---
- Warrior and druid are similar with warriors being able to save the day if something happens and druids requiring a more experienced group.
---
sick auto attacks bro
---
Warrior pug tanks? Our MT is exactly the same!
---
I see a kitty, but I don't see a hand petting it! The poor, neglected, thing! :(
---
Arathi highlands, which is full of undead. Just checked to see how the server was doing and it seems pretty dead. Asked how the PvP was. Only answer i got "still not fun".
---
You missed out the 5-10 talents.
---
But given you recommend Last Stand, that means 2 points in Imp Bloodrage.
---
The last 3 points can go into either more armor, or more stun resist. These points are too important IMO. Personally I put them into stun resist since I'm an orc, giving me around a 33% chance to resist stuns overall.
---
I'm using 31/5/15 at the moment. I like it a lot, much more than 9/31/11.
---
Yeah like I said, classic/vanilla is great but what you're saying here is really not the opinion of the majority. Personally I've always found classic pvp to be a pile of shit with almost no redeeming qualities. But that's also not a popular opinion.
---
If you ask most people theyll point to tbc, wotlk or mop as the golden era. Depends on the person and their pve or pvp interest.
---
Going to get downvoted into oblivion but aren’t they just getting the fire resist buff from UBRS before going to Ragnaros? My alliance guild does this every week on a horde dominated server and it’s actually pretty fun - 30 people need to hold the terrace for 20 minutes or so. One of the best parts about vanilla for me so far and the best part of world PVP with actual stakes, rewards and risk. 
---
I understand it’s not fun on the receiving end if your server is outnumbered 10:1 or if they are doing it for shits and giggles to fuck with people, I’m just giving you another perspective on what might be happening here.
---
Well Majordomo has thousands of HP and gets one shot by rag. So there's no way to survive to rag. 
---
BY FIRE BE PURGED
---
how do you manage with only 5 trinkets? I have about 20 I frequently use and a few rarely used
---
So we're not gonna talk about the haircut?
---
Have you completed qusts for wand, healing ring and water elemental killing?
---
Not sure what's more lame, your name or the video.
---
To someone who sees you log off, they are the same.
---
I feel you (whoevers pain).
---
Back in Vanilla, I couldn't get anything good to drop for a long time, so I wore  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16729/lightforge-spaulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16729/lightforge-spaulders)  on my orc warrior.  
---
In fact, so long, people joked "that orc paladin" more often than not xD
---
We have 500+ players on Earthshaker EU on normal hour spawns.
---
It's so crowded that servers take a dump.
---
My ElvUI now shows all target buffs after the recent update.
---
ahahah xD That's right man:D
---
This is why i always put it in quotes when i talk about the "honor" system. I swear, this is some of the most1984-level alternative definition of words i've ever seen.
---
The cooldowns above the target could be Neatplates. I’m having a lot of trouble with that addon right now
---
I don't understand why people are standing in the cities flagged for pvp, and then complain about getting killed
---
Sure, WotF is OP as hell, but at the end of the day, you're still playing lock. Lol
---
I got sick of healing and wanted to do something else. Decided if i was going to reroll i wanted to do it differently, so i rolled my first ever ally toon to level. Level 33 so far and loving it.
---
3 % according to wowhead and seems about right from my experience. The clusters are just RNG. 3 % is not much and variance is a bitch.
---
Thank you - you and several others in this thread have educated me on this, I'm gonna research and be sure to use it in the future :)
---
What effect does classic have on private servers? Are they dead?
---
When you are 55 ish you should start farming for your robes of the void. It's a bop 300 tailoring lock chest that is bis for a long time. You need to farm Demonic Runes since they are bop. The best place I found to get these was from satyrs in felwood. These satyrs also drop felcloth which you need 40 of to make the robes. The satyrs also drop runecloth which can help get your tailoring high enough without breaking the bank. Also the satyrs xp isn't bad and they can be farmed quite efficiently once you separate the groups spawn times. The other pieces of felcloth tailoring gear are also really good and I would recommend farming for them as well (hood and pants) these will be replaced by level 58+ dungeons but they will increase your damage by a lot  for realtively cheap and make dungeon grinds better.
---
That is where we will end up if it continues - not having any tanks left because dps are not punished for being jerks in dungeons :)
---
haha I love tanks like that :D
---
thats when you proceed to do all trash up to boss and by then the tank will be so god damn mad :D
---
Upper part of the chart shows pvp server
---
Lower part of the chart shows pve servers
---
Straight up.
---
Ah, running MC while the THICC POWERFUL alliance downs Ony on reset night. Yep, sounds like the cowardly Heartseeker horde alright.
---
Because not only do I not like half the races available to alliance, I genuinely think they are super lame. Icing on the cake ka they also don't have shamans.
---
So its not so much loyalty to horde as it is complete apathy for the alliance as a whole. So generic and dorky.
---
Yep it must only be a thing on one-sided servers, where horde is so desperate for any "pvp" that they resort to this.
---
We often have big brawls in and around gadgetzan, including FP camping whenever either faction ends up with more players, and gray levels usually just pass through harmless.
---
Yeah, you like feeling up little buddies, don't you, you shit
---
Eh, there are many roofs in Ogrimmar that are are like this - safe from guards, like the roof of the Ah...
---
I mean, either you don't know what the word context means or you're using it incorrectly?  
---
I'm calling you deranged in the context of this thread, which is also where I posted.   
---
People aren't having fun, you are, great! But the fact you need to come onto reddit for posting the "eat shit pathetic babies" line is... Extremely telling... I reckon you're either a troll or really clueless about these kind of social interactions, either way, you still come across as, well, deranged. Hope you have fun in the thread, my dude, and catch you around.
---
8 days until BGs. Hang in there.
---
whew now that you got that out hopefully you've logged in/out and rezzed.
---
Our guild needs desert resto and more enh shamans
---
The real question is why the are you going in the front door and not side? So much extra trash for nothing
---
Camping level 40s is not farming honor.
---
Seconded, balance seems good. Levelling is a bit of a shitshow right now, but hopefully it will sort itself out once BGs go live.
---
world pvp will die like it did in vanilla, don't worry  
---
there will always be gankers, but brm and its surroundings won't feel like a gaybar
---
i will do my best.
---
Please just go play PVE.
---
This is what makes PVP servers fun.
---
Stop complaining as if it's no intended.
---
That was my first thought too. Looks like they’re just getting fire resist buff to me. Pretty common.
---
5 min of not being active in PVP within a city will unflag you. As a lock I know the pain of dagger rogues but just laugh it off and wait a min or so to unflag in IF.
---
We got 5 Rogues in our Raid and only one of them cares for Daggers (he already got Perd + CHT) all the other Rogues want swords so getting brutality blade will be a pain  because i spent all my DKP on VIS'KAG.. that's why i'm going to use PERD for Off Hand.
---
 [https://puu.sh/EKXlr/6719c5fb8b.jpg](https://puu.sh/EKXlr/6719c5fb8b.jpg)
---
How did you get them to flag in starting areas?
---
Ah they kill me anyways under the guise of the "RP event" they've been running since last Wednesday where the entirety of the horde population is camping all the major lvl 50+ quest hubs.
---
I don't know if you're being dense on purpose or if you're actually dumb, but no one is defending the lock who taps to 10 health after combat and then waits to get healed up.
---
Warlocks need to tap during fights.
---
You're being downvoted but you're right. Everyone upvoting this thread either doesn't understand what collusion is or didn't watch the video. This is just a guy with issues spazzing out. 
---
Not any different from premades dodging each other.
---
Is the spawn timer different from Vanilla?
---
sure bud.
---
I have both pairs of rocket boots, wearing gnomish atm and goblin in the bag - when they're on cd I switch
---
the tailoring stuff takes up small space compared to the hazzle of going to a major city every time I want to craft something
---
I have both rocket and mind control helmets, you an use mc cap after vw sac you just need to start casting another demon summon and immediatly cancel so your pet really despawns
---
and what does deathcoil have to do with any of this? most trinkets have over 10min cd so I use another one in the meantime and not a single one of them does anything related to deathcoil
---
It was early in the morning when not many are on.
---
PvP happened on a PvP server.
---
Quickly let us tell reddit.
---
Nope. Never have I heard of people more afraid of confrontation than the Alliance. Even on the Alliance dominated servers Horde rarely complain. We move on and fight back. 
---
So you sit around complaining all day, or do something that matters!
---
https://youtu.be/dAxZVZgpmI0
---
&gt;Dare to imagine a world where people respected each other and sought to face their opponents on even footing.
---
That sounds awful. Playing on PvP server is just more exciting, as you have the suspense of potentially being attacked at any moment. And you can also find a hostile and not attack them, and then pretend to be friendly until they are in a bad situation.
---
Vanilla without world pvp just isn't the same, and I would never play without it.
---
People who think that have mental health issues.
---
oof I hope you're not getting wrecked by 5th graders as an adult.
---
Good to know. I must be confused with the diminishing returns honor (still says estimated the full amount)
---
The last comment is pure projection. Ouch. He feels that way about himself.
---
I like in the sewers actually For The Forsaken!!!
---
Go back to your City where you hide! 
---
*Cue Undead Laugh*
---
I generally prefer PvP and will probably go Horde. I've heard PvP servers are chaos atm though.
---
Wtf are you taking about? Unless you're shadow spec you're going to be using smite to kill shit. Unless you like wanding shit for 5 minutes instead of casting your only non CD direct damage.
---
Lol it looks exactly like mine !
---
No, it was replaced with an EULA years ago.
---
I scrolled up and now I’m dying 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Yeah, it will be so fun for horde when they won't find ANY Alliance in the world after a few months. (because let's be real, BGs are unlikely to stabilize this mess)
---
Dagger rogue pvp question.
---
Im really struggling on understanding what are good daggers for pvp. A main hand is kinda obvious. Take the one with the biggest end dmg for your ambush and backstabs (atm i got a barman shanker with +5). But in the offhand. What are you looking for ? I got a few options i want to ask about. I can use :   
---
Scarlet Kris 43-81 dps / 1.5 speed / 10 agi 10 stam / crusader ench.
---
Distracting dagger 42-64 dps / 1.3 speed / +6 daggers / crusader ench.  
---
Is the +6 daggers better than the good stats on the scarlet kris ?  
---
And with AV i will take the Lobotomizer as main hand. But than there is another offhand availeble.  
---
Glacial Blade 53-100 / 1.8 speed / 10 agi /  Chance on hit: [Blasts a target for 45 Frost damage.](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18398) / crusader ench.  
---
I dont raid. Maybe i could get some MC daggers, than i will ofc go for Perd and CHT. But for now thats not a option. Can someone please enlighten me whats good and why ?
---
11 hours is for the roll/loot distribution
---
There's no tips or tricks.  
---
You either take hybrid build and be mediocre at everything, or take full tank\heal and forget about other role.  
---
HotW/NS is viable for tanking dungeons and solo farming. But in raids you will be at the bottom of healing meters, and other healers will start to ask questions about your performance.  
---
Especially if there's another proper resto druid in raid - you will be healing nothing, since he will override your hots. And priests/pala/shaman will out-snipe you with Flash heals.
---
TUMMY STICKS
---
Did blizz say they would stuff 2-3 times as many players in a single server? I don't think I ever heard that. That would have probably swayed me to a PVE server.
---
if it was only pvp it would be fine, but then again ur playing horde ig, so you wouldnt know :D
---
You somehow ignore the point two factions in wow don't overlap or interact at all in any friendly by game design aside from neutral AH or AQ war effort (possibly). In fact, TOS prohibited that and while devilsaur/pvp mafia existed, it wasn't appreciated by the community much. You aren't supposed or expected to be kind or compassionate to an enemy and you're at war.
---
Grey/low moral aspects within the same community (like ninjaing) still exist but are much more rare now per player than before simply because community is more knowledgeable now. 
---
There is one exception which is MC duel FP abuse, I'd say this happens because of extremely competitive and grindy nature of wow pvp ranking.
---
Most renown/known vanilla pservers explicitly ended in one way or another before Classic. There are no active progression vanilla pservers in general. Other expansions and custom ones do what they did before but thats a way smaller niche.
---
It's complicated to talk about ethics in a game when you simply follow the rules of the game.
---
Like for example, it's not unethical to score a goal against your opponent team in soccer even if it makes the other team unhappy. It only becomes grey area when you try to bend the rules to your advantage and unarguably unethical when you cheat.
---
The problem in WoW classic at the moment is simply, to be blunt, that rules are dumb/broken: honor system is awful because it force mindless farming of the opposite faction to compete with your own faction. You are not rewarded to look for fair fight but encouraged to look for the least resistance. Imagine if it were the same in tennis: instead of winning points for winning grand slam, it would be who can score the more sets in a year. Instead of Nadal being number 1, you would have a nobody who play 25 children tournament each week all year at the top.
---
Would we say that the winner was immoral or that the rules of the game are simply dumb?
---
Why is this guy getting downvoted? WTF Reddit?
---
I cannot imagine dropping alchemy or herbalism (both 300) to lvl tailoring for one item. I think realistically I will have to commit to second pre-raid bis item
---
Let's be honest, the people spending all day camping others probably have very few connections to the outside world. They most likely lack frequent human interaction and simply don't know how to be part of society. A post like this will do nothing.
---
Because it's fucking hilariously cringy.
---
That would make sense, but Frost and some others literally pass it around as bypassing the standard coefficient rules.
---
Are you able to read? If so the answer was posted hours before you made your comment. If not, go back to school.
---
I will not experience this
---
My servers perfectly balanced
---
Like jerking off with sandpaper.
---
I think it was roughly a week back then, been a long time though. I'd expect it to be different considering much larger servers.
---
1. A good nameplate and unitframe addon that will display DoT durations. I can recommend Plater for nameplates without hesitation as it combines DoT durations, target cast bars above nameplates and a lot of different stuff while being highly customizable. https://i.imgur.com/tef3i8V.jpg
---
Unitframes are your choice. You can keep vanilla and get ClassicAuraDurations+some vanilla UI compatibile addon like Big Debuffs so you see your DoT durations (necessary) or go with non-vanilla and get ElvUI for example.
---
Apart from that, a Weakaura to show you how many Shards you have is handy and something to display target casting - ClassicCastbars or plenty of castbar addons do that now (Quartz, Gnosis likely).
---
2. This is DS/Ruin spec. Demonic Sacrifice from Demonology gives you flat 15% damage modifier when you sacrifice Succubuss.
---
I can get them for myself on my server on certain times during the day.
---
I bet it's a fucking gnome.
---
"If it was only PvP it would be fine"
---
Please explain what else is happening
---
Sadly they made bears, one of the coolest looking pets in the game almost useless.
---
Check out classic petopia for all pet related info.
---
lol, ive literally went back to horde because i didnt want my main mage to be gnome (and human mage racials for mage sucks way too much for me)
---
Unplayable? You chose to play on a PVP server, this is what you chose. In classic this was what wow was on pvp servers. You cant ask blizzard to change the game because it dosent suit you. I dont PVP myself and hell yeah it can be frustrating at times when i get corpse camped and spend alot of time just getting from A to B.. but this is the differance between a PVP and a PVE server, it’s hell of alot more exiting to venture around when the world is «dangerous» and that’s why i chose a PVP server.
---
I'm not super familiar with warriors, but I know whirlwind axe, corpsemaker, ravager, and mirah's song are all considered very good.
---
Yeah just because you got reported so much for an offensive name does not mean that name is offensive and can’t be reused.
---
True, but why give a mage a pvp item by doing pve when you could boost someone else's performance in both pve and pvp?
---
Gehennas, right? :D
---
You have to be there. Source: unable to give it to hunter that wasn’t present for kill in Classic.
---
As a warlock player I prefer to play with good healers who know healing me means faster dungeon clear
---
“I’m a responsible player”, Jesus Christ reddit pls
---
IIRC there is literally ONE EU pvp realm with alliance as a dominant faction and it's a german one :) Feel free to correct me.
---
&gt;then again they will hunt you for killing one of their own 
---
They won't: no one is going to chase someone instead of farming honor.
---
&gt;every fp is camped and are pre-aoeing before u can even land so that doesnt work so well 
---
Just don't use FPs to move then. It's not much of an issue.
---
In-game mail from gold sellers has always been a thing.
---
Same with World Enlarger.
---
Then there's your answer.
---
&gt;anger inducing amount of time
---
&gt;5 sec
---
That's gonna be an oof from me dawg
---
Golemagg EU
---
Getting to the raid? Do your players get there individually or as a group?
---
I got it on my mage. Id say for pvp its better than hinterlands or brd cape. Look better too. Probably wouldn't get it if i already had sapphiron drape
---
Yes, becase you take no damage and do more damage which means no rage.
---
We keep one of each meme spec for the fun of it. Plus two of our officers are a Mage and a Warlock and somehow end up in the Moonkin group. Weirdest thing.
---
no u didnt. i play alliance but dont lose your hope kid, someday you'll get it right. you have it in you, we all know you can do it.
---
Because he didn’t man it’s in the video lol...
---
99% sure a GM is one of his subs/friend and gave him the name change. Like I said, put in a ticket and ask for one and make up a reason why that sounds legit
---
I can agree with that. I thought they would've meant after their melee and hunters already have the neck (and tanks). Otherwise fuck giving it to someone for PvP before someone gets it for PvE bis
---
After your first couple deaths, you’ll have a res timer anyway
---
Onyxia resets Friday morning (NA) so you will be able to attend in the evening.
---
That is actually a good idea.
---
PSA to new tanks:
---
Get rid of the idea that only a tank can tank in classic.
---
You are a spot machine for oh shit moments.
---
Other then that feel free to use your dps as meatshields.
---
Also, whoever pulls it must be able to tank it, so let em die.
---
It’s reddit, most of these people suck at the game, you know the drill
---
Having to carry around multiple sets of gear would probably be so annoying.
---
Heartseeker is the only server not horde dominated and guess why? Because they all left those horrible servers, making balance issue even worse. Can you blame them? Fuck no.
---
they are going to do that since the amount of alliance in the wild is rare, like spotting a shiny in pokemon so yes they do chase you :) 
---
and i know there are other ways too move but not long distance, like getting on boats is not a thing unless you got a 40 man raid
---
&gt;Fourthly, running to UBRS for fire resistance buff? Really? People were doing this back in vanilla?
---
People were doing way more than that back in Vanilla. Ragnaros today is an absolute cakewalk compared to how he was when MC was new content. We have 1.12 itemisation and talents, and we have a substantially better understanding of his mechanics.
---
Classic WoW guilds would say you have shit DPS if you can't kill Ragnaros in phase 1, and most guilds never see phase 2.
---
Vanilla WoW guilds saw phase 2 every time. It was a core part of the fight.
---
You sound like a tool.. I didn't ask to join your guild, so why say that garbage?  And a weekend later, I have every single BiS i could need thanks to the actual helpful people here responding.
---
I suspect it’s less DPS  now than later. Once you got a handful of Fire Mages, that crit will translate a lot better.
---
How much did you pay the GM is the question I would ask
---
It’s not about honor. It’s about sending a message.
---
Fair enough points, we'll just have to agree to disagree. Such is life. Take care.
---
They are closing down many channels to deal with the chat delays.
---
&gt;Yes this.   
---
I'm also warlock, I started farming demonic runes and felclothes at level 55.   
---
Satyrs in Felwood are heavily farmed on my server. I mean, even at 5:00 in the morning it's pretty hard to find a mob alive.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There's 3 satyrs camps in Azshara, that's where I go now, it's farmed but not as much as Felwood. Felclothes drop rate is pretty much the same as Felwood.
---
"People can't play fairly and nice with each other, must be blizzards fault for people being dicks". Really guys?
---
Or they just like spending time alone whilst knowing they have RL people to rely on if they ever need to? There's a difference between shutting everyone out or just prefering doing things on your own. I work 85% and hang out with friends, but when I play WoW 20 hrs a day 3 days a week when I have time off from work and already spent saturday night with friends, you better believe that I'll camp the everliving shit out of people landing at flightmasters, because the system forces me to do that if I want to stay even remotely competetive.
---
Human warlock here, What spec is the best for soloing mara? I want to run it a lot of the next few weeks as I'm down on money after my epic mount, I'm half to 2 thirds geared in pre raid bis and new to soloing Mara, raiding, my guild is not having a problem, so something that fits with PvP also would be good, I'm thinking SM DS but want to know any opinions
---
Yoo that pisses me off so much. 
---
I tap down to even.
---
Get’s small heal from healer
---
I tap down to even
---
Gets small heal from healer
---
Gets big heal from healer so i’m at 100%
---
Taps down to even
---
Etc etc.
---
&gt;The problem in WoW classic at the moment is simply, to be blunt, that rules are dumb/broken:
---
Criticism of WoW Classic's design is not to be tolerated on this subreddit.
---
&gt;You are not rewarded to work toward a common goal against an opponent or to look for fair fights but encouraged to look for the least resistance
---
I think this is a good summary of the problem. Although, I would add that players already tend to like ganking, even without honor. Honor then actively encouraging ganking, especially with the game as optimized as it is, turns it into this shitshow.
---
I'm not blaming anyone. I'm pointing out that whichever faction is dominant is making life hell for the other faction. There is no "big mean horde" and "innocent little alliance", Alliance player do the exact same thing to the hordes when presented with the opportunity.
---
Haha me too, their ignorance will be their downfall.
---
&gt;stop playing 
---
I think this is the only true time-saving solution
---
What do you charge?
---
Do you also sell unwanted GS pieces up to domo or bring the hunter in for just Domo?
---
&gt; proccs of enchants 
---
I was answering in regards to enchants specifically (as you yourself referenced). That being said, if we consider flurry, while it is true that you you will hit faster and thus generate more flurry charges, it will also in turn consume more charges. Basically the gains are nullified.
---
Instead of choosing OH weapon by speed, you should focus on:
---
1. Racial weapon skill.
---
2. raw DPS
---
3. Stats.
---
If it is the honor spy addon it won't matter if you personally turn it off. Everyone would need to turn it off.
---
Simply because not all germans are able to speak english. Those who can not would been excluded. Also there are enough germans to fill 8 Servers at the moment. Spreading them onto Eu Servers would fill them up. Its nice to have a server in your motherstonge... since those wo want to play on a eu Server can still play on one. Its all about the choice
---
Forcing changes? Cramming 2-3-4x the population of Vanilla to Classic servers IS a change. Do you *actually* think a massively inflated server population is going to provide the same experience as back then?
---
You make a good point, and made me give it a second thought. Thank you for that!
---
Yes, in the end we're playing a game with a defined system, and if we want to progress in the game we have to follow the rules that are set. Yet, I feel like this goes against the very definition of ethics. Being ethic is something absolutely personal, and therefore we shouldn't let external forces change how we behave. I propose this example: would it be ethical of someone who lives in Saudi Arabia to be homophobic because those are the laws in their country? Culture could make them homophobic, that's how culture works. But it doesn't detract from the point that, ethically, being homophobic is wrong.
---
Yeah 5 times an hour... can’t live in there or can’t enter any other instances to help other guildies gear. Loadstone has yet to drop for anyone in our guild. I obviously have black hands.
---
If you dont like it you should play another game
---
I'm not dedicated to Alliance, I just cannot stand the Horde towns.
---
They are so dull, drab and lifeless. I've tried to roll a Shaman a few times since launch and cannot bring myself to continue after an hour or so.
---
Not always - I have a bunch of Brazilians in my guild (kurinaxx) and they are simply amazing people and players :)
---

We super outnumbered them bro, don't make a clown out of yourself please.
---
Check the classic shaman discord for all the shaman specific questions you have. Smart people over there!
---
Don’t like it, don’t play it.
---
The 30/0/21 build is just the best version of shaman in vanilla IMO. I played only as enhance in vanilla so I’m not an expert but the extra crit, NS and healing boosts in resto seem too good to pass up. Your roll in PVP is just super fun and versatile.
---
&gt; But server mergers would have been a better, and more vanilla, way to go anyways.
---
I find this hard to agree with considering it didn't work back then. Why would they make that mistake twice?
---
&gt; When a normal new player comes to check the sub, would he join ally?
---
Do you honestly think a massive amount of new players would suddenly appear out of nowhere, and then coincidentally join alliance side and make it 50/50 population?
---
In the old days of 2005, killing in the open world was an honorable profession. in 2019 it's been made into an industrial machine.
---
I mean... The guild isn’t that active aside from raiding hours... Not really very social or active in guild chat. Not to sound like a dick, but raiding and getting gear is the main reason I joined.
---
Loadstone actually has a lower drop rate than hoj
---
Well, there is slow internet slow, and then there is somebody cobbled this thing out of php and jquery slow and the latter infuriates me as a web dev. It is literally ten times what reddit takes to load.
---
HOTW/NS is fine for healing. The entire point of a druid as far as I can tell is to enable other classes to shine, and fill in where necessary.  Taladril (?) has a good YouTube discussion where he talks about how HOTW gets you 90% of the way for both healing and tanking, and doesn't make you totally redundant when playing solo. 
---
My advice, ignore meters. Stats only ever tell half a story. Your clutch battle res may save the raid/dungeon group from wiping, or pulling off a last minute NS/Max Rank HT on your tank. 
---
We are the unsung heroes of classic, but also collect epics quicker than anyone, fair trade.
---
Horde here, player from Sul'13. (Muzza, Orc Rogue)
---
While the server is trully dead, my guild (Endgame) still manages to somehow exist on its own and clear content + WBs..
---
Not sure how it will go from now on, but for now we're OK. Managed to set 2 MC cores and split our raid in 30s to do multiple Onys every week.
---
Yeah. Its Bad. Im a horde healer on Sul’thraze and it is almost impossible to grind dungeons on any level, since there is no one on LFG channels. 
---
Im 60 now, doing MC because my guild helped me a lot. But everyday i watch people on chats spend all day trying to find a single soul to BRD. ALL DAY! 
---
Eventualy they will get tired and stop playing the game. I almost did.
---
Filled out for ya bud :D
---
Do you know where I can find a link for it
---
A few hundred gold should be reasonable.
---
I'd suggest going for 3 piece for the slightly faster heals. There's also ToEP if your guild will let you get your hands on one. I don't main Priest so I'm not too familiar with any other must-have raid gear.
---
I assume Anathema is a given.
---
Good riddence to the ganking horde scum
---
I would say A reason would be that much of the honor gained was primarily gained by farming targets that have no ability to defend themselves.  IE res killing, being targeted by raid groups while you are in flight, and just get deleted on landing.  I know there are good honorable people as well.  How do you differentiate them however at this point?  I guess to me it would be a necessary evil.  Not the best solution I agree, but this is why we can have a discussion.
---
Their tone might change if they end up not increasing in rank, or even decreasing.
---
I imagine sacrificing the extra couple sustained dps is worth the extra chance at suddenly deleting a mother fucker, imo.
---
At least with elemental invasion next week there will be more available spawns.
---
How could you predict 5 to 1 population ratios? Private server experience?
---
Imagine playing on a PvP server and complaining about fair fights lol. PvP servers in WoW have always been full cancer corpse camps and level 60s in newbie zones. If you were dumb enough to roll on those servers, it serves you right lol
---
Man it's not a stretch to state that someone willing to play 16h/day isn't someone with huge problems. And experience will show you that these people are pretty much always the most toxic people existing.
---
I don't see what should make me salty but I guess it's just projection as often
---
When I started to play vanilla I was told that Intellect stat would increase the outcome of /roll
---
This is why I hate tanking pugs I have to be a baby sitter while dps face rolls their keyboard watching Netflix on a second monitor.
---
If I cared, yeah - but A) I don't mind memes being on this one, if I don't like it I can just scroll past, and B) ain't nobody got time to moderate that
---
Sure, not always. I'm also Brazilian and not like that, but I played for years and it's the reality, unfortunately.
---
Yep
---
I had a post detailing my experience and people shared theirs as well. See the latest thread from my post history.
---
oh a fellow BJJer ?
---
You want an addon like [this one](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/range-display).
---
Unoptimized code will wreck any servers no matter how good they are. If HonorSpy is causing this madness than the addon is 100% at fault and not Blizzard. Servers than run 3 times faster would still be ground to a halt eventually.
---
This is 99% Blizzard's fault actually.
---
So are you agreeing that you're motivated primarily by a desire to exercise revenge against these people?
---
I’ll go to the AH as soon as I get on and see what’s there, like I do every day... I’ve yet to see a single trinket on the AH on our server for under 500g
---
Brazilian playerbase is HUGE!!! But most didnt switched to Sul'13 for fear of that which is hapening right now..
---
1 - Server was created too late, so people were afraid of starting again or transfer and being stuck if the realm sucked;
---
2 - Server located in NA, which means same latency that we'd get from FULL servers;
---
3 - People afraid Blizz would not care about us;
---
Now the realm is indeed DEAD and players will not come.
---
I know a mage on the deathboat that does that. But the rogues kill the guy regardless...
---
Heaps
---
You're the one making an idiot of yourself with this joke of a video.  
---
You're a joke. 
---
Looking back into your other uploaded YouTube vids, you look like just the kind of pathetic person to post this video.
---
Definitely hot swapping. You're right I have 36 Thistle Tea atm. It's also a BS hammer not eng hammer. I do have barov's and skull of impending doom.
---
Here's a list of everything else:
---
* Frost / Shadow reflector
---
* Gnomish Mind Control Cap
---
* Goblin Rocket Helm
---
* Iron Grenades
---
* Some pieces of stam gear,
---
* Gnomish Battle Chicken
---
* Goblin Bomb Dispenser
---
* Mark of Resolution
---
* Gnomish Death Ray
---
* Hand of Justice
---
* Blackhand's Breadth
---
* Gnomish Rocket Boots
---
* Catseye Ultra Goggles
---
* Gnomish Net-o-matic Projector
---
* Dimensional Ripper - Everlook
---
Yeah that is the advantage. I can soon just take 4dps.
---
lol what an amazing retort - I am still playing it fam. 
---
However some folks really can't seem to get it into their noggins that it isn't PvP *itself* that's the issue, it's that the populations are currently far, far larger than the game was originally intended for and the consequences of that. I think come the 10th it'll be much better.
---
Free realm transfer *and* a free epic sword from Zul Farak to all alliance players there as a token of their noble struggle.
---
the worst kind of tank, the slow and unskilled one
---
Stopped reading to point out how beautiful the list of what different classes can do then "paladins can watch" love it. "See? All classes have something goin on"
---
This guy sounds more pathetic than anything anyone could ever do in this game, imagine lol.
---
Change it to PvE, it's already there anyway.
---
Well a lot of downvotes, since no one seems to play Horde on Reddit, i shall now assume we are the bad guys D:
---
Just wait till we all have to kill the same mob nesr there for the bwl attunement. Its gonna be a clusterfuck all week
---
You are absolutely right, I posed two situations that are indeed not comparable, in an effort to defend my point: that player's behavior have shifted from selfless acts to inmoral ones.
---
I apologize for my mistake, but still hope you understand what I was (badly) trying to say. You're also right, gaming culture is way more competitive and focused on optimization than back then, and perhaps what we're experimenting is the clash of a game design and a gaming culture that are not compatible. What is the solution here, then? Are we bound to have, in fact, #somechanges?
---
I too have this affliction
---
It wasn't the best for  hard cash. But their were other benefits.
---
One guy bought me dual spec 1000g.
---
Another gave free enchantments.
---
Plus was getting the gold from the runs. And plate items to help with the Gear Score.
---
It's not like I wasn't going to be running duegons aways, this just was a ticket to the insta queue.
---
\+dagger is useless in pvp for sure go for the scarlet kris
---
For offhand you mostly want fast AS and good stats/procs, you also want to have another OH with disarm immunity on it that you can switch to.
---
Also OH is much less important then MH as you'll very often switch OH to utility items such as skull, medicine pouch etc
---
Yeah, but you wont know that until after you kill them (or if you cast detect magic on them, which nobody does except at flight paths)
---
What about windfury, rogue poison, weaponoil and other stuff on offhand?
---
Would be a shame if weapon speed isnt a choice at all cause every procc is a rppm.
---
I've seen like 2. But ok! Have fun. Please place all salt in the proper receptacle for Horde pickup!
---
I would watch it if it were shorter
---
Die in the instance and then park your ghost outside the entrance until a full group arrives.
---
Okay karen
---
Considering I die the second I get flagged on my Shaman, I decided to reroll on Pagle-A and I'm having a lot more fun.
---
Faux means fake, to imitate. I'm saying the outrage going on here is fake.
---
While sure you don't need shit, but not popping a gffp on rag is just fucking lazy.
---
We fought as a group.  Woe betide those that feel behind.  Nor exactly sure why you're trying to make excuses for miserable gameplay lmao
---
I'd count 4 people in a group looking to gank alliance vs 4 randoms who just want to ride the boat as a significant advantage for  the first squad akin to outnumbering them by 2-3 people.
---
We don't know how much higher, but Blizzard has stated on numerous occasions that the populations are much higher.
---
[Example](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update-august-21/262141)
---
&gt; All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.
---
No, it is not a revenge to me.  It would be to balance and gameplay.  It is not about pvp on a pvp server, its about game mechanics and the abuse of it.  I am thinking about the players, why they are leaving and what it would take to retain and possibly bring them back.
---
Yes, I observed something similar with the mage list. In many scenarios greens were preferred to an absurd level.
---
this is what pvp servers are always like
---
what the hell did people rolling on PVP server expect?
---
Lets trade tanks.  I always get slow mongoloids.
---
Emperor’s new trousers 😀
---
Was trying to sneak in BRD yesterday for my MC attunement, got killed 7 times on the way in. After a failed attempt to Lava Run, I spirit rezed at Thorium, where I was killed by a mage. So I spirit rezed again, and I was killed by the mage and 2 more friends. So I literally spirit rezed 8 more times, as they racked up the honorless kills. 
---
Theres PVP, then there is stupidity. Classic has devolved into a griefer's wet dream.
---
Succubus if you're a draintank, VW if not.
---
no lol
---
This thread is about Skeram and I'm responding to someone that said they're on Skeram and I even said I was on the same side as the person I responded to.
---
You're the same person that told me I didn't know what faux means on another comment. Learn to read man. Get a dictionary and read context into posts.
---
Whats specially funny...
---
If you mindcontrol a human mob and the lowlevel attacks this specific mob - he gets flagged for pvp.
---
You've yet to justify how taking honor already earned by people will keep existing players or draw old ones back. Changing it so they're no longer honor targets achieves this, in what way does punishing players for playing the game the way it was designed help anyone?
---
Me: *Pulls out jumper cables* "Hold my drink!"
---
Yeah second kid is a totally different topic. I have "only" a 11 months old girl and we can perfectly manage to play some here and there. level 53 rn but I never push it really. I was pretty hc 15-14 years ago and I promised it wont be the same now :D
---
1. WF uses PPM.
---
2. Rogue poison - I dont know as I only play warrior.
---
3. Shadow oil is 15% proc chance since it literally states in the item tooltip: *"
---
Use: When applied to a melee weapon it gives a **15%** chance of casting Shadowbolt III at the opponent when it hits. Lasts 30 minutes."*
---
You pull it, you tank it. Also, you get no heals.
---
The alliance transferred off before this. The ones that are left are a little more crazy.
---
What spec is the best for soloing mara? I want to run it a lot of the next few weeks as I'm down on money after my epic mount, I'm half to 2 thirds geared in pre raid bis and new to soloing Mara, raiding, my guild is not having a problem, so something that fits with PvP also would be good, I'm thinking SM DS but want to know any opinions
---
Nope.
---
Old school PvPers used to PvP like crazy until they're rank 14, then visit their friendly neighborhood RMT site to get the gold needed for the weapons.
---
haahhaah
---
Phase, man. Phase.
---
If you don't use consumables in your 5v1 how will the other player know you're a mouth-breather?
---
Dont skip leg day.
---
I’m leveling both a lock and a healer. As a lock I try to tell heals just to keep me above 60% health (unless I’m taking direct damage) and I’ll handle the rest. As a healer I try to tell the lock my focus is keeping them above 75% health. Haven’t had any complaints with that system, yet.
---
Dont bother with those two maces so early, I got myself an ardent custodian for 12g from ah until I can afford any of those two. The stats ot offer are very good for the price.
---
This time of year always brings people together...
---
Brazilians is a disrespectful people through and through. It’s just not the wow community. It’s every sport, event and everything in between. If lots of Brazilians are in the same location it will suck for everyone there, including themself.
---
Uh vai morrer!
---
A lot of people are going to say "lulz shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server then!" -- but these people are missing the point.
---
This isn't PvP.  This is Honor Farming.  The people engaging in the behavior that's causing these complaints are actively *avoiding* PvP - if there's even an encounter where the enemy has any potential to fight back, they avoid it and/or move entirely to another zone.  The goal is not to PvP - it's to maximize honor/time.  They're not interested in actual competitive player versus player engagements; they're interested only in quickly killing players that have no potential to fight back.
---
There was nothing like this in Vanilla.  This is a novel experience created by the attempt to emulate the vanilla experience, and it's destroying other aspects of the vanilla experience.
---
Is there a doctor on board? 
---
*Pulls out runecloth bandages*
---
Some would deem it immoral to charge for tanking to a dungeon in which you already need gear from.
---
I highly highly doubt it. I bet you mean revered
---
It was meant more as an exercise of insight, a thoughtful discussion about what's going on, instead of  a shallow complain and leave it at that. If it was meant as an overreaction, it wasn't my intention. I'd like to say though, that not experiencing a situation personally doesn't mean that the situation doesn't exist in the first place. What could be felt as an overreaction by some, could be a reality to others.
---
Yes, at the end of the day we're killing each other. But you must be with me in this: WoW Classic is not Fortnite or PUBG. The game design and its philosophy is way different, isn't it? And, at the end of the day, you are killing people in a video game.
---
Depends on the spell as to what rank starts getting more sp bonus, first rank after 20 seems to be the case.  
---
One point, check the spell on wowhead for the sp bonus ratio.  Some spells get more bonus from stuff than others natively, usually longer casts.  Some get .6, some get .8, some 1.0...etc.
---
Nope. I'm exalted. I have the 5 all resist enchant on my T1 warrior shoulders.
---
So long as its high pop there's plenty of killing on both sides. If you don't want to deal with that you should probably go PvE because there's always going to be somebody camping popular leveling spots.
---
Interesting post. I generally agree that the behavior of the players could improve but a realist acknowledges that systems guide behavior. If players are competing with other players and if being lenient or beneficent disadvantages them against their competition then they will be seldom kind. So, in that regard, it is a game design problem. The thing is that it's moreso a newly introduced systems problem: Blizzard released Classic on layered megaservers. The scale precluded the formation of solid communities. The scale precluded reputation mattering. The scale determines that the world is much, much more populated than it is designed for. And the honor starved players behave as literally starving animals: they consume all in their path until nothing is left. Because they don't know their competition, either on their own faction or the other, they do not care how they hurt them. 
---
Blizzard had every opportunity to anticipate this. I anticipated it (though not to this extent). Others anticipated it. So while it is entertaining to pontificate about how people would, could, or should behave, let there always be a smoldering disdain for what Blizzard did to this game by changing it so much.
---
Eat shit.
---
Oh I was just thinking end gamish but yes that is a great weapon until then.
---
Destruction spells cost a lot of mana. Using rain of fire 2-3 times can drain the mana bar.
---
Except with alliance it's usually an attempt at revenge and the horde is just toxic behavior. Stop making excuses and just own up to your factions abusive tendencies
---
I keep hearing this word unplayable (often in caps, LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE) but that is pure hyperbole.
---
So I find it hard to take a lot of complaints seriously.   
---
No way will blizz reset honor, no way will they restrict it to certain zones, they won't be adding guards, nerfing rogues or anything like that.  
---
The only real solutions if you want to keep playing are in your own hands:
---
* Crack on as best you can. 
---
* Wait until BGs come and hope things change.  
---
* Create an alt and play that, you'll be fairly safe for 25-30 levels. 
---
* Reroll on a pve server. 
---
Or combine all 3.
---
Its Warcraft. War is dirty.
---
Its not always the heroic honorable kill, where you kill the opponent faction player just cause you want save a fello  player.
---
Its mostly just killing the other faction.  Mostly by outnumber them. 
---
But thats part of the fantasy, cause you cant communicate between factions. Thats the beauty of it.
---
Its mostly cause of language barriers and misunderstanding, that a conflict happens.
---
as someone who mostly played pvp server in vanilla, never again lol
---
I just laugh at the people in this thread who are upset about being attacked on PVP servers, like what did they expect to happen?
---
PVP server wow has always been toxic and getting ganked 3:1 and camped was always part of the experience, this isn't new
---
I tried to make a post deeper than one about pvp being unfair, but I can't promise I did a good job. If the post is tagged as 'discussion', what's the point of commenting that you won't "read this shit"?
---
They should force mig every Portuguese speaking player there, lock the server and never look back. Get that scum off normal servers.
---
I'm levelling a priest, what's the best way to set up my key bindings?
---
I've heard that the top strat for Sindragosa in Wrath was actually to have a hunter pet tank her, since her damage output is primarily in the breath which is reduced by 90% by Avoidance.
---
I murdered indiscriminately before p2, I will still murder indiscriminately once BGs hit.  Grey player?  Just questing?  Doesn't  matter red=dead.  Farming honor was never the objective.
---
Um see if this works:
---
https://discord.gg/Vh4XT7
---
Not sure if it changes or not.
---
That would be pointless. AM have 100% coefficient.
---
Dynamic spawning? the more people are around, the faster mobs spawn?
---
Not sure whether this is active in classic
---
You did not get exalted with AD 2 months ago. The game has only been out for 3 months.
---
Haha thanks!
---
Oh yes, transfering to a different server with different players to exact revenge.
---
ally :P
---
Pls send help
---
I’m sorry, but why would you HS?! Isn’t there way more abilities to use for more threat?
---
It's called entertainment...?
---
I don't get it either, but I guess some people find it hilarious. Probably the same people who say "Pog" or "Ok Boomer" (to which I always reply "Read a book" or the true vanilla response "Learn to play"). 
---
Source: Millennial
---
Exactly, there are some good items for tanking before you start you bis search, like the armor ring from ulda, princess ring and ZF shoulders.
---
I dont seethe problem. If they need guidance im there. Im not some pompous prick telling them how to play their class im merely stating helpful tips when they ask. There are plenty of new players who like to do their best. Try being nice once in awhile instead of demonizing and demoralizing your party members. I am quiet most of the time unless we are dying alot at which point i make suggestions and almost every time they say thanks
---
Do you have a talent build I can base off?
---
the current server threshold of concurrent players online is around 3-4k
---
So glad I left Skeram when I had the chance.
---
makes me wish i had rolled a hunter again :C
---
Yep, got my pally to 53 on skeram before p2 hit but haven't logged in but a few times since then. First time I got on I was killed before my shit had even loaded while standing at the TP flight path, but as soon as I rezed I bubble hearted to IF and was killed immediately in the inn. I have tried to log on several times then and only once did I not die immediately, but I logged off after 30 minutes since I couldn't find a BRD group.
---
I love WoW, and have played since vanilla but I have never been so discouraged to play before. I feel helpless... I dumped so much time over the past few months into a server that I can't even log into my bank alt on. What pisses me off the most is that for the first time in my WoW "career", I'm not having fun. Me and 5 irl buddies joined and leveled togehter, but we can't even log onto our toons and meet up in game without being shit on.
---
Now in sure you guys will just say
---
 "you should have rolled on a normal server" and I agree but I have always been on pvp servers as both alliance and horde and it was never like this. Now I'm not asking the horde on skeram to chill, I would be doing the same thing if I was in their shoes. Idk what the solution to this rant is, I'll just stop now.
---
Same on every big server. I just started leveling an alt on a mid/high realm until BGs absorb the worst
---
Well I did say its not the best solution.  Yes there are other ways.  Like you said the honor less target is one, but it does not seem to be a deterrent at the moment.  I do not look at it as punishing, although it could be felt that way by some people, just as others feel punished by the state of pvp right now, which is unplayable in certain situations.  Playing the way the game the way it was designed or the way it was intended could be debateable as well.  15 yrs later with so much more technology, advanced knowledge of the game, and the min max game play instead of the role play element.  All these things should be on the table for discussion.
---
Im from Canada (Toronto), playing on Hydraxian Waterlords EU. I get around 105ms ping. It not bad and I raid without issues.
---
I said that but he seems to be ally cause he has a horse
---
Are you sure about the real procc per minute?
---
As far i remember classic didnt had it - it came very late Wotlk or Cata. 
---
Could be in the current game, cause nobody knows what patch-patchwork we playing on.
---
Idk why you're wasting time eloquating any form of thoughtful response to this actual dumbass
---
Which is why OP made this, as the streamers have a big influence on the Classic community and if they aren't corrected people will take their word as gospel.
---
&gt;"I don't understand basic cause and effect"
---
okay
---
What's the best wiki out there for reference points? I'm a noob to the game and decided to make a shaman after getting my Hunter to around \~30. The more minimalist it is, the better.
---
The fucking 80s haircut lmao
---
This is exactly why I gank. Honour is just icing on that sweet cake.
---
This is almost as sad as the alliance in Feralas that retreat to the civilian on the ridge to purposely bait you to tag it.
---
I feel like I'm going to start killing 47s and lower now out of spite now.
---
Yep 👍
---
My best tip is to keybind eg the numpad for different marks. My num1 is skull, 2=X, 3=sheep and so on. Quick marking makes the whole group think your really professional :)
---
I'm not counting the days so I dunno, maybe it was 1 month ago.
---
Yeah I never interrupt, purge, or drop totems you right man. Classic mad difficult mechanically.
---
Looks amazing. Can you share your setup?
---
Perhaps apply for a job at Blizzard and tell them you can make it faster.
---
Huh? Ive run brd a lot on my warrior lately and usually 15+ allies have BRM locked down. The only horde i see are corpse walking with me in a conga line. I must be unlucky w the timing i guess
---
LOL go back to retail
---
I did them sort of in order I most often cast them and keys for spells i spam the most. 1 holy fire, 2 shadow word pain, 3 mind blast, 4 renew and F for smite, q for inner fire
---
True, most people in situations as described are hoping it all changes by the 10th, with BGs out. Yet, it was meant more as a thoughtful discussion about the situation we're living, rather than when (and if) will this end, although some observations could lead to a possible path out of the hole, going further than the 'red=dead' and 'I'm in a PvP server and I don't enjoy PvP' arguments
---
No, they haven't. This was never a thing to this level in the past.
---
I'm a total noob and fine with mage... Perfect class for noob doesnt exist !
---
And they lose like 10 or less honor depending on how many they are.
---
You are lucky I guess, I wasnt accepted to tank in groups for brd until i got to 55.
---
The chest droprates are fucked cause of the other items' droprates. There's two of like ten blues in each chest and they have the same dropchance. Tribute runs are damn easy and fast.
---
One more question: What exactly makes it more fun? As I see it, seal fate does use Backstab in place of SS and that's more or less it.
---
5 man parties trying to kill as much uncontested and bailing when shit gets messy is truly not boring content, not at all
---
At the end of the day this is something we all spend a lot of time doing, and just because it's pixels and beeps doesn't mean it isn't meaningful.
---
The medium of your interaction with people isn't what decides whether or not it's meaningful, the interaction itself does.  People have gotten married and had offspring because of their interactions within wow, and those offspring are playing wow for the first time now. Whether you want to admit it, this game is special and meaningful to a lot of people.
---
The world spends most of its time online, we need to finally stop pretending that it's just some 'pretend other' world.  For better or worse, this is a part of our lives.  A conversation on the phone isn't not meaningful just because it's transmitted wirelessly and you're not face to face.
---
There was more world pvp in phase 1. I pvped so much. In phase 2 you res, move 10 feet, die, res, move 10 feet, die. That or mega lag at world bosses.
---
It's not PvP, it's something else. And it's strange how the "world pvp phase" killed world pvp.
---
No it's horrible.  Imagine one person in a group you're fighting is an honorless and you kill him.  Bam your whole group gets a dk
---
Classic Threat Meter is the one to get, right? Because it notifies others using it about their threat details
---
hahahahahaha cool, representing our guild &lt;3
---
Agreed, quite trendy. I also would like to know the name of this addon.
---
* Crack on as best you can.  
---
Yes, keep just getting ganked at res or at landing at fp.  Over and Over  
---
Some people are doing this, and probably are playing a different game right now.  Some might come back.  
---
* Create an alt and play that, you'll be fairly safe for 25-30 levels.  
---
Clearly if you do this then your main char is "unplayable" forcing you to reroll to be able to play the game.  
---
* Reroll on a pve server  
---
Again, proof that your character is unplayable on the server so you suggest moving to another server.  Its not about pvp, its about game mechanics.
---
Farm you Baron cloak allready.
---
OP racials both retail and classic. That's the short explanation.
---
Lol most Horde dont realise there wont be new players, the game has been released there arent going to be any big spikes just declines. Im sticking around so i can watch this game die.
---
He rolled a rogue on a PVP server, we all know why. Now he doesn't like being on the receiving end.
---
thank you, this is what I was looking for. Still learning to tank, so want to be a bit higher than bare min.
---
Yep, whenever the group is 'sneaking' past a pack that might get pulled I'm the first across. But as soon as I'm 'past' the pack I turn around and watch everyone else run past the pack.
---
I keep my target on one of the mobs and my finger over the charge button. Then if they ass-pull I'm straight in and it's a normal pull more or less.
---
PuGs don't seem to understand how much harder it is to generate threat when you don't start with aggro. So charging in when a pull goes wrong is a great help.
---
I was in a similar predicament having the same professions and being a dps caster.  Most guilds will probably ask for you to do this to make the raid group, others may not. I dropped Herbalism after I could afford my epic mount and started farming cloth. I was able to get to 300 Tailoring in about a day or two and after about 100g spent in the AH for recipes and Runecloth/Leather, so not terrible. It may take longer to get a 2nd bis robe than you think which is why I recommend it. Tailoring will guarantee your bis robe assuming you can farm the mats easily. I wasn't thrilled about doing it at the time, but looking back I'm glad that I did.  I already have my Herbalism back to 300, that didn't long to do with a very fast mount. I hope this helps.
---
I main an Orc Rogue, only log for MC+ONY and pot/consumable farms now since i'm full BiS.
---
Tryed to level an Orc Shaman and cound't pass lvl 25, shamans are awesome,  but i just can't bring myself to do all the damn quests again... Just have no energy...
---
So now i'm leveling a Human Rogue on a PVE server.. Quests and zones aren't the same! Having a blast at lvl 41 now.
---
Vividly accurate analogy
---
Might also incentivize them to camp you longer to get the honor from the kill or even out of spite
---
Rolled a rogue on a PVP server expecting to be pitching, ended up catching, no sympathy.
---
Vanilla experience? Been that way forever. Pvp inclined people roll horde, pve inclined people roll alliance.
---
&gt; in the past few years especially, really exacerbated people's selfishness and narcissism.
---
We had a bunch of guys mess up a small event in a server to celebrate a player that had unfortunately died. They got absurdly famous, and it is a single example from back then
---
Online gaming has always had a huge pool of crap
---
I love this movie so much that my characters name is 
---
 “Biggulpshuh”
---
source or gtfo.
---
Does anyone have a good guide to read about warrior tank itemization?
---
Use the print screen button
---
I have a 50 priest, 28 mage, 21 rogue, and 26 pally.
---
Yes. People are playing other characters.
---
Wait, are you having fun in a video game? Don’t think that’s allowed sir.
---
This is a very thoughtful answer, thank you for that. I was adamant to accept that outside rules shape how we behave, as I replied to someone else in this post, but your point makes me re-evaluate it once more.
---
 herod struggle indeed... I'm typing this right after alt f4ing was trying for 15 minutes to fly to ironforge from meneth. Someone tell me why there's 4 rogues and a priest camping 1 FP at 6 in the fucking morning
---
Good point😂 my bad
---
In actual vanilla the factions were way more balanced. What's going on right now can hardly constitute war. Its more like 200 horde occasionally getting a delicious alliance snack once every 5 minutes.
---
There's barely any group pvp even happening. Whatever faction war there was is over
---
you shouldnt be lazy about a choice like this, even with lag i guarantee its 100% preventable to pick the wrong item if you are focusing so yea i agree with gm its on you if you get the wrong one
---
I could agree on the point that faulty scripts and bugs are changes in some kind of way even though that's not intended. But using the latest vanilla patch is not a change at all.
---
If somebody kills me when I am leveling I am not abused. I just got killed in a video game.
---
Even in the worst case over the absurd scenario where entire guilds are multiboxing 10 characters with spy addon covering literally the entire world I just go to pve server or dont play the game. The "damage" you get from getting killed when ganked is minimal.
---
&gt; "I believe correlation IS causation"
---
If we're going to devolve into sarcastic remarks I might aswell join in I suppose.
---
&gt;just as others feel punished by the state of pvp right now, which is unplayable in certain situations
---
And that logically leads to "punish the other side" how?
---
&gt;Playing the way the game the way it was designed or the way it was intended could be debateable as well. 15 yrs later with so much more technology, advanced knowledge of the game, and the min max game play instead of the role play element. All these things should be on the table for discussion.
---
Explain to me how more technology and more game knowledge changes camping a flight path or camping BRM. Do you actually believe this didn't happen in Vanilla? 
---
You're just throwing out words now. You're not actually explaining or justifying *any* of it.
---
Or you know, play on a PvE server?  And I am not condescending.  -I- play on a PvE server.  it is more relaxed and chill.
---
Running into some aggro issues on Rag lately. So as a melee, I’ve been doing the in and out dance for the knockback properly, but about half the time I - and often several other melee - will suddenly pull aggro and get popped with a crushing blow. Our threat meters will all say that the tanks are still way ahead of us, and whenever we die, it’s not often right after the melee going back in (8 seconds between tank taunt and my death, for instance). I’ve been poking around and found out two things with the knockback:
---
- the knockback is a total threat wipe, yet the threat meters will not account for this
---
- the knockback will only ever knock back 3 players with the lowest GUID, which is a sort of SSN made per character when first created
---
With the above in mind, I have some questions. First, is there a threat meter that DOES account for this threat wipe, or do I need to somehow manually reset the meter after each knockback? Second, is the information about the GUID true? If so, does that mean 10 melee and 2 tanks can eat the knockback with only 3 actually being sent back?
---
If you pm me i might be able to offer some assistance! Im also on fairbanks alliance.
---
gonna try again. Is there anything like  qlimmunity clock out for classic that tracks fear immunity and warn you if a -player- is immune to fear and their CDs on fear immunity abilities? Like immunitycloak will warn you when WoD is used by a specific player, it's duration and CD time. So if you're 2v1 vs to undeads you can track when each of them has used their WoD, Iceblock, Berserker Rage etc. 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/q-immunity-clock
---
(no necrosis doesn't work it only tracks if mob is immune to fear, like mechincal etcs.
---
Lol what was the original text
---
I don't know what you think you gain from being pedantic, but if Classic is a diluted experience in contrast to the game that vanilla players played and then came back for, then we say it is watered down.
---
I never complain to tanks - I know how rough the job is (having done a lot of tanking myself throughout the years, but it often annoys me when we skip trash packs that we can barely squeeze by.  In places like strat, where fears a prevalent, I appreciate very much when a tank clears a wide path.
---
I prefer questing over running dungeon but as I know how hard it is to find a tank I generally accept when group ask me. I had some good and bad runs during my leveling but nothing come close to what I'm experiencing in ZF, war dps charging in and WW before I land a single sunder, every dps hitting a different mob, hybrid healer with only 5-6 healing pieces of gear having the nerve to tell me "I hope you're not one of those guys tanking without shield", bitch I'm in full enchanted blue plate... 
---
Now when people pull I just let them deal with it, you pull you tank, not my problem anymore, and if people start giving me shit for that I just leave the group.
---
I don't even think /u/YeetTheLion plays the game.
---
Dunno about a wiki, I would just use a guide like the one [on WoWHead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/shaman-leveling-classic-wow).
---
&gt; Man it's not a stretch to state that someone willing to play 16h/day isn't someone with huge problems.
---
o wups thought Top 10 meant the rank like just before the pvp mount. 
---
My bad.
---
With that said I kinda disagree. Huge problems yeah but not necessary problems that make them toxic but that's whatever to me.
---
fantastic.  thanks.
---
WTF?
---
Bloodfang is alright - some alliance transferred over at the start of p2, so it is/feels a little bit more alliance heavy, like 45:55
---
Why would I want to dismiss a totem? This isn't a rhetorical, question. I have a 32 shaman, and I don't know of a reason to dismiss a totem.
---
Go with a paladin tank. They need two mana breaks for every one you need.
---
There's a combat rogue in my guild that farms SFK constantly for BoE blues. It's nice too because he welcomes and lowbie alts to come along for exp and boss drops, and it basically lets people skip level 15-28 or so if they stuck it out long enough in his groups.
---
Yes, I would say of the last 10 runs I've done it's horde that has brm on lockdown. Mostly evening eu time.
---
That's how you understand the game, and that's the fantasy you enjoy in WoW. It may cost your victims a corpse run or two, but that's implied in PvP servers. The dire situation arises when someone simply can't play the game because they're being farmed continuously, non stop, incesantly. And I think that's a different situation than what you're stating you like to do.
---
I will perma queue and requeue you and your faction with 7 accounts of out 10 and when the mesage pops....REQUEUE AGAIN! :)))))
---
If you skip all PvP talents and take improvements for Wrath and Moonbeam - it would be possible.  
---
In the end I just leveling another character to farm gold and playing full resto druid in raids/pvp. Having Swiftmend is a godsend for clutch situations, so I don't use Moonglow build anymore.
---
well alright then, see ya!
---
PPM existed in vanilla. Internal proc CDs however did not. They came in TBC (melee trinket from Leotheras the blind is a good example of this).
---
Maybe not to this level due to the population sizes (thanks layering!!) - but this was definitely a thing in Vanilla
---
They're not talking from a horde stand point my friend
---
Ok
---
I did it at 48 was great!
---
Yeah but than the tanks get a healer like OP that just spams max rank spells and oom's every pull. I dunno how some tanks deal with it.
---
Yeah I get that, and no you're not being abused, you're right.
---
But it is worth *trying* to get people to think about what they're doing. Even if it's ultimately futile. A failed attempt can lead to a successful one.  It's no secret that the default internet personality is 'edgy douchecanoe'. It didn't used to always be that way.
---
Ethics and morality shouldn't just disappear because no one's around to punish you by punching you in the face.
---
Is that what we are as a species?  Unrepentant self interest if no one's around to physically check us? Is that all that we are?
---
Yes it definitely was. And everyone was warned about it in the lead up to Classic release. Enjoy being corpse camped lol.
---
i will queue on your 10 man bgs, block an ID and when BG instance pops GUESS WHAT? A PREMADE WILL HAVE TO REQUEUE AGAIN!
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA
---
https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw
---
go into the #tank-faq channel, make sure you properly read everything before you start asking questions in General chat since they are pretty strict about that
---
I think they expected people to drop off and leaving the server at an optimal level.
---
I say give up the 5% off-hand crit and go with Silent Fang for some real fun.
---
As an alliance on an alliance minority server, I love the sound of that!
---
yea, im biased.
---
Its not cooldown, its debuff duration.
---
Threatplate has a Buff/debuff tracker on nameplates.
---
Why do you want to be in a Guild who laughs at member who want specific loot for their specc? The ring is insanly good for PvP mages. Besides, if he raids with them, he can expect to get loot in the same quantity as others.
---
Guess again. look how many lads came with brilliant ideas :)

---
I'm not pedantic, your statement implied (to me at least) that classic was intentionally made easier than vanilla, wihch is true if you compare it to other versions than the latest probably.
---
It’s like this on Deviate Delight discord too. Even though horde are outnumbered it’s still cancerous to try to get to anything in BRM and when you do get a group together as alliance and annihilate them, you can bet they’ll be on discord crying about how alliance always roams in packs to beat horde.
---
Horde players are really just subhuman cry bullies.
---
I don't think you understand what PVP server means.
---
It's like choosing 'harder' setting and getting mad that it's hard.
---
Above where? I see what you claim to be a quote from them and a description of what you said, not what you said exactly
---
Absolutely everyone who played vanilla know that R14 is a 20h/day farm. 
---
Remember "you think you want it but you don't"? 
---
That bein said because crybabys like you ruined the actual game askung for shit over years, and now are playin classic doing the same.
---
Vanilla was elitist, vanilla was farm, vanilla was easy pve and a loooot of people ruining your day every 15min.  Welcome classic.
---
If you remember vanilla like great and fun game all the time its becouse you standed all day over a mailbox being 12yo kid or was watching pvp videos with let the bodies hit the floor theme and crying at night for not being able to pay wow cause you was 12yo kid.
---
Sorry for beinge that way but thats the reality.
---
So much crying.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/jPzKA7g](https://imgur.com/a/jPzKA7g)  thats rich.
---
18 death runs from thorium point to BRD yesterday. 
---
There were lvl 40 horde standing out there tagging people for hk farming. 
---
You die as soon as you spawn, so you just rez max distance each time. For clarity, I'm not talking about BRM. I'm talking about the entire zone.  It's a joke right now.  no one looks at you long enough to see an honorless debuff.
---
&gt; It's no secret that the default internet personality is 'edgy douchecanoe'. It didn't used to always be that way.
---
It was, and it will forever be.
---
&gt; Ethics and morality shouldn't just disappear because no one's around to punish you by punching you in the face.
---
Is that what we are as a species? Unrepentant self interest if no one's around to physically check us? Is that all that we are?
---
This is a goddamn roleplaying videogame. When I get killed I wasnt brutally murdered or abused. People are playing withing the rules of the game I chose to play.
---
So in other words this picture of a dwarfs ass isn't in enough detail for your liking?
---
Ok Zud, thanks for the input
---
Nice try NewGen
---
I'm fairly certain if you have a shaman up there with a earth bind totem you physically can't make the jump.
---
Almost as strong as tier 1? Tier 1 is shit for most classes.
---
I do not need a step by step.  The reason I see for it is because it would return it to a beginning state.  Being that we cannot go back and differentiate the good the bad and the ugly, it would be logical to reset it.  Lots of ugly going on.  If blizzard made pvp MECHANICS more balanced that would bring people back.  I understand pvp, what is going on right now might be labeled pvp but it really is bad.  Just like sex.  There is the word sex.  You can do it.  You can do it with a consenting adult.  You can do it with a minor.  One is very bad, but you can do it.  Thats why there are rules.
---
Not sure what youre on about i play on Skeram Alliance which is like 85/15 for horde lol
---
Why is that a thing, by the way? Seems like it punishes you for getting camped.
---
Perhaps you didn't read my last paragraph, and therefore think it's just a 'pvp bad' post. While, yes, playing on a PvE server indubitably solves the problem, I think the interesting point in the discussion is to dissect and understand the 'unnatural' (for lack of a better word) situation that's happening in PvP servers
---
While I generally agree there's a lot of situation when dps will pull aggro if you're playing fast enough. Just means everyone pulls their weight. Can't wait for sunders before every mob, it's not a raid instance or a boss fight. In 5 mans even most boss fights are fine to pull boss a bit - you just taunt back and you're up there and keep pushing... dps will stop for a second or two to save themselves which should be good enough for most situations.
---
Can someone tell this noob which addon it is that displays the trinkets like in the video?
---
Patrol mobs in Dungeons and Raids
---
Lyceum in BRD
---
I dinged 60 with that same spec and as soon as I respeced sm/ruin at 60 for dungeon pre-bis farm my dps increased a crazy amount. Can’t ever imagine a 3 second SB again. Miss dark pact a little running between packs in dungeons but just need to use first aid more often. Seems like if you tap a few times and band aid the healer respects that and then tends to throw heals and not get annoyed. Or just let them know not to heal you unless they have more than 75% mana or something. Then you can sl, and drain life a couple mobs after tapping and you’re all good
---
Pm me your discord so I can add you and send the text doc
---
Why did you roll on a pvp server? What did you expect?
---
I've asked myself the same question.  It's one thing to murder a lowbie, once or twice (maybe you didn't keep count) but its another thing to just sit and camp. Like, when you're older, maybe you realize that some people don't have the a lot of time to play (jobs, significant others, kids, etc), but that's a shit excuse because when I played this in college 15 years ago, I never had the desire to camp anyone (unless they camped first).
---
I got a 60 mage with a bit of mc gear but looking to make a paladin alt on another server (mage is horde). Anyone know a good alliance server ?
---
It could be at EU PvP server and it would be true. Shazzrah here.
---
What class doesn’t have a significant inventory sink? Mage maybe?  
---
Paladin/Druid/Warrior/Priest/Shaman: Multiple gear sets. 
---
Hunter: Quiver + Arrows, Pet food. 
---
Warlock: Soul shards. 
---
Mage: ??? A few reagents for portals isn’t too tough and most classes have that. 
---
Rogue: Poisons, blind/vanish etc. reagents.
---
no comments about the runecloth bag lol
---
&gt; is considered one of the most toxic.
---
What... what!? XD by who?
---
Have you seen league of legends? CSGO? CoD!? WoW community has got nothing on them
---
I'm on Stalagg. Considering it was in the 2nd to last group to move to a single layer I'd say population wise it's in the higher end, but not topping the charts.
---
nah you don’t need to aggro them for it to be safespotting. A Gm flew down from the heavens on Skeram to tell the Horde to get off the buildings in Southshore, even if they didn’t aggro guards.
---
I've never seen a mage even come close on threat meter compares to fury warrior in raid, so I don't see how they'd have problems? 
---
you don't even need plate for trash, they just don't hit hard enough. pop a shield for boss and you're gtg
---
Don't quote me on this, I might be totally incorrect but I seem to remember that on extremely rare occasions AV could spawn either a Rich Thorium node or Black Lotus in the middle of the Battlefield, where teams tended to clash on the initial run. Again, this was extremely rare and I'm not sure which patch that even belonged to (if at all). - Possibly why some private servers included it.
---
Pretty much zero. There are no drops whatsoever in WSG and only items relevant to AV in AV. The NPCs may drop some basic lvl 55 loot as well, but you won't get many of those unless you specifically farm them.
---
Start by learning that the PRINT SCREEN button works a whole lot better then using your cell phone to take a screenshot.
---
I dont think it's unlikely to end up around that number regardless if you gear for it. DFT + lionheart + Titanic is already 6% hit, add to that onslaught and strikers mark that definitely won't be replaced until naxx and you're at 8%. Perhaps there are som Good alternatives to DFT for warrs tho since HS queueing reduces its value so much.
---
love
---
I think this is a thing?
---
    /petautocasttoggle SpellName
---
I get the point you’re trying to make, but comparing camping in a game to homophobia in a country is probably not the best thing to do.  I’d go with a different example personally before you have however many people in this sub jump down your throat.
---
Just a fyi... Befor u turn in ur furbolg costum and complete the quest delete it amd get it back from the quest guy.. Now u have deleted it u can restore the item after u turn it in for the mace.. Then u have both!!
---
&gt;The problem in WoW classic at the moment is simply, to be blunt, that rules are dumb/broken
---
Saying something negative about classic on this sub?  
---
THATS 50 DKP MINUS!
---
It is a coincidence. This started when spy was nerfed forcing more addons to use the hidden chat channels. This is what blew up the chat usage. I am sure honorspy becoming more used contributed but alone they are not the issue.
---
crazy to think this is the 'average' player
---
&gt; how the fuck could it possibly be proven?
---
see video in OP
---
It's turbulent times. Such is war.
---
The alliance is under great stress. We need to swell our ranks, not our eyes!
---
But seriously. Alliance has always been a underdog faction on PvP servers. Since the start. 
---
Even in battlegrounds, except AV, they would wipe the floor with alliance.
---
What’s somewhat humorous about that vid is that, while he is raging you can faintly hear in the background the song Don’t Worry, Be Happy.
---
Does that provide info on the zones throughout the world? Like the combat levels on monsters in the area, what the monsters drop, etc? 
---
I played OSRS so that’s what I’m kinda used to
---
The problem with #nochanges is that _we started the game with a ton of changes_. It didn't really fit when we had super high server pops, realm layering, patch 1.12 starting out with a weird rollout of content, spell batching was weird and other things they decided to change.
---
Zandalar Tribe is highly recommended. Great communities on both sides and covers all content of the game (RP-PVP).
---
No its not? They are strong AF but they don't dominate every zone
---
How about you and your friends also start doing something by yourself and at least roll ally alts on a different unbalanced realm?
---
Faction transfers are not coming and you perfectly know that, "fight for your faction" is such a hypocrite claim.
---
OMFG so good
---
believe it or not actual pvp players usually go alliance for the quicker queues, they told these people ages before launch that its cross realm so they went horde for the better racials, its not that hard to understand..its a combination of things obviously
---
this is awesome. cry is free. go to PVE
---
yikes ...
---
You might need threat on 3 different mobs.  HS is a more rare spell so you can to put it somewhere
---
There have been a lot of warnings about what is bound to happen, and it happened. 
---
I mean, regardless the faction imbalance even: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/ look
---
Blizzard have predicted and accounted the heavy loss of playerbase in: they have mentioned it even before the Classic launch.
---
It's very important to understand though, current shitshow is the result of one faction severely dominating over another. Another faction is unhappy and sad but all their woes come from the fact they are literal minority and that's unlikely to expect Blizzard to fix it themselves, especially if most fixes imply screwing the majority over it.
---
Yup. The average player today is as knowledgeable about the meta and shit as the elites were in Vanilla.
---
Not true at all, just not, you know what happens when range dps pull mobs? The dps "kite" right? Wrong they vanish feign death or Frost Nova and the mob is now next to the healer and smacking the shit out him/her. Get off your high horse and stop messing up the plan.
---
Details may tell me when I’m close to exceeding the tank’s threat, but it does not tell me when a mob is targeting me.
---
You don’t think they are to going to see you come back in 15 secs?
---
That's not how it worked back in the days and not how it should work now.
---
That is not an easy fix at all. People aoe farming in the world could get easily griefed by lvl 1s. Not a smart solution at all. Only way I see to 'fix the problem' is to make grays non atackable
---
&gt; Would we say that the winner was immoral or that the rules of the game are simply dumb?
---
It's not either or, it's both.
---
I was just saying that regardless of the intent, someone camping you is going to see it as a ragelog.
---
Current servers hold 10k or something.
---
If anyone asked me, my advice to tanks would be to pull at their discretion but they better be aware of what they're pulling and how the group's mana is (that is healer and mage primarily). If it's an easy pull they can do whatever people will sit and drink for 20 more seconds and he should be fine. If it's a hard one they should wait for like 80% mana or even full in a very paranoid situation.
---
I absolutely hate tanks that wait when there's no need for waiting and you have to tell them to pull repeatedly.
---
I also understand that it's a hard job and you have to learn somehow and people will blame you for most things. There's a reason I didn't start a tank yet, I get lost in dungeons, don't exactly know what comes at every pull (there's some sketchy pulls in most instances), and also don't know mobs abilities, well some but not well enough to call targets and cc properly...
---
Yup.
---
The level of misinformation being spread by people is ridiculous.
---
The solution is already in the game just turn off your PVP flag :)
---
You have to read tea leaves on every group and hope you can figure the groove out quickly.
---
“brb guys, my wifes boyfriend is giving me shit”

Paladin is designed with noobs in mind. No attacks just swinging the melee. Lots of utility to save you from a fuck up.

---
git gud lol
---
I believe it and that's the reason why I expect queues for the Horde to be pretty manageable as well. BG-wise Alliance is going to be a king in classic and I am sure there were a lot of people who rolled Alliance for the sake of BGs without any intention to be an honor livestock, so they rolled PVE realms in the first place.
---
Perhaps shove your genius comment up your arse. You have no arguments so you mock me.
---
Dude, you have taunt exactly for that reason, besides mob is more often than not frost novaed exactly so healer can move away and give a chance for the tank to get them back off the healer.
---
Why do people make these claims without ANY proper evidence?
---
First, Blizzard wasn't crystal clear on the server caps (limited number of concurrent players at a given time), but nothing indicates that the server cap is a lot more than 3-4k (aka vanilla caps). Look up blue posts related to this matter. If they said anything, then it's that they want to keep original server caps (this blue post referred to layers since it was posted at that time).
---
Check primetime how many players are in the end game zones. As an example, I play on one of the bigger EU pvp realms and yesterday the number of people in felwood were between 15 and 45. This wont up add to 10k concurrent players lol.. (heck I've even seen people claiming here that server caps are 20k... like wtf).
---
Second, total population (i.e. total characters created on the realm) shouldn't directly affect wpvp, it only affects things like AH prices.
---
Please stop repeating false statements.
---
No it wasn't like that in Vanilla. Liar.
---
Clearly not judging by the number of "muh PVP" griefers
---
You have both a GF and a wife? You live in Utah?
---
"proof that your character is unplayable"
---
You said classic was unplayable. Not that your char was unplayable.  
---
But it's not really proof of anything like that anyway.    
---
It's just an option, if you aren't enjoying your main or your realm, then play another one.
---
The people that are camping beyond the first couple kills aren't doing it for honor anyway, I don't think this would change anything. Someone in a 15 minute queue that wants to play in the mean times is still going to go gank.
---
Because he's a ''Twitch Partner Professional Classic wow/OSRS Player''. Obviously.
---
They probably just have no idea what the DRs are at/aren't sure, why not kill you? I'm sure they are motivated by honor primarily
---
I dont think its needed.
---
The important things in the Holyspecc are 0,5 faster cast on greater heal and 15% mana reduction. Since thats your main healing spell.
---
Everything else as increased healing is just nice to have.
---
At least for dungeons, it should be enough to drink often.
---
??? Go on pve server than ?
---
That doesn’t help if they don’t know that.
---
&gt;It was, and it will forever be.
---
I disagree. Douchebags have always existed. Hell I can be one sometimes. But it wasn't the anticipated and expected behavior of everyone on the internet.
---
&gt;This is a goddamn roleplaying videogame. When I get killed I wasnt brutally murdered or abused. People are playing withing the rules of the game I chose to play.
---
You're misreading what I'm saying or just not understanding it at all.
---
Me getting killed in a gank is not what I'm talking about. 
---
People deathballing despite having enormous evidence that it's decimating server populations on the faction that isn't in the majority. Everyone knows it's burning peoples interest in the game, but there isn't a big push for self correction.  'this problem is bigger than me, so I might as well just benefit'.
---
I believe that it's possible for game populations to self-police, they just have to believe that they can.  Vanilla wow back in the day didn't have this issue despite being a nearly identical game.
---
Server populations aren't actually that large, it's effectively boycott behavior what I'm talking about, which is difficult to do when you're one amongst millions, but server popualtions are only a few thousand.  Guilds can get together and put a stop to deathballing.  If they want to preserve the game and its community, because they love it, it'll be worth it to do.  Even if it fails, it'll be worth it to try.
---
Depending on whether bgs will be cross faction. Twinking will not be thesame as it was back in the day.
---
Lol, yeah, Alli never camp Horde. And the only reason they do it sometimes is to get revenge. And the only reason Horde do it is because we’re abusive 😂😂 give me a break dude.
---
The minor comes from the goblin with the ogre body guard that walks inbetween tarren mill n hillsbrad?? Its on a long spawn timer tho.. Or is that ally only even tho he is a netural vendor
---
The best part of Classic was launch through August. Once the mafias and the try hards got established, it's been downhill.
---
On Herod, even though Horde has a higher population, you will find that Blackrock Mtn and Dire Maul are regularly camped by a huge Alliance deathball. Every single day. Faction imbalance isn't 100% of the story.
---
60 dungeons are all pretty much pack pulling. Usually only about 3 elites per pack you have to focus on. Just don’t over pull and you’ll be fine.
---
Fire resist yo
---
Wtf you mean it’s got me 8k gold and has salty dogs like you mad af haha
---
Any evidence to back that up? This:
---
 [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4408\_Faerlina](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4408_Faerlina) 
---
... and the people who actually played the game in 2004-6 on high pop servers suggest otherwise.
---
Prebis should be enough, but you will fuck up and die to the firelords and Anger several times until you really get it down. 
---
You’re gonna need to invest gold in preparation items for the runs anyway, I highly, highly suggest wheeling and dealing with friends or even strangers to get them to help you. 
---
The loot drops are valuable vendor items, Anger drops a weapon that sells for almost 5G among other good loot drops. If you tell people you’ll pass drops to them, or even offer tips I guarantee with a bit of effort you’ll get people to run it with you, especially within your guild. 
---
I passed a few drops to a healer guildie that ran 10 runs with me and he made over 45g in those 10 runs. 
---
So yeah, you may have to be social and negotiate a little bit, but IMHO it’s doable and less frustrating than the solo run as a Rogue, not to mention more efficient.
---
Everything except DM-North can easily be tanked with a level similar to the mobs in there.
---
DM-north has some groups of very hard hitting mobs. So you either have a group with good CC or you get some better armor. I did not feel well there as a bear without the 2 armor-trinkets and the armor-weapon.
---
"OSRS Player"
---
"3-tick barbarian fishing"
---
But even that wasn't the original lol
---
Rogue is not overrepresented. Warriors and mages are the most popular classes in WoW classic. 
---
Also, play what you like, it doesn't matter what others are doing.
---
Phase 1 prehonor would be a great default state.
---
Lol this guy is so triggered by the truth that he attempts to mock it. 😂
---
This is the discussion, they go over the build here (Around 8 minutes in).  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3crp7UlbrI&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3crp7UlbrI&amp;t=)
---
Can’t change the mind of a fool I suppose
---
Didn't know about that one, thanks
---
People still crying about this?
---
Yes, that's what I meant, can't port from Lothos.
---
My third Jinta`alor party in Hinterlands just broke midway cause of lvl60 gank...
---
shit is getting really tiring, might just stick to raid-logging if that ...
---
I believed in Vanilla that leveling as a prot warrior would be fun.
---
I rolled on a PvP server because I enjoy PvP. I've ganked and have been ganked. I've put a Corruption dot in a low level player to see if they survive, and I've been mawled by a high level hunter's pet while he was hiding. I've had fights on fights on fights on the control of a contested farming spot. That's why I rolled on a PvP server, because I enjoy PvP.
---
When you roll on a PvP server, and coming back to the first formulation of Kant's categorical imperative, there are universal laws that you accept beforehand. Because you behave that way, and are okay with that behaviour becoming a universal law. But I'd like to think I'm not absolutely out of my mind when I suppose that negating someone the ability to play a game they're paying for (in certain, dire situations, like a recent video about a BRD run became infamous for, for example) is not someone everyone wishes to become the norm.
---
well you are talking semantics.  You need to be able to play your character to play classic.  So what you are saying is if you cannot play your char on one realm move to another.  While this is a possibility, there are other choices like just quitting the game.  The balance will not get better and you will be at a 90/10 faction.  I guess if that is what people want.
---
If you take this ring from the ony head over the neck as a melee dps you are very dumb.  Regardless of the fire resist.
---
Oh look it’s a PvE elitist!
---
Didn't want to deal with legions of the literal South Park guy while trying to quest or get to raids, so I didn't roll on a PvP server. 
---
The neckbeards you're describing won't be reading this and will never change. They existed back then too but they've only gotten more extreme and numerous over time. 
---
In fact, I would say this kind of post literally excites them, the notion that they've upset someone enough to post about it or even better, to quit, is something they relish. They think it's great. 
---
I want my interaction with these 'people' to be exactly zero, and it is. I never, ever have to deal with them, and it is **so much better**. 
---
If I want to PvP, BGs will fill that role much better, as my interest world "PvP" (aka ganks or zergs 95% of the time without any skill or coordination involved) is less than zero.
---
Yikes.
---
Love how you have nothing to say about how you were wrong about us outnumbering them.  I had no idea a youtube video about a couple guys on a boat farming honor could make you so mad, I apologize.
---
I’m laughing so hard because the only reason you were downvoted is this information totally invalidates the “OMG Horde bad Alliance pity party” narrative on this sub.
---
I'm sure that everyone posting here with the exception of the op is on the unbalanced side of all of this. Corpse run every aspect of the map every time you land is complete bulldhit. If bgs dont fix it... I'm out. Going to go play ultima online. A real pvp game.
---
I never notice when that debuff is on them somehow
---
If you have mining farming rich thorium nodes in the Silithus tunnels can be a good option depending on your server.
---
&gt;the size of the server populations.
---
This is a big deal though. Again, lets just say for the sake of argument that most servers are 3:2 Horde favored. Scale that up to a properly sized server and it means that fights would be like 100 vs 70 or so. Which is..manageable, not to mention 6v4 is easily winnable and so is like 30 vs 20 or 40 vs 30. What isn't manageable is when 3:2 becomes 300 vs 200, you cannot overcome a deficit of 100 people in pvp. It's too much of an avalanche.
---
Being a ganking psycho is much more healthier than someone who truly expects this high philosophy bullshit in a childish game.
---
Sarcasm eludes you my friend
---
Mining the caves in Silithus
---
Why would a PvP focused Rogue roll Ally?
---
ironforge.pro has fairly decent data. Some of the bigger servers have ~9k players. That's a lot bigger than vanilla servers.
---
The sound of a mind shutting down.
---
I do if I'm camping a FP or trying to kill people in Gadgetzan lol. But yeah in the open world on someone who just rezzed deff not using detect magic.
---
Not even remotly as unfair as priest. Target..Mindvision... even when like 7Km away, in an underwater cave...I see youu.....
---
What server are you on? Whould gladly help out. Dont post your ign here tho cuz people might see it as an invitation to camp you even more
---
Details. Only shows you talents of people with details though.
---
Imagine being this fucking dumb
---
I dont see a problem
---
That’s a huge assumption, and sounds like comes from jealousy. People are people yo
---
imagine having so little self-esteem IRL that this is how you choose to exercise the tiniest possible amount of power in a virtual space
---
do your job, press your buttons, win the game, stuff the drama
---
Phase 2 has had so many people quit Classic it’s not funny. PVP should be tough but do we want pserver levels of toxicity to drive off others who want to experience the game? What happens when only toxic arseholes are left.
---
my man 😍
---
I thought 1 heal = .5 threat?
---
People gank honorless targets all day anyways. Won't fix the problem.
---
&gt; Who gives a fuck about someone's name unless it is actually hateful.
---
The gatekeeping is crazy
---
Child molestation name "joke" (where is the joke actually? please explain) is kay
---
Hateful names are not
---
Big yikes indeed
---
you sure it works for honorless too? I can see debuffs but it doesn't work for honorless for some reason. Using ElvUI as well
---
No potions or hp pots. Budget paper
---
That pve experience.
---
Phase 1 wPvP was nothing like a PvE server.
---
Stop being so obtuse.
---
At first I thought by HK you meant Hong Kong.
---
Glimmerin Mithril Insignia at level 40.
---
&gt;Like for example, it's not unethical to score a goal against your opponent team in soccer even if it makes the other team unhappy.
---
It is unethical to keep scoring if your team is winning 10-0 by the end of the first half, namely when talking about rec league level.
---
Can't disagree with what you're saying though. You can't punish people for playing within the rules of the game. You can't expect people in a community this large and diverse to self police outside of isolated microcosms.
---
why do you need a macro for this lol
---
Does the counterweight affect your bear form attack speed?
---
By the time P2 rolled around people have 60’s already. Some very geared 60’s. Some multiple 60’s. Some people have grown close with their guild. They are reluctant to go to a PVE server and cut their connections from the old server. I dont really see starting fresh as an option.
---
That being said there is no PVP to PVE server transfers at the moment i dont believe.
---
I'm assuming you mean raid specs? If so, it's very very hard to make a case for any other spec.
---
Much of the problem comes down to Imp Shadow Bolt. This skill is a huge boost to warlock dps, and is a shared resource between all warlocks in the raid. So there's an appeal to stacking crit gear since you want 100% uptime of this debuff. Otherwise even if you can personally put up better numbers by stacking +shadow dmg gear, you're still reducing the total lock dps. So since you're stacking crit gear, and Bane is a must, you may as well push all the way to Ruin. So with a fixed 21 in destro, you now need some Shadow damage buff, which leaves you with DS or SM as your choices.
---
Soul Link/NF is a build people have looked at, the idea being a SL'ed succu is still +13% to your shadow damage and you get the pet damage, but pets can be difficult to keep alive in encounters and you're guild would have to clear a slot for your corruption so that the occasional NF proc would make up for the loss of Bane. And best of all, pets don't even scale, so you're not going to scale as well as any other build.
---
Nightflag is actually a decent build if you're mainly running 20 man raids and is far better for trash clear speed or when you need to burst down something like the Emps bugs or C'thuns tenticles. You still have Imp SB, Bane, and Ruin, but you also have the opion to burst really hard, bug you give up 10% to your shadow bolt damage, which is a huge loss to your sustain dps.
---
This is where some changes imported from TBC would have been amazing.
---
I’ve tanked zf with 2 hand only between 46-50. We never had any wipes I only pugged. No need to get shield for ZF. I heard that instances above 50 are much harder.
---
GM's have literally said "Get your own cross faction alliance" so no it is not.
---
I do it as SM/Ruin without any problems, very smoth each time. Have been doing it even when I didn't have much gear.
---
If horde :Do the hinterlands elites for rune of the guard captain.  Do the first part of the Onyxia attunement for Blackhand’s breath.  Bingo 2 easy to get trinkets that do not take up a debuff slot.
---
I can survive it but it sucks to see so many people quit the game. I don’t blame the bigger faction, they are desperate to gain honor points and can’t do much else.  If honor is only in BGs they don’t get to have to farm in the world.
---
I'm an alliance on whitemane I think you're just a salty weak cunt

Once you get high enough level for BRD you can go for [Impervious Giant](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11921/impervious-giant#comments)
---
Gives ~108 armor in Dire Bear Form, 1% hit and 2% crit.
---
Get a blacksmith to apply an Iron Counterweight for the 3% attack speed increase as it actually works in Bear/Cat form.
---
Problem is that she generates no threat and even resets it.  If your lock is not tanking she's not that great.
---
1% hit is slightly more than 1% dps increase, yeah?
---
its a false statement, How many are quitting ? where are the numbers.....
---
Yes the healer knows that your high speed pulls require spamming a consumables resource that costs gold most of the time, and getting 20% of it's benefit, becuase otherwise they'll rum out of mana and be blamed for not healing enough. You see it as the healer meeting your expectations and the healer sees it as doing everything shirt of spamming Mana pots to keep from wiping. Of course we'll do that too sometimes, healers will blow 3 gold just trying to bandaid the messed up pull where aggro is everywhere and extra packs are being pulled.
---
&gt;Been that way forever.
---
I'm not sure that's the case. Estimates from honor addons show about 4,000 Horde and 4,200 Alliance on my server. There are more high level PvPers on one faction on my Classic server than all players combined on my old Vanilla server.
---
The overall population density is at least twice as high, and given how many 60s already have MC on farm, it feels very crowded in high level zones.
---
I'm not exactly sure, but I don't think addons can see what beneficial effects an enemy has without detect magic. So there would be no way for the addon to detect when some1 uses fear ward for example. Maybe some1 figures out a workaround
---
I think free server transfers are a good  idea - but they should be limited to a certain faction if the balance is way off. I play on a server that was slightly alliance favoured - and while it's nowhere near as bad as other servers it's now filled with allies from other large horde dominated servers.
---
I don't think stuff like this should exist. A warrior knowing when to use a cd to give him maximum effectiveness (which includes  ruining your fear attempt) whould not be countered by a simple addon. In general, using abilities is about strategic timing,  but that relies alot of if the enemy knows about it. 
---
Anyway, other comments seem to have your answer. Just my 2 cents.
---
I mean honestly if the servers had the same population that they had back in vanilla this issue wouldn't be.
---
Jumper cables
---
Leveling my alt before I hit 49 you can already see this trend on PvP Servers. 1-20 was still popular, but after 20 it was all down hill. Took a few days to find a Gnomer Group. SM was close to impossible, RFD I got lucky and ran into a generous 60. ZF is still very popular, but Maraudon and ST are becoming harder to find/get groups. The real drop though happens at 49 because you're now a prime target for the roaming death squads who will 100% camp your body till their "scout" finds the next group of players.
---
While what you say may be true, absolutely nothing about the situation is *forcing* people to play the way they are.  They could, at any point in time, acknowledge that the toon they are camping 10 times on its way to BRD is in fact controlled by an actual human being on the other end that is simply being griefed uncontrollably while they're just trying to play the game, and they could choose act in a way that is considerate of that fact.  But they don't, because what I think all the situation really demonstrates yet again, is that the video gaming community is by and large incredibly toxic and full of anti-social, sociopathic people.  It's a community filled with people incapable or unmotivated to accomplish anything of note in real life, so they take the easy route of aiming to become elite in a simplified fantasy world.
---
You haven't understood what I said. I mean what are you going to bet on "this guy hasn't updated his addon since Blizzard broke it (and others like it) back in September"?
---
I'm surprised Frost parroted such an easily disproven theory tbh
---
Yea! Ask the few Alliance left to form a raid! Only for the Horde to literally put together a raid 5 times larger in a matter of seconds and obliterate them. Good plan.
---
Thank you. I just started leveling a druid (level 16) and my knowledge regarding them is fairly low.
---
Couldn't they just follow you until the honorless buff wears off?
---
Who shit in your cereal this morning?
---
Since so many people here played in Vanilla or pservers, I've noticed a thick stench of elitism where everyone talks down to each other because "ive done this all before" ... or even worse, because they read a wowhead guide, or looked up a BiS list.
---
I know of a dozen personal friends who have quit Classic because of phase 2. I hate that they are gone. A whole guild I was acquaintanced with left to play Diablo. 
---
I’m also hearing more of the same from other sources, other players on the servers I play on, facebook and so on. 
---
Easy come easy go but the question is if phase 2 was on a 3000 person server would they still be playing??? I think so.
---
No, they aren’t. We raided yesterday and they were most certainly camping Alliance raids trying to MC all throughout Blackrouck Mountain. I’m a Priest so I thought I’d be sneaky and jump into the lava and shield. Turns out there was literally an entire raid in the lava killing people who jumped. And it was at the very least 4 raids total. And I only saw from the ‘back entrance’, down the lava and through the window. But chat had a 2-3 minute delay. Three people kept getting instantly blown up in the window. We started about an hour later than usual. Two guys ended up rage quitting. We obviously couldn’t replace them. 
---
I think I made it in seven runs or so. Got Eye, tho.
---
You know you can just keybind all the raid markers to any keys right? Doesn’t have to be macroed or take a spot on an action bar. I just use my F keys for this.
---
haha funny joke
---
I use my heals/shield on the numbers (1-6).  Then when shadow I had mind blast F, SW:P c, mind flay e, psychic scream q, silence x, wand r, then misc with shift / alt
---
for something like this? are you by chance a black overweight female currently starring in any hollywood production in need of a stereotype?
---
I was kidding.... obviously he didn't provide any real proof.
---
This is the best solution for balance ratio so far on this sub
---
Arena was the answer. Bring arena to classic. System is way more realistic to reach top ranks
---
Of course not, i was just riffing on the server name.
---
Bloodfang.
---
Top.
---
As a horde on stonespine, whichever dungeon I go to or wherever I go I get camped and ganked. Feeling is mutual and it's crap but it's what I signed up for! It's normal for me and doesn't ruin my day
---
They will kill you anyway.
---
I know it helps you feel better to just insult those folks that camp brm.  But really these are just high end guilds who are bored between Mc runs.  Not everyone is manchildren dude.  Myself and my guild were camping brm the last night, we have cardiac doctors, teachers, construction workers, bankers, lawyers etc. And not all of these are male. We have like 5 girls in that group. 
---
Perhaps you're just salty because youre getting spanked? Maybe go to a different zone bud.
---
Of course. That's what I'm saying.
---
Colluding?   What is this Russia probe?   It's a game.   If two guilds want to get together to farm honor oh well.   Don't like it?   Play a PVE server.   Christ guys.   Start a witch Hunt.   Try and publicly shame players because they are using a game mechanic
---
0/10  
---
Roll PVE k thx bye
---
You can do this by logging out while dead then logging back in and respawning. Instant honorless buff, but you still might end up dead.
---
How about fun? I want this shit to be fun. This shit blows for everyone
---
oh cmon. vanilla NEVER had anything like the state of BRM and the surrounding zones right now.  
---
There was always the "lets meet up at TP and run down as a raid, and pvp a bit. maybe 1 or 2 deaths on your way in as you clashed with another guild.  what's happening right now is nothing remotely resembling that. 
---
entire zones being hk farmed at a 30-1 imbalance. It's almost comical.
---
Pagle byfar

1) If you wait a moment too long, someone's gonna start yelling at you for that instead.

Leave tanks alone. We're angry and stressed out as fuck already from having to tank for randoms who neither know nor care how threat works, so we're gonna pull the way that makes our lives the least infuriating and you will learn to like it.

Can I heal raids with HOTW/NS
---
I don't get why you don't get this de/buff after ressing...
---
That is actually an interesting analogy.
---
Dude, if an account of a horde player is deleted he will just create another. I suggest you write a petition to your parliament proposing a law horde players should be banned from internet completely to prevent them playing ever.
---
Since the population will most likely be slowly diminishing over the first 6 months or so there will probably not be. You will more likely see server mergers then new servers. Maybe there will be a influx on some phase release, but I doubt it
---
lol just start randomly converting horde toons to alliance without saying anything
---
&gt;Second, total population (i.e. total characters created on the realm) shouldn't directly affect wpvp, it only affects things like AH prices.
---
It kinda does, apparently. The server isn't well sharded and divided like it is in retail, despite being backed up with modern servers.
---
I obviously have nothing strict on merit, but i read between various posts that server load is affected by number of people and that load increases esponentially when said people interact with each other, and by interact i also mean merely looking at each other.
---
Having more people on a server means having more unique interactions between players, hence it increases server load. It's not lnear, and it's not always the same. Even if the whole server isn't in a place, the sparse interaction across all the server do ( and this takes in account servers, not realms, so kalimdor and eastern kingdoms are handled differently and so are instances).
---
That said, i don't have nothing like links or so to back me up now, so i might have taken something differently than it is.

One of these things are not like the other.

Last I heard these were faction limited to the larger faction on most servers.
---
You basically rolled a zandalari
---
They are worth lots of gold because they increase caster dps. Stat sticks aren't as useful. Wands with any sort of spell damage are rare.
---
Horde account $15 and your $15 are the same in blizzards eye. They don’t give a fuck
---
No, I mean servers where wPvP is not a gankfest 24/7 that you can't do anything. I know it doesn't look like it when looking at this sub, but they do exist. Why would Blizzard remove honor from wPvP on those and on PvE servers? Since I doubt they would remove it for them, I doubt they'd remove it for any server.
---
Low effort editing. First WF onehit should be in sync with the guitar starting in the Linkin Park song.
---
there’s an addon that does this just like retail
---
As part of that community you’ll have to deal with the fact not all of us want to be or accept toxic arseholery in our game.
---
No he won't, he will ice block and the healer will die and everyone loses.
---
Ganking horde down voted my posts. Doesn't like people yo highlight the reality of the state of classic right now.
---
What's to fix? The people who get the most honor get rewarded. You get the most honor by killing players of the opposing faction as much and as often as possible.
---
&gt; If you were only using this to prove that the population is greater than 3-4k cited above 
---
I am. The data looks pretty wild because of several factors - people that have it installed, time of day used, the fact that it was broken for a while etc. Regardless of all that it's been able to consistently pick up just shy of 6k concurrent on a popular server like Faerlina.
---
Criticism is pointless because everyone *knows* the flaws with vanilla's system. But they aren't going to change, so if you have problems with how the game currently is, then you simply don't like the game.
---
it was never important.
---
as the OP pointed out: his fire resistance potion lasted all of P1 (with 0 fr)... meaning there's very little to no FR damage going out ( on non-tank).
---
people were just moron back then , saw a big fire elemental boss and assumed the more FR the better.
---
This is a million gold idea I'm going to email this to Ion right now.
---
My fingers hurt too. Elwynn is alliance controlled sooo don’t be flagged also get good
---
I love pvp. I wanted to play on a pvp server just like vanilla. 
---
I won't get to do that until BG's come out. 
---
Unfortunately many of my friends have quit the game as a result of the current state of it.   
---
I'm at the point where I wake up at 3am, run into whatever instance i plan on running later that day after work, and log out there.   It's still several death runs to get in, but it's less than 18-20 death runs. 
---
when BGs come out this will all settle. Just hope we don't lose even more alliance players making the imbalance even worse
---
0 chance of death... yeah say that to resisted vanishes lol
---
Oh agreed - its one of the reasons I regret not sticking with my druid but shammy so fun it dont matter
---
Yeah
---
It's annoying because priests are always overwriting my fort buffs with their own in raids because they think theirs is better since the tooltip is wrong on their end.
---
First Aid 300
---
I don’t understand why people think they can get away with this sort of thing in this day and age. Everything it’s recording these days.
---
Oof, based on the downvotes I completely overestimated the community. Basic stat values aren't common knowledge I guess? This is one of those questions you could ask in guild chat and save the hours of testing OP did.
---
If this is new to you and want to learn more, I recommend next reading up on spell coefficients and how these stats work with different spells.
---
Dude, nice video!! is your FD freeze trap macro working? Or do you do it manually? Seems like that is key for crowd control as a hunter in PVP but I can’t seem to get to work right
---
In my experience, sometimes the other player’s tooltip is correct, and sometimes it isn’t. A Pally tank friend of mine has improved BoW, and it never shows up right on my screen.
---
Bro my daughter was born 2 months ago while I was level 34 leveling in Desolace. The first night I couldn't sleep(because I was afraid she'd stop breathing) so you better believe I whipped out the laptop and grinded xp for two hours.
---
And here we are, it's been two months and I'm clearing Molten core every week as a newborn parent.
---
You can be a new dad and play wow, too.
---
It isn't hypocritical to want it banned but still use it. It would be hypocritical to say that no one should use the addon right now, that it makes you a bad person, and then use it. There is a difference. One is a judgment on the person and the act itself, and one is arguing for a rule change. To argue that the rules should be changed does not preclude you from playing by the existing rules. 
---
If I believe this addon leads to a playing experience that is worse than if it were banned, I might advocate to make that ban. However, while it is legal, there is nothing gained by not using it. You reference a feedback loop in which the more that people use it, the more it creates incentive for others to use it, but the existence of this loop does nothing to make an individual's use of it hypocritical. It is, in fact, the main reason to ban it.
---
This and not to mention the bosses were overtuned in the beginning leading to blizz nerfing raid bosses so they curve was able to complete the raid aswell
---
No I’m pretty sure the coding still exists in Retail as well.
---
They should add flying mounts so people can avoid pvp even on pvp servers.
---
And add a place to fight in small groups, call it arenas.
---
And remove the honor system entirely so there's no point to BGs anymore, even though BGs arent even out yet.
---
Hard to enjoy life when you’re always tilted over a game. 
---
You guys are the real joke. Just shut the game off and chill out. It’s not hard, and it’ll be there tomorrow.
---
Good point. Are there currently any PvP servers that aren’t a wpvp toxic mess atm. Would removing honor from wpvp so they had to farm it in BGs really inconvenience them.
---
https://twitter.com/heylauragao/status/1199392767593435141
---
Everybody who chooses to play on a PVP server does have to carry some responsibility for their choice, though. And the alternative is there, PVE servers like where I play, no ganking, no farming, just consensual PVP when you want to flag yourself.
---
And that's not victim-blaming either! Yes, honor farming is not an intended consequence and is questionably ethical or moral! However, on a personal level, one must make a decision to continue to play on a PVP server and endure that (a choice that nobody but one's self can make), or to reroll on a PVE server and avoid it.
---
"But I've invested so much time into this character!!1!" So what? That's sunk cost fallacy. If you log in today and spend 30 minutes of relative hell struggling to stay alive long enough to mount away or catch a griffon elsewhere, how is that "investment" worth anything? Compared to the ability to spend that same 30 minutes playing an alt for the time being, on a PVE server, and deriving joy from every minute of that game play, continuing on a PVP hellhole because of the sunk cost in that character is a bad investment.
---
Step back. Breathe. Remember, you play games to have fun. If you're not having fun, put the PVP toons on the back burner, roll PVE, start having fun, have a pint, and let this whole thing blow over.
---
Yes that is true. I didn't want to clarify it even more above because it already was a wall of text.
---
Stronger than T1 in most cases 
---
Almost as strong as T1 in some cases
---
I didn't even mean T1 I meant to say Raid gear tbh. Most good raid gear is non-set stuff which really boosts damage.
---
But T1 is good for PVP for most classes :D A lot of stats ;)
---
idk about your server, but man, i LOVE pvp, and this shit is trash right now. Had a few guildies quit the game over it. I honestly don't think it's the moral quandary the OP posted... but the community is behaving in a way that could kill servers that are imbalanced pop.
---
Basically, I'm trying to farm stuff for my profession instead of buying from the AH. Currently, I'm trying to kill these stupid dust devils in Westfall.  I found this map on the internet but it'd be real helpful if there was an add on so I could see the info on my map. Is there an add-on for that?
---
yes i'm sure all of those heart surgeons, rocket scientists, and nuclear physicists have nothing better to do than sit on a 13 year old game and grief other players for 12 hours a day
---
&gt;Criticism is pointless because everyone knows the flaws with vanilla's system
---
There is a lot of discussion that could be had over problems vanilla has. Just because it may not result in change, doesn't mean it isn't at all productive or even interesting. I also have a feeling that honor may actually get changed if there is enough subscriber drop-off even after BGs release.
---
&gt;you simply don't like the game
---
It is possible to not like some parts of a game and still like the game overall.
---
Every single one of these, except maybe spellcleave, happened on a large scale in vanilla. Extreme min/max probably wasn't quite as effective due to lack of knowledge but it still happened on an ongoing basis with patches.
---
&gt; So I have 0% mana, I throw renew on tank.
---
And now you've pulled aggro since tank hasnt had time to aoe threat.
---
Yeah, I’m pvp spec and of vanish is resisted, and I have to blow prep. That’s still 3.5 minutes I have to wait for vanish to come back up. Since the chance for pickpocket to be resisted isn’t high. But it’s not worth the risk to die and run back.
---
Ethics are defined by the majority population, not by some random person on Reddit. Imagine a culture that thinks trees are living beings, and killing them is akin to murder. Are we, as a society that chops down trees by the millions, suddenly unethical because some other society says we are for actions we see as entirely normal? To us, trees aren't living and therefore aren't deserving of humane treatment.
---
You can't force your own set of morals and ethics on other societies, that just isn't how it works. You say ethics are entirely personal, but you then judge and condemn others in the very same thought for being different than you. To those people you're judging, you're the unethical one.
---
Be happy you live in a society where homophobia is considered unethical. Not everyone is so lucky.
---
Ive found the opposite. I normally have to tell them its cool to pull while im drinking. 
---
I use to tank but DPS seem to hate the calm, cool, and collected.
---
I kind of enjoy tanking pugs for the excitement.  It's unpredictable and you have to be pretty alert, and it can be a good sense of accomplishment when you keep the group alive from constant nooby DPS plays and pulls.    Though it gets stressful sometimes..
---
I like healing too cos it's generally way more relaxing and stress free.
---
Hunters and mages make super good alts because they are gold generators at 60
---
Worth it.
---
What if, hear me out guys: If honorless targets actually was Negative honor.
---
Yes there are. I am on Whitemane atm and it's fine. Yes there are ganks, yes sometimes you land from a FP and you die, but it's not like we get camped 24/7. I can manage just fine 90% of the time. I can even meet some Horde that won't attack me 3v1.
---
And removing honor from wPvP on a PvP WOULD be an inconvenience. We rolled PvP to do wPvP and participate in the honor system. I sympathize with people on imba servers, I really do. I simply don't think removing honor is a real solution nor a probable one. I simply wish faction balance was better.
---
Losers.
---
You're welcome! Encouraging discussion and observation is a healthy thing to do, especially in a group where people give thoughtful answers and contribute to the discussion
---
One tick will be just fine.
---
Why are you PVP flagged in IF on your bank alt?
---
What do you mean? Really want a full description? I aoe when 4 or more mobs, usually single target when 3 or less, but since I play a mage I tend to use cone of cold on cd with 3 targets as well, may use it with 2 as well. Meanwhile frostbolt marked targets, or just try and assist on the one that goes down faster/ is dangerous and low hp like many casters. Depends on the situation. What does this have to do with pulling aggro? That doesn't happen only with aoe. When Aoe I don't expect tank to keep full aggro, but try their best to mitigate incoming damage or I die fast and then the rest has to single target say 10 mobs and then res me which is probably a lot less fun for them than it is for me to watch, and that's no fun either.
---
If you're pvping and raiding, the optimal pvp spec is almost always different than the optimal raid spec for every class, so that's 100g each week in respec costs alone. Agree with everything else you said though.
---
Ofcourse they care, they Wana farm honor.
---
PvP campers are sociopaths, it's really that simple.
---
There is no objective moral truth. Stop being so judgemental and play the game for what it is. The same rules apply to everyone so stop trying to apply moral judgments to it.
---
Lol thanks!
---
I think he was making a joke and not mocking you... i guess your name is appropriate 😅
---
Their whole spec is jacked
---
new video series i'm working on, let me know what you guys think about it :)
---
Funny. Meth harbor is death to alliance most times. The horde just gank on boats as a group of 4 or so most days. And because of boat mechanics you cant stop them. Free easy rez every trip.
---
&gt; When you roll on a PvP server, and coming back to the first formulation of Kant's categorical imperative, there are universal laws that you accept beforehand. 
---
Assuming your personal code of ethics aligns with's Kant's
---
This is definitely worth it.
---
The key difference being that battlegrounds contained a huge portion of the honor farming back in Vanilla, which we haven't had for the last few weeks. Hopefully things simmer down on the 10th.
---
You don't lose any honor.
---
"Pick whichever race suits you, night elf priests are fine"
---
Just mana pots. But for Solenor the Slayer, I recommend max shadow protection potion. Restorative potion can help with the Winterspring demon.
---
Care to explain why?
---
It's definitely the smartest thing to do given the shitty situation and it's worth it, but it's really deluded if you think you're *"winning"* when your gameplay options are restricted to logging out then back in.
---

---
I do it as a mage on one of the smallest pvp servers. Horde on unbalanced servers are just tired of flying around the world for 45 minutes to find alliance that dont immediately port out. So we go to IF, try to get 1 kill every 3 minutes for 2-4k honor per hour. 
---
I dont like it any more than you guys, but the system is what it is. 
---
Just 7 more days.
---
visual bug.
---
Always shows unspecced tooltip.
---
&gt; At the end of the day you are killing people in a video game.
---
At the end of the day you are playing a video game. Nobody is "killing people" here. Let's not talk about crazy overreaction and then introduce such hyperbole...
---
I have never seen anyone with the mace.
---
Doesn't matter, they can kill me all they want if they get no honor.
---
I mean you're completely correct that it's the community's inability to function as normal people that has gradually turned WoW into the boring (but mostly asshole-proof) game that it is today. 
---
That said, Blizzard knows what this community is far better than the community itself does, and could have predicted this. 
---
These days, MMOs must be designed under the assumption that the socially-crippled nihilistic manchildren that make up a significant portion of the playerbase are going to behave poorly. 
---
If a game does not have something built-in to either discourage or sufficiently mitigate griefing or collusion or the myriad other wildly unethical behaviors that were rampant on the pservers, it's on the developer. 
---
The problems are 70% with the core designs of vanilla itself and 30% with Blizzard's decision (which was overwhelmingly supported by the community until P2 dropped) to have a pserver environment with much larger capacities. 
---
The players are largely a lost cause. Any system that requires people to act in good faith or have a certain attitude to function properly is fundamentally broken. Vanilla WoW is absolutely packed with such systems.
---
I support this. It's not like it's hard to track, even if it changes names, authors, UI, etc.
---
Not trying to be offensive, but this isn't a sustainable habit.  Better to own a single target to prolong spirit tap.  Then you don't need to drink that often, if ever.
---
I'd quite like one too. I was on holiday when wow launched so I was a few weeks late and never got to experience the early race 🙁
---
But sadly it's probably unlikely.  
---
Could maybe look into new private servers but I don't know anything about them, how busy they are, where to find them, etc
---
No and simply no. You cant ask anyone for this and noone is obliged to spend months of his life to improve your gaming experience. I cant afford doing it and im nowhere close to even think about such thing. You pay to blizz not to me
---
My guild doesn't believe me, but that's a pretty good ring for casters!
---
Found the person who plays on heartseeker
---
"If you don't like it, don't use it. It won't affect anyone else," they said.
---
Okay, I'll bet it doesn't work anymore because it was broken.
---
Is your cat an alliance rogue ?
---
Alliance do have better quests. Not sure about the rest.
---
You're right and difference must be made between the lvl60 that kills a lvl48 because it brings point (he's just following the rules of the game) and someone ganking for his own enjoyment because the game allows it.
---
For the lvl60 killing the lvl48 it's really hard to make another statement than "don't hate the player, hate the game" and bring the point of who in the first place, thought it was a good idea to not limit honor to players of the same level or above.
---
For the second... well it's grey area depending on the motivation. Someone can be roleplaying a bad guy and it would be rather unfair to call that person immoral because he's roleplaying in a roleplaying game. On the other side, let's not fool ourselves, most of the players killing low level players aren't RP'ing but simply like to feel powerful and the idea of a player behind the screen uninstalling the game make them laugh and I don't know if I would call those immoral but surely immature and not fair play.
---
Its same as Roof Top in Duskwood, as you need to jump roof to roof, so it can be consider as Abusive PvP.  
---
/!\\ Note that mods wont be baning people for this things if its a first time encounter by this behavior.
---
You could say that's "not in the spirit of the game", but it's not "unethical".
---
Got it.
---
Figured it was what you were going for.

*Last name Gao*

"WHY YOU NO DOCTOR?"
---
That's why he said if you're drain tanking.
---
And how would you know?
---
You need the best wand available.  Google wand progression and make sure you have the talent for increased wand damage.  You shouldn't need to renew.  Try shielding before pull.  That way if it's an emergency you can reshield in the fight.
---
&gt; I disagree. Douchebags have always existed. Hell I can be one sometimes. But it wasn't the anticipated and expected behavior of everyone on the internet.
---
That's not the original argument you made:
---
&gt;It's no secret that the default internet personality is 'edgy douchecanoe'. It didn't used to always be that way.
---
Moving the goalpost is not an honest argumentative tactic.
---
If its from 60/40 it can be fairly balanced by newcommers, if you make it 90/10 by yourself not loging in, you know the answer.
---
She generates threat for sure die to her dmg, just need to disable her soothing kiss autocast. You’ll kill mobs much faster with succubus so IMO it’s better exp/hour unless you’re dead set on VW tanking playstyle
---
Absolutely perfect.
---
Warriors - once you get access to more skills is there ever really a reason to use Rend (whether you're DPSing or tanking)?  I'm in the Lv30's ATM and I basically only use it when 1) my Sunder stacks are at 5 and 2) it's a higher level enemy so most of my hits are missing/glancing.  If my Sunder stacks are maxed, should I just use Heroic Strike instead?
---
Must be nice not having to feed your pet on every death
---
&gt; Getting ganked counts as PvP activity, and resets the timer to 5 minutes.
---
Please stop spreading fake news
---
Sounds like PVE with extra steps.
---
Goddamn. I helped a guildie farm it and it took 26 runs to see HoJ. If I get the sword I'll definitely grind HoJ... And maybe try my hand at IronFoe...
---
this is soooooo much nicer than my server. 
---
i can't believe how few horde are swarming for you. lucky!
---
Found the BRM camper
---
Spoken like someone that doesnt see the reality of the world around them. Reality is that you just wont have opposing faction members to farm. Try corpse running 10 times to get to your destination then come back and explain to me what pvp is. 
---
If this was the classic experience I can promise you no one would have even resubbed to relive the "classic" experience. 
---
Dont you have a class to attend?
---
That's a nice way to try and justify it, but the truth is that people with a healthy mental state have no desire to waste 10 hours a day playing a video game because they could be doing something productive in real life that takes actual effort.
---
Shaman tanks bring zero utility to a raid.
---
Feral druids might be comparable for tanking but when not tanking, they have much higher dps.  Not to mention better defensive cooldowns and an additional battle res/innervate.
---
Warriors have some of the highest mitigation and threat generation of all tanks.  A fury/prot warrior dual wielding is able to output so much threat that the raid is able to bring along higher dps without worry of wipes.
---
People seem to think that just because something is possible, they don't need to plan for contingencies.  Players disconnect.  A boss gets parry hasted and drops the tank to 10%.  A dps steals threat on a tauntable boss.  All of these things happen fairly regularly.  And by taking a shaman MT, you are essentially saying, "Try me, I don't care."
---
I have not said that shaman tanks suck nor that they are not viable.  I am saying that there is zero reason to use one.  This is not a zero sum game.  Changing a tank from a warrior to a shaman is not without penalties.  But there are no bonuses to be gained either.
---
If we look at the typical raid meta, the MT is constant from the first pull to the last.  Unless there is a super, critical, amazing compelling reason to change MTs during the run, it isn't done.  Except with shamans and the highly nature immune bosses.  So, you need to have a warrior/druid OT that is geared enough to handle some very hard hitting bosses.  And magically, you now have a tank who has the same mitigation as the shaman but brings benefits to the raid in terms of tanking.  And you sideline him for the shaman, why again?
---
This is a min/max mentality.  Why should I bring a lower performing tank, when the whole raid hinges on that player?  If I had to pull 20 dps from a roster of 30, I would grab the highest dps followed by raid buffs and needs.  5 hunters and 5 enhance shaman wanting in?  Probably grabbing 2-3 hunters and 0-1 shaman.
---
Shaman tanks are viable.  They are capable.  In the right hands and with the right support, they can tank quite a bit.  The margin for error and disaster are much, much higher and in the end, shaman MTs are really only for stroking the pride of the shaman.  Please don't pretend otherwise.  In the end, a shaman tank provides nothing that an equally geared warrior or druid could not do better.
---
I didn't touch on paladins because they are not a suitable comparison.  The additional armor, higher mitigation through blocking, and second to none AoE tanking bring a lot to the table and are more than viable to swap on certain fights due to their strengths.
---
I just can't stand this drama anymore. It seems to me that 30-40 years old people are crying about children who aren't behaving like honourable adults on a playground. Leave the playground ffs you old creeps and join your retirement community on pve where you (and me) belong.
---
The point is that you can just focus on single target dps instead of aoe, and it makes the run far safer _and not that much slower_ if the tank is having trouble. There's nuance to this tanking thing. Is the tank starting with 0 rage? Well then you need to wait, don't cone of cold or anything, just chill for a moment. That's the point, that's there's nuance and not just one zerg zerg aoe cleave.
---
&gt;When Aoe I don't expect tank to keep full aggro, but try their best to mitigate incoming damage or I die fast 
---
Just don't aoe if you're "dying fast" from aggro you're pulling. Its easier _not_ having to chase the mobs that you just pulled and scramble to get threat on them.
---
Your server? Delusional troll
---
All these people crying about being camped, meanwhile I just rez stealth and walk away.
---
Its fun for those people corpse camping you and its hilarious for me because I got downvoted before release for saying this is exactly what would happen.
---
So lots of fun here!
---
Farming chests in SM.
---
2in GY, 2in Lib + Houndmaster , 1 in Armory + Herod.  
---
A run of all 3 takes 16-20min.  I get 1-2 BoE blues an hour.  Engi patterns and 12 slot bags are also common.  Lots of high 20s items for twinks.  If you herb you can get grave moss.  The cultist after Herod have the same drop table as SM.  So blues drop.   10-15g an hour from junk + 15-40g from drops.
---
It’s a low risk farm.
---
Why not just SA for Rage dumping when SS and SB is on CD? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  HS is utterly useless according to me for tanks
---
Yeah, third or fourth best in 1 on 1 when you’re expecting it, wearing the correct gear, and at full health and self buffed. Most situations are not as fair as a 1 on 1 duel with a rogue.
---
Even as a rogue I can handle 3 at a time with my cooldowns up. And mage meta in classic is aoe grinding so I’m not sure what you’re on about.
---
FWIW I play on a PvE server, but I think it'd be a good idea for them to release new PvP servers where they try to maintain the faction populations with faction based queues.
---
really stretching the definition of helpful
---
Some random person probably added a password for shits and giggles.
---
Some people are entertained by different things? I like football, maybe you like basketball? What’s the problem
---
Ironfoe is my pipe dream, it took 3 runs just to finally get a group through the gauntlet, of course it was the first group with a mage.
---
It's k, you get 0 honor while I stealth away.
---
Real world PvP occurs when players on opposite factions compete for resources out in the world (black lotus, rich thorium, or the entrance to a dungeon can be resources).  It's spontaneous and it creates rivalries and enmities that make the game worth playing.  Every attempt to "create world PvP" by offering inducements failed (like the honor system or the Naxx patch with its "world PvP objectives").
---
That's not to say that I dislike the honor system (I do like it.  I think it's a very good thing that only a few people will ever get rank 14 gear, even though that fact pisses lots of people off).  But the honor system doesn't create real World PvP.  Farming HKs is not world PvP.  I've had multiple people complain that I've killed them while they were trying to farm HKs.  People say things like "I don't understand why it's fun for you to kill us?  We're just trying to farm honor".  It's hard to put into words how backwards your perspective has to be to type something like that.
---
I'm optimistic about all this because no matter how many people "farm HKs," you absolutely can find (or create) real world PvP.  And it's just as fun as it was 15 years ago.
---
Like it or not that's how it happens on aoe pulls. You just need to do your best then it's quick and uneventful.
---
Yeah, especially when it's the only thing that's being discussed all day every day since honor points dropped. This is basically just venting at this point presented with manners. This is what the whole sub is about ever since.
---
Best part is, it won't lead anywhere, since we already know what will and what won't be done about it.
---
I think it's funny how many ppl talk about down ranking heals but if you are still leveling, still working on BiS, your max rank heal is your most efficient.
---
I rolled pVP
---
Yeah I was meleeing rag, while it just stood there.
---
Exactly, why not just keybind it? And if you really need to mark skull in combat, classic always gives you that time. It’s not retail -.-
---
I really stopped playing since p2 rolled out except I did do a couple nights of shenanigans. 
---
As a low level player (40) go to BRD into every AoE and give any team that casted said AoE dishonorable kills. 
---
You might be collateral but the hit hurts a little!
---
It ain’t fun for the corpse campers
---
I for one am very thankful for phase 2. It broke the spell of WoW that was on me yet again. There is simply not enough time in the day to be a productive person and play an MMO. I now know that. I’ll give them another try when I’m older, retired, and have nothing else to love for I suppose. Otherwise sitting in front of a monitor feeling helpless just isn’t my idea of a good time. I already do that enough each day at work.
---
I don't think people are stopping doing dungeon X or Y thanks to PVP, i have an alt on a PVE server (Westfall) and people rarelly do Uld or ST there.. Those dungeons are just too long/boring/hard to get so people avoid it.
---
This sounds like quite an interesting concept actually, would you care to expand on it please?
---
I .mean Warlocks should wear at least 3 sets PvE ,pvp and aoe set (fire damage)unless your pve set is neutral damage but most sets are shadow wrath and +shadow damage thats what i do..takes a lot of space tho
---
Im sure a lot of people are going to be frustrated with either not having a solid BG team or not being able to catch up on honor if you have a job, etc.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Where the hell do you get mana biscuits?!
---
lol
---
Isn't Mana Igniting Cord bis tho?
---
Mage main here. Why take axe over any of the other items? How long until you upgrade axe?
---
Is there a website or anything that tracks when the world bosses were last killed in each server or anything?
---
Sure they are, I see them patrolling over the corpses of afk alliance that the undead rogues are killing with zero repercussions every day!
---
Unfortunately, campers have as much a right to play has the ones camped. The problems are the rules around the whole honor system. Toxic players are in every online game
---
this.
---
Costumizable Nameplates, they can change colour if you get aggro.
---
&gt; boomer
---
Ironic. You are the one that acting like a boomer. Stop crying and get over with it.

Best racial in the game, I'll fight anyone who disagrees.
---
more time to corpse camp you ;) see you at the graveyard
---
Yea thats a hard no. PvP server phase 2 makes it better xp/hr to wait for groups in UC which is already abysmal
---
Is it at all feasible to push r11 without going apeshit crazy? I’m hoping that I️ can casually push towards 8/9 then go for 11 when I️ have a free week off of work or something.
---
Friendly with argent Dawn, their qm in epl sells them. Pretty costly but best water in the game.
---
It's my favorite part
---
Ahh. The real collusion is the Horde/Mage-Port Mafia.
---
Essentially there are multiple spawn timers but if no nodes are available they wont spawn. Same thing with lotus and pool of enchanted water. Max of 2 nodes of enchanted water 4 spawn timers
---
Go to a PvE server. Level. Server transfer. You'll still suck at PvP...but at least it won't be so bad. Wanna get good...roll on PvP server...read or watch guides onine... practice.  Also...don't roll a Warrior! 🤣 Good luck.
---
Level 32 warrior here.
---
Got lucky in gnomer and I have the shield plus a dagger for tanking and the axe. Also got lucky in an armory run I was carried through and got the ravager.
---
At this point I'm finding sm graveyard runs to be very low on the xp scale and library still hard to DPS in as I'm low.
---
Where should I level?
---
Rule 7
---
DM introduced Jump Runs which allowed people to generate a lot of gold. Are there other ways that come out later that are good farms for people?
---
So I’m a hunter about to hit lvl 43, and I’m wondering if I have the right idea for leveling to 50...
---
My thought was that I should continue questing until ~45, then run uldmann until 50. Is that the right idea or should I be completing as many quests as possible before turning to exp dungeon runs
---
I'm a med student currently and would 100% rather be a WoW classic player in this situation. Not trying to get sued for malpractice before I hit 60 (or graduate med school, whichever comes first)
---
Just pick one with mana, it'll be good enough.
---
After a few runs you'll pick up some details like warlocks in lbrs, spirits in dmw, etc. Doesn't matter too much though tbh
---
If your complaint about a PVP server is that there is 'Too much PVP', I don't think it's worth hearing.
---
Faction imbalance is as old as WoW. Horde was always the more popular faction when it came to PVP. The way people countered them was by using /3 a lot more and understanding you have to retreat, and give ground.
---
You anti-pvp crowd are incredibly dangerous to the health of the PvP community. You keep pushing blizz on this, and they'll make a rash decision that'll kill world PvP. It happened in retail. It can happen here again.
---
circumstances that are not a fault of the game itself, but rather the player? Yeah I could definitely see people complaining about that :\^)
---
I normally tab a rend on everybody I’m tanking just for additional threat anyways. Sunder—-&gt; revenge when it’s up——&gt; dump any additional rage into heroic strike
---
And honestly, I wish I felt the same. I just don't have the will or the patience to deal with being corpse camped or being ganked by skulls and their cohorts. The game is long enough, having time wasted so some torture-kink can get off? Nah, I'm good.
---
What link are you even looking at? It literally says "players online currently" and it's consistently pulled just shy of 6k for weeks. 
---
&gt; billizard stated that a layer is as big as an old server. we are down to 1 Layer now, so the limit is 3-4k online at the same time 
---
You don't understand how layers work, layers do **not** have a fixed size, that's the entire point of them. Layer population larger as the number of layers shrunk. Go to 5:48:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8)
---
Because it's a change that affects gameplay.
---
If u dont have the dps to kill rag in p1 u dont have the coordination or gear to last till p3, have ur dps study their rotation and bring relevant consumables/enchants/etc. People 1 phase rag in greens/blues all the time, know ur class and bring ur shit, ez fight
---
Are you from America? I'm not actually betting anything, it's a figure of speech.
---
&gt; fights
---
Imagine squad ganking low-level newbies still level grinding and using the word *"fight."*
---
heroic strike is not utterly useless not sure where you're getting that information
---
Slowest speed. It has 3.6 speed and therefore the highest max (and average) damage. 
---
The two other options, sword and mace, have 2.9 and 3.4, respectively. 2.9 is MUCH to fast, 3.4 is Okay'ish. I'd still prefer the whirlwind axe.
---
Plus, as an orc you get +5 weapon skill for using axes.
---
You'll probably replace it deep into your 40s/50s. I've seen warriors with it at level 60.
---
Chunder-clap ‘em
---
And I, as Alliance on Incendius, can't land in Tanaris without getting clapped by 5 rogues, 3 warlocks, a warrior, a shaman, and one rather zealous mage. For what its worth, I feel like Incendius has a lot of back and forth, but I haven't looked at the numbers.
---
So i am guessing you would be running these dungeons with the intention of power leveling a lowbie.  If that is the case, why are you showing RFC as an ally paladin?  It seems like just getting an alliance lowbie into RFC would more trouble than it is worth.
---
I've had so many mages poly then cone of cold the group then yell at me (the tank) for attacking the sheep.  Haha, I still love mages though.. their dps and cc is just so nice.
---
&gt;You are trying to say that nurses, doctors, lawyers and women can't be bad people?  
---
No, thats not at all what i am saying.  First of all ganking someone isnt being a "bad person".  Second i was only countering you weeb-like claim that they must all be man-children.   
---
&gt;just suck it up and keep getting bullied?   
---
Or move on to another zone? Rereoll PVE?  Realise that this is part of the game and stop being a whining?   
---
&gt;Don't act like you aren't a bad person.  
---
Lol for ganking people for honor?  Seriously?  Bruh, reroll pve please.  
---
&gt; I'm not claiming to be a good human being  
---
IDGAF  
---
&gt;but I don't defend harassing people in an unfair game,  
---
ItS UnFAiR!!!111   Bro REROLL THEN!  This is PVP on a PVP server, learn to deal with it, suck it up buttercup!
---
Well that's it. I'll have to take off my lionheart, dry my tears, and ride my epic mount off into the sunset.
---
The point we were trying to make is it isn't "Hard" to farm gold as prot, its "harder" to farm than any other class. Again, not going to take a mage seriously about this, you can sit in a city and make gold while idle. Hell, my buddy made 300g while beating The Outer Worlds.
---
Autoswap all accounts and transfer some people into NPC bodies. I want to see Bolvar and Thrall running around out there.
---
If you aren't even playing on a pve sever, why woudl you even care?
---
You are just gatekeeping people from a game, that doesn't even effect you.
---
It's good so a rogue can't stealth ..
---
You can’t overwrite buffs with weaker versions of the same buff. You get the message “a more powerful spell is already active”
---
\[cast flash of light\]
---
*-pulls out flashlight and flashes person-*
---
Good, that would stop the zergs.
---
A true wow classic Redditor!
---
True story.  Was looking at my payment history the other day to see when I stopped playing and saw the first year or so liberally sprinkled with 1 day, 3 day, even a week credits.
---
I have the addon and chat is fine. 
---
You have not proved that honor spy is the problem, OP
---
Oh yeah, my guild definitely traded in vanilla and people on our server knew it/posted evidence.  Nothing ever happened.  Now it's not even in the TOS to not collude so anyone getting all up in arms about this is wasting their breath.
---
If they didn't want preconceived notions, why call them warlocks? Why not just make up a name?
---
&gt;yes i'm sure all of those heart surgeons, rocket scientists, and nuclear physicists have nothing better to do than sit on a 13 year old game and grief other players for 12 hours a day   
---
I said cardiac doctor btw and it was a Sunday after a holiday, so yeah, they had nohing better to do than enjoy their day off.  You find that abnormal that people with better jobs than you can't enjoy a sunday playing video games?
---
What makes the word 'Kant' so especial as to make such a reaction on you? Is it the fact that I, for lack of a proper education in the topic I'm tackling, resorted to one of the most relevant authors in Ethics? Does that make you go 'oh, for fucks sake'? Geez.
---
It was an observation and an invite to discussion, not a desperate prayer for someone to tell me that the solution to a problem is avoiding it!
---
I rolled PVP because I had a group of people joining together, I knew it would be painful but I had no idea it would be this irritating. I don't have a lot of free time to play the game and with the latest update it went from the occasional high level griefer just out to annoy people to an unplayable hellhole for anyone trying to just level a character. 
---
I should have known it would be like this. So I just said, fuck it and rolled a fresh character in a normal server and I'm so glad I did. If the knowledge that I 'rage quit' out because of their actions serves to excite some of these cretins then at least I have the knowledge that my actions are the closest thing to someone else giving them sexual satisfaction that they'll likely ever have.
---
To be fair, it is a city under the bottom of the map.
---
Speak for yourself, I love P2!
---
The first few months almost everyone ran around in +stat gear.
---
Im a pvp player so i like spending my game time in world pvp. Im not camping, and im happy to get in top 300. I will probably never pass rank 8 even if i tryhard the shit out of it.
---
Time is money, friend.
---

---
One odd thing I've noticed (and might just be delusional) is the rain looks far worse than it did in the original. I don't remember it looking like little slithers of bird poo.
---
Yeah that’s why I was thinking remove honor to BGs could help soften the damage. I doubt we’d even have this discussion if the server pop was 3000 not 20000.
---
&gt; It's complicated to talk about ethics in a game when you simply follow the rules of the game.
---
No, it isn't complicated at all. The rules of football initially did not have a "don't punch other people" rule. That doesn't mean that it was ethical to punch other people in the game, the creators of the game simply *did not think that anyone would be such a large asshole that it was necessary to add that rule*. Then an asshole played the game, and then the rule of no physical contact was added and it was against the rules. 
---
Does that mean the asshole punching people in football before the rule was added *not* an asshole? No. He was very clearly being unethical and very clearly being an asshole. What he was doing was very clearly against the spirit of the game. Just because you are acting within the rules of the game *currently* does not mean what you are doing is ethical. The rules of the game are no excuse for any of this behavior. People corpse camping are unethical assholes. Period.
---
For sure. Lots of people like being part of that group that gets to push content (whether it be honor ranks or killing some of the harder bosses) and get frustrated by not having a guild or the time to do those things. It’s kind of funny how WoW has a tendency to want to play WoW over real life commitments just to compete with others that for whatever reason can allocate absurd hours to playing
---
Not sure your price range but I have a surface pro a that thing worked great until I made my pc. I had to get a docker so I could connect multiple displays &amp; kbm but wow classic ran fine on the mid settings
---
I don't see anything unnatural about it. Any veteran vanilla/private player could have predicted this before the game even came out just based of how the phases were planned.
---
maybe he is running someone through wc or something.
---
and a sword which I never saw on anyone either
---
these gms need to grow the fuck up lol.
---
&gt;if you got a player to camp each vein in a sector, could you very quickly continually mine them?
---
In my experience, this is exactly what mining bots used to do. I think this caused Blizzard to change the behavior of nodes in WotLK.
---
Oh the fucking irony hahahah. You were the first one trying to insult someones life because of a game and now you're trying to spin it. Get a grip and look in the mirror for once.
---
That's usually how I do it. (NOt healing them unless I got a bit of mana to spare)
---
However I let a Warlock die once because of it...  
---
He got poisoned and I thought he was just life tapping. He wasn't. And then he died, while I was standing right next to him with mana to spare... :S
---
For mages theres ZG bijou farm and Naxx trash farm. Who knows if ittl work though since melee leeway and spell batching are a thing in xlassic.
---
Roll pve and shut the fuck up. Another post about something you knew was coming .. put your pride in the back seat and get off these cancer imbalanced servers
---
Lots of easily disproven theories exist (or have existed) because no one thinks to test them or we have poor tools/methods to verify it.  If it was 'known' that raw +dmg gave more spell power, then people wouldn't question it and accept as fact.
---
I have seen a ton of messages when in Tanaris asking for tanks for ZF.  I am now a Level 52 warrior with like 6 quests for ZF.  Should I go with sword and board or 2H Sword for ZF?  I don't want to make my healer's life harder.
---
Yes
---
The main problem is they open "Brazil" and "south America" servers and they still host them in North America, which means shit ping for us. Idk what's so hard about hosting servers down here, we have them for every other game and they work fine.
---
Still rocking that axe at lvl 52........... I simply can't get my hands on anything better. Kang would be a decent upgrade but I am not paying 70 gold for it.
---
I'm not sure why that changed then,  but i stand corrected.
---
Getting jumped by 12 players isn't PvP. It's tantamount to entering MC and the first six trashpacks just immediately aggro on you "just don't raid lol", "PvE happened in a PvE instance bro lmao".
---
Counter argument: try talking to your group before you start? 
---
If you explain what you want to do before each big pull, and they still fuck up, ok then that's on them. However, if you walk around as a pug dungeon tank (not really that impressive) and your attitude is "my group is so bad kek tanks are in demand xD" you are probably not that good of a tank, and probably not giving your group a chance to know what the hell is going on. Remember that you still need heals and dps to get shit done, and it's not like you can do any content without them. Teamwork works, belittling people usually does not. The content is easy just don't be a dick. Your job is to enable your group to be able to do their job, welcome to tanking.
---
You're not a baby sitter, and you aren't doing anybody any favors by patronizing grown human beings in a video game by treating them like that.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I'm Horde on a Horde dominant server and I don't understand how it's fun to corpse camp or deathball, so I don't. World PvP went from fun to utter shit overnight. I'm just raid logging until BGs come out.
---
This is the only spec you need.. ns for wpvp ele mast for bgs https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0x
---
First time playing WoW was because my friends were horde. Now it's because I hate gnomes and attempt to kill as many as I can.
---
😂
---
Mine never work anyway
---
Nah, he's my guildie and totally fucked up and clicked the wrong thing and the GMs won't help him out with fixing it.
---
Nah, it not as fun for them.
---
The only difference is they are miserable. We are crying here because there is a serious issue with the population which is affecting the entire game experience. Since blizz doesn’t fucking communicate, this is the only way they will notice there is an issue.
---
You lose 10% damage, 3% crit, and omen. Hotw is not a dps spec and should not be used for leveling.
---
I don't understand people who pay for 20 wow accounts but do not invest in a proper environment. You do not even have space for your armrest, you gonna get carpal tunnel in a few months with this 5$ table and probably 10 $ chair. Get a real table and a real herman miller chair and start slaving away. Save your health.
---
its been useless complaints and shit since the game started lol
---
It just made it so a handful could get it instead of just one. So it’s ***easier***, but still a massive grind.
---
as hemo pvp, go viskag + core hound
---
For hunters, definitely go Engineering.  
---
Mining goes hand in hand with Engi, though you can pick up any other prof as your gonna be able to farm gold in DMN trib runs to level up any prof.  
---
For keybinds just make sure Aimed shot, multi-shot, flare, feign death and frost trap are all accessible, though in PvP you are gonna be using a lot of different spells.  
---
Make sure to bind cheetah and hawk to easily accessible keybinds as well.
---
All my friends decided on Horde, so that's what I went with.  It was basically pre-decided for me.
---
Most brazilian players are still on Thalnos-Horde or Faerlina-Horde. There was no real reason to transfer to Sul'thraze since it's also hosted on Texas which is the same place as all other "US-East".
---
The bigger the player pool the easier it gets to rank. Not sure why you would think it’s the opposite way.
---
Once you blow your 2 vanishes, you just wait. If you get unlucky you may have to wait more often than other times, but there is still 0 chance of death unless you get greedy and keep going without a vanish.
---
&gt; It only becomes grey area when you try to bend the rules
---
Or customs.
---
Like in soccer say your team has a player down hurt, but the other team has the ball. They kick it out of bounds to get a stoppage so your team can tend to the down player.
---
Custom dictates that when you throw it back in, you throw it to them. They gave up their possession so you could tend to your player, and you *should* respect that and give it back.
---
You are under no obligation to of course. You would not be bending the rules taking that throw in and using it to your advantage. That is 100% within the rules. It's also piss poor sportsmanship and 100% unethical. And next time your player is down, don't expect them to kick it out so you can tend to him, or if you kick it out, don't expect them to throw it "back" to you.
---
In WoW this would be like you losing a fight against some mobs, and an opposing faction member comes in and helps you kill the mob(s) you were fighting. I've done this before, help a dwarf warrior kill the mob, /wave, move on. I'm trying to communicate I am not a threat, I'm just here to quest or farm herbs.
---
But if he then attacks me later on in the same session(?), he goes on my KoS list. I don't use it so much as "KoS" but more like a "Be prepared for a fight" list. And I won't help him again. 
---
What happened with that guy was we were in WPL. I helped him out, he tried to gank me 5 minutes later, I feared him into a pack of enemies, hamstrung him, and watched as they killed him. Eat that repair bill, I feel no remorse. Later on I saw mobs respawn while he was fighting 2 others, he /beg'd me and I just /laughed. Sorry pal, I tried to be nice, you wanted to play dirty. Now enjoy the mud pie those ghouls are going to force down your throat as they stomp your face.
---
Waiting till multiple alliance raids show up and then they fight over BRM, what's not to understand.
---
from seeing some screenshots, the R14 healing mace is in the game now instead of Naxx patch, so that is a reason to rank hard for a healer. the R14 healing mace is only really replaced by C'thun's healing mace and the one off KT
---
For keybindings, you just need to find something that works for you personally. Nothing is objectively best. Most importantly, you can't have things that you need to cast while strafing bound in a way that prevents you from moving and hitting that bind easily. 
---
For example, if you put concussive shot on 0, it's going to be very hard to kite and keey conc shot applied.
---
For me, I try to stick to 1-4 because 5 and higher are a stretch for me while also on WASD. Some people like to rebind the WASD movement to ESDF to help remedy this. But then I use alt+1-4, shift+1-4 and ctrl+1-4 and my preference for slotting those binds goes in that order because I find the ctrl group the hardest to hit reliably.
---
I also use Q, E, R, and F and then the alt versions of those as well.
---
My most used buttons or buttons that are crucial to hit at the right time (like an interrupt/silence) are usually always in 1-4, Q, E, R and F or the alt versions of those. 
---
Finally, I try to keep a thematic consistency between all my characters if possible. This helps make sure my muscle memory doesn't need to change drastically between characters. So if I have a spell interrupt/silence effect, that goes on E. If I have a stun, that goes on Q. Things like that.
---
For professions, engineering is very much the best profession for PvP. Many of the fights in this video would not have been possible without the stun bombs from engineering. You can pair that with mining to make it cheaper or you can buy all your materials from the AH and pick up another crafting profession or a better money maker. For example, on my server ore/stone is dirt cheap and herbs are still very expensive (because of flasks) so you'd actually be better off taking engineering/herbalism and then selling herbs to buy ore and have extra profits.
---
 Getting to 305 weapon skill reduces your chance to miss by 2% and eliminates the 1% penalty to +hit from gear/talents vs. level 63 bosses, essentially giving you 3% hit 
---
That's the difference. So there's 2 effects from getting that 305. One is removing that 1% hit penalty, the second is reducing miss chance by 2.
---
The solution is to have the default, which most people don't touch, provide 80% of the functionality.  The remaining 20% is for those who want to dive into the settings and tweak away.
---
I use recount over details for this reason.  I don't use a custom UI for this reason.  I don't want to spend 30 minutes to an hour learning your settings and what this checkmark does or doesn't do.  I get that it is very powerful and can do amazing things, anything I want.  And yet Windows has a bigger market with casual consumers than Linux.
---
When you lock the basic functionality behind heavy settings, it doesn't matter if the end UX is amazing, it prevents a large portion of the market from even trying it.
---
Sure, good luck finding a group that will run it more than once or twice and then spending like an hour trying to get another group together. No one wants to run RFD. I've done it (even before Phase 2) and it was just absolute garbage XP/H, even as a healer.
---
And I know Horde got more dungeons in their zones. But what's the point if you can't even get past those levels? PvP server balance is just fucked. Yes, Horde control more of the PvP servers, but Horde don't have it easy either on servers dominated by Alliance.
---
But you can overwrite them with identical buffs, which is what's happening here.
---
None of these census addons/sites work anymore. Taking that as proof against my "shittalk" is hilsrious.
---
In a plane does it matter what state the plane currently is flying over?

---
Is that what's causing mail and most other things to be so slow in ORG?
---
Woah I didn't even know that was a thing. Thank you for the suggestion!
---
Wedding Crashers.
---
Hotw is a healing spec. Not a tanking or dps spec. You just happen to be able to tank with it moderately well.
---
We don’t want to read the pvp whining anymore even if it’s well/eloquently written
---
Cause there is always 500 people who do more than you or are simply more effective
---
Was 3k really the original cap?
---
Didn't Blizzard claim to have like 12 million subs at one point? Surely they would have have all fit on 3k cap realms?
---
I replaced it with the brd axe lol
---
If the server has 1000 alliance trying to play and 4000 horde, you think it's in Blizzards best interest to keep 3000 paying horde customer's from playing so that 1000 alliance customer's don't have bad PvP experiences? You think blizzard should risk 3000 players quitting so that 1000 don't?
---
Faction queues are a terrible idea at this point. It's too late. Blizzard already screwed this up too much. Either open up paid transfers, allow faction transfers, or remove the current transfer restrictions and let those servers complete their transformation into one sided pve servers. Stopping people from playing for arbitrary reasons is the worst solution.
---
Its for his double threat crit taunts
---
You're a moron.
---
I love SM/ruin, personally.
---
Right.  All the criticism of server pops needs to be considered through this lens:  **We ALL expected (and most still expect) some dropoff in server populations.**
---
That's the answer, right there...and the truth is, we'd ALL be pissed if they hadn't done this and we literally couldn't find groups or raids in 6 months.
---
I'm from the other end of the argument.
---
I fear these progressives who serve to only water down the vanilla experience until it's retail mini. 
---
I've already been hearing a decent amount of people wanting expansions to be released slowly on servers or have unique content for wow classic.
---
I say no to both. Keep Classic WoW, just classic.
---
A similar thing happened when blizzard kept trying to balance classes. In the end, most classes were gut and made less interesting. 
---
There is no man made solution to server imbalances and offering free server transfers will cause even more of a rift and continue the balance juggle of impossibility
---
Sure, but the fire resist buff is a very plausible explanation for why they're specifically all packed right in front of the UBRS entrance, which is a very random place to be when you're camping MC. Not saying BRM isn't swarmed, clearly there are a lot of raids hanging out there. But it's very unlikely they're sitting there to gank people.
---
Lol. No the other path is not any different. 
---
And why do I go? Because I hit 60 yesterday and am not finished with ony attunement. 
---
And if you think anything short of a fully prepared 40 man could get in without being dismantled right now you do not know how bad the situation is.

Wow, you're really trying hard to throw out those easy sticking insults, just so you can get the crowd on your side. *"hey look at this triggered looser guys, fuckhim!"*
---
Imagine if everyone acted like you, how are people supposed to communicate at all?
---
You aren't even good this, at least limit your insults down and try to have them make a little bit sense... weeb?
---
You are the one being toxic and throwing insults, since the start. Looks to me like you are the one that's actually triggered.
---
I switched at 60
---
Oy. I️ guess we will see how crazy it will be to push ranks.
---
We will have to see how bad it gets on Classic servers (personally, compared to pservers, I don't think it will be too bad). But the list includes and is not limited to:
---
\- sabotage other rankers who are in contention for your spot (hacking accounts, ddos, etc)
---
\- ghost queueing &amp; dodging
---
\- collusion with guilds from opposite faction (to sabotage other rankers who are in contention)
---
Why would anyone bother teying become a pro footballplayer when there is messi and ronaldo? Ur argument makes no sense
---
As a PM, this is pretty relatable.
---
Or heal every dps after one shadowbolt volley when they don't have aggro...  Don't heal dps at 90% when we don't have aggro it's a complete waste.
---
Gnome mages need to grant 3x bonus honor more like.

the amount of people that will literally just brain afk dungeons make you wrong, tanking pugs is babysitting in many cases. 
---
I will say keep close to the wall and the hunter will walk in the middle because he isn't even paying attention to anything except following group and using his shitty multishot every fucking fight and ruining shackles multiple times because he has 1 rotation and 1 rotation only. That was my last tanking run, the one before that had a different braindead and the bad runs have multiple braindeads
---
Once again, something the mega-private servers had no issue with.
---
Woow you guys. Surely finishing your instance is your goal and doing it quicker benefits everyone....

and 2 you're over-applying the literature here on a video game you can put down at any point and has no real consequences that the "victim" is not imposing on themselves (i.e. mental anguish).
---
Blizzard should've thought server/population issues through more. Most of them were obvious, even before launch. The servers being bigger is the biggest offender of all the shit that's going down lately. More people, more chance to get killed. Second is faction imbalance. We knew from the start most people would play horde on PvP servers. I expected the balance to be worse than it is currently, but it was obvious and expected nonetheless. Faction queues would have solved the problem. It would create more balanced servers, especially in the beginning when no one really had anything worthwhile done on their characters. Implementing it now is, I fear, too late. Although maybe not for all servers. Blizzard should deal with these problems first with trying to play smart with population and server structure before implementing any changes into the game, which is what no one really wants. Going all philosophical on this is poetic, but if you want anything to change, this is not the way. Maybe a few thousand will read this, maybe a few hundred will act on it, but that is not enough in the scope of all players.
---
Blizzard needs to act fast, but first of all, they need to address it and make a post about what they think about it and what they will do. BG's coming out will not fix the problem at all.
---
Having a PI priest for your top mage helps a lot too. 
---
Also, there’s no threat management in phase 1 so casters need to go crazy. Some PUGs or new groups don’t understand that at first.
---
This sounds like the Tyler tweet about cyberbullying
---
AV was the only BG that alliance dominated. There may have been a low/medium population server somewhere that had more alliance, but on average - horde has always dominated. True for vanilla, and it's still true.
---
Makes being alliance more fun.
---
I think most druids don't take the min maxing of their class that far... You can optimize this much but if you don't, the raid will be fine too, it's effectivenes doesn't stand on druids' DPS.
---
My advice is always to never even bother with the grind past 10/11 if you dont enjoy it. If you aren't having fun in BGs during the honor grind, you're going to be miserable.
---
Are fucking serious? Look at the first posts ive made in this thread! Im literally saying its not hard, but harder! That was the whole goddamn idea of my initial comment. Its not hard to make gold in wow. Some classes have it harder than others, but that doesn't make it hard. Jesus!
---
Ok then, where do you get your facts from that Hearthseeker is the only Alliance dominated server? Really set your self up didnt you? :D :D
---
There's not really a choice with the way the honor system works. It's kind of crazy though that kamikaze-ing for 1 HK then getting murdered and waiting for rez timer again is a decent strat for honor farming. I don't really blame Blizzard, this is the system we signed up for and all they really could have done to avoid this is leave layering in and pissing people off anyway. If they had smaller servers, there would be population issues when people inevitably quit anyway. No matter what, people will be mad and blame blizz, but really Vanilla was just a flawed game and this is what we get.
---
Unless you are or were actively PvPing your honor worth is low and remains low. 
---
Killing carebearss that aren't even Rank 1, on their way to a dungeon is trashy honor, especially if you kill them 3-4 times as they corpse run. 
---
The only people that are worth anything is the people that are getting kills.  
---
It is also an extreme waste of time considering we get BGs in a week.
---
Done.
---
Wtf lol, I afk a lot everyday. But I haven't played since launch, maybe about a 1.5 weeks after
---
It's the same for horde on Heartseeker.  You'll typically have 10-15 alliance hold Orgrimmar while 30 lvl 60 horde refuse to pvp flag a d wipe them.  Pretty sad
---
Slowest weapon speed, which is great for arms warriors.
---
It's an axe, which is great for orc warriors.
---
Arms has a talent that increases crit with axes by 5% (which is pretty huge)
---
You usually dont need to upgrade it for a while (8-12 levels)
---
“Have we crossed state lines yet?”
---
“Yep”
---
“Hell no I’m not committing a federal crime”
---
I've found the same thing. My solution has been simple, make friends with the ones that appreciate a cautious approach. It's not hard to make friends as a tank, especially after a run with 0 deaths. The people I want to play with would rather spend 10 seconds setting a pull up than 10 minutes corpse running.
---
right? 15 years ago i'd have been fine with that, not today
---
And make it stack.
---
Hows the bank look?  That's where things get messy for me.
---
Its not noticable at all, i play on 60:40 server in the minority. And if you cant handle a 60:40 population, im not sure MMO's are for you, they are never ever 50:50
---
People seemed to really like the previous one, so I hope you'll like this one too :)
---
If you're interested, I've made a few more that are on my channel on YouTube, [which you can find here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCogrCgPsURaDEZspPnL5Z2g)!
---
You're underestimating just how many people *aren't* doing it though. It doesn't take much for people to be included in the ranking. I did roughly an hour a night with my guild and I'm already rank 4 within 2 weeks of barely trying, something like horde #600 on the server. Obviously not everyone will make something like R13 but plenty of people will be trying.
---
Turns out having almost twice as many people makes a ground war a lot easier
---
&gt; There are a few spots that always cause problems - mainly spots that have often caused wipes in the past as dps asspull.
---
Scholomance, door to welp room, there is a pack to the left of that door you *can* skip, but dps ass-pulling (usually hunter pets) those when actually entering the room has made me kill them just in case.    
---
It's one of the more blatant examples I can remember.  
---
Strat UD and UBRS also come to mind.   
---
Taking extra packs that *could* be skipped and taking extra time for them is still faster then trying to skip only to then wipe and have to walk back to the dungeon because some spatially unaware individual parked his arse to close to the pack.
---
You need to gear up the tanks with threat items so your DPS can do their thing without pulling aggro.
---
Anecdotes dont beat data my dude.
---
i've seen it lately, people argue its good for humans but wtf its too fast to be a good weapon
---
News flash: alliance can form the same size groups and apply similar tactics to break up horde presence. If you aren’t doing it’s not our fault. I’m on a 55/45 sever and alliance still chooses to get fucked. You guys can’t create a cohesive group to save your lives.
---
Again, you can have a vanish up. You pickpocket for a minute or so and your pickpocket is resisted. Oh shit, now you have to take evasive actions. You try to create some distance between you and the mobs and you vanish. A lot of times that works. But also guess what, vanish is resisted by one of the mobs as well and knocks you out of stealth. Ya dead :/. Or even worse! Your vanish wasn’t resisted, but guess what! Spell batching and you’re knocked out of stealth and dead again. Both situations I wasn’t being greedy and I had vanish up. 
---
While I’m not saying don’t do BRD. To claim guarantee 0 death is a flat out lie and rogues reading your comment shouldn’t be lead to believe a false narrative you provide.
---
I’m hoping that because of the size of battle groups, collusion won’t be a thing. 
---
Hoping because it’s Blizzard and not a random pserver, DDOSing and hacking isn’t a thing (I️ could be wrong, but hope not).
---
What’s ghost queueing and how does dodging work with BGs? It’s been a long time since I️ last did this.
---
Hm, maybe I'm doing something wrong.  
---
But on my cat it's always - 1-pull, kill, heal, back to cat and pull next.  
---
If I will pull two mobs, it's almost always loosing full HP and I would need to sit and drink after this.
---
Yes, Blizzard should have forseen that players would flood chat channels with thousands of messages and throttled in response.  Right.
---
DDoS works because it is incredibly difficult to properly forecast how much load your servers will receive and what they can handle.  Most popular websites get self DDoS when they first launch.  The devs think the product will sell okay but not gangbusters, then it goes viral and everything overloads.
---
the thing is and most people dont get this... If u take all take all the players who tend to play horde, make them play alliance and vice versa, the Alliance would shit all over horde and it would be alliance dominated servers. And the servers werent imbalanced at first, it started being that way cuz for some reason the mentality of people who tend to play alliacne, is to just quit or whine about it on reddit. If u pissed on people 3v1 and didnt give a fuck about who u attack like Horde players usually do, THIS WOULDNT BE A PROBLEM. I've seen multiple videos proving my point where for some reason Alliance players feel some sort of righteus whatever and just let people walk by and flame other Alliance players for killing someone on a PvP server... This isnt a blizzard problem this is a YOU problem, and if the mentality of Alliance players dont change, neither will the imbalances.
---
Ya the mods dont understand what to do. They let this place turn into /r/wow. Shame.
---
Since way before the release date even
---
If MC can be cleared by lvl 55s I dont understand why people would waste money on consumables
---
Aren't you that insufferable Karen from the Countdown to Classic podcast?
---
Horde is just cooler.  Never played alliance, never plan to.
---
When people use the word hard relating to WoW they mean relatively obviously. Nothing in this game is actually hard, it was beaten 15 years ago by us when we were 12.
---
These guys took care of ya, just make sure you are in the the lfg channel (/join lfg)
---
They just sound upset and want validation for their weird views.
---
Yea but holy shit, more embarrassing is you getting your panties in a bunch over "poosniff", go play on an RP server if you want fantasy names
---
Wow didn’t know this before. Question, is it always the same 3 guys through out the fight? What happens when 3 of them are out of melee range? What does it mean bubble them up? A priest bubble? Does that prevent them from flying away?
---
Nah you're a shill. Great counter.
---
See how easy it is to just say shit with no backing?

You're right, absolutely bad choice of wording by my part. Being stoic and assuming the worst possible outcome, it's all but unnatural what we're experiencing. Unfortunately English isn't my native language and I lack a lot of vocabulary to fully express what I want to say. I guess, by 'unnatural' I meant overcharged, exaggerated or out of bounds.
---
I've seen mages solo ZF at 42 already, might still give exp at 54 I think. Also seen you can start DME lasher+satyrs at 56 which is crazy op. So you just need something between 54 and 56.

After declared against TOS, author posts code on github.  Now anyone can make a mod, install it and use it.  You can ban by name but people will just make new names.  And then you waste Blizzard's time by testing every addon.  Or worse, Blizzard moves to a curated addon list and effectively kills the modding community.
---
If I like doing it, why should I stop? I'm working, being a productive member of society and making sure to hang out with friends, tell me one reason to stop doing it even though I want to do it and it doesn't affect my life negatively.
---
My favorite bit was the miners haha too bad they could stay friends!
---
"One possibly incorrect outlier means the whole set is crazy wrong"
---
Yea man that's how it works!
---
There are lots of videos and what not now but back in the day you just had to make careful pulls. There wasn't any marking either so you had to type out what to kill first.  Tanking is pretty easy really. Just go for it and don't worry about what you do or don't know as long as you have a good rotation, and basic kill order (casters first, etc). People will correct you on shortcuts and boss abilities. Occasionally you'll get stuck with an absolute shit group but that's just life. You'll learn a lot from the shitters.
---
You are correct (I'm hopefuly, at least) on the first two points.
---
I won't go into detail about how it's done, but ghost queueing/dodging effectively allows a premade to ensure that they never face a team that they don't want to face. People quickly realized, on private servers, that while it may be competitive to have a really sweaty premade vs. premade BG going, it's not good honor per hour. With "clever use of mechanics" these premades were able to ensure that they could queue freely and never have to face a team that they didn't want to "waste time" with.
---
Every game is a sandbox, there is noone telling you you need to go around shooting people with your gun on Fortnite, you could just play the Sims on it if you really wanted to. It'd just make more sense for you to just play the Sims if that's what you wanted, same with WoW being an MMORPG and intentionally bypassing the social aspects.
---
Cool, do you ATLEAST have an anecdotes on your own? Wich server do you play on? Do you play on 60:40 server? 
---
In a big game world like word of warcraft 60:40 is not gonna be noticable, its not like the entire server is always running together.
---
If you cant handle 60:40 population you shouldnt be playing MMO's in the first place, its ALWAYS close to 60:40 than it is to 50:50, stats prove it. Time to play a 1v1 game like SC now :)
---
Outside of raid time (when you’d like to be able to swap roles freely, if needed), there is zero reason to carry all of these sets. Under normal circumstances, you only need a melee set and a caster set (dmg or resto, not both). You will almost always have time to swing by a bank to pull appropriate gear out before going to a dungeon. Carrying it all around is just poor inventory management, and that’s a player issue not a class issue.
---
change continents on horde. change continents on alliance. one is completely pvp free and easy, one can take corpse runs to even get on the boat.
---
compare high level quest hubs - alliance are all exposed/no guards, horde are either IN horde territory or surrounded by 55 guards.
---
obviously you can be ganked in the world, but alliance get ganked/camped doing ANYTHING outside their town because of how poorly designed the game is. horde have it so much easier dude. ive level both to 60 on "balanced" servers.
---
Glad I main a hunter!
---
So, 2? classes can *maybe* kill you. 
---
If you have gear, you just overpower (heh) them anyways. 
---
Or, you are just bad. 
---
Add in a pocket healer, and run over people left and right.
---
Reducing the cap to that number and at the same time introducing faction queues will be the easiest and effective thing blizzard can do against classic's current issues.
---
Because its not frequently updated and / or only takes into account raiders.
---
The discord approach relies only on the assumption that allies and horde are equally likely to ask "LFG BRD", which isn't all that strong of an assumption.
---
Data is only ever as useful as its collation. None of these methods are perfect, but one of them agrees with my experience and the other two disagree both with eachother and with my experience.
---
So you want to keep going and get at least blues? When do you estimate to get the needed rank? How did you proceed and had you fun in doing so or was it more like a necessary grind?
---
Very funny! You should make a patreon so people can support the channel! Keep it up
---
I see, but What’s the problem with refreshing someone’s buff timer?
---
Classic pets handle aoe by dying so I don't think that works now.
---
You don't need to flask for most of classic. Maybe first few clears before people get geared, but you should be fine without unless your guild is heavily undergeared. Get flasks to compensate for bad gear.
---
I wish Blizzard went with giving one single fuck about the success of this game and their player's experience while paying them money.
---
Sadly, they do not.
---
Cash cow. Activision will be a dead company by 2030 - just so very good at destroying value and creating none.
---
I'm not in a hurry.  I'd rather have no rage to start the next pull then to pull too early and wipe because my healer is OOM.  As long as I get to charge in I get enough Rage to start the pull.
---
 &gt; "I am in no place to tell people what to do, or even to judge how they spend their time"
---
&gt; immediately does that
---
&gt; says "ethics are personal" in the comments
---
&gt; immediately says an entire culture's ethics are *wrong* because they aren't *our* ethics, in the very same comment
---
Extreme hypocrisy really doesn't help your case.
---
This shit is amazing, also long-range mortars would be actually awesome ingame. Thanks for the videos you create! +1!
---
basically - it's just the culmination of basically guaranteeing another full night of raiding per week along with the consumable requirements for all raids and throwing another 20-man in the mix as well. it's all just observation on my end from a few years of it cycling over and over. the top-end and low-end players tend to not be affected much since the former clear it all quickly and efficiently and the latter are truly content with their casual pace. the middle portion of players seems to feel the squeeze more and they have tended to fall out here
---
No I'd say that's normal and probably the most efficient way to level as a druid. I thought we were talking about what was *possible* because you said the majority of classes "can't handle" 2+ mobs.  
---
I could handle 2 or maybe 3 mobs as a druid leveling but I was popping cooldowns and kiting with roots and doing all the fighting in bear form. They'd all die but it was more risky and less efficient than killing one as a cat and coming out to heal at the end. That's what I thought we were talking about.
---
My wife is Brazilian, and I just read your comment out loud to her. She wants to murder you, and I am laughing my ass off.
---
&gt; unironically saying that 12,541 vs 3 is a *"type of fight"*
---
Glad you missed the point. I'm sure you also like getting killed by other players when you want to do something totally different from PvP.
---
Yeah, I am still leveling on a PVP server (though just 40% of a level to go to 60)  and it boggles the mind how much time some people have to waste.  Like, I was in winterfall killing furboys for a quest, and this alliance druid would just every 5 minutes or so path back, gank me as I am killing a mob at like 50% health, and then go off.  This happened 6 times.  Why?  Do people not know about honor decay.  I was still able to complete the quest, as he was clearly just pathing around everywhere stealthed and killing people on low health (clearly very talented pvp person) the one time he tried to gank me at the end a warlock showed up I grouped with and he left me alone.
---
Like... why?  You get nothing out of this, I don't care because the run-back isn't that bad, I am not being "camped" but why are you wasting your time on this?  There is no in-game benefit to this once I have been killed 4 times.
---
Once BG's come out this will go way down though, because the only way to keep up will be AV/WSG, so some WPVP, but most people will be doing BG's.
---
Used to make Sulfuras
---
That part expanded waaay beyond what I had initally planned :) Don't worry, it was just friendly rivalry ;)
---
Ooo all these replies back to back, me thinks a pickle gets tickled when bullshit is called. Give it a rest buddy you're wrongo
---
They become super cheap anyway, now guilds just keep it for crafting.
---
i like how 99% of these posts are about horde. Seriously for w/e reason that faction appeals to shit head losers. I personally never really cared I mean I played alliance in vanilla, horde in retail, now alliance again. But like.... just don't get the point of kill camping greys. I get both sides do this but.... let's be honest.... its mostly horde on most servers.
---
Log out before you respawn and youll refresh the honorless target buff. They can kill you the second you res, but they wont get anything for it.

Which still doesn't explain why would you comment on a discussion you're not interested in being part of. Honest question, isn't there any way of blocking certain key words to avoid seeing posts you're not interested in?
---
PS: thanks for the compliment, which I will take as one!
---
This right here.  It only takes a run or two of pain for you to learn all the pulls.  And then you'll be in high demand for 5-10 mans.  
---
For OP's spec...I personally found it much easier to tank 5 mans after I switched to prot.  I was able to do it in an Arms spec, but it got a lot harder at 60 to hold threat against crazy DPS.  I did all the quests in the plaguelands and then switched to prot.  
---
However, if you want to raid, that adds another wrinkle.  Most guilds will not need a raid tank.  But you could probably stay prot for a few weeks and collect DPS pre-BIS.  Then decide after that whether to switch to DPS or not.
---
and yet i cant stop reading it. i think im a masochist or something.
---
that's kinda funny, but i could actually see that giving them more satisfaction that just remaining silent
---
Cool, you dont know proportions.
---
How are your main two tanks looking for FR?  I'd suggest using those mats on gearing them up.
---
You could also look into (subsidise) the +3% CTH Scope for your hunters.
---
You need a large chunk of MC materials to gain reputation with Thorium Brotherhood.  Is anyone in your guild chasing a particular recipe that will make eg FR gear easier to obtain?  
---
Maybe look the mats up on wowhead and check out what they can be used for before selling.
---
Happy raiding!
---
&gt; nothing like this
---
Except the minute Alliance got Warmode bonus, they camped the fuck out of FPs. The difference is there was a small, clear goal, so they stopped once that was reached. 
---
The goal in Classic is to hit Rank 14. This obviously isn't going to happen in a few minutes like the Alliance WM quest completion, so people will do it for longee.
---
Me too, I go until I know the group needs to mana up then I stop. When mana hits &gt; 70% and they're still drinking I pull, by the time I have threat they will be done drinking an in combat. I've gotten so good at it I can stack up an entire room of trash mobs into one big pile, dps doesn't even have to move.
---
Your cast bar/ auto attack timers are super satisfying to watch
---
Im way too guilty of this myself, ill Even alt tab while auto attacking the mob
---
Awesome video man! Love your content.
---
They absolutely do. No doubt about it. The cities, the layout, everything is full horde. I fully agree with you there.
---
I am more talking about the disgusting nature of players now to camp people for Honor. It happens regardless of faction. We tried 5 zones and all of them alliance murdered us in packs. I mean middle of nowhere trying to grind green mobs, and dead.
---
Blizzard needs to address this.
---
Switching from my PvP server (Sulfaras, level 48 Alliance priest) to a PvE server because I can't level. Anyone have any idea which medium-high PvE server has a relatively faction balance? I think I'll going to roll Horde.
---
40 man horde gank squads camping your Level 45 body on a PvP server isn't worse?
---
There's no problem with it, it's just that they're wasting their reagents and mana on a buff that isn't needed. Not really an real issue or anything just sucks that it happens because of a UI issue is all.
---
I'd say run a census addon, i play on a realm thats at best 40-60 A:H Horde ratio, is med-high Pop (depending on the time of day) and yet as a Alliance every time i run a census its comes back as 2k to 2.5k+ Alliance online. Extrapolate that to the 40-60 and Horde should be at 3k to 3.7k online concurrent, then add to the fact that this server is medium to high pop doesn't make it very unreasonable for ppl to estimate that full servers are a lot more densely populated in terms of concurrent users.
---
Well if you were to do this solo - then perhaps that would be true.
---
But since you usually do it with 2-3 other People - you are in discord and you can laugh over this retail scum that Needs to learn how to Play - then it probably is more fun...
---
I can only imagine the fun it has to give. I am part of this retail scum that Needs to "gO tO REtAi:L"
---
I actually thought the same today. I know that the subreddit should also be a place where people can vent (with the idea that Blizzard will notice). But its just complaints now.
---
Hasn’t been my experience but I can see it. Probably varies server to server.
---
Get this to the top!
---
Not everyone is going to click the link.
---
I guess the long term goal is more important than fun in this case.
---
Camping FPs or choke points is the laziest but also the easiest way to get honor or HK right now.
---
That would be good idea, actually. I support this
---
That's only partially true - the meta IS warrior heavy, even though casters are stronger in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 situations. Mind Blast is strong but that doesn't matter when a warrior is sitting on your ass 24/7 and you have to keep spending your mana to shield yourself, eventually going OOM.
---
It's just, premades are not the only form of PvP in this game. People forget that.
---
You won’t ever get through to them unfortunately. They would rather a BRD take 3 hours longer by wasting their time strategizing every pull in trivial content.  Also the same people that complain they only have 2 hours to play and get nothing done.
---
They do this a lot on other servers too. The other day I was roaming around storm wind getting some supplies when a rogue opened up on me in an alley way. I'm a holy pally so I cant really kill anything and I needed to get back to IF so I did what any honorable paladin would do and just bubble hearthed to IF. The joke was on me though, because I forgot there is ALWAYS a rogue hiding in the IF inn too and he killed me before I was even fully loaded in. Oh well.

The last week of my r14 grind I was around 650k honor, and I wasn't spending nearly as much time as people claim it takes (8-10 hrs per day max). Bear in mind we did have instant queues on my server and we routinely 5-capped within the first 5 minutes, but thats not unusual for a good premade.

&gt;Wow, you're really trying hard to throw out those easy sticking insults, just so you can get the crowd on your side.

I dont give a shit about any crowd.  What i am saying is that you only have a couple of choices.  You can sit on reddit and cry about getting steamrolled on a PVP server OR you can fix your situation by taking responsibility for yourself and rerolling on a carebear server or moving to a new zone when you get ganked in another.  Although it seems you'd prefer to just sit here and fill your pampers about it.   
---
&gt;Imagine if everyone acted like you, how are people supposed to communicate at all?  
---
There is nothing to communicate about here!  This is just you bitching about your bad luck PVPing!   
---
&gt;ou aren't even good this, at least limit your insults down and try to have them make a little bit sense... weeb?  
---
I could not care less what you think about me.  This has nothing to do with the topic at hand which is you filling your diapers about PVP happening on a PVP server.   
---
&gt;You are the one being toxic and throwing insults, since the start. Looks to me like you are the one that's actually triggered.   
---
Ah, so you have resorted to the ever-successful  "no u" defense.  Clever!   
---
My suggestion to you is to reroll PVE, it seems PVP just isnt your thing.  I have been corpse camped numerous times on my server and i just alugh it off as part of the game.  I dont run to reddit and bitch about it.   Thats the game buddy!  Dont like it?  Dont play it!
---
Yes, but I though that OP asked about pulling and killing more than one mob on regular basis.

---
Thx for the tip, that would make her much more relevant
---
This guy needs to grow a beard and record this in his truck.
---
Yeah but only if you let everyone get low enough for it to be efficient.. If you're popping off a max rank heal to heal like 15% of the HP bar; that's like 40-60% overhealed and wasted mana. 
---
To be efficient you can't overheal.
---
Yeah if you're a casual only raid logging thus having no income I can understand that 50g might be a bit of a problem.
---
I've not played a rogue, so I'm asking this because I don't know the answer:
---
When you are stealthed, do mobs have a chance of aggroing on you? I've seen many rogues stealth up to a pack of "docile" mobs, and it stresses me out. I'm pretty sure I've seen packs of mobs aggro on a stealthed rogue, but I don't know if they detected him or if he willingly did something to break stealth.
---
120%, actually. 24% per shot.
---
i forgot the /s
---
You didn't have Retribution Aura on? :s
---
i forgot the /s here
---
Can not confirm this. Skullflame, despite horde ountnumnering alliance 2:1, is dominated by alliance :&gt;
---
This is great advice.  I'm gonna make sure I whisper my healer and ask how they want to run the dungeon from now on.
---
&gt; using logs in better
---
In what world is counting some of the population better than counting the full population, when you are trying to get an accurate count of the total?
---
But if 50+ and you do /who 60 gnome, what do you then do on Horde side? /who warlock what? Orc? Undead? Troll? (Don't remember if trolls can be warlocks)
---
But hey, at least those amusing-but-low-effort memes are eradicated!
---
Hey man, I am a warrior around same level as you on in the evenings, if you decide to stay we can  run instances together and try to keep your progress add me “Tenet” .
---
damn. I’m swords because I got a visgag but I’d prefer the PB and go daggers for pvp.
---
A better love story than Twilight.
---
Most functional adults have zero chance of hitting rank 14 on anything but a completely dead server.
---
I wouldn’t trust lowbie pugs on my server not to roll on twink gear so I’d never do that.
---
&gt; So, 2? classes can maybe kill you. 
---
I listed 4. And again, the only real way around kiting is to eat FAPs. Which gets expensive. If you want to go broke (or spend the time farming) popping FAPs for single HKs in open world, you go right ahead. 
---
&gt;Or, you are just bad. 
---
Or they're good. I used to main mage in vanilla. I ate arms warriors alive in world PvP. It was funny. Again their only recourse was to use FAP, and if they did I poly'd them until it wore off. E-Z.
---
&gt;Add in a pocket healer, and run over people left and right.
---
Well yes, now it's a 2v1. 
---
WoW isn't "balanced" and it never should be. It's an RPG, not a duel simulator.
---
Well yeah sounds fun to me for 2 kills. Taking solo on 3 players and try to kill one sounds more fun to me then.
---
Same I still refresh new multiple times daily and most if the time I'm disappointed
---
Dude. Not happy about the prices? Don't buy them.

Seriously Blizzard doesn't have to change anything.

"Dying 4 times in the way to brm"

That it? It's taken me and my friend like a hour to get there sometines
---
I wouldn’t say “full of.” In the population at large, you have about 10% with Cluster B type personality disorders, which are primarily characterized by a lack of empathy. Society mostly keeps them in check via social mores and legal repercussions.
---
In a video game world, though, social mores are more difficult to enforce, and the only “rules” which limit them are the physics of the game engine and combat system. As a result, that 10% of the population can have an outsize effect on the overall community.
---
1.) It is always three characters in melee range with the lowest GUID. It is up to you to decide who that's going to be.
---
2.) If they aren't in melee range, they're not a valid target and someone else will be knocked back. This leads us back to your first question.
---
3.) Power Word: Shield - It prevents them from dying, as Wrath of Ragnaros also deals 1k damage.
---
I'm not sure if this was mentioned in the linked thread, but I use [this](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/raid-guids-for-ony) to track the raid's GUIDs.
---
I play in Netherwind, and all of the numbers suggest that the Horde dominate in numbers, but I can tell you from my experience, that Alliance control all of the contested territories.
---
Really? You have to be the most patient person then. I don't care about their honor, I just want to get where I want to be without being killed every 10 seconds.
---
Goldshire retriever. You are remembered!
---
You dont understand. 
---
You dont have to be good at all or dedicate all your time to get to ranks where you can get rewards you want. You can play 2-3 hours aday and eventually get rank 11 which is what iam aiming for. Just cus im doing alot off wpvp doesnt mean im gonna go for rank 14. My goal is rank 11 so i get full blue set and mount.
---
To be clear:  A rogue camping a flight-point for easy one-sided kills is accusing somebody else of being a pathetic loser.
---
.... riiiiiight
---
Bye
---
Youre pretty bad if youre getting killed by locks or priests my dude.
---
Its just that simple. You are bad, playing an OP class, claiming balance shouldnt be a thing in a game that is all about conflict. 
---
Thats just an idiotic stance. 
---
Maybe we should throw it all out. Priests can outheal anyone, Hunter pets are statted out like elites if they tamed one, rogues get instant death poison, warlocks steal your soul and you cant revive anymore...
---
Dont worry though, its an RPG, itl be *fine*
---
While im pulling it's more important to reduce damage taken, that's why i keep Dev aura up, also with this particular instance i would probably end up killing a few of the mobbs too early if i was using Retribution aura.
---
 But once i have the mobbs in position and i start killing them i guess it would be good to swap over to ret aura at that point, would have maybe saved me a few seconds but the mobbs die pretty quick regardless.
---
Do you even play the game or just an hordie ?
---
You have to wait 5 minutes before you get unflagged while capitals are full of rogues.
---
&gt;Mana Igniting Cord
---
depends on how you weigh stats for BIS. I've seen some BIS lists for mage / warlock that actually have Banthok for waist...
---
Same on Faerlina, Ruins of Lordaeron are camped most of the time by a gank squad of 4-6 allies who will hide in the tunnels.  Then they'll scatter back into WPL if any force comes for them, then come back in 10-15 minutes. 
---
Absolutely right its now worth dealing with if you're not already rolling in deep with 5+ players, just unflag and move on.  No one cares to flag themselves for a few honor only to then get ganked by the solo rogues and druids in UC that camp the auctioneers.
---
You're not wrong,  but they're more important in classic than they are in retail because of the lack of a LFG tool or any cross-realm PvE.
---
&gt;for literally zero gain
---
It's fun. 
---
&gt;I think I just expected PvP to mean PvP
---
??
---
I just remember the primary rule of playing a rogue: pillage BEFORE you burn.
---
Oh, camping and zergs absolutely happened. With 1/3 the amount of people. Important little detail you're missing. 
---
I'm Horde on a Horde dominated server. Not having a rough go of it at all, but nice attempt to discredit my argument.
---
&gt; Holy shit you are delusional :D :D
---
Right back at ya, bud. We're all humans behind the screen but a lot of you guys choose to act negatively and are somehow surprised that other people disagree with it
---
I like the part where you believe this is exclusive to the alliance.
---
That’s what I did, but never had problems finding groups. I bought invisibility and running potions. Those help ALOT
---
Am I the only one thinking that the lower populated fraction will have a better time once BG goes live ?
---
I mean, the BG queues will be horrible for horde when there is a 60:40 ratio, wont they ?
---
It's not an extreme waste of time. People grinding for rank 14, can get ahead of everyone and get rank 14 the first week they are able to. Most of the top honor farmers on our server are camping MC/brd or the road between diremaul and the horde town with 5-10 people, It's definitely great honor.
---
Overall I think Phase 3/4 will be the most enjoyable. Most will be able to do the content just fine and in terms of gear and PvP balance it's best during these phases - once people start getting AQ/NAXX gear it just becomes a oneshot-fest.
---
I wonder if it's got anything to do with this?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4ncss/an_addon_called_honorspy_is_completely_breaking/
---
The Brazilian community on classic is huge, the problem like other fellow redditors said is that Blizz took a long time to release a "all BR server", once they released most of the BR players were spread among the servers.
---
I went PVE server and made Mankrik my home (since Blizz had 0 PVE servers for the BR community). I convince some old friends to re-roll here and made a Horde guild on Mankrik called &lt;Força e Honra&gt;, any person here who is tired of the PVP servers or the lack of player to do content are welcome to re-roll on Mankrik with us.
---
Since P2 started, we had 30+ people re-rolling there and most of then are like level 45+ right now, soon we will be able to make 2 raid cores if more people join.
---
Besides that, the server is real health and you will always find people to run stuff. We have a good relationship with the North American players on the server and we are here to break the stereotype that "all the BR players are toxic", not all are toxic, we don't like to play with this kind of player either.
---
If you are interested of rolling with us, PM me on discord or look for Folley in-game (horde side).
---
Half the players don’t automatically stop playing the game when two layers are merged.
---
The gameplay we pay a monthly subscription for :)
---
I just let him run in and die and then after im like hey dude i was drinking.
---
Right but ZF is very farmable, and also more convenient since you are already questing in Tanaris at that level. You can be out questing/grinding while your group fills etc.
---
SoS is basically just a horde zone, there’s like 4 alliance quests there.
---
 /laughs in pve server
---
&gt;	you can do better farms than ZF. 
---
DM North? Any others?
---
They're basically causing people to drop off with this shit
---
orc priest lmao
---
TBC i'm not 100% sure, around wrath i think that the concurrent cap was indeed larger, i don't know if its 8k though. I played on a high / full server back then and it always felt busy but not crowded like you see in Classic these days.
---
Better than being corpse camped atleast  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Petty ignorant toxic response.   
---
Why would someone be in front of the tank?
---
and when does the healer get to loot trash mobs if he isnt allowed to be behind you at any point ?
---
People that think Bgs will fix the faction inbalance in any way. I am sorry, but if your faction is below 30% RIGHT NOW abandon ship as fast as you can.
---
+Player attrition
---
+pvp attrition
---
= jump now
---
Sorry, but tanking in wow isn't about taking the least damage possible.
---
Depends of your gear i did it with only a couple of mana pot. You can cheese the silithus demon if you have a warlock friend to duel and curse you so you cant be feared, but if you dont get a shadow protection potion this guy fear hurts a bit
---
Maybe 10 years ago I wouldve raged, but I'm so numb to it now. If I die, it's just like okay whatever.
---
I recall using my partial FR set for the trash packs in latter half of MC, but it was mainly put together for Firemaw in BWL. Was certainly never required for MC on anything but the tanks. Didn't really even need it for Firemaw, but it allowed me to sit in his aura and dps more as opposed to stepping out and shooting him a few times and then hiding for the debuff to reset.
---
Standing at the back of a group is a mistake new healers make. It's not entirely poor reasoning, you don't want to be the one that pulls and if something happens you don't want aggro or to die either. If you don't trust your group, or your own abilities, it's a good defensive play. 
---
But when you've got some tank and dps you can trust and you've learned how to manage your mana, you want to be up at the front to be gaining mana while the group runs forward. If you're in the back, you're always chasing and you lose all that drinking time.
---
Why not both? Less time than reset’ ing after a wipe
---
For the last time.... !!!!! (no, not really)
---
players NEVER give Dishonorable kills! NEVER!
---
If you have your epic mount, and the glove/boot enchant and carrot on a stick. You shouldn’t be getting run down if you are paying attention to your surroundings. Sometimes you may path poorly and they can catch up. But they also won’t chase you indefinitely.
---
Aw, you can't figure out the macro to reckbomb, this is so sad :(
---
So how long do you plan to hit rank 11? How do you farm honor and do you enjoy the 2-3 hours a day?
---
I dont think you understand what im trying to say, my math is simple because what im explaining IS simple. 
---
Im saying that when an alliance has percentually more players than the horde, the percentage different is also higher towards the Allianca than the Horde on Horde dominant servers. 
---
By counting all the 10 percentage together and then dividing it by 10 again, i get the average percentage alliances have in servers they are dominant in. 
---
So when the alliance dominate a server, on average its 69.8% vs 30.2% but when the horde dominate a server, on average its 67.9% vs 32.1%
---
I disagree. Because then every discussion about difficulty is moot. When there are plenty of difficult things in this game. And the game was not beaten by us when we where 12. In fact i believe less than 1% beat naxxramas. And most never even did molten core.
---
They definitely weren't decent. Letting spamstring/cripp poison wear off a hunter is death.
---
The brain damage on some of the r/classicwow users is unreal
---
 The problem is your inequality is wrong. 1080 &lt; 2080, that should compile.
---
&gt;in Un'Goro, that there is only ever a single Rich Thorium vein active at a time
---
I can confirm that its possible to have at least 2 up at the same time, SW ungoro both visible on my minimap.
---
&gt;I've seen some people theorise that veins are grouped up into sectors, so the one in the south-west of Un'Goro must have the 14-16 Rich veins and a couple of mithril veins, with only 1 node being active at a time per sector.
---
This was my theory as well up until I found the 2 nodes, it might still be true but SW un goro could also be made up of multiple sectors. I can also confirm that at least some of them share spawns with other mining nodes, off the top of my head theres one spawn in the middle of ungoro that can either be truesilver or rich thorium.
---
Whatever the mechanics are I would not be surprised if there was also a random/dynamic element to node respawn.
---
Most just domo (eye and leaf) as we are all uparound on folks needing the items.
---
&gt; I don't know if I would call those immora
---
I mean if you can't call people who deliberately seek to create misery in others immoral, I don't know know who you CAN even call immoral anymore. That's like textbook sociopathy.
---
Yeah, I don't know what OP is talking about. I'm Horde on Heartseeker and we literally can not enter any zone to farm/level solo unless it's like 3am.
---
Fire prot pots do fuck all for tanks. We are only on our third clear this week so we're still taking every advantage we can get. I don't understand how this relates to the topic though.
---
You were lucky to not be following [Watcher Cutford.](https://youtu.be/IPTMTFY4KiA?t=60)
---
Well, I am talking about the game long term. Even if it's at a decent spot now, the imbalance will just get worse over time, and it's people's attitudes that are making it happen faster than anything else.
---
You must realize that people feel frustrated in game, and when you see the same pointless rhetoric in forums/reddit over and over, then it's understandable that some people quit.
---
I don't spam posts wishing the game should change, I'm not naive enough to believe they would actually make any changes. But I think that shutting up people who are venting, is not really productive either. The game is imbalanced, and people have a right to vent about it, the loud people who claim there's nothing wrong are the ones that are actually contributing the a hastened process of faction imbalance. 
---
And again, my  initial post was about the silly rhetoric we keep seeing on reddit and the forums.
---
Using an exploit to rez, heal, rebuff, and drink is an exploit and not fair.
---
Sure bud. If that's all you got it:
---
&gt; U mUsT bE bAd.

Arms warriors aren't OP. They weren't OP back in classic when I stomped on them, they aren't OP now that I'm playing against them.

Paper
---
If you want samey "balance" where every class is balanced against each other, go back to retail. It's waiting for you.
---
It might not make the difference now but as you push toward higher level dungeons you'll find that it'll be the difference you need - particularly when it comes to SM Cathedral pulls :P that shit isn't easy
---
From what I’ve seen on here I think mankrik might be the largest horde PVE community. I know Pagle is pretty popular but mostly alliance dominated. 
---
I play on westfall and it is skewed towards alliance. There are horde out there and I’ve seen a couple of larger guilds running around. 
---
Hopefully someone else can weigh in with some of the other servers.
---
\&gt; I don't mean to come across as...a dick, but \*I will regardless\*
---
Yes, there will still be complaining. People always have something to complain and it is impossible to please everyone.
---
BUT
---
BGs are more condensed areas where PvP happens. So it is a fair assumption that the world pvp will calm down a bit. No, it will not die. Yes, you will still corpsewalk once or twice to get into BRM but it should be much better than before.
---
Those who rolled on a PvP Server but are not very interested in PvP (such as me) will be happy that there will come an alternative for the honor grind.
---
Thank you for pointing this out, it helps me remind myself to be careful with my wording and, obviously, keep account for what I'm trying to defend in order to not contradict myself.
---
I am in no place to tell people what to do, because what's going on is, ultimately, allowed in the game. Therefore, imposing how I play (or how I think we should play) would be detrimental to the inherent freedom that the game allows.
---
I did say ethics are personal, as stated by the very first definition of ethics that google gives, for example:  *moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or the conducting of an activity* . That is to say, not because I think something is wrong and I wouldn't do it myself, you will stop doing it. You need to work on your own ethics, or moral laws, in order to change your behaviour (or not change it, if those moral laws are accepting of your behaviour).
---
Finally, and perhaps at the risk of making myself a hypocrite once more, there are certain universal laws that we all *could accept as such*, and in such a sense, giving some objectivity to something so subjective. I believe we all can say that torturing an animal for the sake of it is wrong. Or killing pregnant women because it's a 2x1. Or raping children aged 4. In the example I gave (bound to critics and opinions, as I have been alarmed before), I was supposing that hating someone just for the sake of it (even if you've always been taught that way) is, or should be, universally considered wrong.
---
&gt; Important little detail you're missing.
---
No, no. I experienced it. 
---
Decade and a half ago.
---
Open up keybinds, I'm not sure which it falls under but the name of the bind is "assign X to Target" it might be under misc but I'm at work and can't check.
---
I was actually thinking of dropping a bunch of gold on black lotus because I thought they’d increase value in later phases, but the consensus seems to be that nobody will bother using them if the prices are anywhere near what they are now.
---
That’s what happens when low pop servers are more in line with the vanilla population of a server.
---
You sound like you dislike PvP. Even when someone points out that any player with a dishonorable kill could use it aggressively and hugely impact someone that may not have even camped them you cannot see how that is wrong. 
---
Seriously, if you dislike PvP and are calling for dishonorable kills to be on players you need to play on a PvE realm. It is the solution to your problem, not dishonorable kills. 
---
If you are so hellbent on trying to fix the current honor system, dishonorable kills is NOT the solution. A possible solution? Everyone gets 1,000 honor per week. When you die to an opponent you are allowed to grant some honor to them. The minimum is 5, the maximum is 1,000. 
---
This forces some reward, but also forces people to try and have honorable combat. 
---
Dishonorable kills on players is a downright horrible idea, and many other options would be a better solution(If we are changing anything).
---
well for me, not a single friend quit after P2 until now.
---
but 80% of them unsubbed one month in.
---
You do need to understand that Warrior is the most frustrating class to play in the game.  It is extremely rewarding, as you are very much valued as a player, but everyone likes to backseat tank.  I often find when I tank I go "too slow" because I keep an eye on the healer's mana, and wait for near full to go to the next mob.  You aren't "stance dancing" enough, "why can't you hold aggro?" (says the mage spamming cone of cold), "are you prot spec?", "use thunderclap to hold aoe aggro".  It is non-stop sometimes.
---
I love tanking when I have a guild group or a good group of competent players, but when you get in "that" pug, sometimes you just want to get it over with as quick as possible.  
---
Tanks are expected to lead, know every pull by heart, never have a taunt resisted, micro-manage every CC strategy, and never complain about dps being low.  
---
If I could get one message across to my fellow dungeon mates, USE CC ON EVERY PULL.  Things go so much smoother with a sheep or a sap or a hunter trap.  We were having a hell of a time in UBRS, where I was OT, and we just weren't communicating, the mages were antsy to do the next pull, nobody was sheeping, etc.  We got a hunter in, yelled at the mages to sheep each pull, and the hunter was a PRO with the traps, and we started moving about 100% faster through the instance.
---
Tell that to the Russians.
---
I think the price may crash once bwl is released due to people listing but we'll see
---
Right now for MC almost no one is flasking so lotuses are being horded
---
The whole point of rank 14 is to show that you have No life and are willing to go to extreme lenghts to get better gear than your casual plebs. You know... The exact reason people been screaming their head of for classic.. Purple gear matters.
---
You are using spy, you are in no position of whining on anyone when you are using a all but in name cheating addon.
---
I'm mostly just doing it to hang out with the guild for an hour a night, I'm a hunter, we don't get much from honor. The tabard would be nice. My GM (shadow priest) is farming the EPL flight path all day because he's going for R13 for gear and right now the best way to do that is to camp in small raid groups. He's not doing it for the fun, but doing anything with friends makes it fun. When BGs come out that changes, we can actually start playing PVP like a real game.
---
Is this just a repost of the same video from weeks ago?
---
yes, this is useless :D
---
I'm a warrior and solo farming outside of instances in P2 hasn't been possible except through attrition or very specific times.  Honestly, it's not a bad thing, it has forced me to network with complementary professions to hold an area and PvP to control it.  It feels rewarding holding onto a prime farming location that otherwise isn't possible while alone.
---
Ally carebears need to stop bitching about PVP on PVP servers. Get better at the game and stop whining
---
&gt; After hearing that, I started marking targets for people so they could see aggro range better. I started marking targets for packs that I thought people might pull by mistake.
---
Instructions unclear: *"starts to pull all the marked targets"*
---
Enjoying ganking + being able to call yourself a “real” player (whatever that means) is why 90% of people roll pvp servers
---
I can't speak to faction balance, but then...faction balance matters WAY less for PVE.  I'm on Windseeker, horde side, and haven't had any issues finding guilds/groups/raids.  But I can't compare to other PVE servers...we're not the low pop server, somewhere in the midddle.
---
Hello!
---
Are there any PvE servers (EU) that do regular MC/Ony PUGs? My current one is a bit quiet.
---
I believe it's called "Mark Raid Target" or something similar in the keybind options, there's an option for each icon.
---
Yeah but walking into IF is way easier for horde than walking into Org for alliance to be fair
---
"The economy isn't necessary, who cares if it's completely broken?"
---
Yes i included the pve servers, the site dont have them marked as PVE or PVP so it slipped my mind. So yea this is useless ;D
---
I do this to Horde lowbies because Horde is easy mode, and they deserve to be griefed. I have No clue why Horde players do it though.
---
Can I ask your method on SM ruin? As I'm guessing you rely less on your pet and go more dps? Do you sacrifice vw?
---
Right, our guild has mc on farm, every priest has this already, eos is the problem, this is super easy to get.
---
Had a few of those too
---
A blue post stated that a "medium" population classic server has more players than the "most populated" vanilla server did. Considering a lot of servers are high still, it's safe to assume that the current player capacity is a lot higher than it was in vanilla.
---
Cross realms BG confirmed...so there's no downside horde players will be seeing....
---
It doesn't population is actually 50/50 across all server (Which is pretty impresive). You think theres more horde population, because PvP server are dominated by horde. And PvP servers are the only place where faction imbalance matters. So theres constant bitching from alliance side.  
---
 Both PvE - RP servers have more Alliance players

It was a compliment. I commented because I want you and similar posters know that it’s a tired trope

Armor and dodge... might as well wear the carrot
---
You need yourself a geared feral tank.
---
Expectations of not camping lowbies are in no way unrealistic and unreasonable.
---
So many people are already stockpiling lotus predicting an increase in price for real raids that im pretty sure the price will actually not move.
---
Just be careful about putting markers on too soon.  Sometimes dps can get a little trigger happy and jump on marked targets.
---
Blizzard would actually make more money off the botters if they banned asap.
---
Instead they let them impact the server qualities and make people quit or jack up economies with gold selling.
---
Why?  Because blizzard hasn't put a serious amount of resources into classic, even with news that it was their biggest quarterly sub increase ever, they'll just coast and brag about profit margins and classic wow will continue to be a joke intended for plebs that never actually played vanilla so they can't really compare how awful things are now.
---
I read this an all I'm thinking is,  "He could have been in SM and probably ended his day at lvl 42 or higher".
---
Nothing quite as refreshing as a constant stream of "there's %oppositefaction in my capital city!"
---
as they should be. the sub has enough shitty memes, as if we need even more.
---
They arent, 2h arms tank away through it all. Just have a macro to switch to shield and def stance when you need to taunt, you need to let the healer catch up, or the mobs hit hard. Its rarely needed.
---
Very good thread. However I think it'll fall mostly on deaf ears, since most people completely turn off their moral compass when it comes to online interactions.  "It's fine, it's not like I'm killing him in real life, no harm done" they probably think to themselves as they shit all over the experience of someone who similarly waited for 14 years in order to re-experience vanilla and promptly unsubscribes.
---
Then you have the sociopaths who actually enjoy this and I don't think our moral critique of their character really affects them all that much, sadly.
---
&gt; Will blizzard speed up the spawn rate of the Lotus in the upcomin phases?
---
Go on...
---
There's one server that's Alliance dominated - your faction doesn't get a free pass for being absolute shitheels because of that. It's not 100% a faction thing, sad fact is the majority of toxic players come from horde - surprise surprise it's because it's the most popular faction.
---
Stop trying to write-off horrible player behavior on horde side as "but they would do it too!" Why is it so hard to just NOT be an asshole? That's fucking factionless, acting like a decent person.
---
Then correct me. Don't take a shit and walk away without wiping. I use [wowdownrank.com](https://wowdownrank.com), it does the math for me.
---
I'm not the one crying a river that would put Darrowmere to shame bud. 
---
I'm not having issues, I just don't think it's anywhere near as bad as you cry. 
---
If your only argument is "An arms warrior who loses is bad", then you have no real argument. There's plenty of ways to beat them, and I have been on both the giving, and receiving, end.
---
Play more, cry less, or go back to retail.
---
&gt;then lets go all out.
---
This is called hyperbole, and it's not an argument. In this instance if I make $1/hr and you make $.90/hr then why should I not make $500/hr? After all it's still not balanced!
---
Yeah I hear this line echoing in my head during all the p2 complaints a LOT, lol.
---
The only reason i look at this sub is to get a laugh. BFA snowflakes complaining about everything. And yes i play alliance on 40/60 server with horde dominating.
---
21 Bleed damage over 7 weeks isn't going to do a thing for threat per second!
---
Good point. Start with moon and square before getting to skulls and x.
---
No. Zf is mostly vendor based and doesn't rely on the economy much. Zf also provides a lot of cloth which you can ah, vendor, or turn to bandages and vendor. It's also close to a vendor and repair. Hearth in gadget, port everywhere else. 
---
Some would say lasher farming but that is rng and econ based. Also only in smaller time slot windows.
---
I was herb/alch and did not switch. You could get the Robe of Winter Night and just call it a day. It may depend on your guild, though.  My alt is a mage, and I’ve gone mining and gnomish engineering.  As soon as I finish making all the gnome stuff I want, I’m going to drop it and pick up tailoring for Robe of the Archmage. Then, it’s back to engineering and the goblin route.
---
They probably just want to play a nice game of tag
---
They did it with devilsaur, dont see why they wont with black lotus.
---
I got pretty bored of my mage after hitting 60 because of the one button rotation so I rolled a warrior instead. Dps rotation is pretty fun and fury warriors are always needed for some reason plus you can tank for easy dungeons while leveling.
---
I always love posts like this. As if Alliance doesn’t do the same thing, you just don’t see it.
---
We had two Alli Druids lockdown Splintertree for over ten hours multiple nights a week. I even logged to my main, killed the Alliance multiple times and they didn’t care, they would rez, two shot lowbies in the 25-30 range, get killed and just do it again.
---
Oh i didn't consider Alliance a choice haha
---
I don't see how you can quadruple the amount of active people playing on a server and have the static 1x amount of resources.
---
How did they think this was okay?
---
Also the mana biscuits are food and water.  Saves on bag space when you can double up.
---
QQ
---
Lol, that guy will burn out before he even makes it to rank 8, lol
---
My GM wants R13 as soon as possible, at which point he can stop. The honor is out there and ready to get right now, why wouldn't he go get it? Maybe it's a good time for him, maybe he wants to do a few weeks of this and a few weeks of BGs to break it up.
---
People do a *lot* in WoW you might not consider fun. Some people hate leveling altogether. Some people can't stand farming for gold, others do it 5 hours a day because they know it will make the game fun later on. Is the winterspring sabre rep grind "fun" in of itself? Not really, but people feel an immense satisfaction when it's done.
---
The heroic Herod Horde hoards harrowing herbs
---
Yes, but very easy quest. Kill scarshield quartermaster, loot letter, accept quest, go to ubrs, touch orb behind last boss, that’s it.
---
Just saw your comment after writing the same thing. :D
---
MMOs are always ruined by MMO players.
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
We've been clearing MC and Ony weekly and never really had to have assignments save for "Big heals on X" for any fight other than Domo and Rag. Even then it's just tank heals and raid heals for domo and location based heals for Rag.
---
I just browse this place to justify my choice of rerolling on a PvE server
---
Are you referring to the post made on August 16th, or the post made on August 21st?  Both were made before the game was released, so it was obvious they were talking about characters created, not concurrent players.
---
Bolsonaro sounds like a great reason not to do any business actually inside Brazil. How shit is your ping anyways, I have no problem on US servers playing from EU.
---
I would suggest running each dungeon as DPS first, to understand the routing/pulls, and then respec to fury/arms raiding DPS build (if you want to DPS in endgame) and work on collecting tank gear as a second set.  Use item rack to handle item switching, and tank with sword and board.  DEFINITELY get tactical mastery, as stance dancing with dodges, mocking blow, whirlwind are good for tanking groups, and you can hold on to more rage that way.
---
Honestly, the biggest problem with tanking as fury/arms is not having good enough gear.  If you are BIS for raid DPS as fury, you will get destroyed as a tank, because you will have low armor.
---
It will always be a shit show, learning the pulls/routes and getting a good tanking set will really help with tanking 5 mans.
---
Skull 1 x is 2 orange is sap moon is sheep and purple is a pather. 
---
This the same for every server ?
---
How did you get viskag AND perditions? You should be swords or daggers... not both..
---
As compared to the current system where there is no griefing.
---
Was a good laugh tbf, managed to juke the druid a bit whilst running around a tree and then hit with bear charge.
---
I truly hope I didn't come off as imposing my beliefs and wanting to make everyone play a certain way, because that's as farthest as it can get from what I was trying to do. I have a point of view on a topic, which I tried to expose with (wrongly worded, awfully presented) some arguments. I thrive in other's points of view, because it enriches mine!
---
Question for you as someone who's trying to really figure out mage (I leveled single-target), how would a mage go about soloing something like Mara without pulling aggro from everything trying to get into the instance? How can a mage even go about soloing some of the bosses?
---
They don't care? They are releasing battlegrounds ahead of schedule in direct response to the issues with phase 2.
---
That is because for preraid-BiS, basically anything but spellpower is irrelevant you get (as you pointed out) the most SP on the green "frozen wrath" items. In early raids fights are so short that mana is no issue, so there is 0 concern with regen or manapool. crit is pretty much absent from preraid gear aswell. So it makes sense to go for bracers, cloaks, helmets, boots of "frozen wrath" affixes.
---
It is if you played WoW before Cata.
---
The problem for me is it causes my UI to trigger that I am missing buffs on raid members that I am responsible for.
---
You are correct, that's how it should work and that's the correct way to do the rotation unless you're opening up on someone in a scatter shot or ice trap.
---
What are you seeing that's different?
---
Last night, Alliance dominated Feralas, Horde groups were getting picked by and taken apart by the same group of 5 ally. The entrance to DM was being camped by this party and no matter how many horde we threw against them, we couldn’t get through.
---
In general chat: “horde dominated server btw.“ “maybe in pol, not in pvp skill.”
---
Downvote me, I don’t care, but the fact is that alliance pvpers, the hardcore ones, lay waste to horde as roaming parties. From the horde point of view, they make it look like the easiest thing in the world. A lot of players on horde side Skeram aren’t pvp centric and get farmed.
---
Tanks should have some FR gear for it.
---
It's unrelated to main topic but you brought up the FR buff scheme.
---
But if you are struggling on rag then I guess this makes sense.  You will find it gets easier when your raid starts gearing up.  Is everyone but the tanks using the fire prots?
---
Thanks for publicly sharing this common knowledge to everyone else. Exactly what I wanted to see, more horde on Herod camping gate, thanks.
---
&gt; My GM was the #4 horde on our server last week from camping the EPL FP because his Rank 13 gear is insane. 
---
He used rank 13 gear this week? Just want to clarify this statement before making my next less-civil comment....
---
They don't, a big portion of the classic dueling tournament is literally held outside of the map.. noone of them has been suspended. You're talking out of your arse.
---
Well with these mega servers you're sure to see some people with it, as a lot of runs are being done. But yes, getting it for yourself is pretty unrealistic. Back in Vanilla/TBC I saw 1 person with it, before they buffed the droprate in Wrath. In classic I've seen 5 people with it as I said. Maybe my server is an anomaly I don't know.
---
The most overlooked thing here is probably predictive heals.
---
It's almost impossible to heal efficiently without knowing who is already having a heal casted on them.
---
I think this is the primary source of OP's issue, he simply doesn't know who is already being healed.
---
Getting a decent dagger at 60 is a pain in the ass. If you want to raid as daggers, your options are Heartseeker, Perdition’s Blade, or Core Hound Tooth. Practically every other 60 dagger is off an insanely rare boss (dark knight deathreaver) or comes with a shitty DoT/debuff proc that sidelines it entirely due to the boss debuff limit.
---
Gnomes are just creepy in general but it does come across as some demonic doll here haha
---
None of your response was anything I've addressed in my comment, though. And my comment does not excuse in any way poor game design. 
---
My comment is only to point out that each player must carry some responsibility for their choice to engage in the game in such a way that poor game design so negatively affects them. That is all. It's not *all* the responsibility, just some of it. 
---
It's a false dichotomy to say that there's only playing one's main toon and not playing WoW at all. Many, many people enjoy playing a variety of toons, so much so, in fact, that there is a name for it: "altoholic". 
---
And on a personal level, yes, it very much *is* about being relaxed and having fun. Why else are you playing a game? Are you a chinese slave labor worker forced to work in gold-farming sweatshops? Or do you have the personal autonomy to decide that you are going to spend some of your leisure time playing a game? It's the personal responsibility of that personal choice that I'm demanding in my comment.
---
My man
---
as a priest main leveling a rogue atm I can tell you giving healers tips seems to hold the same reaction :\\  
---
Tried to explain to a priest that spamming flash heal was horribly mana efficient and he basically told me to eff off before leaving group.
---
Sorry but alot of people (including OP) are missing the bigger picture and, frankly, just plane wrong.
---
My argument was things should be reasonably balanced. Youre argument is "Nuh uh, its an RPG"
---
The irony of that is, youre saying Nuh Uh while playing one of the strongest classes. 
---
You just want to sit there and claim things are fine, while you have it easy. 
---
Its ok, its ok. I know you are having a hard time understanding that, and making up other excuses to try and divert away from the actual point being made because you cant argue against it other than "I dont like blance"
---
Which is just a shitty opinion, held by a shitty person, who cant back it up in any way.
---
I mean I’m on skeram and I don’t think I’ve seen anyone with it
---
Lol getting downvoted for saying thanks x)
---
It's interesting that this was not possible in Vanilla. It is possible now, since they scrapped the vanilla scripting/macro stuff and just took the modern one and tried to strip out any new features from it. This means we end up with a situation where there are things you could do in Vanilla that you can't do now, and things you couldn't do that you can now. I don't know if it's a fair trade off, but I have no issue using it. This is a new game.
---
Its a video game, not a Parisian salon. Ethics doesn't enter into any of it.   
---
These carebear arguments destroy world pvp in every single mmo. Every. single. one. 
---
In 8 days BGs will be out and you and Kant and the rest of the crybullies can go afk at a FP in relative peace. 
---
But I don't expect you to listen or even worse, l2p. Just cluck some more about pvp happening on a pvp server.
---
Should have ended with being ganked again.
---
Yeah that shits lame as fuck. Nobody help this guy lol.
---
Mages and warriors have a higj demand though, rogues are an irrelevant joke class
---
Yes, it's a reference
---
You address my comment about a present choice with an argument about a past choice. I did not say "everybody who chose to roll on a pvp server..." I said "everybody who chooses to play on a pvp server..."
---
The people that do the most will be the first people to hit their desired rank, and then stop altogether... making it progressively easier. When those 500 people reach 13/14, there isn't a fresh crop of 500 people that spring from the ground to replace them.
---
Agreed everyone just fuckin bitches
---
Yeah but it's not like I'm planning to do this the rest of my life, I'll most definitely get bored of it sooner or later.
---
real shit rh
---
I refuse to believe the resist chance is only 5%
---
Is this even bannable?
---
I had a kill last night where I only got knocked 2-3 times, was able to intercept back every time. I run with about 280-290 fire resist and our main tank is capped (315) I think.
---
Prot Pallies can get away with it too depending on level.
---
Hey I’m on that server too .. you can Join my guild if you don’t have a good one. We have so many people your level roaming together right now .. including me in your range . Pm me if you want , if not I understand !
---
Mages have four main reagents on them:
---
-	Runes for teleportation
---
-	Runes for portals
---
-	Arcane dust for brilliance
---
-	Light feathers for slow fall
---
Most keep some combination of single-target spell damage gear and mana-focused farming gear with them, but you obviously don't need to keep that in your bags at all times.
---
You probably are the right person to ask this, so....   
---
Are cell phone pictures more accepted on the fortnite subs?
---
It's not for raiding, it's for grinding. You certainly wouldn't take it with Demonic Embrace, but neither SM/Ruin or Nightflag have the points to spare for embrace. However for solo or small group play when you actually gear for it, Imp DS is freaking nuts. I even like it in pvp since you can pick up some extra mana here and there rather than having to tap and bandage thus making yourself vulnterable, and you should be draining in pvp anyways since you go through a ton of soul stones.
---
Def horde, have arguably better pvp racials than alliance
---
The fact the honor system is broken was discussed MANY times before there was even a release date.  I highlighted the issue, not knowing at the time we would have 5x the original population.  This is a complex problem that can be fixed with subtle changes, but hey I voted no changes.  So with my previous knowledge, from a decade on pvp private realms, I rolled a PVE realm knowing this shit show would happen.  
---
I was ridiculed for my opinions, I was shouted down for my thoughts and replies, because of hive mind mentality of people on this sub.    
---
Blizzard made a small issue huge by making many mistakes, they started by increasing the pop caps, they didnt have any form of faction management as realms were released, they released the honor system with no BG's.  
---
I look forward to their next mistake of letting people transfer from pvp&gt;pve realms, and the shit that will cause.... and I really think this will be announced sooner than you think.
---
Every sub for every game I play quickly devolves into a whinefest.
---
What class are you? What race?
---
Warrior? Human?
---
I jump off the boats after the loading screen and swim just to deny them a little honor.
---
Alright, you're correct in saying that on that alliance are dominating servers harder on the servers that they are actually dominating.
---
Now let me answer the question of the title of the thread.
---
"Why so many Alliance complain threads?"
---
Well, lets start off by analyzing every single server instead of just NA servers. This is a forum where both EU and NA has the major attendance in. 
---
Secondly, players on PvE servers are not going to have complaints here, because they can choose to not get dominated by simply using a game feature of not turning on PvP flag.
---
We'll go by your rules of what servers to look at and ONLY include servers that are 60/40 or worse.
---
In this case it is correct what you are saying.
---
Alliance average domination number is 67.55% and horde average domination number is 66.34%!! Alliance is averaging a whopping 1.2% more domination on the servers that they are dominating!
---
So... Back to the question
---
Good question. I forgot to mention some important little data. The horde average domination were calculated by dividing 1525.9% by 23. That means that there are 23 servers that fulfill the criteria of being PvP forced as well as horde dominated by 60/40 or worse. The alliance average domination were calculated by dividing 270.2% by 4. That means there are 4 servers that fulfil the critera of veing PvP forced as well as alliance dominated by 60/40 or worse. 
---
Now lets do some simple innocent mathematics and lets ignore the fine print that server population may vary.
---
Lets divide 23 by 4. 23/4=5.75.
---
This means that for every 1 person that are dominated by alliance on a pvp server as a horde, there are 5.75 alliance players that's being dominated on a pvp server as an alliance.
---
If you can not comprehend at this point why there are so many alliance complaint threads, I'm sorry but there is simply no way I can help you understand that.
---
If you’re using powerful seaforium charge then it should absolutely work. That’s how I get in as a hunter with no key.
---
I feel like everyone should relax and wait to see what happens with bgs. If a week after the games still a miserable shit show then they can run in circles screaming about the falling sky. Personally I feel like they never should have released honor without bgs to begin with. And I also think they should just release AB with all the bg’s. 
---
That said: I don’t think que times are going to be that bad and if you’re banking on horde having massive ques as some sort of divine retribution than I think you’re gonna be disappointed. Back in vanilla even on servers with 60/40 imbalances or greater prior to cross realm the horde weren’t waiting longer then 10ish minutes. The only exception was AV sometimes, super low pop servers, or odd hours. 
---
Second a lot of y’all are not fully grasping this honor system. Bg wins honor gains make honor accumulation really efficient. HK’s are basically shit. You wanna win and as fast as humanly possible. Even as a pug if you’re grinding your goal is to carry as quick as humanly possible to ensure a victory and you begin to learn patterns to utilize to make this possible. I’m looking at how much honor some of y’all are acquiring grinding hard in a full day and a lot of that honor is shit I would acquire in like 2 hours of AV. No amount of camping flight paths are going to be efficient. That shit is straight chicken feed. So unless horde ques are in excess of 30 minutes it’s extremely improbable that every game an honor farm team is gonna que up fly to some zone kill 1-2 people and then get in their bg. It’d be pointless and they can’t even determine whether they’re getting an edge in ranking because those short hk’s may be inconsequential compared to another persons performance in harvesting hk in a bg (which no one even fucking tries to do).
---
People who are world pvping for honor will do so more efficiently in bg’s. People world pvping out of boredom will probably have more fun in bg’s. You’ll always have a few gankers. 
---
Tl:dr in vanilla the world was briefly miserable before bg’s came out. This will probably be the same situation.
---
I meant he does it for guildies not just any rando
---
Bottom line is that Blizz didn't put any thought into this system.  They thought if they released classic, the players would play the same way they did in vanilla.  Have people noticed that the pvp in hillsbrad is dead now?  Because people know that it isn't an efficient way to farm honor.  
---
For all the hate private servers get for being different, bottom line is  they are the much better comparison and someone from a pserver predicted what we are seeing today.  Blizzard has really messed up in p2 and hopefully ally come back for bgs, but if bgs come out and there's a long q, then horde will still gank and the game is in serious trouble.
---
Why would a guild need to still clear MC once AQ40 is out?  Surely by that point it is redundant for most cutting edge raiders?
---
I suppose there might be a few rare items (bindings, ingots etc.) you still need, but evon those I would have thought you would have by the time AQ40 is accessible.
---
It's rare and valuable. I'd guess 100g is the minimum you'd expect. Definitely shop it around and keep an eye on the AH for others.
---
Never heard of this and never played a warlock, how does this work?
---
Ok.
---
To replace that Brut blade...
---
Horde will also win the BG's. They have had so much control over so many servers that the Alliance are not going to be as geared nor have as much when it comes to Pots and other professions that require things to pick up in the world. Sure they "May" have longer wit times but they will be winning most of them too for awhile
---
Delete honor spy. More and more people have it which is why org, the most popular city came to a halt yesterday when it was overcrowded.
---
Everyone should immediately delete honor spy.
---
Yes it did. There weren't as many players on each server, but it happened.
---
Yeah, most players in vanilla were pretty shit. So I wouldn't trust a vanilla warrior to know. Maybe if you cleared naxx but even then
---
When you clicked on PvP for a realm, did you expect to be free from PvP?
---
You can call it griefing all you want, but the rules for PvP realms have been known for years. When you enter contested territory you have no promises of being safe. You also have the option to bring a group into contested territory and attack players. It is the defining difference. 
---
That is what people signed up for when they chose a PvP realm. It isn't the original classic experience, that was a horrible statement to parrot to new players. The classic experience was people playing on PvP servers and PvE servers. It was a very difficult decision that people made and changed how they enjoyed the game.
---
You could say that about literally anything. When I played on a private server, I had a few chinese friends. They all spoke english though, so of course they're going to have a more western viewpoint. When you played with chinese people who didn't speak english, it was a completely different player. 
---
Chances are if someone speaks english they're more educated. Your average BR player who only speaks Portuguese is notorious for being toxic.
---
It’s pretty dependent on what your class is. After hitting 60 on a lock with half of pre-bis being like 20g apiece on the ah I had the other half from dungeons in a week or two. Since then I’ve been doing mc and farming gold (have like 100 hks from a raid but mostly waiting for bgs) for 8 weeks. My pvp set is pretty much just the tier 1 pieces that I have 5/8 of since we just free roll them because they aren’t that great.
---
Warriors can’t farm gold as easily and I’m pretty sure you guys could be doing dungeons for like 6 months before you have all the pieces you want. Especially the guys going for a prot, fury, and arms set.
---
They should institute a "gripe" flair (and actually enforce it). That way we can filter out all the whining.
---
https://www.mmorpg.com/mobile/news.cfm?read=53738&amp;game=15&amp;ismb=1
---
There were a lot of players who tried to paint the picture of what Wpvp was like, but they did it with the intention of having more potential targets to kill.
---
It was rare that they explained that the thrill of having unexpected PvP fights against a fairly equal opponent, had to be tempered with class/specs built for ganking vs pve specs, 2+ vs you, 60 running wild in low level zones, and you at half health/mana with two tigers on you in STV when the "honorable fight" starts.
---
They tried to sell it like the most idealistic version of wPvP is the most common, when in reality it's the rarest form of it.
---
Never thought about that, thanks. How does this work with the Fel Lasher packs that also get aggroed when imps come?
---
As far as I understand, attacking people from where guards cannot reach is an exploit so simply being in a location like while taking actions while not in combat that do not put yourself into combat is not an exploit.
---
Lets just say I already worried about Naxxramas, when there simply is no better gear to get and you need the consumables. Back then I spent a lot more time farming than I am willing to spend this time (who again thought it was a good idea to allow almost all the different buffs to stack?), so I'm curious how we will fare. Then again I expect the population to shrink by a good amount until then, so maybe farming becomes a possibility at some point? Right now it feels pointless, because all the Lotus spawns are camped.
---
No...  I am already wasting enough time on corpse runs on the Priest.  To log on the Warlock with the sole purpose or chasing around low level characters in STV just adds to the time wasted and there really is no point in it.
---
For example...  There is a Horde shaman on my server well known to go grief/kill lowbies at Raven Hill in Duskwood.  Whenever 60s show up to kill him he seems like he actually enjoys it.  He tries to kill the 60 a few times (I think he is high 40s), then disappears for a bit - then pops back up as soon as the 60s leave.
---
If I were to log my Warlock on every time I die I’d never get any leveling accomplished.
---
? You can farm the mobs and they drop it too.
---
I just got gutgore ripper last night also! I've had Core Hound Tooth for several weeks now and was using that in my MH. Honestly though if you get gutgore, respec combat daggers and see how it compares to swords. Dont OH a 1.8 dagger as combat swords...
---
i like how you just say all rogues are noob basically.
---
You gotta expand on your point though, what scenarios do you think you are opted into pvp being on a pvp server?
---
Bring high stamina and FR gear for the lava packs following garr.  They can one shot you if your stamina is not high enough.  You can try and use your void walker for a bubble.  Most of the bosses, a  felhunter for an extra dispel is very good, especially if you are on point with it while your shadow bolts are firing. If it is a high damage output fight like ragnaros, again you will be better off with a bubble shield on your void walker.  If you are in the tank group, you will have to make sure you are in thirty yards of the tank to give him the imp buff, otherwise you are useless and not doing your job.  I personally do not use an imp on geddon even in the tank group and instead go with a felhunter for dispel magic on myself and other magic users.
---
Why did you post?  Just unsub
---
&gt;Releasing honor and bgs separately was a big change, they ain't mirroring shit here
---
There were two full months between the release of the honor system and the introduction of WSG and AV.
---
Hmmmmm I cant imagine a tank actually having 0.
---
Shave your butt?
---
I don't think they are on par. Far from it! Grizzly is for sure the dominant force, however, I mention Fusion because I frequently see them/deal with them as well. So I just see them as another group holding things together for the alliance lol.
---
Imp FD is not required, and from my experience, it makes little to no difference. I rarely see feign get resisted. More often I'm still holding down the right mouse key which effectively nullifies FD (because you break it as soon as it's cast and with spell batching the mobs ignore the feign.) 
---
When I stopped holding down right mouse I stopped seeing issues with feign. I've never specced into imp feign death.
---
Thanks for the reply! I'm mostly interested in using dungeons to finish leveling to 60 since it's kind of a gank fest at the moment. Do you think that's a feasible option or should I stick to open world questing?
---
Why are German rogues so jolly during the holidays?
---
It's all of the *gift*\-giving.
---
^(Dear god. Like, 3 people will get this.)
---
I'll look into it, thanks.
---
After a couple weeks of classic it seemed obvious that the old model would fall apart and that leagues would be awesome for pvp servers. Sadly i cant see blizz ever doing that...
---
I have bloodfang hood, Gutgore Ripper, and 3 t1 pieces. Otherwise it’s all preraid BiS. Bloodfang hood and gutgore ripper are the expensive ones though.
---
Would you be able to elaborate a bit more please?
---
For starts, /who [level range] [class] [zone] [guild]....lots of different filter options you can add.
---
BGs won’t fix this problem. 
---
Putting vanilla server caps won’t fix this problem. 
---
People have to understand it’s a 15 year old game that wasn’t perfect and now every exploit, bug, strategy is known to all with higher than average coordination to act on those things. 
---
Actual changes need to happen to the game to address those issues. 
---
It won’t happen because classic is a purity test and Blizzard isn’t going to do anything because it’s a no win situation.
---
Amazing that you think you have my entire raid style and play style figured out from one statement.  You’re wrong but ok...  keep trying.
---
I hate healing warlocks for this reason...
---
In Classic it's usually a period-ruining experience, especially because the person being ganked is immediately and indefinitely on the defensive at a disadvantage
---
I legit thought this was bait and the message when opened would simply be "git gud".
---
as a healer I can confirm this is exactly what I do
---
Scrolled too far to see if anyone else got the reference, glad I'm not the only one, love that movie 😁
---
Yup, being a warrior is pretty expensive and you don’t really have a lot of time left over to create an alt. I kinda want to make a warlock since they’re OP but I just got my mount, and I’m still on the grind to get lionheart helm &amp; SGC. Think I’m close to 100 BRD runs and haven’t seen it drop once.
---
Oh and also, once I get lion heart, i need to grind gold again to get cloudkeeper legs.
---
Considering that they created another server located in NA and slapped Brazil in the name, it seems that Blizzard created it to take the Brazillians off the other servers lmao
---
I do "believe" you. /Ponzi
---
I have a 19 priest 29 rogue 39 lock and 49 warrior all twinks and ready to go, 19 has agm.  Herod Horde.
---
Engineering yields the best resistance trinkets in the game... Which isn't even why they're good... Not that you even really need resistance to begin with. The fact you said the pot lasts you a phase means you're obviously not a tank, which also means you need little to no FR. 
---
Back out of ragnaros before wrath and take a few seconds before you go back in. 
---
This is a super weird post.
---
Let me put it this way, if your playing Counterstrike, do you stop shooting the dude who clearly can't play for fear that he will stop playing?   
---
Losing and dying should be a learning experience, it should teach you that PVP zones are dangerous and you shouldn't be soloing in them, get a group against players your level, get a guild against 60 tryhards, I regularly get called in to defend guildies who are levelling alts agains them.  
---
You're in the world of warcraft, it isn't supposed to be a bloodless environment, this is why PVP and PVE servers exist as in one PVP is not optional but a core part of the gameplay, the other faction is a constant risk that isn't really the game you've been playing in Modern wow, so I can see that it's a shock but that is how the game used to be and everything that is old is new again.
---
Again, I’m not saying it’s a bad way to make money. I’m just saying that claiming it’s 0% chance to die is a flat out lie and you shouldn’t claim that.
---
Personally, I think BWL will wreck a lot of the shittier guilds. (yes, the mechanics are easy, but managing 40 peoople isn't), not disband but it will be a lot more interesting than MC/Ony (hopefully).
---
The shitshow on ZG islands to collect the heart of Hakkar buffs will also be fucking glorious, when the alliance and horde raids who are stacking their wolrd buffs might end up facing each other and wiping each other out.
---
&gt; I’m hoping adding BGs solves many of the issues with World PVP but I’m really unsure.
---
I don't think it will reduce it as much as people think it will, as the efficient honor farmers will just put their hearthstone in Kargath or wherever, and just HS everytime after re-quing to keep wpvp while in queue for max efficiency.
---
&gt;absolutely dreading the shitshow that will be Silithus when AQ40 launches.
---
It will be the pre-AQ patch that has the real Silithus shitshow, when everyone wants to grind exalted with Cenarion Circle prior to AQ being released (good rewards on day 1 basically), and everyone is farming the windstone bosses 24/7 which are up to 40 man bosses.
---
If you need both to prevent a wipe...sure
---
Usually the fire prots are enough to get it done.  They are the key though.  The pot eats up the random fire hits
---
We're out there. I saw a guy the other day named something like sidecontrol. Had to message him, and sure enough he trains!
---
classic had made me fucking hate tanking now
---
Maybe true, but there's also the reputation that is nice to start gaining earlier. Anywho, it's still my alt so there's no rush really for me to get to 60. Thanks for your input :)
---
You’re just going to get CCed for the duration of your debuff. I don’t see how this changes anything.
---
They take over the org flight path.  Usually only 5 or so horde flag to fight them, but usually end up losing with 15+ non flagged horde standing by
---
NO CHANGES
---
*Blizz changes things to allow 3-5x the population*
---
ftfy
---
Maybe they expected it to be like it was in vanilla? Shocker, I know.
---
Bipolar and storm flasked for a couple times they tried to speedrun, but there's no reason to otherwise
---
Nothing comes without downsides. Strategically chosen server mergers would work a lot better than layers did, and massively huge populations are. Especially if they were upfront well in advance about how, when, and why server mergers would ever happen - this being the primary reason why people hated it before. 
---
This game was not made to have such insanely high populations per server, and we’re currently feeling the effects of that. Yes, back then the population sizes were pre-determined by what the physical server hardware could handle, but they designed and balanced the game around those limitations for years. Today they’re using virtual servers that could scale to use almost as much resources as they could possibly need in order to support much much larger populations, but the game design itself doesn’t scale as well, particularly when it comes to faction imbalance. 
---
Having a large faction imbalance like 60/40 or worse, is never a great thing. However the effects of the imbalance become VASTLY MORE pronounced with such a high population. It’s become easy for the dominant factions to just lock down most areas of the world, because they’re just so numerous. If the population was more like they were back in the day 2K-3K, you couldn’t realistically do that. You could lock down a single area maybe, but that would have left almost everywhere else in the world wide open. That’s what we saw back in the day, and what we’re not seeing today. This makes the smaller faction hate the game and quit, making the faction imbalance even worse. It becomes a vicious cycle with no end. 
---
The whole reason blizzard decided to make servers with such huge populations to begin with is because they assumed (incorrectly) that a lot more people would quit after launch than they did, and they didn’t want any servers to end up with critically low populations, which would require server mergers. Instead, we’re now left with critically imbalanced servers, which is a much worse problem to have, and the only fix is... server mergers with another server that’s imbalanced in the other direction. Unfortunately, almost all servers are imbalance toward the horde, very few are alliance dominant, and it’s getting worse by the day as more alliance quit. Blizzard has screwed the pooch essentially.
---
I don’t think there’s really a good fix at this point. We shouldn’t have had layering. We shouldn’t have had such high populations. Blizzard should have called out from before launch that server mergers would be inevitable at some point, and what would be the reason for doing one so everyone would be prepared if their server ever got too imbalanced or too low in population.
---
everything. alliance might have better organized pvp with paladins (potentially), but horde leveling is far easier. horde quality of life is far better (zeps vs boats, flight paths, etc). compare kargath to any alliance town and its a joke.
---
pvp racials on horde are far better, but alliance have paladins so for organize pvp i guess its a push, but for random world pvp if you roll alliance you will need to remember UD have wotf and orcs have stun resist, so its a huge disadvantage for alliance.
---
I joined this reddit when it had about 60k subscribers. Honestly, this was the reason I created a reddit profile. There's always been a fair share of whining and general garbage, but the quality really dropped in the months approaching Classic launch and it's just been bottoming out since then. I still find this reddit slightly less toxic than the official forums, which is probably why I stick around.
---
My comment wasn't meant to break down everything you say. Just to to add my point of view.
---
Some of the responsibility is in the hands of the players, but most of the current situation is caused by bad game design. I'd strongly argue that the vast majority of the responsibility lies with Blizzard. It's hard to blame players for optimizing their play to get the best gear they can get. It's also hard to blame players that they didn't foresee just how bad things could get on PvP servers. In P1, things felt like the PvP servers of old for the most part. Suddenly, months later, this changes dramatically due to this poorly designed system. If this system was in from the start, people could accurately gauge the level of toxicity in PvP servers. But this was not the case.
---
Yes, altoholics are a thing. But usually people play alts on the same server with the same social network of friends. There are people that play on different servers, but I don't think there are very many of them. And also: altoholics do that by choice. Not because they were literally bullied out of their server, and away from the friends they made there and away from the characters they spent 200+ hours to get to where they are. That's a huge difference.
---
And of course I play games to have fun. But telling people to relax does nothing at all for them, nor does it help the discussion about the current state of the game. Playing for hours to complete one or two quests isn't fun, no matter how relaxed you are. Not being able find a group of people to run a dungeon because nobody wants to do an hour-long death run to get to the instance can't be solved by being relaxed. For many people the game is almost literally unplayable, because they cannot do the things they enjoy. But these are also people that love and deeply care about the game. At that point it goes beyond just relaxing and having fun in the moment. They want the game to go back to a state where it is playable for everyone, not just the people that picked the right faction. And yes, people will get quite militant about it.
---
For a lot of people, "relaxing and having fun", right now, means staying the F away from WoW. That's just sad.
---
There no way it's only a 3k server cap, whenever I run the census on my medium population sever I get around 1200 alliance, and the population is relatively balanced. So primetime sever population is around 2500, but still only shows medium.
---
He didn't say all, he said most.
---
Can warriors and warlocks inflict damage on themselves while frost trapped?
---
Yeah I know, people are still greatly misunderstanding layering even though it's been detailed for months and gone for weeks. I'm not sure how exactly people reached the conclusion of "yeah just before P2 there will be at least 7k concurrent on the top servers and then overnight Blizzard will just stop at least half of those people logging in". Bonkers.
---
/run SetRaidTarget("target",8)    
---
This marks your current target with a skull as part of a macro.   
---
I add/remove this from my charge as warrior for tanking since I don't enjoy pressing additional keys (got other stuff in there, dismount, change stance if out of combat,... but yeah you get the point).
---
&gt;MC/BWL can be cleared by clueless pugs that dont enchant or consume as long as you have two tanks and a handful of healers that know what they're doing.
---
No, I would never ever pug BWL. Its the most threat sensitive raid in the game probably, and one fucker in a pug trying to impress people on the DPS will just wipe the raid continiously. Its a much more difficult raid than MC/Ony.
---
Pve gear is the best pvp gear for many classes, better than blue pvp set
---
Devilsaur leather also has a limited demand, whereas lotus has a demand that grows as we get further into raid content
---
You don’t think it has anything to do with dps used to retail who go apeshit before a single sunder goes off?
---
A good tank will set expectations for dps at the start but a lot of the kiddos ignore it and just start nuking.
---
Sure, which I know is frustrating. I'm not exactly thrilled when it takes me 7+ corpse hops to get into an instance myself. It's just a few weeks. They tried to stick to the original schedule and found that the server max population bump has caused problems, so they are accelerating the schedule. I don't know what else people want.
---
I have a theory that latin american communities are more toxic because we developed an inferiority complex over the years, this created by being harassed by english speaking users. Just a theory havent reaserched nothing at all.
---
If you're looking at it from a mana cost to DPS perspective, it's not. It's better to have DoT's ticking on 3 mobs while shadowbolting 1 than it is to just be shadowbolting 1 only. 
---
The issue at hand is getting the DoT's on there before the warrior has time to get any agro.
---
&gt;I’ve thought that trash is just shadowbolt or RoF/hellfire.
---
Warlock AoE's are pretty trash compared to mages. Probably just as mana ineffecient as DoT's are on trash pulls. Hellfire is a bit of an exeption if you have a large enough pull to make it worth using the mana, your health, and the healer's mana.
---
That spec is only so-so. You're giving up 3% hit so that every now and then your feign death isn't resisted in a tribute run. If you're well geared in MC gear you might have enough to make up for the lost +hit, but you're still sacrificing 3% crit so that you can have the hit gear and improved feign.
---
Circling back again, if you do anything moving forward, just stop spreading overt misinformation. Let conversations occur without you making up weird anecdotal stories of your guild "knowing better". 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=298695/blizzard-investigating-honor-calculation-bugs?webhook
---
You definitely have better gear than I do for those 5 slots, but I don’t see how 5 pieces can double a repair cost. Since 1g for 10% durability is basically saying 10g if you were all broken.
---
Uthers, whatever the level you can use it at (47?). I bought it off the ah for 20g
---
Do you even read what I type?
---
"There's a reason why almost every raiding rogue u bother to check on ur server will be using perds."
---
Yea because they compete with warriors for swords, and perds is a rag weapon and is BiS IN THIS PHASE. Next phase, top dps rogues will be using SWORDS.  And it won't be "just a little bit" more dps. In longer fights in AQ and BWL and Naxx, swords really shines. Daggers only does well in short fights.
---
You're an alliance player right? Its a bit different over there because warriors really want the swords too. 
---
Here on horde there are too major differences. 1. Orc furies want axes. So swords are pretty open for rogues. 2. We have no salvation and we have windfury. So threat is a much larger bottleneck for us. 3. Quel serrar is not great horde side because no sword spec from humans
---
Giving a single tank daggers in preparation for the threat intensive fights in BWL is a very smart move. It greatly benefits everyone in the raid. Rogues will survive without getting prioed a single set of daggers, especially with all the swords coming in BWL.
---
You have a completely biased towards rogues mindset. And its twisted because you are alliance and threat doesnt really matter on the easy-mode faction.
---
If you don't enjoy the leveling aspect of this game even just a little bit, then Classic isn't for you. Just leave, and don't look back. You think you did, but you didn't.
---
Shadow reflector is equipped but I do not carry restorative potions. Will have to look into those.
---
Blizz needs to take a more active role in balancing this shit. Does anyone know why they don't?
---
alts dude. alts exist
---
&gt; Granted I work a lot of overtime and have a wife and kid, but still how the fuck do people have this much time. It makes no sense to me. Like what in the fucking world am I missing here.
---
If you don't have a wife and kid and work a lot of overtime you have a lot of free time. You really can't grasp that?
---
Also, you think this behaviour is unfair cause his char is too advanced compared to yours, but it will be the same at lv60, a fresh 60 can't do anything against an optimal one, so what ? Should we do DK if you kill someone with less stuff than you ?
---
It's an mmorpg with grind, through levels and stuff, if you don't like it you don't like the concept of the game
---
In the most optimal way the tank will never be hit by the knock back.  
---
You can determine who will be hit by it by comparing GUIDs.
---
Reducing population won't fix the lack of content and bordem amongst (What is now) semi-casual players. You would still have the majority of max level people, who weren't leveling an alt, hunting down players for HK.
---
&gt;We are fairly sure — we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest, and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations.  
---
&gt;That's why we're not jumping to, hey, let's just open up dozens and dozens of servers. We have the ability to do that. This isn't about limiting costs or available hardware or anything like that. We could do that easily if we wanted to, actually much more easily than having complicated tech like layering.
---
You just described a pve server player.
---
It can take multiple tries for blasting charges to work. I think it took me 4 tries the first time I went in to turn in a quest at the library.
---
Wasn't lotus removed from av in the iteration we are receiving?
---
For PVP the Shanker/Kris combo is  your best bet. For PVE it's the Shanker/Distracting. 
---
Although if you're raiding MC and your raid strategizes the debuff slots then the Shanker isn't an option due to the proc. In that case it's best to roll with Kris/Distracting.
---
But you have to kill a lot more players to grind your ranking. As soon BGs are out, all my Horde kills will earn me more than your grinding at this moment.
---
Blizzard did this. Pvp gear is god tier right now and the only way to get it is honor farming in world pvp. They literally created this problem
---
Later as in end of naxx
---
If you deal with them pretty well, they would be "living" in IF, now would they?
---
If the default UI wasn't terrible, I'd be a lot more sympathetic to this.
---
Concurrent players in classic seem to be significantly higher than 6k at least on the higher populated servers.
---
To be honest I rounded up. But if my gear was completely broken it would be around 9.5g. I repaired yesterday at 28% overall durability and it was just over 7g
---
Up to a certain point. If you're in PvP blues when AQ rolls around, you're gonna get fucking dumpstered by Timmy who's a 9 year old warrior that lost one of his hands to a tiger at the zoo when he was 4 years old. If you're ranking through AV, 12 is definitely possible solo.
---
All the YouTube guides said herbs would increase in price since pvping will make herbing a lot harder. But it didn’t.
---
Yeah, but a lot less now than if they put faction queues in.
---
Against whom? You still need an opponent for BGs.
---
&gt; I want to stress, that we do have all the kills recorded, even though you can’t see them all in-game, and we’re working hard to get the weekly statistics correct.
---
Jackass.
---
They fluctuate between 90-110g on my server(Skeram) and have been there ever since layering was removed.
---
Fuck
---
It was fun before phase 2. Now it's just...ugh. It'll probably be fine again once BGs are out (though if my assumption ends up being correct and horde has really long queues, they'll still be out in the world killing alliance while waiting).
---
I'd bet the majority of players would enjoy PvE servers more and fear of missing out fooled them into rolling PvP servers. Shit, retail is PvE by default these days so I'm probably not too far off.
---
Maybe they should have read the part where honor was phase 2 and bgs were phase 3  and used their brain.
---
IIRC the PVE:PVP server ratio was like 4:1 back in vanilla, but it seems like it completely flipped for classic. Tons of people rolling PVP servers that are probably regretting it now. I'm so glad I rolled a PVE server.
---
Just have it as a different layer of flagging just like how you can AoE around NPC's without them taking damage. If they attack you first, they are flagged and open to being killed. If they are randomly on the battlefield standing there, your AoE doesn't hit them. 
---
I think the issue is people look at these changes with how the game is currently implemented. These changes would have to come with some other tweaks to make them worthwhile and with them, it's possible to work out in a good way.
---
I've come this far down hoping someone would spell out what DK stands for, or that someone else would have asked, but alas . . .
---
What is DK?
---
This is awesome! 
---
What macros are you using?
---
He should have passed it to a human
---
For PVP the Shanker/Kris combo is your best bet.  You could also  consider farming Bonescraper rolling with the Kris/Bonescraper. The proc on the Shanker can really screw you if it happens to interupt a Gouge/Blind. It just sucks there isn't better itemization for Daggers at 60.
---
For PVE it's the Shanker/Distracting. Although if you're raiding MC/Ony and your raid prioritizes the debuff slots then the Shanker isn't an option due to the proc. In that case it's best to roll with Kris/Distracting.
---
found the rogue that sits on the menethil boat.
---
*Slightly* Alliance favoured. lmfao
---
Have your raid form and hour early in kargath and roll out together with other guilds.
---
I think it's a hat
---
No mate I meant I haven't played since launch, I started playing 1.5 weeks after launch.
---
Cut the Dots at 45%, single target. We usually have 2 tanks in the landing zone. No dps when she lands and for 10 to 15 secs. Back dat up. Done.
---
Abusive PVP is a thing? So glad I stopped playing Classic, safe spaces for PVP servers lmao, so pathetic.
---
DAE horde mean? 😂 blueberry crybaby gang 💯
---
Sure does, but that's also when it becomes a real challenge to aquire said gear. MC is pugable, AQ &amp; Naxx very much isn't.
---
I have a desire to pvp.  What's going on shouldn't be anyone's definition of pvp and if it's yours? Yikers
---
A lock and mage partner can probably make some good gold camping in searing gorge selling summons and ports back.
---
It was fine before honor came out, suggestions here and there but nobody was wailing about squat, but right now getting murdered nonstop IS the game on a lot of servers.
---
I am going to tell you now, you are RANK CAPPED by the hours you play, you have 6hrs a week then you will never get higher than rank 6 or 7, if you have maybe 20 hours a week you may get to rank 9 or 10, if you want anything beyond that you are going to be playing MINIMUM of 5 hours a day, the r14 players will spend the final two months playing upwards of 16hrs a day or they simply never get there.   
---
I am not just throwing random crap out there, I was a GM on a private realm for 6 years, have ranked to 12+ a couple times in the last decade and those private realms did NOT have 10k+ players on a single realm.
---
OP clicks their sprint and health potions btw
---
I think a better sports comparison would be boxing. The sport began as an exciting spectator sport but as the meta evolved boxers like Floyd mayweather figured out how to use the rules to their advantage. Watching a fighter run away and avoid confrontation only throwing punches to score points does not make an interesting event compared to brawling for KO's. The rules need to be adjusted you can't blame the participants.
---
Its all about getting a feel for the people in the group as you go. Dungeons are long, if the hunter pet is pulling things early, best to clear extra instead of expecting him to be able to sneak past the tight spot later. If the rogue is super geared and is opening every fight with max dps, cool, Ill throw a sunder for initial agro then he gets to tank the skull, I'll tank the other 2-3 mobs in the pack.
---
Hasn't layering been removed with Phase 2?
---
This is very useful, thank you
---
I think he was making a joke that you took a bit too literal. /u/IamWaffles could you clarify?
---
Your attempt at a straw man maneuver failed long ago. Stop shilling Blizzard.
---
Lol I tried that when I accidently didn't get mark of tyranny super triggering to hear that they basically told me "Sucks to be you make a new druid if you want the right quest reward"
---
First month of classic WOW was so great, but more and more I feel like I'm sharing the experience with an increasing number of dicks. OP's profile  is waaaaay fucking cringe.
---
A lot of problems also come from those fury/arms warriors who just throw on some plate and go to tank dungeons, but they haven't learned any tank conventions/habits while leveling and so tend to make more mistakes on pull timing or difficult pulls. It's definitely a learned skill. The obvious one that comes to mind is the pull in UBRS right in the middle of the room before Beast. There's a dragon and 3 humanoids, and you can pull it as 2 and then the 3 humanoids if you grab the pat while he's close to the dragon. It lets you control the pull better, and saves mana for the healer by pulling smaller groups and just chain pulling, yet I've never once seen another tank do it this way. This is just an "obvious" example, but almost every dungeon has pulls that can be treated this way if your tank is actually used to tanking. 
---
Gear also plays a role in how/when you pull. I'll regularly pull when healers are 20% mana just because I take almost no damage. Any time I run with pugs (which is admittedly almost never anymore) after first or second pull I always get a comment from the healer that "wow, this tank isn't taking any damage". As someone who ALWAYS wears tank gear, I know how much damage I take, I know how difficult it is to heal me, and I'm able to plan accordingly while taking my healer's mana into account.
---
This game would be so much better if there were no factions, it was just FFA.. Everyone for themselves. Its basically what made me go back to retail. Fuck my team. All they wanna do is sit in Ironforge and use wow as a chat room, then complain that they cant do anything.. Ok, then.. So all of us in Ironforge.. All 500 of us just standing here... Lets go fucking clear out the enemy horde. It'll be fun.... "Nah.. Thats too much work.."... Ok?
---
if you put a dot on yourself beforehand, yes. But you can not use any abilities while trapped, so no.
---
Here's the thing.   
---
Northdale, a private server had buttery smooth World PVP at 17k plus players and I've seen battles with over five hundred people with lagless gameplay.  
---
Think about that for a second...I can't currently get more than a hundred players in BRM before there is literally a 5-second delay on abilities.  
---
Northdale didn't need layers, they just implemented dynamic respawns less stupidly.
---
Ah yes, giving players items for free without having to work for them. I do love retail. Oh wait...
---
Gotta get dem double freezing bands though. Your neckbeard is not thick enough. Incredibly useful if you're getting piled by melee and have some heals on you.
---
\&gt;  that will be replaced later 
---
From the last boss of the game in like 1.5-2 years :D
---
Brut blade should always be prioritized to rogues and non-orc wars. Who knows though, maybe he got it in a pug
---
Man that friend quit on you like 2 months ago leaving you stranded.
---
Blizzard made a change where addons cannot call /who automatically. So they updated their code to call a new /who command whenever the user does something like click their mouse or rotate the screen. So it works essentially the same as it did before.
---
I bought mine for 195. over a month ago, and even now that it's becoming more common I think I got a decent price. 
---
Our other guild smith paid 200g for his, and most people I talked to paid anywhere from 200-250. I've only ever seen one go for cheaper than the 195 I got mine for.
---
Alright, if that's the case maybe just grinding mobs won't be worth. Doing all the quests and then go back to dungeons I guess.
---
This still happens for players who are on the dominant faction. My server is horde dominated yet I can’t peacefully quest anywhere because there’s a gnome every 15ft waiting for me to appear.
---
Star often used for shackle on undead.
---
But yes these seem to be the universal markings.
---
Fair. Edited to low chance of death.
---
&gt;For now nobody uses Flask in MC
---
Someone please tell my guild this. They keep expecting people to flask, and im like nah.

It looks to be stable around 6k, there are some higher peaks but in keep in mind that it was during layering.
---
One thing I'd suggest testing is if force of will and blessing of sanctuary stack. From my testing atleast on low level mobs (stockades elites), they do not. I haven't tried higher level mobs.
---
I'm 45 now. I should just get as much questing in until magical number 48 then run ZF over and over? Or Mara at that point? And BRD early parts at 52?
---
Can u do this at lower levels like 40 if ur just doing chests?
---
A majority of bored 60s on a 3k pop is a fraction of a majority of bored 60s with a 30k pop.
---
It would be silly. But at least on atlas loot it's showing me they come out P6 rather than the 2.5. If that turns out to be wrong then the grind begins!
---
Remember when the mods had a day where they allowed "Low Effort Memes" and then made that day last indefinitely?
---
Remember when this sub started (right around Classic's announcement) and had a ton of useful information and even discourse about the upcoming game?
---
The mods saw the numbers on the r/wow sub and made it their goal, completely tanking the community of this sub in the process.
---
It's almost at r/wow levels atm. Only this is even more complains and  bad memes. r/wow at least has a lot of art stuff going on ( made by my wife btw, show her support xoxo).
---
Probs just too much work and they might say people would complain regardless. I'd be down for paid transfer to pve or a fresh server. The only servers I can go to are either dead or have the exact same ratio.
---
Honestly love the pvp. I get to stealth around and gank. Also I had the big lake in EPL all to myself for about an hour. Got a bunch of water essence.
---
So as an alliance on any server?
---
Nope because I main a tank and when I’m playing an alt it’s brutally obvious how poorly most tanks play, yet they always blame everybody else.
---
People that do are busy playing.  People that don't are busy crying about a game they barely play anyways.
---
I know, like just what's the world coming to?
---
The whole deal with this trick imo is that it won't matter either way. Sure, you get a little victory by not giving honor but when it comes down to it it'll barely take an oz. of extra work to get the kill on their end so they virtually don't lose anything. Whenever one person shoots the first shot, everyone will just dogpile and kill the guy regardless. That's just how it goes.
---
1. I think it's 100% with 315. Our MT goes in there with like 305, and the last two kills he's never gotten knocked back. 
---
2. Yes, it's possible, you should be able to do this about 50-75% of the time fairly easily. I think our MT has only missed it once, although like I said it's been quite a while since he's actually had to do it. The main thing is to already be ready in Berserker Stance - if you have to stance dance, you probably won't make it, because you do get knocked back pretty fast.
---
If you think you're going to explain to a virgin how his perceived ingame triumphs are going to hurt the longevity of his server, think again.
---
This is the culture now.
---
Your Counter Strike example is quite possibly the worst example you could have come up with to defend this. Counter Strike is inherently a balanced test of skill, if you're repeatedly being killed it is up to you to improve and beat the other person. Current Classic WoW is the exact opposite of that, you cannot improve to defeat the enemies who are ganking you in a massive raid, you either have access to a bigger raid than them or you die repeatedly, and the sad reality of the situation is that most people don't have that access, specially the minority faction.
---
But regardless even in Counter Strike, if you're a pro playing against a first time player, it would be very easy to describe headshotting him across the map in the first 3 seconds to the point he quits as immoral behaviour.
---
The game also never used to be like this, you can't have played in 2005 if you're saying that. There occasionally were people camping FPs but they were few and far in between, so it was realistic to plan to bring guildies together to kill them. It wasn't a constant train of people from the FP all the way up to MC entrance and then outside BRD entrance.
---
You can do this if you like since Blizzard allows you to. But you cannot ethically justify it, it shits on the experience of others for your own, frankly insignificant gain. Saying people can git gud is merely a poor excuse.
---
Yep, idk how many times this needs to be said but they seriously underestimated how popular Classic would be. I would have loved to be in the command room at Blizzard when Classic launched and they saw exactly how many people were logging on and staying on for the coming weeks just to see the looks on the execs faces.
---
The idea of sometimes being the hammer and sometimes being the nail is fun. You don’t need to be sociopathic to have fun with that in a VIDEO GAME. 
---
I camp some horde for awhile, then they write down my name, @ me in the server discord with some shit talk, then organize a group to camp me in the future. We go back and forth with hits on each other. 
---
This whole process is a lot of fun, and the only reason people get emotionally invested is because there are opposing people working to take away significant portions of your free time . Without that there are no stakes. 
---
In real life the only real acceptable way to engage in fun conflict like this is with sports shit talk, but that becomes less prevalent as you get older. 
---
Just killing someone in game and feeling more powerful isn’t sociopathic either. Lots of people find getting super fed and one shotting enemies in league of legends fun too. 
---
If you don’t want to play within this system, then work around it somehow either by making large moving groups or rerolling, but don’t mislabel the people who enjoy it as sociopaths.
---
I remember that the quest XP from AV was %XP from actual Level, so wait Till lev 59 before you turn in the most of the for Max quest XP.
---
BGs I think will solve a lot of the problems. People like that you can actually kill people and it's a lot simpler also and will love BGs. Retail BGs are gruesome.
---
When you have fewer numbers, the only way to win is organizing better.
---
I threw one together real quick

---
Let me know if there are issues, you should be able to figure out how to add more.
---
You think you do want WPVP but you don't.
---
Who cares what your definition of PvP is? This is what's happening, regardless of what you call it. It was expected, and if you don't want it, reroll or quit.
---
"layering removed" means each server has effectively 1 "layer" now.
---
yeah just like when honor was first introduced in vanilla and just like when pservers do slow patch rollouts. its the same every friggin time and everytime when BGs are released wpvp completely dies down. its one more fuckin week guys just shutup until at least then.
---
"You have a 60 horde spriest on Herod. I don't think you've truly experienced the pain of spending 30-45 min just to get into DM."
---
I'm confused... It's exactly the opposite, I could wait 2 hours and no luck. Not a single group unless I found a group that 1) needed heals and 2) accepted a spriest as heal. That's barely doable (almost impossible), AND I don't want to be a healer. The last 3 times I actually logged in I looked for a group for over an hour and left. I haven't played since then, and never launched it since honor. I don't want to start over because people are elitists.
---
Also, 65/35? Has the balance shifted this much since honor? That sucks, sorry for you guys. My levelling experience was extremely painful since, even though I like PvP, I don't like to be a complete asshole, but it seems that's what "pvp" means for most people.
---
Raid log and play twinks.
---
Did you use ravager all the way to 52?
---
Didn't all the BR players roll on Thalnos?
---
Dude this happens on every server. There can be 300 people sitting in front of bank and rogues/mages will suicide for kills.
---
Already quit I thought that was pretty clear but ok
---
You are greatly exaggerating just how often Horde wins WSG/AB. Alliance will still have very quick queues compared to Horde. 
---
Also, I would like to know where you read that they would only link PvP servers together. AFAIK, PvE realms are majority Alliance and the total Classic population is very nearly 50-50.
---
This is fun? https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4lgeu/honestly_how_can_anyone_say_this_is_okay/?st=k3onr5xh&amp;sh=851f1b41
---
If you think that's how it should be, you're a sociopath.
---
Did you miss the layering drama? The stream man bad drama? Beta access drama? Faction imbalance? Server population? Queues? This subreddit is toxic garbage.
---
Most tanks actually like 2htanking the mid point of the dungeon since it's mostly an AOE fiesta
---
Warlocks and mages both can make great use of the escape artist as well.
---
Yes, but at that point you're probably better off killing dustdevils in westfall (if you're alliance)
---
I like to put up afk tag and hope one of the rogues tries to kill me.
---
Well at least im not the type of guy that acts like an idiot while shouting "look at me im funny". Its okay if u prefer being such type but please.. at least leave me alone with that bullshit
---
I’ve set up a macro, telling everyone in the party what my marks mean. For me, it’s the tanks duty to put up marks, if he knows the dungeon. Never be a lazy tank :)
---
My order is Skull 1, X is 2, moon =Sheep, blue =trap, star =shackle, green =sap, purple= fear.
---
I played on private servers for three or so years before classic was released. Played right up to release day. The main pserver I played sort of rhymes with "bonus pun". I raided right up until naxx.
---
The biggest and rudest awakening I can see coming up is for horde on the PvP servers when it comes to BG queues. This happened on all of the servers I've played on. One side gets imbalanced, and then has 40+ minute queues.
---
A common "refutement" that you'll hear from people is "but they've confirmed battlegroups" - But it doesn't matter. It's not amount of people that matters- It's percentages. If all the servers in your battlegroup are H-A 60-40, then there will be more games taking place, but once all the active games are filled, the queueing begins. 
---
More games playing does mean more games ending, so perhaps 45 minutes is a bit much of an estimate- I'm not certain. But I foresee (quote this post if you want) a large mass of posts incoming complaining about the queue times from the horde of PvP servers.
---
P2 was the alliance complaining- Now P2.5 will be the horde complaining.
---
I saw a reply from another pserver player here and I completely agree with his sentinent. The very best time for a server (and even the best time to start playing imo) is just after ZG release.
---
ZG is a catch-up raid. Many people will quit once BWL is on farm because of boredom, and so raiders will be looking to pad out their rosters with new people, and their core will already be geared. 
---
I am really looking forward to the "chill" atmosphere of a post-ZG server.
---
Oh and another (very obvious) complaint incoming is the number of players making premade groups for BGs, but that doesn't take previous experience to see.
---
It's actually the level you get it divided by 20 as the additional coefficient.  So if you get it at level 12.. it's 12/20 for .6 or 60% effectiveness.  This is then multiplied by the standard spell cast time coefficient.
---
Flasks are pretty important for progression later on.
---
Hmmm, I wonder WHY they're not aggroing the guards! /s
---
I've only ever corpse camped as retribution for being griefed, and even then only a handful of times. Have I occasionally ended a lowbie? Sure, sometimes you just get a perverse notion to pop someone, or you're having a bad day, who knows. That said it's far from the norm for me. Most of the time if people are out in the world leveling or working on something I let them be, I'll level next to the other faction no problem. In the end we're both struggling down the path to 60. At 60 I find it to be far more fun to fight other 60s in even battles, not gank squads. I don't understand people who can do this sort of thing all day and gain pleasure from it. The occasional dick move is one thing, camping someone 40 levels lower than you, I don't get it. #notallhorde
---
Many players are hoarding lotuses, on my server they went from like 110g when the layers dropped, down to 80g. Look at the pattern that happened with dire maul release and p2 release, items saw a steep increase in price with the announcement. Then with the release of the phase all the item prices crashed.
---
Great video!  Hunter pvp is the best if done correctly.  
---
Random UI question....I have had a bitch of a time getting my aimed shot cast bar to work correctly.  Did you have to turn off the blizzard default cast bar?  Or did you have to set up Quartz a specific way?
---
So when Alzzin's at \~50% HP and the imps come out the cave entrance is open- if your main goal is to down Alzzin to get those sweet sweet Thorium nodes (and you have a SS active), you can stand on the ledge waiting for all the mobs to get to you then just start running up the tunnel, you should be able to run up into the tunnel and by the time you die from the mobs running back down the ledge up to you you should be far enough away that they won't aggro when you self-rezz. It's a messy ordeal and requires you have a SS + no loot from Alzzin, but if you're going to wipe anyways (and frankly the imps on top of fel lasher aggro really makes it tough unless you're specced specifically for DM E farming) it's IMO the best of the situation you can do.
---
I switch to a Skull of Impending Doom to get a little extra speed boost to get up the tunnel, but it's not a requirement.
---
The ingame community is fantastic, but if you read reddit it would seem like its all toxic douchebags.
---
What's the significance of these?
---
You can easily cancel heroic strike or let it go through. You get to apply skull and then decide what’s appropriate without wasting another hot key.
---
I don't understand why they can't do this now.  Drastically lower the server pop caps and enforce faction queues while simultaneously offering free faction changes and server transfers where applicable.  You'd get mass migrations and entire guilds switching factions and it would fairly quickly level out.
---
Well... It is quite funny to see. I have a powerful imagination, so I can picture the tilt. I think most people agree that if the victim is just sad or indifferent, it's time to stop ganking. If he gets mad and whispers insults back... Oh boy, there we go.
---
It wasn't as serious of a comment as some people are taking it. Yikes, I stepped on some retail toes in classic sub.
---
pretty much.
---
or, at best, the good player already have their guild/cliques and aren't pugging.
---
or in other word: you're behind the curve now.
---
But...but...there goes abilities :)
---
I am glad they didn't, and if people want to play on 3k ghosttowns, they can just switch to dead-pop servers.
---
Then everyone gets what they want.
---
not nearly as much as you think, especially now that there's something to do after the weekly raid clear.
---
No it's not. Sure, a /who is less robust than "there are X accounts with 60s in server Y" from Blizzard. But this data uses a relatively solid collection method spread across many players.
---
we had \~200-300 players fighting over Kazzak yesterday on Rattlegore and there was zero lag.  Not sure why you are seeing lag at \~100
---
Easy to justify the decision to the group by explaining its more potential loot, even a trash pack of 5 mobs is worth 50s to each player on average when you consider coin and cloth and other random drops.  Hell you could miss a potential world drop epic.  I get so annoyed with tanks trying to skip 2 or 3 mobs because they want to save what, 30 seconds?  Even if they skip 4 packs in a full run, they made up a whole 2 minutes.
---
Well you missunderstand something here, Blizzard should merge servers only and only if their prediction is true that people will leave after few weeks. Nobody says they should merge servers at all costs.
---
You can not avoid merging layers (everyone hats layers right?) but you can avoid merging servers (if the population is just right).
---
/u/HolypenguinHere said:
---
&gt;The key difference being that battlegrounds contained a huge portion of the honor farming back in Vanilla, which we haven't had for the last few weeks.
---
Then you replied:
---
&gt;This is it.
---
Yes. Honestly i don't blame the players, i blame Blizz for not launching it day 1.
---
Rules and systems shape how humans behave at a population scale in real life too.
---
SL gives you the strongest pets and gives you talents which tie your damage and survivability to your pet, plus gives you a .5sec summon every 15m. 
---
Either Nightfall/SL (little better at Solo PvE w/ Fel Conc, Amp Curse, Nightfall) or SL/Shadowburn (little better at group PvE w/ Imp SB, Bane, Shadowburn to execute fleeing mobs) will give you the 31 demonology talents you need for the best pets.
---
Hunters were in world first naxx clears...

---
Hi all, I'm looking to upgrade my computer these holidays and need some advice/direction. 
---
I have a 2013 MacBook pro (6 years old, still works fine) but I'm ready to upgrade. The only gaming Ill do on it will be WoW, and I want to be able to have the graphics turned all the way up while maintaining 60-100 fps. I haven't decided between a desktop and a laptop as of yet, but operating system can be either windows or Mac, I’ll just install boot camp either way. I don’t have a price limit/budget yet, but let’s keep it reasonable :) 
---
I’m looking for something that will run WoW flawlessly, but not overkill it on the specs required. In all honesty I’m not well versed in things like ram, processing, etc. any and all recommendations welcome!
---
The ONLY evidence anyone has provided is ironforge.pro which is a less robust collection method than /who being run across the day.
---
Climate change is real btw jabroni.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18082
---
please keep showing how ignorant you are, I love it
---
My anecdotal understanding is that a lot of would-be pvpers just say 'screw it' and look for another target if they see a soul-link warlock.  Running VW as soul link is also viable as you get a sac shield and then an immediate resummon for another sac shield if needed.
---
Woah this would make me feel better haha. A small personal victory. I have not grieved about the ganking once yet until last night when I had 45 minutes to play after a long rough day at work. Tried three different zones and upon landing was greeted by full raid groups and a dead flight master lol. Multiple deaths at each attempts and ended up running out of time. I actually enjoy the world pvp bloodbath, but I also usually have more time to play.
---
U know who else have bag space problems? Us warriors, i have to keep a set of tanking gears with me at all times.
---
Yeah, also edited, I play 4 days a week not 3. Anyways, it's not as if I want to do anything else regardless if I'm capped or not.
---
Honestly man, this really is what the classic experience is. It took me a little while to understand that. I was heated because of how difficult,  or impossible, it was to do anything in the open world.   
---
After a week of hating everything, I eventually I just had to accept that this was how the game was going to be played.
---
Basically, my point to you is that if you're not okay with getting killed in the wild you probably won't enjoy the game anymore at this point.
---
By same battlegrounds do you mean same battle groups? I've been looking for a source for this but haven't found anything.
---
It's nothing to me, I was just explaining why people are probably downvoting you. However multi-boxing absolutely impacts more people than just the multi-boxer, as in the OP, where he's engaging in PvP, instantly defeating solo players. I'd say that's probably more toxic than people who find playing MMOs strictly solo perplexing.
---
Because when Honor System hit, you didn't have this many people at 60, in optimized gear, with epic mounts, knowing how to maximize Honor.  By the time it reached high levels, BGs were out.
---
So the current situation never existed.  That was the point, idjit.
---
the +12 Int wasn't a giveaway?
---
&gt;t city to sie
---
krom krush -was- like 54/46 in favor of horde like 3 weeks in.  
---
i bet now it's more like 70/30, if not more.  while i was leveling originally i was ahead of the curve (took a week vacation at launch), and every single zone i went through was a struggle; really felt like alliance outnumbered horde in general, or that they were just faster with leveling.  idk what happened, it almost seems like all the ally players got to the cap and immediately quit or something.
---
&gt;Classic mad difficult mechanically.
---
He said while braggin about killing lowbies lmao
---
get fucked loser
---
Interesting. It would be closer to 20g on my server and I'm on a medium-high pop. Small rads are 3-4g usually.
---
Yep this post is true. Also you can reset more than once and get people stuck in different instances of the zone so be careful.
---
On what server? On Mograine alliance the price is the same for a month and a half (75g+-10%).
---
Yes, I dont expect them to be wholly accurate. But the collection method is pretty sound, much better than "upload your raid logs".
---
This is exactly what the wow forums were back in vanilla just a bunch of non stop whining and complaining.
---
The attention to detail and level of animation skill is very impressive compared to 99% of other Machinimas.
---
Then again I haven't watched a WoW machinima since WoTLK so my opinion is out of date.
---
So much salt, so much cry. One day maybe you’ll get gud
---
Large pop also makes alting into a much better experience.
---
&gt;PVP servers do not function well because ganking inhibits world content from being done whether that is leveling or material farming and makes instanced content take a very long time to get into the entrance.
---
Nope, private servers had up 3k large pop than the current cap, and they worked completly fine.
---
They changed devilsaur rates right? I can see them changing this if lotuses start to cost 1k each.
---
Most fight in MC from a warlock perspective are mostly tank n' spank with maybe a "move out of the fire" mechanic. 
---
The Warlock specific job you'll have to do will be Banishing dangerous add in pulls. The Lava Elemental has an AoE stun that does massive damage, if you want to be extra careful, bring a Free action potion so you cannot be stunned during the banish.
---
The way I do personally (Sm/Ruin) is I send the voidwalker in and when he taunts and get aggro, he will swing the elemental facing away from the raid, then I banish it. During the 0.1 sec between rebanish (get a debuff timer addon), if he decides to AoE stun, only the voidwalker will get hit.
---
For Garr, you'll be assigned a banish target, DPSing is a secondary job on that fight, make sure that add stays banished until a tank calls he has it.
---
If you are playing a spec with a pet, use the Felhunter on Geddon so you can instant dispel yourself mana ignite, you'll save massive amount of mana.
---
On Ragnaros, don't stack or other or at the very most, 1 other person if using the buddy system, if you have a second phase (lower DPS group), the banish one of the Sons of Fire when they come, ask Raid lead if he wants to keep it banished or killed before Rag comes back.
---
This is pathetic.  It’s a game.  Your enjoyment is dependent on your attitude, which seems to suck based on the saltiness of your post.
---
If you don't have good gear, you're going to get wrecked in BGs because 90% of the players are going to be pre raid-BIS+. Spamming dungeons will have a much better outcome as you will be leveling fast and also when you hit 60 you should have quite a few pieces of your pre-raid. If you play alot, it will only take a few days of dungeoning to get from 55 -60
---
I wouldn't know, I'm on an Alliance dominated server.
---
I had a mage take the healing staff from emperor to be petty(needed on it and left immediately) that he hadn't won a freezing band that dropped before he had even entered the instance.
---
Thing is I already had it and the person needing was a shadow priest for offspecc.
---
So yeah, definitely worth not risking it with PUGs when people can "punish" you for something you didn't even do.
---
This sub is still fun, just for different reasons now. It was fun in a more wholesome way in the beginning, now it's fun cause it's flooded with tears.
---
I don't remember the name of the server, but I played on whatever realm had &lt;Disaster&gt; and &lt;Forest Crow&gt;.
---
I quit shortly after they opened paid transfers because a lot of people in my guild left the server.
---
'' i just need a renew every other mob otherwise I'm good!''
---
proceed to link overall healing taken and the lock is above the tank...
---
yeah sure.  just a renew.
---
Flask or use consumables???  They may be saying flask but really mean elixirs.
---
Seems like your Northdale server cared for its customer base?
---
Blizzard made the choice to not reimplement the Vanilla system, but instead use the modern system and try and mold it into something that looks like the vanilla system, so there is going to be stuff we can't do that we could in Vanilla and stuff we can do that we couldn't. And as the GMs like to say, choices in Classic matter.
---
&gt;but I don't think you proved him wrong either
---
The most important thing here is the 'maximum'.  The averages will come to overtime, but the maximum will never budge.  With a small number of casts like 300, the maximum is far more important than the average.  The fact that he didn't go over the theoretical maximum in 300 casts with such a steep coefficient is pretty much proof positive that of wrath items are behaving the same as spell power items.
---
I actually saw T3 hunters with Thunderfury tank in Alterac on a certain Pserver, whereas Ferals with decent gear got flattened by Vandar. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.
---
Assuming Blizzard hasn't messed with spawn times then on full servers the demand *will* exceed the supply eventually.
---
You wouldn't. At most it's 4 sets.
---
Oh, I dont doubt that this is the fallout from releasing WPVP and not BGs. But we knew the release schedule and we knew that the servers we rolled on were PVP. Alliance seems to act like this came out of nowhere
---
Got a discount on my epic mount.
---
Especially Horde 😛
---
Can consent I am an adult. It’s called a joke. My mines are full tho so we can stop now!
---
I've never had honor spy, but I assume all those api calls on everyone else could be slowing it down for me as well.  Is this a problem across all servers or only Kromcrush?
---
eyyy, my man!
---
You might not be able to as she moves around. Although you might be right. We concluded this early in classic when she was fireballing people low on the threat meters (or the same people multiple times) but there was a bug early on with her fireballing people based on their GUID instead of the actual meters, which we didn't know about at the time which lead to us concluding it was a range thing.
---
This. This is why tanking is stressful, it’s hard to please everybody.
---
They drop magic dust, sleeps your target. Basically a reset in PvP. They cost 4g on my realm and I was able to consistently farm 5-7 per hour without mount.
---
Mind who you are replying to. I am not /u/bogusadult, whose comment you originally replied to.

Haha. I had to look up this reference. Wasn't disappointed.

I flew into Thalanaar in Feralas and was killed by 3 horde at the flight path. I was then killed a 2nd time by them as I was trying to rez+mount+run toward dire maul. The third time I got mounted and away from them a bit. They followed me literally from the thalanaar flight path all the way deep into the hall in dire maul (like 3-5mins of running) to kill me for 25% honor (3rd kill). Yeah im sure they are trying to maximize honor!
---
There weren't even ques last night as far as I know, it's been way busier before last night.  I could see this honorspy addon causing problems but I'm not sure if its just Kromcrush or if any other servers are having trouble.
---
Time is money friend
---
Ok thx bye
---
Wait.... I see what looks like mana potions and drinking water on your bars with a Kodo. Did you're raid give the bindings to a Tauren Hunter?
---
It's a multiplayer game, you play with other people, ethics absolutely comes into play when dealing with other people in a massive multiplayer environment. You are free to sod off and slaughter townfolk in Skyrim, not read a book, or not go for a walk, sorry I don't know what sad trolls do when they aren't being twats to others online.
---
On the other hand, in football (European football) some amount of being an asshole is tolerated. Think stuff like stalling or deliberately committing a foul to prevent a dangerous situation from developing. Both are unethical, are against the rules but everybody is doing it so it's mostly accepted.
---
IMO that's the complicated thing in game ethics: how much of an asshole can one be while still being acceptable in the community.
---
ive really slacked  on gold making, im level 55 with 60 gold. Plus im playing priest, time to learn princess solo farm i guess
---
Start preparing yourself and other players of your guild for future content. Just to name a few: Consumables, Crafting Material, Resistance Gear,...
---
I'm personally enjoying getting repeatedly murdered by a mage in Gadget at the forge, with no guards close enough to aggro
---
Using 3 piece Black Dragonscale (shoulders, boots, chest) instead of the normal fury gear (truestrike, bloodmail, SGC) is an approximate 1% DPS loss, in exchange for a decent amount of mitigation and FR, as well as the ability to just buy the set versus farming the dungeons.
---
It all comes down to if pve and pvp servers are lumped together in the same battle group which to my knowledge is not confirmed or denied anywhere yet. They were not combined in vanilla but as we all know that doesnt mean anything for classic so who knows?
---
My reasoning isn't based on the "It's blizzard therefore any critics are wrong", it's just simple understanding from a statement combined with my experiences me in software development (although fairly minor at the moment) tells me what you said is potentially wrong and biased by your blind hate towards anything.
---
Honorspy isn't infallible as other players have also noticed innacuracies on it for different reasons.
---
It is entirely possible what you say is true but the current information we have makes it unlikely at the moment.
---
But as I said, since I'm fueled by hate like you I lack the basic understanding of life and clairvoyance to know things that haven't been announced or talked about. Sorry for that.
---
Lol at you trying to use Kantian Philosophy to reason with insane twitch kids who chain gank lowbies. they dont give a shit about the health of the game or being decent people they gave up on that shit long ago.
---
&gt;imagine beong a rogue and farming people for 18 hours a day for 2-3 months for gear thats only marginally better untill AQ 40 comes out
---
Imagine doing that and not even cracking rank 11 because you have to compete with all the people account sharing so they can farm 22 hours a day and/or setting up kill trading schemes with high ranking members of the other faction... 
---
The honor system in Vanilla WoW was fucking garbage and it promotes play styles that are toxic and unhealthy. Its killing the game by making the world an unplayable warzone and also promoting players to be at their keyboards for 18+ hours a day. Now that we're seeing this system in the hands of a community who understands how it works - those problems are plainly visible for all to see.
---
Theyre all undead so lets go with "living" ;)
---
I regret leaving the one I started on. I wouldn't have to deal with this shit, and I'd probably have a lvl 60 by now.
---
No, it's not. Trying to shut down an argument by calling it stupid is not helpful at all.
---
In fact, your reply even says, and I'll quote:
---
&gt;investing and growing your character(s)
---
So yeah, you seem to agree that making an alt character is viable, no? So what's wrong with suggesting people do that on a PVE server?
---
yea its between 70/30 and 60/40 now according to the more recent data and that feels right
---
and yea the initial levelers were mostly ali, but those right behind you were mostly horde (i was in this group) and then it swapped back again with those behind me. i think what happened is those who did not level as fast took the xfers along with others when they were first offered because it felt really bad for them at that point and then it just snowballed from there
---
I know they have already offered free server transfers, something the latter half of my comment addresses explicitly...
---
Flasks are near useless on hunters. HP flask on the class that takes the least damage. I mean a lot will use them still prolly, but its not nearly as important as other classes.
---
AQ has a few bosses that will def req all you have to bring to beat the enrage timer. 
---
This is were the kids stay farming BWL and MC/ZG and the raiders kill C’Thun. 
---
My one at level kill on C’Thun was 3 weeks before BC. It took every consumable and buff we could get to kill that sob and it was worth it. 
---
And while the power scale has been adjusted to the player side, I still thing this boss will last over 1 reset before it dies (7-10 days). 
---
It just takes that one bad pull to cost you having to clear trash again or that one guy out of position to kill 3-4 people from the chain lightning.
---
So you've seen two Rich Thorium veins at the same time on the minimap?
---
I'm pretty sure the RTV on the volcano in the middle shares the same spawn nodes as the RTV in the SW of the area.
---
Yeah I think after you hit a node, another one will be selected within its sector at random. There was talk of there being a 7min cooldown but I don't think that's the case.
---
Does it make you feel better about yourself if you imagine people you reply to are salty and crying? Lol actually pathetic. Now go back to your care bear pve server and /wave at the opposition faction since you're too big of a baby to flag for pvp
---
Or just.... Don't be flagged? They can't kill you in your own city of you aren't flagged.
---
&gt;Drastically lower the server pop cap
---
Why don't you just move to a low pop realm?
---
Blizzard added plenty of them early on, so why didn't you just make the switch then?
---
Dude I swap my gear all the time. If I didn't carry around my tank, dps, and pvp set. I would have to be going to the bank all the time.
---
I think it's a mindset for the faction. I don't know how accurate it is, but for a faction of bloodthirsty warmongering monsters, the players certainly fit.
---
The max concurrent online cap of this "cluster" doesn't exceed 6-7k though. 
---
It's still more than 3.5k of vanilla, but nothing special since it's filled for several realms only.
---
I regret not having your foresight
---
IMO You can tank all dungeons with a 2 hander (with exception of post-Rend UBRS and a few hard hitting bosses), but it also helps if you have a decently geared healer who wont go OOM every pull.
---
Id say you’re wrong
---
When I tank, I'm definitely more of a "pull a lil extra" guy than trying to hug every wall possible just to skip a few packs. Sure, it won't be faster than a speed run but will definitely be faster than a corpse run.
---

Yes but those node timers are assigned to specific sectors of resources within a map.

I mean, for this quest specifically, literally even the stupidest Hunter in the world wouldn't pick a tanking item. The neck has a ton of agi and + hit. It's not even a choice.
---
If ur able to coordinate and get through p2 then u need to talk to ur dps, there is no reason 28 competant players should have trouble killing rag in 1 phase, 3 minutes is a really long time if ur dps just play right
---
It’s essentially useless at high levels outside of screwing rogues over. Save yourself rage for another mortal strike/bloodthirst/shield slam or something useful.
---
I'll bite. I clicked on PVP realm. I've always played on PVP realms, why the fuck not? I love an impromptu throw-down on the way to my quest or a town. I love large open world PVP battles and all.
---
This shit is ridiculous though. This is not PVP, it's just garbage game mechanics. Let's walk through some "PVP happened" from yesterday...
---
* Iron Forge is under attack constantly. There are permanently horde stationed inside the city walls.
---
* I left Iron Forge to get to the boat. Oh, the flight master and boat are camped at menethil. Die and miss the boat a few times.
---
* Get to Dustwallow Marsh via boat. Oh, the boat is being camped here. Do a couple of corpse runs to make it to the flight master. 
---
* Head to Gadgetzan. Oh, the town is littered with corpses. There are 15 horde in the town just killing anything and everyone. Do a few corpse runs trying to leave the town and get to the flight master. You can't quest there.
---
* Okay, I got to the flight master. I'm going to Feralas to try and do \*some\* kind of questing. Oh, there are horde all over the shore. They chase you down and kill you. Do a couple of long corpse runs to get back to your body so you can try to get some quests done.
---
* Okay, the horde are killing you too much. Better hearth and go to EK to do some quests. Hearth is Iron Forge. Luckily I can move through the city without being killed. Get to the flight master and go to blasted lands.
---
* The horde have killed all the NPC's in this town. Step out of the town and there are multiple horde ready to chase you down and kill you. Do a few corpse runs but you do get to kill a few mobs this time. Give up and get back to the flight path. Go to searing gorge.
---
* Oh, here at searing gorge, the horde are killing you as soon as you land. They are also preventing you from using the FP. 
---
* Finally get to fly out of Searing Gorge, head to Hinterlands. Oh, wait. The horde are chasing me down and killing me there too.
---
* Log off for the afternoon. It's been two hours and you have killed like 5 mobs. Maybe you can quest at midnight.
---
This is just endless fucking griefing without even the slightest chance of being able to play the game. Sure, I wanted to PVP, but that is being force fed back to me like a big pile of shit and people are just like "What?? You wanted this!". There aren't even enough 50's online to produce a healthy number of dungeon groups, there are only a few going at any given moment. There's no avoiding this insanity, other than just collecting some rested XP and hopping on at really crazy hours. PVP has never made the game almost nearly unplayable. Sure, it's fun to fuck with people for a little while, but the whole entire game world seems to be camped by horde just waiting for an alliance to come around.
---
Yes but the difference is that you can just turn it off and still play the game.
---
Yes, of course, this is why I say it doesn't matter in the end since Blizzard prediction was true.
---
But it's bis trinket forever as druid =/ almost worth completely relevelling
---
If the swords don't cross then it's not gay.
---
No, because they Rule 7 TONS of posts each day.
---
As a classic-only player, I am looking for a general wpvp guide for Shaman.  I'm terrible and PvP and often die in the open-world while questing even if it's just a 1v1.  I'm just looking to properly defend myself when I get ganked during questing.
---
Is there such a guide out there?  I am a level 60 shaman with all abilities learned, just really need to know exactly what to do.  To give some examples, I have learned a few tips from just being in random questing groups:
---
* Open with Flame Shock on rogues to prevent stealth
---
* Lay down earthbind totem against melee classes to kite back
---
* Use grounding totem against casters
---
\^\^\^\^\^ Things like that \^\^\^\^\^
---
But remember not to flame your teammates. I get it if the DPS will *not* stop pulling. But the DPS pulling a single thing every now and then isn't a reason for you to start pulling the role minority card.
---
This is directed to the tanks reading this, but *you* OP.
---
It may seem like a lot of investment lost, but in totality you are barely a quarter of the way to level 60 in terms of total experience needed. I'd say wait until bgs, then reevaluate, but you are a prime candidate for rerolling (haven't even bought your mount yet).
---
Phase 2 is just a conspiracy perpetrated by mages to get you to buy more ports.
---
Other great loot drops from the same run.  Find a warrior who is farming for SGC (who has HoJ already), mage/lock who needs Ban'thok Sash, then bribe a healer to come by either offering them un-needed blues, or clearing to Golem.  You can do 5 Arena-Angerforge runs in under an hour (Golem adds a couple of minutes per run) as a 4-man group.  5% drop chance means an average of average of 4 hours to get an HoJ while helping other people gear in the process.  
---
Dedicate an hour a day and you'll get it in a week or two.  It's not that bad at all...  I saw 4 drop while farming for my SGC (2 before that), and most of my runs were 2 or 3-man Arena only.
---
What’s SM in this context?
---
When you incentivize people to be dicks it is disingenuous to then judge them for being dicks.
---
That's cool and all, but it's not what you originally said.
---
Progression guild will use them to get the first few kills. 
---
Folks that have not done the content before and hit AQ40 will find out that the extra HP makes a difference when you face the chance of an unlucky 1 shoot due to someone being out of position.
---
Shazzrah is equally bad or worse and my motivation to play is abysmally low lately. Alliance everywhere are getting shafted by Blizzard's inaction.

It'll level fastest with a fast bow.

Get int buffs, get a tank and go train it on the invincible mobs in the blasted lands.

Now remove 2 busses and fit all the people back on 1 bus.

No matter how those people line up or queue it aint going to change the fact that the bus aint big enough.

---
You'd have to find a way to scrape the chat for songs and output that into something outside of wow. An addon cannot do the entire process.
---
When solo, rather than sending your voidwalker into a pack of mobs, try hitting them with a dot or something to pull them toward you, then sending your pet to meet them half way so that he doesn't agro other nearby mobs. 
---
As for tab targeting, it's just something you need to watch for. Either pay attention to the mob you have selected via tab before spamming your abilities, or target them with the mouse. If the tank is marking the mobs, you could look into keybinds to target specific marks like a keybind to target skull, or you could macro it right in. Best to just slow down a bit and ensure the target you pick is the one you want to hit though.
---
Yep, all the way to 52, while running zf gy that is, anytime the pulls are less than 4 mobs I didn't feel like it was worth it
---
Classic is being ruined by groups of players that want to be able to control a whole server. This will drive away thousands of casuals (the lifeblood of wow) away and all that will be left is drama.
---
Necro as Hell but I'll input. I play on an Orbweaver Plus NagaHex. Orbweaver for movement on the d-pad, change left and right to strafe left and rigft. ctrl-shift - jump on the bottom row with a few action buttons. I rarely use the far left or the top row. I easily between the combination of modifier and keys have 32+ Reachable keybinds.
---
1-7
---
Shift 1-7 (mouse)
---
Ctrl 1-7 (Mouse)
---
Middle mouse, Shift Middle mouse, Ctrl Middle Mouse
---
Q,E,R
---
Shift Q,E,R
---
Ctrl Q,E,R
---
This an easy 33 keybinds, without moving my hands hardly at all from resting. 
---
I have keys on the 2nd from upper rows I hit as well and an easy button on the orbweaver to tab through targets. Essentially I have all of this without barely moving or straining my hands. In the current Pruning of retail this isnt as useful outside of arena macros. But in classic I can ctrl mod all of my consumes for PVE/PVP and easily use all of my buttons. Which as a warrior with stances and stance macros is nice.
---
The biggest problem is once you learn it; and enjoy how easy it is to have all of these buttons. You cannot go back to a standard keyboard easily to play again because you know how much better it can be. Which means laptop play honestly goes away without peripherals. Sometimes I wish I never switched because I feel shackled to this way of play because the standard KB/M is honestly clunky and not optimized for gaming but for typing and working.

Go for robe of winter night then, it can be purchased

I’m a fury warrior and have been 60 for more than a month, i’m still grinding bis. I just got my lionheart last week, i’m collecting mats for titanic legging, i still need cape from strat ud, i still need to grind mats for head and leg enchants. There are still a lot to do, i don’t think i will start an alt anytime soon.
---
&gt;we'd ALL be pissed if they hadn't done this and we literally couldn't find groups or raids in 6 months.
---
Which is the case if they put cap at 3k.
---
Gotcha
---
HS costs a shit ton of rage but causes increased threat and increased damage. Its useless when rage starved but can be spammed when rage is streaming in (e.g. raid bosses)
---
Woosh
---
Because I'm in a guild that I want to stay in that I have friends in and I have no clout.  The vast majority of players are in similar situations, I'm sure.
---
You have to make changes on Blizzard's end that will facilitate and encourage mass faction/server changes.  Asking individuals to start over and play without their friends is not a real solution.
---
Does healing taken include health from Drain Life, Siphon Life etc? Because if thats so that makes total sense.
---
Blizzard won't merge servers, I am pretty sure they have states so, because "people have the same names" etc.

Anyone know a good way to farm gold as a holy paladin with herbalism and alchemy? I also have a tank set with consecration so I try to farm sfk but the income is so slow and not steady that I just don’t know what to do. At 200g rn, aiming for 1000 at least
---
How do you figure phase 4 when you can replace it with Spellpower ring from MC right now?
---
I still don't see the issue, there's a lot of PvP, but leveling hasent gotten that much more difficult. sometimes the horde commandeer the boat to theramore, so take the one to Aberdeen. or form a group and fight.
---
I really think most of this is exaggerated
---
they're all humans and want the swords i guess.
---
Pull more mobs with a bow when questing.
---
The best strategy for pulling is generally to have a safe area u know is clear, then pulk with a ranged ability and drag the mobs back to u, enemies tend to be grouped so if u send ur pet in its aggro radius can easily grab extras
---
Okay i’ll do this from now on! :)
---
Im horde on rattlegore and can't leave most cities without being ganked. There were 5 alliance rogues killing anyone coming in and out of UC last night. I think PVP servers just aren't your thing. Good luck on the reroll!
---
You don't give dishonourable kills if you're low level. You only get dishonourable kills if you attack opposing faction civillian npcs. 11 levels or under just means that you don't give them an honourable kill.

I guess your still fury speced as pve dps orc with SR ?

Explain how you’re supposed to “get good” when there’s 6 lvl60s camping you.
---
Oh yeah all of us under 50 are coming for these assholes, and hard. Their days of unrestrained capitalism are ticking down, fast.
---
There's not much to do at lvl 60. Pvp is all there is... I hit 60 a month before honor was released and I found myself bored as shit, waiting for the next raid. Unless leveling is the main draw for you, this game was going to end up feeling shitty for you anyways.
---
this is an issue that all legacy servers face and is inherently unsolvable in my opinion. you can recreate the entire world exactly as it was in 2004, but you cannot recreate everybody having their first experience playing a MMO and being clueless about a lot of the factors of the game. a game being available for 15 years removes most of that "magic" that people had when they first experienced it because everything has been solved and figured out, the only thing left is the desire of improving yourself at the game which leads to the min-maxing culture you see today.
---
To elaborate on this... The current state of Rag is that every Wrath of Ragnaros is a complete threat wipe.
---
Here's a recent thread with some info:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e45pwf/melee\_dies\_on\_ragnaros\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e45pwf/melee_dies_on_ragnaros_help/) 
---
Have your all of your tanks Taunt asap after Wrath. Have an OT or 2 in FR gear get out with melee for Wrath, intercept after the MT gets knocked, and taunt immediately. When the MT intercepts back (or runs back if whiff the intercept), they then Taunt and take back over.
---
Taunt rotation by all tanks is advised for last 20%, as DPS Warriors will be executing and your MT in FR gear will likely not be able to keep up with them. However Taunt &gt; Mocking Blow &gt; Taunt &gt; Challenging Shout &gt; Taunt by the MT is usually good enough to hold through the last 20% if your raid's DPS is good.
---
These adjustments should make your melee DPS situation better.
---
I also went destro initially but respecced (in my 20s I think) into affliction, building towards SM/Ruin. Levelling became much easier. In dungeons stuff dies so fast I'm not sure it matters what you spec until maybe the level 60 dungeons (I'm only 55 atm).
---
For 1g I'd go for it without hesitation. For 10g I'd only do it after I had my mount, but I think it's still worth it.
---
An extra raid in the mountain every week for 90% of raiding guilds.
---
Us east servers are located in Chicago. Could you mean something else?
---
Did this change?  I thought trying to zone back into a dungeon you just reset, while players are inside, will just send you back to the same version of the dungeon you just left?
---
I’m nearly positive this happened to me 2 weeks back.
---
If each layer was equivilant to a healthy population server then why would they think jamming them all together wouldnt cause extreme issues.
---
fuck being Alliance in classic...
---
It's a ret paladin dude. You scared you're gonna lose to ret paladins?
---
But what about those of us who wants to play with higher pop servers, shouldn't we have a choice?
---
Lower pop is no problem, just try to convince your guild that its the superior choice (even with way less manpower, way more downtime etc.) and you can play you want, and the rest of us (the majority) can keep playing on high pop servers which are more ideal for classic.
---
Make the group/make the rules. They dont like it kick and replace them. 
---
At the end of the day, if your not having fun your doing it wrong. 
---
Lots of different ways to do dungeons and no one answer is the ONE ANSWER.
---
Actually you would. Some mobs are only (or mostly) soloable with Starfire, e.g. Tinkerer in Maraudon and basically any mob you kill with Entangling Roots + Starfire (like Devilsaurs).
---
Uh no boss will last a reset barring some game breaking bug.
---
I mean ages core hound gloves exist, as well as edgemasters hand guards. This isn’t so much on you, but if there were 8 people who all want the same pair of swords... I mean a few should realize they will probably never see them...
---
The supposed 1.1% drop rate on Wowhead is inaccurate because it doesn't drop off of Mizzle... it drops off of the Gordok Tribute chest.  It has an actual drop chance of around 15-20% in the Tribute chest, and you don't need to be present in the instance when it drops, so hunters people can solo the run and sell the chest contents.  
---
If you're too lazy to farm for HoJ, hang out in Dire Maul for an hour and advertise that you're looking to buy a Lodestone.  Buy a Tarnished Elven Ring or two while you're there as well.  Should be able to get all 3 for under 100g depending on your server's economy and time of day.  There's really no excuse to have a Carrot equipped if you're stepping foot in a raid instance.
---
Tbh I think it is the most natural and safe thing to not bend over in world design to the effect of increased population. To make the argument that they should maintain smaller populations is valid, but I think much trouble would emerge if spawn rates were tweaked.
---
&gt; I'm not aware of any 'slaughter rules' but if there is one then... well it's the rule of the game and therefore my point.
---
Sometimes it's a formal rule and sometimes it's not.  The broader point that ethics is "what is specified by law" is *wrong*.
---
&gt;Then I'm sorry but yes you can totally craft rules to fight against unethical actions and no it doesn't ruin WoW if the rules are smart
---
You can try, but you'll never create a perfect situation and you'll often make things worse.  Blizzard already tried...and the result was people wanting to play Vanilla WoW.  Somehow you learned nothing from this process.

All of your ideas are bad and would have unintended consequences.  They're typical overengineered bad ideas that attempt to force people to act in ways that you prefer.

Check out the subs r/PCmasterrace or r/BuildaPC. PCMR has a link to their website that has a number of builds to fit different budgets. Even the lowest-end one will be able to rock new games at pretty decent settings, so classic wow will be a cakewalk.

I like desktop over a laptop personally. For me, it's about the comfort. Video games are my way to relax and have fun, and I will have much more fun if I'm not hunched over a laptop. Desk tops also tend to last longer.

For OS, I vote Windows. Yes- it has privacy issues, but so do Macs. And if you use any Google, Amazon, or Facebook product then you already have a company that knows more about you than Microsoft ever will. Windows is more versatile and more affordable. You can buy windows 10 keys off Ebay for ~5$.

Yes the faction imbalance is bad and yes there are alot of morons on Horde who don't know about honor decay or are just doing it wrong. But it's really not that bad.

Unfortunately the addon is necessary for people who want to rank up in PvP. There's a reason everybody is using it.
---
People legitimately missed class buffs and mass consumable stacking. Retail got rid of this and changed to one battle and one guardian. Some might like it, some hate it. I personally love consumable stacking because it's just another way to help push it further while not absolutely neccessary for more casual players.
---
I am honestly disappointed in how weak your argumentation is.
---
On faction balance I agree, having bad ratios are bad for PvP servers. I am not arguing against that.
---
But server population? I disagree 100%, private servers had up 3x the concurrent cap of classic servers, and they played out better than the current classic servers.
---
And I think thats party because both factions just had more PvP fighters, like camping flightpaths for 8 hours in a row? You would never ever get away with on a private server since people would just say it in the world chat and send a death squad on you immediately.
---
No factions had supremacy in BRM either, even tho there was a lot of PvP there. We will see the effect of BGs, but that just didn't happen for long on balanced servers were both factions were willing to fight equally hard.
---
Right, I suppose I should have considered that. Not to mention the fact it's got a much more restrictive entryway than MC.
---
Is it ok that I haven’t put any talent points into improving his abilities yet? Oh also, when are good times to use Fear? Just pvp?
---
What are you transmuting for 30-40g every 2 days? Even Undeath to Water doesn't reach that on my server, though its close.
---
At 60 Warriors are basically the best at whatever you want to do, if you have the gear. Warriors are the tanks, fury Is number 1 dps and Arms Is a top pvp Specc as Long as you have a healer
---
All your stated problems are basically that you are solo and warriors in generell are dogshit at solo content
---
Got it I was just thinking he might need an upgrade but two of you said its fine until the low 40s
---
i forget the guys name but there was a twitch stream with one of the main guys from vanilla , i think pops were 2500-3000 back then but the actual game was designed for about 1500
---
the thinking was with 1500 active at the same time you could know a good number of the people.
---
he also said back then the servers were super fucking expensive , chances are they decide back then 3k was the most a server can handle 
---
chances are that was due to hardware limitations but if they did have the hardware to go above 3k im going to guess they may have increased some resource spawns and possibly put some level 60 guards in at least a few alliance towns lol 
---
i dont want any changes but i bet they would have tweaked things if 5k or possibly way higher was the norm 
---
from the pvp tab im guessing my server has at least 8k active players and because there are more regional servers prime time is prime time. not like vanilla when i played on a US server because my country had no servers so everyone is online at the same time
---
I just got Blackcrow on my 56 rogue last night after leveling with a bow, so that's what I plan to do tonight to skill it up. Hopefully it works out for me!
---
apologize
---
You just convinced me. Gonna leave this shit hole for a while.
---
In general, the community seems to be much more mature and cooperative than I've experienced elsewhere. You definitely are not expected to always be in character and the amount of actual RP will vary depending on your preferences but it's nice to have the option without pressure. The players on RP seem to be much more interested in doing what they enjoy rather than what they "should" be doing. This is still WoW so obviously people will still min/max but it's easy to find people to enjoy the process with. It's nice to enjoy the game without the constant pressure of doing this correctly. I have enjoyed aspects of the game I never did before such as cooking, fishing, and tons of other RP activities that make me actually feel like I'm in the world.
---
In my opinion, you can always go as hardcore as you want and find people to play with who are on the same page. If your goal is simply enjoying your time and avoiding the "always max efficiency" kind of culture, I think RP is the only place.
---
Nice!
---
Technically it is, but the elementals you need to kill to make it are level 35~38, so unless you can buy the stuff or get help you're likely not getting it til your mid-late 30's.
---
Guess we will see how it goes. 
---
I remember that boss was very unforgiving and the RNG of chain lightning being a kick in the dick that caused the most wipes.
---
How soon did you report afterwards?  
---
But yeah, I'd say that's worse than this.  At least Warriors can optimize around not having the Onyxia neck, and there are viable sidegrades down the line... whereas only 2 trinkets in the game have armor on them.
---
Loved the panda trailing behind.
---
I respecced to resto at 52 and have only done dungeons until 60. It takes a little bit longer, but since I enjoy healing it wasn't too bad.
---
Back in vanilla i lvled 51-60 in av grindind av
---
IF this gonna happen that you get camped at the GY... I have the simplest solution for it!
---
**Step away from the GY all together and let the horde/ally ANY Honor at all, after they start camping! You will be out pretty quick!**
---
My alliance main is on Heartseeker and the alliance/ horde imbalance is so bad horde are hard to find. I started a new alliance character on earthfury for this reason.
---
You gotta rely on / support group play. When u get pushed against 1 or 2 enemies directly in a group fight you'll have a much harder time surviving / killing them
---
What else am I going to do, just keep wanding until I actually have to throw a heal on the tank?
---
So what's the deal with frost mages and leveling? I've been told by multiple people to just ignore all my skills other than frost bolt and just frost bolt everything over and over and cast nothing else. Is this really the most efficient way to level as a mage?
---
this, and orange for pat
---
Hello me, nice to see me. How’ve I been doing?
---
Non-humor aside, I am in the same boat. I have been trying to do the ‘ole mage AoE farm on a mage alt and it has been hellacious. It’s just not fun when neckbeard 60s run in and camp 20-30s. It’s just for camping sake, and it wastes everyone’s time (despite how “fun” it is for the camper, they’re not gaining any tangible benefits. Just venting their REEEEEE). I want to transfer that alt to a PvE server but must slog on until that happens.
---
... is refilling worth it? Should I just cut my losses? Idk :/
---
I use them to sneak into BRM often, usually cuts it down to 1 or 2 deaths. Yeah there are ways to get around it but for more the more casual boomers it affects them more and leveling my alt is annoying
---
Yes, and without layering. PvP was still a complete shitshow while lvling, and people were still camping SG, BRM and all the same contested zones. But people from alliance were actually fighting back in organized groups, instead of running in solo like headless chickens and just getting picked off repeteadly.
---
My last week was 1.2million honor. We were doing 12-15k/hr i think. And that was only because of a couple chinese trying to take a br1 during holidays, where our caps were very low (~750k) so we could rank with a few days off. We try to keep it low, so people get weekends off or w.e, but assholes ruin it for everyone.
---
i literally killed an alliance yesterday in Orgrimmar b/c i saw them ganking an AFK horde
---
i assume it happens both ways
---
Quick alliance queues just means your going to have to compete against 1mil+ honor caps if you want any sort of high ranking.
---
Yea, talent however u want, u can look at wowhead or icyveins for spec ideas but in a group its more about being a team player, if u pull extra stuff using ur talented pet then use the one that stands next to u and shoots fireballs. Staying alive &gt; maximum dps
---
I'm not upset at all like you want me to be. I'm rolling around with 5-10 guildies in FW, WS, EPL, WPL, BS, SG, BRM taking out horde no problem :)
---
"It's become nothing but complaints..."
---
"*adds another complaint*"
---
That's the thing. All these neckbeards saying "Why didnt you go PvE then?!" don't understand that we have IRL friends that chose a realm from the start. Alot of my friends have quit because of the state of Kromkrush right now for Alliance. So here I am, unable to transfer and dealing with 40-50 minute runs just to START playing the game.
---
I'd be incredibly surprised if Blizzard haven't had logging enabled to flag when players are flooding servers with requests.
---
If an addon can effectively do this by mistake what would have stopped people using malicious addons to disrupt servers the entire time?
---
a rogue with maxed picklock skill ;)
---
Fear can be very powerful for killing mobs too. As it allows time for you and your dots to do damage  while you take no damage. Just watch for that feared unit then pulling adds.
---
Most of the brazilian community are on thalnos
---
The throttle is applied per person, yes.
---
If you'd read the last part of my post you'd know that I don't really see the benefit of having an ALT that I have to start from scratch on another server.
---
All my friends think I'm crazy for using ESDF. The rest my keybindings may be weird but I knew I wasn't the only one.
---
Nothing. Other than its one additional day of full raids traveling to BRM
---
No it isn't.
---
Forget Reddit. You want the true classic experience? Go back to the original Blizzard forums from the mid 90s. Blizzards online community has been a shit show going on a quarter century now.
---
Nothing is more infuriating than when both vanishes fail...
---
My friend actually got it at 30 with help and he was elated
---
*Laughs in Immolate*
---
This, as someone who begginned m+ with the last patch, this community is unwelcoming as fuck.
---
Even when you know your shit and output good Hps you will be shit at by DPS who don't know anything about m+.
---
The main thing is, that you need to know the dungeon very well as a healer or a tank to be able  to be that fast. Which doesn't apply to classic DPS, or barely.
---
Only one person can reach rank 14 at a time, if you are going against others and get a DHK you aren't reaching 14 that week.
---
I've seen druids with the party trinket. Feelsbadman
---
Fuck gnomies REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I bought mats and had a friend make me all the Shadoweave/Dreamweave stuff as soon as I could wear it. I have kind of a wacky schedule (don't really get long sessions) so I haven't run many dungeons for upgrades and I'm still wearing that stuff at 52. Should I start dropping it for superior stat (int/stam) gear even if I lose the spellpower? Feel like my HP hasn't moved up in forever (sitting 2200ish). PVP server if that helps.
---
There is no way that Heartseeker and Earthfury even come close to balancing it out. I'm not saying there'll be hour long queues or something, but there's definitely going to be much longer queues for horde than alliance no question
---
I did for a few weeks after I got a mageblade on my warlock. Got 5 or 6 99% parses which was cool.  I'm done flasking for now but it can be fun to go full sweat once in a while.
---
They are often found from the Satyrs in DME, which he included in his tip.
---
I wish we could get more people to use ANY consumables, like you don't need to flask, but showing up with the bare minimum elixirs/food/fire prot pots isn't very hard and makes it much easier for everyone.
---
you are the horde, you are the rapist
---
Yeap its really toxic..20 % of unbalanced servers keep whining and posting while most are balanced and people are enjoying WoW. Ppl saying stuff like "WoW is dying yet sooo many server are packed with queue both NA and EU
---
Tell your leaders to quit being stupid. My guild downed Rag our second week of raiding with a bad comp, no flasks, and just common sense of mechanics.
---
Thanks I was looking for this myself, very good for pvp
---
don't know don't care my guess is these guys are saving their DKP for the Swords and try to get the Dagger later. Brutality Blade already dropt like 4 times in my raid and Vis'kag twice.
---
Go to Blasted Lands and find a servant.  They don't die, because you have to click on the crystal to kill them.  You can just sit there for quite some time pummeling them.
---
Wait do you think people used to fight with honor?  Only real difference today is how minmax oriented people are.  It's easier to camp a flight path than just go ganking in stv.
---
Thats exactly my thought. Probably 95%-99% of all Black Lotus are not getting consumed right now. A Server generates around 100 Black Lotus every day, way more if you take layering into consideration. This means, that by the time BWL/ AQ getting released there will be 10000-20000 Black Lotus rotting on bank-alts. The price will not explode since people will undercut each other until a price range is reached were people are willing to buy the Lotus. Even the biggest tryhards are not gonna pay 350g+ for a flask.
---
pretty sure he's faking it my guy, i could be wrong, but every time i've seen him clips of him he seems like a troll
---
Myzreal (US) is great! The faction balance feels fantastic as well. I’m sure it’s mildly leaning towards alliance but there’s lots of horde
---
Yes. You can also aoe farm a lot if the enemies are all melee.
---
The number of times I've seen something and gone "Oh, cool, YES! -- oh, nvm" in the AH.
---
Ya gotta watch those details...
---
Can I have ur karma
---
You're about half way through the leveling process at 44.  It does get better, but not before a lot more pain.  Start looking for items that have +hit on them, they start to become available around your level.  As a hunger, I bought [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13052/warmonger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13052/warmonger) when I could equip it, at level 47.  It has 3% hit and let me tell you, it made a massive, noticeable difference right a way.  If there are any other classes that pique your interest, maybe try one out to see if you like it better.  The flip side of being half way through the leveling process is that although you've invested a lot of time, it's not too late to change characters.  A level 44 character can max out a crafting or money making profession, and be very useful to your future main.
---
Same. I run 0/30/21, and I can tank, heal, or DPS 5 mans. I carry tank, feral DPS, PvE resto and PvP resto sets. (Plus engineering)
---
Dont get me wrong your average guild wont be clearing it in a week but the top guilds from private servers have had harder versions of these bosses on farm for years.
---
There is nothing wrong with people playing the game as it is designed to be played. Don't play on a pvp server if you don't like it.
---
About 4 hrs a level has been my pace 8 to 10 hr days
---
Haha. I guess it's a really good idea then!
---
I tried this when I was a miner but the whole room of elite bugs would aggro. Didn't seem viable to me
---
Yeah the are only really necessary for raiding unless you really want to impress your dps lol. Still never a bad time to start farming em if you're bored.
---
This is the equivalent of saying you get wet when rained on... How do you remotely think you're the only person thinking this..
---
Old school meme
---
Ach, entschuldigen!
---
I suppose, but I wanted to keep the pun as far from conjugating it as possible. 
---
Though, now that I'm thinking about it, another joke to be had is just make some ungodly compound noun involving rogues, presents, shanks and poisons. 
---
Something like "Giftshivgeshenkshurke".
---
Germans! Come help me make this bad joke!
---
When they shook hands smiling at each other I was expecting some gnome to ambush and kill the undead.
---
Does using fear aggro other mobs? I’ve tried using it to set up the dots but then the mob ran towards another mob which came sprinting towards me as well.... lol
---
Well you can rest assured that when you get home from work or studying and just want to chill with a BG, you'll go straight into the action instantly. 
---
Good call mate.
---
Try a macro for single targetting
---
/tar TankName
---
/assist
---
Keep in mind tanks can change targets too so maybe ask for a skull marked on dungeon mobs. 
---
Go into your server’s discord and say you’re new and ask for a coach. Someone will likely help you and that might be easier than reading comments in reddit.
---
The cap should have been 5 or 6k, not 8-10k as its estimated.
---
It really has. The top post right now is about the ethics of world PvP... give me a fucking break.
---
Eventually all meele will have the neck so no reason they can't get their ring.

And the perk leads to a jerk ( ಠ ͜ʖಠ)
---
The Honor system needs BGs in the game to function properly.
---
Blizzard (and every other company that made an MMO) had 15 years to "create a better situation".
---
&gt; Then if your only argument is "your ideas are bad" and nothing else then it's not worthy to continue this conversation. I mean what would be the negative of not gaining honor from player with a lower level for example? what would be the problem if areas have a coefficient of honor gain to encourage/dissuade PvP in some location?
---
My argument is that attempting to engineer human behavior is very, very hard.  Your ideas are bad, would have unintended consequences, and basically reduce to the exact kind overengineered garbage that ruined the game in the first place.
---
Instead of learning something from that process (you are playing a 15 year old game for a reason, no?), you are whining on the forums, asking for the game to be ruined for a second time.
---
&gt; I mean what would be the negative of not gaining honor from player with a lower level for example?
---
You don't get honor from killing players if they're grey to you.
---
&gt; what would be the problem if areas have a coefficient of honor gain to encourage/dissuade PvP in some location?
---
Blizzard already tried this with World PvP objectives (EPL Towers, Halaa, Silithyst, etc) and *no one used them*.  If you force people to go to some zone for World PvP, you just create zergs, which are awful.
---
The only semi-reasonable suggestion to "fix" the honor system is to remove it completely.  This will never happen.  The second best thing would be to...release TBC, which generally fixed these problems in a somewhat reasonable fashion (but created problems of its own).  I expect they'll release TBC next.  In the meantime, enjoy Vanilla for what it is.  It's not perfect but all of your ideas would only make it worse.
---
Ya this subreddit is pure shit.  If you disagree and provide sound logic to curb someone complaining needlessly about anything you're downvoted to oblivion.
---
Dude, we haven't even been discussing this, so what are you on about? I've played Horde for 12 years and I switched for Classic to relive the experience as Alliance. I have to say, the Horde this time around are genuine assholes. It has nothing to do with how many  Alliance are willing to PvP or anything of the sort, though I do agree that Alliance are obnoxiously timid more often than they should be.
---
Regardless, no one who actually played Vanilla could reasonably be expected to know that the private server culture had become this dark and demented.
---
Its estimated at 6k actually.
---
Just look at these graphs of two of the most popular server:
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4475_Shazzrah
---
Yes, they have some peaks at 10k, but that was with layering, and all the recent peaks (since layering was removed) seems to be at 6k.
---
Which is 1/3 of the concurrent that worked on pservers.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that... So really theres no problem with them being there..
---
I think its fine.
---
Yes it is.
---
I hope you like being corpse camped in the open world. Without BGs that's about all there is left.. way to shoot yourself in the foot.
---
Thanks for the detailed response.
---
If you're unlucky - you might well be competing with 10 or more casters, each wanting two rings, with the average guild seeing something like one ring every 3 weeks to a month, you could be waiting a long time before you get a Ring of Spell Power.
---
90% of the complainers on this forum are just sore losers with no mental resiliency. They wouldn't be crying so much if they had more opportunities to bash the opposition like they themselves get bashed.
---
Not quite sure what you mean by "rudimentary raid meter", but with Grid and mouseover macros I'm pretty well covered on all other bases. I got Grid showing every relevant raid debuff I can think of, and different (corner) markers telling me whether someone is affected by poison, disease, curse or magic debuffs, as well as incoming heals/missing HP, mana bars, raid markers and aggro while being non-intrusive and simple to look at. I've lately read that Grid2 comes with some built-in LibHealComm, but I also got the one called "HealComm" just to be one the safe side as I don't know how well those crosstalk. 
---
Mouseover macros and shift/ctrl/alt mod macros take a while to set up the first time, but I'm pretty used to them by now and don't feel any need to change. Lots of room to customize them, too.
---
Wiley-Coyote-dollar-bill-eyes grinning, if I had to guess
---
They do that on my server (Earthfury) even though its been proven it's close to 50/50 and they practically own EPL/WPL. The only place we really own is Winterspring and kinda go back n forth in BRM.
---
I can barely level. I've stopped getting on unless I've saved up a ton of rested XP and can farm some super-safe/super-boring area
---
I care
---
As I said, 2-3 arrows is almost the entire mobs HP for the 1st 5 levels. Just after 5  and before 10 they do start to slow down a bit, but we aren't talking about that.
---
Ain't like the mods are doing shit about it. They only moderate the subreddit if a post breaks the rules.
---
Everyone uses honor spy on Netherwind and there is zero lag. I doubt it is due to honor spy solely.
---
This advice can be applied to almost anything in the game in a general sense. 
---
"Don't  expect much from others and just improve yourself as a player." 
---
Why whenever I play tank in any game, I expect my whole party to either suck or make mistakes, and I get better as a tank to reduce fuck ups.
---
happy cake day btw
---
&gt; You have to read tea leaves on every group and hope you can figure the groove out quickly.
---
As a tank, this is why I do not run pugs if I can avoid it.  I know the dps and healers in my guild.  I know what they are most likely to do/not do in any given situation.  Random pugs are just all over the place.  I can generally pull 4+ mobs in any level 60 dungeon with no CC with the healers from my guild without even throwing a shield on.  Can my pug handle that?  No way to know till I try.  Will dps swap from single target to AoE and back as needed based on mob types/abilities?  No way to know even if I ask.
---
I am not saying pugs are all full of bad players.  I just happen to have hours of chemistry with people in my guild.  We know how to work together.
---
I member
---
It is, if I were camping someone and they kept doing this I would leave them alone
---
Pretty sure the classic cap is around 10k, right? What pserver had a 30k cap? Lol.
---
Just make it so that someone with a &gt;12 lvl gap are incapable of damaging each other.
---
Lvl 60s can't touch anyone under 48 &amp; vice versa.
---
Sure, it's 1/3 of a crit and 10 AP all the time vs a chance at silencing your target for 6 seconds.
---
I love pvp, but that sounds fucking miserable
---
&gt;And its twisted because you are alliance and threat doesnt really matter on the easy-mode faction.
---
I was actually thinking about arguing some more, but it's obviously pointless, you're just here for (you's).
---
Looking forward to dabbing on you in BGs with my perds.
---
Stay mad.
---
BWL is not puggable either
---
Not if they manage to dismantle our means of fighting back first. *cough* fascist dictatorship *cough*
---
They are miles ahead of us.
---
??? This is a MC run escorting their tanks and priests back to the instance after getting the FR buff. 
---
This is also outside UBRS not MC
---
He's talking about AOEing the non-elites using the princess scepter.  There's only 1 elite Hydra you need to sneak by using an invisibility pot. (You can solo kite/kill, but it is kinda a waste of time and risky)
---
I could see a case being made for the buff in that it allows more TPS gear equipped over some FR pieces.
---
A 60 camping redridge would be considered against TOS
---
The tank can benefit from a bit of fire resist, if only to make the healers lives a hit easier.
---
Right!? How can a company be consistently slow across all IPs? When the fuck is the Overwatch patch coming out!? We've been in a damn tank meta for forever!
---
Grab Dejamark and bind it to a key and just mark the fuck out of everything.  the markwheel pops right up on your cursor
---
If honor is their motivation, they'd not be in a gang of 10 camping the flight point to kill you on landing.
---
honorspy is almost useless now anyways. if you cant already see the enemy player when they show up on honorspy then idk what to say
---
Hunters can kite tank ossirian
---
There is noticeable lag on Shazzrah too at peak times, especially the chat so I think it’s a problem across all high pop servers (maybe because of honorspy)
---
He made an update, chill out
---
No, it isn’t.
---
What is an open auction?
---
What is a closed auction?
---
I got 1 free cast and trinkets don't worry, even when we're oom we're not really oom ;)
---
I'd say 52 at the earliest, but I'd personally wait until 54/55 that way you can guarantee yourself a spot in any BRD run.  You certainly can run it at 52 but sometimes groups are picky and if you dont have a guild/bunch of friends with you it might make it tough to find groups.
---
Again, for the millionth time, I don’t think people expected megaserver populations. It’s  one thing to have WPvP on a regular server, but multiply that by 3-5 and you have a game that isn’t functioning how it should.
---
&gt; This is a complete lie 
---
This is proof of the evil and corruption present at 2019 Blizzard/Activision.  Flagrant, intentional, and malicious lying of the most serious degree.  What a loathable deception this error message is.
---
Oh no Arthur, what will be of this community if you leave? Please don't do this to us!

holy shit you are bad at tanking then lol

Maybe refer to the realm name, then the name of the ZF 2h epic sword, you dense knob...

---
The sunk cost fallacy only applies if a large number of resources has already been invested, without a clear return on that investment in sight. Because of this sunk cost, it is argued that continued investment will make the previous investment eventually worth it.
---
Your argument that not wanting to switch servers is a sunk cost fallacy does not hold, because there is no return on investment at the end of the process. If my goal was to get a legendary weapon or whatever, you may be right. But that is not my goal. My goal is to have a fun distraction after a long day of working. The sunk cost fallacy literally cannot apply here, because the situation does not meet the requirements for this fallacy to hold.
---
Arguing by logical fallacy is very dangerous, because you need to fully understand what each fallacy actually means. Many people use them wrong, at which point they only confuse the discussion. You also have to be aware of the fallacy fallacy, which says that even if you correctly identify a logical fallacy, the other party may still actually be correct. They just didn't properly present their arguments for it. I'm getting the feeling you're dismissing everything I say because you think you have identified a fallacy in my argument. This also further degrades the quality of the discussion. Please engage directly with what I say, instead of trying to put labels on my arguments. It'll be much more productive.
---
That being said. I'd like to present this analogy as a counterargument to your questions. Let's say I liked a certain movie, but I'm really not having a good time watching the sequel. Clearly, I should just turn off the sequel and watch something else. Your argument implies that the solution would be to watch the first movie again. For some people, that's a great solution. But a lot of people will not be interested. They've seen it before, they don't want to see it again, even though they actually liked it the first time around!
---
While this analogy certainly is not perfect, I think it demonstrates my point. I don't want to level again. I've been there and done it. Right now I want to play endgame content, for which I have worked for hundreds of hours. Rerolling is not an option because I will not get enough enjoyment out of that experience to warrant me actually playing the game. This does not hold for everyone, but it does hold for many people. And I think that you do not respect this sentiment. You're calling it a logical fallacy, while it really is not. And even if it were, this is a game. If I don't _think_ it is fun, it doesn't matter what logic dictates.
---
Believe me most of those people are just doing it because they have to. Being on the overwhelming side you can't really find enough enemies in the open world. Yes, there are grieflords out there but they are a really small minority. I play on a 30-35% percent Alliance and have talked to many of those camping hordes and they admitted they actually hated doing this as it is not even fun. Also when im leveling my 31 alt in Wetlands, myself and the rest of the lowbies never got killed by lvl 60s there and they just ignore us prooving further my point that they're doing it so because of the issues i mentions above (faction imbalance and inefficient guards).
---
you are arguing with low skill low IQ warriors it's not worth it
---
You should be able to do some math to help you out with this, and he raises a good point.
---
First of all even with dual wield spec you lose 25% of your offhand damage. So you gain 13.5 dps from swapping the dagger in to your offhand. 
---
You lose the 5% chance to proc your mainhand. Let's say this swap costs you about 2% of your overall damage. If you normally did 300 dps, you'd lose 6 dps from that alone. If you do 400 dps, you'd lose 8 dps. 
---
Overall, yes, you are going to do more damage with the Perdition's blade offhand. But it won't be nearly as much as you think. Maybe a net of 5-7 dps.
---
Interesting. It definitely feels busier than the big pservers I've played on. I guess BGs pull a lot of people out of the world.
---
how many clears have you done ?
---
Stuck in pvp server and alliance gank squads are all over. Just wanna hit 60 already, im 56. Wpl and winterspring are death traps. I have already rerolled once. I leveled my first char to 50 before rolling. No fucking way im gonna spend another eternity on pve server to level yet another toon. Server change or unsub. Im sure many players agree. Alot of people just losing interest in game because its corpserunning. Also dungeon spamming is just worst. Especially since you cant even enter the BRM dungeons. I played original vanilla and pvp happened, but dont have single memory of being molested by 10man group. Maybe if i ran to random ony or mc/bwl/whatever raid but outside that it was just asshat rogues trying hard and more hunters instead of those 9001 mages.
---
I love how the term "useless" is used all the time. This sub is not about use. If you have a question, sure, but beyond that it is about fun. And I like memes. I like this sub more than any other. I don't know what you want.
---
&gt;I say no to both. Keep Classic WoW, just classic.
---
Forcibly updating Classic servers to tbc would be a terrible idea, but what's wrong with opening new tbc servers with the **option** to port your classic character to the new tbc server?
---
Honorspy and Spy are completely different addons.
---
In classic we went MC to halfway through Naxx without ever really using Elixirs.
---
wow isn't a difficult game.
---
1-2 weeks (couple full raids). We are fairly liberal with our loot right now (since a few PUGs join us, its open rolls/one per); however, once we have 35+ only in guild for the run, we’d prioritize to full “raider” over our “member/app” rank. We used to do 3-5 weeks in retail, but I don’t think Classic pace supports that.
---
I loved playing on ND, but I can’t say they handled respawns beautifully. Some quests were inoperable because things would respawns too fast. Escort quests were virtually impossible.
---
For optimal PvP dominance you should reroll SL warlock, horde. Never lose a 1v1 again.
---
thanks for the info.
---
You can do that directly in game much more efficiently. 
---
But dont forget, your own faction is also your competition. You compete for resources with them more than you do with the enemy.
---
My personal favourite are the erratically pathing wind elementals in Dire Maul West.  Someone always insists we skip them.  While it is possible I have yet to see it executed.
---
Not always. Sometimes it's a pull where you have to run a bit of a distance to LOS the mobs. While you're waiting for the mobs to run over you're not doing any dps and renew can pull aggro. I actually stopped using renew on such pulls for this reason.
---
Basically the same minute I handed the quest in.
---
How would you know how much honor the rest of your faction has what your placement is without it? The only way to consistently rank up without this information is to play 24/7. Honorspy lets you take breaks when you are at the top.
---
you're likely bad at healing, do some more reading on how to manage your mana
---
Yea they give us females literally just underwear as pants for some of the gear that we can get. And some of the gear we can make in tailoring is just a colored crop top XD
---
How exactly does that work?
---
...Do you know what the term "unironically" means?
---
OP will come back to this post for like next 7 months cherishing each comment.
---
I can feel the edge from here
---
Im not mad. I am simply giving the exact facts. 
---
Rogues are very likely to move onto swords in BWL phase horde side.
---
Tanks benefit greatly from going daggers, and aren't taking BiS weapons from anyone when they do so.
---
Human rogues' BiS is always swords. Horde rogues' BiS is always swords.
---
Tank's BiS is daggers.
---
I play a plated out warrior with raid 2 hander. I am not scared of a rogue in pvp. Hell, I am not scared of 3 rogues in PvP.
---
This exactly. 2 hunters to ensure that a tranq shot is available for every frenzy. No more, no less.
---
I think its because people lvled up way wayy faster on classic, due to rampant layer abuse and without PvP.
---
On the pservers lvling took forever unless you were immediately ahead of the curve to PvP, and all that shit. No AoE respawning mobs, no dodging PvP by switching layer etc.
---
Wondering what to teach my wolf as far as beast training for specifically raiding. Furious howl, dash, and bite are obvious givens. Thinking fire resist and stamina? Not sure what’s optimal. I know the wolf is basically just there to buff you, but I can’t help but think there is some way to optimize some of these passive abilities
---
It doesn't sound like you do very many pickpocket runs. Vanish is still completely broken. I experience this bug all the time on my pickpocket runs.
---
Honestly if I could kill gnomes for honor on alliance characters I would, they should give bonus honor
---
It's you who misses the point. The game is what it is. It's an organic world and this is the pvp of classic wow in 2019. 
---
Also it become very clear who has the upper hand after just one fight. Smart players don't continuously engage in fights they know they can't win. And yes most people prefer to win than to lose.
---
As I understand it private PvP servers got killed to a greater or lesser extent (depending on server) by Horde overpopulation and as time went by this process happened quicker on newer servers.  There was one graph I saw here showing that activity had dropped by 2/3 on classic since phase 2 started.  People can moan about carebears all they want but essentially if this trend continues there is zero chance we will see BC Classic.
---
People were almost in tears this week when honor wasn't updating correctly. It was pretty funny to watch.
---
I don't even play WoW, but I must say, I enjoyed watching this subreddit's tone slowly change.

---
What sorta honor difference is there between AV and WSG and wPvP? In terms of percentages. I'm assuming WSG will be the best?
---
They could have and it would have been a great solution. But they didn't and we have to deal with the current situation instead of wishing for what ifs.
---
Lmao this was epic!
---
Crusader, the only other thing youd put on a dagger is +damage if it was main hand, and thats only because of BS mod %
---
I understand that I'm just saying from a design philosophy, I think having potential future merges with names saved across the potential merge groups would have been the best option. 
---
If the servers die, they are merged and everyone keeps their names. 
---
If they aren't merged, the only loss is some names were reserved but not actually on your server.
---
Sucks when both sides are stubborn and don't give up, so they end up pushing back and forth for hours.
---
Cri moar ded deeps, your tears feed me 😂

KEEP YER FEET UNDERGROUND
---
The amount of times some dps/ healer complains about clearing extra packs so I stop and then they ass pull mid fight is infuriating. Or a dps pulling a group because I'm waiting for the hesler with 40% manager to _start_ drinking. People are in such a rush...
---
yes.
---
not by default.
---
thats a strange way to spell Greater mana potion, healer life

Skeram is one of the worst servers balance wise and this 5:1 talk is bullshit. We've seen the pvp pool size and it's 60:40 so other servers are probably even closer to 50:50

---
This is my current spec. It's not the best for pure solo, but it gives a little bit more ranged damage
---
and then when they don't give a shit or realize (because let's be honest, how would they know you logged out while dead?) you just added 20 seconds to your run back to feel smug self gratification.
---
Yeah. BG queues. I will have the worst of both worlds. Long queues and alliance ganking me.
---
Cant grind anything when the game ends in a 5min baserace.
---
Blizzard has casted a META fog on azeroth.
---
You will be honorless but they won't know that. They will kill you anyways.
---
Nah.
---
Weakauras can show icons with remaining time, I set up a few for all my rogue cc abilities, but currently only for the enemy I'm targeting, not sure how to do it for other targets

Not happening.

As a mage, this hurts to hear about other mages not getting the appropriate training to help out in runs &gt;.&lt;
---
wut.
---
Yay blizzard
---
yes they are, unfortunately. But the point I'm trying to make is they are doing it the wrong way! Their way is fine for fun and morale boosting etc, but you only get about 5-10 honor per kill that way. Going out and farming honor the way I do nets the same amount of honor - I get 200 honor a kill instead of 5-10 honor. I may only get 20 kills a day, but thats still 2k-4k honor. AND I get paid for all the herbs. AND the other faction doesnt get any of them today! Your killing like 12 birds with one single stone by running the herb route instead of skirmishing.
---
Coming from a huntard, ok deeps bruh, enjoy that repair bill, you aren't getting rezd
---
I play a tank, a tank who does his job. You must be the other guy
---
I am not. Honorspy causes lag because it attempts to sync up databases between all other users, and it inspects everyone nearby as well. Once you reach critical mass in an area it starts to become a problem, like yesterday at peak time on my server in Org, where the game basically froze if you were there.
---
It has been addressed by the Developer of the app. The cause was because they set the default sync to sync with everyone anytime someone dies. The other option was to sync with the guild, which limits the sync significantly. Apparently that is the new default on the newest version.
---
Either way no one should use this addon or any addon that breaks the game in this manner.
---
Ouch, my bad I got distracted. The proper phrasing would be "portal to", though I am not sure if login has this 5 min flag window or not.
---
Private server players tend to be more tolerated of these issues though.
---
Like, private server guys just laugh at rooftop exploits , collusion or permacamping because thats what they are used to.
---
I believe resisting the knockback effect caps at 75% @ 315 FR.
---
CLEAR COMMS
---
Blizzard needs fractured-but-whole.
---
And eventually these morons will ruin their servers and their own experience. Poetic justice honestly. 
---
Just a shame it will also make blizzard think they were right about 'you think you want it, but you don't'
---
Twitter, but for legitimate feedback. That'll up the quality around here!
---
According to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4w5lg/helpful_tip_for_corpse_runners/) thread on the frontpage, yes.
---
As for knowing whether enemy is honorless, I don't believe so, at least not without an addon.  I have clicked on opposing enemies directly after they land from a flight and I saw no icon stating they were honorless.
---
I don't even know what honor spy is but I had major lag too
---
I'm on incendius alliance side. If you want to do anything in Black Rock (BRD,UBRS,LBRS, ect...)
---
Be prepared for atleast a 30 min deathcrawl.
---
It sucks.
---
Its not my stance on the issue, I am for any good solutionts that give 50/50 ratio.
---
I just think Blizzard do server mergs.
---
Can't remember where I heard it, but here is a thread discussing it at least.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/did-anyone-catch-it-when-blizzard-said-they-wont-be-merging-servers/170900
---
Damn right. Now spamming an AoE on a tower for 16 hours a day, 31 days a month so you can get a rank that lets you get the gear needed to spam and AoE on a tower for 16 hours a day slightly harder? Now THAT'S real end game.
---
Except this is obviously not true. When honor first released you not only had servers with less than half the population, but you also had an honor system where nobody knew anything about how it worked, nor did anyone have access to the honor halls where they could see the gear for the first few weeks which meant there was not the same incentive to farm people as there is now.
---
With the game fully "figured out", it means a lot more players are a lot more determined to rank up which means a lot more fierce competition than it ever was back in the day.
---
I know, I was there on two different servers as Horde and Alliance. Saying the same thing happened back then as is happening now is just flat out incorrect.
---
World pvp gives about 2-3k honor per hour based on spot and stuff. I think maybe up to 4k. Premade pvp gives up to 15-20k honor per hour based on queue times and how fast you clear pugs. As for WSG vs AV. We really don't know yet, based off the AV beta test it looks like AV might just be the best thing.
---
Hmm, that’s quite a neutral portrayal. You didn’t even include the parts where you can’t take a boat or roam the open world without getting zug-zugged by a 30 man death ball. A third of the flight paths are camped by zug-zugs 24/7. Maybe it’s just my server.... but probably not.
---
Fair enough. Mine is loot council which probably makes things a little blurrier. Most things sound the same but people tend to feel obligated to go ham on the consumes once others do, I suppose. Especially when officers start flasking up.
---
Why's your gear breaking?  don't you guys have vanish?
---
Hyperbole aside, Black Lotus will never reach 1k gold.  The price point is set by supply vs demand, and the demand will take into consideration the cost vs value.
---
depends on your drops on tank gear if they might wanna pop a flask the first week or two till they get a big more gear.
---
For mages, healthstone shares cooldown with mana gems so I often end up forgetting I even had a healthstone.
---
Nah, my point was that players don't really lose anything from rolling pve if they don't like world pvp. Which i don't, but that's subjective.
---
Thank you mate
---
I want to see how skewed my server is, it feels like 80% horde dominated I swear. I sat in ghost form while I ate in blackrock mountain, and I saw nothing but waves of horde coming in and 1 or 2 ally dying on their way in.  I think Ally are so hard to find in our server horde are roaming dead areas for people to kill.
---
Server mergers would have the exact same problem imo. How would you know in advance which servers would be the "worst offenders" in terms of community imbalance so you could give the players warning before hand?
---
I agree that the populations are too high and the cap should be the original cap, I defended that heavily when people were discussing this before launch, I also defended that the honor system was so bad that following a "normal" no changes progress would mean that something like this would happen. I don't agree that mergers are better, because you have no way to determine which servers would be merged before hand, which would lead to the same issues we've had since the beginning of the franchise and classic
---
Server mergers means that all of the aspects of the game are instantly affected in an unpredictable way, the PvP progression, PvE progression, leveling, economy and "power" of each guild, community, character, etc., is shifted. I was part of a server merger in vanilla, it sucked balls and the server got worse so I can't support mergers, my server was low pop and they merged it with a server that was low pop but had a very dominant guild, that completely fucked everything up for the community that didn't have that problem. Merging is long term layering imo without half of the control since you can't control how communities will react to being challenged by people they never had the chance to see or interact before, and community is the main selling point of classic
---
You can't force people to go to a server where they would be at a disadvantage themselves, you shouldn't (imo) force a paying customer to wait on a queue because he chose the more populated faction while others joining a lot later would be playing the game instantly. The right approach would probably be faction specific transfers and I believe (like most) that Blizzard dropped the ball there. Everything else is more a reaction to the game itself rather a Blizz problem, how are you going to control imbalances when Horde is clearly favoured across almost all PvP servers? Impossible without changes imo
---
Lol
---
Filter out the sea of posts complaining, it is not conducive to discussion.
---
&gt; critical of its source
---
Yea, this is exactly why ironforge.pro is questionable. If one raid uploads logs and one doesnt, you get 50% of the data.
---
By contrast, it doesnt matter who runs the who queries, just that it's done often enough to actually capture all players. 
---
You could tell me what your point is, a s why you think who queries are a bad way of seeing who's on a server.
---
You can just play on a medium server you know.
---
Amazing
---
I dont know if it is true as I never played on those servers, but I saw it mentioned a couple of times here lotuses did indeed reach 1k on pservers.
---
Because the type of PVP they are talking about doesn't exist. They want PKing and PVP, not "cross-faction dueling" which is essentially what you're describing.
---
Unfortunately not having queues to balance out server imbalance has ruined good world PVP.
---
There really is a huge gap between good healers and healers who don’t really know what they are doing. I’ve had healers not need to stop for mana at all and I have had healers every pull need to stop. The biggest thing inexperienced healers need to realize: their job is to keep the team alive; not keep them at 100% HP during fights.
---
I never AOE'd leveling as a mage.  Just frostbolt, frost nova, frostbolt.
---
Took about 7 days played to get to 60.  Can be done faster if you do AOE pulls of certain mobs (layering helped, but is no longer in the game).
---
This shit's been known for 15 years.
---
Just watching this video pisses me off to no end.  Yeah, get your HKs but Jesus, you motherfuckers need to allow people to play the game.  The P2 release date was way too soon IMO, only try hard no-lifers aren't done leveling and now us casuals are suffering just trying to get to 60.  And unless you're running with a raid group, you're dying over and over. Real Fun Blizzard.
---
Yeah, sure.
---
But we are not used to faction imbalance, or passive players that watch their teammates die in wpvp while they are running away.
---
On private servers, if you were camping FPs in Menethil, people would just call it out in worldchat "Menethil FP is being camped" and a fucking alliance deathsquad would arrive and massacre the campers.
---
Not like on current classic where alliance just seems to have their balls cut off, and lets horde get away with anything.
---
thanks will do.
---
After this post, I came across this: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aUwpMF1IiCy7KeM9ecneFLD4rjMWbF8aHTl\_vYFFXik/edit#gid=564315989](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aUwpMF1IiCy7KeM9ecneFLD4rjMWbF8aHTl_vYFFXik/edit#gid=564315989)
---
They don't understand that there is much more to the game than hk's. Honor is netted much higher from killing one person, then moving on. 200 honor a kill instead of 5-10. Id much rather roam for herbs and get 200 honor a kill than stand around, mostly running back to my body to get 5-10 honor a kill in a skirmish group.
---
Agree.  The community felt pretty good in the months before release, when everyone was super hype.  Then the first month or two of leveling was different and more crowded but also fun.
---
Now it's nothing but salty alliance bitching about wpvp.  Every thread.  Every day.  We get it.
---
I don't want to talk about it
---
Well it could very well be that enforcing faction balance would solve the FP camping simply by equalizing fighters on both sides.  If so then yeah, cool, whatevs.  Like I said, server pop to me is negotiable since the primary problem is the faction imbalance.  I'd love to see faction caps accompanied by free faction changes implemented immediately.
---
i leveled my mage as single target frost which makes me a bit of a black sheep here but i just wasn’t that into the aoe thing plus most of the spots i tried were taken. my rotation was usually something like FB - FB - FB - nova - strafe away-  FB - Fireblast/Scorch/Wand until dead. it’s not really ideal to just let mobs wail on you while you cast so use that nova to gain some space. bonus points if you have shatter
---
Did you mean to email this to blizzard or something?
---
If you dont have 3 geared warriors yeah you might want the guy in blues to pop one on BL lashlayer lol
---
Ok sorry u not boomer
---
Unfortunately all it takes is everyone else using it to lag out the game. We need to get a majority of the people to uninstall or update it to see any relief.
---
This is also a major reason to not download addons willy nilly especially ones with no real time troubleshooting or support.
---
Problem with this way of thought in a game that has PvP is you can extend the same logic train to killing players in the open world, period.  Inflicting pain/suffering/displeasure on others is unethical.  People don't like dying in games.  As such, killing them under any scenario is technically unethical.  Clearly this isn't the way most people want to play the game.  You could argue humans are predisposed to enjoying competition and as such keeping their more unsavory pleasures confined to games/simulation is about the most ethical thing they can do.
---
TL;DR slay away, motherfuckers.
---
I stayed shadow till 60. Never healed scholo/strat but I was able to heal everything else including rend runs and a full ubrs.
---
Omg you just made my WoW at 60 experience so much easier I was completely unaware you could macro chat commands. No more spam typing over and over again for my millionth anger/arena run.
---
None of ur dps are trying at all. Only 2 ppl in ur raid brought the cheapest consumables, everyone else had none, ur warriors are all arms which is screwing u on debuff slots and crippling their own dps. Looks like pretty much everyone is using the wrong skill priority or misusing their cooldowns
---
Can confirm, would still kill you for no honor.
---
And those Horde players think they are good at the game.
---
You should use your pet, but have it on passive so it doesnt attack and follow an unwanted mob (as it can pull others).. Use the attack command instead to get it to attack the mob you want. And generally use imp instead of void walker in dungeon (or succubus if you have it).
---
It wont, you dont get weapon skill from attacking players.
---
Daily discussions that are about game content, like farming, professions, etc.
---
Same as with retail. My friend is a Mythic plus geared 120 tank and we did a load of instance runs on Sunday to help level me.  You would think people would be pleased to have a tank who is out damaging the DPS and out healing the healer.  But 2/3 of the runs had a DPS or even a healer that would pull mobs or even bosses at every opportunity.  And we only had 3 spaces in the group each time (because I was there too).
---
Errr what happened with our conversation?
---
You're not wrong, but I didn't notice a lot of negativity until Phase 2 PvP released. It really does suck pretty bad right now on the lower faction on a PvP server and it seems to be getting worse.
---
"A balanced test of skill" I'm not sure I've ever heard counterstrike described as such, but if you like.  
---
My guild with two raids of 80 people consistently and regularly wipes combined raids of upwards of \~300 players.  
---
In fact we spend most Wednesdays PVPing in BRM doing exactly that as Alliance on a Horde dominated Server.  
---
Coordination, positioning, strategy and consumables are what you need to wipe larger groups, the game is designed around requiring large groups of people to band together and fight...now you might not like the gameplay that that creates but it was by design.  
---
I played in 2005, this is exactly what honor phase was like on my PVP server.
---
Can you reset your own instance while still in the instance then?
---
When you do it, what level of mobs is best? Like a couple levels below you?
---
even back in vanilla bwl was def pugged by players from good guilds that don't schedule anything under aq anymore, and alts
---
Looks like u and the healers are carrying them hard
---
Ah yes, but you see, the #nochanges streamers and fanbois wanted the higher caps, so there we are.
---
You forget, in the imagination of Alliance players everything was honorable 1v1 duels on perfectly balanced servers back in Vanilla.  /s
---
We have a top 100 speed clear and not a single person flasks lol
---
The problem is that the people who really want to transfer are the alliance on horde dominated servers.
---
Horde dont care
---
Are you saying that blizzard is allowing an addon to create so much traffic that it literally DDOS'es the chat servers?
---
I don't believe it, and even if it's true. I'm not going to uninstall honorspy. I need that addon, I'm going to ask those mongoloids at blizzard to fix the chat so addons can't break it.
---
Unflag?
---
Which only means they will increase the spawns even more.
---
It doesn’t break the game. This is a false claim. Been using it since day 1.
---
Add server flairs
---
I don't think so. See this post for example. Op provided no suggestions, offered up nothing to further discussion and honestly just made a post saying "this place sucks, bye" pretty much. 
---
Threads like these and the countless "this is what it's like playing as x faction on y server, blizzard I HATE you!!!1" add nothing of value and can be deleted.
---
I know it varies a lot but I have only seen 1 selling on my server and they were asking for 1200g, I have no idea if it sold. What are people seeing Pristine Hide of the Beast selling for? The 3 things that get made from it are pretty underwhelming considering the cost.
---
Reminds me a lot of the pathway down to Onyxia aswell
---
This so so so so so much.
---
bag space of "someone who camps flight paths with 3 others who camp flight paths as well" \*
---
Oof, you're one of these people...Carry on then
---
I've heard of rogues standing on the shacks in Stromguard in Arathi and range attacking the shaman ogres. They will cast until they run out of mana, evade, full heal and gain 2-3 casts worth of mana, and resume casting and being attacked. You'll never have enough DPS to kill them before they evade and heal and you're in a pretty isolated location so little chance of being messed with. Bring about 1000 arrows and you'll be maxed. Probably is ToS somehow tho.
---
A less ToS violating method might be the ghosts in DMN on the balcony around the last boss.

Oh for sure! And I use wowhead all the time.
---
Will be curious to see how it affects each faction as well. Anecdotally I would say Smolderweb (NA PVP) is very Horde Dominated when it comes to about 3 out of 4 zones for lotus farming.
---
I have personally seen 5-6 of my guildmates reroll Herba in just the last week after I told them I am near 100 lotus myself as I prep for the later phases and potential spikes.
---
Problem will be balance tho.
---
did you write it beneath each other ? in 2 seperate lines ? like any other macro
---
Also I think memes, artwork, etc should all be allowed but only under a "Fluff" flair.
---
The people who want it can see it, the people who don't, don't have to.
---
Arcane for poly?
---
I won't ever roll pve because there are times I goto lowbie areas and start problems. Couldn't give that up
---
why dont you tell them yourself?
---
This is no less silly than calling pve players carebears.
---
What the fuck is wrong with people.
---
Add flairs for memes and venting so people who don't want to see it can filter it
---
Not all that different from Org though and Org has the advantage of being more popular, especially with lockpickers.
---
Being a bigot would apply to rule 2, thus breaking the rules. The person you are obnoxiously replying to has a point and your childish retort just shows what type of mods this place has...
---
Yes, yes, I know you play a horde warrior, you made that very clear.
---
I'm just glad my guild, and almost every guild on my server, doesn't listen to your opinion on this matter.
---
4 of our rogues have perds already (rogues get prio on this item), and all our tanks have quel'serar cause they're not shitters.
---
&gt; It has been addressed by the Developer of the app yesterday. The cause was because they set the default sync to sync with everyone anytime someone dies. The other option was to sync with the guild, which limits the sync significantly. Apparently that is the new default on the newest version.
---
Exactly my point. I see plenty of good discussion in this thread.
---
Could create weekly threads  for different discussions and productive conversations.
---
i.e. Professions, Theorycrafting, Memes (non-repetitive), etc.
---
if this is too much for the current staff, get more mods!
---
Idk who's kid between the one playing the game and the other following him all day.
---
&gt; Not to get too philosophical, but online gaming has, I think, in the past few years especially, really exacerbated people's selfishness and narcissism.
---
I don't think anyone old enough to have experienced the evolution (or de-evolution) of online gaming from 2004 to 2019 would disagree with this. I've almost entirely quit playing online games, right now pretty much WoW and PUBG are the only online games I play anymore. Not for lack of time (I have quite an abundance for someone my age) nor skill (I'm not great but I do ok in most games) I just cannot stand online gaming communities anymore. It's a migraine in the making every single time. 99 out of 100 people you meet is either a selfish prick, a hyper-narcissist wannabe streamer or a tryhard troll that spends every ounce of energy making games annoying (Not talking ganking here, I mean more like the screwing with the game community, never shutting up type).
---
To each his own, my bank is full already with crafting materials, spare consumables, AH items, and various of items I only need in town. I know I can consolidate my bags, but often enough I am asked to Tank, DPS and/or Heal within the same group.
---
This made my day thank you.
---
Anytime my man. Anytime
---
I think there are pugs, and there are "semi-pugs/semi-guild runs".
---
And if you have the strong fundaments of a guild, then I wouldn't consider it a "pug".
---
Dude! I did subscribe! But this is not on YouTube... :&lt;
---
Shhh, I'll tell you a secret... I'm healer spec.
---
But seriously, while it is fun to save the group multiple times every run, I shouldn't have to HOJ a mob then off tank from the fully tapped lock because the lolBadRogue decided to attack the sheep, pulled agro, was almost one shot then vanished leaving poor little locky getting his head smacked, while still healing the tank whose dealing with the group that the lolLock and lolMage just oom'd from AOEing at 1/3 mana.
---
Use those little wands little dudes, you can do it!
---
You're right though, you keep doing you bruh.
---
The guilds killing it will be in all bis with r14 weapons and pieces. Aq40 will be cleared in either just under or just over an hour. Guilds on private servers with harder bosses and world buffs disabled still cleared aq40 on day one in 57 minutes
---
lol what?
---
Solo kills get you upwards of 250 honor, and you get 25% DR after each one per day.  You wouldn't get 5 honor unless you had *over* 40 people in your raid on a first kill.  20+ man is not "skirmish" groups.
---
You need to match whatever the opposite faction is doing.  If they are roaming in 3-5 mans, you should too. If they are walking to BRM in a 40 man, you should too.  Whatever the minimum amount is to counter the group, but roaming solo is *not* an efficient honor grind unless you're a horde rogue sitting in IF.
---
The odd thing I have noticed is if I've entered a DME and DMN and then reset instances I get two "dire maul has been reset" messages.
---
I have tanked my fair share.  I dont like mayhem of barely surviving each pull having to blow every cd and all mana users are drinking to full each time.  Theres gotta be a balance between safe and boring
---
i love reading all these gank squad complaint posts from the safety of my pve server. its like porn to me
---
I mean, you should have both, plus runes, then employ the thing that makes the most sense.
---
Can I get a few stacks of food and water please? :)
---
Food too?
---
I’m a lock I need food. 
---
Fine, thanks for the water.
---
I dunno if it's the same on other servers. But there is never a group looking for a healer. If I'm tank or dps I can find a group in minutes, but for some reason everyone always has a healer.
---
Addon's already been hotfixed bud
---
Not sure exactly about the gear, but from what I saw so far nothing really that great. Either way the point I was trying to make was you net the same, if not more honor from resource control. Honor degrades quickly the number of times you kill someone. Kill an enemy player once, maybe twice, then move on. This way you get 100-200+ honor a kill. Then you continue the search for herbs and ores and such. There will be enough alliance out questing and herbing for you to get tons of honor, believe me.
---
But Legion was amazing.
---
The fact that you are so toxic makes your idiocy that much more amusing.
---
It may be getting a little off topic but I think if a forum dedicated to discussing the game is being filled with complaints to the point that you feel the need to filter it out, maybe the developers should be taking action on it. 
---
Reddit obviously can't fix it but if you're going to put energy into something, seems like you'd want to put it into making the game healthier.
---
Please don't leave :'(
---
You can't just go by what amount things are selling for. Only sell what is profitable. Right now on my server Greater Fire Protection pots are in the 6.5G range each, but elemental fire sells for 6G. There is very little actual profit to be made. Same goes for the Free action Pots and Goblin Sapper charges. People are regularly selling them below component cost.
---
Greater Shadow and Nature pots are used by Hunters doing their Epic Bow quest, so the demand is still there, even though it may be low.
---
I'm all for this, but like others took the silly decision to roll pvp for my frienda who aren't active or near 60. Now i have a 55 lock I love with max professions etc but god I wish I had atleast rolled an alt on PVE, it just suits my game play.
---
You have 2 options in this scenario,you can either collect aggro and carry the morons which is what I recommend because it's the most efficient or you can use your authority as the only necessary group member to lay down the law. This doesn't necessarily mean you will get the dps kicked or whatever else you wanted,but it does mean you can find a new group before they can find a tank usually.
---
One, he didnt admit that it was his add-on causing it, apart from saying thanks for the report and then mentioning that he changed the syncing part. Yes I know reading is hard, apparently that's why you twisted the words of what he actually said?
---
OK, I'll get right on that for you.
---
Yeah a warrior into a decent mage is nigh unwinnable. With every encounter I just get more hopeless. I charge/fap so he can’t nova, he blinks. I start to run towards him while he’s casting poly at this point most likely cuz he noticed I fapped so my only option is to intercept to stop the poly cast OR do a juicy demonic rune/skull play OR grenade him so I can simply run at him, I’m finally on top of him and try and get a fear off - he ice blocks before I can until blink is back up, he blinks - I no longer have mobility and he runs in circles spamming arcane explosion/cone of cold/fire blast never having to even CAST an actual spell with a castbar. There’s not even a frostbolt to reflect 50% of the time and this is all without him popping a single LIP/rocket helm/trinket of any sort or grenade, yet I’ve used like 5 things :/
---
Immediately got Chucky vibes from the gnome when he pulled the knife.
---
Good to know
---
&gt; They got absurdly famous
---
But therein lies the difference, it's not the same because if the same happened today you'd probably never hear about it because it's so common now.
---
You are incredibly off base with this bizarre post, the “griefing” you describe is in fact an incentivized system implemented by the game designers. 
---
Your woefully small opinion of people is absolutely out of line with what even a cursory understanding of human psychobiology, or experience with P1 or classic would indicate. 
---
People are not savage animals rampaging around because they’re nihilist shitheads, it’s because they are being encouraged by the games design to take repetitive actions (designed as a time sink).
---
If you feral, you can solo the devilsaurs as bear without problem
---
This sub 2 years ago was about speculation on the game, whether phases would be released or if we would have a full content dump, class choice pros and cons, and other actual game discussion.
---
Now it is largely imgur links of chat logs with something "funny", a pic of someone hitting 60 in a way that they think is unique, and in general low effort content with the obvious goal of farming upvotes.
---
You encouraged this through a lack of moderation, most noticeably in the few months leading up to release. Granted your community grew exponentially and was likely harder to moderate, but I'm not in this thread to make excuses for the mod team.
---
Another one is the special hell designated for people who don't want to clear the room before fighting Ras Frostwhisper...
---
Where do I get Common Sense of Mechanics tho....is it BoP or can it be bought on the AH?
---
So...your not prot?
---
Let people do as they want to
---
What's wrong with r/wow ?
---
If honor was measured in the ratio to how many where fighting who it would be more accurate TBH, but lets be real Blizzard can't think of anything to improve a game, thats why they just scrap everything and generic-itize it all over 15 years XD
---
Cthun will be killed within 3 hrs of release

Flasks aren't overridden by buffs. 
---
Elixirs, yes. Flasks, no.
---
Yeah, maybe when I did it, it was bad luck, but I had maybe 4 spawns in the whole loop that was free from aggro.
---
Yeah this is just sad.
---
&gt;use your brains.
---
Same to you? You’re literally claiming this addon is breaking servers when several users including myself have proven this to be factually *untrue*.
---
Not just the chat servers, the entire zone was unplayable in Org with ~10s delay and 30s - 1 min just to zone in.
---
It goes far beyond the chat servers though zone chat was completely dead.
---
Thankfully you don't have to believe it the developer themselves admitted it and updated the add on yesterday. I don't use it but you're free to go check. I quoted them and provided the source.
---
You don't remotely need these consumes for MC/Ony. Acting like some elitist douchebag doesn't change that.
---
? Ok in my experience it has idk
---
Having played both sides, this is straight up not true; Horde have outright better quest progression and grouping. Best example of this is mid 40's for Alliance; Feralas is an unbelievably awful zone for them due to placement of Feathermoon, and they get about a third of the total quests Horde gets for Hinterlands. Compare that to how dense with quests both Revantusk and Camp Mojache are.
---
that's painful to look at
---
yea, i want to know this too.
---
A lot more people like it it than hate it though. That’s what’s made it popular.
---
Was 120 on horde at the begin of p2 now it went down to 100
---
No, it's been this way since launch, or at least I noticed it within a couple weeks after. It was not the behavior in vanilla.
---
&gt; I can definitively say I've attempted to reset an instance people are in, then zone back in (I was being careless and ignored the error message) before they exited... and it was the old instance.
---
I don't believe you.
---
Who trust this "census"?
---
Literary every Horde players on Faerlina who support the narrative that the server is not Horde dominated.
---
I use a wolf for raids only. The arcane resist is just for Shazzrah so it might not be worth the points.

Whining Wednesday
---
Anti-HK farm wpvp exists, and is often highly dynamic and forces a lot of pvp that would not have otherwise happened
---
Dude this is hilarious how do people.make these videos? Are you recording in game? Is there a separate program where you make movies with wow stuff? How the fuck do people make these?
---
idk if you want numbers, but i have farmed enough gold for my epic mount, and net 20k honor in 2 weeks doing what i do. i have less than 500 kills and ill be rank 6 tomorrow when honor resets. so.. you do the math?
---
Your train of logic is incoherent.
---
I'm sure everyone will immediately update the version and fix the problem.....
---
&gt;Is it at all feasible to push r11 without going apeshit crazy?
---
I really would not advise it. As someone who has gotten r13, r10 and r6 back in classic WoW.
---
With the PvP BG patch it is going to be all about ''who you know'' to get into the right premades. If you are playing on one of the bigger servers it is going to be infinitely harder. Whereas playing on a small casual PvE server would probably have something like r11 be pretty doable.

---
You didn't prove it to be untrue but I quoted the developer saying it is true.
---
Really? We were thinking of rolling there until launch day and hopped on incendius.  Really happy with our decision.
---
Well, they can always do nothing, which seems to be the current strategy.
---
Just such a shame that Blizz didn't have a system in place when people first created their characters, it would have solved a lot of the current issues.
---
Agreed, I just swap to my tier/pvp set for AOE if I even remember, good enough.
---
Whichever you think seems cool at the time you make your character
---
Classic will be the last wow I will ever play. Love everything about it. Except maybe the leveling atm :D
---
They didn't choose the easy mode not for nothing. They will be the 1st players to quit if their faction was not the dominated one.
---
Classic for the brave , retail for the filthy casual and winny litle weak kids...
---
For DEs you only need to get to 5.
---
Over 100 honor per kill on average, how many people do you group with?
---
Wait what? Don't you mean anything pve? Just because you're bad at pvp, don't mean it's unchallenging and boring.
---
Layering? What are you on?
---
Layers haven't been a thing since before p2 launched.
---
r/totalwar is one of my favorite/best done gaming reddits. I think you guys really need to rethink the megathreads. Specifically the daily questions megathread and the what should I play wednesdays. I also think there should be some type of pvp thread and videos thread.
---
Make a mage alt and aoe farm properly for gold
---
How is it a shitter deal? People who want stylus aren’t joining a stylus res scholo run
---
Your point is hyper-illogical, no one forced anyone to join a res group, and often the people joining wouldn’t roll on the res even if they could
---
I understand how traffic works you condescending asshole. No one said the addon was perfect. You are making false claims by saying everyone should DELETE HonorSpy because it is BREAKING every server. Fuck off.
---
WW axe is really outdated for 44 indeed. 
---
Tank dungeons, you are more than ready for it.
---
ZF straight to ST and Mara, farm mara for ring a bit, wait till 53-54 then live in BRD.
---
I main a tank but alright go ahead and make a comment full of 90% assumptions. Stopped reading about half way when I realized you are literally putting not just words but full paragraphs of words in my mouth. I genuinely feel bad for the people in your life that have to deal with your misplaced emotions. Get some help man, if not for you then for the people around you.
---
My claim is 100% true and confirmed by the dev as sourced in my OP.
---
It only makes sense to come here to bitch/whine or post memes. It's a 15-year old game, wtf is there to talk about? The majority are busy enjoying the game, chatting with guildies, and getting ready for AV/BWL.
---
What supporting evidence do you have for that? All the population sites I see have Skeram and Stalagg around 75/25 on top of the overwhelming anecdotal evidence of massive imbalance. What do you cite?
---
Wow, how pathetic.
---
yOu DoNt DeSeRvE tHaT rAiD sPoT - someone who doesn’t understand we can clear MC in 70 minutes without world buffs/consumes and a roster of 35 people
---
Warrior vs Rogue PVP question. 
---
As a warrior, its pretty obvious when a rogue is experienced/skilled at fighter against an arms warrior. They seem to know when how to get out at the right time, when to vanish, evasion etc...
---
Question - as a rogue fighting a warrior, what are things that warriors do that make it obvious that they are skilled or unskilled at fighting against rogues.
---
&gt;So you've seen two Rich Thorium veins at the same time on the minimap?
---
Yes, and I mined both. It was the node at the tree root and the one nearest to it, I scouted mid and the rest of SW before it and it was empty. The tree root one might fall under a separate sector along with the few western nodes.
---
&gt;There was talk of there being a 7min cooldown but I don't think that's the case.
---
This is definitely not true, I mined the same node in hearthglen twice in under 3minutes. After that though I didnt see a single new one for over 20minutes before I gave up.
---
Thats what I mean by random, I feel like theres either a limit on how many nodes can be mined in an area in X amount of time; or every time you mine a dice is rolled to determine when the next respawn is and the time can vary from a couple of minutes to god knows how long.
---
Its definitely a hard system to crack.
---
I understand that all of those items are infuriating. I dealt with many of those same issues as a Warlock back in classic.
---
I'm not coming at this from a perspective of not understanding what people are whining about, I'm coming at it from a perspective that these people have the ability to correct the problem and don't want to. 
---
As a warlock I decided I could only play when my best friend and brother were playing. Otherwise the game was largely infuriating just as you have outlined. 
---
We had a solid 3 person group - Warlock/Hunter/Warrior. We were all around level 40 when honor hit in vanilla and had to deal with a very hard time getting to 60. 
---
As a 3 man group the game was an absolute blast. PvP was still infuriating at times, but we adapted and quested in EPL even with ganks happening multiple times in an hour. 
---
That period of time is what made me want to play on a PvP server again. I've suggested it before but people don't like hearing that grouping to just quest is a good idea. Its like people grouped for level 1-20 and then decided they didn't want to group anymore. 
---
If you aren't leveling and are instead trying to farm at level 60 right now the situation is far more difficult. My brother had herb/alchemy and I had tailoring/skinning back in vanilla. We farmed together quite efficiently at 60.
---
I agree that faction imbalance is an issue. Being on a server that is close to 50/50 makes it more difficult for me to relate to your final statement saying Horde are camping everywhere. When I login you can basically ask what areas are Horde controlled or Alliance controlled and select the zone you visit based on that information.
---
Just curious about what OP is looking for. Guides are already out there for everything, and wowhead covers items. What else could the community talk about that isnt information that isnt already being posted?
---
Nobody was told they'd be playing on 200% population servers. Blizzard said those realms may experience queues, which most realms don't have today despite being overpopulated. Do you understand the difference?
---
My spreadsheet shows it’s a roughly 3% DPS increase.
---
Ban memes. For the love of god please ban the memes.
---
No, skill cap is 5/level. You can't max 300 'til you hit 60.
---
I have had to run into ally controlled BRM on raid days, it’s not incessantly, it’s just a handful of corpse runs.
---
Yeah this how I make my gold.  We take a miner, herblist, enchanter.  We split all the herbs, ore, shared and books.  We did get a forors last night.  Lucky me.
---
How would you like to be Ziip? The lone alliance in the gank fest of STV? F
---
The games been out for 15 years. Not much speculation you can do at this point.
---
Then how come you have been incapable of making a counter argument, and have just resorted to ad hominem attacks?
---
Also skipping packs is one of the hight cause of wipes in dungeons. In pugs I take extra time topull questionable or tight packks that I would normally trust my guild or friends to skip. I always mark kill target and CC targets and have a macro at the start of every group that says what each marker means. Tanking is more than just getting hit and controlling agro, it's really setting the pace and rythym of the group and taking a leadership role in that groups success.
---
That’s really sad that you get amusement from moving pixels around on a video game. I get you’re easily amused and don’t find the value in doing things yourself. Why not just go outside and take up professions, fish, craft, join groups of people with common interests, and achieve real goals?
---
Oh let me guess, the way you get your entertainment is somehow better than the people who watch streamers.
---
This sub is a couple years older than Classic
---
I think a lot of these people arguing just don't agree on what a "pug" is. When we were doing AQ/Nax in actual vanilla we did BWL on off nights and would often pick up friends, alts and people from other guilds to clear it and roll on gear. I really can't imagine trying to form up a full 40 in trade chat and being successful tho, which is what a lot of these people seem to think a pug has to be.
---
Then he wouldn’t get all the attention silly
---
Going through like life this, assuming everyone is a moron, has helped me alot.
---
You can definitely run two soul bags.  I don't believe there's any limit on special bags.
---
❄️❄️❄️
---
Yeah, the level requirement is specific for alchemy if you want the free gold from transmutes every 48 hours.
---
I'm a rogue, so the post doesn't even apply to me. I am just trying to outline why DK's on players is a very bad idea.
---
“Man it’s such a shame people back in 2005 did not forsee the issue when the game would be rereleased 15 years later after a bunch of min/maxing came out” that’s literally what you sound like. 
---
I understand there are many issues, and there are currently not many good solutions out there. But some of the recommendations people bring up really makes you question whether they are brain dead and just repeating things they see others are saying. Without thinking for themselves how their “solution” can actually be implemented
---
Add /r/games style corrections when a post is proven wrong.
---
I have played since day 1 with zero lag in every single zone at every time of day with thousands of players using the addon on my server. Zero lag. 
---
Proven. 
---
Again, your claims are wrong. I am happy to continue drilling this down your throat as long as you like.
---
So all of your skills that go based on damage ie 150% weapon dmg get a much larger boost from slower speed weapons. So fast weapons are a big drop for damage from skills.
---
&gt; Hopefuly, we won't need any throttling anymore, as the data will not be multiplied as many times as it was in one server-wide channel. It is now only synced across guildies. We just need to wait for players to update the addon.
---
How else are you interpreting this direct response to being told that the addon is causing upwards of 1Mbps data usage per person?
---
You guys are a fucking joke. You insist on being wrong up until the moment that everyone else tells you you're wrong, then it's "how could anyone have predicted this?!!?"
---
I'm telling you, plainly now, Honor Spy is causing these lag issues. Telling people to update a broken addon won't work.
---
not as far as i know. your server’s discord might have stuff.
---
They haven't done what?
---
There are GMs and raid leaders who actually think this way. They also keep an eye on everyones warcraftlogs parses to find out who isn't carrying their own weight.
---
Just use Innervate and tell the Priest to go fuck himself.
---
Stockpile fire/shadow until BWL, stockpile nature until AQ40, stockpile frost until Naxx.  
---
If you plan to play for this entire duration, this is the best way to make the most money off of protection potions. You can also sell many other non-protection potions along the way to make up for it.
---
In the same ways, a warlock can avoid shattet damage while still offensively dispelling with felhunter, a mage can remove crippling poison or a frost nova without blowing blink, etc...
---
My question would be why either, unless you're flush with cash - go do the questline for Mirah's Song.
---
In all honesty i dont even look anymore its just horde? Dead. I dont care what level you are im going to attack you. Honor or not i just wanna kill you at this point. Ive lost too much time to this bullshit. Too many members waiting on groups to get inside an instance. 1 hour to get inside and another hour to refill a spot and wait on that toon to make it inside too. Its a waste of time. 2.3.or 4 peopke inside and ill begin pulling. I have made it throughwhole instances without the full party even being assembled. It sucks but itswhat you have to do now just to be able toplay.
---
The biggest incentive would be faction queues that forced a relatively even ratio at all times, regardless of actual server pop.  If you can't even log on to play because your faction is so massive, you'll switch.  Entire guilds would switch.
---
They just sheep/mc/slow/stun/trap you until it falls off. I understand the theory, but if they have a priest and you use this method, they're going to run you backwards even farther while you're MCed so you're actually making backwards progress by trying to use this.
---
Blizzard was out of touch with reality. 
---
First, they started with 33 servers, worldwide, expecting that Classic will have a measly number of players. We ended up with 4 times more servers.
---
Secondly, they expected a 90% drop-off before Phase 2, so they started all servers with 6-7 layers, each with more than Vanilla cap, probably around 4k concurrent players per layer. We ended up with a much less drop-off before layering was removed (around 30%), and most servers had 2-3 layers worth of players  ( 8 to 12k concurrent players), with the biggest ones having 4 layers (15-16k concurrent).
---
Blizzard messed up, big time. And this is because they were living in la-la land, assuming that Classic will be a niche game, and that most players will quit because lack of QoLs.
---
What Blizzard should have done, and what the "crazy" people told them way before Classic launch, was to count for 4-5 million players at launch, with a 50% max drop-off before Phase 2. This was crystal clear that it will happen. And it did happen.
---
Problem is that Blizzard would be forced to launch at least 250 servers for Classic, and that would look REALLY BAD for their favorite child, Retail WoW.
---
250 Classic servers, full of players, vs 450 servers of Retail, most empty. Not a good image for Blizzard.
---
But, anyway, Blizzard fucked up. They were off by 400% in estimating the number of players, and 200% off in estimating the drop-off rate before P2, which is an 800% composite error in their "estimations".
---
And we can clearly see this on faction balance.
---
In Vanilla, a 60-40 faction split was considered balanced...simply because with 3k concurrent players, the dominant faction would have 1,800 players, and the other faction, 1,200. A measly 600 players advantage, split on 50 zones : 12 players advantage per zone.
---
In Classic, when P2 hit (not today), a 60-40 split on a 10-12k player server (and most servers had this when layering was removed), means that the dominant faction would have 6k-7.2k players, and the other faction 4k-4.8k players.
---
The dominant faction have between 2k and 2.4k player advantage.Spread to 50 zones, that is an advantage of 40 to  48 player per zone.
---
No wonder that every single lvl 50+ dungeon entrance, raids, and the paths to those dungeons and raids is camped by the dominant faction...there are TOO MANY PLAYERS. And except a 50-50 split, which doesn't exists in reality, the dominant faction would simply destroy the other faction, with sheer numbers.
---
In Vanilla, an organized group of 15 pvpers would demolish a group of 40 unorganized players. In Classic, the same group of 15 would face 100+. Even unorganized, those 100+ would win, hands down, because of numbers.
---
So, yeah...Blizzard fucked up, willingly or not. Doesn't matter. They fucked it up.
---
"I remember." Everything has been easier in classic than people remember. Everything.
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Taking action against the things people complain about got us to where retail is now
---
I'm sorry but the whole point of the PVE /PVP server divide was to ensure that people who just want to do the things you list, could do them without interruption should they so desire.
---
I've played on PVE servers, in fact my first ever char was on Stormrage US at launch, the experience you crave is quite handily delivered by a PVE server.  
---
Now it wasn't for me which is why I rerolled on a PVP server so I could experience the large scale PVP which tends to be inspired by not being able to easily do the things you list without having to make a fight of it. Maybe that wasn't the experience on your lower pop server but I can tell you it was exactly like this where I was.   
---
Moreover the experience of private server players more recently who discussed exactly what this would be like...ad nausum...mainly because many of them love large group world PVP might have given you some insight into what a PVP server would be like during this phase...so no I don't feel like I'm being condescending when I tell you that if you considered which server you wanted to roll on the PVP server was obviously NOT the experience you desired.   
---
That this has belatedly become apparent to you is disappointing but many of us actually enjoy the game as it is.
---
How do you argue against somebody who says "rjrjqwhrjrj kdjndjwjejfbsnwjwi"?
---
Can you tell me the pros and cons of having 4 SM/Ruin Warlocks vs 2 SM/Ruin and 2 DM/Ruin given available debuff slots?
---
This might be a lofty comparison, but Chess is thousands of years old and has discussion boards.
---
Never expect a tip. Be happy when it's there.
---
Those consumes aren't the difference....
---
Hahaha well done dude !
---
All you've proven is you don't understand networking.
---
Yep thats what i always also though , special dmg bonus usualy is higher than regular spellpower . Therefore of wraith is stronger than +spelldmg because it usualy has more of it
---
Price has gone up, significantly on two herbs and overall up on a few more that I farm.
---
And they were dead wrong.
---
&gt; Nope, private servers had up to 3x larger concurrent cap than the current cap, and they worked completly fine.
---
Worked completely fine? Those servers were broken at a fundamental level because of the ridiculous population.
---
I get what you’re saying and it makes all the sense in the world but like American politics some people just hate the other side and want to watch the world burn... logic doesn’t work on those people and they just want to gank and kill anyone that passes by. That will never stop, just hope with BGs coming, I can get into BRM without dying 20 times.
---
I like this idea alot
---
God I feel bad for all my alliance friends I left on the pvp realm. 3 out of 5 already quit and 2 are trying their best to get 60 but stuck at 53 atm because of campers. Come to pve realms if you want to play the game again &lt;3
---
People make mistakes all the time and the important part is that they made an effort to fix their mistake. The addon developers are no more or less guilty than the people who used it.
---
Just take a deep breath and find a better use of your time.
---
Actually Classic has shown me that much of the new stuff they’ve come out with is just gimmicks and it’s the core gameplay that people enjoy. 
---
I haven’t played an expansion at launch since Cataclysm (they destroyed resto Druids) after starting at the beginning of TBC and Classic only makes me want to play more Classic, it doesn’t make me want to play retail. At all.
---
This discussion could've been its own post, I agree. It wasn't though. This post provoked the thought from the mod. That's why its here.
---
he’s just trying to help mate
---
The developer didn’t admit anything. Your twisting his words just like a damn journalist.
---
Disregard the OP. Players have a voice and they want to talk about this.
---
Anyone have a recap of what happened recently?
---
I'm obviously talking about getting honor from lvl48-59 when you're 60. What bad unintended side effect it would have to remove that rule? 
---
And yes people ignored World PvP objectives like EPL but the reasons are obvious: it came too late and granted less honor than BG. It's not rocket science isn't it?
---
But I feel you have the notion that Vanilla is some kind of perfectly balanced things that any change would destroy or make worse when it's just a happy mess of things that devs rushed, things they didn't expect, and things they corrected on the fly. One thing is clear: phase 2 was a total disaster because there was no changes.
---
Why is the video not on youyube ? I tried watching it but on reddit it's either 240p or buffer every 3s
---
No image posts.  Works pretty good for the lol sub and others top prevent it being nothing but 0 effort images.
---
&gt;does. There's wPvP going on every day on my server, but it's entirely contained within hillsbrad, doesn't affect the lowbies (unless they choose to flag), and is still lots of fun.
---
&gt;That being said
---
It's not up to you, the userbase needs to be more responsible about upvoting the things they want to see, and ignoring the things they don't.
---
People need to spend more time sorting threads by new than camping out the main page.
---
Don’t need to see 100 post crying about wrong choices about rolling on servers.
---
I'd recommend you do, and get used to keeping it filled.  You'll be more useful to yourself and others if you do. 
---
Getting 24 slots for ~50-70G in mats is well worth it for an endgame warlock.  It's way better than an Oxynia bag, and even with several of them you end up with more total bag space.
---
It looks like daily questions threads and green pinned discussion threads actually take away from the subreddit. Because then instead of having a community asking questions and discussing on the subreddit, you have two threads where discussion is taking place and then the whole rest of the subreddit posts are all the garbage content that people complain about. If it were me, I would make a daily meme thread, and let the question posts and discussion posts be the meat of the actual subreddit posts.
---
And fights of angels sing thee to thy rest
---
The source I linked has tests that confirmed the data usage was from honorspy.
---
Just stop guys. Read before you post.
---
&gt; Classic is not polarizing at all.
---
It is though, we can agree to disagree thats fine. The fact is that there are a sizable amount of players who enjoy the game but hate many aspects of it, hence the list above.
---
I doubt Classic+ were to ever be released, but if Blizzard were to lift the nochanges "clause" a lot of things like respec costs, dungeon finder, gathering node frequency, arenas, honor system would be revisited.
---
One of my favorite/imo best done gaming subreddits is r/totalwar. I'm not sure what there is to learn there but just imo. 
---
I do think off the bat they need to rethink the megathreads. Do we still need What Should I Play Wednesday theads 3 months past release? Why isn't there some type of pvp thread? I think pvp is where classic really shines over retail and where there's still room for theorycrafting/learning. I think having a daily megaquestion thread devalues the thread and it makes me nervous to ask questions in it - am I posting at the right time to get answers/how many people will be viewing? 
---
I think they need to figure out a way to properly remove quasi reposts: Mounts/Just Downed Rag/Look At This Epic Loot Roll Coincidence. 
---
And Honestly one of my top please don't let this turn into r/wow suggestions: Please don't ever allow the shallow "look at this drawing of my character (so&amp;so) did" - clearly advertising for their patron. "Look at this cake/tattoo/plushi I/my gf got!" 
---
I think there should be better posting of videos/clips. I don't understand some of the hate twitch streamers universally get. Like people will slam Apes/Progress/Etc but they honestly put out fun/thoughtful/cool/successful videos that I've learned a lot from. And I remember during the apex of WoW - End of Vanilla through WOTLK - it was the pvp movies that really pushed this game to new and higher subscribers(obviously just imo).
---
You're horde. alliance hit contested zones around level 16.
---
If they weren't going to update the addon before, they're not any more likely to update it because some rager shouts at random strangers in the new queue of a board where people post memes and phone pics of their screens.
---
So your only response is repeatedly dropping ad hominems and down voting? Right. Surely my argument is the problem here.
---
The dedicated bags are always cheaper and more readily available throughout the game.  
---
Soul puch is 20 slots and you can buy one in your 30s or 40s no problem considering you have no mount to save for, and you won't get a shot at an 18 slot bag realistically until late game, and they're still harder to come by (ony drop) or afford (bottomless).
---
I feel bad for you, having that guy standing behind you with a gun pointed at your head and making you farm for honor. 
---
Should we call the police, or are you doing ok?
---
Attitudes like yours are going to kill your server, but I could care less since I refuse to let dipshits like you tell me I “owe” them something for my subscription fee, and rolled PvE.
---
Phase 2 has been awesome for us. Woot.
---
It really wasn’t.
---
Sorry, i meant "rudimentary threat meter", not sure how I missed that.
---
Healbot does mouseover shift/ctrl/alt modifiers as well.
---
I think that most of the healcomm add-ins just auto-calculate based on logs, and don't require other users to have the add-in.
---
It's the same thing.  Everyone's 1h elixir lasts the whole 1h and they only need one.  If you are wiping and popping a new one each time, you burn through them much faster.
---
Not to mention the 30 dreamfoil/gromsblood per flask that are currently not being used.  I'm thinking to make another bank alt just to hold these herbs.
---
Yep, I’ve been using that one recently too.  Though at times I still open a page without thinking about it from wowhead and don’t realize it until my PC starts bogging down.

How is it not good enough? It´s BiS. if u dont have the gold or the luck of  a drop then the save the princess in brd is equal (but u can only have one of those).
---
unliky what many guides say, freezing band is NOT bis for pve (i rather have the 7 intel than +4 spell dmg diference from the freezing band)
---
Ring of spell power is much better but with the amount of casters in any given raid...well...good luck gettin it fast enough.
---
I have 2 maindens circle, that cost me 300g and 350g respectively. Best money i spent lately. As a  mage, gettin gold is rly not a issue tho.
---
BUT, its only a opinion ofc.
---
Link your parses right now if you aren't a shitter. Let's see how good your guild really is :). I bet your tanks are fucking god awful apes that can't do their rotation at all, but it doesnt matter because alliance tanking is easy as shit. 
---
Threat doesn't matter on alliance side at all until you are trying to speed up BWL clears. So I agree that most average guilds wouldn't give daggers to their tanks on alliance side. 
---
Of course on alliance side all you need for tanking til you have farmed BWL is quel serrar. Horde side you don't get free 5 weapon skill on quel and it just is not as good at all.
---
It's the most successful RTS game ever made. Just because you are bad at it doesn't mean it's shit you mongoloid.
---
that made me laugh. thanks.
---
as if lock would waste precious GCD on siphon life or drain life.
---
Not possible. It's the community here.
---
Very unknowledgeable, casual, unskilled people (who simultaneously dont think they are)
---
If you actually want to find tips, tricks, guides, and new knowledge about the game, nothing's changing the fact no one posts or even has the knowledge in this community to post it.
---
I like the useful tips and info. I also like the classic specific memes! I disagree sir. 
---
A flair maybe, but id vote against an outright ban. To me it shows a passionate fan base.
---
yes
---
Its always the skull level cat druid that saves the day when someone is getting ganked.
---
Ban low effort memes, or memes in general.
---
&gt; Institute a "Gripe" post flair (and enforce it) so we can filter out all the whining.

My god man there wont be anything left if you filter like that!
---
Auto forward gank squad/server imbalance posts to the official blizzard Twitter account.

Flair them so sub users can skip.

Job done.

press frostbolt harder?
---
I'm using a hybrid combat/assassination backstab build.
---
For fighting mobs the opener basically goes like this for me:
---
Cheap shot &gt; Backstab &gt; Gouge &gt; Pool &gt; Backstab &gt; Pool until about 80ish Energy &gt; Kidney shot &gt; Backstab &gt; Backstab. 
---
Most stuff dies before you can finish this combo unless its elite. 
---
Get improved gouge, the 1.5 extra seconds is often enough time for that extra energy tick.
---
Needs more consigned artwork and tattoos
---
Make a sticky thread where everyone can whine freely about wpvp and delete every other thread.

Actually remove low effort posts.  I don't care if they wrote 10 paragraphs on why pvp is bad, remove it.

Quick look at the post history makes it real easy to disagree with you. Go back to your the_donald safe space.

Cool story. Not sure how this helps me in any way.

Have you ever browsed this subreddit before?
---
This sub has done that for 2 years now, at least it is about the game.
---
By clicking login you consent to PVP on a pvp server.
---
Don't expect people to play the game the way you want them to.
---
Just two! But I only plan on raiding through BWL. I don’t have time to do the AQ and Naxx grind this time around, unless they’re way easier than I remember them being and can be done with progression in one night a week.
---
Around 700 worldwide.
---
This is good ! Thanks
---
Type ‘*your class* discord classic wow’ on Google. I don’t know about every class but warriors have two discords where one enables casual discussion (and has a lot of wrong answers as a result), and another actively shames noobs that say anything wrong (and has been very useful to me). Be on the look out for the former.
---
This subreddit is extremely casual if not outright noobish.
---
Lmao
---
I believe that when you give people accurate information they can make informed decisions.
---
So... literally don't play the game if you're a casual player? That's your suggestion?
---
Spells that can partial resist resist get partial resists more often for the same net effect on dps.
---
No one gives a shit.. just unsub. No need to announce it to the world
---
Advice, learning, helping, clarification, creative builds, explaining BiS for new people! (doesn't always mean wear this &gt; that)

This is awesome I love how all the mechanics are recognizable but you do such totally uncanny shit with em haha well done!
---
He means during the lead up to p2, all the black lotus were farmed on every layer, so there are shit loads sitting around already.
---
Level 44 is more than halfway. 45-60 is the home stretch!
---
When it comes to tanking... the only one that comes to mind would be heroic strike. But that isn't being using all that often. Do I have that wrong? Are there others that get used often that would be impacted by the slower speeds?
---
Enjoy your little rant of a thread. Normal people aren’t having any issues with this addon. You’re still wrong, by the way. LOL.

---
The problem with faction is that if implemented on unbalanced servers, it will single handely choke the server to death itself.
---
Lets say you have 80/20 server, and now you add that system. Now 3/4 of the horde population won't be able to log in, period. They will be stuck in queue literally forever unless they log in at absurd times and never log out.
---
Greater is below superior no?
---
Invis pots! Time is money friend.
---
They could have just realised honor system with bgs, that would have softened the blow, because everyone gunning for ranks only have ganking as a tool for that
---
1.12, that's when they introduced battlegroups. Which is a good thing.
---
You're legitimately clueless.  The populations on servers right now are significantly higher than we had in Vanilla.
---
I'm playing on Earthfury, a fairly middling server population-wise.  I played on Blackrock and Frostwolf during Vanilla, which were two of the most populous servers at the time.  EF is waaaaay busier than either of those servers were.
---
I can only imagine what it's like now on Herod, etc.  I started on Herod originally before transferring to EF - as buy as EF is now, Herod still shits all over it in terms of the sheer insanity in the number of players.
---
So yeah, you're wrong.  And you're indisputably wrong, since it's been confirmed the server caps are way higher now than they were in vanilla.
---
Nice try but the golden god was a 5 Star MAN
---
You look more like Antonio
---
warriors are better at grinding barely green or -2 yellow mobs than questing vs equal or higher level mobs.  You do overwhelmingly better against lower level enemies.  Don't quest at equal level, grind on something easier.  Check small flame sacs on the AH and grind the 41-43 dragon whelps in eastern badlands if they're good.  kill the woodpaw mystics and woodpaw reavers in feralas for a few levels if you don't like the whelps.  If you absolutely must quest, aim for green lower level stuff unless you come into something unusual concerning gear or weapons.  Make sure you have plate that isn't 40 shit tier plate — armor value is good for leveling, and Strength is overwhelmingly good.
---
I didn’t expect potion usage to go up. I expected herb farming to go down because of the pvp. Which it has not. No herbs have changed in price.
---
I guess I'm not really sure what your point is other than to be contrarian and say "well actually, since any post can have valuable discussions it doesn't make sense for mods to delete things based on their content".
---
That's just a stupid argument to have. It's literally what a mod does, delete low effort posts, remove content flagged/reported by it's userbase. 
---
If OPs post whining without offering anything of value doesn't meet your threshold for "low effort" content then should be removed.. then we'll just have to agree to disagree. 
---
Personally, I think the dozens of daily posts like his are the biggest problem in this subreddit right now. It's full of toxic complainers that don't offer anything of value. Not sure if it's just gaming subs or what, but I don't really notice it nearly as bad on other subs I'm a member of, including gaming ones.
---
No more low effort screen grab “memes”.
---
Now it's useless complaints about useless complaints
---
&gt;Nobody was told
---
Blizzard mentioned they will increase single layer cap though. However, "the goal just a few weeks into launch, as we go to phase two, of having all layers stable and having a single layer for each realm as the end state." + "Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds."
---
&gt;Blizzard said those realms may experience queues, which most realms don't have today despite being overpopulated
---
The fact they don't have any queues means they aren't overpopulated though. If they are too populated to your liking, transfer out or reroll.
---
Yeah, they pushed up BG's to release on 12/10 in 8 days instead of ~2 months from now.
---
Someone told me you can't do naxx trash farm solo for sure you need like 5 people, is that true?
---
Most people probably don't bother binding it or are not used to using them.
---
Just fel like HS is a waste of time. Even with the threat. Fela like a waste instead of auto attack and sundering.
---
3 main reasons.
---
1)Tanks are hurried by DPS. Not flying through mobs generally warrants a “BaD TAnK” label. 
---
2) Some tanks ARE actually inexperienced / new. This will be evident usually from they themselves saying “Hi guys, Newtank99 here, I’m new please mark X and I’ll follow” or them getting lost Etc. You can’t really hide inexperience as a tank. 
---
3) Bad healers with poor mana management. Now I’m not saying this is you OP, and I’ll repeat, THIS IS NOT A ATTACK, DISS, STAB, or any other comment on [YOU]. Some healers need to realize their main role is to keep the group alive, not topping off HP bars like some hyper waiter who’s gunning for employee-of-the-century.
---
If you see them switch weapons after their opener (to their one with a chain) you know you're in for trouble
---
Also if they shield up it often means they have backup coming and are just trying to run out the clock.
---
Get a hobby dude
---
It's not almost as good and they don't stack
---
Roll PvE I guess
---
Ban all weebs. No weeb posts and weird wow anime art pls
---
The buffs appear in the buff window, but if you pull up your character window, you will see that your agility doesn't go up when you try to stack. It's a bug.
---
That the add-on is sending more data than it has to be, and that he hopefully won't have to throttle it more than necessary.          
---
I stand by the whole if the add-on was causing issues because of the data being sent, it would've been changed by Blizzard further limiting the API weeks ago. But also because I haven't had issues with chat playing on the second largest (or I guess equally large cause queues) NA server, while playing primetime.          
---
Most importantly I have more faith in blizzard devs, rather than people on Reddit that recently pulled out pitchforks about honor spy being the culprit lol. It'd be a yikes if it was the issue all along, and blizzard didn't change the API, or the limit an add-on can post to chat after ~3 weeks of this being a problem on some servers
---
No he is wrong. Casting heal instead of greater heal is not downranking at all, it is as you said, just using the correct spell.
---
You are also completely correct that you really only start downranking when you have good gear with a lot of +healing.
---
Don't forget the insane elitism and gatekeeping!
---
Who were these Alliance? Asking for a friend.
---
It's not that it isn't good enough, it's that it isn't good enough of an upgrade to justify the price. Cyclopean Band will do me just fine until I get a ring from raiding. There are several available rings with spell crit that are decent as well and fairly easily obtainable.
---
I, too, love crack pot conspiracy theories.
---
The victory is they're not just wasting your time, now you can waste their time as well. 
---
It's a lose, lose. But that's politics.
---
So I’m curious... So what would you have them do to fix your problem? Besides acknowledge that pvp is happening on a pvp server?
---
I want classic + personally, because TBC is trash, and I think there is still a lot of potential in vanilla after nax.
---
It would be cool to see some new unexplored content within the vanilla philosophy, as oppose to roflstomping and min-maxing TBC as well from day 1.
---
So you can spend 2.9 hours clearing it instead?
---
The prep time required for your guild to get this benefit VASTLY exceeds the time you save.
---
I would not call it fine (oh wait I forgot this subreddit is filled with alliance players with no perspective)
---
I rolled horde on one of the more recent pservers and the alliance honor farming us in the 50+ zones was so bad I quit the game
---
Have you considered reading the whole post? Try it, it's fun!
---
Lol you want them to publicly say “get over it”?
---
This is how the game works. Just because people complain doesn’t mean it has to get changed or even talked about. 
---
Wouldn’t you be more upset if blizzard came out and said “well don’t roll on pvp server if you don’t want to pvp”?
---
Using "Heal" instead of "Greater Heal" is not downranking, quit being dumb
---
It's a quest chain that typically takes people 15 years to complete.
---
I was hoping he would rip the undead's arm off and start chasing him with it
---
I went to westfall, join us.
---
"Bigot" lol...   
---
you ask for advice to make the sub better, then you shit on the advice... and that is why this is just another wow sub with mods who probably play retail all day and don't understand classic.
---
this being true, If for some reason your bank has a mount, TB is awesome as you don't need to dismount for AH
---
&gt; Every german pvp server is dead. 
---
I am sorry, but they are are all either Full, or High.
---
Ahh it was so poorly spelled I couldn’t make that connection.
---
Not all my pvp is purely solo, entrapment is important for holding down groups in choke points. Something like 0/24/27 would be good for a lone hunter
---
Rogues are my favorite.  Getting into higher level dungeons like BRD, rogue opens with big ambush and backstab and gets instantly critted to 1/2 health "dude why can't you hold aggro".
---
Your instant 2100 damage cannot compete with damage-less sunder and 30 damage revenge.  Use feint.
---
"ohhhh shit I forgot about feint ok good idea"
---
&gt;It is 6k now because, guess what...fuckloads of people quit, because WPvP was introduced in a world designed for 3k players max, not 10-12k.
---
Yes but private servers proved that it works perfectly fine, if not better with massive populations.
---
There is a reason why they allowed such huge caps, as oppose to splitting into multiple 3k ghosttown servers.
---
I’ve done this on a mage before and it was pretty quick with all the aoe, how does a rogue do this?
---
We have a paladin tank in our guild and he's getting pretty good, finally at the point he's useful in MC and in dungeons he's pretty locked down.
---
He's also starting to chain pull. The only difference is he stops to drink after every 4th pull or so vs every 6th pull. Just cast the mana judgement on one of the last mobs youll kill, don't worry about the first marked mob because dps can handle it, and you'll be fine.
---
Except it's indeed 3k for most servers and 6-7k for streamer server or those they have actually warned everyone to transfer from. So yeah, they haven't failed.
---
You literally came to this post to whine about the joke.
---
If anybody should leave ppl alone it's you mate.
---
Mainly the opportunity cost of having tons of gold tied up in investments that won't pay off for 6+ months.
---
How do you all keep forgetting humans will ALWAYS maximize reward no matter how ridiculous you personally think it is?
---
The dominant faction will que at their battle masters, and immediately attain ports/summons to hunt levelling people in the open world...You're against your own faction in the Honor war, not the opposing. Simply put, in a race to the top, the ones with long ques that enter the open world will win over sole BG ques.
---
Even though Blizzard is employing cross realm, statistically speaking horde generally has more players, and therefore longer ques. It's far too hard to tell up front, but I'd lay my money that horde will have ques longer than alliance.
---
On Skeram this means even less alliance gank squads in the open world because their ques are quick and getting a port into the open world is meaningless because there's limited to no downtime.
---
It's going to be worse in the open world for non dominant factions. The sole exception might be horde minority faction servers depending on how they split crossrealm..
---
Tldr: It will get worse before it gets better
---
My thoughts on this is that it is a pretty tool bag move in general.  You are taking a spot of someone who would actually, at least in theory, be trying to help the team win.  So you are in effect leaching off of them and why?  It’s too hard for you to figure out how to level on your own?  Give me a break.
---
Literally anything else that pertains to the game. No one cares that your dumb ass rolled a pvp server and are now regretting it.
---
As a "pvper" if you can call it that, I would gank you more times to make sure I get my share of honor rather than just let you pass. I usually let people pass after 2-3 kills.. that is worth honor.
---
I’m sitting on 55 that I bought when they were 15-20g saving them for my personal use.
---
Alliance fighting? This sub lied to me
---
It obviously depends on the kind of PVP you want to excel at - and the effort you want to put in.
---
If you're looking to win world PvP encounters, skill, gadgets, and just being ready for the encounter is going to win you way more fights than gear is. 
---
If you're looking to duel against top tier players, every little bit helps I guess. 
---
For BG PvP, chances are you'll mostly be in a premade stomping a pug, in a premade Vs premade situation I guess it could start coming down to gear assuming similar skill and strategy levels. 
---
Overall though, I'd say that if you rank up to 10 and grind all the BG reps to exalted, you'd have some very competitive gear, even in comparison to people that raid BWL. You won't be as geared as someone in full BWL BIS, but that's not very common to have among raiders. If you're the type that's going to get rank 14, you'll be better geared than all but the luckiest raiders at BWL level. 
---
At the raid tiers of AQ40 and Naxx, I guess people start getting some seriously good gear, but that's arguably also when raids start being pretty challenging.
---
Your reading comprehension is trash. Asking what the official response is from Blizzard is not complaining about people complaining. It's quite literally asking if there has been an official statement addressing it.
---
I would highly recommend getting a level 60 mage to run as dps on your ZF runs, they will vaporize the packs and you dont really have to change your playstyle around them being there. I was personally getting 80k/hr+ doing it this way. It's a lot of fun too.
---
Thank you! This was the clarification I was looking for
---
I appreciate your hands-on interest, and wish the best to you and your team. This used to be my most frequented sub and hope, in the future, that it may be once again.
---
Private server did that, and they were able to self-balance without devs interfering at all.
---
And if I want to play on a vanilla PvP server ( I actually knew what that means before playing on classic) I wouldn't pcik a 80/20 or whatever dogshit server ratio, because then I might as well have picked a PvE server.
---
No, I would have found a 45/55 ish server and joined the smaller faction. But I can only speak for myself, and the miracle that has been observed on private servers.
---
You're goddamn right.
---
For some reason read it as Major.
---
Why the attitude? People already refuted your opinion. Having them read garbage twice doesn't make it stink any less. Blocked as your responses indicate what type of person you are.
---
I remember going through a stupid amount of shadow pots on cthun progression
---
Better than not having a raid slot at all. Other guilds hand [Nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) to hunters and warriors for better uptime and not having to sacrifice a debuff slot to Stormstrike.
---
People will never self-regulate. Regulation implies sacrificing personal gain for the community as a whole, this will never happen except in small tightly knit groups.
---
3k is the current average concurrent online on a server though. Anything over it is a server with free transfer available at some point and definitely some warnings issued by Blizzard. You haven't transferred out? Your fault, you had it coming.
---
&gt;Also I wonder how much rage this will cause in AV from lvl 60's trying to rush it.
---
Who cares about them? Your purpose for being there isn't for their benefit.
---
Quitting the game because one of its social platforms is toxic and full of whiny little cocks such as yourself? Yeah ok m8
---
For my horde DBZ fans, ya know how Freeza keeps dying and coming back? It cuz he’s an undead!
---
This is all to help you remember that the goblin Freeza stands by the UC zip in Org
---
i dont know what class u play m8, but as a mage in this raid content, frostball is all aboout that spell dmg rather than crit.
---
with 2 rings giving 36 spell dmg plus 14 intel, i would say theres nothing out there besides ring of spell power that can ramp up ur frostballs raw output
---
Revenge of the Carebears. Most hilarious thing is we can still PVP daily in Hillsbrad and once BGs release, we'll have PVE epics farmed while the PVP tough guys are still corpse running to BRD for their pre-raid BiS.
---
Sadly the system makes the worst scum of earth surface on both sides. I am getting camped the same way, except by Horde xD.
---
It's not though. It's all about conflict points. Big places for fighting right now are transports. Alliance boats have no dedicated guards, and level 20-30 townsfolk NPCs around them, Horde Zeppelins have elite guards all over the tower.
---
Use your brain pls. He obviously means they are dead on the alliance side
---
Please don't tell me you're a priest...if so you should be doing DM E jump runs as shadow...I mean you can do them as Boomy as well if your a druid although they are slightly harder and if your a pally go ZF. 
---
Point is farming instances is always better Gold per hour and while it's nice to be able to farm in the open world I wouldn't be doing it from a gold perspective anyway unless I was PVPing in the zone at the same time.
---
Yup, which is why I'm trying to get rank 12 to get the purple version, but I don't see it as very likely.
---
Can confirm, I've been playing less and less WoW and have been really enjoying Sea of Thieves, where PvP encounters actually give you a fighting chance instead of getting sapped and instakilled by a skull-level rogue three times in ten minutes. There's a lot of stuff I love about WoW and I'm glad I got a chance to play it because I never had before Classic, but it feels more and more like a chore and I have to deal with so much dumb bullshit just to get a few rare moments of enjoyable gameplay. Every time I sign on now I just open up the map and stare at it in dread as I try to figure out which zone I feel like corpse-walking through today while barely gaining any XP at all. Tried doing dungeons to level instead and it took an entire goddamn hour just to get inside the instance.
---
That's exactly right, 3-4 times more people would be mega. However, current servers are 2x at worst (for very little amount of servers) and the average is 3-4k. Which isn't 3-4 times more, that's roughly equal.
---
Well I'm glad your lowbie experience is doing ok.  I'll be surprised if it stays that way 20 levels from now.
---
I don't see any way to justify what's going on though.  No one is holding a gun to their head to drive players out of the server. 
---
See what good "but we have to" is for an excuse at the end of the day, I'm not really seeing it.  You end up with a pvp title you didn't earn and a an endangered species for an opposing faction.  "But we have to!"
---
Right.
---
Nochanges ruined classic to some degree, because the world grew up while vanilla did not
---
WHERE IS THE SUBREDDIT MANAGER REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Thankfully reddits ignore list is a lot longer than wows haha. I silence clowns like the dude above. Not worth even talkin to em.
---
It's also a level 80 skill, so not particularly useful for classic bank alts...
---
13000
---
There is nothing specific that you can farm to get it to drop.  You might farm something and get lucky.  Though the most reliable way of getting it would be to farm the gold to buy it.
---
How is this comment even remotely related to the topic or helpful? Lol
---
&gt;This is all sourced and quoted. 
---
The problem here is that this is not true. 
---
&gt;You’re an embarrassment 
---
Someone’s mad Reddit didn’t worship your little “discovery”, huh? If blizzard removes the addon, then so be it. In the meantime, nobody cares that this is coming from you. Oh man, I can already feel the rage burning inside you as you read this.
---
Ignore reddit, gank away :)
---
You don't need full mana for each pull, stay in range of the tank and just keep healing him. If you ask for a mana break and he doesn't let you mana up hes just dumb, but you don't need to drink every pull (or shouldn't need to I should say.)
---
you should know that axe spec realy works on 63+ lvl mobs. For 62 lvl you can use whatever you have.
---
Who is 'we'?
---
its not really suppose to but rather just eliminate most of the gank squads
---
Pretty much never use fear in a dungeon. Any melee, including the tank, will find it very frustrating because they can't properly attack the mob. And when a feared mob runs into range of another mob, they will pull that too. There are some situations, but that's kind of advanced and something you should learn with experience as you play more. 
---
It's good for pvp and solo though. I don't play a lock, so I'm not sure how hard this is, but I know some locks I play with that alternate between Fear and Curse of Recklessness to control a mob and have them run back and forth in a small area. That's probably something you could try and practice. It's always a good idea to try and practice some skills when out solo.
---
You intentionally gimp yourself out of some strange misplaced sense of chivalry and are upset that others aren't doing the same.  Sounds like a PVE server would be a much better place for you.
---
yea they killed devilsaur farm......... fuckers
---
The issue is that horde on the imbalanced pvp servers arnt just camping boats and end game zones. They are safeapoting in low level zone camping people trying to level, they are worth no honor, they get nothing from it, it's about not being total assholes with no respect for people's time. They do this because the other zones are so overpopulated with horde they can't get any honor. And all they are doing is stopping people from leveling creating a greater imbalance. Horde are not only hurting themselves but the longevity of the game.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11122/carrot-on-a-stick
---
Uh... No it doesn't
---
Because the supply was based on a maximum population of 3,000 concurrent players but now we have several times that amount.
---
“bUt pVp ShOuLnT bE ThIs bAd!1!1!”
---
maybe on servers like faerlina
---
Nothing, the sub is fine as it is, do not listen to whiners.
---
I had a feeling you would say everyone is the competition. I agree with things like gathering routes you don't want to share that but I guess I view PVP differently and the more information shared the better.
---
Anyone know the discord or have a good guide for paladins?
---
Planning on leveling an alt to 35 for professions and I want to try out a paladin since they seem awesome to me.
---
&gt; that don't break any rules
---
What part of that is so hard to understand? You're twisting what he said to fit your narrative. As long as it doesn't break the rules, you should be able to say what you want.
---
&gt; doesn't matter when a warrior is sitting on your ass 24/7 and you have to keep spending your mana to shield yourself
---
you should be bringing mages
---
theyre the most played class atm and a few in your group makes any warriors completely useless
---
Well done!
---
Dude.. the render distance is actually atrocious feels like it’s 40 yards a lot of the time
---
They are honor grinding because the guide told them too.
---
I don't think you're understanding that I'm not arguing that it isn't the best, lol. It is the best. It's just not worth the money IMO compared to other rings you can get.
---
No one cares about literally everything else too because every conversation about the game has already been had hundreds of times over in the last 15 years.
---
I cAnT eVeN pLaY tHe GaMe
---
so how many u want to spend? 20? that is atleast the number and sure enjoy the CD :)
---
I love how 15 years ago the alliance camped the fuck out of horde and generally outnumbered the horde.
---
Here we are, 15 years later, we all grew up and little and apparently picked horde..... interesting.
---
Also inb4 "well, actually".
---
I would also have to convince my entire guild + friends to switch with me. The game is shit without people I already know playing with me, never group with randoms is a good way to play this game.
---
you should look up the definition of bigot  
---
because that's what you are right now with this comment :)
---
greater is the one u get unlimited free off from strat ud :))
---
lmao just stop making posts
---
Menethil is in contested territory. Unlike horde, alliance can’t travel between continents without getting flagged except via mage portals.
---
The rule of thumb is crit is roughly 12 SP and hit is roughly 15 SP for a geared lock. With that being said, time spent life tapping, using pots or oom means no shadowbolts casting which will decrease overall damage which is why I don't go full shadow damage gear.
---
You couldn't even think of one word, a single word, that was similar to that in the given context?
---
Just make a weekly "PvP QQ Megathread" and contain all the crying there.
---
Indeed. It's been hilarious reading this subreddit since Honor was implemented. PvP servers were cancer years ago, and remained cancer all the way up to "War Mode". PvP will never be "fair" in Classic, because it was never fair in Vanilla and arguably has **never** been fair in some capacity.
---
I'll be over here on PvE, with everyone else having no issues playing the game and World PvPin at SS/TM when the mood strikes.
---
Are you serious? It’s hilarious to see nerd rage
---
&gt; But I feel you have the notion that Vanilla is some kind of perfectly balanced things that any change would destroy or make worse when it's just a happy mess of things that devs rushed, things they didn't expect, and things they corrected on the fly.
---
Nothing is perfect.  Many complaints are valid.  But fixing problems is almost impossible and I give you (or Blizzard) zero chance of success.
---
If you have ideas to "do Vanilla but better" then make a new MMO.
---
&gt;  In the end like you said: we have 15 years of experience so maybe it means that we know better now how to make the game better.
---
15 years of experience resulted in BFA.  BFA is being actively developed.
---
&gt; One thing is clear: phase 2 was a total disaster because there was no attempt to solve any of the big shortcoming that plenty of people totally anticipated. So are my ideas perfect? obviously not as some I just imagined in the 3min I took to write the post, but your notion that nothing is possible to make things better? nah.
---
The only thing that's clear to me is that people are extremely whiny.  The only "shortcoming" that I am concerned with is faction imbalances.  Most of the whining is infantile.
---
AKA every alliance player’s comment I’ve ever read in this subreddit
---
Its like a magician performing a trick
---
I am currently leveling as horde on Firemaw aswell. When I got to Winterspring it wasn't too bad. It feels like most of the allies are just trying to farm easy low level kills
---
I'm not a warrior tank so I'm not 100% sure, but you also want to keep in mind that dmg overall causes threat, so more damage in any way possible will mean more agro for you in a good way.
---
Remove the whining and direct the whiners to the official forums where they can get trolled appropriately. Classic experience.
---
I second this. It's not horde or alliance problem. It's a people problem
---
Hi oliilo! I've done that with the other videos I've posted on here, but for some reason they don't get nearly as much interest that way :)
---
Same man (about the first part)! Hunters are insanely fun in PvP because there is so much you can do. You will be a melee destroyer (rogues and warriors) and make a huge difference in group fights. One thing that people might not mention is to almost always have rank 1 multishot bound to shift+whatever your multishot keybind is to save mana in pve (basically free autoshot for only 98 mana every time you use it). Never use arcane shot once you have aimed shot except when a warrior is charging you or something or any time you don't have 3 seconds to spare. Scatter shot -&gt; feign death -&gt; freeze trap -&gt; bandage -&gt; aimed shot -&gt; multishot -&gt; concussive shot will be your bread and butter in PvP...don't let noob hunters tell you "it's broken in classic i rerolled because of it" because it's definitely not. Iron grenades add even more kiting/spell interrupt ability as other people have said. Always hunter's mark any rogue you see first thing, and have flare ready on an accessible keybind and you shouldn't ever lose to a rogue at 60 especially if you have the PvP trinket and deterrance/counter attack from the survival tree. About the only macro you need is the one to make sure feign death and Pet Passive happen at the same time, but a Youtube search should show what you need really easily + some other helpful ones.
---
I remember that being the beginning of the end for wow for me. It began turning the game more into just another round based thing to play rather than a persistent world MMO.
---
 Holy shit if you had half the interest in avoiding ganks as you had writing this pile of garbage you could actually get somewhere in this game.

That's not what my point is.
---
Posts that provoke good discussion are good.
---
Similar posts should be removed with the original/best left up, agreed. That wasn't the topic at hand, that one is easy to decide on.
---
I'm also not sure where you got "low effort" from, or what you're quoting. That's a completely separate issue that wasn't being discussed here.
---
Bullshit. 2500-3k is the original CAP. So after that you sit in a queue until someone leaves. There should be no more than 3k on a server at once, ever. Transfers are not the answer when none of the servers are capped at vanilla levels which we were promised. How about if you don't like vanilla you go play something else, I just want the game we were promised.
---
I think there is a flaw in methodology here if you rate all Rogues roughly even. Perception is in no way as valuable as WotF.

I've had a mob resist pick pocket 3 times in a row.  Surely he wasn't going to resist it a third time as a blew vanish and prep...
---
...oh boy I was wrong.
---
It seems like the mobs NEVER resist when you have both vanish and prep up, but are like 99% resistant when you have both on CD.  Which is fine.  Pour some coffee/tea or do a quick core workout for 3 minutes while the CD's refresh.
---
Don't cut yourself on that edge
---
Indeed they have dropped on Sulfuras.
---
It was 7 weeks but yeah.
---
At no point were any phases ever set in stone. Just because they put up a slide once that said 6 phases and so and so was in each doesn't mean that was ever 100% guaranteed.
---
It makes absolutely 0 sense to think that phases wouldn't be staggered because that's
---
A) how vanilla was, and 
---
B) makes much more sense from a content release perspective
---
Since they hot fixed Vanish I haven’t had one resist or fail. Maybe just lucky.
---
Have you considered speaking to a professional rather than taking out your crippling depression on people in video games?

Don't forget consumables for both bear, cat, and healer, extra water, quests being done, and keys for instances (what I thought tanks always brought the keys for instances???).

And then there's the trinkets to swap to for aoe threat vs mitigation....  welp I'm off to collect moon cloth for a bottomless bag...

Phase 2 was supposed to be the best phase by far. It was supposed to be above and beyond anything else you could experience in WoW, but they fucked it. It's literally only downhill from here until Naxxramas which is actually a fun raid.
---
Holy shit, get out more
---
Their are literally no secrets in wow
---
Props to you for putting in the extra effort, but there should be absolutely no need to consumables in MC. Just saying, I think you're overexerting yourself for very little gain.

The raiding situation you're describing sounds pretty horrifying, though.

I played Alliance on a Horde dominant PvP server from patch 1.6 up through Legion and and no point was it anywhere near as bad as it is on Classic PvP servers now. The number of camping butthats has increased by an order of magnitude compared to Vanilla.
---
I’m not against being killed or even being killed frequently, but the nonstop camping takes it way too far.
---
Yes, the person getting boosted can just afk at entrance, really convenient if you are boosting yourself with a second account. But also it's just more fun to pull everything :)
---
I think enforcing it would be problematic. It should be something that be handled on a post by post basis. I don't want to have thread with some legitimate original and good points be filtered from people just because there's a complain as the basis of the argument.
---
Most guides have horde going to stonetalon as a break between northern and southern barrens due to level difference. The little camp on the border is probably the best spot to catch people.

Flasks suck for melee dps, healing and tanking in MC. I consider my guild average and we clear mc in 1.5 hours with a 10 minute break in the middle. Shit dies too fast for healers to go oom , tanks don’t need the extra hp and the only half decent flask would be spell power....
---
No? BWL will almost certainly be out in January, exactly like Vanilla.
---
It sucks that the only challenges I've had in classic have been related to being able to get the correct number of players online for the ridiculous raid group sizes. 40 man raids don't give me any impact either. I can play really well but because I'm less than 3% of the raid group nothing I really do matters beyond carrying my weight - the bare minimum.
---
I would love smaller raid sizes, more carefully tuned content, shorter corpse runs allowing harder, longer boss fights, and better itemization. Half of my MC BiS is blues from 5 man content because T1 is garbage and most of my equip slots don't have non tier alternatives. I guess what I'm describing is retail but BfA doesn't do it for me so this is what I've got.
---
stop talking about this or blizz will fix it like they did ony
---
Funny cause I completed that quest last week and thought exactly the same about the platform location. All I was thinking is « please no horde, please!! » Didn’t have much trouble about the other parts tho.

Damn this was great! Reminds of the good ol days of watching WoW machinima as a kid.

I Dropped 300 enchanting for herbing just to have something to do while I pvped

if you have a properly build 40man group where the dps are playing their class right you don't get to p2
---
Why is it that people blame one faction or the other? Is there like a quest to kill the other faction for one faction only or something? It seems to me like it would be the nature of the game and shitty players on both sides that are ruining the game for everyone, not just a particular faction? Are there just way more unbalanced servers in the favor of a particular faction? Are there just more people on the subreddit in a particular faction?

An MMO is perhaps the very last place you should be expecting a fair fight.  The genre was built around the philosophy of rewarding time investment and player cooperation over individual skill.
---
The monstrous amount of match rigging, dodging, colluding, borderline cheating, cheating and drama that'll happen in battlegrounds
---
Pretty much every feral druid out there will want the chest, so it's definitely not underwhelming. Hide goes for around 700g on our server.
---
What's your server?
---
because 1hour15mins is exactly the same as 1.15 hours right? rofl
---
Could I do mara runs as moonglow?
---
&gt;  so they reply for tanking with their DPS spec and probably even tank with a 2H weapon
---
You absolutely, 100%, without-a-doubt should be tanking with a 2h and DPS spec until the later levels (I'd say, 50+).
---
I didn't say it was guarenteed but that was their plans. And according to their plans it would've been 2-3 months, but it makes sense they dropped those stupid plans. On the other hand would be nice if they actually had a content release plan instead of just announcing new stuff 1-2 weeks in advance...
---
Either remove or cap the honor gain outside of BGs.
---
Yeah, but it's a hassle. You have to actually keep an eye on your health and some of the devilsaurs have a fear that can make you pull other mobs. Much easier to just hibernate + starfire on repeat.

Yeah it is

*AOE Mage #2738483538 has left the group*

I think they both are pretty much the same in the end too, mostly a matter of preference and habit.
---
still you only rank against people on your faction from your server so I have 1/10th the competition I had on a hrode dominated server
---
Because it's just the cap which isn't filled on most servers already.
---
&gt; "Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds."
---
&gt; The fact they don't have any queues means they aren't overpopulated
---
I'd normally think you were trolling since you're contradicting what you said earlier, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt as maybe you have simply been living under a rock. Server population cap is currently roughly twice as high as they were back in vanilla. Blizzard lied. This has nothing to do with transfers.
---
&gt; Do I ever need to use SS? Example: I am at 10% and rooted in front of a target at 25%. I SS to grab the fifth cp so I can Cold Blood/Evis for the finisher
---
You'd probably be using Gouge, or Ghostly Strike (40 energy) as priority before even considering Sinister Strike. This is of course wondering why you're rooted in the first place when you could have used a 'free action potion' or various other mechanics to not be rooted.
---
&gt; Which daggers should I get for pvp? Can I buy the lobotomizer right when AV comes out?
---
You could, but you'd likely have a good chance (and be significantly better off) just buying a Perdition's Blade (i.e. for gold) from one of the more hardcore guilds on your server. It's a hell of a lot better and (not that getting AV rep is hard) the time/effort could otherwise be spent for dedicated gold farming. The 'quality' of your weapon makes a massive difference in your experience with dagger oriented builds.
---
&gt; Which classes do I open with Ambush? Do I ever use cold blood with ambush or is it not worth it?
---
It really depends on your talents and the 'gear' of your target. The fact that you're considering ambush at all means your goal is to get as much burst as you can.
---
&gt; What rotation do you use solo against mobs? During down time can I farm Essence of Water easily as backstab build or am I going to have trouble?
---
Depends if you're fishing or getting it another way. Backstab builds are terrible for solo farming (due to positional requirement).

Confession time, when looking at those items I forgot feral druids exist. Sorry my shapeshifting friends. There was even a feral druid in the run when it dropped. 😔
---
I think I more than adequately described the probability that the design of the game itself incentivizes poor behavior and brings out the very worst in people, but I also think there is ample evidence that gaming communities,  and more specifically one for a relatively niche PC-only title, don't exactly constitute a sample of normal people.
---
Even so, I think the majority of folks playing classic are fine. It may seem that every last horde player is gleefully camping every zone 24/7, but as I've said that's mostly a product of the absurd pserver-style population  caps on classic realms. It need not be even close to a majority of a community filled with assclowns to severely damage a game that is this poorly-designed.
---
I also think the idea that everyone participating is merely taking advantage of incentives is demonstrably bullshit. Maybe I shouldn't ascribe to malice what I can to stupidity, but you can't convince me the raid groups of folks killing honorless targets off flight paths or killing 10 dudes an hour at the BRD portal are doing so because of incentives. 
---
I take no issue at all with the roaming 5-10 man groups that exist in most zones. I don't care about getting ganked and camped by them. The game is the game. I'm just not sure what conclusion I'm supposed to draw about some of the other people. Whether they're assholes or just heroically stupid, the game isn't causing that. 
---
My opinion of the average person is not low at all. My opinion of pserver communities was low long before we knew we were getting this game.
---
Any source for "no"?
---
I wouldn't say that's "great use", but to each their own I guess. That is VERY limited usage, and it gets even more limited when you factor in that it's not always beneficial to get our of the frost nova. But yeah, crippling poison can be very good to keep clear of, of course.
---
No?
---
Is that because you like being kited or just that you don't like winning fights?
---
That’s a good idea! Thank you
---
Definitely not all your gold you gotta diversify, also theres still money to be made despite other people also preparing for the same event. The amount or people playing this game who dont know what's going on right now nevermind 6 month from now is really high..
---
i just run around it, already having to wait a minute or so at the end to avoid lockout so gaining an extra 45 seconds by spending 1.5g is silly.
---
Honor per hour will probably be better because groups will aim to finish BG’s as quickly as possible. Honor gain via BG’s isn’t about HK’s. They’ll also supplement with roaming during queue times.
---
I suspect the ganking will decrease slightly though.
---
It gets more populated around 7-8 server time. Honestly it’s not too bad but we are on the smaller side based on raid logs. Severely lacking tanks like every server so I’ve had a great time so far on the warrior I rolled.
---
dude and I tell you I did the thing described above and I only have recombobulator ray no minor recombobulator ray
---
Well shiet
---
Not everyone wants the same thing, so at the end of the day it's going to be an arbitrary choice by the mods. Personally, I can feel the brain cells leak out of my head as I scroll through my front page and basically every contribution from this sub is a meme or PvP whinging. If it were balanced I wouldn't be as irritated, but as it stands this sub is negative value.
---
So you're telling me this one Shaman is doing more work than anyone else in the group? Mages press 1 button until the boss is dead. This Shaman is assisting almost everyone in the raid.
---
While I'm with you in spirit here, you beg the question that these are the same individuals making these statements, when in fact it is a population of people with different opinions.  And pointing out hypocrisy isn't really an argument for any particular action (tu quoque fallacy) anyway.
---
cool, ill check out lasher/satyrs next. thanks!
---
We talk again in two years time and then we see;)
---
It's definitely a bit easier to herb on my server.
---
Always plan like 3 hours to do a very basic run.
---
1hr - 1hr 30min for the dungeon (providing it goes smoothly and no wipes)
---
Then the rest of the time for dying, rezzing, dying, rezzing
---
Hell yeah, thank you!
---
&gt;  The amount or people playing this game who dont know what's going on right now nevermind 6 month from now is really high..
---
For sure. Even more reason why I don't have to invest right now, and can wait 3~4 months, though.
---
Could be worse, could of picked the trinket 😂
---
That wasn’t edgy at all.  It was a broad perspective that goes beyond the sub.  Think big brain memes.
---
Dude this is amazing. 10/10 never stop doing this if you love it
---
Folks are pretty fast and loose with the word ganked recently. Used to have a pretty specific meaning.
---
Holy shit you guys are a bunch of fucking pussies
---
Fair, I can't seem to get by, but I am lvl 48.  Also have alch on my main so not really a big cost.
---
Wow, that’s dickish.  1.15 as a ratio would equal 1 hour and 9 minutes.
---
Time to get a new weapon, at that level WW axe is equal to or worse then some green items. I recommend running uldaman. You can get a good mace or sword from the last boss. Also you may be able to pick up a cheap warmonger from the AH not a great weapon but it's underrated. Get some sharpening stones, and get a +7 wep dmg enchant at least. Also check out your other gear, and see what you can improve. If you can't afford enchants pick up some armor kits every little bit helps. Even get some pots or str/Stam scrolls from the AH.
---
Seems like it's an honorspy issue not EU problem. EU servers are just more tryhard and bigger and thus broke the game earlier it would seem. Faerlina had similar issues.
---
Think it's more like this reddits userbase is predominately dad gamers on their 2k pop transfer server.
---
&gt;and to those people talking about Superior Mana Pots or Agi over Mongoose... You're part of the problem here. It's not difficult to achieve the bare minimum that any respectable raid guild would require.
---
No, you're part of the problem. If you're in a guild that expects people to tryhard that's fair but not everyone gives a shit about their logs or dps meters. 
---
And that's more than fine. If people want to use weaker consumes and they still down content I don't think there's any problem with that. 
---
The attitude you're pushing is fine for people that want to play that way, but there's nothing wrong with people who dont.
---
Being competent at your role and showing up is way more important anyway.
---
30 to 34 ppl most raid nights. Mc cleared in 2 hours.  Not one flask.  Very little other consumes.  Nothing mandatory.  Not hardcore, just casual.  Decent core of skill, smattering of all sorts to round it off.  
---
Its not being in touch with the reality of things going on around you that makes you sound elitist here.
---
Not just skeram lots of servers are like this right now.
---
That escalated quickly
---
Kill 100% of horde on sight
---
I know many people don't care about this tournament, but it was amazing to see this low chance in action. The mirror match was the tiebreaker
---
Not really. People will be ganking while waiting in que. 
---
You get what you deserve playing on high pop relms
---
This is a fundamental issue with reddit as a whole, it's not a fact finding system, it is a sentiment analysis system.  Up and down votes have nothing to do with truth, but more to do with how people feel. 
---
This sort of system is great for things like cat pictures, memes, and 5 second video clips, but largely useless for anything that takes more than ~5 seconds of attention.
---
Where do people recommend leveling at lvl 51 during this PVP explosion?
---
Lol he's literally right though
---
Guess you caught him telling fibs.
---
I enjoyed that, alot. Nice.
---
You can fix certain aspects without making the game overall easier. Simply changing the honor system to punish corpse camping or camping of grays would be a good change without altering the game.
---
There is no benefit. You don't lose "community" with it (like you did with LFG). Its artificial "difficulty" caused by other players so it's not making the game "easier".
---
&gt;Posts that provoke good discussion are good.
---
Only if the post itself is facilitating or aiding in that discussion. A post that says "wow is cancer" and then somewhere in the comments section 4 hours later after much back and forth Bob and Tim scientifically disprove the OPs point doesn't mean it was a good post. This very topic is proving that. 
---
&gt;I'm also not sure where you got "low effort" from, or what you're quoting. That's a completely separate issue that wasn't being discussed here.
---
What do you mean? Whining/complaint threads such as this are low effort. A meme with an unmodified caption is low effort. It generally refers to shitty one liners and jokes that don't really harbor or facilitate further discussion.
---
But you said you group with 0 people lol
---
I'm on a 70/30 alliance favoured pvp server so buying the biscuits takes so long it's actually better to buy normal stuff and use the extra time to farm gold
---
Problem is honor system encourages you to farm lower level enemies
---
It was yesterday, something to do with an add-on
---
....these exist?
---
Small Flame Sacs was until the pvp patch, now there are too many Alliance to farm effectively.
---
This one.
---
That is not an argument. That is a reaffirmation of your already held belief. Also known as a tautology.
---
Signficantly yes.
---
You get way more honor per hour in BG's, like 5 times more honor per hour at least. However due to potential queues you might see pvpers head to close by zones to gank. This will be felwood, WPL, searing gorge and Burning steppes. We don't know yet how long the queues will be, but likely it will be fairly short, and only queues on horde(there's only queues on 1 faction per battlegroup). A side effect is however that everyone on the faction that has queues will be ganking, while all the pvpers on the other faction will have instant queues. This creates an imbalance in the pvp zones, but the overall amount of players should signficantly be reduced.
---
Titans is only 100g on faerlina. If it saves the raid even one wipe, it’s probably worth it. With a 40 man raid, preventing one wipe saves 2 hours of time assuming a 3 minute reset which is probably pretty generous for most guilds. It also speeds up clears by allowing the main tank to pull faster and riskier trash.
---
&gt; Not sure why so many of you are against rolling new toons on PvE realms 
---
ItS nOt ThE cLaSsIc ExPeRiEnCe
---
So you sabotaged the addon instead of letting blizzard deal with it?
---
Actually, no joke on the Feralas front. I was getting camped by a few mooks and asked in General if anyone wanted to help.
---
I just wanted yeti hides, but some 15 people ran up and properly spanked this warlock, his hunter friend, and (unfortunately) the one other hunter that seemed pretty chill when we waved at each other into submission.
---
I got my Yeti hides.
---
I started a warlock alt on my PVP server, only level 19 so far but considering starting one on a PvE server. Not sure if BGs on Dec 10th will make my server less unbearable
---
I thought you were gonna quick cut to them mining each others skulls instead of the ore.
---
I agree with what you've stated wholeheartedly and have upvoted accordingly.
---
Nah, they'll just do TBC servers. Easier and safer bet.
---
If you want challenging PvE there's retail, Classic is strictly for casual boomer rp.
---
It's not true for literally everything though? Resources from dungeons aren't in any way limited by population. Black lotuses on the other hand exclusively spawn in the overworld
---
You just shouldn't need to. We saw phase two our first week before everyone got pre-raid BIS items, but that's about it. Unless people aren't in gear that makes them raid-ready there's no real reason anyone should see P2 at all.
---
The troll shaman?!
---
Depends how you frame it. They won in the sense that they accomplished their goal of ruining other people's fun for a few weeks. They lose in the sense that they have to deal with their crippling mental issues for the rest of their lives.
---
One of those things is probably much worse
---
1.15h is 1h 9min
---
I go so lost doing this quest.  Running toward the southernmost point, I fell into the Canyon of Random Murlocs and Elites for Some Reason and was on the verge of crying with frustration before I found my way out.
---
You chose to roll on a big server? There's plenty of medium popped ones you can transfer to for free even.
---
It's okay. Everyone forgets we exist.
---
1.15 hr is NOT 1 hr 15 mins lol. Clearly your the one with the pea sized brain.
---
Yup. Was fun, realized it's not for me anymore, uninstalled.
---
I've enjoyed rolling my alts on my main server to the point where I have to quest in Redridge or Ashenvale, then it's too difficult
---
3k is not dead. 3k is fully populated in vanilla. 
---
Anyone that calls a 3k pop server dead has clearly never played vanilla and only played on psevers.
---
If they're in an alliance zone and have been for (i think) 5 minutes then they aren't flagged for pvp. You'll have to go to a contested zone. If you're on a pvp server then they have to be flagged there. If you're on a pve server then you'll have to find someone who willingly flagged themself.
---
Yea I've always thought it funny that many classic players feel they're somehow spiting blizzard by giving them a fuckton of revenue.
---
Plenty of items spawn exlusively in the world.
---
that’s what my RL buddy who is also in charge of the locks wants to do, debuff assigns. but I just don’t know enough about each and everyone and their variances. that’s why I was hoping for like a general, standard baseline. we’ve been doing a good job lately, he just is getting a little annoyed when his classes curses fall off lol
---
Images like this make me glad I play on a PvE server. This just doesn't look enjoyable at all.
---
lmao, playing games as a whole is a bit tragic. MMOs especially 
---
But still, a big part of wow as i understand it is bragging about your achievements. Every time i see 2 wow players meet the first thing they talk about is their rank/max raid/whatnot
---
Best shit I’ve seen all month man! Great job!
---
The lesson I've learned is communication makes all the difference. Your first group was most likely made up of people who understand game and group mechanics. Your second group was made up of "Big Dick" players. 
---
You're in a great position as the Tank. When you put the group together and you're the tank you get to dictate the pace and the flow of the group. 
---
Players not falling in line? Communicate what you're seeing and how is impacting the group and make suggestions to improve the group dynamic. They respond in a toxic way? Terrific, there's a fire sale on DPS right now and with a couple clicks your group is ready to buy! 
---
I've gotten to the point where I can sniff out shit groups, especially in PuGs. I'm respectful and try to be informative. Some respond positively because they simply unaware. Some act like Thrall's Gift to Azeroth and that's good, because they'll end up solo'ing everything after I remove them.
---
There's a lot of ways to get shit done in this game. The devil is in the details. If you're experienced and you know what it takes to get things done, communicate as such.
---
Finally- methodical play is not only more enjoyable on the classes that often get stressed (Tanks / Healers) it's almost always faster. You'll shave seconds off the run by chain pulling. You'll add minutes to run by corpse running back.
---
yep, 60 hunter on pvp realm.  done with the ganking scene..   just rolled on a pve realm and i am enjoying the laid back atmos so much more.. im a casual now a days.. too old for that pvp crap.
---
Which one do u prefer? Silent or open bidding?
---
What jumps?
---
no the % wasnt supposed to be tehre
---
star is for shackle
---
Big true here, OG blizz forums were a complete shit show.
---
I bet they looked something like this: https://giphy.com/gifs/94EQmVHkveNck
---
Who uses Thorium arrows outside of raids and pvp?
---
Asmon just crying all day that he gets killed on a pvp server.... ah poor boi.
---
I have zero raid gear and I'm farming dm east just fine. The sacrifice I avoid completely by always keeping him LoS  with the pillar by the water boss. I clear the flasher and imp pack (enslave big guy, rain of fire with him, dot the imps) for a little more breathing room on the high ground. You can also try and keep shadow absorb up in case you slip up and get sacrificed
---
And yet it happens constantly.
---
Honestly, just some better flairs and flair enforcement. Then add pre-made flair filters at the top of the sub. That literally fixes 90% of the issues I see in most subs.
---
Side-thought: does the automod already delete non-flaired posts?
---
A. I'm not even a horde player
---
B. You didn't play in classic if you genuinely think this. That, or you just played on an extremely standout server. Factions were dicks to each other all the time. It's part of the game to murder your enemies on PvP. The entire reason why Blizzard implemented language barriers between horde and alliance is BECAUSE there is so much animosity and shitflinging between the two factions. Maybe you don't play to make things difficult for your enemies but I do. That's part of playing PvP. Play PvE if you don't like it.
---
Maybe youre not so stupid the 3rd time. Last time, and now in full caps so you actually read, WHERE DID HE QUOTE THAT IT WAS EFFECTING ALL SERVERS? Try proving that ur not this massive embarrasment that cant answer simple questiond
---
are you saying you dont use modifiers like ctrl shift or alt for abilities?
---
Try to understand how time is actually written instead
---
The goblin mortar is a thing
---
If you don't want to tell your server that's ok. You don't have same cap because Blizzard decided so, you are free to play or unsub, duh.
---
Because were in ironforge typing away while horde camps flight paths.
---
I love these posts. If it’s red it’s dead. Simple rules to live by.
---
Silent, I want to save time.
---
It will help a little but I highly doubt it will be drastically different. Are you still going to be required to queue from Battlemaster?
---
roll a pve forum if you can't handle it
---
#1 gets 13000, you might be confused because there are 14 brackets, that's because the first bracket is 1-400 and the second one is 400-1000 RP and then 1k leading up to 13k for the person in bracket 14.
---
30-40 alliance is THE worst
---
Learning time! -
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they
---
They does not imply multiples. I corrected your statement that it would be 10 honor or less, namely because you went on to say "depending on how many they are(which can be 1)". There is no target that is worth below 40 honor in a 1v1 situation.
---
This is what I do to! First to cross, last to move on. I wait in the caboose and watch until we’re all clear.
---
Time for a new guild.
---
They do. But they run around. As a gang and can't be everywhere at once
---
yah pretty much all scenarios end with dead healer lol
---
I'm also on a PVE server and having a blast. Not really much of a shortage of tanks but I can confirm that questing on Alts is not stressful at all. Seems like most of the people are pretty mature (Those that aren't are easily ignored).
---
I totally understand the OH, I have three (spirit, spellstone, and rose).   That MH, though, the proc rate seems not worth vs. just more spellpower or stats.
---
Most of what you said I can agree with. But fucking Kargath?  Alliance can actually hang out in their capital city and have their hearth set to some other convenient location
---
Meanwhile horde are pretty much obligated to have their hearth permanently set to Kargath for raiding purposes
---
I've seen this movie, La-La Land?
---
You ever find that the hellfire of the enslaved demon doesn't do enough damage and the imp kill him too quick? What dots do you use on the imps? I can get them down but it always seems touch and go
---
And you just HAD to announce it to the world, eh? 
---
Man I love attention whores! /s
---
If you were really fed up and it was really useless you would just leave without saying shit, you're just seeking attention.
---
You are literally the whiny cock, JonerPwner. More like BonerPwned ur little tight asshole.
---
More megathreads. Soak up all the whining about P2 in one thread etc.
---
How did we choose them? Blizzard decided to not cap server populations.
---
Piggybacking off the top comment to share [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4mcpo/ion_hazzikostas_each_layer_is_effectively_going/), reminding everyone that there is NO PROOF that we have more than 4k concurrent players on Classic servers (besides a few broken census addons). As far as Blizzard's told us, we are all playing on servers accurate to 2004 concurrent player caps.
---
Thank you for some validation. With all the down votes I was really wondering if I've been researching the wrong things all this time.
---
Personally I found the effort I put in WW not worth it, it is awesome if you have high level friends that help you get it at 30 but by 44 you should have better. What race are you? As a human I found swords and maces better due to the higher skill. Either weapon from Archaedas in Uldaman is amazing at 44. You are arms spec right? If so then are you abusing Mortal Strike? If you are an Orc then this should be ignored and you go hard into axes, their increased crit is great.
---
However, the majority of max level people who are interested in camping would be reduced by 500%.
---
I've noticed chat delays during peak hours on Grob but only for a few seconds at a time.
---
lol the only consume i bring to raid is one resto pot and no1 uses flasks. we clear mc in 1.5 hrs nothing crazy but still nice
---
Most people went PVP because that shit was fun as fuck back in Vanilla.
---
Today's PVP servers cannot compare because even unbalanced servers didnt have the same issues in Vanilla to such a degree.
---
The problems were the same but the magnitude of which they are bad are far greater in classic.
---
Bgs are cross realm which sucks
---
Create a sticky for w pvp complaints and another for those who want to make fun of those complaining about w pvp so they don't up 75% of the feed every day.
---
lmao he just called you sweaty
---
Yeah man, im on an RP server and this lvl 1 was yelling in orgrimmar "HEAR YE! HEAR YE! THE ALLIANCE DOGS ARE GATHERING AN ARMY IN THE SOUTH OF THE BARRENS, CALLING ALL ABLE BODIED FIGHTERS TO GO AND REPEL THESE INVADERS" (or somthing like that anyway) i bowed before him, flagged for pvp and ran into battle. We won obviously because only 3 or 4 people play alliance but it was a lot of fun.
---
Why would you want to do something?
---
I don't. Gehennas is popping and I love this shit.
---
I would say the exact opposite... The problems of being camped and ganked repeatedly could be solved if there was just way more on each side.. Then its not just a personal battle, its a war, ad each side is fighting for territory... Also make it so theres no safe zones.. So even if youre in your own city or zone you can still be attacked.. Im sick of the entire fucking alliance just sitting in ironforge standing in the commons doing nothing.. Using WoW as a $15 a month chat room. Make it so theyre not safe there.
---
Just make sure you have enough defense to be uncrushable when redoubt procs. :)
---
Both Kurrinaxx and Benidiction have no issues with the chat box.
---
Self regulate lol.
---
The players are the fucking issue lol
---
you've been blocked. grow up
---
I suggest the ghosts at the end of dire mail north. The guys in blasted lands won't stay ranged on you.
---
Really well done. Hard to make me laugh but I did :)
---
This is what earthfury is like too. Used to be only 10k auctions on the AH during primetime, now it's pushing north of 17k. 
---
Like 10 new ally guilds have popped up, many from places like faerlina and a couple from blaumeaux. It's becoming an ally heavy server.
---
It used to be so balanced and had around a perfect medium-large population. Now the faction balance is going out the window and the AH is nuts and everything is overcrowded.
---
Go into your raid tab and in the top right there a "Raid Info" or something similar button.  Click that, if it lists an MC raid ID, you are locked.
---
It's only a on a select few. So basically. Sucks you picked a bad server. Seems like an overpopulation issue.
---
Mate you miss the 20 words part ?
---
"Sure, I agree that if it doesn't break rules it should be allowed."
---
Great, then I'm not sure why we are having this debate when we see eye to eye. 
---
Never judge someone based off what you see from others. I didn't see the OP break any rules or display any "bigot" like behavior so i'm not going to lump him in with people that do.
---
Cool, I will give that a try.  Now to just find the time to make effective use of being in a party with myself (I feel weird asking people to help with the party reset trick)
---
&gt;holy shit you are bad at tanking then lol
---
The only nodes I’ve found you couldn’t mine were ones in the East tunnels with the wasps. For all other nodes you can just Agro one elite and stun them in between mining. I use cheap shot-&gt;gouge-&gt;kidney shot-&gt;gouge. This lets you mine the max 4 times before vanishing. I average 1-2 arcane crystals an hour + ore and dense stone.
---
sorry, did you come to classic? don't you know what awaits you?
---
the PvP scene will be dominated by premades in full purple rolfstomping pugs and 'casual'. Their raison d'etre is to be a fodder for the hardcore's dark edge of insanity / might of menethil.
---
the 5-man scene basically over after a weekend of instance running... after that, you're left with 3-manning angerforge for your HoJ or buying a ring from some hunter solo'ing DM cause it's more efficient than running tribute over and over.
---
your best geared / best player will get poached by higher progressed guilds, the market/black lotus will be camped/controlled by an organized mafia, the dominant PvP group on both side with collude with eachother in order to NOT queue into eachother (ensuring more noob get stomped), you'll be laughed out of AQ guild if you don't have BWL gear and end up trying to play a never-ending game of catch up...
---
but you knew this when signing up for classic, right? That's the best part about it no? No filthy gear reset every tier like retail, no alternate gearing path; you raid, PvP 12 hour a day, or you're a scrub...
---
yeah I'm just surprised Frost, who I respect, would just take the hiveminds word for it and parrot this when it's so braindead easy to test. That's my only point lol
---
This is what I do.
---
Though personally, I don't mind shitposts either way.
---
Haha good. That’s why I came here to troll this morning. To piss off you no-lifers. 
---
You are so upset you tracked down and replied to multiple comments of mine. Fucking hilarious.

Pretty sure that's because it's actually 50 yards.
---
Say something before someone rolls.  “All need?” Is the way to go imo.  If someone rolls greed, you say “all greed?”
---
Lol that's a very spiteful comment about high pop realms
---
&gt; from the pvp tab im guessing my server has at least 8k active players
---
How do you determine server concurrent players from the honor tab? Theoretically those 8k players could be playing at different times of day with a 3k concurrent player cap, right?
---
r/crappymusic
---
Must be, wouldn't know... Do tell me though
---
Yeah the goal is to keep like colors, trap is usually square or triangle
---
I had so many alliance help kill quest objectives and elites along my lvling grind. Now you see a guy 8 lvls lower and he’s still out here casting fireballs on you. Like wtf is going on.  
---
And why the fuck are alliance camping out in hinterlands?? I’m lvl 50 but there are so many 43-47 that don’t even give honor, I don’t get it.
---
yeah it's just a quick switch for a swing then back to mageblade, usually happens during gcd
---
Holy shit there is some serious salt in this community about this topic.
---
If you didn't kill any bosses you shouldn't be saved. But open your social tab, go to the raid tab, and click raid IDs and see if you have an MC ID if you do your saved.
---
 Nah it’s okay. I’m the only skinner in our guild with finkles and the enchant so I have enough value to stay in the raid luckily lmao. Also always Top 10 in the feels and usually 2nd hunter. So I’ll be okay hopefully
---
Ahh, shit yeah I must be confused.
---
You certainly bum something bruh
---
(Your words not mine)
---
And you are somehow acting like this amount of people aren't camping from FP to BRM daily.
---
Inside dungeons, probably sunken temple then BRD.

Hm?

And lets not single out rogues as corpse campers; anyone can corpse camp and anyone can attack you when you have low health/mana.  Rogues are just better at it by design.
---
If people come in spewing pure toxicity, ban them for a week.
---
&gt; Always plan like 3 hours to do a very basic run. 
---
This is what's killing me. By the time I get home, sit in queue then log in, I don't have time to corpse hop then actually do the instance.  It blows right now, so I just hop on an alt and wait until I can queue for BG's.
---
I'm not. I left the Horde for the Alliance.
---
It tends to attract 4chan dipshits and other meme mentalities. Griefers and tryhards.
---
Not that the Alliance doesnt have them too, but in much fewer numbers.
---
Both side has their charms and downsides but the Horde are the "bad guys" and the community seems to generally reflect that.
---
This is a damn good idea! Thank you very much! I’ll be snagging some intellect gear and level by bow as well my daggers (&gt;•.•&gt;)
---
Stop supplying everyone imo. Sounds stressful. 
---
I'd outline what the bare minimum consumes are and leave it at.
---
And then you pray that the last person to roll won't dick you all over.
---
Yeah.
---
By how much likely depends on the state of the battlegroups/queue timers.
---
People forgot part of pvp servers are players who's enjoyment comes from you not having fun.
---
So that the people ahead of the curve could kill the people behind the curve.
---
This is the fakest of fake news, sad.
---
I think art posts should get a different tag than meme posts. Someone worked hard on making art.
---
Maraudon, Sunken Temple.
---
Errr, what? "We" as a community can make the game what it was by any means by not filling the server cap and keeping concurrent online as 3k. A lot of servers manage to do it.
---
I don't think the official forums ever stopped being that way, really. 
---
I always enjoyed reading the slapfights on the lore forum, in particular.
---
You still haven’t answered what are the bad side of removing honor gain from killing low level. 
---
But this discussion is going nowhere since you are mostly giving your opinion in a peremptory way without any explanations. Your only point is that BFA is bad and changes can only lead to BFA which I think is a fallacious logic.
---
BGs bring the change, cause its better Honor per Hour plus reputation for really good pvp items. No time wasted searching or waitng for victims. Que up, farm 10 players for 5min and repeat.
---
So the hardcore pvp players will sit at the BG npc whole day. You will see how suddently nobody wants to worldpvp anymore or very rarely, cause the only people left in the world are players who want do pve content as dungeons or farming. 
---
May sometimes you find a bored rogue roaming the blackrock cause he thinks he the better player, not better class if he gets 1 kill every 5min with all his cooldowns.
---
Its a bit sad. Cause this feeling of worldpvp is limited in time between release of Honorsystem and BGs.
---
Lets enjoy as long we can. I recommend Stranglethorn Vale. Its fast travel for horde and alliance. Just gank some till they log on mains. Every 3 Hours the Arena is really fun.
---
Oh no the manchild who refuses to prove his dumb claims has blocked me, how will i ever overcome this great loss?
---
Steps (and ideally delegate this, but still demand final say in the matter)
---
+ Make a list of all debuffs that appear / look into the logs and note the debuffs
---
+ Count how many unique debuffs appear and figure out how they're applied (who applies them, etc)
---
+ If the total count is greater than 16 (which, they are) then make a list of all the debuffs you think the raid would want to have active within the limit. Either because the debuffs do something important (decrease/increase damage), or are 'dots' that do the most out of all the dots going up.
---
+ Cull the list.
---
***
---
[As a rough example of what to think of](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/debuff-management-classic-wow) but don't treat this as gospel. It really really does depend on whoever you're throwing into the raid, maybe you have a Rogue throw up (Improved) Expose Armor rather than x5 Sunders (etc.)
---
Have you tried banning repetitive posts? The constant whine about World PvP can be placed into a single posts for all whiners to ramble constantly about their pathetic state of life.
---
You keep banning comments for breaking Rule 2, but you can't freaking ban repetitive whine posts no one likes? It seems pretty simple.
---
You guys do a good job around here, I've genuinely thought this was one of the better subreddits, but that you allow all this **whine of the minority of classic WoW** to fill the subreddit, just made it another horrible wow subreddit.
---
If I notice I don't really need a heal for the first 10-15 seconds of a fight I'll pull midway through a mana break, hoping the healer takes the hint and gets all the mana they can before healing. But most start overhealing when I'm at 85% health and then get annoyed that I pulled too fast.
---
Is Tuesday some kind of a peak pvp time?
---
Added a flair for this. We don't have a means to allow users to filter by flair type, but I've reached out to our CSS expert and asked him for input. No guarantees on this just yet, but at least adding the flair is a start, and we'll look into this further from here.
---
More like the herd is so lazy they just copy whatever they see on Twitch with understanding of the ramifications.

No but you can use limited invulnerability pots if she targets you when she lands to drop aggro for 6 seconds.
---
as others have said, type /raidinfo
---
4-6 pots for the Rag fight? That's a long ass fight.
---
Seeing as non soul shard items can't be placed in your soul bag there's really no reason not to keep it full.
---
They will if enough people were to do it and they see their honor gains start dropping.
---
Well it is true as they force it to be true.
---
Lead up to launch and time between launch and the honor system was a goldmine of creativity and memes tbh
---
This actually happened to me as a hunter. Server lag gave me a Talisman instead of the Neck. There is nothing to Blizzard will do to resolve it. I would not even choose the Talisman on a warrior let alone on a tank. I didn't even want the item replaced with the Neck just allow me to buy another head from the guild and resubmit the quest. And they told me to fuck off. 
---
So until Nef I am rocking a blue.
---
I dunno I play on PvE mostly and people have been really good about it.  If they accidentally roll need on a BoE, the person who needed often asks for a reroll.
---
Make one version of a raid just make it stupid hard to keep all the theme park players out. Keep what you kill and not participation awards.
---
That is an argument I have made myself, and there is a chance that it is true but I don't believe that anymore. The servers feel overfull. That is not proof or data, but it is a feeling that many people I talk to have. So the census addons may be wrong, but it seems like they could be correct.
---
Ooo struck a nerve!

---
You can't learn tradeskills until lvl 5
---
Enchanting, even with just 1 skill point, let's you DE all those lvl 56 green items for big stacks of dust and essence and other mats
---
Ta coming from You as the OP lol. You made a giant post that could easily be summarized as "omg will ppl stop ganking me after bgs"
---
No, you are. You have not provided jack shit other then your own opinions.
---
Yeah you wish buddy, just give up this game. You already lost.
---
Its true that this is a bit weird. I just mean that horde always have a safe place to go near important areas, alliance have no such place. Chillwind camp vs bulwark; kargath vs morgan's vigil.
---
The WoW community at large is EXTREMELY toxic and has fallen into a rut of whining about every minor inconvenience they encounter. They go straight to Blizz and openly flame the devs working to make this game better. There's a generation of people who live in the World of Warcraft and all they know is pure salt and nerd rage. It's very sad.
---
What are those telescope looking things?
---
Are are you talking about? Spelling is accurate. 😜
---
For me. I spend more time on here and wowhead than playing the game. Work and life and such :(.
---
Stop deleting meme posts.
---
Also there is pretty decent loot from Rep rewards so the shitty geared gankers may just farm bgs for loot/rep
---
Try to always aim for a full soul bag. And replenish as soon as you can. If your raiding, i say run a dungeon before, get about 40. Helps with summons, cookies, ss, and spawning demon friends.
---
Most of the threat you’re going to generate against the main target will be white damage. That aside, strength is also going to help you kill things faster, which is more important sub 60 than damage mitigation.
---
People are realizing how unfinshed and how many issues Vanilla actually had. The absolute best thing about the game in the past was its community, but thats the one thing that cant be exactly replicated.
---
I love Vanilla and am having fun playing Classic, but I dont think its right at all to blindly think that Classic is the absolute best version of WoW and anything after is downhill garbage. Im most excited for TBC and WoTLK where I feel Blizz improved their game. Theres tons like me who are able to enjoy Classic for what it is but be more excited for the potential future.
---
Is mind flay now suffering pushback even while in power word shield?
---
Typically yeah. Thorium point is considered to be a no-go at peak hours as the entire path from there to BRM is patrolled by horde groups, including the FP itself. 
---
Usually you can at least get to the mountain on the Burning Steppes side before getting camped
---
Now how did Org look like in 2006 when the queues were popping? I remember it being just as packed as today.
---
I havent gotten to the point of kicking people, but I do now accept that most players are probably just watching netflix on their second screen. Why watch or even DL a threat meter when regardless of anything, you will spam that cleave and blade fury--do we need blade fury considering youre only going to get like a fraction of its uptime? (No, but may as well pop it to frustrate the tank.) 
---
Another big thing Ive noticed is stuff like skipping packs--I ran DMN for the foror book for a while, you can skip tons of dog and ogre packs. However, pretty quick youll notice people either half heartedly jumping onto the ledges or flat out bumbling right down the middle pulling everything. At first I had hope and just ran straight to the next part. Then I had caution, waiting just after doing the path myself to show the group, in case they messed up and I had to pick up the pack. But finally, I had acceptance, and I now just pull extra packs so that I can do a clean pull rather than the half-assed one the random PUG will cause.
---
Lost what again? I’m sorry I haven’t been paying close attention to you
---
yes, no worries.
---
Herod is a little more balanced I think, Alliance regularly controls BRM and ganks everyone coming out of Mojache to DM.
---
Saves the whiny asshole guy from wasting time replying. So not a bad courtesy.
---
Hey relax, it just dungeons, were not running MC let's just get this over with
---
I dont, noone does. That server happens to be the only one where horde players come here to whine.
---
I follow suit with whoever pushes the first button
---
I generally trust my group to not be whinging assholes, and even if they are oh well what's 100g of WOWBucks© anyways, not the end of the world
---
Its funny how wrong you are because you didnt understand the original statement.
---
Very cool, very edgy.
---
Just report them, the devs have kicked people off roofs and balconies in south shore, gadzetgan, and booty bay. This falls under terrain exploiting, and they don't need to actually use it to attack people simply being there is enough for a warning.
---
But people were corpse camping before honor was put into the game....
---
When the bindings drop you see just how real these *leaders* are.    
---
I'm looking at you GMs who play rogues and GMs who's RL friends with an off tank or rogue.
---
Do it yourself.
---
classic threat plates are great:  wonderful for any class, be sure to set your role (dps or tank) in the addon settings.
---
Sometimes I'll do 2 to 3 runs with no resists and some runs I'll resist 3 times in a row.
---
Came to see "chucky" comments, was not dissapoint.
---
&gt;THEY'RE wasting THEIR reagents.
---
what is the difference between mh and offhand? Some skills like ambush or so? I have Wingblade (from rogue quest) MH
---
All those things make the game harder, which in turn makes it more rewarding. The most valid issue on your list, in my opinion, is wpvp on imbalanced servers (see: that descent into hell video).
---
&gt;Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.
---
He portrayed himself in a negative light, therefore his name must be blurred.
---
I wrote to you:
---
&gt; you can remove honor gain from player below your level 
---
to which you answered "don't get honor from killing grey" and missing the point (a lvl52 is below lvl60 and grants honor) but ok you didn't read well, it happened so I precised:
---
&gt; I'm obviously talking about getting honor from lvl48-59 when you're 60
---
and again you're speaking of 'grey level'
---
So... at this point I can only conclude that you're not reading.
---
Vanish just fails like 25% of the time. Once I blew prep and both vanishes failed on the same pack.
---
Fun times.
---
Unsub.
---
I put two months into getting a warrior to 60 and almost 100% raid geared with an epic mount and maxed professions with a decent bit of honor.
---
There are other games, other things to spend literal hours of my life on and $15 a month to save or spend elsewhere.
---
It's not worth putting in another two months just to get back to where I am on a server that doesnt suck.
---
Check the comments, where we have discussed exactly what you're saying here. I'd honestly say this is far from a shit post, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the (enjoyable) comments left around inciting thought and discussion.
---
Can you read? It literally says that each LAYER holds the population of an entire vanilla server. There are multiple layers on each server.
---
Yeah this really sucks for the minority of horde on alliance dominated servers.. y’all really do have it rough :/
---
Gripe filter to filter out whining.
---
Meme filter to filter out memes.
---
Harsher penalties on repeat posts.
---
Yeah the queue time probably won't be that bad for the Horde due to cross realm BG's. In retail it's 5-10 minutes for the Horde and a minute or two for Alliance.
---
Not everyone cares to gank the same person 4 times a day
---
&gt; I'll clarify it for you because you seem to really be struggling with this concept.
---
There's no need to be pedantic here friend. I'm not struggling with any concepts, I'm just expressing just how I view spending time while playing games, you just have a different notion, that is all. 
---
&gt; People are fine with spending their time to have fun.  
---
I totally agree with you here, anyone would.
---
&gt; The person you are replying to called it "wasting" time because someone suggested he literally log out of the game and spend an extra minute to do something that benefits himself in no way and is not fun.
---
A couple of points regarding this:
---
1. Maybe I am misinterpreting what he meant by wasting time, whenever *I* ever feel like I am wasting time while playing games, I shouldn't be playing for starters. Worrying about time while playing is meaningless to me.
---
2. If you're not having fun, stop and take a break for a while.
---
&gt;  You can have all the free time in the world with no responsibilities and relogging for the sole purpose of denying the enemy honor would still be a waste of time.
---
That is just how you and others might feel about it, it's not an absolute. It also seems very illogical to me having all the free time in the world while also worrying about wasting it.
---
Wild thought but, Artwork sounds like a good tag.
---
Sticking everyone's complaints under a single flair that everyone can just filter out? It seems both unproductive and heavy handed to me. If everyone just filters out the "whiner" thread, then how does the game/meta receive any criticism? Everything needs criticism. That's how any scenario gets better.
---
So you actually WANT to be less like r/wow now?  For the first few months of Classic r/wow and r/classicwow were butt buddy subs, even sharing the same moderators and sharing bans and punishments between the subs.
---
Back in TBC I earned gold for my level 40 mount by fishing the debris pools off Dustwallow Marsh and Tanaris. You can fish up lockboxes that contain leather, bolts of cloth, gold and random greens/blues. 
---
I spent four days fishing and only returned to Ironforge to list my auctions. I think I made the majority of my gold off bolts of mageweave and runecloth.
---
I've tried to explain this to parties before, they won't listen, and insist everyone has to be out...
---
Easiest way is to just have the leader pop out, reset, and go back in first while everyone else waits in the old instance, then everyone else just needs to pop out then in, done.
---
Idk if I have to say well played or cancer
---
Your level of aggression is trully uncalled for, but I'll answer just to give you the pleasure of knowing I took some time in my life to think about you!
---
I figured the random capitalization of letters would indicate a mocking tone yet here you are
---
/duel you noob
---
The problem is taking a picture with your phone instead of taking a screenshot with your computer.
---
I mean he's not totally wrong but I would at least train up all your skills.  Even frost mages use fire blast, a lot of arcane spells, and flamestrike
---
Thrash blade is no joke
---
Which Surface Pro are you using?
---
jUsT rErOlL, gO tO rEtAiL
---
Ban low effort content.
---
You definitely don’t need 40 before a raid unless you are the only warlock in the raid and half the raid is asking for summons.
---
Enforce rule 7, there's several "memes" everyday that fall under rule 7 "low quality meme" but stay up for days.
---
While leveing an alt with both Herbalism and Mining i got tired of using the swapping macro and tried my hand at creating my first addon.   
---
I therefor present you TrackingSwitcher, the addon that while active will swap between "Find Herbs" and "Find Minerals" every few seconds while out of combat
---
laughs in PvE server
---
This quest was a complete nightmare lol, and sadly totally not worth it. The only way I completed was following the guide step by step. And at the end, I thought the helicopter wasnt showing up... I kept waiting and after a few minutes it finally did.
---
It is always beneficial to get rid of frost nova, it should be the first thing you dispel when against a frost mage.
---
I don't see a problem with a 52 granting honor to a 60.  Two 52s can conceivably kill a 60.  Grey is a decent compromise.
---
Keep whining though.
---
Me that kind of orc.
---
Also I love that inn music man. Best music in the game, change my mind.
---
I will stick around if my effort is rewarded. I’ll never whine about not getting loot tho. But I will leave if I feel like I’m not getting anything in return for my commitment.
---
Yes. Feared mobs will likely run into other mobs and aggro them. It is widely understood that you should never never never fear in a dungeon. That’s the quickest way to wipe
---
The honor system is lazy design that enables griefing.
---
F
---
They are very good. Entry level farming is probably farming Maraudon but once you get gear, you can start soloing DM:East for lots of cash.
---
my GM is a Warlock, i've been his DPS officer/Rogue Lead for over 10 years and I am not getting TF (I don't want it, give it to a tank).
---
They will supplement their honor between games if they have a queue, but in vanilla and I hope in classic you can't take a queue while you are dead or in combat, so if you go out on your own and run into some trouble there is a risk you can miss your queue.
---
It all depends on what spec, I assume you're leveling as Combat in which case you'll want a slow (2.0 or higher speed) weapon in your main hand because your yellow attacks (sinister strike, repost, etc) use your main hand damage.  The reason you ideally want a fast off hand is to get as many poison procs per minute as you can.
---
If you're leveling as daggers the same thing holds true but typically you wont find a dagger slower than 1.90 or so.
---
My Classic wow experience in a nutshell...
---
Yeah I wouldn't recommend making any kind of keyboard macro that does more than 1 thing.
---
I started off trying split between dps/heal, but I’m learning more and more that healing really requires many talents specifically for it. I tried healing for RFZ around 40 and failed miserably, lol. Now leaning into a dps/tank build since tanks are typically in high demand when LFG.
---
Most serious players have a supply of lotus/flasks already
---
I was honestly surprised that he only got one bite. It wasn't exactly subtle.
---
100%
---
I don't know of anyone who would have the wherewithal to level a *bank alt* to 40.
---
Perhaps an alt that they ditched for a new main....
---
Totally this.
---
when i press "o" and raid then i cant press raid info cause it is grey,does that mean i am not locked ?
---
Was in your situation a few weeks ago, and can say with about 4 runs under my belt heres what I saw:  
---
1. You'll want at least 30 shards. On a lot of trash pulls you'll need to get shards too. Make sure you have room in your bags - you won't need much other than some trinkets/gear you might swap. 
---
2. Make sure you have major healthstones. People will reeeeeee if you don't. During down times between pulls ask if anyone needs cookies in chat - make sure your warriors and tanks always have them. 
---
3. You may be told to soulstone a specific person, or you may just be expected to have it on a priest. Make sure you understand who should have a soulstone. 
---
4. Make sure you have both rank 2 and rank 1 banish on a bar. During several trash pulls you'll be given a rank 2 banish assignment. Depending on your raid's strategy, you may be told to rebanish at rank 1 periodically. 
---
5. Unless otherwise stated do not cast corruption or any curses. Since you're joining in now, curses are probably all spoken for. There's no reason to cast CoA, as there's a debuff limit. You're pretty much focused on shadowbolts.
---
Yeah, the guy camping the FP sure does. But we are talking about the guy who happened to be running by or going to take the FP and tagging the player for partial honor, and then the dude who was camping the FP going out of their way to talk shit in whispers because they care way too much about min-maxing honor.  I am just explaining to you that the person who "ruined your honor farm" doesn't care anyway near as much as you do about how much honor the kill gives. You need to take a chill pill, bud.
---
There are free transfers from all the big servers?
---
They're supposed to, under Rule 7, but the mods here aren't good at actually enforcing the rules.
---
I really appreciate a thoughtful comment like yours. While some discussion that have arised were truly wonderful to read and participate on, a lot of the comments are quite negative, to say the least. And I fail to understand what wrong fiber I touched from their body to react in such an exaggerated, offensive way.
---
In the end, it's food for thought as you said. We probably won't solve the world, but we might as well think about it.
---
NOCHANGES EXCEPT UPPING REALM MAX POP BY 3-4x THE OLD VANILLA AMOUNT AND THEN RELEASE PVP SYSTEM BEFORE ANY BG AND EXPECT IT TO BE OK.
---
thinking Blizzard actually implemented their feedback pepelaugh. you must be new to Blizzard
---
Ah yes, the "shooting all these fish in a barrel is giving my trigger finger a blister".  You kill at the flight path because you are not looking for a fight, you are looking for easy kills.  You don't want a challenge, you just want to get your honor and leave.  And then when you get camped or your gank fails, you get extra salty because, "How dare they deny me my honor!"
---
I find it fun to fuck with people like you.  Mages in towns, attempting a quick shatter combo for an easy kill or a rogue trying to stunlock those who land.  I will ride past the warrior struggling to kill an NPC and make it my goal to cause you to take durability loss from the guards.  After all, being denied honor doesn't hurt nearly as much as making you repair repeatedly because you keep getting blue balled by a 59 priest.
---
You should have at least 10, and I never carry less than 20. A lock with no shards is a sad life, especially with pvp now.
---
Always give the pat the nipple.
---
Oh okay, I get you. Someone else just pointed that out coincidentally. Sorry, I misunderstood what you meant initially :)
---
that's just more time wasted rather than getting to do something in-game.
---
Yeah they seem to like that. They do it 24/7 on gandling.
---
I firmly believe that just like in vanilla, the people who enjoy the game the most........ are the casuals. who just play the game
---
Anyone who is hoarding anything is dumb.  Prices are going to go *way* down.
---
Name a commodity and it's price has already dropped.  For example, Essences of Water went from 26g to 12g in the last month.  All the herb prices have gone down ~20s *per*.  Why?  Shouldn't it be *harder* to farm now that P2 is out and gank squads are all over the place?
---
The answer is yes, but you also need to appreciate the fact that all wealth in WoW ultimately derives from time spent looting money and vendoring dropped items.
---
People aren't doing either of those activities nearly as much as they were during the pre-BIS dungeon spam crunch.  Each time a zone is released - BGs, BWL, ZG, AQ - the player base spends *less* time in dungeons generating wealth and more time simply raiding.  The money they do make from boss drops is enough to afford their repair bills and not much else.
---
This means the currency in the game will deflate heavily in the coming months.  There will not be a huge influx of new players still running dungeons and killing mobs to generate enough wealth to sustain current prices.
---
So - sell your stuff now.  Trust me.
---
You shouldn't
---
I have tried the Silithus tunnels for arcane crystals but I find it hard to find RTV spawns and when I do, I seem to struggle to get to mine them due to aggroing all the mobs in the area. 
---
BRD I know is guaranteed money but I really really struggle to keep going as I get resisted an awful lot. I haven’t died it just annoys me, but these 2 are my only real choices as my sever is a complete gankfest. I doubt I’m going to get my epic mount any time soon!!
---
Killing someone for a vein or herb is the only reason I would gank someone lol I don't care about honor but I'll fight to the death for that rich thorium or black lotus node. 
---
I only wish i could fight my own faction sometimes, still salty about the time I fought off two enemies for a black lotus spawn and a fellow horde rogue swooped in and took the node while I was still in combat.
---
Correct, if there is no raid info you are not locked to any instances.
---
This is automating gameplay.  Idk how an addon can do it but blizzard should break it as it's against their tos.
---
As an Alliance player on a PvP server I spend most of my time in the Shadowlands anyway, running back to my corpse and looking at that black whirlyswirl in the sky. I believe I've already had my fill of that setting.
---
&gt;  My suggestion that's the pserver team who got invited to Blizzard office fault, since pservers pop was around 8-10k concurrent so they have managed to persuade Blizzard it's fine.  
---
source on any of that at all? lmao
---
Get a soul bag and just keep it full. I go through so many shards its insane to me how sone of these people are saying just carry a couple.
---
For mages, PvE weapons aren't particularly special until Chromaggus Claw &amp; Shadow Flame staff. The AB rep dagger is just 10 damage less than a Mageblade, though it may be a few months before having access to that.
---
I'm leveling a priest now alongside my shaman and druid, looking for some advice on a good talent spec for the priest. On all my chars, I like the build to be reasonably leveling-friendly, but mainly focused on talents useful for world pvp while leveling. Builds I encountered online do not take into account any interest in pvp and just go for max leveling speed, which isn't my goal.
---
Deviate fish for alliance is around 20s each which is the best I've seen so far. Don't need pools (you can fish anywhere in those lakes in Barrens), you won't get ganked, and don't need high level fishing. Worth as much as blackmouth and stonescale but much less effort and easier to collect.
---
As an alchemist, you can make them even more valuable as a savory delight or elixir of giant growth (50s+ each).
---
Blizz has never actually published the server cap, so there is nowhere to pin a lie on them. They have said very few things about the classic server caps, and they contradict each other. 
---
You have one saying the layers will all be vanilla server capacities, heavily implying that when layers went away we would have vanilla caps. But it is never directly stated there. 
---
Then you have other posts saying that the servers have many times more people on them now than they did in actual vanilla, but that seemed to be talking about overall characters made, not concurrent players. Again, no numbers, and nothing directly stated other than "The servers are bigger now when you look at the low/med/high/full tags" If this only refers to the number of characters total then there is no confusion, but if it means larger concurrent caps then the two statements are at odds. 
---
Since they will never tell us all we have are addons and the way the servers feel. They feel overfull, and even the most packed original servers didn't have these sorts of issues. Perhaps it is an issue of people in the world who otherwise would be in instanced pvp content if it were available, but we have no way to get real numbers. Either you believe the census addons or you don't, proof will never be provided.
---
Absolutely.  I've been playing WoW hard since release.  Ever since WPvP has released, I find myself playing less and less.  No. It's no fun taking me 30 minutes to get into DME just to farm.  That's almost half the time I had dedicated to play.  It's ridiculous.  Give us "Carebears" an option to turn the PvP off.  Maybe a "Diplomat" tag, to make it RP friendly or something.
---
The most rude awakening to me was the private server community.
---
I have seen alot of shit in my 15 years of wow, but the PServer community takes toxic gameplay to another level.
---
You can feel the psychopathic traits through your screen.
---
The hit ring is wonderful, but as for shields, no warrior really uses one when solo leveling past level 30 or so. Having full plate armor really helps though.
---
Yea it's a pretty decent chunk too. Did most EPL quests as a 60, typically got around 3 to 4+ gold as reward. Did the same quests a week later on my lvl 59 and the rewards were 0 to 30 silver lol.
---
If you are farming something then it's a different matter. I ment more if you are not.
---
We have more rogues than mages or warriors though
---
In fact, weapon skills are set to the current players max possible level during pvp combat.
---
&gt;Can we start removing your comments for being off topic?
---
Of course, if my comment is not adding value it can be flagged for removal and removed. That's literally moderation at work. 
---
&gt;I would love to know how the time between post and comment is relevant. I'd guess the comment came a few minutes after the mod saw the post. Or, it started discussion internally among mods and this comment was the result. Regardless, irrelevant.
---
You're using the fact that a post generated conversation as a benchmark for whether or not it's worth keeping around. Any thread will do that if given enough time, so it's a horrible metric to go by. 
---
&gt;&gt;somewhere in the comments section 4 hours later after much back and forth Bob and Tim scientifically disprove the OPs point doesn't mean it was a good post
---
&gt;What exactly is this example and how is it relevant?
---
&gt;A more relevant example:
---
&gt;somewhere in the comments section 4 hours later after much back and forth Bob and Tim scientifically cure cancer \[or anything positive for the community\], it was a good post and useful.
---
No, it's not, see my previous comment. 
---
&gt;&gt;Whining/complaint threads such as this are low effort. A meme with an unmodified caption is low effort. It generally refers to shitty one liners and jokes that don't really harbor or facilitate further discussion.
---
&gt;Great, agreed. What's your point?
---
That these are the types of posts/content that ought be removed and that simply because our back and forth or a mods post soliciting feedback exists does not make the post worth keeping around.
---
If given enough time, even a thread titled "this place sucks I'm leaving" can have thoughtful discussions occuring underneath it. 
---
Doesn't mean that post should exist long enough for that to happen.
---
Spell Power flasks for those Arcane Shots.
---
This is a fact.  And if you aren't a druid or shaman, youre even more boned.
---
I try to keep an eye on healer mana, it is only mana that matters. Tbh I get nervous that people will think I am going too slowly so that is why I sometimes go quicker. If you do not go quickly enough then DPS can start trying to pull and it all falls apart
---
Im hiding only no-cooldown abilities or The ones i dont use often
---
its cleaner imo
---
A lvl 48 is low level to a lvl 60 (geared in epics), but still gives honor.
---
Has dropped back to back Onyxia kills for us.
---
I do not.
---
&gt; Backstab uses 60 energy. Should I buy more thistle tea as compared to hemo? How does the play style differ in general? 
---
I don't neccesarily think so. Dagger rogues has more burst without tea than hemo IMO, I don't think you become more reliant on using it. However the burst you can do as a dagger with tea/zg trinket is fucking crazy.
---
&gt;Do I **ever** need to use SS? *Example: I am at 10% and rooted in front of a target at 25%. I SS to grab the fifth cp so I can Cold Blood/Evis for the finisher*
---
Yeah sure. This scenario i would def. use sinister.
---
&gt; Which daggers should I get for pvp? Can I buy the lobotomizer right when AV comes out? 
---
Preferably a MC dagger. Gutgore is a great weapon and has relatively low competition. But yes lobotomizer is quite good well though you need to get some AV rep first(I believe it's revered) should take you like maybe 4-5 hours of AV? You need to grind it anyway.
---
&gt; Which classes do I open with Ambush? Do I ever use cold blood with ambush or is it not worth it? 
---
Mages typically. Not always. I would recommend going imp sprint over coldblood, but if coldblood either use it to secure ambush crit if you need immediately burst, or use it for evis. Ambush also works great as a re-opener, since players often are DR'ed from your first CS(15 seconds timer remember!)
---
&gt; What rotation do you use solo against mobs? During down time can I farm Essence of Water easily as backstab build or am I going to have trouble? 
---
Honestly equip your swords and use sinister.
---
What about with a script?
---
I think this was the main problem most people (like myself) who rolled on PVP servers are now experiencing.
---
Before the layer squish, it was actually difficult to tell just how bad the faction imbalance was and how many players were on your server since it was obviously limited to the layer you were currently on. So, even though the faction imbalance existed, it was artificially controlled by layering. 
---
A ton of people were able to finish their 60 grind by the time layers were merged, and given Blizzard's lack of transparency, i.e, how many layers are there on my server and how many players are on these layers, made it a difficult task to gauge just how your server would be when layers were removed.
---
Now, after the layer squish, we see just how bad it really is and now that we've sunk tons of our time into the game, we're told that we should have expected this exact outcome. 
---
How could a normal player who didn't do private servers have expected this outcome? The current situation is outside of the scope or frame of reference that a non-private server player could have imagined. 
---
Saying, "you should have expected this" is like asking someone if they know what ten thousand dollars is, then asking them to imagine ten thousand dollars in one dollar bills crammed into a 3'x3' box. It's impossible for most people to conceptualize who hadn't already stuffed a 3'x3' box with ten thousand, one dollar bills.
---
First link in Google https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-09-nostalrius-team-meets-blizzard-and-says-company-wants-legacy-wow-servers
---
I suggest using a 40 shadow damage green boe robe for pve, and a dreadmist, necropile, felheart or rank 8 robe for pvp.
---
Hey, at least it's a slightly different complaint.
---
The one with the psycho?
---
Yeah, it's just a grenade, I meant like an actual long range mortar.
---
This right here. I'm level 53/54 (somewhere in there) on my orc Hunter and was grinding in Un'Goro. Some level 55 rogue kept trying to gank me but it was painfully obvious they had no grasp of the mechanics, despite being lit up with enchants and fancy gear. 
---
After about the 3rd or 4th time of me easily killing them they apparently thought they needed to come gripe on the Horde side in General Chat. 
---
It did not end well for them.
---
One week previous to launch this sub was a nice community where everyone got along. Now it's extremely polarizing and people seem to be constantly at each others' throats because of this game.
---
I miss when we could just post whatever and laugh about things. Now it's just a constant circle jerk about how the Horde is filled with petty man-babies and how the Alliance is filled with clueless idiots.
---
I haven't been browsing so much recently because I genuinely feel bad when players make openly general statements about how the Horde is filled with a bunch of useless no-lifers who sit around all day killing Alliance and how we are ruining the game. It's honestly a bummer, and because of that, I have been browsing a lot less. Faction imbalance is a problem, but it's not anyone's fault. The reality of the matter is that a lot of players couldn't handle PvP squads and they bailed on their server to go play on PvE or another server that favors their factions (or at least is more balanced), and thus, we now have realms that are way out of balance.
---
As much as I like faction pride, I think it's something we need to keep in the game, and out of this sub. Just remember that everyone else here is just a human being who wants to enjoy a game that they genuinely love. I hate that people are saying such awful insults to each other when they don't really even know the other person. It's just a really toxic environment.
---
I also see a lot of downers infiltrating this sub to complain about the game and talk shit about us who enjoy it. I really think that there should be rules against people coming here to openly blow hot gas all over our fun because classic isn't what they want it to be. Posts about how classic sucks and how retail is so much better have been popping up more often and we need to protect ourselves from it. I would hope that the reason most of us are still subscribed here is because they are playing and enjoying the game.
---
The fact of the matter is that there just is not very much to talk about. This game has already been played. We already know what we are doing. There is no strategy to discuss nor is there really any content that we haven't seen before. I don't want to see pictures of players getting their mount, or hitting 60, and I especially don't want to see pictures of people's cats - it just isn't interesting to look at. But on the other hand, what else is there to post? Not much.
---
It seems like people have taken this sub as a place to file their grievances with each other and with the game, when in reality, I think the official WoW forums are better suited for that.
---
I don't know what to do to make this sub a better place, I just know that it involves treating each other with some more respect, and to stop placing blame on others for their lack if enjoyment.
---
That's all, really. I'm still here because I love this game and this community. It breaks my heart to see fellow players so divided and angry with each other. 
---
This is not the WoW community I want.
---
&gt; I am in no place to tell people what to do, or even to judge how they spend their time
---
Yet here you are literally saying that it's *immoral* to play a video game a certain way.
---
The world is made up of individuals. Individuals are not all guilty of the behavior you describe. Therefore as an individual your behavior has no ability to affect that of the masses. It's out of your control.
---
What you're doing is the same fatal judgment error that led to the subjugation and slaughter of millions of humans during the 20th century. Down with groupthink, down with this idea that we are all one conglomerate. Down to hell where it belongs with the idea that we are guilty of what our neighbors or relatives do. Fuck your collectivism. I am an individual.
---
Well actually it was in the first rule of football in 1848 that you couldn't punch people:
---
"In no case is holding a player, pushing with the hands, or tripping up allowed. Any player may prevent another from getting to the ball by any means consistent with the above rules"
---
So I get your point but I note they immediately saw the needs to make rules against things that were detrimental to the game because... 
---
Well if 10% of the people playing soccer threw punches and referees were adamant about the fact that it's within the rules would the problem really be those players throwing punches or the lack of updates to the rules? While we can answer 'maybe both' one thing is clear: you can update the rule in one night, changing the mentality of thousands of players is almost impossible.
---
Have you seen fadeleaf prices recently?  It's gone up over 100% on my realm since phase 2.  It's used by rogues for blinding powder and for invisible pots,  as well as GSPP which people are starting to stockpile for BWL.
---
Fair enough, I guess i just enjoy stocking bank alts
---
No 23 spellpower is the 2 piece on the rare set, you might've looked at the epic set since the bonuses are reversed for that one. I just checked ingame to be sure.
---
Deud, your videos are epic and I look forward to the next one every time! Thanks for sharing your talent!
---
I had one Naga in Azshara drop an epic belt once, and another dropped an epic 1H axe. Definitely worth farming.
---
Have you considered that Alliance players can't play with their friends or guildmates the way things are?  No, of course you haven't.
---
Alliance players are either not logging on anymore, or they're just straight up quitting.  When they do log on, they're able to stand in IF together and that's about it.
---
Will there be some disruption to the Horde?  Yes of course.  That's the point.
---
Those Horde guilds and groups of friends will have options to continue to play together - either on a different server, or as Alliance due to a faction change, not reroll.
---
Thank you!
---
but why? havent you heard its a mEmE WeApoN that isnt good??? ^^^^/s
---
Until i get to know a person, i will treat them as a slightly above average intelligence child - Yes, i will remind them of very obvious things, but in a non condescending fashion, I will absolutely not get upset when they screw up or do something completely unpredictable, but i will also tell them that they are free to share any input they may have that i could do to make things better for them.
---
Sometimes children are in a foul mood, that doesn't make them evil bastards, it makes them children - with that image in my head, i don't get defensive or feel frustrated if i happen to get someone in my group who is offensive or angry.
---
Not axe of Deep Woods, the Frostbite axe from AV is just around the corner, better in everyway.
---
Not to mention the development team right now isn't the one that gave us Vanilla, its the group that gave us Battle for Azeroth -- yikes! I don't want nor do I trust those guys touching good WoW.
---
It isn't.
---
Still waiting for the option to transfer off Stalagg before playing.
---
You can probably make a weakaura for this.
---
Stonescale eels will be worth a lot more in a later phase. Stock up now
---
&gt; Willfully imbalancing the servers isn't a fix.
---
&gt; If you want to do PVE content and not be bothered by mandatory PVP, then PVE servers are for you.
---
I know the dagger rogues in my guild were discussing this build: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/30531310500135-302305200001-05 for PVE purposes.  I don't believe it becomes viable until later in Vanilla but yes a spec exists.
---
Why's he ganking afk alliance? Cuz he's PVE spec and cant kill people 5head
---
If you are herbalist and play late at night, fishing nightfin/grabbing ghost mushrooms on hinterlands isn't bad.
---
[Wowhead has 23 as the 6-piece bonus on the epic set](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=388/field-marshals-regalia), are you saying wowhead is wrong?
---
Can I apply my argent Dawn revered shoulder enchant to other people’s shoulders?  Like, if they put the item in the not-to-be-traded slot, can I enchant it?  Thanks for the answer!
---
SM/DS is best for PvE soloing and grinding gold.
---
\-hopefully you are arms axe spec
---
\-get plate armor so you don't die as quickly
---
\-dont fight mobs that are over 1 level higher than you. At most same level, but green mobs are preferred.
---
\-WW axe is fine at 44 as a horde. As alliance, you should be using Bonebiter now.
---
\-mortal strike and overpower should be your main skills along with battle shout continuously up. Use bloodrage and berserker rage all the time too. Always open with charge.
---
Not gunna lie I like this idea better than what they actually did
---
I can't believe this dude went from:
---
&gt;Why the attitude?
---
to
---
&gt; Ok white knight. Here is your block as well. Feel better? You defended a total douche, obviously you are a party favorite. Bye bye Felicia.
---
The lack of self awareness is staggering
---
But.. but you.. just added another complaint thread instead of.. just.. not.....
---
1v1 me brah.
---
Yeah I've got 60 already in the bank and growing.
---
I am that hunter and I am taking the TF from the MT to tank also.
---
Have you purchased new skills from your trainer?  Are you using a greater magic wand when monsters get in close or are going to die soon?  Why does your imp die, does he not have the right grimoires from the trainer?  You should be taking aggro off your imp in a few seconds with your corruption and shadow bolt or immolate.  Are you always summoning a healthstone when you log in and after using one for big pulls or when you accidentally pull?  Are you buffing your lock with the +armor self buff?  Is your gear red and you need to go to an armor smith or repair man?
---
&gt; No 23 spellpower is the 2 piece on the rare set
---
I was writing about the rare set since you wrote that only the boots are worth getting, maybe I should've made that more clear.
---
alternatively, open friends list, go to raid tab, and you’ll see a raid info tab there if you’re locked anywhere
---
Meh, you'll be slow af' if you have a shadow healing the later dungeons. Probably wouldn't be able to heal DM North, West, at all. But then again it all depends on gear and what kind of tank you have. Fury tank and shadow healer will not be a good time, any mispull would probably be a wipe.
---
If I afk’d and came back to that..
---
I'm talking about guilds that 10/10 MC with effort, not shit like BRUTALITY.
---
Hey I'm curious how getting locked out for raids or raid ID's work.
---
If I do a pug MC and we kill rag and get loot. when I join a different pug MC am I even allowed to walk in with them? Will I be put in my own instance from my old raid ID?
---
&gt; When amount active people playing on the server was 4x of vanilla cap, servers had layers.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Now this amount is back to the amount of people for high/full server in vanilla for most servers.
---
This is false for many big servers though
---
I'm not. And I don't have the time to start over, so I'm done until transfers are available. Which will perpetuate the problem for those left until they also quit. If only I'd had the ability to see the future as you apparently do.
---
They are definitely daft; they're saying that "transferring to PvE isn't a fix" then right after saying "well, transfer to PvE."
---
I have to assume they're just some dumb kid.
---
not sure what pve server has to do with this but fair play
---
You're correct on both counts, that's called Seal Fate Combat Daggers and it's not viable yet. So since he has coldblood, he is either a non-viable spec or he is PvP spec. Regardless, he is bad.
---
lmao
---
Don’t you have a flight path to camp? Or are you having more downtime lately since people are leaving in droves due to your shitty behavior?
---
I thought it was funny :(
---
Really not sure why this is downvoted, mostly likely because horde are babies lol
---
Jesus christ u can shut the fuck up now
---
Go back to retail if you want sims, parses and min max.
---
Literally all the raid content is easy as shit, and the best rogues will go dagger to dab on kid hordies such as yourself.
---
Pretty sure it has to attack. It seems that the chicken is a bit bugged right now in that it doesn’t follow you so you have to spawn it right on the mob for it to attack.
---
Always laughable when people who work at McDonald's ask "who uses email anymore" 
---
Oh you know only every professional industry on the face of the earth but no one really.
---
If you don't have them on yet, turning on enemy nameplates might be helpful. The default key is 'v' to turn them on. This way you can see which mobs are already taking damage by others and making sure your target is one of them. If you're having issues, don't rush to start DPS immediately. Take the time to make sure you have a good target before going ham or you'll keep doing accidental pulls.
---
L t A A F
---
You will not be able to join their pug in any way shape or form.
---
R A T I O.
---
96/4 is not realistic and not even supported by your own source. That many 60s did not vanish in 7 days and its preposterous to believe they did. Thalnos is a medium population server. Are transfers even an option for them?
---
For someone who hypes up data, you sure are bad at it. You're clinging to a narrative propped up by demonstrably inaccurate numbers. Which you accused me of. For someone who posts in "data is beautiful", you sure do fold into denial awfully quick.
---
So, make this subreddit a safe space for horde?
---
By 2 raids do you mean specifically 80 active raiders? Ascension runs 2 MCs and Onys a week.
---
They aren't 40 mans for sure, but we're running around 25-30 for each raid right now. I imagine a lot of people are doing that.
---
Ok I can agree he is bad, I was just trying to make a friendly joke ok ;_;
---
There's literally nothing about population caps or server size.
---
I spent .5mins trying to figure this out. 50 seconds I’ll never get back :(
---
I'm curious if there are rogue GMs out there funneling bindings to themselves or even non GM's funneling bindings to a rogue friend.
---
Whats the point in doing that when you'll be spending most of your time pressing feint? You'll generate way to much threat.
---
Is it an enchant you can only buy when you are revered? Or is it a recipe you bought at revered?
---
Because Blizzard massively underestimated the initial playerbase and massively overestimated the player dropoff? lmao
---
Curse of Agony is a good ranged puller because it have very little threat until later in its duration and will allow a VW, Succ, or FH to pull threat (even if it's only for a little bit). This will allow you to Corruption (and later siphon life) before it turns it's attention back to you.
---
there are atleast 4 guilds on our server only alliance side running multiple raids
---
I tried to make post some memes that got removed for rule 7. The moderation are a joke. My friend got perma banned for calling the holy light gay. Why do these type of people always get moderation?
---
Interesting, there's a talent bug that persists until logout, and disconnecting/restarting the game does not fix it, only a full logout (or a lengthy disconnect), so I figured a short disconnect doesn't really count, but seems it's enough for honorless, hmm.
---
Is it necessary?
---
If you have no one else to fill that spot? No.
---
If you have other people lining up on the bench looking to raid with you? Certainly.
---
ty
---
I swapped at 56. If you plan on healing at 60 just swap now. Get a feel for how the class works and do dungeons at the most optimal level you can. Learn your spells to use and get a lot of pre-bis, save a little bit of money on water, and probably prevent a few wipes you wouldn't be able to handle as shadow.
---
As a level 60 who enjoys killing low levels: it's posts like these that make it all worth while.
---
The most important levelling talents are spirit tap and wand specialisation. Nuke mobs to 50% then wand and you’ll rarely have to drink. Standard shadow spec is very hard to beat 1v1 but you can take improved dear and silence to make pvp even easier.
---
That's what I said doofus
---
Numbers only matter to dick waggers. I main a Druid, and while I’ll never top the DPS or HPS charts, I can do both. I’m releveling my original toon in Classic and have already had to save instance groups by picking up mobs off a dead tank, or healing the tank for the last few hits when the healer went OOM.
---
As long as the bodies hit the floor that’s all that matters. Too many people want E-Z mode speed runs these days. Whereas I’d spend 8 hours in Wailing Caverns to get the Fang armor, and loved every second. Even though we wiped a ton, had huge armor bills, and went through four healers.
---
The numbers are secondary to actually playing the game.
---
All for the "classic" experience, but in the era of modern communication, addons, etc how about we make the "honorless" debuff award a dishonorable kill. **That** would put a stop to the griefing real fast.
---
get at me on henhouse brah
---
Fair enough, I used to be pretty chill with enemy players but after this phase 2 shit mind goes right to attack like were in a battleground or something
---
&gt;You're using the fact that a post generated conversation as a benchmark for whether or not it's worth keeping around.
---
It is a factor, yes. There's actually an entire subreddit dedicated to similar posts. It's thriving and quite popular.
---
&gt; Any thread will do that if given enough time, so it's a horrible metric to go by. 
---
lol no. Sort by new, bookmark a few and check back later to see what positive conversations have occurred.
---
&gt;No, it's not, see my previous comment. 
---
Your irrelevant nonsense still doesn't explain anything.
---
&gt;Doesn't mean that post should exist long enough for that to happen.
---
Hate to break it to you, but the majority of voting members of this sub strongly disagree with you.
---
This is all so far off the original discussion it's not funny. There are multiple sides to whether or not to remove it and deciding on one can cause chaos for the mods.
---
except ring of spell power is bad for pve and ToeP is way better for pve than pvp were taking about pvp in this thread
---
Why not try it you already pay for it in a way I you have retail
---
Mob plates are the damn worst. I play a mage in Classic and need to move in sooooo close so I can identify which mob to ST.
---
I know, I *know*. I don't mindlessly AoE *all* the time.
---
You think you do but you don't.
---
For sure lots of people left, but nowhere near enough for what you're describing.
---
They spread out onto the multitude of new servers that were opened.  Go count the number on name reservation day and now.
---
The people also stopped logging in all the time.  Lots and lots of people were playing constantly the first few weeks, took time off work, etc.
---
Now they're all 60 with nothing to do except raid log or level an alt, so the engagement level is way down, meaning concurrent players is way down as well.  They haven't left, theyre just not online as much.
---
Ergo, smaller online pops.
---
What's really making their prophecy come true is the complete failure to properly manage server populations, result in this phase 2 idiocy.
---
Yeah I'm actually loving it.
---
I carry 72 + soulshards, 3 felcloth bags full. To furnish everyone in the raid with healthstones at any given time. I got geared pretty quickly subsequently, haha.
---
Go back to raid logging and pservers homie. No one likes you. I feel sorry for you. Hope it works out for ya.
---
Everyone plays peggle
---
another 'PvP happens on a pvp server' complain? \*yawn\*
---
Thank you for your insight, you're making a very interesting point here. I'd personally say I have a healthy relationship with the game, and I'm satisfied with my social interactions.
---
However, I cherish the sense of community in this game. And, judging by the ammount of posts regarding this, so does quite a lot of people. Thus, I believe it's in our hands to keep the community healthy by being critical of certain behaviours, realizing when we do right, and when we do wrong. WoW Vanilla was obviously laid out with community in its integral design, what good is ignoring the fact that by playing the game, you're essentialy being part of a whole, something bigger?
---
If what you're saying were true, everyone would ninja dungeon runs, for example. But people, even in these massive servers (in perspective), care for their reputation and how it may affect their gameplay; satisfying our base desires does have meaningful consequences.
---
Not with the script, and I find the script also fucks up the "queueing" that OP mentions so it's best to avoid using it when in a group.
---
Tabard
---
Can confirm
---
And you know that they expected that because?
---
If you're gonna go around spreading bullshit info, I'm gonna follow you around, Mr. r/Dataisbeautiful.
---
That means 669 of those players are Alliance. If 669 people is 4% of the server 60s alone, then holy shit! Thalnos is a massive fucking server! Except its Medium. So either every single Alliance 60 logs on Thalnos and a freakish amount of Horde don't, or your numbers are bullshit.
---
I think its a highly, highly flawed system and using submitted logs as a way to gauge ratios is better because there is no reason to believe one faction is far more inclined to log than the other. Also in the last 7 days it shows Stalagg as 63% Alliance which uh, yeah. Absolutely not.
---
Addendum: I suppose some high 50s could appear in these logs and not on the census, but the chances if it being more than a few dozen at most at this stage of the gane is remote.
---
give me that warlocks name right now. im going to kick him.
---
&gt; I personally think it's impossible
---
&gt;Like you'll have to "grind" honor for 4-8 hours a day 
---
4 - 8 hours a day is not that much if you're at all serious about the game. I work and go to school but WoW is my main hobby. Putting in 6 - 7 hours is nothing.
---
I rolled a toon on a PvP server because I have always played on PvP servers since my friends got me into the game in TBC.  
---
I LOVED world-PvP. I still do when it's balanced. If I am fighting 1v1 or even 1v2 It is exciting because I have to be smart about cooldowns and find ways to win or escape with my skin intact.  
---
But.. being on a server where the opposing faction has (literally) double our playerbase is making it a nightmare to do much of anything at all. Complaining about it feels silly because I know I chose a PVP server and the general sentiment is "you chose PVP you should have known better" but the thing is, is I didn't know better. I didn't know better because I have been playing since Burning Crusade on PVP servers and I have never, ever experienced sheer zerging on this level. I just can't comprehend how people find entertainment in sitting at BRM for hours and hours on end, standing still, waiting for an enemy player to appear to just explode them with their raid group and then sit there again.  
---
Every day I am feeling more and more like I should transfer.. but my Guild is full of amazing people that I can't leave behind and I feel as though going to a PVE realm would feel super bad. Small scale world-pvp is super fun and engaging so losing out on that would make everything seem too easy somehow..
---
I think this opinion is less true than people are willing to admit because it allows them to remain in denial.  They don't actually want to be on a PvP server, they just want the "street cred" for being on one. 
---
To further my point, let's assume they reduced the server cap and things improved slightly.  What happens when an expansion like TBC drops?  Everyone from the whole server is going to pile into one zone, just like it did years ago.  And all the people who hate world PvP now for all its issues are going to hate it just as much then no matter the population size. 
---
The truth is, they don't like PvP servers.   They made a bad choice, and for whatever reasons and excuses, they don't want to own that choice.  It's much easier to point the finger at the easy target, Blizzard.
---
What is the most crazy thing about it all is that we know from all our experiences with Blizzard that these problems aren't changing, but people still whine and complain like it will suddenly all will anyways!  It's the definition of insanity!  And this sub is currently the asylum.
---
I mean, you make it out like it's just a matter of opinion. The people who bitch about you going too slow because you're waiting for healer mana, and regularly pull off you on purpose because they figure they can tank it, are slowing the group down, not speeding it up. They are ***wrong***, simple as that.
---
Ah, I see. Yes, it looks like the 23 spellpower would make up for any difference besides the chest.  Still, just two pieces isn't going to have much of an impact on wPvP.
---
Warriors in vanilla/classic scale with gear. your gear sounds like it's prob pretty rough at this point if your weapon is any indicator. My first suggestion would be to start running instances as much as possible. RFD is solid around that level, you're about mid level for ZF ( it sounds like you're arms, spam sunder at enemies and cleave when you have extra rage) and once you hit 46 go over to Mara to get your staff then start doing princess runs for the ring and either the hammer she drops or the axe off Rotgore.   
---
Look over the loot tables, start building groups aiming for the gear you want as upgrades. Yes you're arms, but you can still tank. get a sword / board (don't try to 2-hand tank, it's a nightmare for your healers and you'll just get more aggravated).   
---
Places to spam   
---
Trade when you're in a city   
---
"LFM RFD, PST"  
---
Also join lookingforgroup, lfg, and world  
---
/join lookingforgroup to do so  
---
Spam the above when you're trying to build a group.   
---
I understand that you probably want to do damage, not tank. That's a mindset that has problems.   
---
First: Tanks are by far the most wanted members of a group, they're the hardest to find. If you START with that position filled it's a million times easier finding a group
---
Second: warriors don't want to bring other warriors in their groups. The reason is obvious, who wants to share gear. if you're an ally you have it even harder because paladins exist and shaman don't. I'd personally avoid taking dps warriors / dps paladins and be "iffy" on paladin healers. Everyone wants dps gear for soloing and if you're building the group you can be as picky as you'd like.   
---
Third: Learning to tank now preps you for tanking in the future. Classic/vanilla is a different game, tanking requires talent, it often requires leadership as well.   
---
So, this is longer than i meant it to be but base idea  
---
Do dungeons, get gear, move forward.
---
That looks to me more like a fury spec that is marginally worse in PvE and gains a lot more PvP utility. Honestly, I've though if doing similar with my build and going imp charge for PvP.
---
Turn off error speech god.
---
I used void walker from 10-12 and from 40-42, and that was about it.  I never bought a grimoire of torment except for at level 40 (and 60), because I had a free mount and wanted to see if he could hold aggro in feralas. Feralas had a lot of pvp and wanted a void walker summoned instead of a felhunter or sucubus.
---
I don't think it does backwards translations :(
---
Lol whatever you say honey. I’m the salt devil then 😁
---
only time i ever did this quest was when joana's guide walked me through it and it was a breeze, but lmao at this post for sure
---
60+ for raids- enough to never have to worry. Don't be that guy that runs out.
---
At 45 you should mostly just focus on gear with intellect for both ele and resto, so one set should work for dps and healing. Start looking out for any +spell damage/healing as you keep leveling
---
I think the confusion stems from the wording: "Increases damage and healing done by **up to** 20 spell damage" vs "20 Frost Spell Damage". One sounds as if it's a variable amount, and one sounds like a fixed amount, even though that is not the case.
---
But most of the game is played at level 60 where that's not a concern.
---
They actually did it with lotus at the same time as they did it with devilsaurs - when devilsaur respawn times were changed, lotus respawn also went from 2h to 1h at the same time. Presumably the respawns were 2h initially to make servers with 2 layers have as many lotuses as a 1 layer server would have in the future, so the reduced spawn timer was in preparation of removing the layers.
---
Damn, thought you wanted a 1v1 but I guess you didn't want that smoke
---
r/iamverybadass
---
You reskill to elemental now and become a healer late 50s.
---
I was grinding scorpions at 3am the other night (best way to avoid gankers) when I 60 hunter rolled up on me mid-combat. I was at 35% hp when I saw him coming. Hit em with a goblin rocket helmet, feared his pet, finished the mob, curse of elements Soul Fire crit, death coil fear dots, popped major healing pot and healthstone and embarassed him. I was level 57...
---
Does this count for something?
---
No other than RP
---
You guys are just pulling numbers out of your ass. If Blizzard actually would have expected for 90% of the playerbase to drop out before phase 2 they would have never ever even started to think about releasing classic.
---
&gt; Yup, I probably am misinterpreting what he meant by wasting time.  
---
The rest of your post is irrelevant. It's basically you failing to grasp the concept of an enjoyable activity being interrupted by things you don't like.
---
You will find.. I am kind..
---
can i get some basic tips how to play at onyxia lair as hunter?
---
As many as you need. Only you know the answer.
---
For myself: 
---
* PvP: every available slot after consumes and equipment.
---
* PvE: Exactly 5. One to summon your pet (to sacrifice), one to make yourself a healthstone, one to soulstone your PI priest, one to use shadowburn, and finally one to summon another warlock so he can summon everyone else.
---
You tried to shame the levels 60’s into not doing this but you’re too dense to realize you just add fuel to the flames with these kinds of posts
---
You never get black lotus on my server, even in Silithus at awkward times like 3 am and 6 am you have ~5-7 60's in the zone presumably mining or finding herbs. Plaguelands is covered by 10-15 people and all herbs are plucked (to the point western plaguelands herb farming is more profitable). 
---
At prime times gathering is impossible due to the 3-5 man roaming gank squads. Haven't seen a single black lotus since layering got removed. Prices of herbs are already shooting up right now slowly on my server.
---
have people stop posting about some statistic they think is going to make classic turn XXX into XXX after XXX
---
Just going to compound it, huh.
---
Spellpower is almost always better for dungeons and raid than int/stam.  So much that several true min/max BIS gear slots are shadow wrath green BOEs with no stats at all (ex. boots, cloak).  You should shoot for 350+ spellpower with +2% hit and +2-3% crit in full pre-BIS form and that will max your DPS, and wouldn't worry about stats until you hit that level. 
---
That said, if you get really deep on spellpower and crit and are ahead of your tank's gear and find yourself pulling aggro all the time you could potentially swap some pieces out.  Deadwalker mantle isn't horrible vs a BOE, for instance.  Green Lens w/+36 isn't horrible vs the *very* expensive +39-41 BOE hat with no stam. There are a few decent ~+14 cloaks with stats if you cannot get Gandling random enchant or a BOE with +20/21. 
---
The warlock discord has a couple simulator excel spreadsheets that will let you see your potential average DPS for a given fight length with different gear, etc.  It can help judge where to focus your time on gear farming.  
---
Once you get late game I think a few tradeoffs might be worth it for survivability and saving a bag slot.  Nemesis skullcap is not max DPS, but I wouldn't blame anyone for running it for PVE.  Felheart legs are just barely behind Skyshroud on DPS but survivability helps your total parse, too.  One unlucky death when Ony decides to fireball you twice in a row or Shazzrah teleports onto you and AE's you dead in 1.5 seconds and so much for worrying about that 0.5% DPS from the extra 10 spellpower vs getting 23 stam and perhaps surviving to continue the fight.  Again, I'd only make that trade off late game when you start getting raid gear.
---
What people have failed to realize is that we are talking about BWL here.
---
Half the time I do a run and the healers bitching at me for not pulling when he's at 60% mana cuz he's already drinking or some shit....
---
Typical pointed out your salt and you try to make it a me issue. This is all you. Grow up and accept responsiblity for calling someone out when they are wrong. My guess is you are a garbage human who does not own their mistakes. So suck my block.
---
It’s kinda funny how people who resort to such unintelligent comments are usually the no-life losers with zero social skills.
---
Ahh thats an interesting solution.
---
no, wrong
---
Yeah. I love those predictions. "MC will be so hard" "You need all worldbuffs and 300g of consumables per MC run" "It will take weeks for the first person to reach 60" "Keyring was always phase 2".
---
People are making vanilla seem harder than it actually was when in reality it was always "easy" by todays standards (both mechanics as well as gear reqs.). Outside factors made the game "hard".
---
Right but we still would've seen some decent delay previously, even once it starts hitting 5 to 10 seconds it's very notable. And I mean, yeah we don't but there are throttle limits in game for non custom channels already, and I'm sure they have throttle limits for their API (if not that'd be very bizarre?).       
---
And right, but if you set it to say half, it reduces the strain temporarily until you find a way to properly fix it. Or you simply make that part of the API protected where no add-on can call it as an extreme measure temporarily while you figure out the actual options. Not just sit back and hope things align to fix it.
---
Can confirm, who would even bother killing lowbies if they didn't cry so funny?
---
Alliance on skeram doing the same thing man. Rogue named Methknight in UC killing people at the bank all day the other day. Also alli rogue in BB named Aversion doing the same shit.
---
fax
---
Most of the supplies will be finished within a day and a couple will take a bit longer(purp lotus and med leather) due to limited ways to farm. But on mega-servers even those won't take long.
---
"Low pop" classic servers will still breeze through it though and it won't be a disaster.
---
This guys an absolute nitwit using hilariously broken numbers
---
I can help if you want man, I've got a ton of experience as a holy paladin in vanilla. Just lemme know
---

---
You also lose 20% of your total RP per week.
---
oh, yes, the nuance of wether or not you have time to CoC / fireblast ( the few non-fire immune mob in MC) before the mob die.
---
Sorry, I spent the last 5 years in mythic raids where 'nuance' in dps rotations actually means something.
---
Imagine being so bad at handling getting camped in a game that you need to write a 3 paragraph rant on reddit.
---
Right now for me the only thing that rewards anything extra is having greater fire pots on rag, anything else is optional and has no reward, which makes sense to me.
---
No it's boring as fuck because you have to wait constantly every single pull. It's also much much less time efficient.
---
That good quality Tug of war WPVP on Balanced servers 
---
All the ally will get insta queues and only ever do that and horde will burn their long queue times by continuing to wpvp.
---
Cross server lv60 BGs are a massive mistake.
---
I honestly think I'm not telling anyone how to play the game. I'm just inciting thought. After all, if as an individual my behaviour has no ability to affect that of the masses, why would I even try to tell them how to play? Why would you care that I did, anyways?
---
Please, don't make slaves and genocides. Now that would be inmoral... I'd like to discuss with you, but you seem quite set on your ideas and I'm no where near prepared to keep such discussion healthy and fruitful.
---
we're looking at 2-3x concurrent players on modern classic servers versus vanilla servers. that's significant
---
You probably would want to be on a RP-PVP server.
---
Just because the points system on this game is called "Honor". It does not literally mean that the most rewarding and satisfying wPVP is actual honorable duels. 
---
If you'd like to find honorable duels and roleplay for that, find a random guy your level in the open world and start emoting or something to show your intent instead of just ganking them while they are hitting a mob.
---
How very helpful of you.
---
Warlocks and spell damage. I started a warlock alt, I know that spell damage adds to single target spells like shadow bolt but does it help with DOTs? When leveling should I be using 2H staves or 1H and offhand?

Look at this pure unvarnished beautiful truth.
---
I'd like to add that with smaller server populations, even with imbalance as you've described it, you'll have the dominant faction camping BRM 15-20 people.
---
An UBRS group going to the instance has a chance to fight through that.  That's the kind of world pvp everyone wanted.  You knew you would have to fight your way to the dungeon, and you knew you could do it.
---
Not this 50 v 1 stuff we have now.
---
You can hold TAB and aim your screen at the mob you want to target.
---
The issue as currently is has existed from 3am to 7am server time since honor came out. They haven't yet and don't appear will be fixing people who got lower standing the previous two weeks as a result.
---
no, which quests?
---
&gt; hopefully will instill some sense of shame in those who derive their fun from running around and dotting grey levels with rank 8 spells
---
This is beyond nonsensical. Why would you think this might happen even a little? The *exact reason* those people gank lower level players is because they feed off rants like this. They want pissed off whining. They want to upset people. That's the game for them.
---
And you think a post here will do anything whatsoever?
---
That makes absolutely zero sense.
---
Flat healing isn't everything when it comes to PvP.
---
Most of the time, you're going to want to stack Stam and Int over raw healing.
---
So it was the Q3 shareholder meeting earnings call. Basically they lay out their plan going forward for products and while it wasnt explicitly said " we are releasing BC" it was strongly implied that the plan was to release classic content on years alternating with retail content, odd years. One can assume this means a re-release of the first 3 expansions of the game for a multitude of reasons the main one being they still have all the code for these expansions and the out of pocket cost to start a BC/WoTLK server is really low. Not to mention killing off other private servers running these game versions that are taking subs directly from Blizzard.
---
Classic+ is truly a pipe dream that from a business standpoint is the harder way to go with about the same expected payout and longevity as just releasing BC/WoTLK which were two of WoWs most popular time periods ever.
---
Making a new character and want to go PVE.  Tried Bloodsail Buccanners server(RP) but it is so quiet and finding groups for low level instances is horrible.   
---
Need a server recommendation - must be busy and preferably a healthy number of low level users to level up with
---
G o B a C k T o R e T a I l
---
I agree: Vanilla did a tons of things right but also a tons of things wrong. If you were to take the best aspect of it with the best aspect of TBC and WoTLK and rebooted the game to WoW 2.0, you could have such a good game.
---
(now of course there would be a lot of debate about what are the best part and which aren't)
---
Oh, look a reasonable rogue. I keep a list of DPS who think pulling and going balls out dps the second combat starts is OK. I leave groups when I join one with them, come on here and laugh at all the DPS that play like this crying about there being no tanks....
---
That's so crazy it just might work!
---
Does anyone know when the Christmas event starts?

sorry bruh dps has programmed us to PULL PULL PULL GOGOGOGO

I'm counting their hit, and they're hit capped at 9%. 
---
2% lionheart, 1% dragonscale set bonus, 1% bracers, 1% belt, 1% bow, 3% from axe spec.
---
Who knows if they picked the ring to meme. I saw a rogue in vanilla that picked the tank trinket.  It's sonodd since they sort of know what they're doing, but at the same time they don't.
---
Probably getting lost in all the other undead mounts :P
---
The tiers weren't limited to just one prior to 1.12, they were just smaller.  The top bracket went from like top 0.15% to top 0.3%.

I'm not going to hold your hand and tell what you need to do. There's a lot of people this time around who just looked up what to do, how to play, or watched someone do something and claim its best way. Want everyone to play the game for you and you just copy/go through the motions? Why not figure it out on your own?
---
 My point is that Mara isn't very efficient anymore without a constant supply of people wanting the ring so don't bother. Take that how you want.

**Confirmation bias**
---
Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that affirms one's prior beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched beliefs.

What are you talking about? Nothing stops them from lowering the cap to vanilla levels of 3k, it will just result in queues and more transfers to less populated servers.
---
Wtf did I just watch?
---
Are any kind of public opinion polls worthless because they don't poll every single person?
---
That's how Ironforge works. It won't determine raw numbers but there's no reason to question the ratios outside the standard margin of error.
---
Ty
---
They're just that good at it.
---
Not trying to discredit you but do you have a source for this information? Judging by prices around the time of delayering, no one was aware of this.
---
My guy, he's a baby 1 year
---
no one to play with :(
---
For me, MC is already kind of boring and I want to clear it quickly.
---
A good raid comp saves time.
---
Evasion + blade flurry.  You can burn down packs and barely take any damage.  By the time evasion has worn off not much will be left of the pack.  The lock or mage will have pulled aggro by then anyways lol
---
Not only that but all 5 man content is piss easy.  There's literally no reason not churn and burn everything.
---
So why have you guys not started a 2nd raid group?
---
Be very aware that you may be making a classic newbie mistake of rolling on a PvP server.
---
You're late. There are a lot of bored 60s. When you are trying to level up, you'll be feeding honour for enemy players, and there won't be a lot you can do about it in the open world.
---
On the other hand, on a PvE server, you can type /pvp and flag up for action when you want it.
---
Don't make a classic mistake, or we'll see you when you're level 50 or so claiming the game is impossible to get to 60 except by hiding in instances.
---
&gt; Do you think it would be worse for the game if that happened?
---
Probably considering people would find a way to exploit it. It seems like a half thought out idea at best.
---
&gt;Or are you just afraid of a slippery slope?
---
I'm just not in favor of creating systems that don't really provide any added benefit beyond satisfying complaints. 
---
If someone is ganking you, add them to your KoS list and get them whenever you see them, you don't need a debuff/honor to do that.
---
If you're  combat then you probably want to use the Battlesmasher.
---
SM/ruin is a fine balance for pvp/pve if you don't want to respec.
---
Once your raid is geared up and just farm mode you could potentially stick with an SL build for raid night.
---
You can cancel the proc (by right clicking or with a macro), which makes it good.
---
At 44 though, either of the weapon drops from the last boss in Ulda is your best bet.
---
Winter Squid in Azshara, best rates between the hours of 12-6PM.  Just find yourself a spot that isn't near any resource nodes so you don't get ganked.
---
Lol.
---
No?  On Blaumeux Horde I know of at least 2 guilds with two raid teams currently.
---
Classic+ prob wouldn't work tbh. Classic already lacks skill requirements. Geared rogues, hunters, etc. already global people. When those classes are full Tier 3 pvp will be pointless for anyone with less than BWL gear and it's just gonna be a 1 shot fest. Add more content and gear with a lvl 60 cap without any "catch up mechanics" and the game is even MORE unbalanced.
---
One thing that really helped me when I was leveling my warrior is reading that I should be focusing on killing mobs and doing quests that are green/under my level a bit. Yea the xp is a bit lower, but you can kill a couple mobs at once or a ton in a row before you have to stop and eat/bandage. The slightly lower XP is more than made up for in the ease and speed at which you do things.
---
You’re the one getting mad bc your pretend plants don’t sell for more pretend gold...
---
Check census then. Max concurrent online for servers marked as overcrowded means it's roughly around the cap, especially if you can see a queue on this server still existing. For servers without queues their concurrent online IS their current size.
---
Op is definitely horde. The world was never that idyllic for alliance.
---
I’m on Herod alliance. We are severely outnumbered (some estimate 3-1) and I like the zombie survival esque environment as well as creating rivalries with the enemy faction through camping each other. 
---
You’re very close minded if you think I’m a sociopath.
---
Ban all the whiny children.
---
300th post of the day about "hurr durr new bug in the game my screen is always gray"? Ban that fucker. They aren't funny, they aren't original, they just flood the sub with their obnoxious complaints because they are too dumb to realize a high population pvp server is going to have a large number of people participating in pvp, and they suck so much at the game literally the only thing they have left is to come on Reddit and throw a tantrum.
---
Playing on Stalagg, Skeram, Herod, or Faerlina and complaining about the population? Ban those fuckers. They were pathetic enough to follow everyone else on Reddit to the "community (or streamer) servers", and now are reaping the benefits of playing with this "community" - which is having to deal with large amounts of players griefing in pvp because it's the only thing that makes them feel slightly accomplished in life.

Ban all the fuckers who think they have a right to demand Blizzard restricts access to the game for other players simply because they are playing on an over-populated faction that's dominating in pvp. The level of entitlement necessary to think Blizzard should step in and implement systems restricting player access because you suck too much at pvp is laughable.
---
The only way the above people get to circumvent their ban is if they offer an opportunity for actual discussion for whatever they are talking about, and aren't just making a post to cry about their miserable existence.
---
That right there would clean up like 95% of the trash on this sub. Problem is it's probably too late, as that's all the content this sub has had for weeks now. So anyone who actually wants to discuss things has probably left, and once you started banning the cry babies, their cries will be amplified because they're now also being banned.
---
Whatever will our poor children do when they are losing to pvp on wow classic *and* are banned from the one place they can go to throw their temper tantrums? 
---
We probably just need a new sub at this point.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted.
---
This is my favorite farm for two reasons:
---
1. No risk of competition or ganks.
---
2. **Most importantly**, super easy to do half afk, so I can watch shows/movies while I'm doing it.
---
That's not true. I'd faction change of I could to help the ally out.
---
DPS not drinking before a boss, especially the last boss, always pisses me off. You're at 60% mana, get to full before we pull the boss.
---
Those number aren't pulled out of people's asses, they're extrapolated from years of private server player data.
---
Yeah it's best for PvP and the recommended leveling spec.
---
We don't really know that for sure yet lol. AV beta looked very promising in AV premade honor, and yes you can premade AV with smart techniques.
---
Seems worth mentioning it's still worth it to spend the time getting exalted in AV (only takes a few days) for the vast majority of people first, though.
---
Outside of the super large servers, it’s was basically limited to one just based on that 0.15%. The super large servers could get a handful.
---
Not actually "many" but some. Blizzard issued several warnings about these servers, urging people to transfer. Those who haven't transferred yet still complaining about their server population being huge deserve nothing but a laugh or pity.
---
We already have rotating sticky threads that are heavily used; we have a few days open to add 2-3 more at best.
---
That what this sub has effectively devolved into -- nothing but alliance complaining about getting ganked.  It's been weeks since anything productive has been posted here.
---
Oh, you said 20 words or fewer.
---
but you’re the loser in this scenario.. especially looking up taunts you yell and macro
---
Regardless of if you think that amount of playtime is normal or not, it doesn't change the fact that R14 is far from impossible for many people.
---
Gatorbite is only good if you are roleplaying a character that can only use axes.
---
It is strictly worse than the mace off princess, the mace from ulda, and the sword from ulda.
---
What's the concern with the Daily Questions and WSIP Wednesday threads?
---
Calls people shitters, wont link parses. Big fucking surprise.
---
People are going to get absolutely shit stomped and camped by premades in WSG. 
---
It’s going to be a very rude awakening for a lot of people.
---
And then everyone wonders how retail wow ended up where it is today. The whiners complained about each and every inconvenience so the game slowly devolved into what it is today.
---
We are literally on our way to repeating the past without even realizing it. This will be especially true if they end up releasing BC then WotLK.
---
You must not have played a lot of WSG or AV back in the day. It was relatively common to get in an endless game where the enemy is farming you at your graveyard and you just have to leave, taking the deserter debuff. It will definitely happen again. And when it does your honor per hour gets absolutely destroyed making wpvp a much better option.
---
But to be sure we'll have to wait and see.
---
I think things will improve dramatically once BGs come out.
---
Thank you for your efforts regardless.
---
There is a big difference in 4 to 8. 4 could be pretty easily achieved by a lot of professionals. 8 would be much more difficult without sacrificing sleep with commutes and errands, etc
---
"He logged off and didnt come back because today is a new day and I'm still watching his corpse." 
---
lol who really is the loser here?
---
Neither, get Annihilator instead.
---
Have you ever seen this ?
---
Expecting people to willingly destroy the communities they built in a game totally centered around server community is a really dumb idea.
---
It's entirely blizzards fault for not including enough servers initially.
---
It goes off the original cast time of the spell you are using. Regardless if you use an ability like swiftmend to make it instant. Refer to the coefficient spell list.
---
I like this idea. I'll pass it to the other mods. Thank you.
---
Not quite. In fact, people of the underrepresented faction has felt it and transferred out of the realm to the safe havens when given the opportunity, leaving those who stayed to play in misery since the faction imbalance became truly huge for stayers.
---
&gt;How could a normal player who didn't do private servers have expected this outcome?
---
There were tons of warnings about it (not even related to population, just to current community mentality) and people have taken a hint. 
---
Check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/
---
Similar to what you have now?
---
&gt;Horde flair
---
I never professed that there isn't a gap in power levels.  I'm aware that R13/14 gear is ludicrously powerful, moreso the earlier you get it.  But all the gear in the world won't make up for poor play or shitty tactics.
---
I played vanilla heavily.  I never got past R7, if I recall correctly, but I never pushed hard to grind either.  And I knew I wasn't a match for certain players while I knew I could take others.  I didn't just walk away, I did what I could, where I could.  Gear is a constant difference that you have to learn to accept but not lean on it like a crutch.
---
People who hit 60 months ago are still farming for certain BiS pieces due to RNG.  Savage gladiator is a hard item to find.  Not to mention the grinds for rep and money.  Where are your righteous orbs coming from if no one runs Strat?  Or what about the dark runes for your healers?  Or the need for Large Brilliant Shards and Eternal essences?  Without 5 mans being regularly farmed for whatever reason, prices of everything would skyrocket.  Drop rates in dungeons are better than those outside for just about any common resource.  I get more runecloth in one dungeon run than during an equivalent farming session.
---
Poaching is constant but more due to needing players and less because of headhunting.  If your guild is blazing through content and hitting #1 to #5, you are flush with recruits and talents.  Trying to poach others isn't really a thing.  You won't try to get a new MT if your current one is geared to the teeth and more than satisfies the needs of the guild.
---
I'm not saying a guild needs two days for MC and BWL.  You can have a nice long raid session and clear both.  Or you can be nice to your raiders and not attempt a breakneck speed during the runs.  Speed clears are not typical and often require heavier consumable usage than a more casual run.
---
It's good to know that you need me while simultaneously hating that players with less time can be on equal footing skill wise or even better than you.  I'm glad to know that you are so petty to both demand I leave because I'm a scrub wasting space on your server and that I stay so you can have more of the minority faction to farm.  Keep screeching, so we know that we can safely ignore you.
---
Of course, I don’t mean to suggest this compares to retail class design. I’m just saying that there is at least *some* decision-making. When he streams, /u/norththemage does a good job of verbalizing these decisions.
---
Fantastic
---
This is fantastic! Got a great laugh out of it. Excellent animation too, well done! For the Horde!
---
Whats the plan then?
---
WHY ARE ALLY ALWAYS GANKING ME WHEN I'M JUST QUESTING
---
&gt;Yes let me waste 2 hours giving out water when I could be making gold or getting honor, makes sense. If you play a mage to 60 you would understand about 5 people per zone will ask your for water/food/portal. Food and Water usually takes 1-2min to make and replenish mana. That is 5-10 mins I could be playing...... I can make one silver in a second if I wanted too. I bet every level 60 mage at least wasted 2+ hours of game time making food/water for people.
---
Since very underpopulated servers exist already, it looks you are wrong.
---
Advantage of having lockpickers is outweighed by the large number of people in Org sometimes. 
---
Another advantage of TB, bankers are one click as opposed to two. I'll never understand why Horde bankers have a dialogue box you have to click through and TB/UC don't.
---
Not just rogues that do this.
---
The wasps aren’t elite. 
---
Quickly kill the one closest to the node, vanish in a safe spot to drop aggro. You will have a poison on you that will remove you from stealth, but as long as you vanish outside of their aggro range they will reset.
---
I was worried how i was going to avoid ganking myself after 30 on my priest alt, but thankfully Scarlet Monastery is in a horde controlled territory huzzah! Thought i would only have to do that the first time around due to overcrowded leveling zones. Shame i might miss out on some questing again especially now that i'm a priest instead of a warrior so i can actually quest much more easily solo this time. Though on the other hand i really just enjoy the group content and think i have a talent for healing as far as keeping the group topped off while maintaining my mana as best as i can with minimal downtime. Looking forward to seeing how challenging it really is.
---
Having fun doesn't mean your causal.
---
When you get ganked over and over in STV as a lvl 35 trying to turn in quests at Nesing when there's a squad of 60's camping it day and night?
---
Right, I'm totally the loser lol.
---
I'm alch but maybe could buy mats. The finished goods are $$ on my server.
---
It's the casual olympics.  It's a contest to see who can out-casual the others!
---
Might be more beneficial to comment on an existing   post instead of making a new one.
---
Bro I killed a mage in 2 seconds without any consumables
---
Our leadership doens't see any reason to start a 2nd raid group, we'd rather refine 1 group to the point of absolute success than have to manage multiple raid groups.
---
Whats the point in having more than 1 raid group? Is the guild benefiting more? IMO The only reason you are making multiple raid groups is if you're running DKP and want to sap as much gold from player donos as you can, there is no real reason that I can see to have a 2nd or 3rd group when the likelihood of them leaving is very large.
---
To all the Alliance STvietnam vets commenting below:
---
LAY IT ON ME BITCHES. I will continue to play pvp servers because fuck you, I will continue to gank your lowbie guildies and shitty druid alts, and the only thing you can do to stop me is to fly your little level 60 gnome ass over to stv to try and find me. All ill know is that ur a shit tier pvper and I swear that I hope to get matched against u in bgs. Also guess what, I have more than one acc too, and ill just play that until you get bored and leave, then ill hop back on the twink and do it all over. Camp me all you want, its a short walk from gy to nessing BITCH.
---
These posts are exactly why they DO go there.
---
Imagine complaint about people complaining. Oh wait, you don't have to imagine.
---
Is there a way of finding out how much penetrable resistance that raid mobs/bosses have? Don Rodrigo's band is going to be available soon, and I know spell pen is the best pve stat when it's needed ... but I'm not finding any resource/data to know when it's needed.
---
theres thousands of people to play with. you just havent met them yet
---
I 100% got this on my first kill on my priest. Got it in like 5 minutes on my hunter. Super bad RNG for you?
---
It’s not.
---
Welcome to forums for literally any remotely popular game, OP.
---
Happy customers aren't going to come to the forums to proclaim how happy they are. Unhappy customers are almost always going to come to the forums to proclaim how unhappy they are.
---
(waits to see how many parts this can survive until Blizzard kills it with Copyright infringement: because you're also asking for money too.)
---
I know! I did all the work for you guys :)
---
If I’d had been you, I might’ve just continued to play dumb. Maybe even just actually go afk. Tanks not gonna wait forever.
---
I don't care what happened the day. That's not now. There's literally no reward for griefing at graveyard in 1.12 AV and if you are actually pvping properly you won't be on the losing side. And again, you can just take the deserter and queue up in 15 mins. THERE ARE BATTLE GROUPS. YOU WONT GET THE SAME GAME.
---
Don't bag tier 2/3 gear in favor of statless resit greens or blues from mara, basically.
---
And why is that?
---
WSG if you're stomping pugs
---
Typical pally haha. Hard to find one of you without 3 other butt buddies riding your ass.
---
 No, it’s not like a recipe. It’s more of a BoP consumable, so that you’re the only one who can use it.
---
Oh yeah I think you’re right. It’s with Zul’Garub?
---
I didn't tell them there just like I'm not telling you now, so that means it's a lie? Ok then good logic. People in the warlock discord are aware of it by the way. It's been around since classic, people just arent farming it now because twitch, youtube, and reddit told them to do other farms.
---
 It's really funny that you are so adamant this isn't true, when I do it everyday. Very satisfying. Me and my buds are having a laugh.
---
I havent done LBRS.  I need to check that out.
---
I've been alternating the following, I normally just do about 30 minutes of each because its soul killing to do more and have been averaging 8-15g  a run.
---
BRD - pickpocket to plugger - steady but super boring, nowhere near as high GPH as people state
---
BRD - pickpocket to Relic coffer - same as above, ROI on AH'ed relic keys is minimal but noticeable
---
SM - seems profitable but my bags fill up so fast I'm making trips to Brill between each wing
---
EPL - my secret leather farming spot.  Rugged plus greys that sell plus the occassional RNG drop (I got an epic). I've yet to see another player here, even during prime time so I'm not saying where.
---
Tyrs - Pickpocket and farming the solitary ones. Lower GPH but chance of a bigger score. Random drops are poor though, Ive yet to get anything decent.  Generally safe on a PVP server, especially if you tuck yourself away in a building, but that takes more skill managing packs/pats.
---
Noxious Glade - more PVP action here but relatively manageable. Sometimes you will be in competition with bots.  Low GPH but you are multi tasking rep.
---
I don’t play on a PvP server this time around because I learned my lesson 15 years ago :)
---
As a fury warrior who tanks occassionally, this is why we have two sets of gear. Also we don't tank primarily in berserker stance. Bloodthirst, revenge, sunder make up most of our ST threat and most of these end up being cast in defense while DW or sword n board depending on the needed damage mitigation.
---
I played "hardcore" on multiple PvP servers from 2005 to 2010. It was never like this in Vanilla. Not even close. Don't act like it was.
---
Having alliance FPs, ships, and Blackrock mountain camped by horde DID happen from time-to-time and it was a big deal and it was exciting. But never like this....24/7.... everyday...
---
Woah a 39 twink ganking same levels doesnt mean honor targets, almost means same thing as a lvl 60 ganking a lower level, and a geared twink ganking same levels. A geared Twink can take on anyone up to like 10 levels over him so it isnt fair for you to pvp there either.
---
Nice blog
---
... WoW has changed lol
---
Pretty sure that only applies to single layer servers.
---
Nothing I wrote has anything to do with "keep em coming". Nothing came to begin with, and I have no idea what "em" refers to.
---
I don't do wPVP, don't have a level 60 character, and don't gank anyone in STV or anywhere else.
---
My post was about how your rant will have the opposite effect of what you hoped it would have, not that I engage in the behavior that you were whining about.
---
You can find rp things on rp realms. Come to ZT alli for some furry actions ;)
---
I completely agree, my friends left me behind the week I worked and I stopped playing at 40 as a warrior. Couldn’t handle the grind
---
I’ve noticed a lot of wow heads are just cancer.
---
Even my irl friend got me to play and started being a min max sweaty and just refused to help. 
---
I actually hit 60 and beat raids before him too hahaha fuck his try hard ass
---
I gank everyone, even red levels if that makes you feel any better. I just like pvping and practicing pvp. Where else am I gonna practice on a 39 twink? Stfu and get hemo’d
---
Complains about complaint posts. Nice.
---
Imagine not having the attention span do handle a 2:30 video, where the action is practically every 20 seconds
---
Nope. Given how brokenly op fear is... 3 lvls means shit
---
He's a resto druid, you can probably complete a quest or two by the time he's done killing you.
---
I run up to horde and have a few macros which describes my tiny weiner to them and gotten some 'kek' responses so I think they're getting the message.
---
Awesome :)
---
the one from booty bay where you have to pick up tiny, invisible bottles in the hinterlands is way worse
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=580/whiskey-slims-lost-grog
---
&gt; This isn't PvP.
---
This isn't Fortnite.
---
Bro they make addons that literally you just follow and arrow and step by step who to talk to and what quests to do.
---
If you have enchanting, soloing RFD/Uldaman for small/large radiant shards will typically be around 40-50gph (also make sure to pick up chests and such while stealthing around).
---
I don't see how so many people didn't see this coming. The last time i even looked at wow was in 2011 for about 2 months on a private server so i have very experience with mmo games in general. I this coming within moments of seeing the planned phase system, even before classic launched, and I'm an idiot. Are the rose colored glasses so bad no one can apply even a little thinking skills, or is everyone just that stupid?
---
Need roll all boe epics.
---
You should tell that to your friends...
---
The coefficient for DOTs is not worse due to most being instant casts, the cast-time only affects spell power coefficients for direct damage spells. The coefficient is based on the length of the DOT, with DOTs lasting 15 seconds or longer receiving full benefits from spell power. So Corruption and CoA both have a 100% coefficient, whereas shadowbolt is around 85%.
---
The basis is that it did happen and will happen again. Even when people knew their honor diminished. 5 kills per person is a lot AND people quit and new ones come in, giving you fresh honor kills.
---
You really have no idea what you're talking about and should stop pretending like you do. I'm speaking from actual experience having played in Vanilla.
---
Maybe, most chests are guarded by 2-4 mobs.  GY can be farmed at 40.
---
Nazgul currently has more wins than Snutz and is actually undefeated.
---
You dont wpvp so why does your little ‘diagnosis’ of the situation matter? fuck off mate and go run instance.
---
I haven't played this quest (I'm mostly on Horde side), so someone needs to explain what's in this stew -- I see a murloc eyeball? And why are her eyes blood red?
---
No one cares how many buttons you press if you do no damage.
---
Practising by giving yourself every advantage possible? Sounds like the Asmongold school of practise.
---
Try pvp with a normal char. The  maybe you can evolve into killing red levels with grey daggers and naked
---
How do you employ thousands of people with these social skills?
---
I play a shadowpriest, healed DM:N and E farms just yesterday, with a Shaman tank. It's definitely doable. Healing power matters significantly less than int/regen/ranking.
---
Luckily, its too late for that now. Server pops will remain, and hopefully Blizzard eventually increase concurretn cap.
---
and also, \#nochanges was never a thing.
---
"hunters"
---
I like the hammer. Never know when you'll need to craft more grenades out in the field.
---
Til that app stops at 40 like mine did  in blasted lands. It’s a long boring grind as a warrior and playing with your friends helps pass the time. Spamming for dungeons gets old when you thought it was going to be social
---
:)
---
And die of starvation, no thx.
---
I've been level 60 for weeks and have not had a single 1v1 pvp encounter, in fact the best I've had is a 3v1. So no, there is no honourable pvp happening.
---
This isn’t the meta, and I’m aware of what the meta is. Personally I enjoy duel wielding, the dmg output isn’t that much lower, and it feels as though you are always doing something instead of waiting for 3 sec to swing.
---
I don't like ganking lowbies or being ganked but you've got to realize (If you played before Cata you should know this) lots of people do.  It's human nature to play THIS video game that way, always has been and as long as there's a reason to go out into the world it always will be.
---
I rerolled on Old Blanchy (US West) last week and haven't had trouble with rfc or wc so far. Barrens seems pretty lively.
---
He's actually whining that he can't gank other players because he gets ganked.  Unironically.
---
Takes all kinds I guess...
---
No we should totally do loot council for the bags. I can make a way better argument on why my druid tank needs more bag slots then a warlock who can get larger shard specific bags if needed :)
---
You wouldn't say that shit to me in Gurbashi Arena.
---
Some EU countries have unemployment benefits. There are entire guilds of people who live like that. And it's not a WoW only thing.
---
This is when you replace the ww axe, have someone run you Mara and get the quest reward thrash blade and any offhand and try dw, i loved 2h grind back in the day but dw is so nice for the rage.
---
Then people will complain about servers being dead or unbalanced because alliance have been pvp farmed for the past week or so. "Why is my server deaf where have all the other players gone" 
---
You made a large majority quit due to your relentless camping is what has happened.... loads of players are already moving to horde due to alliance being unplayable and the rest who dont have the time to do this have just quit. Until horde is the more played faction (even more than usual) on almost all servers.
---
&gt; bgs were supposed to go live with bwl
---
They weren't "supposed" to do anything. They were just listed in the same phase as BWL. Same with diremaul/honor.
---
&gt;Bwl will likely be feb/march
---
0 chance
---
As a druid.... HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH SPACE IN YOUR BAGS!?
---
I think I have..... 4-6 spaces free in my bags typically.
---
I mean an enhance shaman with hand of rag will absolutely smack clothes.
---
I was thinking about something like this the other day...whats to stop two groups frm just agreeing over discord or something to take turns aoe'ing each other to death?  Two 40 man raids could meet up somewhere that their graveyards are relatively close together and give everybody involved 200 kills in 30 minutes.
---
Can I have your karma?
---
Sure let me pvp naked from now on and also with grey daggers just to prove a point. Only red levels u can kill with grey daggers are the ones afking on the shitter.
---
I'm not really sure what you're trying to prove here, but sure. Dedicating 42 hours a week grinding the same video game and doing the same thing in the video game is a huge commitment.
---
Again I don't have an issue with how it works.
---
The problem with this flair is that it filters everything, not just the wpvp posts. Well, I suppose it'll do for now.
---
I mean I can see your arguement and I know why people feel compelled to look at enemy players as bags of "honor". But is that bag of honor worth griefing for? If done in excessive amounts like we've seen on some servers people are just going to quit. And that's not benefitting you in any way. If anything Blizzard will support Classic even less than they already do if players start quiting and not providing the monthy paycheck for them.
---
True, he is tagged as an alliance warrior though. I made an assumption.
---
Real talk.  If you can only fill your soul bag with soul shards....why not keep it mostly if not completely full?
---
Idk I'm using one called Zygor something and it literally tell you where to go from 1-60. But as a warrior it should be easy for u to find dungeon groups anyway. Get back on the horse dude
---
well all things considered, if you read kant properly, you have to realize that his object of respect is reason, as in our capacity for reason.
---
Considering this is the internet, and especially WoW classic, which is notorious for forcing UNreasonable systems on us, I believe people's capacity for reason is much, much lower.
---
What I see here is more in line with a power structure, which can and should be broken, otherwise it will destroy itself. This is rather hegelian in nature.
---
Both parties see each other, they realize that in order to gain their honor, they must destroy the other, one knows that the other must destroy him as well, this brings about a fight for life and death.
---
This would be fine, only because we're in a min-max era of video games, this is taken to the max, bringing the entire server with both its factions to a life or death situation.
---
Because the conception is that horde are better in pvp, more people go horde, the more people that go horde but retain this concept of life or death, the more they wish to maximize their gain and reduce the chance of losing.
---
We have entered a master and slave dialectic, the horde are the masters, and they keep pushing the ally as slaves, the allies know how to pvp, in fact, they're probably even better at it, since they have to deal with much worse situations and they sometimes come out on top, and I believe we'll see it even more as BGs release.
---
But the masters will continue to try and destroy any form of resistance, and a lot of ally will stop trying to get on top of the dialectic, and will simply quit.
---
We'll see a destruction of servers by this dialectic, simply because people do not understand the implications of being masters for too long.
---
I AM UNTETHERED AND MY RAGE KNOWS NO BOUNDS
---
They added the flair so you don't have to see it if you don't want to.
---
Type -Flair:Vent/Gripe in your search bar. Boom, no more complaining.
---
This is simply not true, lotus spawns have always been an hour please stop saying this lmao.
---
More aggressively give bans to people who are toxic or just here to stir up shit
---
So there would be no posts lol
---
If Classic was truly no changes this wouldn’t be so bad. That doesn’t make the stance idiotic, but rather how Blizzard handled the game.
---
Strange.   You've got my subscription anyway! :D
---
Elemental Fires are also money. Like 5g+ on my server. Our guild raid asks everyone to bring 2 gfp's as the only consumable, but honestly I'd rather take a 15 minute detour to split the raid for the FR buff which will net resist well more than the ~2k hp average absorbed from a gfp than drop 10g on potions (and make the tanks/melee a lot less likely to die, potentially avoiding a wipe). I'm a holy priest, 10g saved in 15 min is as good a return on any solo gold farming I've managed to find.
---
I do this with VC in that same spot. It consists of killing each other then stopping for a while with emotes, after DR wears off we go at it again.
---
However, I do know some members of DOGZ and VC are chatting outside of game because one of the DOGZ rogues there was telling some of us what VC was saying to them (DOGZ). While I'm not certain if all of DOGZ and VC are colluding, some of most definitely are.
---
It never has and layering is gone anyways.
---
link your parses kid.
---
Big talk from a noop kid who thinks daggers are for warriors.
---
No, for two reasons. The first is that the imbalance that caused entire zones to be horde camping alliance 24/7 will still exist, which will lead to very long queue times for horde to get into BGs, which means while they're waiting, they'll be camping zones still.
---
The second reason is for the majority of people camping flight paths, camping the path from thorium point to brd, roaming around in 40 man raid groups to 40v1 people etc, they are not doing this for honour. They are doing it strictly for the purpose of griefing people. The personality disorders these people have will exist after BGs come out, and BGs do not really allow this kind of griefing, so they will continue doing it.
---
Does your server not try to bracket stack? Unless there's some chinese guild forcing everyone to play 24/7, people try to limit themselves.
---
Yeah, having the flare gun bug out would be a problem, but the swim is only 20 seconds, and it takes you through a very cool zone that you would otherwise skip over.
---
Disagree. We don’t need 50 posts a day at 0 upvotes asking “should I play a warlock?” “People who are lvl 60 with full T1, do you like your class?”
---
Thanks buddy! :) Always appreciated!
---
&gt;It seems like a half thought out idea at best.
---
It's been extensively thought out. But people don't like math, and prefer short posts (preferably images).
---
&gt;I'm just not in favor of creating systems that don't really provide any added benefit beyond satisfying complaints.
---
Complaints cause people to [quit playing](/r/classicwow/comments/e40px0/alliance_are_quitting_at_least_temporarily/), and lead to faction imbalance. Unless you like a one-faction game, you should care about the complaints that other players have.
---
&gt;If someone is ganking you, add them to your KoS list and get them whenever you see them, you don't need a debuff/honor to do that.
---
You haven't heard about how Phase 2 has made it difficult or impossible for some people to level? Anywhere they go they get killed, even when they try to quest underwater? https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4sfsz/honorless_corpse_camping/
---
You can't get revenge on someone by killing them back if you're still lvl 30.
---
Are Dark/ Demonic Runes useful for us locks with Lifetap? It also shares a cool down with our healthstone so I'm curious to hear from people that use them and why.
---
Definitely had our shadow priest argue they should be able to roll on Tier 1. I said, "You 100% can....once every holy priest has the piece you want."
---
Not true, I used to hump dead alliance all the time in ghost wolf / travel form on my shaman/druid
---
&gt; You dont wpvp so why does your little ‘diagnosis’ of the situation matter?
---
Because you failed to understand the implications of your whiny rant. I pointed that out, nothing more.  Thought it might help you see fit to delete it or prevent you from wasting your time with similar rants in the future. You're actively encouraging them with posts like this. You didn't seem to understand this.
---
I'm sorry that offended you so badly, but when you post things on a discussion board you should expect replies.
---
He was citing the top comment as support for the idea that there are no more than 4k concurrent players. The top comment was implying the literal opposite of that idea, and that although the layers were removed the players are still there.
---
This would be perfect for me. Maybe have another server type so people who do like what's happening now can have somewhere to play as well.
---
creativity of horny people never ceases to disappoint me \*unzips\*
---
nope all mine :P
---
Lol, I was 2.2k in wrath and cata, but due to irl conflicts had to stop playing for a while and now I play fairly casual.
---
But tbh, I really don’t care what some rando on reddit believes.
---
I flared it meta
---
This might be a dumb question but how bad do you think the premades are going to be? Should I just give up any hope of fair matches queuing solo? Based on what I am hearing lately it sounds like premades might be a much worse problem than I originally thought :(
---
Yes, exactly.  
---
For me anyway, it's not necessarily about not having the aggro, it's about feeling helpless to do anything.  Without rage, we just sit and auto attack and taunt every ten seconds.  
---
I saw a really good comment on here a few weeks ago from another tank who said that he wished that DPS would understand that there's basically three seconds separating having fun and not having fun for most tanks.  If the DPS holds off for about 3 seconds, that's enough time for the tank to get enough rage to do _something_ with the pull.  If they don't, it just becomes a nightmare where you can't control anything.  
---
My message to OP is: accept that DPS aren't going to wait.  You can try to inform them, but in general I find it fruitless.  Better to accept their behavior and adapt.  Letting skull go accomplishes this for DPS warriors.  If they don't attack skull first, I will say something.
---
It’s a classic example of the prisoner’s dilemma. The incentive to cheat is too high, and people cannot agree on who goes first.
---
Things like this sound great but in reality it'll end up being a lot of posts asking small questions with 20 people telling them to search for it. 
---
I think it'd be a great way to do it, even if every posts isn't some deep question or it's a repeat. I think a lot of people would get annoyed though. Just imagine if every post in the daily question thread was it's own post. Is that what you want?
---
The fact that layering is gone doesn't change what happened in the past. For a period of time where some servers had 2 layers and other servers had 1 layer, lotus respawns were 2 hours on the 2 layer servers and 1 hour on the 1 layer servers I'm pretty sure. Then when the patch that increased devilsaur respawns hit the lotus respawns were increased as well.
---
This is the best advice here, only doing quests on mobs below your level is the single biggest thing you can do to improve your leveling experience as a warrior
---
&gt; The population size has nothing to do with layering
---
I am not really gonna argue with you, because I think ultimately we agree. But I would like you to explain to me why you think layering has nothing to do with population size.
---
Why?
---
Fun fact you can portal your own alts.. just get someone else to join the group and invite your alt/main, then bring your mage to the alt/main, cast portal, log out, log back in.. portal remains for 60 seconds upon being cast so you can hop on in and teleport yourself
---
Ban all dad gamer crybabies and all crossposts from /r/wow
---
I hate to be *that guy* but with this amount of players, layering would probably fix a lot of the griefing. There are too many players in one place.
---
And the /r/2007scape cycle begins. Excited for new thing, lets talk about new thing, memes about new thing, complaints about thing, complaints about complaints about thing. 
---
Then wait for the meme complaint about the complaint of the complaints!
---
Not saying you're wrong. This is just the exact same thing that happened over on the other osrs sub haha.
---
please suggest a good addon then?
---
I don't really have a definition, nor do I believe there is a line in sand that determines it.
---
But I think the term casual in WoW has become a buzz word.
---
&gt;They will be camping flightpaths, instance entrances, zone entrances and really any other high traffic area in level 50+ zones - don't forget anyone level 48+ gives a level 60 honor, so this will include zones like Searing Gorge etc.
---
Sounds like what you said though, right? 50+ zones?
---
I still don't see how this is an enjoyable field to play in. I always wanted to like pvp servers but you're literally catering to asshole show wanna gank. Some ppl don't care about honor. They will ga k loves all day. Undergrad players and all. 
---
Why play a game as good as this one only to burn hours and hours of ur playtime corpse walking ? 
---
I'm not using that "roll on a pve realm" bullshit line... but I have played pve for a long time now and I jist can't see what's so good about pvp realms. Even on pve servers there are enormous, constant wars, many places too. Guilds form pvp events and groups and such too. 
---
BGS are more my thing tbh and that probably explains a lot. But when u wanna farm and quest, i don't see pvp realms being very optimal.
---
Try dual wielding, I felt the same way as you and switched to dual wielding and found the weapon swings much more engaging.
---
When you need 10 people to cheat at the same time, it's a lot more controllable.
---
It's a huge help versus mages the damage on eviserate is not that needed really.
---
Gatorbite has 5% more crit than either of the two maces. Hell if you're not speccing into Sword or Axe talent in arms then you're better off just getting Resurgence Rod from the Mara quest and using that until BRD/Strat/LBRS/whatever pre-raid 2H you get.
---
There would have to be sufficient monetary incentive, which there is not.
---
i will most likely be showing them this eventually...(wishfully thinking they see it)
---
Mining in winter spring
---
I usually go from Redridge. Sometimes I'm lucky and a raid or gank squad will be waiting to go so I use those guys as temporary cover... until they outpace me out their mounts.
---
You have no fucking clue lmao
---
Back in the day I swam from Booty Bay all the way to that zone because I was a level 30 idiot.
---
fear ward is super helpful, and paladins are super good, thats true.
---
the entire experience from 1-60 is easier/more convenient/safer for horde. at end game raiding, many things are great for pve. Wotfk, berserking, blood fury, are all nuts.
---
I carry one soul bag full, with the felcloth soul bag that's 24 shards which is usually more than enough.
---
This guy is a fkn knob if he thinks duels are the catch all for being good in classic. I'm pretty sure Tmugsy would dump his true strike wearing ass.
---
Yes and 1/40 of enhancement shamans will ever get one. All of the enhancement shamans I've played with think they are that 1/40 and they do as much dps as a hunter without arrows. The point is that enhancement shamans are there to enhance the group, not to be the penultimate dps spec of classic.
---
1 more thing
---
I just think it’s funny how EVERYBODY shits on people who complain about wPvP and EVERYBODY shits on people who are tired of seeing the posts about it. The internet is a weird place lol, nobody’s ever happy
---
sadly, it's not.
---
I use one called Zygor guides. If u go to their website you have to pay for it but my friend send me a link to download it for free. DM me your discord ID and I'll send it to you
---
Hell yeah man Myzreal over here
---
Everything seemed fine until the 1k bonus. MC is a cake walk, and I wouldn't be there if I had literally know chance at gear from the easy ass content. It's not like those Raid 1 members are actually carrying your group.
---
Friends wanna play on a PvP server.
---
I completely missed the quartermaster at bulwark :D lhc is a warzone (horde can stand a chance but it's constant war so going to the vendor is not really an option) but bulwark is fine as long as no one is doing the barov quest
---
You have a bad experience with 1 guy it seems most people forget the 9 other good ones.
---
Skeram Alliance has at least 3 guilds that I'm aware of running two raid groups. My guild is even considering starting a third raid group soon now that most people are dinging 60 on their alts.
---
Absolutely not here's a video for you that you will most likely also not understand
---
https://youtu.be/MShv_74FNWU
---
I'm not talking about for PvE necessarily, PvP aswell.  All of the epic sets are AQ level items for PvP.  As far as PvE goes, many of the epic items are BiS until AQ, where they are pretty much equivalent to AQ items.  See r13 warr shoulders, r12 warr pants, rogue hat and pants? I believe, etc.
---
As far as mage PvE goes, the blue set shoulders and boots are actually your PvE BiS through all of AQ, and only get replaced in Naxx by gluth shoulders and then t2.5/3 boots depending on if you need the hit.

---
I've had to face this when hitting the aggro cap, when I did more damage than the tanks could keep up with. If you're not in a shitty guild, *no one cares.* It's not a race, it's about killing the boss. If it dies without issues, pushing the last bit of damage by chugging tons of consumables does not matter.
---
I've also started holding back intentionally on Ony, because even with 20 people you tend to way outperform the benchmarks you're intended to hit and it makes things way easier for everyone if you're low on the threat table.
---
Yeah people take this shit way too seriously, ty
---
I don't think it's only about wPVP. 
---
You will have complaints about BGs queues, premades, paladins, AV design and dead servers very soon.
---
Transfer before you get locked into your server. We toughed it out on Herod and now the whole guild raid logs.
---
Yep that's where I get them and I usually only use like 2-3 per MC.
---
You seem pretty out of touch. There are at least 3 guilds on Mankrik horde side that have 2 raid teams, mine included, and Mankrik is casual as fuck. My guild runs between 25 and 35 characters in each raid, some are alts, some are trials, and the core is our main raiders. It was a little risky at first, but once you get it established it's not much different than having one raid for a guild, except you get double the chances at good loot.
---
it's the bds set, so bds shoulders, boots, and legs.
---
Huge warning: apparently Eye of Killrog summoned by the item from strat UD counts as a civilian, once more people discover this it could cause a lot of griefing, especially if it works in BGs.
---
Well it's not that I want to be good, it's just that being on a PvP server during phase 2 means that I'm constantly forced into pvp while doing my quests.  I almost always lose all ganks even when it's just 1 person so I was hoping for something that could help me defend myself against each class.
---
I can see what you mean by that. I’ve only tanked dungeons and there I never have rage enough to use HS. Can see it’s uses in raids thou.
---
I'm playing classic for the first time ever. I was killed like 3-4 times yesterday while questing, so I just threw into the chat that there was some alliance players killing horde in Stonetalon Mountains and some higher level horde players started looking for them -shrug- that's one way of dealing with it
---
Another time I got ganked outside of Orgrimmar and did the same thing, and was promptly told to go fuck myself. So, it's hit or miss. I have no clue what I'm doing given I'm experiencing this all for the first time, I stand no chance against some random alliance player who appear out of nowhere with blood in their eyes. I'm sure I'll get there at some point.
---
The community has changed indeed but that's the community fault of choosing the minmaxing tryhard way.
---
Yeah, fuck making more new friends!
---
There is a little part of me that kind of likes that aspect. Like, it's inevitable that extra mobs are going to be pulled, let's see if I'm good enough to juggle the threat of all of these mobs and protect my healer.
---
I've had a pet bear that I tamed in Dun Morough. I'm a level 53 hunter and just noticed that my pet bear only has rank 4 and 2 for claw and bite. How should I rank up claw and bite to the max level while keeping my original pet?
---
Also, always curious about other pet suggestions that would be good for PVP and late game PVE. Thanks!
---
Yeah but ignoring a correlation is silly. You say it’s probably due to overpopulation, but servers were over populated before the honor system rolled out and the chat issues only started afterwards. Coincidentally, a huge number of people downloaded and are using an honor addon that utilizes the chat servers to process information. 
---
This isn’t rocket science, people. Not sure why some are defending it for no reason. We can’t confirm that it is or isn’t the cause, but to dismiss it altogether is just silly.
---
pretty sure its full t1
---
1. Don't stand in fire
---
2. Don't go overboard with dps in phase 1
---
3. Go overboard with dps in phase 2 (when she's in the air)
---
4. Avoid Deep Breath
---
5. In phase 3 (when she lands) let tank pick up aggro - depending on tank, wait 5 - 10 seconds
---
6. Get your pet to kill whelps
---
7. Don't die
---
Dude youre such a loser lmao , imagine not being level 60 and not spending 12+ hours a day camping lowet levels, pathetic
---
Or mage with the frost bolt spam.

Unless you peasant caller strat you will literally get melted with 0 NR.  FR may have been a 2005 meme but NR and FrR are not

People seem to think it will get better when battlegrounds drop.. I dunno
---
The six spots getting searched by 500 players?
---
&gt;except everywhere in the comments of every post lol
---
Imagine people randomly comment venting in popular threads just because they know no one will see their complaints in a separate post lol
---
I'd quit the game if they re-introduced layering.
---
It already cause immense damage, and we finally got rid off it.
---
Is there a source for that vanish hotfix? I felt like vanish was working a little better but then my vanished failed twice recently on the same mob and shattered my dreams. No I was not dot’d and the mob was not even mid swing. They just keep running after you for a split second AFTER you vanish. It’s broken I think.
---
there is a way to do this, but it's a bit of a hassle:
---
- Get someone to invite you to a party
---
- log out, and log back in on an alt
---
- get that person to invite your alt to the party
---
at this point you can remove the other person and you'll be in a party with yourself.  The first time you do this, you can have the other person pass the lead to your alt, and you can reset your own instance while your main is still inside it (but logged out).
---
You can run the instance again on your main, then when you want to reset you log off and log back in to your alt.  The lead will automatically get passed the alt after 90 seconds - at which point you can reset yourself again.
---
I find it's best to do this with my bank alt, as I can use those 90 seconds to list auctions.
---
If someone used a sapper to 1v1 me I laugh and I win because they wasted gold.
---
You forget about Fury warriors being able to 1 shot you, and Blood DKs being immortal in Cata. I still think that 3.3.5a was the best patch for pvp.
---
The reason it is so bad right now is the delayed releases of BGs. The honor system is in play which makes every min max nerd want to complete.... once BGs (dec 10) are released we will hopefully see a decrease of ganking in wPvp.
---
That’s got a low drop chance.  People have run ZF more than 30 times without seeing it drop.  If you have the SoJ in your hand -and you’re a mage - you use it.
---
I'm a soon-to-be 60 undead warlock and am heavily considering cutting my losses on investing in leveling enchanting to 235ish and take up engineering instead. My other profession is 300 tailoring; I intend to grind demonic runes when I hit 60 and craft robe of the void.
---
I've been mildly considering it for a while, but an experience I had at level 54 has made me strongly reconsider. I had been carrying the three stun grenades you get from the goblin quest in Azshara. One time when I was in Felwood and had finished a grind, on partial health and mana, a 52 warrior and 54 paladin tried to gank me. Using one of the bombs completely changed the fight and I ended up killing them both with the help of a soul stone resurrection (not claiming they were high skill - the paladin panicked a bit when I fought back resolutely). I stayed by to test myself again and see if I was just lucky; they both opened for the second time and attacked me - I finished them off again (with no soul stone this time). Then shortly after, they got a level 60 to come help them - I used the last bomb; yes I got killed but with use of the bomb I managed to still kill the warrior. They then proceeded to corpse camp me but that's a different story!
---
The point is, the stun grenades were a game changer in a fight that should have been heavily unfavourable for me and ended up giving me a great experience. Do you think it's worth me scrapping enchanting and learn engineering (which I imagine will be additionally costly without mining)? Or perhaps after crafting robe of the void, should I scrap tailoring, or will it be important when ZG is released?
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
You can restore deleted/sold items through the battle net support website. 
---
Dont even need to ask a GM.
---
Lol u can make alts together on a pve realm maybe ? And u and ur friends are all dying consistently so again, burning hours and hours of time spent dead. 
---
Everyone is saying their friends went pvp so they did too... but surely the friends are suffering also. 
---
I get the idea, everyone likes a different game. Most enjoy the thrill of wat ch ing ur back (pointless as it may be)
---
But it's like playing call of duty and just losing for 20 matches straight, no kills at all, spawn killed every rebirth. Whats the point ? U literally lose that time even more than by being on a game in the first place. Might as well pve it up. Jist saying. From over a dozen ppl talking to me in detail about how they feel epicly stupid for being pvp for years. They went pve and severely prefer it.
---
Awesome, still no opinion huh?
---
Hello all! What's the ideal level range to do quests and grind in STV? Playing as a hunter (level 30) on PVE realm. Thanks! :O)
---
pvpers are dicks.
---
I'm pretty sure you don't have to use any fire resistance gear. I off tank rag, and that's the only fight I use my fire resist set. Fairly certain that fire resist gear isn't worth it anywhere else, and not worth it for anyone but tanks on ragnaros
---
Na I like WW for killing things one at a time. The key to warrior leveling was only fighting things lower level than you. Fighting green mobs makes taking two on at once doable.
---
I've heard them used to help make our casting more efficient in raids, saving you from triggering the GCD with Lifetap
---
I feel like it should be an agreed upon thing that everybody just needs the valuable boes instead of agreeing to all greed.
---
You can't even talk to your friends about this? That's pretty lame. Not as lame as your stated intentions of this post.  
---
Maybe that's why they left you behind.
---
Absolutely dreading the AV posts. Surprised we don’t have as many “reserved runs are dumb” posts as I expected.

The basis of the game is wrong if the caps are not in place.

A few quick tips for any leveling warrior;
---
-Having a weapon that is solid for your level (blue, preferably higher ilvl than your level) has an insane affect on your combat ability. 
---
-Always fight mobs that are lower level (1-3 levels is best). This is because of how hit chance works. 
---
-Cooking (and Fishing ofc) + First aid saves you huge amounts of downtime. Even if it takes you a night or two of playtime to get it sorted, it’ll “pay” for itself in downtime reduction  before you hit 60. 
---
Warrior has a very bad reputation for their leveling experience, and while every class can benefit from gear and secondary profs, Warrior also scales better with gear and out-of-class tools. It just takes a bit of knowledge to get there. A bit of research on ClassicDB or Wowhead can payoff great.
---
You mean the vocal tiny minority?
---
It doesn't really matter if you stop at rank 14, 13, 12 or lower - if you're sitting in the bracket that caps you at that rank, you will be getting ~1k rank points per week in the end so a DHK is equally bad for everyone towards the end. Of course, those going for R14 lose more real time, but in terms of time required to reach your rank it's pretty much the same.
---
HOARD BAD ALLEY GOOD. GIVE GOLD PLS
---
My friends all called me a wuss for rolling on a PVE server. I have no server queues and I haven't been plagued with horde deathballs.
---
&gt;As a 60, I leave the greys alone.
---
weak
---
I'm on a PVE server and there is a battle happening most of the time at Tarren Mills between at least 20 players every day. You can jump in whenever you like and leave whenever. It's really fun.
---
First, no it doesn't. Second it makes no difference since vanilla was capped at that level classic should be too.
---
i do agree on warlock SR on twin emps.
---
and Fr on sapphiron.
---
but huhuran will melt before NR matters.
---
&gt; Sure let me pvp naked from now on and also with grey daggers just to prove a point
---
yeah, twinking is the same as a 60 coming to kill a 39. If you want to prove a point, be at a disadvantage
---
My friends got me to play for the first time, i was the first to 60 out of our group, with only 1 remaining friend still on who also hit 60.
---
&gt; It's been extensively thought out. But people don't like math, and prefer short posts (preferably images).
---
More like people don't like systems that can be easily exploited and add nothing to the game beyond targeting someone that has PvP'd a lot.
---
&gt;Complaints cause people to quit playing, and lead to faction imbalance. Unless you like a one-faction game, you should care about the complaints that other players have.
---
That's a player issue though, if the reason they're leaving servers is due to the PvP, they should not have been on PvP servers to begin with.
---
&gt;You haven't heard about how Phase 2 has made it difficult or impossible for some people to level? Anywhere they go they get killed, even when they try to quest underwater? https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4sfsz/honorless_corpse_camping/
---
I've leveled from 20-52 since the honor patch, it's everything I've wanted.
---
Leveling from 1-60 with layering and no honor never felt like a PvP server. 
---
&gt;You can't get revenge on someone by killing them back if you're still lvl 30.
---
I'll happily direct you to a video of a level 36 killing 60's.
---
That sounds excellent! 
---
Can I ask what RP realm you play on?
---
&gt;They should be out tanking their own groups, IMO.
---
Fully agree, I usually keep very up to date my gear (think getting WW weapon at Lv30) so at similar levels - another Warrior or Paladin tank will get blown out of the water if I'm DPSing.  Until I reach Lv50+ dungeons if I'm at an appropriate level for the dungeon I fully expected to 2H tank it
---
Be more active and enforce rules. The DKP meme thread should've been locked in 30m not 12hr.
---
The best strategy as Enhance is to try to maximize your crit percentage for Flurry uptime and throw an iron counterweight on the Nightfall for extra attack speed. 
---
With 33% crit chance, the shaman should have near 100% Flurry uptime and should be able to keep Nightfall up no problem.
---
Sounds like you're already there
---
Damn I'm not at my computer right now but I have full cleared ever level in peggle. You want to get the final talent that turns a blue peg into another green peg after you cup a ball (forgot the name). That will help you full clear the last few levels and beat the game.
---
dude my friends per hour sucks ive been trying zf spellcleaves but idk bro
---
Warlock hands down if it’s a serious bank alt. 
---
You’ll want to be level 35+ for max level crafting profs for the cool downs on things like cloth or transmutes. If you are going to level to 35, might as well make it 40 and get the free mount. 
---
On top of that Warlocks are dead simple to level because they are a pet class, and can have extra utility like being a summon bot if on an alt account, etc. 
---
Now, if your bank alt is literally just for storage space and proximity to the AH, then I guess it doesn’t matter at all... But even then, Warlock, because it leaves the door open for a level 40 crafting alt down the road.
---
Biggest factor is your playstyle.  Are you at the front lines fighting?  Are you sneaking around and capping towers?  Certain roles in AV reward more honor.  I do not recall if you get honor for a kill if you are dead.  In WPvP, you don't.  So if your class is cursed with high mortality, WSG may be better.  AV is better if you live longer and can see/assist on more kills.
---
&gt;but how should loot distribution work?
---
We roll for everything with common sense rules in place to ensure gear distribution.
---
It works pretty damn well and I've no complaints. At the end of the day, that's something each guild must figure out themselves.
---
I don't know how you expected anything different on a PvP server.
---
As a healer, I have NEVER done this nor do I know anyone who has.
---
It's already hard enough to pry a couple stacks of water out of a mage, much less the hundreds you'd need to actually make this an effective strategy.
---
&gt; It's way more useful on a pally/shaman than a warrior. 
---
It’s purely a status symbol. Whoever is going to farm the thousands of gold in mats should get it.
---
No you cannot, I tried that as soon as I hit revered. 
---
You CAN do that with Arcanums though, it can be a good way to make money if you're willing to do an Arcanum and then sell the completed enchant.
---
i’m chilling, you didn’t upset me. it’s weirdo’s like you who make claims and accusations like that on the internet I have a problem with. you didn’t have to say it, so why did you? you’ve offered nothing important to the discussion (specifically on my post about debuff priority) besides you shouting a generalized falsism on the internet because you don’t have to take any responsibility for it. 
---
the only nerve you hit is the same one all of you who act / respond like you, do; which is the general lack of responsibility or concise thought on the internet.

They put out a patch back in September that disables the mod that takes census' through /who.

Google also backs this up.
---
No one is denying the buff is useful.
---
The issue is the buff will take awhile to get.  How long does it take to move an entire raid into a saved ubrs instance?
---
No mount no care
---
&gt; And also not in the majority. It's a 1% club and statistically, even in a year, you are not likely to run into a full premade of R13/14 players.
---
then you have the R10s premade, not quite as a deadly but will also roll over the casual joe...
---
&gt;ou've made the assertion that people are done with their pre-BiS farm. And that is a blatant lie. People are working on their pre-BiS, even the ones clearing MC in 30 minutes. And the flood of new 60s need to gear up as well. Perhaps in 3 months, we will have a lack of players looking for dungeons but right now is a good time to be gearing up.

they are busy camping people in searing gorge at the moment.
---
&gt;How many blues drop in a raid? Not that many. And the trash purples don't make Brilliant Shards, they make Nexus.

Dark Runes sell. Mana pots sell. Runecloth sells. You are discounting everything and everyone who doesn't have the same exact playstyle and experience as you.
---
and you consider dark rune farming a good reason to keep 5 man relevant.

---
It's not that you haven't thought your idea through, and your idea is essentially how lower level zones work anyway, but if implemented how does your idea differ substantially then the current PvE servers? First off the majority of complaints on this subreddit are from people 48+ so that won't help them. Currently grey characters don't give honor so the only reason to kill them is in order to create nonconsensual pvp which is ENTIRELY THE POINT of the pvp servers rule set.  Remember, the pvp servers were created to appeal to people who played games like UO, MUDS or EQ pvp servers, they were not created for the general gaming audience. It's unfortunate that so many people were talked into picking the wrong server type but I don't think essentially removing PVP servers is the answer. I think blizzard should offer free transfers and then merge the remaining servers into the most equal things they can create but that ship might be too far sailed at this point.
---
Damn that’s 9g I just wasted!

Wow, not one, but two upvoted /u/superopioidcrisis_v2 comments. What a day.

You can do mara even as holy

I already said i didnt count PVE OR RP servers and i also only calculated American servers, because the ratio are not that bad on Europe and most of the complaints are from US servers.
---
But yea my math was right :)

if it's a 40 min queue, it seems quite certain that that would be a risk well worth taking in terms of honor per hour
---
Yeah I hear you, and I'm definitely not trying to say that mages have it bad. 
---
I personally carry a full spell damage set, a full AoE/farming set, and a full pvp set with extra trinkets (although there's a good amount of overlap). 
---
Between that, consumables, and miscellaneous stuff I probably still have 12-20 free spots on average. 
---
All of that changes on raid nights, where I have a minimum of 6 stacks of food, 15 stacks of water, and multiple mana gems.
---
It's not like these mobs have enrage timers, it saves us much more time to interrupt/hard CC a heal cast.  Especially in multi healer packs where I'm gated by my Pummel / Shield Bash
---
Will cross realm bgs be server type specific? Aka I play on a pve server, will I cross realm with other pve servers or all types?

Scrap enchanting, it's worthless for most people. Unless you're a guild enchanter and/or willing to drop hundreds of gold for enchanting recipes, I don't think you'll make much money from it at all.

Yep I'm alliance on Benediction, had to stop leveling my 59 rogue because all dungeon quests and solo were camped. I've unsubbed, and waiting to hear about transfers off that gank-farm fest shithole.
---
He's horde ccx so I assume BRM
---
I think PvP zones will be pretty dead as any Alliance (or Horde on Heartseeker) still even playing the game will just queue up from capital cities and spend all of their time there. As for those still leveling like myself, they’ve probably already quit the game or created an alt on a PVE server.
---
there’s been at least one on Kirtonos for a couple of months now
---
&gt; you've been killing trolls for a while for a quest in arathi, and someone from the other faction shows up to kill them as well. You're bored of the ease and simplicity of killing trolls, so you attack that person, if not to drive them away so you can continue farming then to break the monotony. And you win! But they come back, with a vengeance, and they kill you this time! This continues until eventually the other player, defeated, slumps off to do some other quest and come back to the trolls later.
---
This has been like 80% of my pvp experience on my server so far. With another 15% being organized raid v raid stuff, and then 5% ganks. I got really lucky picking the server I did.
---
Kind of an unknown because populations are much greater now than vanilla.  It should go down significantly and if people are waiting in ques that means they will be world PvPing in places closer to que locations.
---
Seriously people, stop crying for Daddy Blizzard to save you Everytime something happens that you don't like. You rolled on a pvp server, which means you acknowledge that you are going to be a part of pvp, often when you don't want to be.
---
I'm a tauren druid on skeram, and you know what? I got corspe camped by a pathetic alliance warrior and paladin Sunday while trying to fish in Feralas. Literally just trying to fish. So stop crying about faction imbalance. I can't go to LHC or DM without getting ganked by 15 alliance.

If you can't deal with it, and it's so terrible, reroll and learn from your mistakes.

You made precisely zero suggestions in your first post, though, so it's pretty rich to suggest you're making any kind of meaningful contribution to the discussion at hand. You merely attempted to shoot down the one suggestion that *was* made and then spent 2 paragraphs whining about the state of the sub.
---
You're a part of the very problem you profess to have.
---
Ooh me that kind of Orc!
---
The first expansion is going to cause people's heads to explode.  It really doesn't matter how populated a server is if every player piles into the same zone to level at the same time.  
---
Imagine starting out at level 1 in the same quest area as the other faction, all the way to level 60.
---
I transferred to a PvE server two days after TBC dropped, and it was the best quality of life decision I could have made.
---
Much like in real life, it's not the amount of labor that makes work valuable, it's the product. And an enhancement shaman adds nothing a restoration shaman can't bring to the raid. Improved WF/STR totems can be expressed in DPS and added to the enhancer's own output, the numbers don't add up to what a real damage dealer dishes out.
---
Of course, the current content is trivial and it's up to the RL to decide. But that decision is made to casually raid with friends - which is fine. It really is. But it doesn't answer the question on how to maximize a raid's performance.
---
Eh, just hold onto it, you'll replace your shoulders eventually and you can use it then. Not really a waste, as it's not like those enchants lose their value any time soon. It takes forever to get Exalted.
---
Go kill elites in Winterspring. Mine dropped off the first mob. Since we got lucky with that we farmed another one for our shadow priest, and it took like an hour and a half. We did that pre-p2 though, so who knows how bad it is now?

Her eyes are closed, those black lines are meant to be her eye lashes, it's pretty common in anime shows to show closed eyes like this. As for the stew it's made up of a bunch of different ingredients, iirc it's stuff from murlocs, coyotes, boars and buzzards.

Either drops or it doesnt. 50/50
---
Sadly 44 is the technical halfway point for leveling. Between /played or xp required, that is the average half way for most people
---
So many people hoarding Black Lotuses that the prices will drop rapidly. Not only is that a factor but the fact that people expecting prices to go up will make people more inclined to farm the shit themselves and make the flasks within their guild. Most guilds have their alchemist and herbs farmed. The best time would be to sell them now while people are still holding out for a increased price.
---
Nah you're gonna have to redo it. You've done it before though so it should only take a month or two this time around.

You ddidnt say you were referring to US servers, did i have to break this down for you?

Yes there is. PvP surrounding competition of small resources is usually fun and 1v1. I'm not talking Devilsaue, if you want to have fun 1v1s farm Sage in Winterspring or thorium veins. All of my favorite wpvp moments have been winning or losing a resource to someone.
---
Blizzard fucked up tremendously. They also gave the players the tools to fix it, but they didn't. Too many people unwilling to leave their favorite streamer's server. It's not fair and it's not good business, but it's on us to clean up their mess.

50% of the time, it drops every time.

I have one thing in ElvUI that I cant figure out how to change... When a party member starts losing health, their health bar in the party/raid frame fades from class color to red as they get lower. Is there a way to make it not do that?

Most of my attempts of discussions usually ends up dead or the other party not arguing for the sake of an opinion but more of not being proved wrong. I do think you're right with what is most common, but there are different "levels of hell" (swedish expression). My favorite Reddit is the PoE Reddit. Most times it's filled with outrageous items that some hardcore guy crafted, which is hard to have a discussion about, but there are lots of content being published at that Reddit like builds people come up with that brings fruit to lots of interesting ideas and discussions.
---
This used to happen back when the game was first released. I don't think they ever learned how to fix it.
---
Barman and Specter's are roughly equivalent and you might want both.  The bleed from Barman doesn't work on undead, and, of course, the AP is useless against anything but undead.
---
If you're already stacking +crit, the Heartseeker is good for both.  The strength bonus is almost totally negligible for rogue though.
---
He asked why? Like if I ask you why you like one car over a different car would you say "people like different things" or would you maybe try to quantify an actual response?

The few who told blizz and the communities (reddit/forums/etc) back then were bashed and downvoted into oblivion because the pserver players wanted the huge battles which were possible on pservers.
---
That's the only change that Blizz accepted probably because they got in touch with the guys behind Nostalrius and saw that it could work if they managed the initial burst of users (for which they implemented layering as a temporary solution).
---
If they stayed true to the original Vanilla configuration and kept te population cap at whatever the hell it was, we wouldn't be in this sad kind of state, but they had to appease the pserver crowds so there you have it.
---
If you go back to when Classic wasn't released yet and the discussion on how it should have worked and see the threads, you'll see thousands of comments saying "if they stay with the original pop cap the realms will be wastelands".
---
I bet it's the same one who bitched for layers and now for camping.

Amen!
---
People complain about these quests that send you across the world, but the reality is that they take up merely a few percent, if even just 1%, of the total quest mass. There's no need to do them in order to hit level 60, it's just that people can't stave off the sense of completionism.
---
I too think these wonky quests are part of the charm. I'm one of the crazies that love zones like Azshara... because it's remote and has weird quests.
---
do you guys log fights?
---
&gt;&gt;You're using the fact that a post generated conversation as a benchmark for whether or not it's worth keeping around.
---
&gt;It is a factor, yes. There's actually an entire subreddit dedicated to similar posts. It's thriving and quite popular.
---
That means it should be allowed in this sub? That's a stretch. 
---
&gt;&gt; Any thread will do that if given enough time, so it's a horrible metric to go by. 
---
&gt;lol no. Sort by new, bookmark a few and check back later to see what positive conversations have occurred.
---
&gt;&gt;No, it's not, see my previous comment. 
---
&gt;Your irrelevant nonsense still doesn't explain anything.
---
It's completely relevant and you're choosing to ignore it isn't going to make it go away. Keeping low-effort topics around solely because an argument, regardless of relation to the original topic, is asinine at best, horrible community moderation at worst. 
---
&gt;&gt;Doesn't mean that post should exist long enough for that to happen.
---
&gt;Hate to break it to you, but the majority of voting members of this sub strongly disagree with you.
---
Really? Sounds like a fun one to prove considering the comments in this thread and the fact it was so out of hand a mod had to side-track the thread to figure out how to clean it up going forward. 
---
"Majority of voting members".. the fuck out of here with that nonsense. This isn't some democracy lmao. 
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;This is all so far off the original discussion it's not funny. There are multiple sides to whether or not to remove it and deciding on one can cause chaos for the mods.
---
The original discussion is centered around providing 20 words or less to the mod on how to improve the state of the sub, which I have done and you apparently don't like my opinion. Oh well. :)
---
I still don't get where ethics comes into it, maybe with scammers you can argue ethics, but not WPVP.  Blizzard has built a (PvP) world where you can and are encouraged to kill each other.  People enjoy playing the game their own way, some like fishing some like ganking lowbies, I don't pretend to know why they think the way they do, but they do and I live within this world (when I login) so I play by the rules established by the God of this world (Activision-Blizzard) and acknowledge people are going to play a certain way.
---
The playerbase has not changed.  I got ganked to hell in Vanilla, BC and WOTLK (not so much in the xpacs after they killed the world though).  These people have always been around and we've always had to deal with them.  
---
The lowbies getting ganked are still going to get ganked by the same people -- because some people like fucking with people.  Again I don't understand why you would spend your time that way but I recognize it as something that's existed forever, so rather than apply my real world expectations of people into this game I assume they'll act like people who play this game.
---
You points about game design are very good though, that is why things are crazy to some people on some servers.  I don't think you could reduce the size of servers at this point but having lower populations might have prevented so much crazy world pvp -- the griefing however will never change; there are just people who are wired that way.
---
IMO if Activision-Blizzard was on its A game like back in 2004 Classic+ could provide some solutions.  However we've already experienced the homogenization of WoW and once was bad enough.  I am glad I learned the lessons I did from retail (Van,BC,WOTLK) to know that these types of people are much more common on horde.  If you can't beat em join em!

Heavily armored = garrote
---
Elemental and struggling = Cheap shot

If we are having an easy time and confident you can drop aggro = Ambush dagger macro
---
I love doing Mara runs and hearing the clap or garrote noise on opener... She's immune to both fam, just macro a dagger or rush in no stealth.
---
So they let you roll on a 2nd piece, subtract 10, and then still strongly try to tell you not to accept it even if you win?? I’d find that pretty uncomfortable.
---
My big reccomendations would be get mining / herb and do Hearthglen in WPL.
---
There are multiple sources of income, you can be semi-afk and theres plenty of pvp opportunity.

Sources:

* A lot of rich thorium nodes

* Dreamfoil nodes
---
* Three potentially locked chest locations that are easy to loot
---
* Four rares which have good loot tables
---
* Lock picking
---
* Crusader Ench farm from Spellbinders

That's just speculative and unverified. Most servers are blowing the 3k original limit way out of the water.

My guild wants me to go some version of 31/11/5 to raid in.  Is there any way to optimize this spec to be anything but a free honor kill in WPVP?  Like, how do I gear, play, etc?
---
I was planning on going 20/0/31 and picking up some improved buffs but still be able to hold my own in the cruel world, but they basically want a full buff bitch so that's not going to suffice.
---
Out of curiosity, why did spellcleaving not happen? You’d think 4 mages and a priest from a guild would have gotten together and at least tried it? I never played vanilla.
---
You can't give someone an item you rolled Need on I'm pretty sure.
---
Many pieces cost demonic ruins to make as well which is bop with a relatively low drop rate. Which is why they are so expensive.
---
I did I played on a private server for a bit, it wasn't this bad, but if it makes you feel better to think such a binary black and white way, do so.
---
The idea of dampening subsequent rolls is fine. The idea that you dampen rolls and then still encourage not taking items is dumb.
---
One or the other.

everything you did this week is lost
---
Oh shit. That sounds even scarier.
---
This is a very thoughtful answer and perspective i hadnt actually given much validity before. 
---
That being said...I think this cuts to players too. Many of us had our fix of griefing and being grief/zerged back in the old days. 
---
This isnt a unique problem and could have been avoided by not chosing a PVP server. If you dont like it dont play? My GF was bugged by this and shes coming back when BGs drop in a week. Ive been busy so putting off an honor grind till vacation. 
---
You bet id be out on my gnome killing horde left and right for honot if I had the time right now. Why? Because i rolled on a pvp server in full anticpation of a fact we all knew lol.
---
So you want the level 60s to leave you alone while you 2 shot level 33s? Are you being ignant on purpose?
---
I'm sure you live in a speedrunning bubble where everyone does that stuff...here's the thing: 99% or more of people that play this game don't, so be careful when using words like "most" when berating other people for playing differently than you.
---
People dont take too kindly to Horde viewpoints of the whole thing...
---
Fuck em that's why.

Use barkskin when rogues/warriors are on you.  Decreases the damage and crit damage.  Can also use while stunned.
---
Tried to restore my item that wasn't on the item restoration page and they told me to find something else to equip, tough luck.
---
As someone who is also kinda new to MC and has done a few runs, where are you using so many shards? Are you spamming shadowburn for dps? Maybe because healthstones are spread around in my raid but I only recall using like 10 shards at most.
---
Make a seperate sub for concerns and complaints and drama. Make this more like memes and created stuff and guides. That's what I'd like.
---
Since noone actually answered the question I'll tell you what I do.  I'll give you 2 lists, a BWL list and an AQ+ list.  These are differentiated due to mages swapping specs, as well as hunters losing their debuff as their damage falls off and their raid role changes to more utility.  MC is basically BWL without the Nightfall debuff.  Note, Thunderfury adds 2 debuffs, and is a great weapon for a casual guild but at the super top end, especially AQ+, guilds will opt to not use it.  It wastes 2 debuffs, makes the boss hit you 25% less for much less rage, and is worse than ACLG + double daggers (Especially once you have CThun dagger and pugios).  For that reason I have not included it in my list.
---
BWL:
---
Taunt
---
Sunder Armor
---
Faerie Fire
---
Curse of Recklessness
---
Curse of Elements
---
Curse of Shadows

Idk about enh or feral but caster hybrid dps can off heal when people are wiping or healers are low on mana. So long as they bring mana pots and demonic runes they dont run out of mana, and play an interesting role in progression you dont see often on the metres by switching roles as people die or run out of mana. But u dont hear these casual elitists mention this since they just regurgitate unkempt opinions without doing any research. They are viable, not competitive. The difference is less of a big deal outside of racing and world firsts.

I did it in mostly raid BiS with a perditions, but if you're sword spec you can likely get away with less. [This is a pretty solid guide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojlo66XC5qg)
---
Something I learned really really fast: bring major health potions, use them ANY TIME you think you might die, trash or boss. Same deal with cooldowns.. when clearing trash just use them. A corpse run costs more in repairs than a potion and takes longer than waiting for your cooldowns to come back up.
---
Otherwise just take it slow and steady. You'll probably die a couple times getting it down but it's really not that bad. The only issue you might have consistently is that RNG might screw you.. if angerforge lands two crits in a row you're pretty much dead. But by the time I got my trinket I hadn't died to him in many runs, so it just comes down to practice.
---
Oh and you do make some gold. Even buying the potions and such I needed I made about 120g from my runs. It's certainly not *good* gold per hour but it's a lot better than a loss.
---
No it’s not. This is flagrantly wrong.
---
i doom'd domo once for shits and giggles/intentional padding. no point. let my warrior know iw as doing it and i still got hit once lol.
---
I too played vanilla from launch and this is nothing like it. I love PvP and the world it creates. Getting camped was part of that.
---
This is 24/7 camping, I get the feeling it doesn't take OP 45 minutes to run to an instance and his FPs aren't dead 2/3s of the time. It's obvious wow was never designed for this volume of pvping players.
---
Yeah, MC is crazy easy to get into.  Talk to the elf, jump thru the window, heck jumping backwards from the top towards that lava fall will get you in.
---
I don't give a shit about "skill" in an MMORPG, I just want to collect gear, and kill people who are weaker than me. Its not a balanced game, and PvP battles are usually determined by who gets the jump anyways.
---
And tbh, I really like how the factions actually really hate each other again, after 15 years of pacifism on retail where nobody cared about wpvp, or the other faction.
---
Oh that's a really good tip, thank you!
---
Arrows pointing you towards quests makes exploring feel very different, but a lot of people use Questie to do the exact same thing, so it’s up to personal preference.
---
löl
---
Shadowburn really shouldn't be in your rotation unless shadow vulnerability is greater than 3.  Maybe as a finisher so you can get your shard back. 
---
Big ass soul shard bags are great for PVP though.
---
They don't call you a dick, but you still feel like one because you're put on the spot, "Okay it's going to you unless you'd like to pass since you won legs on the first boss" and you gotta be like, "Yeah....I'd still like to take them".
---
I was about ready to unsub until I saw you post.
---
If a mod cares that much, I'll say why to try and help. 
---
Too many posts of the same... 
---
Waaayyy too many posts about Spy.. They all say the same thing. It doesn't matter if you agree or disagree that Spy should be available, the 200th post about it and you thinking your opinion matters more or that you have a different take than the 199 before you is stupid. To me,to post that, just shows they don't ever look on these forums, don't know how to use the search feature, or are just trying to gain karma. Either way, they aren't a genius with a new idea about it.
---
Complaining about P2... Jfc we get it.. You've obviously seen the thousands of posts previous because you say, and I quote ... "Don't tell me pvp happened on a pvp server" or "don't tell me to reroll to pve" but they still think they'll bring something else to talk about that the 1000 people before them didn't. They wont
---
It wasn't like this at all 15 years ago.
---
When people say mages are better at escaping than warlocks, they are correct. 
---
However, warlocks don’t escape. They kill the ones trying to escape from THEM. #fact
---
what about weapons, rings and trinket (one PvP of course) then?
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
It is. Then you gotta say, "Yeah I'm still gonna take it..thanks."
---
Oh, scratch that, I misunderstood. With only 28 people in the raid a 1-phase rag kill is a tall order unless everyone's gear is very good. Nice job on the kill without a full raid.
---
This would just make me camp you more. Id rather you quit with that attitude.
---
I move we call this dedicated thread "The Daily Whinge."
---
Relog right before you rez, heard that gives you honorless debuff
---
I think the problem here is that if every player broadcasts messages at max allowed rate, it's still too much for the server to handle. You'd have to set the bar very low, blocking a lot of normal use cases.
---
Normally this is fixed by making the limit application (or addon) wide, but since addons are easily edited text files on client's PC this is not really possible.
---
He doesnt do it so fast, he is a loudmouth pleb. My guild does mc in 1:34 with full buffs and 40 people with no wipes. To do it in 55-70 minutes u need at least 7 fury warriors and sapper charges, i’ve seen it and khow its done. Hes a typical lying reddit trash.
---
&gt; I stopped when you marked 2 targets and had mage sheep one lol.
---
Something about this bothered you? What about marking 2 targets and polymorphing one is "lol"?
---
&gt; Right before, you LoS'd a single target.
---
What about this bothered you? I'll LoS a single target if that target is in a position that we might aggro other mobs while fighting it -- especially if I don't know the dungeon well (this was my first time in Cathedral).
---
&gt; you don't need to range single target pulls...
---
How many times do "single target pulls" turn into "clusterfuck" pulls? With a group of completely unknown players (of unknown competence, unknown temperament, etc.), I'd rather be overly cautious than wipe.
---
getting HYPED.
---
It's an unfortunate truth that raid spec and PvP spec aren't usually compatible.  As a battleground enthusiast and raid goer, I spent way too much gold on respec before they implemented dual spec swapping.
---
The volume IS the phenomenon that is the problem.
---
Tank warrior is actually not really wanted in a raid group. :( its hard to get a spot in a good raid
---
I'd be wary about letting locks apply corruption whenever they see &lt;16 debuffs on target. When improved shadow bolt procs when there are 15 or more debufffs it can potentially knock off more important stuff off, like winter's chill, instead of a dot. 
---
There's more discussion on the warlock discord in the #theorycrafting channel on this.  It seems there's some RNG on what gets knocked off in some circumstances even knowing there is some concept of debuff priority (i.e. we know sunder has prio over dots, and weapon procs like annhilator are lower). 
---
For this reason, I would suggest you only assign a single SM/ruin warlock to run corruption.  If you carefully review logs and never or very rarely see 15+ debuffs, don't have a shadow priest using SWP, etc., you might be able to run two, but I don't think any more is worth the risk of popping something else off.  
---
If people are being dumb/jealous about the parse and on who gets to use corruption or not (or who is getting power infusion, etc) they should be told they're dumb and that raid is a team sport, and any loot council should take into account who is getting power infusion and corruption before they claim a player is doing better or worse than others.
---
Runeblade is ridiculously OP due to its snapshotting your +healing when you equip it.  That means you effectively have a major healing pot every 5 seconds
---
Baron cape in run 1, greatsword in run 2. dreadsteed run 3?
---
sick info dude. ima try this out on tuesday. much obliged.
---
I used to... use it as a filler when I was moving, and I also raided with more locks so getting shadow vuln stacks were never a problem.
---
Its not a spell I like using,but since you specc it anyways and it does increase your DPS on rush fights, its probably the biggest reason to even have a soulbag.
---
For frost mages Cabal shoulders and Ringo boots are &gt;~ the PvP blues even with the set bonus. I haven't run the calculations for fire but I can see the set bonus likely does push them above BWL gear (so I'll probably have to grind all the way to 10—damn). Still, 2 slots out of 15 for the top few percent of PvPers isn't likely to make a huge difference.
---
I think others have pretty much corrected you, but if not allow me to jump in as well: 
---
There's multiple guilds, on most likely the vast majority of servers, who are running 2 raid teams. Your "average" raiding guild will have 50-60 raiders to account for no shows, split Ony's, etc., so making the jump to 80-100 isn't much of a stretch from there.
---
Sounds like they want a +1 system for pugs but want to leave the door open for them/their friends go “be that guy” and take whatever they can. Move on.
---
Fair enough, just seemed mock-y for no good reason. All good though.
---
At this point I don’t think they even care I’m 20 deaths into the 4 death 0 honor bit. Just want to camp you to be bastards. Over 40 people have stopped playing from our guild. It’s ruining the server.
---
Just out of curiosity... you play a lot less now bc you’ve “adapted” or irl stuff. 
---
A lot of us are “adapting” by playing much much less.
---
Your response, and the replies to it, make perfectly good sense. The only problem with it is that in this level range, outside of mages and locks casting aoe, a warrior with either ww axe or ravager should have no problem holding aggro. What I’ve seen lately, is a lot of warriors that don’t understand the huge dps gain (threat gain) that comes when you don’t sit in defensive stance casting cleave every 3.7 seconds and filling the gaps with sunder armor. I am seeing a large number of warriors who are just wanting to make sure they have a spot in groups and use their half assed toolkit to tank dungeons. Obviously you should keep a shied and sword which are really easy to pick up in the late 30s. This should be used once aggro is picked up and should be macrod to switch between sword and board and your 2h. 
---
I (42 warrior) ran ulda last night with a 49 warrior who had (Bonebiter? 45 dps and a bleed?) and I continuously took aggro against level 45 mobs. This makes no sense so I looked into the details and sure enough, the warrior was only using cleave and sweeping strikes even when fighting more than 3 mobs. I mean cmon, I’ll get downvoted for saying it but if you’re going to tank, you’re expected to lead the dungeon. You are supposed to know the somewhat ins and outs of the dungeon (the very few actually necessary in classic). This includes how to generate threat. This is why warrior tanks at 60 stick with a build that focuses on dealing damage because having threat and a SINGLE place for your healers to heal, is much more beneficial than not having threat, having all the defensives in the world, and your healers healing a lot more people than needed. 
---
TLDR: Warriors need to learn to actually do aoe damage if they’re going to tank because people are getting sick of the “DPS CLasSeS ArE EviL” Meta that’s going on in classic dungeons. Threat and pace are everything in leveling dungeons.
---
There is a pretty hard hitting staff in Zul'Farrak. 3.6 swing speed, high dmg, on hit effect (stun). Staffs are overlooked a lot of times but make great weapons for warriors.
---
I believe you meant to say Sunder Armour and Overpower are the main skills, Mortal Strike is bad for anything other than dumping rage.
---
Just a quick note: I've never said the playerbase has changed. Quite the opposite in fact. Blizzard has changed the game because of the actions of the players. The amount of policing necessary to curb exploits, win trading, collusion for resource control, some types of griefing, etc etc is beyond reasonable. 
---
Many of these are things that are possible with the design of the game yet still explicitly against ToS. So for me it's not really adequate to just say it's by design.

Lol. Strategy. Lul

Idk if /s or not, but I was kinda being serious.
---
Rend is bottom of the barrel in all of: threat per rage, threat per second, damage per rage
---
It has two uses: PvP dot and a very fringe use case for like a mob that gouges you, the tick will bring them back to you without having to go collect em again
---
Rage is normalized. Speed doesn't matter, damage does.
---
Don’t forget Costco has good sales on blankets this time of year. Will keep you warm on mommy’s basement where the heat doesn’t work as well.
---
Accurate as hell.
---
Its a repeatable quest that allows you aoe a room over and over again which grants crazy XP. You can literally do it from 51-60.
---
Hunter Aura doesn't stack with GotW, Shaman totem, or elixir of Magic Resistance.  Even assuming you have perfect hunter dispels above 30%, a full GNPP going into 30% and the cooldown up for a second GNPP, you will still get curbstomped.  Remember that half the melee are perma stunned aswell, and cannot pop their second GNPP.  Also, multiple ranged get silenced (I think 3 at a time for 10 seconds every 20 seconds, not sure I played fury), so healers are hard CC'd.  The tank also takes insane damage through last stand, lifegiving, and wall.

today was the first time ive had fun pvping in the open world as alliance on my server.  recently turned 58 and i have a few pieces of pre-raid BiS.  have been able to successfully 1v1 a handful of horde 60s that i have ran across in the wild.
---
flight paths are still camped to hell though.
---
Well you are either MT or you better roll dps...
---
Outnumbered faction will have instant bg queues though while the other faction will have to wait forever.
---
Fury horde side fairbanks (skarm's guild) has 8 raid teams. They are building a 9th now.

Tell me about it, trying to get into BRD currently and getting insta killed on spawning **as a rogue.** Game is a literal joke atm.

History has not repeated at all with classic so there's no reason to think it will here. Pservers has been completely accurately predicted every player behavior including how people will play AV.

If it's the same group yeah they don't.. I feel your pain on a similar server as alliance

Makes me feel a smidge better to deny the honor at least

My prediction is the exact opposite. Premades in BiS gear will farm graveyards. It will depend on the amount of honor you get for winning against the amount of time you have to wait in queues, but if you can get a steady steam of enemy fill-ins, you can just hold the flag all day and farm honor.
---
It's almost as if negativity in the game causes negativity in forums about the game.
---
Perhaps not, but logging out certainly doesn't do jack shit to help either.
---
honorless does nothing unfortunately they kill before they even have chance to check.
---
Back in the day there were a mix of different realm types in each battlegroup
---
Using a sapper on a densely occupied boat as it changes zones as a solo player yields about 40 honor per kill. Using it on people rezzing at half health gotta be ~80 per. That's pretty good value if you ask me!
---
You keep talking like it's game time only that matters. It's been months, they *clearly* don't have time to reroll and churn out 30 levels.. it will very likely take them another three months.
---
No matter where you are in game time investment, losing months of your personal progress in a game sucks. Just because someone else could get to that point in a couple days doesn't make that any less so.
---
20/0/31 would be your best bet, they're trying to get you to do Wisdom, Kings and Might, just unreasonable. Have another Holy or Prot pally grab kings... You only need down to Illumination in Holy. https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/550031105--502050512023051 is good so you can provide Might, and when you are solo/pve-farming you can run a strong Ret aura+wisdom to sustain farm.
---
This offense should be instant suspension. You know exactly it's an exploit but DECIDED anyways to do it. Hk farmers, you pieces of shiiits, I like how they try to reason it's for gear but at the end they're ruining the subs exp. What's the point of farming hks  if you're going to cause the decline of number of subscriptions and blizzards haven't done shiit to minimize the damage done by this scums.
---
As a druid, I wish I only had one set with me.
---
Underrated xD
---
No, if you use logic most people couldn’t make videos in 2004-2006 as it was a luxury to be able to play and record WoW on a Pc unless you had a powerful computer. So less videos are going to be online. But YouTube Vanilla banking and you’ll find proof of it. A lot of accounts over the last 13 years have been lost to time, wiped or repurposed so videos have been scrubbed clean off the internet...
---
My final thoughts, gaming culture has changed and players are better, so ganking is more easily recorded. Also large scare Zergs are easier since everyone’s pc can handle all the AoEs and such better +Discord helps organize everyone better. Unfortunately more players choose Horde so no amount of balancing will ever be a thing, and a 1:1 ratio is impossible standard to reach. Even 60:40 isn’t that bad considering that a lot of players are in capitols, our questing and those numbers include alts so it’s not a fair number to judge. So please just PvP on the server or go to PvE where PvP is toggleable. Unfortunately in ANY game with PvP you will have gankers and the like.
---
i farm rfk for small radiant shards as a rogue. i get a pretty consistent 16 per 5 runs, which gets me to instance cap, fastest run ive done there is 7:30. i sell them \~2g/ea so its a very simple 30g for 40-50 minutes of work. never did brd pockpicket cuz when i started this shards were selling 3-4g and i made hella bank real fast, but its still worth doin imo. nice casual way to start or end a play session.
---
 this is a farm i figured out on my own so idk if theres any videos showing pathing and stuff
---
I love how horde players, especially Americans think such a binary and egocentric way. "HURR DURR  you "chose" this'
---
I expect wPvP to become less shallow and binary (like it was in phase 1, which had a lot more depth) after BGs are released, as the private server's I played a bit on had already released them and I enjoyed those.
---
And? i'm not saying warriors are better farmers than warlocks or something. i'm just pointing out that A. hes making it sound like warriors can't farm gold for shit and have little to no options to and B. he is exaggerating how much gold and how easy it is for a warlock to make it
---
fury/prot warrior can farm raid and even pvp (badly) with that spec. a warlock CAN farm as raid spec, at least SM/Ruin, but it isn't ideal and sometimes its worth specifically respeccing to DS/SM to farm, which is useless for literally everything except farming dungeons.
---
YOU CAN KEYBIND MARKINGS?! Jsndneksnxndmsmdnndn
---
I dont see a need for ui changes, everything thats needed is there, any updates would probably be whatever but it seems uneccesary. The only thing I can think of is having the key ring, which is in the UI but also a bag of sorts so idk.
---
They didn't bring back the old addon/macro system that would allow 1 button play because it would be a disaster, and they changed it despite #nochanges and that was the right choice. 
---
The current pvp system is another example of a disaster that should not have been reproduced, but it happened.   Game design is hard, but it's not this hard.  This could have been avoided.

TBC was a pretty nice balance between vanilla and wotlk. It was a logical extension of vanilla: Classes worked well, while still being unique and having strengths and weaknesses. "meme specs" were finally raid viable, doing an okay amount of DPS and bringing some good raid utility, like spriests being a mana battery for healers, Ele shamans bringing spell crit, Paladins bringing increased crit chance on targets, etc.
---
WOTLK took it too far and started homogenizing classes, giving everyone AoE, giving more classes self-heals, making tanking braindead-easy, making healer mana management not matter, etc.
---
So, at least, for class mechanics/balance, going with what TBC had would be the best bet there.
---
On a few fights you can min/max by pulling your felhunter out for consume magic.  But yeah, curse and bolt spam is 95% of MC.
---
Yeah, I absolutely despise dungeon journal and dungeon maps. That ruins the game so much for me.
---
Even after 15 years, I still get lost in BRD, WC, or Mauradon. So I have to go explore, and look for the bosses, and when the tanks decide to take different routes you get to see the dungeons from different angles. Altough the dungeons from TBC - current retail are linear, I still dislike it.
---
I also don't like the journal, to see every boss, all their abilities, their model and loot even stepping into the dungeon, its just so lame.
---
Don't get defensive, I learned to tank from getting shit from groups.  I think you have a great base and discipline.  You just need to get a little more aggressive.  The discipline you show will help you from clusterfuck pulls.  The problem with clusterfucks tho is that they aren't from the pull, they're from fear or an enemy launching you into another group.
---
Like I said, you have a great base, just build on that.  You should macro charge with bloodrage.

You either die an MT or you live long enough to become an MT.

Yep, removing racial slurs because I'm a nazi.
---
Opposite actually, they get full benefit from +dmg due to their duration.  Instant cast would only matter for damaging instants like fire blast and shadowburn.

I use the holy yellow star of healing to mark my healer so I can quickly locate them in a pack and around corners.
---
OK, this one is fair lol...
---
You're perfectly welcome to leave the group if I (or any tank) is moving too slow for you. But no one in this instance gave any advice to go faster; no one complained I was too slow. Also, anyone is perfectly welcome to tank if they feel they can do it better. I can warrior DPS.

Tbh it was pure luck that I happened to pan my camera over my shoulder. Caught him closing in from about 40 yards away

I was riding through sillithus to my remote as fuck soul shard farming location and spy popped up with 4 alliance players, one of them is a bot I regularly encounter in this area (a hunter just grinding mobs) so I head over and see 3 mounted players riding around the bot, one of them rides in my direction so I wave at him and point at the bot, he points at me and nods so I go over and kill it while the 3 /cheer

we have p2 after all and I was standing amongst 3 alliance players who still get 100% honor for me so I emoted /ready and awaited death but to my surprise they each did a 1v1 with me and then let me be

---
It snapshots when you equip it. Put on plus healing gear then that. Then your regular gear. My guildy gets like 100 hp per sec. Its dumb
---
Ruin doesn't add crit%, it increases damage when you do crit.
---
&gt; and you consider dark rune farming a good reason to keep 5 man relevant.
---
Dark Runes are only part of the drops that people are farming from instances.  I've listed a few and there are many more I haven't touched on.  Recipes, patterns, plans, etc, all are farmable in various instances, along with the materials for them.  People in full AQ gear will be farming various 5 mans.  The frequency may drop off and they may be only guild runs but the fact remains that once you finish BiS for the tier of content, 5 man instances will still be run.  They don't magically lose all relevance because you have full purples.
---
&gt; guess we'll find out in 8 days! tell me how your pugging experience in WSG goes!
---
Thanks, I guess?  I've never disputed power level differences nor the prevalence of higher geared players.  I'm also not naive enough to think that R10 groups will be common when WSG goes live next week, as that is impossible due to the grind time.  And R13 won't be achieved until late January at the earliest, if that.  I'm going to enjoy my time pugging, playing the game and doing my best.  I'm also going to enjoy going outside and doing things instead of slaving away at the honor system, hating myself and everyone I'm playing with.  Let me know how your grind to 14 goes in March when you've burned out because there are more try hards than you thought there were.
---
Nobody is going to do that
---
LOL...well played!  Only blight was the home GP which was also the most entertaining!
---
TL;DW: Level 1s have the best stat scaling in the game, even though the only way they can get bonus stats are from Enchants and buffs from higher-level characters.
---
&gt; because I'm waiting for the healer with 40% mana to start drinking.
---
As a healer main, I just want to remind druids and warriors that using the enrage abilities to generate rage puts you in combat and if we have a renew or aoe heal on you at the end of the fight, we're stuck in combat and can't even start drinking until the buff expires.

I can confirm it's 20 HP every 5 seconds.

I said if you're not open to advice I'd dip.  Check out my other response, it could be helpful.

Not /s I actually appreciate it as a noob tank, I’ve been sorting everything because I thought the extra threat helped
---
Vanilla was very much alliance dominant so much to the point that they over buffed horde racials to try attract players or give them a handicap, i cant remember which.
---
That only requires rank 10, which long term is achievable by many.  And you use shoulders + boots over cabal + t2.5 for +1 crit -9 damage, which is a really good trade for fire.
---
You could be playing the game how you want it to be though. And other people can play it how they wanted it to be.

We have a similar experience over on Shazzrah EU. Around 100-200 Horde inside BRM on any given evening. My guild has three raid nights and they are ALWAYS there even when I try to go do a 5-man dungeon on an non-raid day.
---
Get some deviate delights and you can change it on-the-fly.
---
Init
---
On horde you do that quest and you have to deliver the runes one by one to someone in azshara, and someone in each capital, and then return. There might not be many quests in Azshara but they are like xp bombs and always worth doing with the drop rates in the zone 😁
---
Glad it worked out and the tale had a happy ending
---
I think WSIP wednesday is kind of useless 3 months into classic. There's not a lot of stuff to discuss in a reddit thread on what you should play, when you can probably just search up every class and get a pretty detailed video in just a few minutes.
---
I make an /assist (tank) macro on my rogue and hunter and tie it to the one key. If you tell all your DPS to do that then your pugs should run smoother.
---
I'm pretty sure [this blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/honor-calculations/364258/174) from 2 days ago confirmed it's a visual bug and should be fixed today/tomorrow
---
Brain dead horde is 2 honor really worth destroying the server.. they will be the ones raging when the server dies
---
Gives me hope of not having to respec out of my current 0/30/21 enh/resto bastard spec when I finally start raiding.
---
You had me at Ironforge is under attack, lol.
---
So it’s your fault
---
The hot it puts on you scales 100% with +sp/+healing
---
Pickpocketing here and there is fine and all but I have never come close to making what I do Mining / Herbing.
---
Dammit man, I didn't come here to feel.
---
Your art is awesome!
---
This had more Gnome story progression than the official stuff from the last couple of years.
---
You mean you don't like it when tanks micro-manage every aspect of the group??
---
Ok, zoomer
---
It's one of those rare people who rolled on a PvE server and really wanted a PvP server so he just roleplay that shit
---
“Reroll on PVE lol”
---
Says the horde. Stop blindly pretending that the current state of the game isn’t super unhealthy and broken. This is NOT how it’s supposed to be and saying otherwise is being intentionally disingenuous or naive.
---
Then something like 2-3 weeks.
---
That’s a hard argument to make for a game that requires a monthly subscription though. 
---
If I’m paying $15 a month for a game, with the assumption that I’ll play for a few hours every few days, then it fucking blows when in one of those hour chunks I do have to play the best advice is ‘it’s not worth playing now, log off and do something else’
---
Like so why am I paying a subscription 
---
With any other game it would be fine, with the assumption that yeah I’ll come back later and eventually be able to enjoy it
---
With WoW? Yeah that blows
---
ahh thankyou, that makes sense, and where would be a good contested area to get fights on a lvl 19?
---
UNLESS you make a funny little Spongebob meme about that asshole streamer who ninja’ed some stuff. 
---
Then the mods come goosestepping in with their brown shirts on screaming NEIN!!!
---
I have 40 days /played on my priest. A little hard to abandon.
---
Same. I tried to transfer a day ago. My only options were to two west coast pvp servers and one east coast pvp. AND I’m pretty sure the reason blizzard has locked me into those three specific servers is bc their population decline/imbalance must be worse than mine. Fuk that!
---
DejaClassicStats
---
I just got to 60, and I started 2 months ago. No way in hell I'm going to do that all over again.
---
Just keep getting better bud!  I think it's pretty damn cool you play with your son.
---
As for the macro, just get rid of that first /cast Battle Stance line.  I literally use that macro 100 times a day haha.  As for stance dancing, I macro my abilities like this...
---
&gt;\#showtooltip Overpower  
---
&gt;/cast Battle Stance  
---
&gt;/cast Overpower
---
&gt;\#showtooltip Revenge  
---
&gt;/cast Defensive Stance  
---
&gt;/cast Revenue
---
&gt;\#showtooltip Whirlwind  
---
&gt;/cast Berserker Stance  
---
&gt;/cast Whirlwind
---
Then I just stance dance with those set to hotkeys on my mouse.  If you don't have the rage to cast the ability, or an enemy didn't dodge, you can still use them to dance around.
---
Shut ur turkey neck lookin ass up boi
---
I'll beat the shit outta you
---
I was a 'carry a couple - never more than 6 in a regular bag' warlock, figuring the extra 10 or so slots for loot was a way better trade off than losing a whole bag slot. 
---
I tried out a 20 slot soul bag and I'm never going back. With PvP times, and all my abilities online like Shadowburn I use heaps. If I ever have less than 10 now I feel anxious.
---
Horde pvp population is overwhelmingly bigger on most of the servers, so Horde will have Queue times 5x longers. 
---
You'll see.
---
BGs will be cross-realm, which should make queues shorter
---
I think it's kinda fun to watch. Seemed like all the pvpers were so stoked for phase 2 and world pvp, now every 3rd post or so is just whining and crying about world pvp. Brilliant. 
---
You're holding your hand in a fire and complain that it's burning you
---
Yeah because clearly in 2019 the best way to discuss an idea or to raise awareness about how a game community is feeling is through email... 
---
Fuck that toxic attitude. No wonder this game is currently fucked up if it is played by people thinking in a rushy and simplistic way like yours. I'm juste glad there are still some altruistic and empathic people out here
---
For sure, and they can start by enforcing the rules already in place.  That'd be a good start.
---
I actually do think that people on the dominating faction have easier time leveling thus probably are more inclined to do so. But you're right, I didnt really think that one through and even though ut does affect the ratio its probably only marginal.
---
Nagas drop the good shit! Got an epic mace off of those Nagas and they always be giving out golden pearls!
---
Just change the name to r/classicwowmemes and be done with it becasue thats 95% of the content
---
I don't have any problem with what you wrote except that you don't seem open to the idea that there's more than one way to play.  I also tanked as a 2H arms warrior up until 60.  Sometimes it works, sometimes you have to go back to sword and board.  The idea that there is One True Way is a problem.  Whether it's your way or the OP's way.  As the tank, you have to adapt to the group's capabilities and proclivities.  
---
&gt; This is why warrior tanks at 60 stick with a build that focuses on dealing damage because having threat and a SINGLE place for your healers to heal, is much more beneficial than not having threat, having all the defensives in the world, and your healers healing a lot more people than needed.  
---
Warrior tanks at 60 do all kinds of different things.  Not sure what you're talking about here.
---
&gt; they notice when they kill you and it doesn't say they gained any honor.
---
They MIGHT notice this... after you're dead.
---
They're probably not going to understand what's going on, especially if they don't read this "helpful tip". I know I'd chalk it up to some weird goof in the honor system.
---
Even if they do understand, they're probably not going to care (especially since you're often not the only target).
---
Bottom line: This is going to stop approximately zero people from camping you.
---
so you havent played in the server and rely on 3rd party statistics that may not even be that accurate. ok.
---
&gt;if implemented how does your idea differ substantially then the current PvE servers?
---
It will at least confine PVP to people who are within a level range of each other. I don't see why everyone is so against fights having to be somewhat fair. Everyone is baffled by the thought of having to fight someone around their own level. 
---
&gt;Currently grey characters don't give honor so the only reason to kill them is in order to create nonconsensual pvp which is ENTIRELY THE POINT of the pvp servers rule set. Remember, the pvp servers were created to appeal to people who played games like UO, MUDS or EQ pvp servers, they were not created for the general gaming audience. It's unfortunate that so many people were talked into picking the wrong server type but I don't think essentially removing PVP servers is the answer.
---
The "PVP" that occurring now isn't the type you want happening in any sort of MMO.
---
&gt;I think blizzard should offer free transfers and then merge the remaining servers into the most equal things they can create but that ship might be too far sailed at this point.
---
And if everyone followed the advice of everyone telling them to go PvE, PVP servers will be dead. They are all already one-sided messes with an overall horde majority across them all. Everyone wanting to PvE in the world will transfer. Everyone that wants to do PvP will stay but do BGs where horde will have horrible queues.
---
If nobody else has Nightfall, like you absolutely should have as enhancement by P3 if you want to PVE, then you proc that pretty well.
---
Because it does 30%+ more damage per swing. 70 average damage per swing for the staff vs 53 for the axe.
---
The slower the weapon, the more bursty it is, and the more damage you can frontload right away.
---
Ret pally is BiS Alliance side Nightfall wielder DPS-wise. If you want Nightfall in your raid (and you probably do) - might as well squeeze some DPS out of it.
---
Easy report easy ban when someone calls for your extermination
---
Damn! So it’s my attitude that’s causing me to corpse run 10 times to brd. Thanks man!! Fuk why isn’t this a BLUE POST!!!
---
Yeah that lists all NA servers.
---
Haha done! Less of a vent more of a god damn plea to stop it..
---
And this gives us for good point to roll a Horde. NOT
---
Big yikes there bud. Have fun in runescape or whatever.
---
Do we know if the AV we are getting will have the black lotus spawns? Hoping that might make flasking more accessible.
---
It's so we can kill them again quicker
---
Why are we delusional for thinking playing WoW for 6 - 7 hours a day is a lot?
---
I think the warriors charge of intercept stun component also does that.
---
What faction and server are you on?
---
I forget if Westfall is ally or contested. If it's ally though maybe try Redridge or Ashenvale but you'll encounter people a bit higher than you. Pretty (like a few levels) soon your quest pathing will bring you and alliance together in contested zones though so you might just wait until then.
---
Not* allowed
---
I didn't realize for a long time there was a second flight path in moonglade for non-druids. In my defense, most classes only have to go to moonglade once.
---
Nah. MMOs are dead.
---
But I love my CSGO
---
You're also assuming that people are going to notice in the first place. Keep in mind that the honorless debuff isn't visible.
---
&gt;A good raid comp saves time.
---
As we all now by now, "a good raid comp" means at least 50% of raid are warriors. Either you get benched (if not warrior) or you roll for your gear against 19 other warriors.
---
The GM who restored my items said something along the lines "usually we dont restore items but as these items are important items and only obtainable through a quest once we make an exception this time."
---
Technically mages press 2 buttons.  1 to nuke everything,  2 to make some of that free water.
---
if every other warrior has imp battleshout, why do I need imp battleshout?

---
best place to farm honor as a non stealthie?
---
Use Fiery Weapon on all your weapons until you get Thrash Blade, which you should enchant with Crusader.
---
I'm leveling a rogue right now and my weapon progression has been:
---
Wingblade (WC quest)
---
Outlaw Sabre (BFD quest)
---
Zealot Blade (lvl 29 BoE)
---
Sword of Omen (SM quest, use this in offhand)
---
Vanquisher Sword (RFD quest)
---
Hand of Righteousness (SM cath drop)
---
Thrash Blade (Maraudon quest, enchant with crusader, will last you until 60)
---
Sounds good, will lower the amount of roaming death squads
---
Just re roll an alt, to an ally friendly server like ashbringer, I did and it's a great server for ally
---
In retail, co-workers wanted alliance and wouldn't budge....so I made a draenei
---
I never said an enhancer's Nightfall uptime was zero. It's just far than that of a hunter spamming Rank 1 Wing Clip or a 2h fury warrior doing his rotation.
---
Also the only alts it would count would be ones showing up in raid logs, so they're gonna be at least in the mid to high 50s. Ironforge isn't counting bank alts and stuff. 
---
I've yet to see a decent explanation as to why Ironforge isn't the best way to gauge ratios (not overall numbers). Maybe allow the standard margin of error but beyond that? The other guy is just literally pushing inaccurate data and given that he has failed to respond about it at all, I'm pretty sure its willful ignorance at this point and not just being mislead.
---
That tunnel from Ashenvale to Stonetalon is a pretty good chokepoint too IMO
---
*cries in feral*
---
I'm stupid-blaming
---
That coincided with layering dying.
---
It's not that the spawn rate was increased (1 hour in vanilla, 1 hour in classic), but that they got rid of a temporarily decreased spawnrate.
---
Although there may be better statted items for hunters when it comes to their MS, twisted chanters staff is the most efficient out of all the 2hs as it has a lot of raw stat value and also hits harder than any agi wep you can get at that level. 
---
It also gives you enough int to spam our skills, meaning your other pieces of gear don’t need to have any int on them (or you don’t specifically NEED int).
---
They actually went down a little on our server (from like 90 to 65). As long as people have stocks it will stay in check, but that won't last long once P3 is out.
---
correct
---
Lol. He’s probably on some kinda watch list already
---
The people that murder you while you’re an honorless target are often fully aware. They aren’t killing you for honor, they will slaughter you regardless.
---
TIL No one cares about my heals :*(
---
Thanks. I use these same macros. Not to sound snarky, but I do know how to stance dance -- I just don't like that I have to :-D  I wish abilities were not restricted to certain stances.
---
It is. I have judgement pants too.
---
Imagine spending this much time drawing cartoon girls from your favorite video game and shilling for money on Reddit 😬😬😬
---
If I Remember that from my vanilla days, the key is indeed to attack his mana supply.
---
My current favorite past-time is telling people "Sounds like there's PvP on a PvP Server." I love it because its true and it seems to trigger people sooooo much. I get that it sucks and that I'm smart for rolling on a PvE server where I deal with 0 problems that everyone else is. I basically feel like a rich oligarch with all my buds in a PvE castle laughing at everyone killing themselves in the courtyard below us, them plebs on PvP Servers. They had the chance to get into the castle but decided they wanted to fight it out to be the courtyard king, instead of being in the castle where everyone is happy and we make each other friendship bracelets. Until the Alliance invite us to small skirmishes which we happily battle and everyone gets a taste of PvP and get some HK's. Can't wait till BG's come out and I can PvP much more often though. But still very glad I can run around Blackrock mountain with zero fear of being mind controlled into the lava.
---
Gear limits(and player availability) is definitely a consideration in raid comp. There are several DPS classes that are close enough that they are worth bringing.
---
Fortunately, we haven't been desperate enough we need to bring along a boomkin or ret pally.
---
Very well done! Subscribed!
---
Not bad advice. Before I started healing full time I would just say to the party that I was going to be rolling on healing/caster gear no one needed. Didn't take long to build a somewhat decent set.
---
I just watched a 15 minute video of you not doing any of these things, but ok!
---
From a fellow machinimator, I love it. Great attention to detail, and I know how much passion goes into these things. I always wonder what programs different people use for 3D animating old models. I’m guessing you used Blender? I usually use 3ds Max but could never get old models to work in anything other than Blender. Of course, I’m only an amateur.
---
Anyone who knows anything about Philosophy would agree with you, however, that's exactly why I feel this post will unfortunately end up only preaching to the choir. Most of the people being whooshed by it are already attempting to discredit it and make fun of it, which is of course tragic since many of us want this game to thrive.
---
I know a lot of people who camp bodies until they are worth 0% honor and then they leave them alone
---
We've got some baby steps to help with this in the works, I think, based on some of the feedback here. Sorry for being vague, but until it's up and running I don't want to make any promises.
---
No it hasn't

Damage has a chance to dismount doesn't it?
---
Generally a full healer will be better than a hybrid spec and full dps better than a meme spec.
---
Also enh shamans bring no extra utility.
---
I'm on the less dominant faction and yea it sucks sometimes, but there are ways to avoid it - although it's always going to happen, there are strategies to hopefully not let it happen as much.
---
As for aoe farming, are there not instanced spots you can try?
---
Blasted Lands, altar of storms.  Pretty low HP cloth wearing humanoids, drop runecloth/major pots and decent silver every kill. No one is ever there.  Just don't attack the "servant of sevine" mobs (there are 2 of them there) unless you are on the quest "The Stones that Bind Us", otherwise you won't be able to kill them.
---
If you can make it to Deadmines that place has a lot of good starter gear for lvl 20ish rogues. SFK has the two daggers that are amazing at 19 but they're rare BoE and also sell for a ton for BG twinks. 
---
If you go swords then the RFD and SM quest swords are amazing around lvl 30, Thrash Blade from Mara quest at 45. 
---
Those are the basic essentials. 
---
Pro-tips for other shit - 
---
Get some underwater breathing pots for lvling lockpicking. 
---
Always pickpocket human mobs before you kill while questing for lockboxes to lvl as you go. 
---
Instant poisons are all you need for lvling.

How much gold it is gonna cost if they want to continue raiding post mc and especially post bwl.

Sure, and that is fine. Just don't make up shot on reddit trying to say ret pallies are good lol.

Dude this is absolutely hilarious !

Thank you for making this :)
---
Appreciate this
---
Going to like your video because of it
---
You just saved that dude 15 bucks a month. He should send you a pizza.
---
if you have grenades, rocket helm, net projector, you can escape many 1v1s while farming.
---
Read the Tl Dr because quoting philosophy on reddit is about as useful as pissing in the wind.
---
Yes the community are murder hobos, no this post wont change anything, battlegrounds might, move on and wait a week.
---
Yes, but it's entirely Blizzard's choice how they wanted to release the content. They created this problem by not releasing BGs alongside Honor.
---
WHAA DONT KILL ME OR I LEAVE SERVER WHAAA
---
Whats the point of having alliance players if you can't kill them?
---
Lmao dude if you can’t kill a pally in classic uninstall.
---
Was fine to me and I was on pretty much all day. And I’m constantly on a bank alt about every hour that’s parked in if
---
Not really sure where you coming from. I got about 80 pvp kills. As of a few weeks ago blaumeux was like 48/52% horde. (Could be inaccurate now). Hella tired of complaints about wpvp when bg being released early. If youre unhappy reroll, take a break, or quit.
---
I’ve got 2 60s on here and a great guild, but it’s making a lot of people not want to play.. I know I rolled pvp and a few scraps is fine, I even don’t care if they farm me 4 times but after the 20th time, when I’m worth no honor. It’s just brutal.
---
If you are on a PVE server then its sadism, I love seeing all the people who were warned about PVP servers and still rolled on em.
---
I’ll get those eventually, but having them wouldn’t stop me from trying for t0.  I want them all.  I even intend to complete the 0.5 quest chain just because.
---
Not funny
---
It's BiS PvP weapon for enh/retri. Warriors are much better with BRE.
---
Yeah Bloodvine is in ZG phase
---
Ayyyy repping that DoD baby! Look at that cute ass dead MT in awe of the horde!
---
I type everyone need and roll need. If someone cries then I just ignore them.
---
I mean
---
&gt;both your guilds are straight up trash and ill fuck up both of yall on some 1v1 shit.
---
didn't give that away already?
---
"PvP is happening on a PvP server!!! Game is unhealthy and broken!!!" 
---
Expecting this NOT to happen on pvp servers is also pretty naive. Just because your expectations don't match the current state of pvp servers doesn't mean they're broken, it just means you had unrealistic expectations in the first place.
---
r/uselesscomments
---
That's because the rich have convinced a fuck-ton of people that being left isn't about redistributing the societal resources more humanly and evenly instead of allowing them to accrue to ridiculous numbers in the hands of a few psychopaths but rather that being left is only about colour of baby clothes or preferred pronouns. (do note, I'm not opposed to people wanting to change those norms, btu they are Not the most important issues of our times).  
---
I don't know how many conversations I've had with people that goes like   
---
"so what do you want?"   
---
"I want *A*".  
---
"Ok here is A"  
---
"No I hate that!"   
---
"Why?"  
---
"Because someone told me that this is bad."  
---
"But it's exactly what you said you want?"  
---
"No. I want *A*"    
---
"But this is *A*"    
---
"Maybe, but I don't want that."    
---
etc...
---
While there are more of them because of the honor. They will kill and camp even after 4 kills. Never will a horde player go “ oh killed this dude already 4 times. Let him go folks and by folks I mean all 40 of you”
---
They had (Nost) 8-10K concurrent with some varying systems. Let's take farming mats for example. Black Lotus had a 15 minute respawn or something else really short on private servers. This suited the population better as there were more readily available materials, and the mats were still rare by comparison to other more common mats. Black Lotus in Classic has a 2 hour respawn timer, with comparable levels of concurrent players, maybe less than private servers. BL is VERY rare and thus VERY expensive in Classic.
---
Take world buff cooldowns as well, they are much longer than they are in private servers, and while this is accurate, it doesn't accommodate the playerbase that is on a typical Classic server.
---
Take into account the lack of necessary changes that would of made P2 way less cancerous, like Honor gear that is not so good that it invalidates raid content until Naxx, and you've got a Classic experience that doesn't correctly emulate Vanilla, or at the very least, doesn't emulate what made pservers fun enough to play for 12 years.
---
I don't think the Nost team advised Blizzard to have high pop caps. I think Blizzard was trying to not have 50+ servers per region at launch for people to choose from, hence why Layering was so important for them. This is on Blizzard. The flighting they performed was far more exclusive than it should have been. With a version of Classic that is 1-40, free, and on the BNet client, they'd of understood far more accurately the degree to which they needed to work on Classic's server structure and server caps.
---
X
---
But even if you're correct, I can tell you from experience that most groups don't care AT ALL if you have the honorless debuff. They will actively gank you as soon as you land at a flightmaster or zone out of an instance. I've gotten my ass camped as I corpse-hopped into BRM and into DM, dying to the same group 10+ times.
---
Nobody I've met so far cares even a little bit.
---
This "helpful tip" is *complete* trash.
---
I've gone from 100%-&gt;0% and stayed mounted (till death at least), so I'm not sure if that's the case.
---
I like this area, though you can get ganked every so often here. Inside the cave there is also a couple small thorium node points. Don't try to solo the caster mob at the end, he is unkillable unless you are on the quest, but a chest can spawn there as well.
---
Hah, it has the sex number and the weed number.
---
If we're fighting only one or two mobs at a time, don't really need to dance. *shrug*
---
Bloodrage, sunder armor, cleave, revenge, and taunt all work in defensive stance. I don't over-complicate things unless it's needed.
---
Stealth through DM:N and just afk on the ghost ogres behind the king.
---
Or you might have a bad/fatigued browser
---
Horde. Ez clap
---
In one Classic Dev-Video a Dev told that he designed that Quest. I did that on my Pally for the first time ever, because I thought I combine it with getting the MC Quests there.
---
Sounds really shit
---
So he should go play somewhere else because he likes how the game currently is and you should stay because you want to change it? What..
---
ARE YOU KIDDING I JUST HEARTHED OUT AAAARGHH
---
I've rolled an alt alliance druid on a PvP server heavily dominated by Horde, currently I'm at level 51.
---
I'm absolutely loving it, it was the PvP experience I was cheated out of when I initially leveled due to layers and a lack of honor.
---
And someone will whine about that whine.
---
I love killing pallies there are so many of em its hard to pass up the opportunity... just takes a bit longer esp. if they have bodyguards which is typical of the class. Cant do shit solo. Ret pallies are joke damage at my level range as well. You mad that you want to reroll or what?
---
This is wotlk im pretty sure. He's got the black war bear on his bar.
---
Does it equal the same amount of hit chance?
---
Looks like the druid only fp in moonglade.
---
I like them for a few reasons:  
---
1) Farming DM E you tend to get a lot of them naturally (the mobs that drop them tend to also drop Felcloth, Runecloth, and a decent amount of silver so they make good targets regardless) And being non-vendorable/soulbound you might as well use them
---
2) In the advent of more data being analyzed for raiding saving yourself a GCD from lifetapping during a fight seems small but can add up. Warlocks in Molten Core don't really do that much other than Shadowbolt (Corruption if the debuff limit isn't hit and/or Curse if you're assigned one, outside of the banish fights) so little edges are all you can really do to get better numbers in the more straightforward DPS fights such as Magmadar/Golemagg.
---
Yeah I understand not wanting to be solo
---
My guild has a few server firsts alrdy for pve. Hand of sulfuras and such. But they hardcore pvp too. They plan on being r14 and all that. I'm just a hard raider myself. But there is war at hillsbrad and most major cities every night. Endless in some zones like TM.

Our Goal: Provide a guild for people that have kids, work 50+ hours a week, and have other real life responsibilities that keep them from joining a hardcore guild. We aim to complete all end-game content whether it is PvP or PvE related, but at our own pace. Whatever your goals in classic, we would be delighted to help you achieve them.
---
Faction: Horde
---
Server: Earthfury
---
Raid times: Primary day is Saturday 9pm to 12am EST. Second day will be added after the first of the year based on raid team availability.

Ironic.
---
In my experience it came from Ultima Online where "ganking" meant "gang killing" where a group of hostile players would kill a single player(See: Phase 2 Death Squads). If you were killed by one person it was just "I got PKd" (player killed)
---
Now "gank" seems to just mean something killed you. Not sure when the trend started since I quit WoW in Cataclysm and haven't really touched MMOs otherwise
---
Raided retail before classic.
---
Haven’t logged into retail voluntarily since late August. 
---
Am loving my PvE server as well.
---
Silithus has quite a few "points of interest"
---
can I have your stuff
---
I'm skeptical because Blizzard broke the census addons before, and I have yet to see anything that shows the current census sites to be even close to accurate.
---
Cleave shouldn't be used when tanking unless you have rage to burn.  I doubt you have rage to burn, because I don't even with 4-5 man pulls... but somehow I feel like you're going to tell me you do.
---
Don't undersell them! They also port groups back to Ironforge.
---
Alliance warrior gets freedom and sword spec. Fuck horde.
---
Since DM has been out.  Haven't seen a class book drop from a dusty tome.  
---
Seen alot of books drop off the last bosses. Forors  last night finally.
---
What adding is he using on his equipment?
---
I'm seriously considering trying to get Star of Mystaria for the 1% spell hit for my taunts. A resisted taunt never ends well.
---
If you want you can come roll a horde toon on my server where there's a couple ally guilds that have planned raid nights where they camp every horde player in a zone, camp the GY, and do this for hours on end. Or you can suck it up because you rolled on a pvp server and both sides are dicks to each other, so give as good as you get.
---
I was about to hit MC and Ony but decided to cancel my sub. I simply do not have the luxury of time to play for 3 hours waiting for my party to die their way to a dungeon. It saddens me that this happens but I have better things to do. I tried leveling an alt but it's almost impossible ATM.
---
I don't expect to be killed for honor, and I don't kill the other faction for honor either. 
---
I rolled on a PvP server for the PvP.
---
Maybe Classic is just a boring mess.
---
In every damn zone.
---
Might want to steer clear of non shadow priests as a paladin.  Your damage isn't bursty enough to kill us when we have mana and we will kill you when you either use it all or we burn you dry.
---
Or put in on the instigators.
---
"Honorless Dog - decreases honor gained from world PvP kills by 50% for 30 minutes"
---
Is it even worth boosting alliance in RFC though?
---
I assumed it was just Unbreakable linked because of the stolen thumbnail, but no, this is actually a 2019 montage with fucking Linkin Park playing. What the hell dude.
---
They only care about your freedom and buffs, let's be real.
---
Do you play on a phone dial? Nice!
---
Eyuuuup. Thats PvP.
---
Just scroll through the top 4ish posts to see if any news has hit then move on with your life. That’s not just this subreddit but any gaming subreddit. Trust me, you will be a much more happy person.
---
NEVER.
---
Make a salt dump megathread and take down the excessive amount of salt dump posts.
---
haha I'm just holding out for naxx set bonus
---
You’ll never have to go back, so don’t worry too much.
---
Azshara is the best spot for me but it comes with PvP.  
---
Off the beach for the schools of fish and trunks. The fish go to my alchemy alt. The trunks have stuff for the AH.  
---
I also have 300 mining and herb so I can keep an eye out for those as well as I go to and from the beach.  
---
Yesterday while fishing in a random spot I opened a clam with a Golden Pearl so there's a bonus 35g to help pad those numbers ;-)
---
*Laughs with 2k+ multi class status.* 
---
Pick a class fam: Rogue, Paladin, Mage, Priest, Warlock, Warrior. Got em all. 
---
Giant post and childish troll attempts just prove you’re a PvE carebear crying to reddit.
---
I always thought the #nochanges crowd was a bunch of mouthbreathers. They're the ones that insist on going through the same Vanilla phases as if this was 2005.
---
Blizzard needs to step in and make some changes in the spirit of 2005. That means that if something would have been unacceptable back then, Blizzard should intervene.
---
Possible changes:
---
* Faction queues : Servers are limited to 60% of max capacity for each faction. Free transfers are available for anyone stuck in such a queue.
---
* More &amp; stronger guards around flightpaths, boats, zeppelins and towns.
---
* Kill the Spy addon. Disable /who if you have to.
---
* Reduce World PvP honor gains to 100%/50%/0% rather than 100%/75%/50%/25%/0%.
---
* Reduce World PvP honor gains by 33% per level disparity : A 60 would gain 67% of normal honor for killing a 59, 33% for killing a 58 and 0% for 57 and under.
---
* Add an elite patrol in BRM that kills anyone in his path similar to Stitches. It won't stop raids, but it will force them to move around a bit to avoid the patrol.
---
Hell yeah grats man! I just refuse to pay 1.5k gold for it and I’m deep in my forors farm so I suppose I’ll just keep at it. 
---
I do have to say I’ve been fortunate with the wrong damn books and have been able to afford my epic mount. But yeah, Forors would be nice soon.
---
Agility enchant is phase 3 isn't it?
---
You shouldn't be able to see any of that, mages actually have a skill which allows them to see buffs.
---
Ashenvale, redridge, wetlands, duskwood. Off the top of my head those are where you’d likely get some action ~15-25 lvl.
---
So edgy...... oh and so stupid. Once you offend all your friends you have nobody left to play with. My guess that is why you hide your bad behavior and lets be honest existence in a game and take out your pain on others. It will not matter you will still be you and that is pathetic. There is one way off this ride, take it for all of please take it.
---
&gt;we haven't been desperate enough to bring along a boomkin
---
Boomkin is top caster DPS in current content, lol. The fights are too short for their mana problems to kick in. AND they provide a spellcrit aura for their too. So, by not bringing at least one boomkin to the party, you're hampering yourself because of "boomkin bad" meme.
---
Looks like a millennium to me
---
&gt; penultimate 
---
that word means "second to last"
---
I rolled a PvP server because I like how the conflicts never feel "contrived" like they do on PvE servers. The situation we have no though is nothing like how it was back in the day sadly. The PvP is almost always mass gank groups or people camping dungeons and flight paths.
---
yeah, I recomend the DM:N method. Just do a normal/tribute run and stick around after the group is done. Bring 10 stacks of arrows and go to town on the spirits after the run is finished.
---
That may be the case. Or they will wait 20 seconds until you are profitable to kill again. Either way, no harm either way.
---
Mate, seems you may not have seen Apes clearing Nx40 in 1hr20 after it was just released in full AQ/BwL gear.
---
Check out monkeynews' YouTube channel, good watchin'
---
Well then screw em. Raise the saber *rattle rattle* I am really hoping it does settle down after the next update so I can at least catch up. It is trying at times trying to get to the areas you need to. SM is near impossible.
---
Should i get the talent that increases the hp healed then?
---
Not necessarily, the thesis still works if people with working, adult brains are merely outnumbered by mouthbreathers who click based on immediate emotional reactions.
---
every group of random players is different -- sometimes polar opposites.  
---
I think you found the secret to human life
---
Yes you can be ported at 55.
---
I liked the unspoken significance of:
---
    [Delusional]: LFM WORLD PVP
---
It works great for most aura but i'm having a hard time with Sivine shield (because there is no aura in classic) , Any tip ? (i would like the remaining  time on the buff)
---
I believe its plus healing. Should be
---
That... is one cool Guild Name
---
same thing happened to me
---
Lunar festival, and the offchance you do scarab lord quest chain (or help someone with it).
---
Level 19 horde twinks gank in Red Ridge Mountains mostly, Ashenvale would be the 2nd best option.
---
It’s not tho is it. Its pointless.
---
What case and point? I’m agreeing with you dude! Really appreciated the helpful advice!
---
They made their bed now they gotta sleep it in it. My point was they chose the wrong server type.
---
Solo quested/leveled on my priest just fine. Have yet to level shaman but id reckon they are more effective solo than pally.
---
Wait what happens December 10th?
---
no one said they're insanely rare, just that they're good and there's only a chance at any of them dropping once per week and then you compete with everyone for them
---
with a 20% drop rate, your guild may get one every five raids, that's only 10 in a year and that would actually be one of the better drop rates, and that assumes you don't miss raids when they drop
---
I don't know 100% but I know you sometimes get BGs with no healers which has always led me to believe it's random.
---
No /s. Totally agreeing with you dude. I’m working on that attitude thing as we speak. It’s fuking working man!!!
---
If you’re leveling in Affliction and need 2 more points to spend, sure. It’s helpful.
---
The drop rate is AtlasLootClassic
---
sounds like shit. what we do when we pug is MS&gt;OS and you can only win one loot per boss. other than that i believe our other group uses DKP
---
Now it sort of means you were killed by something in an unfair way (or seemingly unfair) which, to be honest, is still in the spirit of the original meaning.
---
These are the children that will kill classic.
---
It's not as good as some other options in the ring slot (dragonslayer ring from ony head comes to mind) but it's not bad. It's not nearly as good as ToEP
---
Agreed. 95% of locks are fine, but every once in a while you get an idiot. Life tap to your heart's content. My renew should be more than enough in most cases. I promise I'm paying attention to your mana bar, just also pay attention to mine please.
---
People keep saying this and it's pure bullshit.  Boomkin are literally bottom of the barrel DPS.  They're even below elemental shamans and shadow priests.  
---
You can confirm this by looking at warcraftlogs.  e.g. Max DPS boomkin parse on Rag is 448.  Max Mage is 742.  Max Warlock is 827.  
---
There is no fight where Boomkin are "top caster dps."
---
Ive had a bunch of empty ones aswell, i got every class book and a forors out of books though.
---
So original and fulfilling. You can do that all day, but he's more worthwhile than you are. And I highly doubt he cares what you think.
---
sounds like you're one of the douches that camps level 30s on an 80% horde dominant server. Dude, how stupid/selfish can you be? People rolled pvp because they thought it was going to be the same experience as vanilla pvp. Which it is NOT. Being outnumbered 3000 to 2000 in vanilla is NOTHING like being outnumbered 15000 to 10000 in classic, which is what is happening. It makes the game IMPOSSIBLE to play. And the more people who think like you, the more people will quit because they are sick of being dead for \~90% of their time playing. Phase 2 world pvp has already caused a LARGE percentage of players to quit, mostly alliance. If you want the game to survive, blizz needs to do something to fix this. Otherwise you'll be soon be playing a game where PVP doesn't exist because all alliance have quit.
---
it's not viable to do that because the honor from objective scores like AV bunkers or WSG flap captures outpaces graveyard farming
---
Where were you killing them?  I always see spawns up in searing gorge
---
We have the statistics. Boomkins are by far the lowest dps.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000/
---
You don't see the irony in the fact you are playing a twink?
---
You want higher levels to leave, so you can feel good about beating people when you have better gear...
---
Essence of Water is incredibly profitable if no one else is farming.
---
It has a larger effect on +3 mobs.
---
These are the children that will kill classic
---
That's the spirit!
---
Hmm it said no translation available when I tried it
---
Nice one man! I really like your vids on YouTube. Thanks for the quick tutorial on WeakAuras!
---
They’re turning pvp off
---
Yep reddit has taken a huge nosedive. Bunch of whiney leftists in every sub
---
Well, what's special about that quest is that you can get that axe 10 levels before the "appropriate" level to get it and it's OP for basically all of those levels until 40.
---
At around 40 to 59 there's generally one guy aoeing at the start of a pack and another one doing heavy single target damage. 
---
Taunt or not, the tank can literally not output enough threat to keep them all focused. Some say "it's fine, were not whiping" but its stressfull as hell to constantly be searching for which dps is currently being slaughtered.
---
More dumb and dummer memes
---
&gt;I think Blizzard was trying to not have 50+ servers per region at launch for people to choose from, hence why Layering was so important for them
---
Yes, of course, they have addressed it even before launch since they don't want to have dead servers and even with their (low) servers amount they had at launch they still have servers with quite low pop already. 
---
Merging is always harder than layers removal. 
---
Still, most of the servers I check have concurrent online of 3-4k. Servers which still have more were a target of several warnings to transfer from them.
---
2H Fury will do way more dps than a Ret Pala with Nightfall.
---
I love beating people up with better gear, but my gear doesnt protect me from level 60s? The difference is minimal when against players 20+ levels above you. Still helpless.
---
Great assumption there, just because I don't agree with you means I didn't play back then, rofl...   
---
So tell me, guy on reddit, since you're so knowledgeable on the original Dev's intentions for pvp servers. Mind telling me or pointing me in a direction where I can find one of these devs saying that this isn't intended? 
---
No? 
---
Oh.... it's just your opinion on how the game was designed and intended? Gotcha.
---
No, the miss rate on +2 mobs is 6% base.
---
Definitely not. From what google tells me, despite the level difference, both deadmines and ragefire chasm have a level requirement of 10 anyway.
---
delete the low effort memes
---
Perception and Shadowmeld are more niche than WotF for sure. But stealth vs. stealth is a huge part of organized PvP. Stealthies don't go on the front lines and fight stuff in fear range, they sneak around back and pick off healers. Being able to see other stealthies is a huge advantage.
---
[You can me baby ain't nuthin but mammals, so let's do it like they do it on Discovery Channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xat1GVnl8-k)
---
Doesn’t mean you don’t gain on anything other than +3 mobs.
---
Man, I hope you're right.
---
hordes are cunts
---
I'm a tank. So yes, I can imagine myself getting whispered all the fucking time. And for me they are asking for an hour of my time. So nice try but big fat fail.
---
Sounds like you’re better suited for retail
---
No duh?  This is on all the class discords for the classes with spell and healing power.  Frostadamus doesn't sound like a native english speaker, so he may not be familiar that everything is not literal in english games.  
---
For example, there are talents for some classes that reduce a chance to resist a spell, some increase chance to hit with spells.  There are some talents that increase chance to hit with melee weapons, and other chances to hit with melee attacks.  But they all do the same thing, bring you closer to the hit cap for raid bosses at either 6%, 9%, or 16% depending on what you are playing.

---
This, this exactly. Except my lock never leaves org without atleast 3 stacks of mage food/water on him also. But I also like to dungeon grind and like to be self-sufficient.
---
&gt;Absolutely unacceptable.
---
lol bro chill
---
wrong
---
BTW your argument "instead of doing something about it" is completely stupid. On my server it is 65% horde. We've tried to band together to form raids to fight and defend our other players but it does NOTHING. The second we bring any significant force to a zone to defend, all the horde in that zone tell the rest of the horde and then hundreds of new horde come in and wipe us all out. There is no way to defend at all when our numbers are HALF that of the horde. And our numbers are going DOWN, not UP because of assholes like you.
---
My server had weekly city raids and PvP in every zone without the honor system. The only thing it didn't have was people camping flight paths 24/7. Flight path campers will be in battlegrounds come the 10th, everyone else will be back to normal.
---
Ouch.. I’m on mankrik and the average prices varies between 900-1500g which I feel like is insane.
---
If the fight doesnt require a tank swap lol.
---
what server you on? 
---
maybe we can get you a nice helper man 
---
if you're horde on herod I'll be more than happy to hop in voice chat and get you some tips to help
---
Gotcha, I’ll just keep trucking along at it I suppose
---
I think they hit the nail on the had here. Not sure whats with the stigma of rolling while being dampened and winning being a bad thing. 
---
Might as well say you can only win one piece with that mindset.
---
&gt; the world was originally built for 5k max pop (estimation). now you have double and triple that causing a more cramped pvp environment. Example, in vanilla rarely would you have 70 people camping BRM. im not saying that there wasn't people camping BRM, of course there was, but no where near the numbers there are now. 
---
and because of access to mats. you have mats spawning (fixed number of locations and spawn rates) in the open world that was designed for 5k max pop
---
Rogue on our server kills people as soon as they land... he knows they’re not worth honor, but also knows he can get them again when they revive at half health
---
Well, we have a vent flair already, all is left is bot with "go back to retail" autoreply /s
---
This is exactly what I think would happen
---
Exactly... I remember a couple groups of 5 to 10 players roaming on the whole realm, but not 5 or more groups per zone ganking anything that moves
---
Live your dream there is so many ways to play the game
---
I can’t imagine so, but hell! Would love to see the general drek’thar and storm pike standing side by side being like “this fight is supposed to be about US!”
---
&gt;before the honor system rolled out and the chat issues only started afterwards. 
---
Servers were "layered" before the honor system rolled out.
---
Should i sell mountain silversage or will it ever go up in price in another phase?
---
They have this, it is called a PVE server.
---
My favorite motto: ya pull it, ya tank it
---
I had this exact discussion with my BIL who rolled Horde. He says I need to man up and L2P because he's not camping anyone. If I spend 2 hours in Felwood, I probably only die 2-3 times to a few different groups. But there are 5-6 of those groups. Each death is easily a 5 minute run + 1 min to get up and running. That's easily 60-100 minutes not playing for every 120 minutes.
---
&gt; sounds like you're one of the douches that camps level 30s on an 80% horde dominant server
---
Nope, I play Alliance and stick to 50-60 zones. I like the challenge. 
---
It's interesting you make that claim though, it's a way of trying to invalidate my argument without any facts or anything, just a way of saying that I'm a bad player or whatever. 
---
&gt;Dude, how stupid/selfish can you be? People rolled pvp because they thought it was going to be the same experience as vanilla pvp. Which it is NOT.
---
How stupid can you be thinking Classic would be the same as Vanilla?
---
As soon as I saw the phased content (That players knew about in advance), server numbers and layering I knew it wouldn't be the same experience we had in Vanilla, and anyone with half a brain could see that too. 
---
&gt;Being outnumbered 3000 to 2000 in vanilla is NOTHING like being outnumbered 15000 to 10000 in classic, which is what is happening. It makes the game IMPOSSIBLE to play
---
You want impossible to play? Try servers shitting out on you every time more than 100~ players were near Tarren Mill/Southshore. That's the vanilla experience.  
---
Everyone loves nostalgia goggles but conveniently forgets that servers (and internet) were so shit back then that lag and crashes were incredibly common wherever large scale PvP was. Right now you can actually play the game, but you just don't like that 'playing' is corpse running to BRM. 
---
&gt;And the more people who think like you, the more people will quit because they are sick of being dead for ~90% of their time playing. 
---
I have no qualms with PvE'rs leaving for PvE servers. This is where they should have rolled to begin with, not under some misguided assumption of PvP servers where everything is fair and equal, that was never the case.
---
&gt;Phase 2 world pvp has already caused a LARGE percentage of players to quit, mostly alliance. If you want the game to survive, blizz needs to do something to fix this. 
---
You mean like Battlegrounds coming into play in about 7 days?
---
&gt;Otherwise you'll be soon be playing a game where PVP doesn't exist because all alliance have quit.
---
No. Just the PvE Alliance players will quit, and I have no issues with that.
---
Keep an eye on your hit% that you're getting from gear as your start accumulating your preraid BiS and MC gear.
---
0/30/21 is a great raid spec if you need the points in Nature's guidance to get you hit cap. However, once you can get to 9% hit with gear alone, I'd recommend going at least 18 into Elemental to grab Elemental Devastation for extra dps. This will help you in both pve and pvp.
---
You must be a zerg player who goes ling+bane+lisk every game. Terran and Protoss have fallen off hard over the years
---
I would be open to some changes if the community agrees on what our goals are. The spirit of wow needs to be unleashed - the sever unbalance issue needs to be addressed. What is the goal of  the 'honor' system...
---
A good way to have your thread die with zero upvotes is by insulting someone who doesn't agree with you, the guy was being civil and just telling you his opinion and you all of a sudden go off on him
---
Cmmonnnn maaannnn
---
Sure.  but I still say it's less time efficient than just being in an SM group doing GY and lib until like 35 or so then getting the axe from herrod.
---
Sure it'll make your solo questing faster if you get it at thirty but I highly doubt it will be enough faster to justify the time spent doing the quest.  and if you get it later then it just gets replaced too soon to have been worth it.
---
Just keep consumes and mats in the mailbox.
---
"Every single person in classic is an active metagamer".
---
I made a macro that puts in party chat something like "please all need on blue/purp BoE drops to avoid potential ninja" and then just hit it before the first pull so everyone is on the same page. It's worked out really well, a few times even after someone won the item it was traded to a person who needed/equipped it then. Most blue items aren't really worth much since they won't sell on AH unless they are twink items and then basically everyone wants it because  who doesn't want gold
---
i think raid content is so easy now that only like 1% of people who raid actually flask up. the truth is that everything flops over with or without consumables
---
considering wow is an american game and the art is done by a Romanian guy, you bringing up irrelevant things shows you are either a troll or a huge weeb yourself
---
Theres a spawn in AV I think. I have a phasy memory telling me guildies back in 06 would join AV and wait around if it was a fresh one. The mage with his "BIS" gear (carrot on a stick and mithril spurs) would blink and secure the lotus most games. Now I dont know what patch this was on, and whether itll be In the game. Buy maybe it is?
---
Lifetap takes more GCD's to gain the same amount of mana. Tryhard warlocks will almost always use a rune and a major mana on every boss until your guild can kill them in sub minute times.
---
What do you mean Divine Shield doesn't have an aura? If you plug it into that WA it should show the icon and timer when your target has Divine Shield active.
---
If it's not picking it up based on name you could try switching to SpellID: 642 and 1020
---
You certainly can. My brother and I did Cath at 36, he was tanking and I was healing. 
---
With that said, the rest of the group was level 40 and it was guildies.
---
Now, I'm not saying a PuG could do this - or should for that matter - but it is possible.
---
\^Someone who doesn't understand the difference between PvE dps rankings and PvP viability.
---
Further to /u/aspbergerinparadise point - people are typically happy to reset once or twice for you.
---
Nobody likes the guy who uses them as a reset bot every other night. If someone asks me to invite their alt for them on the other hand, I know they're set for the night.
---
ahhhhhhh you are astroturfer shill. who pay you? russia or china?

IIRC you can enter RFC at 8.
---
This is a stupid argument. Him complaining once about people complaining for weeks / months are 2 entirely different things, is it better to stay quiet and let this shitshow continue? How do you fgure this is a logical response?
---
Awesome, thank you! I will be doing this once I get home from work. I appreciate the tip!
---
And the shaft

And when you pull this more than 2 times they start sheeping you for 30 seconds and we'll see whos wasting whos time.
---
I enjoyed the quest back in vanilla. I enjoyed the quest in classic. 
---
It's one of the "do something besides" quests. There's a lot of running and flying involved and not a lot of active gameplay. 
---
Sometime I do enjoy those quests. They're not great xp/hour, but who cares?
---
There's nothing sexual about what he posted above, and there's nothing sexual about what he's been posting here for months. I think you protest too much.
---
Old Blanchy is legit.  If you're alliance, message me and I'll run some instances with you.
---
Yeah but if you have twice the amount of horde players, then you would have to skip an entire battleground before queueing up (asuming it's 20 minutes on average assuming people try to rank up). That's not reasonably fast at all.
---
i think that as classic goes on people will use less and less consumables as they realize that its just extra work to get them and all raid content flops over easily enough
---
100% honor for killing an enemy the first time.  75% honor for killing an enemy the second time. 50% honor for killing an enemy the third time. 25% honor for killing an enemy the fourth time.  No honor gained if you kill an enemy past that, so no it won't be constant honor, because after one or two gy kills the people are going to stop ressing and just wait for you to cap the final flag or kill the leader.
---
You can't summon inside an instance I thought?
---
I think part of the problem stems also from people misunderstanding how hard it is to get to R10 or R13. A lot of players are participating in this bloodbath thinking they are eventually going to get the sweet gear.
---
Here are the 3rd week (tomorrow's minimum rank) breakpoints to reach a certain rank at your current rate :
---
* R5 tomorrow, you can get R8 in 4 to 7 weeks.
---
* R6 tomorrow, you can get R10 in 5 to 9 weeks.
---
* R7 tomorrow, you can get R13 in 10 weeks.
---
So anyone who's still under R5 tomorrow is basically out of the race. You're not farming honor enough to ever reach interesting gear.
---
Some servers (like mine, Skeram) filled up day 1, and having gotten into the game the moment it launched with a friend, we stayed.
---
We specifically moved per Blizzard's request, and still ended up on a server that was rough.
---
We could have moved again, but we already made progress. Now, even though transfers are up for my faction from Skeram, there's a lot to lose if we transfer, and it is a tough decision.
---
Change one of the macros in the healbot configuration to target.
---
See I think there's a bit of a difference due to sheer numbers. In a dungeon it's reasonably possible that you WON'T actually fill every single utility available unless not doubling up on any classes, and even then I feel it's likely you'll be missing SOMETHING. In dungeons I feel hybrid classes really get an opportunity to shine for their flexibility, especially if something goes wrong. Within a raid, if you're running 40 people you're much more likely to genuinely have wide utility available, including most if not all professions being on SOMEONE. In this case hybrids can just end up as a "worse" tank, DPS, or healer compared to classes more focused on one or two role niches. Hybrids are often brought, but most often as their "best" variant, which often comes down to being pigeonholed into healing since there are far more classes that can just DPS and possibly do so easier or stronger.
---
Its amazing how many people throw this stupid argument of "lol you complain about complainers", does it sound like a logical argument in your head? You dont see the difference between him complaining once vs weeks and upon weeks of complaining? Is this rocket science for you?
---
No they are not. Why are you spreading this garbage? Did people do this shit befoer honor system? Hardly. No complains. You think people suddenly started ganking for no honor once the honor system came out?
---
Ony is the same. Ony's necklace is BiS until kel-thuzad, the ranged weapons are BiS until naxx.
---
A lot of the stuff is BiS, but also the more casual guilds will likely be able to stream pugs and they can get the gear the guild doesnt want. You'll only need 25 or so for MC so most people won't be stressed about it imo.
---
that was when there every realm had layering, what about now there isnt any anymore. if they had 3 + layers of 3k then ofc it would more more than 2006 but what about now theres no layers
---
How you know someone doesn’t read the post
---
Wouldn't worry about. Not every guild is trying to speed clear shit. Some people play the game to enjoy it and don't care if it takes an hour longer each raid night without the 100% fully optimized comp.

Are you serious? You mean i can go back to whitemane and lvl up my 51 hunter?? I left whitemane for pve server. Awesome
---
Nope, has to be the same ID.
---
Kinda wanna know what my guy said 😂
---
You can use a discombobulater ray to dismount people if you want.
---
You can set the hearthstone anywhere, though.
---
few options:  Kill water eles in felwood or EPL for essence of water.  Kill naga in azshara for  golden pearls. Kill things in winterspring for firewater/ekos. Go around mining or herbing.  Grab a group and farm epics/ekos from giants in winterspring. Kill things for elemental fires (multiple spots around).  Group up and farm eyes of shadow.  Find a group for dire maul east jump runs.  Sell runs through scarlet monestary or sfk or other low level dungeons.  Run strat, maybe even reserve an orb if you're tanking.  There's a few I have used
---
Most people weren't even 60 during this phase of wow.
---
For me the joy is the journey getting to 60. MC and Ony first clear felt amazing. But after clearing every week, it loses its appeal.
---
Sure PVP gear is God-like, but the grind is not enjoyable. Everyone thinks they'll get Rank 14...but they're not.
---
I'd rather spend my time on an alt. So far have a 45 warrior and 24 druid.
---
A nightfall shaman can just be another Warrior doing a ton more dps
---
Just rerolled on a pve server and loving it. Now I just tune in to watch the community tear itself apart.
---
Seemed to do a lot of damage to me with that moonfire and bear charge. Was only 54 at the time
---
plays a fantasy game:
---
"I want to be a human person"
---
I had no problems with that on pvp server. But I believe when cleaner comes there is no cooldown and you can try again (this is from wowhead comments).
---
But it seems in the classic patch the respawn timer is much faster. Like 10-20min or so.
---
Please unbind your back key D:
---
If it isn't pvp ganking it ie elitism. This stopped being an MMO. When too many people exist on the server it no longer is a multiplayer game and becomes a singleplayer game where every other player is just a dynamic NPC. 
---
YOU don't matter to other players, YOU are just a replaceable variable. When servers are smaller every single player is important. But when we have 3-5 times as many warriors and warlocks? Nah,just skip/kick him cause he made one mistake or took 3 seconds too long or because the guy we like is coming. 
---
Playing true vanilla on a medium population server you didnt struggle to get into groups because ANY group took ANY build because there was no min-maxing elitist bullshit becsuse you couldn't afford that mentality. 
---
But now, everyone can be replaced because there's 10-15k concurrent players on these servers.
---
My litmus test of how much of a complete smashing success Classic has been is seeing the exact same tired complaints 15 years later.
---
Carebears gonna carebear.
---
It's everything I could have ever imagined.
---
literally ANYTHING else than a whine thread, how bout that
---
The thing is, every group is different and is comfortable with different things. If healer or DPS expectations don't match up with the tank's behavior it's either "OMG you pull too slow" or else it's "OMG gimme a chnace to drink". Sometimes it's *both* from different members of the same group.
---
I haven't really met someone I consider good at pve that is bad at pvp or vice versa. Usually it's just people who are deluded into thinking they are good at one of them when in reality they are bad at both.
---
Now checkmark the "zoom" attribute on each bar with 0 padding and it actually looks good
---
Oh god, you just know someone has done this.
---
What quest swords are better than thrash that isn't mirahs song? Nothing parses nearly as well
---
It's better than the axe from Herod. For alliance it's bis for like, 12 levels? For horde it's bis for 14 I think.
---
Getting it at 30 for a warrior who's prepared and knows what to do it totally worth it.
---
Getting it at 30 for a warrior who isn't prepared and doesn't know what to do is not worth it from an efficiency perspective, but some people actually enjoy doing quests and read everything. For those people, it's a pretty cool quest.
---
There is a very useful google doc doing the calculations for your exact gear setup on the warlock class discord.  Head over there and do some searching around for it.
---
first of all, ravager isnt even remotely close to whirlwind axe unless maybe youre alliance and doing melee cleave runs (but even then im skeptical)
---
2ndly, getting ww axe at 30 is huge, an absolutely enormous boost in offensive power. its a weapon you wont replace until ulda sword (and thats a really rare drop), and you're using it at level 30
---
The only shitty meme is the ammount of whining
---
I like the idea, for example, yours would go under Whiney for sure.
---
Once you do the quest to get a soul bag just keep the bag full all the time, if it over flows delete them as needed from your other bags.
---
At 60 have a bigger bag, a 20 slot that you always try to keep full is fine. 
---
At 60 instead of deleting excess shards I bank them in a second soul bag, you don't NEED to do this but I like to turn up to raids with 40-50 shards. People will say you don't need that many because you don't need to summon and people can just walk which is true but i'm a warlock and If I can speed things up by summoning and help people out with healthstone that's what I'll do. With the banking excess shards it's not like I ever really need to farm anyway, in a dungeon/farming/during raids etc I'll just fill my bags and if i end up with excess they sit in my bank until raid night. Again you don't need to do this, you could rock up with just a full shard bag but I don't want to be telling people sorry i can't summon/healthstone you because I'm out of shards ever.
---
no Sash of whispered secrets has too much spell damage it overcomes the ~11 spell damage that 1% hit is worth.
---
A lot of people care, now gtfo
---
On horde side Xanzilla was reliably pugging BWL with 0 wipes on horde side on both LH and ND. 
---
Took 1/3 longer than the average guild needed, because he always took the time to explain the fights, but it was buttery smooth.
---
Can I ask what you are doing currently, aside from Rank 4 HT spam? You may have some tips I should try.
---
I know the cleaner comes if someone heals you or the dudes, didn’t know if it came down when you got attacked.
---
Didn’t know about the shortened timer though. That’s awesome!
---
They have nothing to counter fear outside of 5 minute trinket, so if you survive until your second fear they should never kill you.
---
Bear charge hurts though.
---
Depends on content. 1% hit is big vs raid bosses but almost useless vs under level mobs.
---
this is a weird question, and may be stupid but bear with me.
---
How much does end game gear really push the envelope to how strong you are compared to say pre-bis or the random junk you get while leveling even?
---
I really wanted to get into this game, but the thing that really keeps me from being in it is the fact that while leveling, nothing really seems to actually make me feel stronger. I am leveling a hunter, made it to around 35, but i can always just fight the same 3-4 enemies max at a time, or 1-2 comfortably.  Will i kill noticeably  faster at end game once my character really starts to come into its own? again, may be stupid but i've never really played WoW in general so it is hard for me to know, and this is super important for me
---
Correct, it doesn’t, but that’s the best you’re gonna do short of spell power. If you still can’t manage to hack it, then start speccing more into ret and pick up the extra damage from seals in holy. It helps to use a fast weapon to take advantage SoW procs since the mana back also increases threat, but again, that’s not a scaling source of threat.
---
If you haven't done Shimmering Flats yet, stop by there and do all the quests.  It's good for a level or two, and there's a lot of back-and-forth between there and Booty Bay.
---
I’m at 300 skinning and 270 tailoring and my Alt is at 270 LW. What should I be making and selling to maximise profit on the AH? I’m trying to save for my epic mount, so any profit is good profit
---
there's just too many people on each server
---
Wow, your attention to detail is awesome!
---
its actually not useless since a mod is LITERALLY asking advices in the comments, this on the other hand, since proven wrong, is entirely useless, Gz.
---
i liked grinding the blood elfs in azhara, they drop runecloth so its effecient, unlimited sustain. They have low hp pool and can  drop travelers backpacks.
---
OMG this is funniest shit iv seen all day LOL
---
Delete classic wow and unkill retail pls. I'm sick of you whiney fucks who destroyed the main game being discontent after you pretty much boomed the raiding scene on my server. I'd at least be able to accept and understand it if it sounded like any of you were having any semblance of fun.
---
Any particular reason that Gnome isn't dead? You're letting your Horde brethren down!
---
1.) AB isn't until the later phases where most of the serious premades will be done with
---
2.) BG Weekend heavily determines whichever BG people do that week
---
3.) No good premade would ever camp a grave yard because no one ressing = no honor during flag captures.
---
Ironically, Gehennas which is a 60-40 horde server doesn't feel that bad. Alliance is resisting the zergs with all their might over here, and I'm actually enjoying myself.
---
It doesn't. You are making the typical strawman, proclaiming that there is only one exact interpretation of "worldpvp" and "pvpserver". This is obviously and clearly wrong.
---
Wow has pve and pvp servers. 2 extremes. You don't get to decide where every part of the gradient rolls on.
---
Just because your party is right of the center, doesn't mean you are fascist.
---
It feels like every server is like this because of the sheer number of players. Even on the heavily 1 faction dominated servers there's enough players from the lower number faction to camp every zone pretty effectively.
---
It reads like every other post from the forums regardless of what year it is, lol.
---
Raiding gear makes a big difference over pre-BIS, you will notice.
---
I don't get that at all, first enchants I was getting I thought the enchanter could have mats for some few gold enchants. Like a bag in the bank to swap out quickly with some cheap reagents, guess not :(
---
Because it's easier to copy/paste then respond to each person who quips the same drivel:
---
&gt;  Which is fine for people just starting out. As it stands, I'm in a raiding guild with a great group of guys. I fucking HATE the server though. I only joined due to 1 friend, who ended up quitting after about level 30. What about people in my situation? I guarantee you there are thousands in my predicament.
---
&gt;  But thanks for that. I'd never heard of PvE servers. Not sure what I would've done without your response. It really added value to the overall conversation. Thank you.
---
Ambush on opener
---
Your second paragraph reminded me of work. Fuck.
---
I actually haven’t been playing classic WoW, but I believe you could cast hearthstone while invisible. So my guess is yes.
---
Start some threads, quit bitching.
---
“I used complaining to destroy the complaining”
---
Not on your own for the most part, you can only get 11 batches of exploration xp without leveling up so having a Warlock summon you to a location is the best bet. I heard of folks hanging in non-contested enemy zones too, especially when playing a healing class so that you can troll non-flagged players by healing any mobs that are aligned with your faction.
---
Its been nothing but memes. A couple months ago i posted a mathematical comparison of the dps benefits of two talents (one provides ap, one provides crit), and it got downvoted. This sub is toxic to anything that isnt cookie cutter meta trash.
---
Not sure about hunters, for warriors &amp; mages you definitely get much more powerful.  Warriors DPS skyrockets, mages can kill 20+ mobs in a row before needing a mana break.
---
You're right, fuck it, let's just replace everyone with warriors and priests cus warriors top dps anyway. Now tetris is less linear than wow
---
Heartbreaking if you're Jaelaw..
---
Soni is still really good, and he got this far with Earthshaker
---
Oh boy, I must have really given the wrong impression in this text &lt;.&lt; The whole point of this post was to clarify, once and for all, that the spell power coming from randomized proprieties of greens is no different than the standard 'up to' wording :)
---
So on your first post you were curious to know the ratio....and after being providing with just that go on to disregard it as fake news because it doesnt fit your personal experience.
---
Just make up your own ratio then..
---
Phase 2 was sobering for a \*lot\* of people. It's turning factions on some servers into ghost towns. At that point, the dominating faction may just as well have rolled on a PVE server. What's worse, as the race for ranks is fierce, being outnumbered by that margin makes you more rare, thus making you even more valuable of a target. The cycle feeds itself.
---
i mean, if im doing grey enchants for you, and im clearly enchanting for money, i shouldn’t just ‘be happy’ when its there because im getting no reward
---
meanwhile if i offer a fixed charge people will complain to me saying im being cheap bc im not doing it for free
---
To not have the dmg break as he was planning to insta rocket helm.
---
ret palys are actually great in pre mades
---
Yeah cause there are SO many axes orc's can get.. Wait, there is one, and its like a 5% chance drop rate..
---
&gt;why remove lightning shield?
---
that doesn't even make sense
---
pvping isn't going to decrease the amount of herbs being harvested, its just going to increase contention over who harvests it
---
its not going to affect AH supply
---
The war has come!
---
Your carebear tears sustain the pvp scene. Please cry moar. Make moar posts.
---
I'm so proud of you.
---
Dafuq is a fury prot leveling build
---
As someone else said, you do STV in 3 waves.
---
Usually somewhere around 32, 36, and 40.  Might be even some lvl 44 stuff.
---
Just the 6 deep wounds buffs
---
it also removes the risk of changing prices of mats
---
So naive
---
&gt; No dungeon should take longer than hour
---
BRD, anyone?
---
you need 2 people to do this or an alt and wait 2min
---
2 people way: some rando outside , you log out , they reset , you log in at start of new instance
---
1 person way: get you and an alt in the same group, log out , log on alt , 2min game will make alt leader , reset the instance
---
i only do this 4 times a hour , if something happens and the game thinks you have used up your instances for the hour it hearth's you without burning your hearthstone 
---
though i do this sometimes when i need to vendor and repair, you get the same instance load screen but load at your hearth, which should be somewhere near the instance
---
wait, crippling poison rank III?
---
You're saying no one wants rich thorium nodes?
---
Positive P2 faction interaction post! I knew it would happen eventually.
---
That would be true if all pvpers are herbalist. I herb all day and probably 90% of people who I pvp arnt trying to kill me for my herb. 
---
It’s harder to pick herbs in general during this time than in phase 1. You can not deny that.
---
To be fair, he did it for the lols
---
#Nochanges, sorry you don't like vanilla. Maybe you should lobby blizz to make the particular thing you like.
---
Really sounds like a PvE realm is more suited for you. For a lot of people PvP realms tends to be more about the faction war fantasy. Alliance scum vs the horde savages. You're coming at it from a competitive PvP game perspective where friendliness is encouraged between opponents, but that isn't the case for WoW.
---
Getting ganked, or camped, or even spit on is part of the game and has been since 2006. It's not meant to be taken personally.
---
Ya I figure to get to r14 you're easily looking at 8 to 12 hrs a day playing wow. I'm sure the real no lifers took time off work to grind honor, which is why zones are camped 24/7. I can't imagine what taking vacation time to getting yourself to rank 14 means for your mental health, but I'm sure it's not good.
---
Youcan summon inside an instance, except DM
---
yeah, except questing on a pvp server lmao
---
turns out most of the population forgot about that one
---
so great, now youre in the top 501 people!
---
You heard him folks, no fun here, no r14 shamans, move along
---
I just dinged level 60 and now I want to go raiding. I'm concerned though because as a mage, I'm still real squishy. I'm doing more runs at various places but what hp should I be shooting for so I won't die too quickly in a rain?
---
Retailers going back to retail, than fuck for that. The game isn't going to die. Pservers has consistently had more than 100K players spread across dozens of different pservers ever since retail vanilla was released. You're legit fucking cooked mate.
---
Cool story, why not lobby blizz for the easy mode vanilla style thing you want? Classic is supposed to be vanilla "Warts and all", I'm sorry you don't want that but that isn't my problem.
---
If you have 3 layers of 3k each and you remove the layers you have one 'layer' with 9k people.
---
Well you knew this would happen.
---
The same things were true of pservers and it still took about a month
---
Horde players doing Horde things. They have only goal in the game: make your game time a shitty day.
---
It sucks als for Horde, I haven’t logged in since a few weeks now because it’s so boring.
---
so? First kill sure doesn't give honor. You know what will? Next kill.
---
Did my soup just blink?
---
Mage alt was created today and I currently try and do jump runs but it’s not as profitable when people want to split the crystals haha! Thank you, I will try some of these spots!

The green 2% hit from BRD is where its at.

Honorless target should refresh if a negative spell or damage hits you before it runs out, if it doesn’t already
---
Agreed
---
Nice! I called one of my pets Kimi :)

Oh look it's the guy with third grade math skills who made the population thread and he's calling my argument stupid.  Serious question did you ever figure out the math people were trying to explain to you?  If not, do you have a learning disability?  Sorry if you do.
---
My friends told me PvE servers weren't the "true classic experience" they've all quit already.
---
This is true. AoE spells do not discriminate. "Let God sort 'em out", in other words.
---
Thanks man that's great information, appreciate it
---
Yeah I agree. Don't need to stockpile for BWL, you need to stockpile if you intend to Naxx.
---
I'd go bone slicing hatchet or even the hatchet that drops from DM. 
---
Annihilator is ideal but very expensive and will become the fury warriors responsibility later on anyway when MT focus becomes more threat and OT focus becomes Nightfall debuff.
---
That site is shit.
---
Last I looked, it said Skeram had more Ally than Horde and Stalagg had literally 0 alliance.
---
/r/lostredditors
---
I wasnt part of #nochanges, but it really would have worked fine, if they had not made the biggest change to begin with: server size. They shoved 10k people into a building whos maximum capacity size is 3k, and then even worse, removed the layering that was put in place to remedy it. I hated layered because its a stupid concept to begin with, but its way better than no layering with 10k players per server.
---
I've heard of AV matches lasting for days. Is there any truth to this?
---
I was thinking enhance shaman
---
The title is a clickbait joke btw
---
Get creative lol. Plan ahead with people to farm dungeons today, and go in the morning at some off route. Or go grind or do low pop places. But no, they go quest in searing gorge and complain they can't level.
---
Anyway if you aren't 60 by now you aren't the sharpest one, so you probably can't think of doing things like this.
---
tldr: wpvp is fine because you rolled on a pvp server
---
BGs are cross realm so queues won’t be long for either faction
---
That doesn't answer the question about design intent.
---
It’s not like this in retail is it?
---
Love your fish. Having a hard time sourcing your feet, however.
---
Perhaps, but I dont go into the hives full of 59 elite bugs, so...
---
Correct
---
To me still the best loot way is gdkp, even if you don’t get loot, you still get something from the raid.
---
&gt;s key'ing
---
Yep, that's a newb.
---
Robe of the void is just barely superior. 1 % crit is only worth about 10.5 spell damage. Making robe of the void 2 spell dmg equivalent better
---
People are not going to wait 20s, you would have crossed half the map in this time. They kill you so that you’ll give honor when respawning. The fact that you have the debuff is almost worse since they have to kill tou 6 times before ignoring you instead of 5
---
While leveling what really makes a difference is your level. Gear is nice but you can level all the way to 60 with only the quests/drops you get. 
---
This is especially true for hunter. If you are BM specced a roughly third of your damage comes from your pet which does not scale with gear at all. 
---
At 60 it’s a little different. Now you can’t gain levels to get stronger but all you can gain is stats. Yes an upgrade of 5agi does not make a huge difference but get a couple of upgrades and you’ll see bigger numbers and more crits etc. 
---
Only thing that makes a huge difference is your weapon. Aim to get the AV crossbow as soon as you can and you’ll be set until Rhok from Molten Core
---
How do those Thrall's Balls taste like? Green?
---
&gt;- pretty much all PvP servers are 65:35 horde, there are 5 times as many PvP servers as PvE
---
Made up fact.
---
&gt;- even on a 50:50 server you have more horde PvPing leading to queues for horde on pretty much all pservers that have existed
---
False, for instance, ND was heavily ally favored
---
Ely fresh / lightbringer had horde favor but ally dominated pvp
---
&gt;K3 had close to the A:H ratio that we have among all servers combined and their queues were 45mins in the end.
---
K3 was not fucking balanced LOL you are so fucking delusional
---
Seems like ur warriors and rogues are shiiiet then
---
Cheers I’ll look for it
---
lol. no. Many fan artists have patreon. Blizz ain't coming for that free positive publicity. They aren't
---
Yeah, and Buru the Gorger (the giant scarab that you have to kite to the exploding eggs until 20%) too. AQ20 has some interesting fight mechanics.
---
&gt; Group is LFM for work PVP in general chat
---
&gt; OP is doesn't join them and wonders why he died solo. 
---
kek
---
Hey, are you on Zandalari Tribe? I think I saw you today :)
---
&gt; Bwl will likely be feb/march, my guess at least, januart [sic] would be too early.
---
Blizzard has said "early 2020." It's extremely unlikely they'll wait til February, much less March.
---
What are you 12? This is irrelvant to me.
---
&gt;	Vanilla servers had FAR FAR FAR less players
---
The game was designed and balanced around a smaller playerbase. This answers the question, you’re intentionally dodging.
---
You don't see them,  but rogues and druids are there.
---
Yes! ^^
---
Oh, that's what I was missing, whoops!
---
At this point I'm thankful when Deathsquads let me finish and loot a mob before killing me.
---
Yeah he shoulda just not played the game.
---
Rolepay.. Furries vs Anime girls.. Right? Right??
---
Was a kid when I started playing so probably didn’t understand lol. Plus I’ve always been a pally
---
As a player on a PvE server, 90% of this sub is unrelatable. The memes are tight though.
---
You don’t need to write a dissertation for every point he makes. And yes, you’re one of the try-hands. I rolled PvE, and ya know what? It’s EXACTLY the experience I remember. It’s only on the PvP servers where this bitch mentality of griefing other players is “part of the experience” of Vanilla where shit has gone south.
---
And Classic is still Vanilla even if they don’t follow their release schedule *exactly* as it was back in 2004. Just because the release schedule is slightly different doesn’t mean we should expect it to be a completely different experience. Try again try-hard.
---
Right at the beginning of vanilla end game they did "suck" becuase they didn't have the huge armor boost from dire bear it was only the 150% boost, and so they had less mitigation than warriors, and even now with all the theorycraft and crowd pummler tricks they don't beat out dps warriors and sword rogues
---
Ok Karen
---
Sick video dude.
---
You’re just completely wrong, they kill people because they will respawn and give honour. Nobody is going to wait 20s, by this time you’re way to far. Of course course after 5 kills not much point killing you. For max/min honor gain it’s the more efficient
---
The issue is, every GenZ and young Millennials are trying hard to be somebody famous on the game by releasing their live streams. Do not need to be a good players to get followers on Twitch: you just need to harass the #1 WoW streamer (stream snipping him no stop) and release "content" only against this streamer. Other GenZ and young Millennials are mostly rolling Horde because the narrative "Horde has better racial stats make them better for PvP" which give them the insurrance they will side with the stronger faction on the server. They will post videos of their gankings in MH (killing mostly low lvl players) and brave about themself they are very good at PvP.
---
How did you guys have enough douses in the 2nd week? Man it took so much effort to get people to even start that chain. Delayed us for 2 extra weeks....
---
&gt; pointless statement
---
Pfft, I am cannon fodder, and I am right. If you were intended to be honorless after ressing, then it would have been that way without any logging shenanigans.
---
Some great advice, thanks both
---
&gt; theres no reason to question the ratios
---
Laughable.
---
I'll keep this in mind for when I hit 60, but rn I'm lvl 41.sorry, should have mentioned it above
---
&gt;Because instead of doing something about it, they just aimlessly run to BRM and walk into walls of Horde players.
---
The answer is always "get more friends and push back" but on wildly unbalanced servers, where do you think those friends are gonna come from? What's to say the   
---
opponents who have a much larger pool of people to pull from won't also just call more? It never ends well for the faction with significantly fewer resources. That is further compounded by how easy it is to suppress them from getting resources in the first place. "Just do something about it" is not sufficient. When the deck is that stacked, what do you do?
---
I literally introduced by saying that so either you are wrong too or we are both correct
---
What happened with Devilsaurs? Yesterday I was working on mining and found a Devilsaur walking around. I was shocked and told the zone where it was. Silence. I then killed it and told the zone where the body was. Had 1 guy whisper me “asshole” then instantly ignore me. Had some others in chat say it’s a trap and to not skin it. 
---
Few minutes later I found two more walking around. Guess nobody kills these anymore?
---
As an alliance player and the grief that is BRM at this point. I have zero issues taking out every alt I run into while farming mid level mats like mithril ore
---
I'll take my chances :P
---
I'm not saying anything offensive anyway.
---
It does already ... and I’d rather die quickly without this buff than spend sometimes up to 1 mn for it to run out
---
There is no issue with pre totems, any good rogue can deal with that easily, the no ghost wolf and nade are less defendable. Im not a shaman so i cant speqj on if lightning shield would break the helm.
---
Biggest issue imo is accepting a 100g duel and not even having the gold to pay up if he lost.....
---
blasted lands mobs
---
&gt;  that these people have the ability to correct the problem and don't want to.
---
enough......
---
My options are change to an equally lopsided server or re roll pvp.
---
Your telling me to delete a character because I didnt guess the right server? I want to pvp, I chose PVP, this isnt PVP....
---
If I could swap to a pve I would in a heartbeat but as it stand, im quitting after the 10th if it doesn't improve. Id rather spend the time re leveling and grind all the stuff ive already done on a new game.
---
It won't break the helm effect though.
---
this is fire
---
200 IQ counter orc racial
---
It's not I0.5% it's shown as 0.05% droprate.     
---
That's 2k runs average if you're the only one rolling on it (no idea how accurate the 0.05% are).
---
Cool ty
---
It was already kind of useless. It's really hard for a large sub to be anything more than an image board unless the mods are really good about it (love it or hate it, r/games accomplishes this).
---
You essentially have to ban memes, fanart, "my girlfriend made this", etc. from the main sub.
---
What’s the issue with pre-totem? It’s not like there is a huge cd and barely any mana was used. Am I missing something? 
---
Thing I don’t understand is removing lightning shield. Do dmg on hit abilities sometimes bug and break saps? That’s the only thing I could think of.
---
I legitimately don't know what you are on about. We agree.
---
I feel like when I was using a faster bow I'd have auto&gt;aimed&gt;instant auto and I'm not seeing that with the carapace spine. I'm trying to figure out if I'm doing something wrong.
---
First off, I don't have a 2nd raid group.
---
The things that lead to those issues down the line are due to poor management, it puts a lot of stress (more than anyone person needs) on the guild leader/ officers. 
---
I'd rather have our guild run as a guild instead of a corporation, I dislike the idea of having middle management officers in charge of raid teams that I'm not apart of just for the sake of making our guild larger.
---
Theres no advantage of having a bigger guild unless like I said you're sapping gold from players.
---
Please don't put an end game enchant on a leveling weapon.
---
Turns out no ideas are unique and everyone has the same idea
---
Enjoy being a godlike dungeon tank, but make sure to pick up your prebis heal shit if you have any intention of raiding.
---
&gt; ret paly
---
&gt; pocket paly
---
Pick one. And stop spelling pally wrong.
---
I don't think many DPS bother with (or even need to bother with) FR gear. Fire Res/Greater Fire Res potions really provide all you need since you can pop one before the fight and one during.
---
So you actually choose who gets your honour? I like this as I have had some really good 1 on 1s and would have happily given them honour for having defeated me. I would also like to deny a bunch of  griefing fucks their "honour". 
---
Unfortunately I don't think the majority of people are mature enough to embrace a subjective system like this. I think you need an objective measure but certainly a better one than we have atm. 
---
Also when do rogues get nerfed? The fact that they can just freely gank capitols is not only a pain in the ass, it breaks the immersion imo.
---
Pretoteming in duels is scummy as it doesn't really simulate a real fight, but if you are going to do that stuff then at least wolf form so they can't just immediatley be removed.
---
This is unsafe for work reddit content! LOL
---
So OP is saying OH won’t miss after MH with HS queued and you’re saying cancel right before MH swing so I’m a bit confused.
---
Absolutely. You are one of the best pvp classes the entire game. Additionally, you said "end game raid." While gear is good if you can at least get Arcanist and Netherwind pieces you will be competitive the entire game. Obviously if your server is hyper competitive it'll be worse, but aq40 will start destroying guilds and people will drop off in gear.
---
You can get bonebiter at 34/35 and it's pretty much a direct upgrade from the ww axe.
---
I main mage but also tank. No problems waiting, but when everyone's good to go, please just go (or communicate in some way). Waiting literal minutes for the tank to pull one mob or a single small group is not reasonable *every time*. Just mark and move, or I will get antsy and irritated.
---
It shouldn't take 45 minutes to not even be at the first Zig in Strat UD, almost wiping 'cause the healer was afk since we were waiting so long for the next pull.
---
Mana breaks, bio breaks, even some amount of standing around, whatever. But it seems like half the tanks (on my server, at least) are doing fantasy football trades on the side they take so damned long. They also have no idea how to tank (read: if you're constantly losing aggro to the DPS, who are *all* using spells and abilities from *several* tiers ago, because you refuse to use defensive stance, aren't prot specc'd, and are marking nothing? that's a *you* issue. also, unbind 's' if you're not going to look behind you, you absolute mongoloids).
---
Patch 1.4 was nothing like phase 2.
---
* Ragnaros world first happened AFTER patch 1.4.
---
* Most players were leveling or hadn't even started playing.
---
* The few 60s were running dungeons and doing raids most nights.
---
* Nearly nobody logged on to farm honor specifically.
---
* The few that did farm honor mostly did so in Southshore.
---
* Almost nobody had Epic mounts.
---
* Almost nobody had engineering.
---
Anyone insinuating that this mess is anything like Vanilla has no credibility.
---
Had this happened in Vanilla, the Honor system would have been changed drastically, if not obliterated.
---
Wonky specs I've tried as Warlock that differ from the SM/Ruin, DS/Ruin, SM/DS normal stuff:
---
**Fel Dom / Conflag** 0/17/34. This spec was quite fun with lots of +fire damage gear. You're a tankier nightflag spec minus the nightfall, with 15% more stamina and two HUGE 2.4k voidwalker shields since you have improved Voidwalker and Fel Domination/Master Summoner. This spec shines in PvP-- you're hard to kill and you can also light people up with immolate + deathcoil + shadowburn + conflag. It's also surprisingly not bad in 5-man content, since you can spec into improved imp AND improved firebolt, giving you a machine gun imp. Works REALLY well with mages in your group, since you throw up Curse of Elements and pump out those firebolts / immolates / searing pains. Just get a threat meter. CONS: no instant cast corruption. But corruption is for virgins and conflagrate from behind two shields is for chads.
---
**Siphon Life / DS** 21/21/9. Want to farm Dire Maul with no problems, but find SM/DS boring without improved shadowbolt and faster casting immolate/shadowbolt? This is the spec with all the tools you need for soloing bosses (siphon life/ fel stam DS), but you can also get extra shadowbolt damage and make your shadowbolts and immolates ALMOST as fast as normal. Optimal for lying to your raid leader when he asks if you're respecced for MC-- you can pretend you're ds/ruin.
---
Any other weird specs I'm missing?
---
False. Raid damage is a mechanic that becomes more important over time, and as such HP is still a very important stat.
---
Nobody is complaining against Horde players playing PvE servers. Do not try to divert it to something that is not true.
---
That thing is going to last +10 lvs, if I find it relatively cheap I will. I dont lack in gold.
---
Or join an adult guild? Not every guild is some poopsock tryhard nerdfest trying to bleeding-edge a 15 year old elf sim.
---
Better on a warrior... :p
---
Skeram could use more people.
---
Aight.
---
Herod
---
Just hit 60 on my first toon in wow ever. As a tank. I've been noticing that literally almost every dungeon unless I'm levels above it has been a pain for me to keep aggro. I am now realizing that it's not my fault. I'm tab sundering, I'm demoralizing, battle shouting. Constantly finding myself with zero rage and mobs everywhere. I'm just writing this to show my appreciate for this article. People need to lay off going crazy and aoe and let the tank do his job.
---
I think the issues is and always will be that people are not always thinking clearly, a lot of times through salt or other similar emotions. So what happens is people say things during that highly passionate moment and it all gets vented somewhere for me earlier it was my server discord and boy was I salty on my 20th camped death. 
---
What I am trying to say is that this sub and all aspects of the game are catering to the market and unfortunately the market is full of people who are over reacting to a situation. 
---
It happens so much that I have seen games get destroyed due to the player base wanting changes to be made due to issues that armrest frustrating them they find a solutions and all of a sudden it is implemented because of the bandwagon and bam it has a detrimental effect on the game.
---
I think the reason for this is that people don’t think about the consequences of anything a wow classic example being unbalanced servers and how due to the dominating factions just going balls deep into their domination of the server it’s makes things worse so it becomes a cycle of less people to PvP against the more deaths for those that remain, so more leave which means less people to kill which mean those remaining are killed more often.... you get the point in that the consequence of making the other faction suffer so much is it gets harder to find meaningful PvP. 
---
The community on here have shunned away  content creators for self promoting but as a result they now don’t get any content that is enjoyable or informative because of it. Sometimes it  is better to just let people be and do their thing and if other like it then the upvotes will help solve the issue. If complaints about phase two keep getting to the top it is because it is resonating with enough people to put it there but there should be a degree of control from the sub a whole to not just upvote stuff because they are saying what you want to hear and upvote good content instead.
---
Already leveled three 60's, so yep!
---
Yeah, I'll give you that. It does feel like blowing away money sometimes.
---
Oh I see what you mean. Good shit to know in case I ever make a sham. Maybe they were going by tournament rules lol
---
Is there a reason you are unable to fully type out words, capitalize, and use punctuation?
---
Wow nice!
---
On Skeram and it’s solid.
---
Sounds like you've just heard a bunch of "ret is a meme" and never played classic or pservers, palies in premades will stomp BGs. Its actually a pretty non controversial statement.
---
Okay so I may have ranted on a bit 😂
---
I'd be sympathetic, but this guy seems like a hyper toxic, tryhard, douche.
---
Are you horde on heartseeker? Horde on my server, skeram, have a darn near clear path to BRM with no resistance from ally because the disparity between the two factions is so high.
---
This is just false, ravager is better than whirlwind axe.
---
Those ones don't drop elemental fire. You need to be in Arathi or UnGoro.
---
Probably a fight that punishes melee
---
Never doubtes your math. It is correct, however the numbers demonstrated doesnt say anything.
---
Would you be very kind and tell me the names of the 10 pvp alliancw dominated servers.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I think you've just said the real reason your guild doesn't have two raid groups.
---
You don't trust anyone else to run it and you don't have the dedication to create an alt to run it yourself.
---
And as a result, anyone who doesn't get into raid group 1, misses out on being part of your guild for the week.
---
No wonder they then join the guilds whose PUGs they join instead.
---
Winters chill you mean?
---
Shaman isnt suboptimal. Lots of warlocks and rogues is suboptimal. Having multiple hunters and druids is suboptimal 
---
Enh shamans are just plain bad.
---
And I'm not telling you that you aren't allowed to play badly but somewhere somehow "nightfall shaman" became a meme and now people think they are a reasonable addition to a raid when they do significantly less of anything.
---
I’m on skeram. But I seem to always see alliance death squads but I see only little groups of horde here and there
---
Most of the posts are complaining about horde in general.  It's a joke dude.
---
Pre totemming is kinda scummy but in the rogue case it just waste time as he doesn't wolf form so the rogue just take cares. Way to waste seconds of the duel.
---
I suppose the helmet thing with lightning shield make sense, I doubt it works that way tho.
---
Yeah I do this quest on every character, generally at high 40's or low 50's. Head to Azshara and do the level 46 quests which are green but quick/easy/good XP, head up north to nab the quests there while I grab the runes on the way (there's also an alliance quest to get an item from inside the ruins while you're there). Sure the run to hand it in is a little bit long but I'm not sure why anybody would get killed.. long as you avoid the camp of elite dragonkin it's fine.
---
It probably helps that I *always* level in Ashenvale because I absolutely love the zone, and make a point of ducking over to Azshara and nabbing the flight point while I'm there.
---
But yeah, no idea why the hate for Azshara. Wish there were a couple more quests but at the same time it's such a peaceful zone as almost nobody is ever there.
---
lmao except it was more like a couple of hours before honor was released, there were already groups of people gathering and fighting to get ready
---
That's not how the Honor system works. You're only being compared to your own faction on your own server. Queues could be 2 hours long it wouldn't matter. The people who play 18+ hours a day will still be ahead because they'll be winning every single BG while maximizing graveyard farming. In between queues, they'll still be roaming for kills in the World.
---
My concern with this approach is:
---
a) It is highly intrusive to the mechanics of the game to the point that combat itself is impacted whereas affecting xp rates is an indirect incentive, non-intrusive to player encounters while still encouraging a desirable result.
---
b) It actually may end up being a perverse incentive. Minority faction members are then incentivized to terrorize individual majority faction members with their superior combat abilities, further degrading the state of world PvP
