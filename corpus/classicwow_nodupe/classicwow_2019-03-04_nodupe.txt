Better question is what do you want from the prot tree, and how much will that help you?  Tactical Mastery from arms will probably help you more than anything.
---
Sleeping.
---
the parachute from the guy on the mountain in feralas is cute, sadly its unique.
---
That is A LOT of sleeping.... and how are you on reddit in your sleep?!
---
Gnomed
---
No, but there will be people who will make their characters for the fantasy aspect of it, and when they're max level, even when they've been playing for years, you're still going to judge them as noobs.
---
Well, if you're ever near Dallas you can come play local multiplayer games with me on my uncomfortable brick couch! 
---
Twinkle
---
Haha sure. There's quite a BIG bit of water in the way, and some rocks, but maybe one day I'll accidentally find myself nearby xD
---
Yes you can loot it and will get xp from it even if you did nothing. Hunters can actually level (slowly) by going afk in a spot with mobs with their pet on aggressive.
---
They also do some interviews on countdown to classic podcast. If you haven't check that one out, that'll kill a lot of time too. 
---
Yep. That me
---
TBH been playing games with mates, watching about 5 hours of YouTube a day and working out 5 hours a day
---
Had the same happen to me. I logged in on a trial about 5 years later to see my characters naked sat next to mailboxes. They'd sold all my MC, BWL and AQ sentimental gear. I was thinking about starting to play again but logging in to that was awful. The GMs couldn't do anything because I couldn't remember 90% of my items and it must have happened years ago. They said my account had been banned at one stage due to spamming gold selling websites in general and yell. I didn't resub.
---
Im living for this guy manually clicking his polymorph with his mouse. 
---
I will take a look, thanks!
---
Oto’s guide is better. But won’t be viable in Classic because they won’t be doing progressive itemization. 
---
Which games have you been playing?
---
No it isn't good for PvP. In PvP regardless of the enemy's level having +5 weapon skill will give you +0.2% crit chance and reduce your chance to be missed, parried, and dodged by the same amount. Pretty negligible, especially since your opponent will be stunned, casting, or not facing you most of the time, all situations where they can't parry or dodge.
---
I got chills watching that trailer
---
Not at all. People can play the game however they like, as I said "I  don't care if there are some guilds that clear MC and BWL and AQ within  hours of them being released." Not sure how you jumped to me thinking  that there is anything wrong with people playing how they want, or that  "my" way of playing is better (it does seem to be the mindset of online  discussion these days to just jump to conclusions and make assumptions  that have nothing to do with what was written).
---

---
All I am saying is that the people who have theorycrafted every  aspect of the game to choose a super-linear playstyle based on min/max  mathematics are going to have an issue if the reason they are playing is  to "recapture vanilla". If they are not playing for that reason, great.  If, however, as is espoused here pretty heavily (and in some cases by  these very people) they are looking for that "feeling" of vanilla, by  researching everything and planning their activities in advance, they  are actually eroding the chance of the game "feeling" like vanilla  because it just won't. As I said, they are potentially ruining the  chance of recapturing the spirit of vanilla. It might not even be  possible, even for someone like me who does none of this. Time will  tell, I guess, but I figure I have a better chance than those who are  deliberately removing the mist of time prior to playing.
---
  
---
I'm not saying they still can't feel that way, that classic won't be  able to give us those belly-tingles when we play, but the chance is  lessened if you are basically just doing a runthrough due to the vast  amount of research and planning you have done.   
---
 
---
And what is the reason for doing so much research and planning and  deciding which is the best race/class combo and where to level fastest  and which are the optimal talents to pick and how to max professions and  where to farm items and blah blah blah? Is it just to save time? Is it  because a great sense of satisfaction is gained out of maxing the  potential of a character? I honestly don't know. I am not a min/maxer, I  am not watching guides on which quest to do here and which class/race  combo is optimal for PvP or which class does the highest dps, so I don't  have the insight into what satisfaction that brings, or why people want  to do it. It just seems incompatible with recapturing the spirit of  vanilla.  
---
If you are one of these people, and not just someone who decided to be offended on behalf of others, then I'd love to know.
---
Hell, maybe I'm wrong and people don't even want to recapture the  spirit of vanilla, but I was under the impression that was kinda the  point.
---
Loot trading means I can roll on all the gear my friend needs in dungeons and give it to him, right?
---
Sharding means when people say "Hey come check out the 50 naked Night Elves dancing in Goldshire!" you run all the way there, and poof no one is there because it's sharded, right?
---
In my personal opinion.. people who downplay these things as a non-issue are not real Vanilla WoW lovers, or they are straight up stupid. Looking at you entire community downvoting this comment.
---
Fellow EU aerie peak here, although I don't know anything about this guy
---
the only people that wouldn't know about it is alliance players, doesn't really count :p
---
osrs. maxed with over 500m xp, all quests, 3b bank.. mostly working on completionist stuff while waiting for classic
---
Not Classic, it’s from Wrath, but I always found this to be the most hardcore wow pvp video. Really gets you pumped up. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4FFITWbUu3M
---
For the record, that's TBC.
---
So is there anything good about humans for pvp?
---
I’m confused, I was wanting the source for the OTHER shield. Not the one shown in the video. You said the one NOT shows in the video, had a different stat spread compared to vanilla and therefore why it isn’t bis.
---
Or I’m completely turned around.
---
Justified by what, exactly?
---
Haha, I’ve just lost interest in other games so I just pretty much go to work, sleep, and use reddit. 
---
No they were asked the question and instead of answering they changed the subject. 
---
Couldn’t agree more. Private server players are in such a rush it’s insane. And the most bizarre thing is the turnover rate like you said. One moment the guy is playing 12 hours a day and attending every raid, and the next day he decides to quit and doesn’t log on ever again. It’s mental. 
---
&gt; All I am saying is that the people who have
---
"All I'm saying is people who play the game in a way I don't like, are wrong and bad and not playing the game correctly"
---
Shoo, elitist.
---
Since Taurens have a longer melee range due to their hitbox, does that mean Tauren Hunters have a smaller deadzone?
---
Sorry but doing TBC with new zones and quests and not being able to level further seems pointless.
---
Same 
---
I played a huge amount of pvp as a 60 holy pally it was a lot of fun. They are very strong healers and can beat most classes other than casters. 
---
I also found it pretty easy to tank instances with a tank set. 
---
Okie doke, have a good one.
---
So you played WoW on hard mode.
---
I still think some people are going to be upset about how some of the things work out. Private servers get alot of the small things wrong (numbers, especially drop chances and even some of the battle stuff). They were all just guessing. Blizzard has the actual numbers for the most part.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
People really get Vanilla/Classic confused with private servers. That being said i am going to be happy with what we get, Classic is the play style that i enjoyed (danger when fighting even lower level mobs) and the slow progression to the end of the game. 
---
Deadmines!! 
---
It all started with 2 randomers who I met when bumping into them in West fall on my dwarf hunter. Ended up going deadmines when we saw on the chat for 3 DPS which was the perfect fit as I was with a human mage and a night elf warrior. Being a noob and it being my first run at a dungeon I was so hyped. 
---
After a fun + successful run I will never forget standing there looking at my spoils in my inventory (I had been lucky with grabbing a few greens) at the exit by the cliffs and felt so badass. I was ready to run all the way to stormwind and taking  and spending my earnings to the auction house. 
---
Well I felt badass until we were ambushed by a sneaky horde group who had just finished the dungeon and were hiding on the roof of the edit. The undead rogue had shot 2 arrows when we just left the instance but the mage didn’t bother tell us LMAO. Just stood there not reacting to the arrows hitting him!! 
---
We just looked up in horror and as if like something from a movie the whole of their group jumped down at the same time and took us by surprise. 
---
Wasn’t even mad we got wiped out - first dungeon and first encounter with the horde during pvp was cool as hell! 
---
Unless they start with a patch for it.  The luffa from Ungoro removes any bleed.  Any.  It worked up through original BC on Moroes when they patched it.
---
Playing the auction house while my sub is still running on retail to get more gold to buy game time when classic comes out.  I am also playing Black ops 4 trying to get my Dark Matter camo
---
When I take breaks from studying I work on my questing guide. Im just mapping out/organizing all the quests to max my troll rep so I can get as close to a raptor mount without spending too much on cloth turn ins. Also mapping out nice places to grind between quests. Other than that I watch joanas wr run. Mainly just durotar/xr so that I can get out of the rush area as quick and efficiently as I can.
---
Do you happen to know of any PvP videos with 25/26/0? The spec intrigues me.
---
It also became BoP in later patches, so once and done!  
---
Same with sleep dust from UD zone.  
---
This is a tough question to answer and would require someone with extensive experience with both factions.
---
I think it's pretty even but can't say with confidence.
---
Apex/working on my saltwater fish tank. Would be cool to try and be a streamer with a nice big salt water fishtank in the background for extra ambience. 
---
[removed]
---
Ah, hailing from the other side of the pond I see. Well enjoy your switch and good luck with the long and arduous wait for classic!
---
This is the correct answer
---
If you think that is bad. Check this out. This was on darkspear, where I played as well. Chipman was one of Swifty's friends and did the high-marshall grind with him.
---
https://youtu.be/zgbPO4lkmNo?t=549
---
Haven’t played online yet, but the main story in RDR2 is probably the most moving and exciting experience I’ve ever had in gaming. The single player alone makes it to me the best game I’ve ever played 
---
In a somewhat similar vein but slightly different, this video shows off what rogues were capable of in 1v1.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao7MYjMcHf0
---
Best pvp video
---
https://youtu.be/klm2Q7xu_d4
---
Stealth detection is huge in the Rogue v Rogue. Even putting that aside, weapon skills are great for PvE (which you will do sometimes), and Rep bonus is imo the best racial in the game. 
---
In NA everyone called Deadmines VC. 
---
It has everything you could want...
---
I upvoted bro
---
April 28th 2009 was my quit day. From what I hear, I missed out big with Ulduar and ICC, but getting married and doing medical internships took priority over WoW. Scratched the itch for a year on private servers over the last year and change, but man I cant wait for the real thing.
---
Vanilla wow. I was traveling thru the tunnel and a human rogue ganked me. Got ganked by the gnome while fighting the human! Killed both.
---
I waited for about 15min but neither of them respawned or came back.
---
Btw, this was before you could enable your character's name.
---
Sorry Crazychild! :)
---
Nope.  Apr 27, 2006 was the release date of the original video.  And it's pretty obvious by looking at the gear that it's not TBC.
---
What? No no no you dont beat with staff. You throw fire rocks with you wand
---
#no changes
---
But a toggle option for better graphics :p (not mandatory, just maybe nice)
---
Hah! I wasn't the only one that saw that thread and thought of wow.
---
iirc I only managed to do so back then with an amazing bit of software called PowerStrip, which allowed you to configure a way wider range of resolutions and refresh rates. also, you'll be needing a proper driver for your display, or you could try making one with PowerStrip.
---
Diablo mostly, pushing GR on Hardcore
---
I stand happily corrected!
---
Me not that kind of Orc!
---
Some of my plans:
---
Diablo 2: median xl, supreme single player mod that changes the whole game
---
Skyrim: requiem, similar to above makes it harder and more of an actual rpg where the world doesn’t level with you 
---
Dark souls, which I have never played
---
Final fantasy tactics, the original, I have only played the gameboy “advanced” version, apparently the original is awesome
---
Warcraft 3 and frozen throne on hard mode, to set up the World of Warcraft World!
---
I also have Zelda: ocarina of time master quest laying around, which I might play.
---
I think it’s a slippery slope and I’d bet we don’t see them in the near future. Blizzard wants to make expansions people want to play. Re-releasing all passed expansions is almost an admission of guilt that they can’t create new content as engaging as old content.
---
I think Vanilla is an exception though. 
---
Never really understood why people delete their chars when quitting WoW, like why remove that piece of history that you can go take a look at
---
Yea, I mentioned the punishing respec fee in a thread once and got downvoted hard. The no changes crew is not up for any compromise.
---
I played it effectively, i think, pre mc. The SorrowHill pvp videos were pretty popular
---
Because it’s the only way they could really quit. It’s actually not funny at all.
---
I don’t think MC difficulty should be buffed, but your argument doesn’t make sense. You think MC is easy and can never be hard, but you think all the other raids are already tuned to be hard. Why then couldn’t Blizz just crudely add damage and health on to MC bosses to make them harder? 
---
Again, I don’t think they should, but the idea that they can’t is strange.
---
That was fantastic 
---
I wouldnt understand why someone would hate a classic player that either plays far away on a private server, or stopped playing altogether over a decade ago and isnt bothering anyone either.
---
Thinking about it, making up and hating an invisible enemy you dont understand is what humans do religiously, so it makes sense i guess.
---
ATLAS and redoing L4D2 atm
---
A risk we’re willing to take
---
I think they are 25? yard radius from the totem location. So 50 diameter. Don't need to be in melee but close enough to hit them with the zone. There's a talent too to increase the radius to 30 yards in your Resto tree though. 
---
This should be top post.
---
The true impact of loot trading and sharding is going to be felt after launch, and people are going to look back and think, fuck. Why didn’t we get them to change this.
---
Well done. Fuckin chortled mate
---
10k online was pretty fuckin fun, not gonna lie
---
Do all of them. :) But yeah, when they announce servers we will have to pick one and decide all the details!
---
Making gold, it's the only thing I know.
---
Also private server :)
---
Well you won’t be when we start the guild. :) /u/mikeclav and I are already in!
---
Conald for a male gnome. Conan + Arnold.
---
Thanks for the idea! Question, though. Instead of just...... showing locations, what would you say to somehing that marked locations of chests you've found and maybe only tells you how many rare spawns are in a zone?
---
I ask because I want to develop add-ons that enrich the experience, instead of simply making it easier.
---
So what, it's like a quest tracker, but the goal could be custom? Find 8 bottles of wine or do 4 daily quests (not that there are dailies in vanilla, really, but for examples sake).
---
Do please 
---
I'm going to hold out on any add-ons that sound like they might get cooked into wow classic anyway (this would definitely be one of them). Thanks though!
---
How about zone-related muting? No timers, just simple "enter stormwind -&gt; mute music, leave stormwind - &gt; restore music"
---
Looking at guilds, 
---
NA
---
PvP
---
Horde
---
Raid times: maybe a couple days during the week, would prefer more Friday-evening/Saturday-afternoon or evening/Sunday-afternoon. 7 pm - 10:00/30 pm weekdays. Central US time. 
---
Semi-hardcore - 20 - 30 + hours a week playtimes. Raids/PvP
---
PM me here or comment!
---
I used to farm those candles on my rogue so I could farm chests from a heroic dungeon in TBC! It was one of the dungeons in Zangamarsh, you would stealth halfway through it, then there was a ledge you would throw a fireball down from to pull this whole pack that was guarding a chest. You let them run most of the way to you, then jump down, lockpick the chest, loot a couple hundred gold worth of crafting mats, then vanish and stealth out. 
---
Good times.
---
How have I played this game for 14 years without knowing this 
---
DM is dire maul and Deadmines is whatever you want because only illiterate children play alliance. 
---
That or there will be too many retail players saying "Everythings fiiiiine"  
---
I plan to copy my comment into every thread that has remotely anything to do with the issues. It words things in a way that not one could possibly argue against, feel free to spread the good word.
---
Yea, all the new zones are essentially wasted content if there’s no leveling. I suspect the idea is just to provide new raid content and 5-mans.
---
The only fear effects that can be dispelled are Warlock fears. Everything else has a red border and can not be dispelled.
---
Yes, that means that Psychic Scream and Intimidating Shout can not be dispelled. And no, most fears found in PvE can not be dispelled.
---
I probably should have mentioned I'd be going Hemo swords since I'd be on a pvp server and leveling with a warrior
---
Try 2 fpm during flight paths! Yes, that's "m", not "s". Tremble at the power of my 2000 model HP laptop with a docking station!
---
If you want a true representation of classic pvp, it’s whatever video is the longest, least interesting, most frustratingly grindy video that gives you almost nothing at the end.
---
If you want a funny video that represents the culture of classic pvp it’s the one where the Horde brings an entire raid to the Alliance in-game funeral a guild was having for their friend who died IRL.
---
I want to play in this guy's guild. Imagine the awesome raid snack/song breaks.
---
&gt; people are going to look back and think, fuck.
---
I.E many of the changes in retail. Which is why many people are anxious about every single change coming to Classic.
---
cLASSIC OVERTHINKING
---
I finally got my gf to start playing after a couple failed starts "This game is boring" "I dont know what to do." "I think I just dont like games..."  
---
Well let me tell you. Repeated daily exposure to Classis content has changed that. I also have that guy who made the album of game world pics to thank. I set it to rotate every 30 minutes on my screens, and half the time she says "ooh, that place looks pretty." Now she asks me to play with her nearly every night. Woot.
---
Ah I see.. When I saw people saying it's great for putting on tanks, I thought it meant only tanks got feared.. Thanks for clarifying 
---
Only two more to go!
---
Wow - did not know that. Thanks for pointing this out. 
---
I take it that WOTF can break all of these effects though, right? (both red border and non-red border)
---
Keep asking for TBC Classic when the modern game is the same thing. All it has is hardcore raiding and arena. That's what is funny. The vocal minority that pimps TBC is the same people that don't play the modern version.
---
Late wrath, you mean. Looking For Dungeon tool was patch 3.3
---
....he never said it was funny?
---
Its funny how the purist whimper the most. 
---
Yes. All sources of fear break work universally against all types of fear. Death Coil is an exception since it's technically a horror effect.
---
probably didn't use irc
---
This is quality content 
---
That's literally what it means, you dipshits.
---
If anyone suggests changes to support what their interpretation of vanilla WoW was then you guys reeeee, but if it's *your* interpretation then it's the *right* one. 
---
I fail to see what is supposedly wrong here. Something bad is being judged to be bad, that's what good judgement is about. You don't have to like it, just accept it. 
---
Hub.
---
Keep telling yourself that when the TBC private out there is better scripted than any other era of WoW. It's vanilla content is better than vanilla servers and it still can't keep a steady population of end game players. People level, remember TBC sucks and is an endless PVE grind and nothing more and quit.
---
Still does? Now you really must be joking. 
---
back in vanilla most of my casual friends ended up playing rogues, I don't know if it was just something from our social circle or not, but they all enjoyed it a lot would constantly tell me why rogues were the best lol
---
Tell me what server you roll on, IL happily farm candles for 1g a pop 
---
anal penetration 
---
Played on Uther, it was definitely called VC. DM was Dire Maul.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiO1eQoo9bQ
---
Yeah, it's definitely a different game.  I play with my brother and we enjoy just doing some casual things together.  We don't even raid heroic let alone mythic.
---
I do have to say that it's still entirely too easy to level/quest even without heirlooms.  Their is literally no danger in the world anymore :(
---
pls recruit me

If I'm not making a "24 hours post launch, level 32, just killed Stalvan" post, I'm a failure.

Take me back. :(
---
Hunter means using viper sting a lot and keeping yourself at range when you can. Personally I love it!
---
c&amp;d doesn't mean shit in these european countries 
---
Just beating all my single player games. Online games seem dull in comparison to WoW Classic. At least ones that require investment. I’m fine with Overwatch or BF2 or whatever until summer
---
Vanilla - WOTLK really were the best years of World of Warcraft. I know people give WOTLK a lot of flak for some of the features added to the game but it was still an amazing virtual world to be a part of and introduced us to some of the best zones, quests, dungeons, and raids in the game.
---
You reroll a character and join a MC guild I guess. But I suspect Blizzard will also create fresh servers as well. People love fresh starts, so there’s no reason not to manufacture them.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBrmGFcdJ50
---
I was going to say that casuals are what is missing, but you've put it much better.
---
Is there a reason to not put 1 point for pyro though?
---
3 level 60s and many low level alts later, I only have one feeling:
---
still incredibly excitedly waiting for Classic launch (provided it's not ruined by ActiBlizz)
---
Burnout is nowhere in sight.
---
Separate TBC servers with the option to *copy* characters over from classic, but character copying only becomes available after a couple weeks after launch, giving new players a chance to catch up. 1k cap on gold per transfer.
---
This is what I think they'll do because they can make an absolute boat load of $$$ from transfer costs.
---
Why would blizzard make a new server just for TBC? If anything they will just release TBC on the current Vanilla server enabling people to progress without any realm change/fresh start and probably make another vanilla server for those wanting a fresh start.
---
Why couldn't they make an "alternate" timeline, but stick to the core values of classic WoW? No flying, no resilience, no lfr, no sharding or phasing, etc.
---
This post nails it. Vocal minorities ruin everything. Politics is the obvious and best example. Just because one person has a view, doesn’t mean the entire “no changes” crowd has the same view. To be honest, I think the tagline for no changes is a big mistake — it promotes fanaticism. Everyone has to align under the same set of views and no one can have an individual opinion without representing the larger group. 
---
My favorite is when this argument happens in general chat while leveling in Westfall. As if anyone in the Westfall zone is looking for a Dire Maul group.
---
I wouldn't mind starting fresh but I doubt they'd do it because of the truck loads of money they could make from character transfers.
---
But to be real, actual TBC started with everyone having their epic mounts &amp; gold etc. so I don't think it's really that big of a deal.
---
WOTLK and all you had were Travelers Backpacks?
---
What I would like is, instead of raising the lick of new raids they could add to classic, make effects that could be useful, example, dragon soul had good effects that was harder to get than previous raids and a little I’ll increase but effects that were amazing, would love to see effects similar to these implemented into raids past naxx, for me at least it would be fun

:(

Spriest is so good lol.

FFXIV is sating my raiding/mmo desires.
---
Vanilla pservers are sating my desire to practice my early levelling routes and trying out different classes.

DotA 2 also has a pretty good meta at the moment, so enjoying that!

Private server
---
I did the same. It's to ensure that I don't come back.
---
We all know how addictive the game is.
---
Hunter! It's what i played in BC and Wrath before i quit. So much fun to play, excited to see how they were in vanilla
---
Yeah 18 and there's no way they would include the +4 slots for the main bag.
---
not only do i much prefer vanilla to tbc, at no point did i ever state otherwise. literally all i said was that tbc wasn't the antichrist lol, it's still FAR different from retail
---
Zelda questline. 
---
no. shaman 8/8 is very good
---
I really hope they leave focus in, it was so convenient when multiboxing
---
priests dont go for 8/8 t1, belt, chest and head are pretty bad. shaman does however.
---
I find it odd that you have exactly 2000 life.
---
&gt; There are many people claiming that Decursive was 'broken' by the addon API changes in 1.12
---
Wait...what?  I thought Decursive was disabled during vanilla?
---
You are not a failure! You're just still progressing to greatness :)
---
except you cant actually use this for 19 twink (the nets) since they all give exp :D
---
18 is the biggest. It’s called Bottomless Bag and it’s very expensive. The other option is to get the 18 slot Onyxia bag. 
---
There certainly was, i cant remember now though
---
Wholeheartedly have to disagree. Post-Wrath is a very different game but Legion was a VERY good expansion. 
---
They might just follow everquest logic with progression servers. At the end your character has the option to restart or transfer to a current server.
---
It is no exaggeration, i abandoned my warrior because it was so boring to level prot

piccolo of the flaming fire is by far my favorite item in the game.  Dropped by Hearthsinger Forresten in Stratholme. Won’t help you level or quest or get better gear but is super fun to play in crowded parts of major cities or while waiting for that one guy to show up to the raid. 
---
well, patch 2.0 AFAIK.. so is that technically vanilla or TBC? :)
---
Nothing should be changed. This game should be a museum experience, both good and bad preserved.
---
Neverwinter. Mod 16 in particular looks promising. Shouldn't be so much of a faceroll.
---
Yeah, usually only the most bored or wealthiest people go for 18 slots.
---
16 across the board like normal people is the most economic, usually after you hit 60.
---
I'm only at 6 so far.

What a legend.

I played Guild Wars before Wow, I still laugh at the idea of raid lockouts and being able to reenter a dungeon after a wipe without it resetting. But hey, there's a bigger outcry for classic wow than gw1 getting server upgrades so here I am. 
---
You gotta get to somewhere around level 20 to see how the class plays in wailing caverns. 
---
Yep, so you need to hearth / city port to keep it.
---
You are right. Since there was one fight where he had to use a racial ability, all the other fights he's ever fought are also worthless. 
---
I was born in 2001, too, and I'm pretty stoked. I played vanilla and TBC (not well, and I only remember snippets) but my older sister and I managed to get my Gnome warlock to 60 a couple weeks before TBC released (we made him pretty early into the expansion). I've played private servers now pretty extensively and fallen in love with it, so I'm just as hyped, since I don't really like the current state of WoW. 
---
Druid. Then you can do everythimg! 
---
Fun fact at level 60 shaman and mage are the only two classes with base hp divisible by 10. So they can get perfectly round numbers like the one in this screenshot at max level.
---
Rogue should probably be mining and engi.  
---
There are three problems with this strategy: 1, you'd have to have money to buy surplus leather (which you won't have), 2, people will have to sell to you for quite a bit higher than vendor, otherwise the inconvenience will simply not be worth it for an extra 5-10 silver, and 3, you can just farm leather yourself. 
---
The great thing about being a leatherworker is that there are quite a few areas for both Druids and Rogues where low to mid armour targets can be easily farmed. As i mentioned in another thread, LW can give you some pretty decent pieces while you're leveling to help fill in some gaps. Ultimately though, you will always have the same problem you mentioned above for every single crafting profession. Dungeons always have better loot, that's the incentive to do them.
---
Sword of Omen + Vanquisher's Sword on a 40-something rogue.  Name a more iconic duo, I'll wait.
---
People will HATE you for this item, and that's exactly why I always try to get it.  
---
&gt; The entire point of a res run is that you are planning to take people who do want the same loot as you, but you feel you are more entitled to it (exclusively) than them despite both of you putting in the same time and effort.
---
*Only if* they want to go on the run despite the fact it was advertised as a reserve run with that one item reserved. Nobody makes them do that.
---
&gt; If this were not the case (example: you brought a lock, mage, and ret - people who wouldn't want your DPS 1H anyway) you wouldn't have needed to make reservations in the first place. The ONLY reason to make loot reservations is to deny others who do want it.
---
No. The reason to make loot reservations is so that others who do want it never join the run in the first place. It's saying "Don't come, unless you didn't want that loot anyway". If you don't like it then you can start your own group with your own loot rules.
---
Nobody is "planning to take people who do want the same loot as you". The point is the exact opposite of what you said. It's to avoid taking people who do want the same loot as you.
---
Used to use that farming method in the Mechanar to pay for my raiding enchants/consumables on my rogue. Pull the group with a throwing weapon while on a ledge and pick the chest after a vanish. Really was fantastic until it was nerfed.
---
T1 is shit for warrior
---
this isn't runescape
---
No. The deadzone is the same size, just further away from the hunter which makes it a bit harder to get out of melee range.
---
I used my rogue to farm the chests up to the first boss in Mana-Tombs. Paid for epic flying on 3 toons with that. I accept my role in chests being removed from dungeons. Definitely good times.
---
Any video using Remember the Name by Fort Minor
---
Why whine when people suggest changes to classic? You honestly think we just want classic for a fun little nostalgia trip? No ffs classic was far from perfect, we want classic because it was better than the shit show that is current wow.
---
There are a couple things that I think would need to be done to maybe make additional content successful
---
1. Some class mechanics/coefficients would need to be adjusted to keep classes scaling more closely. Warriors can't have rage become an unlimited resource for example, and dual wield scales really well
---
2. Nax gear might need to be adjusted, it was designed to be overpowered final gear if it isn't the final gear anymore all gear afterwards would become just as crazy
---
3. New raids would have more powerful monsters, not just in health pool. More armor and spell resistance specifically, and maybe even higher level to require more hit from gear. Items dropped would have most of the increased stats be armor pen and spell pen and maybe hit chance. This way you would grow more powerful on raid night quickly with upgrades but out in open world and pvp you wouldn't be as powerful since overcap hit and spell pen don't help on easier content/lower geared players
---
At least that would be my approach.
---
I played Wow until WOTLK on a 2002 Compaq computer that had 256mb ram and a single core 1.4ghz amd processor. Integrated video card of course. I upgraded to 1gb ram a year after playing 
---
I got 8 fps out in the open and 4 fps around people. I'd run through cities zoomed in all the way and facing my camera down and navigate the map for the first year.
---
After that I bought the gb of ram and jumped to 15 fps in the open and 10 near people. 
---
Fun times 
---
The default radius of friendly totems is 20 yards and that range can be extended to 30 yards by the talent in the resto tree or by the 3 piece T1 set bonus. The radius increasing effects don't stack though as they both set the totem effect radius to 30.
---
I had a much better pc than that and I remember watching framerates dip down to 1 or 2 during raids. 
---
Bears where master race tanks leveling up, the only problem was you where competing with ferals, rogues, hunters, and some times warriors/rets for gear. Warrior tanks 9/10 times only had to deal with a rogue for melee 1 handers/some leather or a ret for plate. 
---
Absolutely agree, as well for other specs deemed shite 15 years ago. Bears will be utilised alot more now on fights that don't have crushing blow. 
---
Or be the main tank in a guild and roll enchanting/engineering and laugh your way to the bank.
---
On your server maybe.  On blood hoof, it was 80% “DM”, 20% “VC”
---
Rewatching that video these days really opened my eyes. He was so terrible. He always had pocket healers and most of his clips are from a time when there was a bug where you could get 1 extra talent point and arms warriors used that to get both MS and deathwish at the same time. Combine that with the fact he was one of the first r14 warriors and no wonder he destroyed everything he touched. At the time we thought he was a deity, these days hes bronze trash 
---
waiting on Sekiro, then waiting on MK11 then waiting on Classic.
---
what
---
REmake is fucking beautiful. 
---
Basically, this. 
---
Horde had 7 world first boss kills in Vanilla, Alliance had 36.
---
So disappointed that no one has linked the N-server 80 page in-depth post mortem document, which delineates this in painstaking detail. 
---
Transfers. That’s the purpose of classic. 
---
It does. 
---
There are exceptions,  but it mainly flows this way. 
---
lol ya I didn't raid at all the only time I tried was Karazhan 10 man (I started WoW in TBC) I didn't even attempt anything that required more people than 10
---
since u like skyrim but want a more rpg experience, try Enderal! (it's on steam for free if u own old skyrim)
---
&gt; Sm is my most ran dungeon also there’s like 9+ alliance quests there? 
---
Like two, three if you're a mage.  And the main quest requires you to complete an annoying chain (for the level you're anticipating to enter SM) in Desolace.  
---
Even our simple peons could understand basic concepts of lingual context, so we never had a problem when a level 18 was asking to run DM, or if a level 58.
---
There’s was also a 18 slot from the Panther Boss in ZG, and one from the Undead Invasion Naxxramas content in Eastern Plaguelands.
---
This guy gets it
---
Unsigned because you can’t have negative level. Why waste a bit keeping track of the sign if there is only positive values. Float and double are overkill because you can’t have fractional numbers. If 8 bit unsigned int isn’t enough, next best is unsigned unsigned 16 bit integer. Really no other options.
---
Try 6 fps.. on a pc with 18 total gigs of memory storage. Not sure how I made it work 
---
Same thing the Horde always did, also DM.
---
It seems like the last few threads its strictly a NA Alliance thing with VC.
---
Raiding aq on main priest and alt mage and working through hunter bow quest on other alt on a ps
---
Well shit I got 8 hours to kill, lets roll.
---
-Says the level 19 rogue.
---
Sorry, not sorry.
---
I play on a private server and it’s pretty much the same exact game and community as I remember in vanilla all those years ago. Don’t know what everyone is freaking out about.
---
Wait, so are we running Cookie Cavern, or are all these level 19 warriors looking for more crowd control?!
---
What mad times.
---
#12 had me creased 
---
Did they update the chest model at some point?
---
You can have a 2nd character kill while you are in the party but dead. This gives you the looting opportunity without gaining experience. 
---
I did this 'trick' with my level 1 twink to get a red defias mask so I could put a +8agil libram on it.
---
It’s a good thing that didn’t make it into the Classic Demo Duel tournaments. The battlefield would be covered in glue.
---
Troll (berserking racial) is great for pve, but I'd recommend orc. The stun resist in pvp is a game-changer, in a way that a minor haste buff every 3 minutes is not.
---
That said, troll do have excellent casting animations 
---
I'm raiding Naxx and still have those items in my bank.
---
But one day... one day there will be the perfect opportunity to use them...
---
The Luffa is from Searing Gorge.
---
It's just ret paladins wanting continual stuns on all their mobs for extra Command judges for double damage.
---
What I'd do for 2 pocket rogues while leveling.
---
&gt; Btw, this was before you could enable your character's name.
---
What?  
---
Lvl 32 dwarf pally about to get fking lit up by 60 Tauren warrior 
---
My best bet is the [Pendant of Myzrael](http://classicdb.ch/?item=4614) that informs the player to go the Arathi Basin to "save the princess".
---
Or [Theldurin the Lost](http://classicdb.ch/?npc=2785) who starts that quest in The Badlands
---
Unfortunately the best tanking weapon for the entirety of vanilla and half of the following expansion will not be going to rogues who just don't really need it. 
---
Crystal restores from ungoro pillars
---
I actually love doing Deadmines as Horde. It’s pretty easy to get to, compared to the SFK run for Alliance. Just zeppelin to Grom Gol, jump off the zeppelin into the water, travel as a group and just swim due north til you but west fall. Takes 10 minutes to get from Org to Deadmines. The hard part is convincing people that it really isn’t that far, or not getting ganked by 60s in Westfall.
---
No one's got it yet, so a clue.
---
"Shards" refers to sharding.
---
Slowly upgrading my computer to the latest and greatest tech. Goin for a freesync monitor and x4 M.2 ssd. Still have DDR3 ram too, so imma have to upgrade my mobo, so I’m making the transition from intel to amd, going for a cpu with high single-core speed cause apparently that’s more important for wow.
---
Writing code and trying to learn unity. I just don't feel like playing any other games lately. Oh and I just started to have classic dreams.
---
&gt;there's no way they would include the +4 slots for the main bag.
---
It was in the demo client.
---
A server population I can communicate with. It’s not that I’m xenophobic, and I have had some great experiences with people from across the world on Private servers. 
---
But with a population of 6-8k concurrent, that’s 3-4K people to compete with that you can’t benefit from, because it’s difficult to group/raid with people when you can’t socialize well in a social game. There’s more people to farm the mobs, herbs, and ore, more people to gank me, yet still only the baseline 3k I can communicate with.
---
Which, by the way, if the toon is 60 or above (as it seems to be in this case!) It's eligible for restoration in game still! They don't permanently delete those
---
I wonder if that will dampen the effects of the fresh phenomenon. If servers are more permanent in nature, will a fresh server be less appealing to some amount of people? Possibly. Everybody on the oroginal server is likely less devoted to their original toon anyways, since they know what they’re signing on for with a private server.
---
Well, that warlock will get fat.
---
Nova
---
Hey! I listen to your videos on YT often while I am at work. So peaceful and soothing. I often comment on your videos and encourage people to look for Classic WoW coming out soon!
---
Thank you for your work!
---
I would love if they would let you transfer but also beable to stay on the vanilla server. Like a copy of your character. I would like to have a character in vanilla and level in TBC.
---
That way i don't have to go through the content i just went through again. It would keep me playing classic and be fun to play TBC.
---
Though, either way i would play both. TBC is my favorite part of the game but i never got to actually play vanilla (except the last few weeks of it). 
---
I seriously cannot wait for Classic. I am already trying to figure out how im going to split my time between it, BFA, and the real world. 
---
Mine is and always will be the Sorrow Hill series by Otherguy
---
Daftibellend
---
I know you probably don't care to try Retail and are looking forward to Classic. But, as this toon is presumably above level 60, if you remember the realm and account, he is still there and eligible for Restoration! Obviously he will suffer a mild case of being naked, and probably sitting in the GY of Thunder Bluff or Bloodhoof Vilage alive if I had to guess! But I just wanted you to know :)
---
It is if you are undead.
---
I forgot about that bug but yeah I do remember one of his videos was with that bug (though he had some other cool ones).
---
Honestly though, it was next to impossible to tell a good warrior in a video in those days. Everyone just put in their highlight reels with healers and full groups stomping PUGs. I played with Pat and he was definitely a better player than a highlight video makes it look. The guild at the time was also raiding in like that tier where we would never have any recognition off the server but were good enough that I don't think any of the warriors in the guild (myself included) would have ever gone to a BG without a group. You just never had to. The dude pushed hard though for that rank 14.
---
For resto in PvE of course.
---
But for anything else a shaman is doing it just ain't that great.
---
What are hero items?
---
Private server 
---
Those stupid infinite population caps.
---
Holy shit I can’t breathe lmao
---
Okay, makes sense.  And if I remember right, Soul Link was deactivated with Phase Shift.  Then again, if they have Soul Link, why would they use anything but a Voidwalker in PVP?  I guess you could make an argument for the Felhunter's +resistances from Master Demonologist or the Succubus's Seduction skill, but I figure you'd always want -10% physical damage taken with Voidwalker's Master Demonologist effect on top of its high health and Sacrifice.  Haha, what a nightmare...ugh.
---
I was about to down vote you, but decided to toss my playtime into a calculator to get hours. And uh, oof, you might be right, OP probably underestimated as much as I just did though
---
you can jump in the little pool beneath.
---
This comic template is amazing. What is it called? Even without context, I'm dying from laughter.
---
What pserver are you referring to? The blizzlike ~2k pop server I play on has general "Barrens Chat" levels of retardedness in world chat, but nothing beyond that. And even that is rare and tame.
---
I never once felt like there was not enough moderation (in terms of public chat).
---
Yeah, I sold mine for 6 hundo. Way better investment. Actually around June/July of 2009 so I at least got to enjoy ulduar
---
wrote from the heart brotha +1 to this
---
It is not just data being stored on a disk in a closet. It is data in a live database that is being constantly read from and written to. It is taking up memory on the server, in the client, and takes up bandwidth to be sent back and forth. 
---
It is not just 4 bytes times a billion records, it is 4 bytes times a billion records times thousands of transactions per minute every day over the past 14 years all adding up.
---
That is a lot of saved electricity for a simple type change that has no adverse effect on the product. Couple that with other savings and the benefit becomes more apparent. 
---
The next time I am reading about a AAA game that runs like shit on top end computers, I am going to think about how adamantly you argued that optimization is pointless. 
---
It also saves them a lot of headache in regard to breached accounts. I could definitely seeing them keeping the +4 in.
---
Blizzard was (is?) famous with their customers for announcing something is coming "soon" but not actually delivering in a time frame most people would call "soon." It happened frequently enough that it was "soon (tm)" as in trademarked by Blizzard because we all knew the meaning was soon for Bliizzard, not soon by any reasonable standard. I'm not sure when it actually became widely used, but it was pretty common during vanilla and TBC for Blizzard to announce they were doing something soon and the community to refer to it as "coming soon (tm)."
---
As Valtieri said, there's no need to be prot to tank dungeons. I believe the first time I specced Protection was either Blackwing Lair or AQ40.
---
Astonishing that no one mentioned the classic and highly sought after name from Vanilla:
---
**Gnomage.**
---
I just hope they change - their minds on sharding because of how badly that would impact not just the game but the reception of the target audience.
---
You seem confused about how the database would be handled. Why would the complete database be transmitted thousands of times per minute? Also, electricity and processing is highly dependent on the hardware and networking, MTU, compression, yada yada.
---
The next time I see somebody just conjure up weird crackpot arguments, I am going to think about how you just threw numbers into a mixing bowl and tried to get a strawman argument going. Or maybe not, not sure if I care enough. In the meantime, be sure to clean your Windows registry and remove those orphaned keys, seeing as how much they must be slowing your system down. Cause that's how databases work, yes. 
---
Sharding has already been stated as a limited, release only thing. 
---
I’m not for changes, but I can live with one that is essentially just there for the initial rush and will (theoretically) never be seen again. 
---
The loot trading is b.s though. I don’t know what they’re thinking with that. I’d rather them just make it where GMs won’t ever allow bound loot to be traded if the ticket volume is such a big deal. 
---
https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=1599
---
no changes 
---
Idk, I'd rather it be crowded (NOT NEARLY AS CROWDED AS PRIVATE SERVER LAUNCHES SO WTF IS EVERYONE EVEN WORRIED ABOUT) than feel like I had a different experience than others. I want everyone on my server to remember the same amazing things that happen. The same amazing fights that go down. If there is 100 level 1 Gnomes in Durotar on launch day, I WANT TO FUCKING SEE IT, PERIOD.
---
yes after looking in old databases there were 3 quests plus the mage quest. i was thinking there was a separate quest for each wing final boss.
---
but i repeatedly ran the library at 29 on my warrior to get a wonderful epic ring. however i was prone to run a lot of dungeons for pvp based loot tables so bis *9 level brackets.
---
This. I messed around a little with a Warrior (only got to around level 12) before I stopped playing. There’s no way I could actually sink time into something that can be shut down without notice. 
---
hot take
---
Still playing retail WoW. Now, my idea of playing is leveling up characters I have never really played (mage) and running old content for dungeon, raid, profession, and reputation mounts. I pretty much do my emissaries and then leave Zandalar/Kul Tiris.
---
I do plan on taking some online classes soon so I might take a break until Classic.
---
Also, ESO. I have had an account since launch but I play about once and every few months. Recently, I have been playing more often and am enjoying it.
---
You're gonna waste time posting on Reddit when you could be grinding to level 33?  That'll cost you the record. 
---
You say that individual servers cannot last, and it is only fresh servers keeping the private scene alive. Blizzard can also launch fresh servers but you “doubt will be a thing with official servers”. 
---
Launching fresh servers was part of the vanilla experience. Blizzard was launching new servers like crazy. They had new realms every few weeks, 33 new US realms in the first year, 66 in the second. 
---
Back then they did it to accommodate a growing player base (and who is to say that is not still a legitimate reason for Classic), but it does not change the fact that it happened and there were almost always fresh servers to play on for the first two years. 
---
I think Fresh Servers is part of the legit vanilla experience, and I think Blizzard will spawn new realms when necessary to keep Classic alive. 
---
I've never actually heard Dire Maul being referred to as DM... DM was always Deadmines. Some people said VC for VanCleef, sure, but Dire Maul was always the wing; or, in many cases, DrM... I feel like people are forgetting about DrM
---
loot trading encourages you to make friends lmao 
---
it will once blizzard launches official vanilla servers. Due to the law they will have to shut down.
---
- Lower (normal) server population
---
- Fewer Chinese
---
- No more corrupt GMs/Devs
---
- Server/character permanence
---
- Concurrent online players, meaning that during EU prime time, there will be a lot of people online, and 4 AM on EU time there will be almost no one online. On private servers there is prime time all the time because time zones from all over the world are on there.
---
Yes obviously the entire thing is not being sent every transaction but the existence of larger types in the table will make each of those transaction take longer. Taking longer means more electricity consumed and it also means more wear on the drives which leads to reduced performance and reduced lifespan which also means extra cost to replace disks more frequently. 
---
Way to get hung up on irrelevant details in an effort to mask your evasion of the point. 
---
They will if it’s popular and they can make more money
---
Watching all of Shedothedruid's content on Feral in vanilla 
---
Looking for Koralin/Genjiro (shaman/rogue) from Ner'zhul - If you're out there bud I've love to reconnect with you. 
---
It looks like you’re at a loading screen for a pirated version of the game to play an illegal private server. I’m calling the WoW police and sending them this post.
---
If you hit 60 in Winterspring, is it pointless to do quests in Silithus, EPL or Blasted Lands because you are not going to level further?
---
Fucking spot on. Guess you triggered a few of them to down doot you lmao
---
Welcome back friend. May we shed alliance blood together
---
2004 Strategy Guide on release referred to it as VC. 
---
(X) Doubt
---
There's really not much of a market for "hardcore" time-consuming MMOs these days. Wildstar tried the same thing and flopped horribly.  I highly doubt Classic will be "popular" enough to warrant adding new content to it. (which goes against what has been said so far, about Classic being more of a preservation project)
---
Currently playing on a tbc private server
---
The only things that have changed since the announcement are that I read this subreddit 3+ times a day and have started doing some scheduling for the summer+beyond.
---
Otherwise its the same old (types of) games, same interests and so on compared to post-'nilla (except now I am not in school anymore, woo!).
---
Lower damage than arms or fury means slower mob kill times which means more damage taken which means even more time eating and bandaging than other warriors, which is already considerable. And for leveling dungeons, I've heard some say that tanking them as prot is actually more difficult due to lower damage and difficulty generating rage.
---
Level 42 in Hillsbrad, a 20-low 30s zone. Nice.
---
Screenshot uploaded to reddit while flying from one zone to another to continue leveling fast AF. Boom, karma.
---
I played Vanilla for two whole years and I never made it past level 32.  I was stranded in Stranglethorn Vale, mindlessly killing NPCs for months on end - picking fights with every enemy player and getting smashed half the time  -- I loved every second of it.
---
They screwed up their servers so much who even knows if they can make a proper non sharded experience to begin with. A 15 year old game can handle 40v40 better than what we have now.
---
Most of the old devs are gone. They got weeded out and replaced by people who were never the reason wow was a success.
---
It's because they don't trust the current wow team. Already the changes announced have massive collateral damage potential.
---
Playing TBC on Netherwing 
---
I play vermintide 2 and total war: warhammer 2 because the world is similar to wows. (Low power fantasy) Also trying to get some workout done.
---
Replaying Ultima VII: The Black Gate and a bit of Heroes of the Storm. I got Thimbleweed Park free off Epic Store, so I will be playing that when I’m done with Ultima.
---
Might do Ultima VII: Serpent Isle afterwards, but these Ultima games are time-consuming projects to take on.
---
Every single time a private server has progressed to TBC it has died, even while keeping the old Vanilla server with optional character copies.
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
Releasing TBC is a very efficient way to kill Vanilla WoW a second time.
---
I hope that if sharding is a thing it only is in the sub 20 zones.
---
Sharding at least has a reasonable end.
---
Loot sharing however can be abused for the whole of classic
---
[Orb of Deception](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1973)
---
The “show players name plate above head” thing 
---
This trick also grants allows rep sharing and can be used to farm timbermaul rep for [the furbolg medicine pouch](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=16768#sold-by) which is nuts on twinks.
---
They had that in the demo?
---
Did they have a graphics toggle?! I didn’t play the demo
---
This really resonated with me. I had a similar moment, WoW was detrimental to my university grades, all I did was work and play wow (I was happy, but knew it wasn't a health balance). I made the call, and deleted my character. I'm embarrassed to say I'm fairly certain I cried.
---
Though you never 'quit' wow, I came back in Wrath and have been subbed on and off since. Although now the balance is a lot better (things like LFR honestly helped it).
---
Thanks for sharing your story. 
---
This moderation is low effort.
---
Thanks mate 👍🏻
---
What are you talking about, do you honestly think LFG was a good contribution to WOTLK, for example and do you think the majority of people that want WOTLK servers, want that back?
---
Sure I am all for #nochanges when it makes sense, but do we really just want to go back in history and make the same bad decisions all over again.
---
The possibly slightly inaccurate resistance values on bosses etc will not factor into BiS lists at all until at least AQ40 stage with spell pen gear.
---
The biggest question mark is how Classic will handle itemization. Until pservers, there won't be blizzlike item progression (ironically).
---
So the question is: will the ST quests be available? Will "Naxx blues" be in dungeons? Will "of Shadow Wrath" items be in the loot tables? Etc, etc.
---
There were a lot of blue items and green items and quests added during various patch cycles which pservers recreate.
---
We already know that Classic won't have a completely blizzlike content cycle, unlike pservers, and instead will have "content buckets."
---
As of now we have no idea how they will handle all these items so BiS lists are up in the air.
---
No they had slightly better graphic options (view distance water texture) but no models nor is it likely. You will have this super high-res models with muddy textured gear on it.
---
Did the same, vanilla to wotlk ending then cashed out selling my awesome hunter. Never again had the same fun whit online games. Miss those people/miss that fun
---
no, i don't care for lfg, but asking for everything on your vanilla server to stay just the way it was while asking for changes to tbc and wotlk makes no sense. if somebody's favorite version of the game was say, tbc, and they came in here asking for changes to vanilla they would 1) be laughed out of the subreddit 2) told that perhaps they should just play the version they prefer rather than changing another to suit their fancy.
---
there are pros and cons for lfg and manual grouping, no point in arbitrarily changing a game feature some people might prefer when you've got the version you want right there. if blizzard is going to make authentic vanilla servers and then they move onto tbc and wotlk, no reason not to make them authentic too. and no, ''i don't want to split the playerbase by allowing them to get their favorite version like i did'' isn't a reason.
---
btw since i feel like i have to say this or people will eat me alive, i hate lfg and vastly prefer manual grouping. vanilla is my favorite era of the game. but the hypocrisy of people who will rabidly argue for nochanges vanilla and in the same breath say, well some changes are ok for tbc and wotlk is astounding tbh
---
Warrior bg (Tauren Warrior)
---
Sharding and Personal Loot called. They said you're a hypocrite.
---
But in the end, it doesn't even matter.
---
No, please explain to me what you did there.
---
Do you think there is the same kind of vitriol for the current respec fee in vanilla than there is for LFG?
---
Do you think it was flying mounts that started killing world pvp or is it summoning stones that is the greater threat?
---
I am just saying let's just get rid of the changes that was despised by many of the community and in the end of the day, why wouldn't you make the heroic dungeons harder, when you can simply clear them while sleeping on your keyboard. And to be honest, I would be open to the changes you just proposed. I am only for #nochanges when it makes sense, but just #nochanges overall is retarded to me
---
I commend you for having the strength and ability to drop a life-consuming habit like that, truly.
---
But he will return!
---
Studying like a madman! I play retail and watch videos of old raids in my downtime.
---
I play FFXIV for dungeon crawling and eso for quests and exploring.
---
Wrong. Loot trading discourages you from grouping with random people - which is the very method new friendships *were* formed in Vanilla.
---
18 slot bags are pretty expensive, but worthwhile if your a hunter or warlock due to losing a bag to soul shards and ammo.  
---
i wouldn't mind if they made the game the way it was originally intended specifically summon stones working (even if its later on) also, i cant remember if it was in the end of vanilla or start of burning crusade but they had a crude lfg no teleportation and you could be a priest and say you wanted to tank anyone remember when that was?
---
&gt;I just hope they change
---
REEEE NO CHANGES
---
Same here, will play for the lore,  adventure,  nostalgia,  feels,  atmosphere,  music and well,  pvp and other game related things,  but mostly for the ones I mentioned first. 
---
Thanks! Appreciate the support :) 
---
It's only just the way I hold the book,  I assure you,  the hands are of human race. 
---
By that logic, they shouldn't release TBC at all because there are bound to be vanilla players who won't play it and the release itself would split the base.
---
How about instead of rolling undead like a shitta, you learn the game? 
---
I mean you can do that of course. Maintanks can get 1 profession outside of engineering. It was more if you want 2 "real" professions then healer is probably the best bet.
---
How about in stead of stating things that are objectively wrong you fuck right off? You want to flex nuts? Find a new slant.
---
Wotlk would have been the perfekt expansion if they removed catchup mechanics and LFG...
---
Lucky enough to find a pserver removing the Catchup system
---
I mean somewhat yes? Depends if you are a threatwhore from private servers or not. But even then, you probably still get it just in case you need other stats, or the fury warriors get it in case they have to tank something.
---
I had a theory that maybe what servers used VC was based on server age. I'd seen arguments that it was originally DM then changed to VC after Dire Maul released which would imply older servers would be more likely to call it VC. But this didn't make much sense considering EU players have consistently said Deadmines is shortened to DM and Dire Maul was launch content for them. I've seen people say that it was called VC early on because it was the earliest dungeon and the quest was about killing Van Cleef, which would imply servers created earlier in the game's life would be more likely to call it VC. 
---
So I started looking through the sub to see what abbreviations people claimed their servers used. I ignored EU and horde players since it seems pretty well established that EU and horde primarily used DM. What I found was that literally every single NA alliance player that has listed their server has said their server used VC except two instances. [One](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/awqdkd/dm_dead_mines_or_dire_maul_summarized_for_your/ehpq5se/) [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9zdzk0/old_vanilla_vs_private_server_terminology/ea8zo9e/) And that first comment was in response to someone from the same server claiming it was VC which has another person agreeing that it was VC on that server. I've found about 20 different servers that have all had alliance players saying it was VC, both on servers created before and after Dire Maul released (including servers released after TBC launched).
---
Here's the list of servers I've seen people on this sub mention VC was used on: Arthas, Lightbringer, Khadgar, Archimonde, Burning Blade, Garona, Uther, Frostmane, Azgalor, Crushridge, Shadowmoon, Kel'thuzad, Elune, Burning Blade, Draenor, Drak'thul, Ursin, Ysondre, Kirin Tor, Rexxar, Blackrock, Mannoroth, Magtheridon, Firetree (not seen on the sub, but this is the server I played on, and we used VC)
---
Here's the list I've seen people mention DM was used on: Arthas, Magtheridon
---
So what's the deal? Do people who claim their servers used DM just have an aversion to listing what server they played on for some reason?
---
rubbin one out 
---
Playing warcraft 1 - 3 for lore and warcraft history. Such amazing games
---
Yes I agree it's very very unlikely blizzard will start fresh, but I would still pref it.
---
Sure in actual TBC everyone started with some gold... It is probably not going to be the same though.. People didn't exploit various gold farming spots to inflate the economy back in vanilla, hopefully they won't on classic, but that requires blizzard to take actions against things like DM tribute hunter farming. 
---
Long AVs are the biggest annoyance on private servers. 
---
That is not literally what it means not. 
---
There's a difference between wanting to preserve the integrity and feeling of the game, and wanting ragnaros to have the exact same armor and health values, especially wanting that, after blizzard decides to have 16 debuff slots and 1.12 patches from the start.
---
That latter is MORONIC.  
---

Exactly, a custom quest tracker. Simplest version would be to track items to farm. Another example:
---
Goal: 20 grilled winter squid
---
Tasks:
---
 - get the reciepe in steamwheedle
---
- fish 20 winter squids
---
It could also be used as "shopping list" for preBiS
---
&gt;online client it means people don't have to keep bookmarks to various spreadsheets around vs going to www.bis-list.com or something
---
But you can do the exact same by just having 1 spreadsheet that covers all classes/specs (you can have mulitple tabs ), and then putting that on a website called bis-list.com. It's practically the same thing, except you get real concrete data instead of a page telling you to get this, this and this item instead of telling you why.
---
Example of such "site", this is for TBC: https://legacy-wow.com/tbc-pre-raid-gear-list/
---
Just about every change implemented up until retail was asked for by players. This is not the attitude we want with classic.
---
We just want classic 
---
He said he had hundreds of hours in game over 3 expansions!!
---
I'm so used to staff swings between wand shots (it's all private servers' bug), so it will be already a huge change for me on retail(((
---
I am not stating things that are objectively wrong at all what the fuck are you on about? Sure you CAN avoid all fears with a undead, but I sure as hell don't expect every guild to have a undead tank esp because it only helps you on 3 fights in the entire game and most people aren't that stupid.  
---
So you are saying that players don't know what they want, but you want classic?
---
HMMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
No
---
If you are Alliance, obviously Dead Mines, however for Horde its surely Dire Maul. For the Horde.
---
Then stop being nonsensical 
---
I’m saying the exact words I just typed out in my response.
---
I’m not?
---
You apparently know exactly what I am on about, just because it is bis in one situation doesn’t mean it is optimal to run. The fact is you can do it if you want to. In your original statement you stated quite the contrary. Every guild won’t run troll dw fury prot main tanks even when it is optimal at the right gear/effort levels. So your point is kind of moot.
---
I started playing a bit after the EU launch, but on the US servers. My very first character was 15 days /played to hit 60, which is 360 hours. To. Hit. 60. I quit towards the end of TBC and I had multiple characters with over 100 days played each. I'd wager most players have 1000+ hours in game.
---
Have my upvote.
---
Sometimes I think the people crying for changes are actually [Current xpac shills] who just want classic to fails and in order to make that happen they sow discord amongst the ranks by suggesting stupid casual changes that triggers us.
---
This goes for hundreds of gold

It just turned out that A LOT OF people don't know they can shift click to check someone's level.

Why do you think this? Sounds like confirmation bias.
---
*This is what I think, and being a person of sound mind surely everyone else must also think like me*
---
That being said, I'm not entirely against it. We'll see. I'd rather have no changes at all in terms of gameplay mechanics but more content added after 2-3 years from release.
---
People forget the game was released in 2004. Internet speeds were horrible back then, 56k dialup was still used by a lot of people. I was lucky, my family had an ADSL connection that would sit around 700k. Shaving off unnecessary data use was essential.
---
Just basing it on the general opinion I’ve seen on this reddit
---
Can you link the specs?
---
Since they are using the old code, they have much better latency when dealing with large battles than current blizzard servers. Hard to believe but its true. My guess is, after wow took off, all the money chasing sharks took over development and they cut costs/got lazy with the servers.
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **5th Cakeday** qplas! ^(hug)
---
It could be different 5 minutes apart in Westfall chat on the same server. Some people say VC, same say DM, some say "what's VC and DM" cause they don't know.
---
That would only be possible in the 30-35 range of what you mentioned
---
They are using a modern engine and modern servers, with all of the cost cutting bullshit they ruined the game with. There is a chance Classic shits the bed and is a huge letdown.
---
You're right, it will be different. And people know exactly what to expect in TBC, they'll know to save up certain mats, have 5k ready for epic flying etc.
---
I think best case we can hope for is character transfers, with maybe a few week waiting period after launch and strict limits on what can be xfer'd over.
---
You get it by looting a sachel on the bottom of one of the small pools in south eastern Ungoro.
---
It is a very long quest chain that rewards alot of XP and a few fun items.

I think he was the guy who levelled to 60 naked and without any weapons.  He might have only melee attached too.

I could be way wrong.

The vocal minority always beats the silent majority in these types of conflicts.

The designers want to create scenarios where players most enjoy their hard work - and the vocal minority makes sure they get what they want.
---
i'm all for higher res models as a toggle if people want them, but it seems unlikely that it'll happen, unfortunately. :( i remember we used to have a toggle for them on modern, but it was just the 2004 skins over the new models or something and it was really poorly done and not at all like the old ones, then when they revamped the combat animations they removed the toggle alltogether. idk if it was because they couldn't manage both at one time or if they just didn't want to bother with it or what, but i would be surprised if they went for it here. i'm holding out hope for those who want it tho
---
Me too, idea is to get it all out of my system by the time classic launches.
---
It hasn’t been a waste of time though. I have rediscovered how much I love healing. I’m now like 95% I want to play shaman.
---
Think now I’m going to roll a paladin and casually heal dungeons until vanilla, separate class+faction so I don’t get burnt out on it before launch. 
---
It's so odd seeing the differences. I had no idea people would say Baron or Scarlet, his post confused me until I saw living or UD.
---
How different is are the healer classes in classic? I only recently joined the WoW and only experienced retail, which was only 2 months. I plan on enjoying the full ride of WoW through classic.
---
Right now I'm torn between a healer class in Alliance or in Horde. What are good references for me to read up on?
---
I don't understand why you would delete, just unsub so your character stays there should you decide to come back
---
I'm not particularly one way or the other on "no change" but fuck cross realm battlegrounds.
---
Is this a lot of health for a level 42 rogue? I remember people having like 2.8k or 3.5k at 60, and typically level 42 gear is horrible greens.

Literally everybody already knows what you’re talking about
---
For the 600th time, there will be only be sharding at launch and only in starting zones ffs
---
Ok well there won't be 100 there will be 1000 per zone. How do you plan to make that not be a painful, non-blizzlike experience?

So basically all you have is the slippery slope fallacy.

I've become more pessimistic as of late.
---
If they are using a modern engine, they are using their modern servers.
---
Its going to be a shitshow and anywhere with more than 20 people will lag to hell. They cut costs and the devs who made wow with passion got weaseled out of power by money sharks, who took over the game after its success.
---
ironically a russian in his basement will have provided a better vanilla experience than modern day blizzard.
---
Do you mean gnomish and goblin? If so, you have to start from 1 again x)
---
nobody goes 8/8 t1 tank
---
Yes I do and I'm sad now :'( ty anyway lol
---
The sensible solution would be to have a no tolerance no GM support policy for "loot issues" and only enable loot trading in Master Looter settings.
---
But that takes dev time and the community to wise up to the problem. So chances of success are low.
---
burst wins early, sustain wins late
---
I think you're right about the mana, which was .5 threat per point regenerated for 25 per JoW.
---
But even if the threat did go to the paladin, it wasn't exactly raid-wide, as almost all your melee (rogues and warriors) wouldn't count. Your healers and casters would barely get procs because of lack of melee hits between casting and not risking standing next to boss. That leaves mainly your hunters, ret pallies and feral druids.
---
JoL, however, should have given threat to the paladin. Paladins only get .25 threat per healing, though. This does take advantage of your warriors and rogues whacking the target, but not if they are at full health and get overhealed. It's still debatable if this is better for threat than JotC in a boss fight, unless someone has done the math.
---
Yeah, that is a problem for me and a lot of others. I want to see everyone on the server. Not some sharded garbage.
---
Once my main is 60, I'll level 5 alts at the same pure with rested exp.
---
a lot
---
I guess its just luck, other servers are more Alliance populated, others are more Horde
---
Read again what I said
---
Nice post man. This sub needs more of this. See you in Azeroth. 
---
most were 480p :\[
---
But..race affects base hp, which races have hp divisible by 10?
---
I feel like you tried to make that sound bad and it just ended up sounding awsome. Like yeah it would be weird but it also sounds legendary and temporary.
---
I bought a new keyboard, mouse and will probably get a bigger monitor to unpack when it launches.  
---
I did play back then, so I have to make it feel new in other ways.
---
If there is sharding in town hubs, cities, or any zone post level 20, I will stay on private servers.
---
Not sure why I'm being downvoted seems like a reasonable question.
---
But why isn't it on the portrait?
---
**There should be zero sharding.**  
---
Read that over and over, until you no longer feel compelled to talk about this with me.
---
I'm not even on private servers anymore ever since F****x shutdown. But if classic disappoints enough, I will find a permanent home on a new private server. 
---
In vanilla it was about 50-50 on pvp servers, and more alliance on pve servers. On rp servers there were way more alliance. 
---
That was why horde got blood elves in tbc, to give them a pretty race to balance out the factions. 
---
Playing different RPGs.
---
Nah I build straight into this. Consecration at 20 lets you start tanking even better early and all the holy talents improve your levelling game. The next 5/5 redoubt is useless levelling early if your 2h ing but is some extra defence when tanking. Then precision is great, especially on dwarfs with no +wpn skill. The extra armour is nice but not essential this early. Then you start to pick up the good stuff. Kings, reckoning, etc. As soon as I get sow I start the aoeing to kill and chuck a 1h and board on
---
The problem is the reward system then. Rewards should be based on kills and objectives rather than games played. 
---
Got a source for the article? I was there and would like to read more if they covered anything else from that time period :D
---
You've got it all mixed up. 
---
The one I linked from web.archive.org is the correct vanilla version, with 3.4k armor. This version is inferior to the saph shield, and is only used by casters
---
In the OP, the video displays a version of the shield from the TBC prepatch, with 3.9k armor. This version is superior to the Saph shield, and is wanted by warriors.
---
31pts in Holy are pretty much wasted, so you have enough Pts to get some Damage Talents.
---
It’s a good idea but a lot easier said than done from a dev point of view. Not worth delaying the game for imo
---
Yeah so? That's vanilla.

---
Whirlwind axe + overly confident swagger in STV on a lv 30 warrior.
---
&gt;All these fears are raid-wide fears(unless if you are absolute max ranges, far further than the dispell range).
---
So yeah can't really dispell the warriors if you are already feared. Another problem is that bosses do not attack feared targets. If the person with aggro becomes feared, then the boss will automatically target the player that is NOT feared with the highest amount of threat. This is REALLY bad actually, because every fear boss has a breath (at least the common ones, magmadar ony and nefarian), so if the boss suddenly targets someone in the raid, then does breath it's GG. This is actually quite the dilemma for horde guilds, because tremor totem doesn't prevent fears, so when the tank isn't able to berserker rage then you need the entire raid standing in range of the fear, and only the tank group use tremor, that way the tank keeps aggro the whole time. OF course the fury warriors can't use berserker in that fear :D
---
Okay lets read through it slowly?
---
All fears are raidwide yes?
---
You cannot dispell while feared yes?
---
Bosses will target players that are not feared yes?
---
This IS a dilemma for horde players yes? I mean if you have to consider what spec, what race, what tactics you do instead of spamming fear ward it is a dilemma right?
---
&gt; so when the tank isn't able to berserker rage
---
So if that isn't possible, then you have to resort to a shaman group tactic where everyone eats the fear. 
---
This does happen for guilds right?
---
Sparkshine
---
Just a thought but this may not even be present in Classic. I definitely wouldn't base a significant decision on whether it may be there or not.
---
Totally unforgiving.
---
I love it.
---
IIRC it actually stuck and you weren't able to unlearn it at all.
---
Anyway there's no point to leveling up engineering as gnomish and then dropping for goblin or opposite. You won't be able to gain anything from it.

Correcting grammar instead of following logic
---
Playing EvE Online
---
I don't believe so. I've played a lot of druid and have never found this to be the case.
---
When did I state that it did not? The only thing we have ever disagreed on was your original statement being incorrect. An undead warrior on horde side can be used to avoid all fears in a select few encounters. Is it mandatory? Of course it isn’t, but it is optimal for those encounters. 
---
Not saying anything about your grammar, I’m questioning I’m wondering if that was a question or a statement because it was worded like a statement but had a question mark following it.
---
There is no logic there to follow, I can’t answer your question because it makes no sense.
---
I never said you couldn't, I just explained that what happens if you don't.
---
Mana restoration adds .5 threat per point. Paladin healing adds .25 threat per point, and healing on all other classes adds .5 threat per point. I also think JoW procs apply threat to the toon who gets the proc, not to the judger. I think JoL proc threat goes to the judger, though.
---
Also I'm pretty sure JoW doesn't have a flat proc % but instead a PPM just like SoC and all weapon Chance on Hit and weapon enchant effects. Meaning, it's based on weapon speed.
---
If my previous point is correct this doesn't really matter for the math, but for my curiosity, how common is it to get a good weapon under 2.0 speed? Paladins don't have access to daggers, and I looked up a few iconic leveling swords and they're mostly above 2.0, and I remember maces typically being slow. Fist of Stone is a good example off the top of my head, though.
---
Also, as mentioned in another reply, global "friendly" threat generating mechanics like healing, mana Regen, Battle Shout, etc split the threat between all enemies on the threat table. "Hostile" threat generating effects like AoE damage and Demoralizing Shout apply the same amount to each target.
---
You wasted time explaining a moot point in a condescending manner. Fuck off.
---
Either way, NE doesn't have +5 bow skill (trolls do though). Only reason stat-wise to roll NE hunter over dwarf is that they get a miniscule amount of extra base agility at 60
---
WoW, looks great man! Keep the good job.
---
Can you link the spec(s)?
---
What? There are several recipes you can only make as one spec, but use as both. 
---
Shame Classic won't support 32bit :(
---
Well if you’re out of ideas I guess we are done here. Have a nice day!
---
Paladins generate half the healing threat of everyone else, so .25 per point. Factor in potential overhealing, and it's not likely to be a reliable source of threat. Cool little boost in certain cases, though.
---
I love the concept of that weapon, though. It would work better on a shaman because of more healing threat, or simply being able to instant cast a damage spell with it. But of course, tougher overall to tank with a shaman. I want to mess around with that weapon on a paladin or shaman come Classic though.
---
Then you're pretty fucking retarded. This dude's point isn't that hard to get.
---
HAvE a GoOd DaY 
---
I get his fucking point it’s just spastic

I feel like paladins are a pretty big factor in pvp to make ally more pvp.

Yea my friend, I said I am for #nochanges when it makes sense and I have proposed changes to vanilla as well on reddit, so I feel your debating someone that is definitely not me. The #nochange crowd can irk me sometimes, but I feel if we implement LFG for example, that many described as the start of the death of wow, than we are just being dimwitted. I mean after all, LFG came out at the end of wotlk in anyway, so just bring out all the other features and just leave it out at the last patch. I honestly don't think it was an integral part to wotlk.

Sure, actually being in holy or prot spec would make you better at those roles when in dungeons. But you're probably only going to run each dungeon 1-2 times while leveling and spend the other 90% of the time questing. So it's not worth it, you'll be able to do those roles just fine in dps spec assuming you collect the right gear. On my pally I kept a set of Int gear in my bags for dungeons but was ret spec.
---
Raiding Naxx on private server Lightbr*nger

Yes but you can buy them from a goblin/gnomish engineer instead of leveling twice. You CANNOT keep goblin only stuff like the teleporter etc. as a gnomish engi.

Yeah that’s something that is an unfortunate reality of 2019... they need to incentivize 2fa in one way or another to get a lot of people to actually use it.  I’d take 4 bag slots over who knows what other incentive, as cosmetic incentives generally don’t work for things like that — they need to be somewhat high impact to get people to go through the “hassle” of account security.  This was proven with their original design: it used to only be a core hound pup pet, but not enough people cared about pets for it to (in their eyes) make a big enough impact.  So if they don’t offer the bag space, it’ll be something else like a free mount at 40, or who knows what.

Problem is a lot of the good items work like this: 
---
You want to make and wear a level 25 item but the monsters that drop the mats are level 33. You end up out-leveling half the gear and by the time you can make it there’s something better from a quest or dungeon.
---
Yes there’s pebis lw items but you’ll be able to buy them. You’ll make a ton of cash if you go skinning and buy your devilsaur right at 60. 
---
why? pallys are garbage in pvp...
---
Rp will definitely be alliance, they have always loved that garbage 
---
Isn't the main benefit going the other way though? I thought most of the gadgets that gnomish makes can be used as goblin.  My current plan if my thoughts are correct is to level gnomish, make as many gadgets as I can keep and then unlearn/relearn with goblin.
---
My first time leveling a paladin was faster than all of my rogues (which were ALL horde).
---
Literally not being able to get experience when you're trying to level because every spawn in the zone is spawn camped and respawns every 5 minuts is not "legendary" in the slightest.
---
C&amp;D is only one of the many reasons why pservers may go south. If you take those as granted as retail servers you'll have an unpleasant surprise one day.
---
Personally I think the old graphics look better in most situations 
---
The items only require Engineering. You can absolutely level up one, craft all the BoP items, drop Engineering COMPLETELY, and re-level the profession from the beginning to go the other specialization. You now have a complete set of all BoP items both specializations can make. Expensive but useful.

Playing on the Warhammer Online server, Return of Reckoning. Much fun, much fun!

The latter. Drop it completely and start over from 1.

---
Ah okay, thanks
---
Ah the joys of low-manning Onyxia to get more bags. I swear those 5man kills were actually easier than the 40man ones. Worth it though, raiders need bag slots and kitting out your whole guild with full 18 slotters is a great feeling. 
---
Wrong, they made it very easy to kill the PvE bosses so it was more worth to just rush it than to take graveyards, since almost no one died.
---
Are shamans not a thing?

Everyone called Deadmines, DM. When Dire Maul was released it was refered to as DM North, DM East etc. Just DM, was still Deadmines.
---
That's how it was on 3 servers I played on (high pop servers) and all my friends refered to them this way on their servers.
---
I'm quite sure this is a fenomenon stirred up by new players that for some odd reason needs to lie that they played in classic for e-peen value, since a lot of new players call Deadmines VC.
---
wash me down the drain then :)
---
Yes, higher health regen and +spell power on low lvl greens as well. And they already said it's just "work in progress" since they haven't removed everything from the new engine yet.
---
You may be remembering the night elf passive "shadowmeld" which was a racial stealthing ability which only worked while remaining stationary
---
No pic no proof
---
lol... fake vanilla player detected
---
you got the two factions mixed up there.
---
Mechanical bugs.  
---
When I see a classic rogue guide recommending frontstabbing, I do this Jean-Luc Picard facepalm and mentally blacklist the "content creator" responsible.  
---
I've heard classic wow is extremely demanding so this is probably wise... 
---
Quitting your job is a terrible idea. 
---
Paladins are vastly superior to shamans in PvP healing.
---
Paladins are way better than shamans for pvp healing.
---
Except it wasn't a joke cause I can see you arguing with him in the thread.
---
Players wanting to implement certain features without the foresight to understand how those changes will impact the game is not the same as wanting a specific state of the game.
---
Yeah... I went from being straight up addicted to wow since vanilla to quitting the game within 3 days of the cataclysm prepatch. Holy power was a mistake 
---
Was this a thing? 
---
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!
---
I don't see why you'd go LW without also going skinning. If you do LW then do pick up skinning.
---
That aside, the main benefit is armour patches, potential early shoulders/helm, berserker bracers at level 35ish (iirc) and obviously devilsaur. Other than that I hate to say it but LW is kinda pitiful. 
---
ja, heil.
---
 I played on Aszune-EU, I never saw anyone calling it VC.
---
All the good stuff is BoP though
---
I want the best WoW experience that they can offer. The less they change, the less chance they have of fucking up something for the worse.  
---
If I wanted enthusiatic experimentation, then I could play retail.  
---
Sorry for the deontological adherence to a "no change" policy, but I don't trust a system that tries to "make it slightly better" given it's track record.
---
Woldn't it be also BIS for prot palas? Seals could proc Ironfoe and vice versa.

&gt;I've lived in four continents, worked in war zones and office parks
---
I just dreamed about going to Antarctica with my laptop, and logging in to WoW Classic from there, only because back then, someone actually logged in from there, even though 800ms would be the optimistic case...
---
The Classic playerbase deserve and should have the option of eternal vanilla servers. As populations naturally fall populations will have to be maintained with mergers or suffer dead servers.
---
I'd love to see a TBC:Classic and would expect to see the option to transfer your level 58+ character to a TBC server to carry on progress that way.
---
In three or so years time I'll not be playing classic vanilla; if there's TBC I will migrate, if there isn't I will unsub. So the populations of servers will change over time regardless of TBC - they either wither as the server ages or they split when TBC releases. And either way the dead servers are revived with merges.
---
&gt;to leave the game fully your character must also perish. 
---
or go beyond patch 3.3.5a
---
I'm pretty happy with 1.12 version of AV. 
---
Wait, vanilla wasn't always the "default" flavor?
---
Yeah this is what I was thinking as well.
---
Yep. People competed to low man it, EJ did it with three people in Naxx gear. Also helped get more scales for cloaks early.
---
The \[PlayMusic\] api call already overwrites the current music channel. So you can call it to play the song you want and it'll overwrite the current zone music.   
---
\[PlayMusic\]: [https://wow.gamepedia.com/API\_PlayMusic](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_PlayMusic)
---
Yep. Lot harder to kill as well.  Lucky most Alliance pallys PvP as ret.
---
If you'd waited for Cata to release you would've quit anyway because it was shit.
---
Im fine with that. If we have no namechanges or server changes the playerbase can just remember the name and blacklist then for future raids.
---
There was also right-click report and modern bnet features.
---
It's not safe to assume they will remove any of these.
---
Wtf is that low res chest model?
---
Nope, it's an entirely different set of graphics. 
---
Except no. Blizzard won't be selling gear for money under the table or things like that. They won't do *in game* shady stuff. If the company does shady stuff with taxes or whatever that's not really relevant to me. Now you are just hating on ActiBlizz just to hate.
---
&gt; I don't know why private server players expect the server owners to be a bunch of angels.
---
Then maybe stop talking about this when you have no clue. The reason is that when pservers start to sell gear and instant lvl 60 it ruins the experience for other people at the server. The fact that they try to hide it clearly shows they even know it's shady themselves.
---
And yes, it's their project, they can do what they want - *except*  most pservers start out with promising *not* to do it and collect donations based on that. People actually pay them based on promises they then later break. 
---
&gt; Were RPPVP servers that unbalanced
---
Very unbalanced.  Alliance RP has about 10x the players.
---
You mean roll playing in a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
---
No, I mean role playing in a role playing game 
---
You mean, the mobs of outlands couldn't be scaled up requiring you to have 60 gear to get better 60 gear..? 
---
You can find forum posts that say the earth is flat, it does not make it true. There are always some people that will hate on a bit of the game but I loved AV as it was and I loved the blend of PvE and PvP in one battleground. I know I was not alone in that opinion and that before Battle groups, Al'akir - EU had some amazing AV battles (mainly as the horde were better on the server but alliance had the bridge to even it out.) 
---
You must know that you were wrong, considering you try to ignore the most important part of my post. You just mention duels, but I also talk about wPvP.
---
It's not uncommon to level up a character for wPvP.
---
And no need to hit me up, I don't plan to play druid this time. Done balance druid twice in vanilla *for wPvP*. Once was during vanilla.
---
And the whole point of your post is basically you trying to insult anyone that finds fun in WoW in a different way than you. That's just pathetic.
---
Thought you couldn't loot chests in combat?
---
yup. thats me
---

It's fun to see how different people experience WoW - no wonder it's hard to please everyone.
---
Personally I'd go way different about it. Panda is the xpac I liked the least along with WoD. Both were because I didn't like the story / theme. To me they were not the WoW lore I know and love.
---
Vanilla, TBC and WotLK on the other hand were my favourites since it's what has that Warcraft feeling to me.
---
Cata I'd put inbetween actually. I didn't find it to be that big of a shitshow, but to be fair I only played PvP in that xpac and I felt like the class design was fun.
---
Legion I'm quite mixed about. The story*telling* was great, but I didn't care for the story. Illidan's Rejection of the Gift was a great cutscene as an example, but overall I hated how you, the player, are suddenly a big famous hero and saviour of the world. And I hated how the mystery of the world got removed. Everything had to be explained. 
---
Which leads to why I somewhat like BfA - or more precisely, why I think I *will* like it in the future. Is the story a shitshow? Yes. But looking at whats to come it seems like the mystery is back. I honestly believe the Old God storyline will be amazing. And not only that, it is a theme I like in WoW. Not chinese pandas, but proper WoW lore to me.
---
yikes
---
I started playing on a presumably not to be named private classic server. It's great fun and I know I'm going to love playing real classic again now. Always in the back of my mind I know it's pointless though because I'm going to play official when it releases so it seems like its going to be a lot of work for nothing and also its unofficial which somehow de-legitimises it in my mind. 
---
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
---
poggers in chat
---
You'd get a Gnomish Death Ray, a pet, a low level trinket and low level goggles. Everything else is BOE or needs Gnomish Engineering to use.
---
nice binds
---
Just in case you actually plan to play like this, Classic won't support 32 bit. So either install windows 64 bit or use a new computer with the old monitor.
---
Yeah, you're right on that. I guess it just comes down to a much nicer UI/UX having it in the format the OP presented. Also, I think the OP's design had potentially more information than the spreadsheet/s on https://legacy-wow.com/tbc-pre-raid-gear-list/ as the OPs had the item source, too.
---
Wouldn't be mad if there are new servers honestly. I can see how it would be beneficial to the emulation scene to have an archetype to data mine and recreate just in case something does/doesn't happen to the retail classic servers. I'm hoping classic stays for a long time, but something like progressing to TBC would mean classic has to be preserved once again in emulated servers.
---
I don't have much trust in the gaming industry, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gather as much data as we can in case we see major change.

currently playing on a private server. just wanted to have a short look before summer. now i am lvl 27 on my rogue and heading towards ravenholdt
---
Classic / Changes
---
Pick one.
---
A buddy and I leveled on private servers back in 2016, I can't remember exactly how far we got but we put in a decent amount of time.
---
Eventually the server got shut down, that was pretty much the nail in the coffin for me as far as private servers go.
---
I couldn't rationalize putting effort into a private server character again knowing I could lose it at a moments notice.
---
Thats pretty much the biggest reason I am excited for Classic, knowing that it will be there for me at all times. I won't necessarily have to level as fast as possible, I can take my time and even take breaks if I get burnt out but my character will always be there no matter what.
---
It won't be a waste of my time.
---
This is what a huge amount of people are wondering about. It should NOT lag at all but we'll only know once we get to test these things. No other answer can be given.
---
&gt;Any reason why you didn't just unsubscribe? Where you afraid to fall back into the adiction?
---
As others have mentioned, I was thoroughly addicted and an executive decision needed to be made. I had already attempted to 'slow down' with regards to WoW, but every restriction I established was soon ignored, every moratorium was cancelled, and all my promises to myself were broken. 
---
I'm someone who has a tendency to use maximalist, all-or-nothing thinking. So eventually, deleting my character appeared to be the only viable self-control measure. 
---
Of course Activision Blizzard will give better funding support and better server infrastructure to Classic WoW than it does to its flagship MMO product. /s
---
The Blizz fanboys will never admit this is an issue, but BfA can barely support much, much smaller amounts of people in the same place than we will see semi regularly in Vanilla WoW, which private servers run out of Russian basements handle easily.
---
Either we will see the same quality we do in BfA (you really expect *better?*) or there will be sharding to discourage this sort of "behavior."
---
More likely than not, it will just be a terribly laggy experience *just like retail.*
---
You really think they're going to give *more funds and support* to Classic than they do to BfA?
---
Max zoom, use +/- to alter it, never felt the need to change it.
---
For abilities I use 1 2 3 4 5 q e r f z X c v s plus shift modifiers on all those. Mouse wheel for lazy shit like mob tagging with a macro and instant cast spell.
---
Rebind a and d to strafe, there is no need to keyboard turn. I also found minimal use for s, back peddling was just something I stopped doing I found another use for the key a long time ago.
---
Paladins are more straight forward and safer. They lean more towards being pure and efficient healers, similar to their raiding role. Additionally they bring in very strong protection spells for themselves and for their allies. Dwarves bring in a really good PvP racials that makes the sturdy Pallies even more sturdy.
---
Shamans are typically caster/healer hybrids in PvP who can bring down serious amounts of AoE burst damage from range because of their naturally high spellcrit chance and damage. Their totems are generally more impactful and flexible than auras but also stationary and vulnerable. Also shamans have the additional benefit of being able to roll as Orc or Tauren who have uncontested top PvP racials.
---
Both melee dps versions (ret pally, enh shaman) are more gear dependand than their healing counterparts, but have some serious burst damage. But in the end they are both more gimmicky versions of the more versataile and mobile arms warrios.
---
So you could say that Paladins bring in more consistency and safety to their groups while Shamans are more volatile/inconsitent but also have higher highs.
---
No, you mean a core concept of the game is garbage which means you're lost sir.
---
No I don’t 
---
Agree with everything.
---
All of my friends have said the same. 
---
Allegedly, every expansion following Wrath has been incrementally more disappointing. It appears as though, either Blizzard forgot why World of Warcraft was such a large social phenomenon, or the original developers moved away and took their institutional knowledge with them. 
---
In any event, it appears as though I unwittingly bailed out before the proverbial plane flew into the mountain. I consider myself lucky, as my fond memories of Vanilla were never blemished by the disappointments of subsequent expansions. 
---
Undead rogue, check
---
No keybind, check
---
Typical Horde player
---
thought the same. just wanted to have a look on a private server. now i am lvl 27 and having so much fun. the only result for classic will be that i will level much faster, cause it seems i forgot a TON of stuff from 10 years ago. just did 5 wsg yesterday. lost all, but having sooo much fun.
---
All three of you are correct! 
---
In my original comment, I ballparked my /played and estimated it was in the high hundreds (800-900 days). In retrospect, and thinking about it seriously, you're right, my account /played would likely be in the low thousands, if anything. 
---
Waiting for Anno 1800 to play until lauch
---
You should read the crap you type then.

Playing minecraft. I wanted something with some depth. 
---
I did.

r/woooosh

Soon enough, brother! Come Classic's launch, you'll find me at Tarren Mills, sharing my love of edged swords with low-level Alliance  ;) 
---
Spyro? Lets be real, that shit was bad ass.
---
I get that, but still. I would and have kept my chars 
---
Samus main from day one. I suck but it's great fun.
---
!remindme 1month
---
And you're stance is still to protend you didn't make a stupid comment?
---
Thank you very much for the intel! 
---
I literally have not logged into my Blizzard / [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) account in a decade. I wasn't aware of (nor was I curious about) the new quality-of-life features that have since been introduced into the game. 
---
While the idea of reviving a 10-year-old character sounds appealing, I will probably roll an entirely new character when Classic is launched. To me, the process of leveling is central to the true Vanilla experience, so I wouldn't want to log-in immediately to a capped-out character. 
---
Thanks, again, nevertheless! 
---
Theorycrafting with mates that have come back to wow for classic. We talk every day working out classes, routes we will take.... but we always change what we want to play after reading some thread or watching some video so we just keep going back to “what are you going to play?” “Don’t roll on my loot dude”
---
The usual basically 
---
What is protend? 
---
I don't think you understand. This is the only way to get rid of gold selling and it works perfectly: there are literally no gold sellers on pserver I play on (and so also no farmers) it's beautiful and better than vanilla ever was. 
---
If there was a way to appeal your ban (it ust be impossible because you cannot prove that you didn't buy the gold), it would be useless in preventing gold selling and the game would be ruined.
---
This is a huge problem indeed. Same thing happens in the 40v40 tarren mill vs southsore brawl. 
---
Idk why Blizzard are slacking on so much on server stuff. Wasn't always like this..
---
Why do you comment on something you don’t know anything about?
---
It looks pretty stupid. Please don’t do that.
---
protend. Verb. (third-person singular simple present protends, present participleprotending, simple past and past participleprotended) (obsolete) To hold out; to stretch forth.
---
I don't want to make my own thread but names for a male orc warrior? RP names and meme names like Smorc welcome.
---
I plan on returning, yes, as soon as Classic WoW is released. 
---
I won't make any attempts to revive or restore my character, however. As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, I believe that the levelling process is central to one's experience of Vanilla. The slow, brutal grind to max level--and all the exploration, socializing and idling which it entails--is the best part of the game, as far as I'm concerned! 
---
Lol 
---
Reading through all this story I can't keep from wondering how much of this is bullshit.  
---
1. You got ganked, but killed both of them, but still have all your CDs up. Aight, you might've taken a screenshot later. 
---
2. It's a level 25ish zone so I wonder, what is their level (gnome looks like 30ish judging from his gear) and why in the world would they attack a guy 10ish levels higher?
---
3. It brings a third question, why did you wait for them to respawn if you had no motivation in fighting (they attacked first, duh)?
---
While none of your story makes sense and given your race/class combo, the potential answer is self-evident: you were having fun chain-killing lowbies.
---
I have one question though: why in the world are you humlebragging here about it while also lying about being the victim?
---
I hope for the original old School AV. I remember on private servers people would get pissed if someone started defending because they wanted their rewards ASAP. I think we will see this mentalitets in classic, too, but there will definitely also players who enjoy the long fought battles.
---
I would guess the conflict is highest during AV weekends where some want to optimisme their time in AV and some want to chill.
---
I see! Was it normal to sell accounts in Wotlk? When I quit vanilla I sold my lvl 60 hunter with MC/BWL gear for about $300.
---
You activated my trap card.
---
It's not the client man,it's their shitty servers. I remember the huge fights in WoD in Ashran without any lag. Now in BfA the servers will lag even in a small 20v20 fight. It's a fucking shame and Blizzard is STILL doing nothing about it.
---
Homo 
---
I Think LFG should work the way custom LFG works today, meaning it shouldn't be automated, but we should have a way of listing our groups without having to spam trade chat.
---
Technically the truth.
---
I can tell, and not in the sexual way. 
---
My Paladin who I play in the same time frame had ~150days, I'm quite sure you are still underestimating it 🙄
---
So what’s the play here? What items other than the death ray are actually worth levelling Gnome for?
---
What are the ways someone could tell?
---
I'd say more Horde on PvP since PvP will be the go to servers for most competitive hardcore players and those tend to be horde.
---
Rp servers are definetely going to be domiinated by alliance since most rpers are on the alliance.
---
RpPvP is also going to be more Alliance heavy but the difference won't be as big as on Rp servers.
---
PvE servers should be pretty even I think, since being in the minority here isn't that big of a problem as on PvP servers.
---
tldr
---
PvP: Horde dominated
---
Rp: Alliance dominated
---
RpPvP: Alliance dominated but smaller difference
---
PvE: even
---
God I really fucking hate the Blizzard fanboys,they can't accept that their game is in a bad state right now and whenever you say something bad about the game then they'll flame you and defend the game and I think that's the reason why Blizzard sucks nowadays.
---
 Just go on their fucking Reddit or WoW forum and make a discussion about how bad the servers are and you'll get flamed like shit.
---
death to Gnomes.
---
It was definetly the best of modern WoW, it had some really amazing stuff, but in the end its still modern WoW.
---
Correct. I am almost certainly underestimating it. Perhaps, a part of me doesn't want to face the grim reality that I spent more than 1,000 days in-game. 
---
Probably because this discussion has been had quite a few times on this sub.
---
I paid everyone in the group 1g to let me have it and it was by far the best gold ever spent. I would park by the mail box in Ironforge activate the piccolo and go AFK. Come back to so much hate mail. 
---
I think you were the one wooshed.
---
You fool, don't let them know. 
---
polski, easily
---
Which version of AV was in 1.12, was it the one with the reinforcement countdown or the one where you could play all night, go to bed and go to work the next day, then get home to join the same AV?
---
&gt; I have one question though: why in the world are you humlebragging here about it while also lying about being the victim?
---
Because internet points and e-peen!
---
#i've..... become soOo numb 
---
Players want a good game. Vanilla was a good game. So they want to play vanilla. Players however lack the deep understanding and knowledge to design a game (which is why it is a separate profession in the first place) and thus can't decide WHY it was a good game, and what kind of changes would improve on it. 
---
Yeah, for sure! I don't even plan to get born until release!
---
No. Imo there should be no reward for PvP because the moment you introduce rewards the whole system gets gamed and exploited.
---
Gameplay-wise you want long, even, fair fights between players. The moment you introduce any kind of reward you actually punish those who get into these even and fair fights.
---
Zin'Malor
---
A bit late?
---
It's generally agreed upon by PvP:ers that paladins are just straight up better.
---
Shaman totems have only 20 yards range unless you have 3pc T1 while paladin blessings are just a straight up buff to place on people. All the paladin blessing are also better than their shaman counterparts. One paladin can also buff an entire raid, with different buffs for each class.
---
As for utility it kinda comes down to Blessing of freedom, Blessing of protection, Blessing of sacrifice, Bubble, Cleanse vs Earthshock, Windfury, Purge and tremor(i'm probably forgetting something for both classes here) Where anyone can "dispell" tremor and windfury by simply killing the totems, the totems also have as mentioned very limited range and are stationary.
---
In PvP i'd also rate defensive dispell over offensive dispell because you can keep CC of your teammates which is huge. Paladins also wear plate vs shamans mail which means more dmg reduction and also more gear available.
---
And there's no contest that paladins are infintely harder to kill than shamans + they have 2 ways to break CC's on themselves, 3 if you add BoP for stuff like blind and sap.
---
Paladins are also more mana efficient and straight up better healers. Not to mention you have a tanky class that's hard to kill with dispell, horde only has priests for dispell. Weighing all of this vs shamans having better racials and can do some more dmg there's no contest imo which class is better.
---
Slow? Downtime? Threat capping dps? No idea what you are talking about.
---

Old AV was just way too long. That's why they nerfed it primarily. PvP shouldn't be a grind, we already have farming and raiding for that.

It's not that the expansions were bad, the whole system is awful. Making all previous content irrelevant with each new release is not a good model. They should've sticked to lvl 60 as the cap and focus more on  horizontal progression. 
---
You are correct:
---
 **Gutrot is troll warrior from the Aerie Peak EU server who levelled continuously from 1-70 without the use of weapons or armour.** 
---
Say 4 or 5 extra server side actions happen per person nowadays. Multiply that by 80 and that can cause delays that just wouldn’t happen with simpler abilities and calculations. 
---
I’m not saying there shouldn’t be concern but I guarantee you classic wouldn’t lag this bad. 
---
Depending on how classic handles addons this should be more than possible.  There are addons that help track farming for live right now.
---
some catch up mechanics are fine, like in vanilla. but giving raid level gear for doing solo and pug content is a  joke.
---
Honestly, this is my experience as well. In games like Overwatch I \*hate\* teenagers and kids because they are toxic in voice chat, but in WoW it's different to me. I don't see many young kids being toxic, more often they are just friendly and enjoying the game. The older generation on the other hand tends to be the toxicity. 
---
At least that's my experience.

Honestly, it would be amazing to see the Dalarna mages riding around on dalahästar.
---
&gt; thankfully Blizz ruined ~~paladins~~ the game
---
FTFY
---
If there was a good time to check back with retail wow, it was Legion, not Bfa. Just wait for classic.
---
Well if it pulls more players than bfa of course they will. We will have to wait and see.
---
Playing magic arena. It's gonna be the next big thing once they finish their mobile app if you're into tcgs check it out
---
in the countries where the servers are mostly hosted you can take that C&amp;D and crumple it up and throw it in the garbage 
---
I'm pretty sure Blood Elves joining the horde was foreshadowed back in TFT. It's not something they pulled out of their ass just to balance the game.
---
This doesn't change anything about the fact that innocent players got banned. I think you don't understand.
---
can confirm that. plus while currently leveling (lvl 27) i did many dungeons and also had very nice and chill mates. not those type of rushing gogogo min maxers many here are talking about. many of them are like me and havent played the game for 10 years and just cant wait for summer or just want to get into it a bit.
---
No they were not unbalanced. I played on Emerald Dream from day 1 of server launch as Horde. The RPPVP servers seem to have none of the balance issues the RPPVE servers had.
---
ya i already saw like 5 videos on youtube about this post :D
---
Not a european thing either. Very rarely seen anyone even mention VC regarding DM.
---
Old AV was basically just Southshore v Tarren Mill all over again.  You even have the NPC guards that keep the peace.  I honestly didn't mind it at all but I can see why some people didnt like it.
---
The issue is in their coding. The game is 15 years old and has only received one major rewrite all the way back in cataclysm. It's time for a new engine. At this point the spaghetti code is so thick they probably can't fix it. Keep in mind it took how many years to add extra backpack slots?
---
I want working summoning stones tho 
---
I highly doubt there will be big battles between Southshore and Tarren's Mill. For the same reason there will be no true vanilla experience. The mindset of people has changed completely. In retail vanilla most people played for fun. Those battles were just amazing. Nowadays people play for rewards. Why have big 40vs40 battles in Alterac Valley if you can just PvE rush down the bosses and ignore the other faction?
---
50/50 seems right. It was more like 60/40 for alliance in vanilla, but i have a feeling it will be more balanced this time. I for one plan on going Horde, even tho i'm traditionally an ally.
---
people raid for gear 
---
people PvP for gear
---
next question? 
---
More like talking from experience. It's like knowing you took a beating 5-6 times already and you would still give it a go, no thanks.
---
Some administrative and great additions should remain like right click report  and of course Bnet features will stay.  What they're trying to do is making sure the gameplay is the same.
---
In private servers this is done purely because of weapon drops. Bags and T2's are just a bonus. Would be great to fit your whole bank with 18 slotters in classic. I dont understand how warriors can carry all their gear and consumables in example AQ....
---
It started out as a joke then mindless reddit hive mind triggered me.
---
Yeah, putting "just get TF" in there isnt going to be possible for all. 
---
And a pre-bis stage and put top 2-3 per itemslots + like top 5 weapons.
---
I have other reasons as well. I would quit it right now but I'm delaying it for a while. 
---
You are prepared!
---
Bro the VC dilemma started in vanilla 
---
Blizzard has never released a classic server before. Except in the HD remake of SC they have never intentionally tried to being back their  players' old experiences. 
---
With WoW they always thought they were releasing a newer version with revamped systems ("improved").
---
This is the first time we're in this situation, not the 5th or 6th. It's also a new team, separate from the "current wow" team.
---
Would like to know more about that tanking priest
---
Literally said this to my gf a few hours ago
---
Carrot on a stick 
---
It's not like you're going to interact with 95% of those 1000 in a zone. What you'll notice mainly is lack of mobs everywhere.
---
Nope, picked mage and sticked by it.
---
You need to see the fraps logo 
---
i would suggest a healer or mage. (range class in gerenall, but more mage instead of hunger / wl cause no pet control needed)
---
Source?
---
BeerMePlz offered good answer, I'll just say that for making gold you can party with a healer and duo farm DM
---
I dont get how blizz works. This was their most profitable year. You would think they upgrade servers but I would say they sold some servers and crammed the realms on other remaining ones. Since a lot of players left they don't see the point to maintain servers with minimal load. 
---
It's not a fallacy if it's true
---
Painting minifigures from games workshop etc in warcraft themes! 
---
Get back to me when you have a way to completely get rid of gold selling that has better drawbacks.
---
This is one of the reasons I love wPvP - no real objective aside from cleaning up *insert faction* scum.
---
People who want changes from vanilla are dumb
---
Rogue and Mage. I love rogue because the class has a "fast and fluid playstyle" and many options to elevate yourself from the average rogue by learning how to vanish death coils, goblin helmet, pom pyros, but also by blinding nature's swiftness and generally timing your abilities correctly. Mage is a close second because in my opinion it's the best class overall. Hitting Frostbolt+CoC shatter combo on frozen targets is damn satisfying and the class got so much cc, utility and mobility. After playing rogue and mage I cannot play classes with shitty mobility, like locks or priests. It's just too slow and boring.
---
Mage is imo the best class OVERALL in Vanilla. Overall means PvE, PvP, Utility, Farming Potential and FUN. Mages are a top DPS class for PvE, they are one of the best PvP classes, they are one of the best classes to farm gold, they lvl fast and they are just fun to play. 
---
The truth is that nobody really knows yet how a detail like this is going to be handled. You might have to unlearn or you might be stuck or you might be able to use the book in steamwheedle port but nobody knows for sure yet.
---
The problem is those lag issues in BfA are caused by the combination of sharding, CRZ and dynamic mob scaling constantly changing based on players in group.
---
This most likely won't be nearly as bad in Classic because of the absence of such systems except sharding. In Classic the servers don't have to connect to other realms or phases constantly so that alone will help.
---
Cut costs (features and services) and increase profit drivers (microtransactions).
---
Activision Blizzard is behaving like a profit driven company and not like "games by gamers for gamers" like the ghost of old Blizzard.
---
RIGHT???
---
Very disappointed.  That's $5,200 in BFA xpac purchases and subscription payments between those players and they can't even participate in a reasonable community event.
---
Gameplay will absolutely be the same when a lvl 60 ganking lowbies in STV gets mass right click reported and booted into the login screen with an auto-ban.
---
Well, you CAN do DME lashers solo, even in full holy spec. DME jump bossruns with a warrior is simple enough to do. 
---
Other than that you really cant kill shit. Its bad enough if you do herbs, getting aggro of anything ... jeesus.
---
None, but goblin engi doesn't even have the death ray
---
Im more hoping for a test realm. Where everyone gets trown into a zone starting at a certain level.
---
Give people some gear and levels and drop then infront on a dungeons for testing.
---
Having everyone at lv 1 could be worth testing since they will have sharding at start.
---
I'm not saying that one version of AV was better than another. I'm simply pointing out that Blizzard changed AV in response to player feedback. Players overall just didn't like it. Sure there were some who did (like I said I never really got involved in PvP back then so I have no opinion aside from finding the idea of a PvPvE battleground interesting) but the overall reaction from the PvP community was negative. 
---
These chumps are the ones lining the pockets of Activision Blizzard execs.
---
Activision Blizzard really cultivated their perfect crop of little cash machines.
---
Now they're hoping to reap a bit of the old guard and get our money too.
---
Did you find the constant drinking to be a pain in the ass? When I tried an instant 60 private server, every time I died, I would buff arcane intellect, dampen magic and use mage or frost armour, this would leave me with most of my mana drained and I’d have to drink whilst everyone else goes off on their mounts and gets into the action 
---
I just saw the post of the guy who reached 10k hours on the same character... ouch!
---
But Blizzard has access to the raw numbers. John Staats straight up said that old AV wasn't popular with the players, specifically because of the mix of PvP and PvE. Now a vocal minority shouting on the forums is one thing, but if the silent majority really liked AV, then it should have been very popular, and Blizzard would have seen that in the numbers. The fact that they went ahead and removed almost all the PvE elements strongly suggests that the silent majority were in Warsong Gulch instead. 
---
The rule of thumb here is goblin can do sapper charges, while sacrificing few fun/semi-useful gadgets. Sappers can get you some decent profit though, especially now with a lot of people min maxing.
---
pretty much perfect summory of why loot trading is bad.
---
We know for sure because we know how it was in vanilla. They are recreating the experience, not making up some mechanics.
---
There won't be phasing, cross realm zones and dynamic mob scaling. That alone should help with lag issues since the servers don't have to connect to other services and servers constantly.
---
Retail is a clusterfuck of micro services.
---
The only change I want... Is to be able to auto loot without having to hold shift or use an addon. Also area loot would be nice, but I get it. That's it. 
---
Killmaim, guys please buy it from me it wont sell i need money oh shit oh fk
---
Haven’t played since WoD but this seems like the dudes latency (I sure hope). I remember doing wintergrasp and there was barely any hiccups
---
Every class that has mana needs to drink after re-buffing, the only difference is that as a mage you can conjure your own water for free. If constant drinking bothers you, don't even try playing a priest, it's far worse plus you have to beg for water.
---
I dunno, after reading the Compendiums I just can't really reconcile the idea of the Blood Elves joining up with a faction containing Trolls. There's some serious amounts of racial conflict there going back a long time. Don't even get me started on the idea of the Blood Elves being cool with joining the Zandalar. 
---
Removed due to being a repost.
---
damn, i guess i'll try that!
---
your keybinds are fucked
---
Alright thanks.  I think I will main Mage, even if I find out to not enjoy the class as I would have hoped. At least I’ll have a solid gold farmer and I can use that gold to twink out a warrior or a rogue to make levelling easier for myself.
---
Blacksmiths get a 30 seconds fear immunity trinket at around 235 skill. Enchanters can make an armor/resist trinket that's bad for everyone except feral tanks. Casters can make preraid bis robes with tailoring but can unlearn tailoring afterwards.
---
Overall the benefits of most professions are small except for engineering.
---
Is death ray used on every class? I’m gonna play a mage
---
If you prefer rogue you can pickpocket BRD and mine ores for gold, it's not too bad. In the end I wouldn't make gold farming potential a major criteria for choosing your main class but rather what you really enjoy playing.
---
59 twinking. Its a helluva lot more fun than 120 + playing vs other twinks is so much fun
---
Or learn engineering/blacksmithing for  ultimate fear immunity from berserker rage+deathwish+berserker rage+glimmering mithril insignia + berserker rage (+recklessness  +undead but nobody likes those).
---
OMFG, clicking, Linkin Park, backpeddeling; THIS IS EVERYTHING!

The thing is I don’t have a lot of experience at end game 60 mage. I’ve tried retro out but I’m not getting a realistic experience as there are balance Druids running around with Atiesh fucking everyone up.  
---
From PvP vids that I’ve seen online I like how mage is able to handle themselves in almost all situations. Even managing to turn the tides in unfavourable 1v 2 or even 1v 3 with the clever use of engineering.    Rogue was my second choice but I’m worried that In BGs there’s gonna be a lot of waiting around and boring defending roles. 
---
I’m more of a guy that likes to get stuck into the action and can do decent amounts of damage. 
---
Hi, /u/Garkash94
---
I’d say this is a stretch, maybe in pure healing output.. but they’re both pretty rounded considering shaman has a crazy nice toolkit. (Also assuming pala isn’t wearing full plate but I didn’t play ally but I’m almost 1000% they wore some cloth). Shamans can be tricky to kill also as they have a nice kit. 
---
Get zug zugged scrub
---
What?  They took the PvE element out of AV?  What is this blasphemy?
---
Retro is actually good to see how classes do with end game gear, but if you don't have the time or money to gear up there it sucks. Based on what you have written:
---
Correct, mages can easily win 1vX with sheep, iceblocks, aoe dmg and engineering. You can either easily escape sticky situations or you can turn them around. Rogue in BGs requires a lot of skill and a lot of waiting in stealth and as you have said, you prefer to be in the middle of action. As a mage you can jump 1v10 at the start of wsg with nova, coc, blastwave and deal massive dmg.
---
Being able to wear a full tier set is one of the points why I will play Hunter and my second choice being a rogue \^\^
---
"Whining: stop whining" - whine
---
Engineering is by far the cheapest crafting profession to relevel. On pservers with similar economy of retail vanilla, you pay about 90g. 
---
Besides be lucky that you can reskill at all. Once locked in, blacksmithing like armor/axe/mace etc. cant be reverted, not even by reskilling.
---
Looking at guilds,
---
Raid times: maybe a couple days during the week, would prefer more Friday-evening/Saturday-afternoon or evening/Sunday-afternoon. 7 pm - 10:00/30 pm weekdays. Central US time.
---
As melee battle chicken is really, really good. Have all 5 of your group go battlechicken and you have 25mins of +5% swing increase. It has a 30min timer, so you can have the buff almost always.
---
Whatever koolaid is giving people like you this optimism, pass some over.
---
"I'll believe it when I see it"
---
Here's hoping for the best.
---
Good luck gearing that up with actual endgame gear haha
---
See, I feel this backs me actually, the certainty of your server and character largely depends on where you live/play.
---
And again, c&amp;d is just 1 thing out of many.
---
A defensive purge is better - ya ok bye buffs. Get holy locked and die. Sure you have more healing output, but when they aren’t healing they have their thumbs stuck up their ass cause they can’t assist in PvP otherwise. 
---

Paying about 80g for two very strong PvP and PvE trinkets is quite a good price.
---
One thing a lot of people don't realize is that all of the new spells, mainly procs, in this scale of a battle take a massive toll on the servers.  Some games counter this with a thing called time dilation, or tidi (see EVE Online), which essentially is controlled lag that slows everyone in the area down, resulting in fewer needed computations per tick.  Obviously this doesn't work in WoW, so they are kind of stuck in a hard place when it comes to large scale battles.  The more hits, procs, heals (think of all the AoE heals there are now compared to Vanilla), etc. that you have, the more computations per server tick the hardware needs to compute, which results in laggy/stuttering servers.
---
The nice thing about Vanilla is there is **far** less in terms of hits and procs.  
---
Another good thing on the user's end is there are far, far less spell particles than there are in current release WoW.
---
Is this on retail? Didn't realise the twinkling world was still alive!
---
Horde offered help right? Same thing as why we have the crack head elfs now? 
---
Oh cool! Would love to see some pictures. 
---
They need to fix their borked up matching system first!
---
Plenty of people have done that. It doesn’t require luck, you probably just suck if it’s so hard for you.
---
If the priest needs a DPS chest its called ninja. And you can call them out on it. If the servers are in the 2-4k population range, and you think ruining your and your guild reputation for a 5man instance drop is worth it... You can be sure this subreddit will have a LOT of "xxx is a ninja" posts. 
---
yes I can agree
---
Haha sounds fun. I have no idea what is the best way to level, I just followed the quests in the past.
---
The extra backpack slots are actually just a hidden 4 slot bag.
---
Just give paladins a taunt! 
---
Hell yeah it was! Apart from those little egg dudes. Fuck those guys.

I see what you did there!

Am I wrong or did using this cancel eating?

I remember our RL losing his shit one night when someone used it while he eating for his food buff from chimaerok chops. 
---
Oh so you're the smell.....
---
Poor monkey.
---
For me, I used to use /train in raids during downtime. I suppose its a byproduct of being a lighthearted person, but I always found it hilarious that the raid leader would start talking on vent/discord and in the background you could faintly hear the choo choooooo
---
Alright, I’m definitely going mage then. Thanks for replying 
---
Id say the list you made depends HUGELY if theres patch item progression.

I'd advise against quitting unless you have another job lined up. Would totally book holiday off though when the date is out!

Whats the guild you're making and on na or EU?
---
Here's an education lesson in private server endgame gear dynamics. 
---
You won't be taken to a raid as a *balance* druid.
---
By the time the raid is on farm you might get invited, but you still won't get preference for gear drops that other specs can use more effectively than you.
---
Long after Naxx's release, you'll finally be able to consistently get endgame gear that's worth a damn.
---
So good luck gearing while the game is still relevant!
---
Well, you have a few choices, Orc hunter, Tauren hunter, Troll hunter or if you like alliance, Dwarf hunter, NE hunter, Human Hunter.
---
you still need a bed pan besides your computer.
---
 the arrows from  the gelkis/magram clan are very strong  in lvl 19 twink PvP ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=3464](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3464)). 
---
 they give a 9.5DPS increase while  the normal arrows only give 3.5DPS. 
---
Seeing how Venomstrike or Lil Timmys only have \~11DPS, this DPS increase is quite good.
---
Well it won't take you that long. Going to be pretty bored until classic!
---
I would want a fresh 2.0 client, start in vanilla work your way through TBC, keeps the new kids on the block from having to level solo through old content.
---
Leaving the old servers alone so that people can still play vanilla if they want.
---
What are you studying? Any links to the videos you enjoyed? I always need more to watch!
---
My Celeron D couldn't even do that.
---
It crits pretty high, it's fun to use on any class. Mages have lots of opportunities to use it safely so yeah, works pretty well
---
8/8 t1 is nice to have on vael aoe spam early on.
---
I can understand the desire to use sharding early on, but having a Classic players first impression of the game include sharding would be a giant fail.
---
Then we'll have to see once classic hits how it really was in vanilla. There is quite a bit of disagreement over whether you could change between specialisations for engineering. The confidence on how it works comes from private servers.
---
I've written this before. For alliance specifically it is VC because it's the first dungeon you go to and the only reason you went was because of the quest to get the epic loot in there. The quest doesn't mention the deadmines. It only says "go kill van cleef" so you the quester who wants the shiny blue says "lfg for vc" at which point you try to figure out where to go and what that actually means. The name stuck. After that other dungeons became known for what they were - dungeons. And the actual name of them is used. 
---
You can see plenty of versions of atlas that show the dungeon code and they say VC. Some say DM too but it has never been a permanent thing and those that think it's DM are missing the logic of why VC even came about. It was a thing way before dire maul was. 
---

---
I'm not really much of a PvPer to be fair. When I do PvP it's just casually. I picked troll just cos I think they are cool and look good in gear.
---
Orcs are ok I guess. I'll have to look up how they look in gear and the old animations, if I can find that anywhere.
---
Cannot wait for Sekiro! Shame it's so exsepncive though. I likely can't afford it until a sale.

"Education lesson" from someone that knows next to nothing about it.
---
First of all, it's not hard to find a guild that allows you to play balance. With 40 people one balance won't ruin it, and honestly most raids are borderline AFK friendly in vanilla. I guess it does require you to be a likeable person for people to accept a balance druid into raids, so I'd assume you lack experience in that regard.
---
Secondly, PvP balance shares a lot of gear with *resto druids*. I wonder if it's possible to get a raiding spot as a healer? Oh yeah, you get a spot instantly.
---
It is also easy to get deals in guilds where you can help push current raids and then be allowed to play balance on any raid the guild already cleared.
---
You clearly just run on the "lol bala sucks" bandwagon and, without experience, thinks it's impossible. I've geared a balance druid, so apparently it's \*not\* impossible. You can also find plenty of PvP videos of balance druids - they got their gear somehow as well.
---
Those cause at worst a negligible effect on gameplay and lag, and realistically zero impact whatsoever.
---
I wish Gnomish Battle Chickens were 5x larger than a male Tauren.
---
hopefully the lack of complex procs/spells/etc that clogs up the servers in retail helps enable vanilla large scale interactions.
---
IDK though. I dont trust the modern engine or their cost gutted server setup. 
---
It's called the "n squared problem" and as of right now there is no solution.  A lot of uneducated people think you can simply throw more hardware at the issue and it will solve the problem, but it's not that simple.
---
Hello! im **looking for a Guild** to enjoy Classic with!

Wow I just saw this... People take this stuff way too seriously. This was a joke I made during a dating show called "The Rajjchelor" in the same vain as The Bachelor, where I asked the girls how they feel about changes. The people who know me, know that it's a Vanilla WoW joke, and it's funny to that audience when the girls don't catch on to what I'm talking about.

---
\*\*Introduction\*\*
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded. 
---
One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment
---
 \*\*Expectations from members\*\*
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.

Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00. We will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content once available for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.
---
contact Kyte#1707 on discord for more information!
---
No, race does not affect base hp. Base hp is the amount of health you have before stamina (or any other modifiers). This only depends on your class.
---
What you are thinking about are race stat modifiers. But each point of stamina grants 10 health, so it doesn't matter that some races have more or less stamina, it's still divisible with 10.
---
one change...and im going private 
---
I wasn't speaking about pservers in general, just one particular pserver where you would get instabanned for accepting 200g without appeal.
---
ITT: People who don't know anything about server infrastructure, capacity, instance size, etc.
---
The way retail is hosted now, they use a lot of small cloud instances so that they can scale up/down as needed with very little cost. So players are sharded into these instances. And of course this means if too many people end up in the same cloud instance it starts to lag a lot (as it is a small instance).
---
This has nothing to do with the actual coding of the game.
---
The way we hope Classic is handled is to have one big instance per realm and that's it. This however costs a lot more, but since there should be a lot less cloud instances (realms) in Classic hopefully it doesn't total to be too much and will be what we're getting.
---
Okay so simply put, what should
---
The rotation look like? Objective is to last hit mobs with wand and then use sprit tap to MB to chain pull the next mob? Sorry, this is why I went warrior in vanilla 😂😂😂
---
Perhaps they did not enjoy themselves because of the attitude a lot of the pvpers brought? 
---
I quit a lot of av on private servers when the regular whine started about people being loosers, noobs and idiots for not knowing the optimal strategy for grinding reputation. 
---
Or they had surveys running, but for some reason i have a hard time seeing that. 
---
Trying to decide which class and faction to play. I can’t make up my damn mind. Stuck between Warrior and Mage. Probably going Horde.
---
It is. If you are on EU, feel free to hit me up in PM's here on reddit so I can get you into it :D 59 is truly one of the best brackets right now. Last weekend it was twink premade vs twink premade 24/7, it was a lot of fun \^\^
---
Well a tauren shaman for sure does have more base hp than an orc shaman so I dont know what you mean race doesnt affect hp
---
Do you have any narrowed down yet? I played Rogue in vanilla. I managed to get full BF with Perditions blade, etc. I can't imagine rerolling the same class.
---
All of you guys asking for buff of boss stats, removing buff in raid are also "no changers" 
---
Gnome engi gives you a a trinket that teleports you to tanaris, the goblin version is winterspring.i would always go gnome since tanaris&gt; winterspring for both factions imo.
---
This looks great!
---
I'd love for it to have alternatives, though. Most BiS lists have a lot of alternative items for the same slot, since it can be quite hard to get exact BiS and with many classes there are slots where different items are almost identical in performance.
---
Maybe put it in the dropdown menu when you click an item. So the BiS is default, but you can click the item slot and see one or two alternatives. This would probably put your prototype as my all time favourite BiS-list.
---
logged in to up vote because this is an actual solution. Not blizzard's copy pasted fixes which were proven inefficient time and time again.
---
Make the 2 hours trade window only for items obtained through master loot.
---
Not items obtained through roll system because that will encourage people needed for their friends or guild mates only to trade them later.
---
Imagine farming brd for 50+ runs for the Ironfoe, only to have someone need for their guild mates to trade them...
---
how developers like blizzard with 15+ years running the game cannot see basic stuff like that is beyond me to be honest.
---
Hundreds of hours in five years?
---
Granted, Gnomes are also 5x larger than Tauren males.
---
&gt; Besides be lucky that you can reskill at all. Once locked in, blacksmithing like armor/axe/mace etc. cant be reverted, not even by reskilling.
---
Fuck really?
---
I think they should add flying mounts into the game, and let us fly around all old zones as they originally intended.
---
Die MFer from the Swifty video lol 
---
Do an AV on a private server and you will realize that 70/80 people only want the rewards. The vocal minority are actually the people who whine about wanting AV to be some epic long battle. 
---
Cc wins teamfights, like if you can't dispell your wrecking ball warrior out of roots and poly you are gonna lose the fight since their warrior is getting dispelled and is eating everyone's face.
---
Shamans also die if they get nature locked I don't see how this is an argument. Like they can cast frostshock while healing locked - yay?
---
Lies!  There is nothing prettier than a majestic Tauren. 
---
So vanish, loot the chest, re-stealth, rather than what he said :p
---
Well, I just explained that, but I'll try again.
---
Race does not affect *base health*. Base health is the amount of health you have *without stats or modifiers*. What race does is add stat modifiers - for example stamina. The thing is, 1 stamina equals 10 hp, so no matter what stamina modifer you still end up with divisible by 10.
---
So the way the game decides you HP is this:
---
1. Your *class* has x amount of hp 
---
2. Your *race* has y amount of stamina
---
3. Your *gear* has z amount of stamina 
---
Only the first can be something not divisible by 10, since both 2 and 3 are based on stamina, so changes in 10's.
---
As a sidenote it's funny that you picked tauren and orc shaman as your example because they actually has the same stamina modifier. So if you take a tauren and orc shaman and remove all gear, buffs etc. you end up with the same hp. A troll and an orc shaman would not, since they have different stamina modifiers.
---
Listening to the soundtrack on loop. It isn’t helping.
---
ever tried talking to female human warriors ? now theres a ride .
---
Am I the only one that enjoyed 7-8k+ population? I love when the server is full of life and the cities are packed with players running around. 
---
Yeah because you can't jack off to tauren female.  
---
Unless you're into that sick filth.
---
I feel like there will inevitably be a point in the future where Vanilla Wow will become the default version of the game, much like osrs did, and more fittingly, like vanilla ice cream did :)
---
You can sac while stunned as long as ur pet isn't 
---
A general rule in product development, be it games or otherwise, is that customers are far better than the developers at figuring out what the problems are in the product, but customers are far worse than developers at coming up with solutions.
---
Reinforcements were never in vanilla.
---
If it's on retrowow, you can't take it seriously
---
This server has nothing right
---
Never once heard it called VC until I ran into Americans on pservers
---
I feel like the more important question (not that it can be answered) will be how many realms there are gonna be. If there’s the same amount as vanilla it should be easy enough to find a balanced one even if many aren’t
---
I'd say it makes the most sense to call it by xpac. Current WoW (for better or worse) is a totally different game than vanilla. Each xpac have changed the game. Calling it World of Warcraft kind of just refers to the MMORPG with Warcraft lore, but it does little to actually tell which game you play - TBC? BfA? Vanilla?
---
It's like how you don't refer to a specific star wars movie by "The Star Wars movie". It doesn't tell anything except you are talking about a movie from the Star Wars franchise. You instead refer to the specific title, like "The Last Jedi".
---
They are pretty different from more contemporary healer skillsets. In Vanilla:
---
Paladin is single target only. Never goes oom if played correctly via downranking spella and dirt-cheap flash of light. Lots of cleasing (debuff removal) in single target disease, poison,  and magic removal.
---
Shaman has no true HOTs outside of a itty bitty healing stream totem. Does decent single gadget,  and solid multi target gaming via chain heal,  but isn't a bottomless healing font like paladin. Can cleanse poison and disease,  and aoe cleanse group via totems.
---
Priest is the baseline healer with many tools and itemization catered to healing raids. HOTs, area heals, shields, fast direct heals, slower efficiency direct heals. Area heal capability is contingent upon spec. Will go oom, but typically had good regen. Cleanses disease and magic debuffs. 
---
Druids are... different. They have efficient single target direct heals that are slow. They have a direct+hot spell that is faster.  A d they have a HOT. Very little in the way of burst healing, no shields, some decent utility. One of two classes that can decurse, (only healer who can) along with poison and disease removal. Only aoe heal is on a longer cooldown.
---
[https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Blacksmithing](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Blacksmithing)

"At skill level 200 and character level 40, Blacksmiths can choose to specialize as an Armor smith or a Weapon smith. Weapon smiths can later further specialize into Hammer-, Axe- or Sword smiths. Once you make one of these choices you **cannot** go back, even by completely abandoning Blacksmithing and starting over."

Heal, tank and aoe farm
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZZtf0trcq
---
Heal, dungeon dps and 2 hand dps farm. You still have 1 more point to spent in this build, pick either Divine Favor (holy talent) or Repentance (retri talent) w/e fits your gameplay. 
---
From a pure dps point it was able to do insane dmg from it proccing before it was normalized, it also caused huge threat and dps wars had no way of dumping it
---
r/Woosh
---
having a guild bank would be good though
---
ich wish rogues had cloak of shadows and shadowstep in classic
---
I'll just copy paste another reply I made earlier.
---
Dedicated guild got one anyway
---
I had this struggle because of playing MMO’s as well. Sometimes having to defend yourself for putting so much time into a game, it can make you feel bad. 
---
But you do you man, as a grown up you can say: this is what I like, so this is where I spend my time. If you’re enjoying yourself while taking care of your responsibilities, nobody should judge you for that including yourself. Be proud of your choices, make changes when your choices don’t make you happy anymore. That makes you a good adult, having kids or getting married doesn’t.
---
Why would you spread lies about stuff like this? In this case, if you have a very high amount of reports, your account will be flagged and under investigation. There is no auto-ban.
---
For the horde! I don't know about PvP but in PvE as a warrior a lot of people will probably want you to tank haha
---
I mean obviously they weren't going to alliance, and i really don't see them ever being intended as a NPC only race, even though technically after WC3 they were all alligned with Illidan and Kael'thas.
---
Afaik Blood elves warred with the amani, they never even met with the darskpear. You could also make an arguement that they wouldn't join with orcs, because of the second war.  
---
Not on any of the 3 servers I played on, or amongs my friends. Didn't hear anything about Deadmines being called VC until Classic was announced.
---
Tbh all of WoWs music is good so I don't blame you.
---
No offense but 28 gold in WOTLK? Have you no shame? :D
---
Better than people who sit in watching trash TV.
---
Only hundreds?
---
Hi, /u/PineconeFuturism
---
What?! Is that true? xD
---
I’m going to give it a try as I love vanilla WoW, but I’ll definitely have less time. I, however, have already reached the exact job I want to have, am married, and about three of my friends actually want to play classic with me.
---
If it gets to be too much I’ll just stop. I usually manage by raid logging on the weekdays with more play time on the weekends if I feel like it.
---
Dunno about the big vanilla pserver, but people on the smaller one freak out cos the BG is played only on AV weekends, so they have limited time to grind the rep and the rewards, Im sure it will be different if the BG is played daily.
---
Play other games that you enjoy. Got sick of Apex but it was a fun 2 weeks. Back to CS:GO now. 
---
Working on leveling routes &amp; strats on Pservers.
---
Also playing Metro Exodus (on ranger hardcore it is AMAZING 10/10!) and Apex on stream at the moment. I have the below lined up until June by which point I hope Classic is either out or imminently releasing! (Please RNGesus)
---
 Outward, Anthem, Left Alive, Captain Marvel, Sekiro, TwitchCon EU, WoW Patch 8.2, Infinity War Endgame, Days Gone, Rage 2, Warhammer Chaos Bane, The Outer Worlds and Cyberpunk 2077.
---
Pretty sure it's already been confirmed that we're getting this? Presets available for modern and 2004 graphics
---
What are these weeks loto numbers btw?!
---
i dont think we can give tip to these requests. asking questions like: humanpriest or dwarf priest , warlock or spriest is something the community can help. 
---
but choosing between warri and mage?
---
Because you're asking us to know the future?
---
There was a great many things in the demo that they hadnt backported/removed from the legion client yet.
---
Enjoying WoW on the smaller vanilla pserver, its awesome, grinding CC rep atm and having fun pvping as a elemental mage :D
---
The TBC infrastructure would have to be completely changed. Places like Tempest Keep and the Sha’tari Skyguard areas are only accessible via flying mount.
---
Maybe down the line, almost certainly not on release though
---
Character copy:-)
---
According to Alex Braazie it's 100% something they pulled out their ass to balance the game
---
You can fly around zones, you just can't fly OVER them.

Hi! I'm looking for a **EU based guild**. I have experience with classic Wow, stopped playing when WOTLK was released. I'm going to play a Hunter, as I did back then. 
---
* Intended region: **EU**
---
* Intended server type: **PvP**
---
* Intended faction: **Horde**
---
* Intended raid/play times (with timezone): **Flexible, time zone** **GMT+1**
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild: **Raiding, PvP**
---
* A preferred form of contact: **PM**
---
A mage is "better" no question about that BUT a Tauren Warrior is like the coolest thing in this game.
---
Yes, instead of making wholesale changes to talent trees, professions, etc. They could have further expanded on what they had already created. This was evident in early TBC where much of the content (Kara, Hellfire Peninsula, Caverns of Time) was simply stuff they had not had time to add in 2004. The overall direction was less of an "expansion pack" and more of a new game every couple years, with less &amp; less resemblance to the original.
---
Part of what drew me into the original game was it's unfinished feel with many places like Hyjal, Hyjal raid entrance, that gated instance in Stormwind, Stormwind Vault, Azshara Crater,, the list goes on) and just the overall feeling that they could improve on what was already there in so many ways.
---
cause it is fun. i am also married and have a daughter, but that will not stop me from playing the shit out of this game. its your free time. do whatever the f you want to do.
---
messing around on my own server
---
Cheers, enjoy.
---
Where did that come from?
---
Probably bear village, how the hell do I know?
---
staring at https://days.to/until/16-july on my second monitor while i play tf2
---
If you're in a decent guild they will be supplying most of your consumes as a tank. You also shouldn't need too many of them if you're not in a hardcore progression guild, you really only need them if you're going for fast clears and want to faceroll some mechanics to save time.
---
Some people play bridge (the card game) for 40 hours a week. Is a video game any worse than that? As long as your not neglecting what you need to do in life, what is the problem with how you spend your leisure time?
---
That would be great but people bitch about vanilla rouges enough as it is. Lol
---
Granted! You will be deducted a flight tax at a rate of 1 gold per second.
---
&gt; If you solo pug with a guild group, you take on the risk of getting ganged up on rolls.
---
Not if there is no loot trading.  
---
Look, your solution to not getting effed by loot trading is to play only with trusted people. Do you not see how loot trading is warping the way you play the game? 
---
"not soon tm" basically means that we will get news within a decently short amount of time, whereas "soon tm" would have meant we would get news right around the heat death of the universe.
---
Always love stumbling upon a commenter arrogant enough to dig their own grave, and ignorant enough not to notice.
---
1. Your character won’t be a hero in classic. It will be an adventurer. 
---
2. You can buy leather like that but if its for your own use you’ll probably get plenty while leveling.
---
Sounds perfect tbh
---
He could’ve just said, race modifiers don’t modify stamina. Only other stats. 
---
How much of that lag is just addons exchanging data with other people - we used to have to tell people to turn off stuff like damage meters because it would literally kill an average internet connection &amp; client with the amount of incoming information to process in real-time.
---
I don't disagree that the modern client probably has a lot of bloat and some of the graphic effects were not designed with a large group of players gathered in one place.
---
Haha, i like the second build. You sure this heal works in dungeons? Talking about dps, I dont think it will top charts?
---
Even in world chat shift click they guy. Problem solved. Also, no one runs dire maul without specifying a wing.
---
What’s the subreddit where they do the detective work and blow OPs fake/gay story as fake?
---
Good work detective
---
&gt; Current WoW (for better or worse) is a totally different game than vanilla. Each xpac have changed the game. Calling it World of Warcraft kind of just refers to the MMORPG with Warcraft lore
---
I'd say that WOW Classic should be renamed to World of Warcraft, and the other WOW should be called to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth.
---
What about moviemaker effects and transistions? And the notepad! 
---
About a year ago i started to learn coding, as of now i came pretty far in that short amount of time.
---
Trying to land a developer job before classic!
---
and excel at nothing :D
---
Because it comes across as whiny.
---
People will always find a way to cheese the fights to take less time. When people figured out that a geared Alliance tank could pull the 4 tower bosses outside with a couple of healers while the rest of the raid takes down the boss, what do you think the de-facto strategy became?
---
If they intend to make AV play as it was originally designed, then tower bosses will be un-killable. They just never devoted any more development to AV as it was originally intended, which is sad.
---
&lt;Murloc Overlords&gt; \[Horde\] EU-Undecided Server Type
---
We are currently a group of friends that met up within WoW. Our guild was part of a larger guild that become corrupt, which led us to disband from it and go a different direction. Throughout all of us, we have people that started at BC and others at Legion. We are open to newcomers as I only joined at the end of WoD and have had minimal experience within private servers as well.
---
Our main goals are currently to just get a community of players to play throughout Classic and depending on the numbers, we can make additions to the guild like raid days/community events etc.
---
As of now, the server type that this will be played on is not decided, hopefully by the time that we have more players, we will be able to have a goal as a guild to partake in mainly PvP or PvE activities.
---
In general, this is not a hardcore guild, if that is what you are looking for, i would recommend going elsewhere. We are here to have fun and make some new friends during that period.
---
Here is our discord, feel free to join and talk to us about anything gaming related. [https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb](https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb)
---
If you have any questions about the guild, message me on reddit or join the discord and send me a PM from there (I am Cattman312 on discord)
---
I hope to talk with you soon, and if not, i hope that you find what you are looking for in the rest of this page.
---
Because horde players are more inclined to petty tribalism.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449) this one, right?
---
DM is always Dire Maul on Horde. It is possible to run as Horde, but few people ever take the time to do it.

Cata turned to shit, but it started very fun and promising.

Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Family/Raiding
---
Synopsis: Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
Focus: Leveling and PVE - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
Playstyle: Casual/Raid Focused - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. Probably looking at the very least 2 raid nights a week.
---
Are we a good fit? - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.
---
If Interested Contact Me Directly. Thank you for reading this post. 
---
That's because Horde is full of toxic children with no couth. 
---
Have you considered troll mage if your worried about so many undead mages? I think they are considered better for pve in certain areas.
---
There are already things that have been changed, lol. 
---
changes
---
Yup that's it, theorycrafters say it's the best feral weapon do or tank for the whole of vanilla. But with only 3 charges you'll have to farm a lot of them.
---
I'm a bit worried about "vanishing death coils" no longer working in the 7.3.5 engine, as it don't work on retail anymore. Can we confirm this or do we have to wait until release and see? I pretty much stopped playing my rogue after they removed the "vanish x ability" feature/bug.
---
Does that mean you can’t choose to respec from weaponsmith to armorsmith, or that once you pick axesmithing, if you relevel and choose weaponsmith, you are locked into axe smith and can’t choose sword or mace?
---
That was only on BOE items, it made them soulbound so you couldnt sell on AH. With bop drops you very much could trade them during the 2 hr grace period unless you equipped or enchanted/reforged the item. Im the type of scumbag who in DS lfr on my alt stacked the group with buddies of the same armour token/class to roll for me and trade me so i only had to do it once before i could do real content. It was abuseable and shouldn't be in classic. 
---
Because of Human Retadins and Nelf Huntards
---
Well, BfA *is* already called World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth.
---
As for Classic being called World of Warcraft, it would probably be a bit too confusing. By now, World of Warcraft is the collectie name for all the MMORPG Warcraft related games. Also, Classic isn't vanilla, and vanilla is technically the game that is called "World of Warcraft".
---
Look at it this way; we already call vanilla by the name vanilla because it's confusing to just call it WoW. If you just say WoW it always brings the questions "which version?". So they kind of need a second name to it, hence Classic.
---
At least they're not unique, so you can grab a few while you're down there :-)
---
I leveled from 55 to 60 in ZG as a Paladin.
---
thats the lolliance
---
not really. actual good +heal gear is worth more than the crappy 8/8 bonus.
---
We do get graphics options, where you can playing on modern "10" graphics or vanilla/classic graphics, but not the new character models as far as I know.
---
is it? 
---
I've always played horde. Think it goes back to liking playing horde better in the Warcraft games. Also, alliance are the bad guys, I mean who doesn't want to be the good guy?
---
I wish dwarfs could be druids.
---
Really hope we get an option for old models 
---
I thought that Tauren had a 5-10% stamina racial? 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=18727](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18727) nice hat you got there for a warrior :d
---
I used to have that feeling, but when I went home to one of my friends that got married and saw what he did on a daily basis.. let me just say that I completely changed my mindset. I have my life together better than most people (economically) but I don't want to get tied down to someone else yet, I get it that some do want to have a partner by their side but I enjoy my life where I can do whatever I want whenever I want.
---
Do whatever you want, you don't have to follow anyone.
---
currently doing 20-29 bgs with my human rogue and facing so many priests / wls that it really makes me wish to has wotf. esp. priest are untouchable cause instant fear. i though i was set on human for classic. now i am considering undead again. does this feel the same on max level? (never played vanilla, started tbc and had my very very active time in wotlk)
---
Elemental mage? Is that a way to say elemental shaman without being mocked for being an elemental shaman?
---
Good luck with your rep grind though! It's part of the game I actually enjoy as well.
---
Thanks for the link, I will join you in that!
---
You've always heard this because you've always played hordes lol. If you played alliance you would have heard the opposite a lot more. 
---
11-12 year old
---
I've been giving Final Fantasy 14 a try and am really enjoying it, I recommend it to all WoW refugees till classics out
---
Vanishing projectiles was blizzlike, if this should not work anymore then they are fucking up big time. I don't think this will happen.
---
if you gonna play with friends, tauren warrior would be more fun in a team/friend enviroment, mage would provide a better isolated solo experience.
---
Oh yeah, Tauren actually has a 5% HP boost - good catch. Forgot about that one. But otherwise it should be as my previous comment stated.
---
I don't remember the difference between pre-1.12 and post-1.12. What were the changes the introduced? I played a lot of PvP in Vanilla but I never really paid attention to the mechanics of AV, I just zerged in mid&gt;ally base and never won (or even lost lol) a single AV afaik. They were so long I always had to go in the middle of them.
---
Oh nice! I wish you the best of luck with that! My boyfriend is a games developer and while he's not working the part of the industry he'd like to, he was able to get into the industry which is great. I hope you are able to get into the industry also, and don't get shot down by not working the exact job you'd like. Get your foot in the door, and then work your way to where you want to be!
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmm i like what you got going there!
---
&gt;thinking every ban is a result of human action
---
You need to ease of on the koolaid there buddy.
---
You didn't watch that Asmongold video of him getting banned for saying "I LOVE WoW!" and asking his stream viewers to report him, to see if it is automated or not?
---
He got instantly banned right after he asked his viewers to report him.
---
It's amazing that there are people as ignorant, stupid, and gullible as you. The real question is, how much of the playerbase is actually like you? Activision Blizzard might have it easier than I thought.
---
!remindme 5 months
---
&gt; totems have only 20 yards
---
That is simply not true. Every decent ele/resto spec is going to have the 1 point in 30y range.
---
Purge being less utility than defensive dispell is also quite an interesting take, since purge is uniquely the best offensive dispell in the game and horde already has defensive dispells to their disposal anyways. On top of that: It is also a really good ability specifically against Paladins.
---
Not to mention shocks being top tier offensive abilities for PvP as well. Earthshock is as far as I know the most spammable ranged interrupt. Frostshock is a fantastic both offensively and defensively against melees.
---
As in totems vs blessings, some of the totems have extremely utility like tremor, grounding etc. You don't "simply" kill the totem either. It is a weakness that they can be killed but you have to get A past the frontline and B use an autoattack to kill them. That's quite an investment for the majority of classes.
---
Paladins are much safer, and more efficient single target healers (which I mentioned above), but Shamans have much better offensive power than paladins. A chainlightning with instant lightning bolt follow up can win just about any engagement right off the bat if you get critical strikes on them, which is reasonably likely because ele/resto shamans have so much base critical chance on their offensive spells.
---
Again, they couldn't be more different from eachother. They both heal in BGs but one is consistent, safe, straightforward and the other has lower lows but also higher highs.
---
&gt; It's generally agreed upon by PvP:ers that paladins are just straight up better.
---
This simply isn't true. You'll find alot of PvP players who will say one or the other, depending on their experiences, their class etc. I personally find them both very powerful and they can both be situationally "better" depending on the situation their in.

I have been enjoying FFXIV too! I got to 50 and was doing my relic weapon quest. Just got to the super grindy book part though... hard to keep motivated!
---
I'm really hoping they don't leash the mobs like Kazzak. It's been so long, I think Kazzak really would love a nice visit to Stormwind again. :D
---
Calling bs
---
I’m not sure I’m following — so you’re suggesting that TBC drop and then people go do all the quests in outlands for better gear, and then go do 5-mans, and then go do Kara?
---
That would require a lot of work and coordination to rescale everything. Blizzard can’t even get that right on retail. Not to mention I imagine many people wouldn’t find it fun to do hours and hours of leveling quests just for gear. And the gear would have to span a fairly lengthy power level to cover all that content — and you’d have some people coming in at lvl 58 and others coming in from Naxx.
---
Definitely go for dark souls. Best game ever.
---
&gt;It's not a fallacy if it's true
---
Isn't this a "no true Scotsman" fallacy though?
---
Other than destroying the world and ruining all classes, yea really promising
---
I had fun with [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19979](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19979) in vanilla.  As far as I knew I was the only one on my server with it.  (didn't see any others at least)
---
Swim near where people are fishing.  See if they try to fish you up!
---
We already had the old models in the classic demo at Blizzcon, so that's already there, with no option/toggle to choose the new ones.
---
Looking for a guild!
---
NA/PVP or PVE/Horde/Eastern Time, evenings/PM directly
---
I played wow back in the day, now I am a "grown up" in my 30's looking to get back into this. I play a ton of GW2 at current time, and will be setting it aside for Classic when it releases. Hoping to mostly focus on just playing the game, I want to do raids and such but I also just loved the leveling experience as well as open world pvp and normal pvp. 
---
I never really had a guild back in the day, as I was mostly not talking to internet people back when I played wow. Looking forward to finding out what guild I can join and what server to play on so I can stop worrying about it!
---
Still more interesting than the latest "Is it VC or DM?" post.
---
I see what you did there.
---
I hope you're right, as this was one of the selling points of playing rogue/mage for me.
---
You can still get screwed in groups by people needing things — you just don’t care about that because it was an issue in Vanilla already.
---
For me, I’ll happily pug and accept the risks that come along with it. My point is that you don’t have to if it’s a deal breaker. And unlike retail, not pugging isn’t that big of an issue as you’ll all but be required to find a guild and community to play with in Classic.
---
Sharding = not vanilla. Some people want that because they've been tricked into thinking the game will be unplayable without sharding. Sure the first week or 2 the game will be unplayable unless you wait in long queues and struggle to tag mobs, but then by week 3 the casuals give up (don't worry they'll be back in a month or so) and the hardcore are way beyond the starting zone so yeah by week 3 the game is completely fine, no sharding ever and you'll have 2 weeks of inconvenienced leveling. 
---
Sharding at any point and you have an altered inferior experience that could potentially find its way into late game and completely ruin the entire game. The pros do not outweigh the cons by any means. No blue post has ever guaranteed anything about there being a hard stop to sharding. They've only said they should only need to use it for the starting zones (because they don't expect classic wow to take off the way it will) mark my words sharding will be happening beyond the starting zones.
---
For me yes.
---
Maybe so, but people in this sub way overestimate how many people are going to go into Vanilla to pure min/max imo. Ret paladin is fun, Enhance Shaman is fun. I don't think a lot of people care if they're perfectly meta or top tier.
---
&gt;I'd advise against quitting unless you have another job lined up.
---
I don't but I work as a programmer/in IT in a big city so finding a job won't be much of a problem for me. Can't take holiday in the summer unless I apply for it 6 months in advance which is one of the reasons I'm quitting anyway. Trust me, WoW is the reason I'm staying for 3 more months instead of quitting right now. 
---
EU, PvE and [WPvP](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903). 
---
Fortnite. First game ever to match wow’s addiction. I rarely played FPS’s like CS, BF3 and Overwatch, i think the building aspect is what really attracted me. Still get the urge to play on P.servers but feel like a waste of time until classic comes out /: 
---
Because Alliance are little cosplaying lord of the rings butt bitches
---
A bunch of savages!! /s
---
If you think you can 'top charts' as a retri pala you are mistaken. Unless you outgear your group, there is no way.
---
Fair enough. I wish you good luck with your new work opportunities! Also good luck with the guild! I hope to see it posted in the recruitment sticky when you are ready! I always like seeing new communities come together :)
---
Honestly good question as I never induldged myself in blacksmithing personally.
---
From what I take from people on various servers who leveled blacksmithing and from who I bought services, you are locked into armor/weapon smithing. And within weaponsmithing you are locked into one of the three.
---
that's pretty much all of wow tbh
---
You shouldn't, I really do dislike my workplace. Wasting 3 hours / day on commutes alone is enough to make anyone quit. 
---
Im more hyped for obtaining Sawbones Shirt.
---
I believe in presumption of innocence, so maybe it's not as gay and fake, as I pictured it, and he has a proper explanation :)
---
Is it not possible that it was a vocal minority raging against it on the forums, and in fact not the majority?
---
A Feral cat Druid who is power-shifting to increase dps will be coming out of form &amp; then going in form again, which would give the opportunity to use bombs.
---
The most noteworthy changes were:
---
1. They significantly altered the map layout to streamline it a bit more into the middle (it used to have big areas on the sides with neutral/hostile NPCs).
---
2. Most NPCs had their strength significantly reduced.
---
3. Some NPCs were removed. This mostly affected NPCs that were hostile to everyone such as the trolls that I forget the name of (winteraxe?) and the Syndicate NPCs. Only a small number of faction-affiliated NPCs were removed.
---
4. Landmines removed. These used to force you to follow the main middle path instead of trying to go around the battle, unless you had a friend who ran in front of you at least...
---
4. Guard respawning was tweaked so that they did not respawn in everyone's faces every 30 seconds.
---
It's important to note that no private servers have been able to replicate this. They have all been based off of 1.12 clients and therefor didn't have the old map layout. They also guessed most of the values of NPCs.
---
tl;dr: PvE aspects were made less prominent, but they were still an important part of the battle.
---
Thanks, on my way to revered. Elemental mage is a fire and frost hybrid pvp and aoe spec. I have goblin engineering too, so I have sappers, a mortar and blast wave. Its a blast in an AV choke points, with a healer on me I can kill 7-8ppl in like 5 seconds. Also can delete a warrior with 4k hp in 3 seconds, frost nova (if he/she doesnt have a way to brake it) I crit fireball and fireblast for like 3.5k-4k and ignite kills them off.
---
I'm against current blizzard doing anything at all. For more information see BFA.
---
I always thought it was the concept of the game,
---
Warcraft.  
---
I don't know about Alliance hated, more people played alliance on most servers after all.  
---
but I actually genuinely enjoyed picking a side and blindly hating the other side for no particular reason.  
---
I'm the kind of guy that won't let two guys duel it out - I'm double teaming to make something unfair,
---
ganking people that go for the same quest NPC  
---
ganking people that look at me funny
---
ganking people that breathe  
---
I dunno man - it's just, sometimes it's just fun to have a perfectly justifiable reason to be a petty asshole to people.  
---
Warcraft was the embodiment of my teen angst and I used to play at a netcafe that was 90% warcraft players.  
---
everyone would go down on the weekend and take the piss out of each other and make horde or alliance jokes
---
I just felt like it was all sort of in good fun and it was just fun to support a team.  
---
Also most of my friends were introduced to wow by somebody else, and the flow-on effect of that is generally playing together and having the same experiences as your friends, e.g if YOUR individual friend group liked Alliance, most people you know played Alliance and hated horde, Or if you friends started out on horde, you were probably never going to make an alliance toon.
---
Sapper Bae
---
😂 perhaps 
---
\&gt;  Because Warlocks are one of the least played classes and are required in raids for summons you will probably find a spot easily 
---
We may not be the best DPS, but being a reliable taxi service that passes out healthstones to passengers is an A+ way to ingratiate yourself to your guildies.
---
Granted, but the game will have flying mounts in it.

 **&lt;Always East&gt; | Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance**
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**.
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460 or Kegg#8900**) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you! Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***

**Reach out if you have questions!**

---
I don't personally value the leveling experience/speed too much, you'll only be leveling for the first 1-2 months you play the game depending on how casually you play.
---
I'd say go with whichever you think is "cooler", whichever one you like more you'll be more likely to deal with the inevitable downsides every class has.
---
Meh, I was gonna share this here too but thought it was too cliché
---
&gt; Just go on their fucking Reddit or WoW forum and make a discussion about how bad the servers are and you'll get flamed like shit.
---
Dude, what? There have been semi-regular posts about the lag on /r/wow for a while and people are not exactly defending it. Here's one from just two weeks ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ar9xc7/is_blizzard_ever_going_to_comment_on_the_server/
---
350 score, 90% upvoted. Not exactly "flamed like shit".
---
**&lt;Always East&gt;** might be a good fit for you.  Check out my post (either above or below, unsure where it will land for you) and reach out if you have questions/interest.
---
Completely wrong, horde tanks did this all the time.
---
Well played.
---
AV now has very little PvP. It’s largely a race to clear the PvE content. It’s only when something goes “wrong” that there’s PvP and then people start leaving. I think the original AV was the coolest version.
---
Probably because EU is so crappy they have to turn to the US to have any kind of fun.  
---
I’ve actually considered that. It’s unfortunate that the WOTF is such a good ability compared to the trolls more pve related abilities. Thanks for the thought though!
---
"If you disagree with me youre stupid" 
---
 the absolute state of this subreddit.
---
No you are the one who is overly pessimistic, you are making claims without any facts. Dont throw the optimism card when you clearly were over the top pessimistic 
---
Cranking one out
---
Good food for thought regarding the starting area. Great point
---
I really don't trust blizzard at all with sharding. Look at the current game. Their excuse for sharding is to make the launch run smoother which was hardly ever a problem in the past. Anyone who played BC at launch back in the day knows what launch day looks like it's not the smoothest experience sure, but it's not like it's a permanent hindrance on the game. Sharding will not be used lightly, no way current wow devs use sharding sparingly look at what they re doing right now. Who is arguing for sharding in retail that its become the shit show that it is today? No one wants sharding in retail and it's everywhere. Why would classic be any different?
---
This is an entitled opinion. Lots of people like current WoW. They prefer it as a streamlined, singleplayer action RPG. Just because YOU don't like it doesn't make their opinions wrong.
---
90g for a battle chicken isn't a horrible deal.
---
Made it to level 30 with less than 15fps back in the day. When my parents upgraded the computer and I could get a solid 30 and low medium? Oh man. Was that exciting.
---
Eh as long as they do the staggered content release, it won't be bad. Since xrealm bgs were added late and toward the end of vanilla. It did have a huge negative impact on the PC experience though. I hope it's not in at the start, that would be really really lame.
---
There was nowhere near as much lag back in Warlords of Draenor. Kits and effects have been massively downsized since those days.
---
The problem is that Blizzard has started writing technology that compartmentalize the idea of what an "area" is since Mists of Pandaria. This was to **cut costs**. The basic idea is that there is no point dedicating threads or hardware to areas that don't need it, so through incredibly efficient software, they are capable of performing much more with much less space.
---
The point of which is to, of course, downsize their very costly, powerful servers at no performance hit. The problem is that the peak processing power of any given instance of an area has been significantly cut. It might be as simple as adding additional memory and duplicating the thread pool size. We don't know anything about their internal architecture.
---
What we **do** know is that private servers are capable of delivering a no-lag experience by brute forcing the issue using hardware.
---
Yeah it was amazing. It kinda sucked when the Chinese would log on and you could feel the systems struggle, but man that was insane. The cities were FULL and the world was populated.
---
Chromie obviously
---
You have the general idea right, but it will be closer to PvP:  Even and PvE:  Slight alliance dominance.  I think we agree that pve will have less horde as compared to pvp, but I think it's more in favor of alliance overall.
---
Not talking for RP but, for normal servers, it is obvious it will be different on each server. Many people have said that in Vanilla it was either a bit alliance or a bit horde unbalanced, and on others it was about 50/50. It is obvious from a statistical point of view that there won't be any consensus.
---
You won't really be able to know in Classic either unless you create your character a few months after release where it will have set up.
---
And all that stuff you've heard about pservers where most people minmax and apparently choose a faction based on racials (like horde racial &gt; ally racial in PvP), just forget about it. Most Classic players won't care anyway, because most players will be casual, fortunately. So if you're basing your choice of server on this, just play whatever you want (as every sane people will say you, since it's a game).
---
you are in the wowclassic sub, so most will suggest classic, cause they think its the much better game (me included). in fact classic wow and retail (bfa) are to complete different games. ibut objectively if you enjoy the mmorpg aspects of games, then wow classic would be the better option for you.
---
Back in 2016 there was an interview with one of the Blizzard developers explaining how they increased the complexity of the game's netcode which let them design more challenging PvE encounters, and they gave an example how Mythic Imperator Mar'gok was a fight that wasn't possible on the old netcode. The waves that pulse outward from the boss, the one that the entire raid needs to jump requires a very high degree of precision. Before they upgraded the netcode they just didn't have any way to track the players' movement to that degree of precision.
---
The downside to increasing precision is that server load also goes up. That's not necessarily a problem because the server has a certain budget. As long as you don't exceed the server's capacity everything will run just fine. Problems only arise when players do something unexpected, like when they host a 80 player PvP battle on infrastructure that's designed to handle PvP encounters no larger than 15 vs. 15. From an engineering perspective it's all about tradeoffs.
---
The modern combat system is a lot more complicated and the game isn't designed to handle 40 vs. 40 anymore. That's a deliberate choice by Blizzard. Blizzard aren't stupid. They know there will be raid vs. raid PvP where entire guilds fight over world bosses. They must have realized a long time ago that classic WoW has very different requirements from modern WoW and that they needed to make provisions to enable classic to even function.
---
The problem is people play for rewards and not for fun.
---
Does that mean they have a greater max range? 
---
Thank you for being an ambassador of WoW Classic and always nice to meet people here who are subscribed to my channel.  
---
Kind regards  
---
This was fascinating to read.  It's like you were arguing with a brick wall.  More patience than most, well done.
---
Oh sounds fun. I never really tried mage past level 10/11 in vanilla so I don't know much about them.
---
I feel like if you have to crank it, it's broken.
---
Granted, but using stoneform shapesifts you into a rock. You are now a stationary rock unable to go anywhere.
---
Tbh hord do just fine without it but it can require to use 2 tank because of the cooldown of the built-in anti fear.
---
So in my opinion the hype is more about taking a shortcut than absolute necessity.
---
I would love to know where you guys are finding those 20v20 fights.  At the start of the expansion it was always 40 horde v 1 alliance, and since they 'fixed' warmode it's now always 40 alliance v 1 horde.
---
Can we get a new internet "law" similar to Godwin's Law for people who type in alternating caps?  
---
Like :  "As Reddit conversations go past 2 comments, the chances of typing a reply or meme in alternating caps approaches success.  First person to do so automatically loses the debate/topic."
---
We could call it Cheng's Law or something.
---
If you kill a mob with another mind controled mob so you get loot rights or xp? 
---
Granted, we are now bfa with all the latest spells and improvements! Enjoy!
---
Granted. Only dwarfs can be druids. Since both palas and druids are Alliance only Blizzard makes Warriors Horde only to ”balance the tanks”
---
Granted, but every time you go stealth there will be Mr. Norris and Argus Filch haunting you and screaming "students out of bed! students out of bed! Students in the corridor!"
---
The alliance in WoW isn't the same alliance in war 3. The humans that betrayed them all got turned into scourge/forsaken... so there's yet another reason they should never have ended up in the horde.
---
Thanks for the informative reply! I do remember the Winteraxe trolls at Snowfall (was it?) now when you mention it. I don't remember the name but I remember that it was a big troll that protected that GY.
---
No memories of Syndicate though, where did they hang out?
---
I don't have any recollection of landmines or a different map layout, but I've noticed that they have changed the map layout lately as well (Stonehearth GY is on a small ledge now) so I can imagine that they have been experimenting around with it previously too.
---
I did like these PvE aspects of the BG, as impopular as it might be, but I do think it might be good to have a version which has been iterated on to some extent, so it might be good anyway. As I don't remember too clearly the difference and shift 1.12 brought I can't really say I prefer one or the other.
---
welll... fuck. 
---
&gt; Classic isn't vanilla, and vanilla is technically the game that is called "World of Warcraft".
---
&gt; 
---
Classic is a patched vanilla
---
At the end of TFT the bloodelfs are pretty much done for. They got beaten by Arthas and the Scourge. Them taking back their homeland and joining the horde is a way too big stretch lore wise. It was done for gameplay reasons, not lore reasons. Same goes for the Draenei. In BC they started bending the lore way too much to fit it to their gameplay purposes.
---
&gt;Their excuse for sharding is to make the launch run smoother which was hardly ever a problem in the past.
---
!!! Holy shit I wish I played on servers as stable as yours during expansion launches.
---
Good story, too bad it's not true.
---
At least up until WOTLK it was the Horde leader characters for me. 
---
Coming from WC3, most of all Thrall ofc, but also Cairne, Vol'jin and Sylvanas are just much more appealing than the Alliance leaders. Tyrande was alright I guess, but the others weren't really that interesting. 
---
My best guess is the classic team will be lazy and just have 1.12 itemization.
---
Get ready for every warrior and enh shaman trying to farm savage gladiator armor!
---
Should be the same as with hunter pets. You have to hit the target at least once to get loot. 
---
You are just indecisive because you've already imagined the scenarios in which you hate each class without thinking about the work around for each.
---
Here's just a few examples: 
---
\- You can lvl that undead mage to a bare minimum of 5 ( which doesn't take much time ),  take the zeppelin to orgrimmar and run to mulgore, it'll take time sure but if you think about it, you're going to have to walk those exact distances while lvling later on either way , so picking the FP's while going to mulgore will be a big plus.
---
\- You can play dps warrior in raids, the amount of time to gear will be just the same but the dps potion/elixir/flasks are cheaper in comparison to tanks , especially later on, also going dps warrior means you are already working on some of your pvp off pieces from pve.
---
The only thing cliché in my opinion is the word itself, there is no cliché character in vanilla, you also don't have to mix undead + mage together , each are separately used a lot for very good reasons ,there are just as many warriors running around as there are mages , if not more. 
---
To say undead specifically is overused in pvp would be a disservice towards orcs who are often just as populated as undead, same thing applies for alliance using dwarf/gnomes, pvp racials will always be prevalent over others in pvp which is why people pick such racials in the first place, don't pay attention to the trends if you don't find said races enjoyable, you could always roll a troll mage and avoid seeing the undead starting zone altogether.
---
As for your debate / struggle between warrior and mage, it's fairly easy to feel and normal to be attracted to polar opposite playstyles , nothing shows this more than warrior vs mage but ask urself which you find coolest / most enjoyable? swinging a big 2H all up in a player's face or  shooting magic from far away ? these questions often seem cliché themselves ironically but they often always give the right answer because deep down you will always love one of the choices more than the other even if you aren't aware of it.
---
Well Rogue pvp trinket removes fear. Don't change your preferred faction based on one spell from one class imo.
---
I'd love them to have between 4k-6k. I think it's perfect. Crowded, but not too crowded. Active world PvP, fast group forming, kicking economy, fast BG queue...
---
What was the original server's cap back in 2005? 
---
Having a couple of warlocks is critical is doing some city raid shenanigans.
---
Well I think that part of the problem is that the mentality changed over the years and PvPers don't really see AV the same way that they do AB or WSG. The mentality is a lot more focused now and people see AV as as a rep grind for gear unlocks while WSG and AB are seen as the proper competitive PvP BGs.
---
The problem with AV is that PvE players don't want to PvP and serious PvPers don't take AV seriously because they can't get competitive games there. So that leaves a minority of PvPers who genuinely enjoy AV for what it is. The result is that AV is pretty much dead three weeks out of the month and only played on its BG weekend.
---
Don't interrupt the circlejerk.
---
&gt;no cliché character in vanilla
---
Male UD rogue STV gankers would like to have a word with you.

I think a lot of us in the late 20’s / early 30’s will go through the same feeling. I definitely have less time than I did when I was 13 - full time job and a gf. The beauty about being an adult is that I know what I like to do and don’t have to apologize to myself or anyone. I go to work, go to the gym, eat dinner, and I set aside a few nights a week or one night on the weekend where it’s simply ok to play WoW until late night. As long as your significant other understands this, life should be just fine. Most people sit and watch TV shows anyways, what’s the difference? 
---
&gt;Does anyone have the post or "blog" piece by Gurgthock (Ion) about the impact of consumables vs gear on character power before the big consumable revamp early BC or late vanilla?
---
I've been looking for the same thing. This might work for you

Honestly, to me it sounds like you're more excited to play the Tauren Warrior.  So start with the Tauren Warrior.  If you hit the wall somewhere in the 30-50 slog, then roll your UD Mage alt and start leveling him for a while.  Vanilla isn't going anywhere, so unless you're trying to push the bleeding edge of progression with the best guilds around, there's no need to rush to 60!
---
Sadly there in the case of no sharding You are wrong on both fronts. Pretty sure there is between a 2500 pop cap on classic servers which means literally it will be almost impossible for 1k to be in 1 zone at a time unless people just ignore specific races(only 500), feel free to post proof of a larger pop cap. 
---
I’m particularly fond of Dun Morough, Tanaris (BFD is my favourite dungeon) and STV.
---
And as for the main theme, 100% chance to apply aura: goosebumps
---
Granted, but everytime you shift into bear form people panik around you, screaming "the bear ate the dwarf!" and atack you.
---
Can you link proof of this? I haven’t heard of this being set in stone other than people on Reddit + classic podcasts. Haven’t seen anything of a blizzard thread or something similar 
---
who gives a shit im insanely disgusted and dissapointed that this legendary shaman forum meme got downvoted.
---
Deadmines was in game at launch.
---
&gt;I just like doing quests, leveling up, having awesome skills, all the things you can do in a MMORPG.
---
Then classic wow for you! The new wow (BFA) is just a "hurry up and get max level, then you can play the game which is subpar". As for classic, leveling is a huge part of the game, the quests matter, the mobs matter, and your interactions with other players... matter. It's a true mmorpg, not the single player type game that modern wow is.
---
&gt;The game is 15 years old and has only received one major rewrite all the way back in cataclysm.
---
The fuck are you talking about? They just had probably the biggest one ever just before Bfa. Have you been sleeping for 9 years? 
---
Alliance is far more Tolkien and generic fantasy in nature, and in vanilla attracted far more players, for better or (usually) worse.
---
Horde due to the amount of people who played WC3 and just preferred the choice of races better, and saw people who picked alliance as a bunch of dorks rolling as something so bland and uninteresting.  And to be honest as someone who doesn't care much for the lore, the alliance faction leaders were pretty damn boring in comparison.  
---
But man do people love their fantasy tropes, so more people still rolled alliance.  And yes, often "teh noobz" who could identify by rolling as a human or a more familiar dwarf over say a zombie or minotaur.
---
most private servers are like 70/30 alliance to horde
---
yeah, getting ganked in STV every 30 seconds (probably a low estimate) was great... in all seriousness though it was pretty cool besides that.
---
&gt;Rogue:
---
&gt;   Kings of WPvP
---
**Every 10minutes, as long as you don't fight a hunter, mage, warlock, or druid.
---
Yes you can berserker rage fears, of course you can, but you cannot keep it up indefinitely because fears have less CD than berseker rage itself. Go take a look at some numbers lol.
---
I agree that original AV was the coolest but I can tell you almost no one with a job will dedicate 6+ hours to one battleground then end up losing and getting no bonus honor for it. At release, I was fresh outta high school and had oodles of time on my hands and still only queued AV a handful of times before the changes were made. My time was better spent elsewhere. The idea for old AV was truly epic and it was a cool experience. I have fond memories of escorting Lokholar down that final corridor to the Alliance bridge on my way to my first AV win. The fact is, no matter how awesome it was, if it takes 6 hours to complete, people won't be doing it.
---
Thanks, I appreciate the detail.
---
True. Assuming 1.10 items aren't in game at the start yes.
---
Browsing this sub, playing Smash Bros Ultimate, and reading manga.
---
Holy cow..
---
For other people reading that aren't fact resistant, this is simply not how it works pre-Naxx.  I'm done here, GL.
---
Well not with *that* attitude!
---
No you have to tag the mob to get loot and xp.

Nope. No tauren or priests for tauren. 
---
There are usually people advertising runs with "sellables reserved" or all BoE's reserved for the tank, etc. I always ignore these, but I'm sure there are people who go along with it because they don't mind or it's convenient, etc.
---
They can only do this if the community has need for their service - if more people/tanks are doing it then the "reserved" people will not fill their groups,
---
Of course, if people do this they have to guarantee a solid run, otherwise there is little incentive for people to even consider it.
---
As for those runs with specific drops reserved, what's the point of going if they want to reserve items that are not BoP - it's the same as if they were charging gold to be invited the group. I'm not going to pay someone (or pass up the chance at a valuable drop, which is the same thing) to be able to join a pug group. I'd rather get in a decent guild and clear it with guildies. If items are reserved in a guild, it's usually because someone needs the item for progression &amp; that's what these pug/reserved groups are probably doing - why should I pay some other guild with time, effort &amp; possibly gold if it will mostly help THEM out?
---
It's funny people still think rogues are these unstoppable pvp machines. They're extremely cd dependent to win even the most basic encounters. Also easily the worst group pvp class (BGs).
---
They are however, very good at ganking lower levels. Or last hitting someone after they pulled a mob and didn't realize a rogue was nearby.
---
Like 80% of the bullshit I did in vanilla wouldnt have happened without my friend who was a lock. I remember raiding Darnassus as like level 25
---
Don’t feel bad, I’m married AND a parent and I’m still making my way back to classic WoW.
---
Yeah, if your friends have always played Horde and you have always played Horde that's what you will hear. I've heard terrible things about both. I remember back when /nosg/ was a thing the Alliance players there had some choice words for Horde, and Horde choice words for Alliance. If you thrust yourself into a community that mostly plays Alliance, prepare for some Horde shit talking. :)
---
I'm married with a kid now. I'm going to play with my brothers who I used to play with back in the day. In fact my youngest brother who was too little at the time really wants to play as well this time. 
---
But it's not only pure nostalgia- my 5 year old son loves playing on a private server with me. He needs a lot of help, but it's a great way to spend time together. 
---
Point is, you don't have to go back. We love Vanilla because it's a really great game. Play it as that. And if you feel like you're unhappy with where your life is, take steps toward a goal, even little ones. But enjoy WoW classic to the fullest.
---
Fucking bumping, everywhere
---
I fear going to a 2K online server will feel dead in comparison
---
Haha I know! Too many clueless people here, it was absolutely hilarious!
---
Thanks!
---
It's not a game, it's an adventure. Just immerse yourself in the world and everything will come naturally as you progress
---
Which manga are you reading? Anything good?
---
BGs weren’t cross realm when they launched. Seeing the same few hundred names in every AV was part of the community building for the server and cross realm BGs killed this for shorter queue times.
---
Honestly, I think hunters and druids are better at ganking lower levels due to their much MUCH higher mobility and range.
---
Send a hunter or druid into lake shire and that place will be cleared in seconds.  A rogue has to manually chase each person down with his shit movement speed.
---
“The game isn’t designed to handle 40 vs. 40 anymore”
---
“Blizzard aren’t stupid”
---
Oh I’m sorry, I thought this was the WORLD of Warcraft 
---
Keep in mind if you pick Warrior, you can tank any 5 man as long as you throw a shield on. I am expecting tons of people to roll a Warrior to do mad DEEPS as Fury with zero interest in ever even trying tanking. If you are planning on being a dedicated tank, you will have a much easier time finding a raid spot than Fury #3093514. If you're willing to just tank 5 mans, groups come easy and free and you can gear up that much faster. 
---
Mages are absolute kings in pvp and gold farming, insane dps too, once fire is viable. 
---
Dude who cares. Do whatever is fun and makes you feel relaxed. Society has normalized binge watching TV shows hours on end. If anything playing WoW (or video games in general) is more mentally stimulating than that. 
---
Maybe pick up a new hobby along with starting playing classic wow again? And just take breaks while you’re playing. Or find some audio books to listen to while you level. Productivity!
---
There are multiple reasons why BFA lags terribly when there are big groups fights. It is a combination of sharding, cross-realm functions, software and hardware, alto the hardware part impact is minimal, but still exists.
---
Sharding is a great tool to "instance" players in smaller groups, but it sux when the groups are "forced" to be a certain number, in this case, 80 players. ActiBlizz cannot shard BG's differently than it shards the open zones. It can be done, but costs will rise a lot.
---
The cross-realm function is a no-brainer. Multiple players from different realms are "connected" under the same shard, but they also belong to a "host" realm that is different from the "host" realm on another player that interacts with the said player or multiple players. The language between the "hosts" realms are "slowed" down, to be able to have a "dialogue" between them, within a shard that is common to multiple realms.
---
The software part is the biggest one here. Due to the fuckloads of QoL features present in BfA (guild features, achievements, transmog, etc.), each player constantly have an achievement in progress, is completing a progress, uses a guild feature, changes the tmog on a daily basis, etc. Another software issue is the graphic, spell effects, gear detail (tmogged or not), terrain detail, etc. are extremely well done and eat a lot of memory...but all those are possible because of sharding. The moment you get 80 people that PvP (using a lot of spells and skills ) on a shard designed to handle 40-50 people doing normal stuff, you are going to see a visible "slow" down in server response. Add in the cross-realm function, achievements, and all other functions that are permanently "talking", and you get a MASSIVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION that have to be handled on a shard designed for much, much less.
---
The hardware part also adds to this, even if it is minimal. But that adds up, and it also counts.
---
Will Classic have the same lag?
---
No, not even close. There will be lag in Classic, but because all players involved are on the same realm, there are no additional functions that run in the same time (achievements, guild features, tmog), the spell effects are basic, compared to retail, the graphics will be as good as retail, but simpler in details, no cross-realm "dialogue", no sharding.
---
The Classic servers should be able to handle hundreds of players on an area, with acceptable lag, because sharding especially, won't exist, hence, no need for a "forced" tweak of a shard designed for 50 people to handle hundreds.
---
Basically, there will be FAR LESS INFORMATION that the servers will handle in Classic, and the lag will increase because of the number of players, and not because of tweaked shards, forced dialogue between realms, spell effects designed for shards, and not for big battles, no tmog, etc. etc.
---
70/80% of the players also dob't give a rats ass and will happily afk in the tunnel while they passively farm their BiS lists, too.
---
These people hardly even count in my eyes, and are the first ones to jump at you and say "why would I pay blizzard to play classic when I can play here for free".
---
I think I honestly hate the private server community far more than is reasonable.
---
To be fair 7 out of 8 players on pservers don´t really care about the game in other aspects too. Their guides say never group up or do dungeons you waste xp/hour. They shit all over the game in the same way retail snobs do. I will avoid both groups once this game launches.
---
I agree the issue is that their cloud instances can’t handle excessive load. The real problem underlined here is that for cloud providers to maximize profit they need to fit as many instances on a node as possible.
---
When there is a big lag spike it is most likely due to insufficient host resources (CPU or Memory) and that particular instance then has to queue up and wait for resources to become available. Another cause is that when a link between the primary database availability group and its replicas are broken, quorum is taking too long to check all of the paths resulting in large spikes as the new leader is elected and transaction logs are replayed to catch up.
---
I would really be interested in finding out how much they spend in cloud versus the cost of modern, geolocated data centers. At least with your own data center you can manage host resources and network convergence versus relying on big cloud.
---
Yeah I didn't even take into account all the different calculations that are going on in regards to mobs and abilities scaling with players along with players scaling with players in bg's. 
---
Yes! I have people who get on me about playing games, but these same people will sit around and watch T.V all day. 
---
At least i’m forming relationships and making progress on the screen i’m staring at. 
---
On another note OP, you do you. My dad owns a business and he still makes time to play classic. He always claims he feels like he’s wasting time and could be doing work related stuff, but he keeps playing because deep down it gives him a break from real life and he enjoys it. Do what makes you happy!!
---
Fears and zerker rage are on the same 30sec cool down. I don't need to lookup numbers I did the damn zerker dance for a year on vanilla. 
---
Thug shirt is the best shirt.
---
Do alliance players not get the same shirt the orcs do?
---
(The only shirt I knew that was different between races was the troll shaman shirt and the orc one, orc being brown and the troll being colorful)
---
I don't have much to show atm, mostly testing the theme so far, i'm building a Sylvaneth/Wanderer army with Night Elves inspired theme. But you can look me up on Instagram ( @Humpelminis )  to follow my progess :D 
---
Working up the base of the army now, but have a few really fun subprojects for it planned:
---
\- Illidan and a few demon hunters made out of 40k "mandrakes" (google for reference)
---
\- Alarielle the everqueen made in Tyrande's colors (Don't know if I dare because it will be difficult, but I would like to try to do a custom head for her in greenstuff too!)
---
\- Lots of dark elves from "Raging heroes" arriving soon, which will be painted as night elves.
---
The idéa is also to have my elves sort of rule the trees, and see the treelords etc as "Ancient of war" and such :) 
---
I guess from my writing this much says how much I'm hyped for this project :D 
---
&gt;Final fantasy tactics
---
Just some advice from someone who played old school FFT numerous times. 
---
* Don't get caught up trying to find all the Act 1 secret items in the maps.  I think my first few games of FFT all ran out of steam because I spent so long trying to find every maps secret item (I used GameFaq's to find them too, but still it's a slog).  Also, don't try to wait for every single enemy body to turn into a crystal.  If one does, great: but otherwise don't try to farm skills off enemies: you'll need the JP from actions anyways so better to do it that way.
---
* Don't grind \*too\* much with non-advanced classes early on.  That being said, make sure you make a few "safe" save spots where you like your team is progressing: Reason I mention this is because if you don't you could find yourself in a situation where the Act 1 Boss is unbeatable and if you didn't' have backup save files you could screw yourself.
---
* Don't focus on using the Summoner class so much.  Sure early on it's a decent AoE utility class that can put out some early game numbers, but later on other class combinations are much more powerful.
---
Also, you know WC3 Reforged is probably going to be released soon-ish? 
---
Is the battle chicken any use at lvl60? 90g should get you a Darkmoon card and my other trinket slot will be the pvp trinket.
---
Sometimes you just gotta take a step back and let the world spin without you for a little while
---
I feel like this is going to set you up for disappointment though.  I love TBC and would probably prefer it over Vanilla, but playing TBC only to turn around and play vanilla and not have all the improved class specs/abilities/better tier gear would ruin the experience for me (personally).
---
I totally understand what you are saying. Private Servers is not for everyone. One thing I have learned from playing on p-servers is to really enjoy the present and not worry to much about the future. I would for sure have been very disappointed if I would have actually lost all charters. The shutdown of Nostalrius was sad but at the same time it was the most epic experience I have ever had in wow, just look here, AMAZING: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZexqZnDU0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZexqZnDU0I)
---
Later we got the accounts back on a new server, then there was a muteny and that was shut down and we got all charcters back again on a new server and I can still play on them. Unfortunately I don't really want to though because after Naxx the realms kinda die and people move on to fresh. Vanilla is great and all but after Naxx it become pretty broken. That can be fun and all, but its more fun to start over.
---
Chad Tauren warrior any day
---
I think his point is that he's missing out on those things because he just wants to play classic
---
You tried Elder Scrolls Legends?  I stopped playing Hearthstone but may go back to it for the new season/year if the expansion/changes they are making seem better for the health of the game.
---
PvE and PVE RP servers were like 90-10 Alliance favored. 
---
And even on PvP servers, at BEST it was 50-50 split.  Horde were always super outnumbered just because back in 2004/2005 people preferred to be the more Tolkien faction.  LoTR had a lot to do with that too.  So many Nelf hunters named XxLegolasssxX
---
Specifically, Sylvanas offered help and the Belves took it because they knew her. This was back when Vereesa and Rhonin were still locked away inside the Dalaran bubble and, for all anyone knew, Alleria and Turalyon were gone forever. It was an allegiance based on the devil you know being better than the one you didn't. It wasn't a bad choice back then either, considering Thrall's Horde was super chill and Sylvanas hadn't been turned into a cartoon villain yet.
---
Where can I get this?
---
Dun Morogh is definitely an underrated area imo. 
---
Currently on a binge of Berserk-esque manga due to the series being put on hiatus again.
---
I'm currently reading Vagabond but I've finished Claymore and Vinland Saga recently.
---
I certainly *hope* they've realised, and bothered to do something about it. Realised and decided it's not worth fixing is also an option . . . 
---
I loved AV. It was by far my favorite battleground and frankly I’m tired of all the instant gratification players getting their way. 
---
If I had to guess, it's a quest chest not the usual random chest.
---
Oh cool. What spec is used for gold farming? Will definitely need an alt for that to fund my main, and mage would be a unique thing for me.
---
Making level 60/70 twinks on retail. No need to do current content when the old stuff is so much better!
---
If you worry about PvP racials that much consider rolling Orc Warrior instead of Tauren.
---
Tauren are great in PvP if they can make use of the stun to cast important spells, such as shamans or to get distance from melees such as hunters.
---
In general the Orc racials are superiour for PvP both in terms of survivability and damage, especially for melee classes.
---
But I wouldn't actually worry about racials too much. Play the race you like.
---
They aren't using keybindings more than likely. If I had to guess, we have a clicker here.
---
No I haven't I'm not a big card game player (because I'm not very good and I like picking cards for fun, not meta).
---
Well considering nothing in classic requires this new precision net code. Tho it would maybe be cool. They could just go back to the old one to start.
---
Also what's a server cost nowadays. How many servers are they planning to have? Maybe they just run new servers that can handle classic as it was.
---
Looking for a german guild. (DE/EU)
---
My brother and me are looking for a german (semi-)hardcore guild.
---
We got solid experience with the classic 40 man raids (My brother including Naxx and me until BWL)
---
Please PM me if you plan to create a german guild.
---
I’m 27 and never really got to play WoW due to having a potato computer. I resorted to Runescape whilst all my friends talked about WoW at school.
---
I’m very pumped to play classic on release, I’m curious if there will be guilds for people like myself. People experiencing the game for the first time and trying to understand boss mechanics/dungeons as a first time player.
---
Would it be good to be apart of something like that? Or would it be more beneficial to join an experienced guild to help me along the way?
---

Not sure if this was intentional but I chuckled

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server.
---

---
Pretty much. Also this:
---
&gt; people who downplay these things as a non-issue are not real Vanilla WoW lovers
---
That's pretty textbook /r/gatekeeping
---
i can find some PVP pretty easy, whenever those invasions are up there always group PVP to be had. Or just go hunt assasins, or become one yourself. Generally always ends up in PVP. 
---
If the front end works the exact same what does it matter if the back end is different?
---
Missing bold text for "Druid" title :D  
---
Anyway, thanks !
---
Rogue: easier to level on PVP servers as you can avoid gankers while travelling and when you're jumped. As with druids, they're safe to /afk without having to log out.
---
I don't have instagram but I had a quick peak and what you have on there already looks really well done! I do hope you share your WoW themes stuff here when you feel comfortable.
---
Its usually deep frost, similar to frost pvp. With all the slows iceblock, barrier and stuff. But the hybrid I use is good too, since I have blastwave, shatter and iceblock, no barrier though. Can send u some of these specs later if u want.
---
I play mostly for fresh tbh so if sharding is a thing at all i'll just take a wow break till lights vengeance then have fun running through TBC. 
---
Oooh Claymore, not looked at that in years! I'll have to check some of these out. Thanks for the pointers!
---
Do you twink alone, or do you have a guild of twinks you do things like the raids with?
---
 **&lt;Requiem&gt;** \- Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
**Intro:** We are a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.  Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers.  We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities.  We're also not asking you to give up PVP.  And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:**  Building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.   
---
*\*If you have past experience with being a raid/class leader (or even no experience at all) and are interested in applying for an officer position, PM me.*  
---
**Expectations:**  Be courteous and respectful of all members.  No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.

They literally have a fucking brawl on retail that is 40 v 40 people...
---
Here's a few things you got wrong / missed:
---
\- Kings of wpvp varies depending on the level ranges, usually below 60 hunters and druids are gods, especially in the early stages of the patch progression , much stronger than rogues.
---
 At 60 rogues are strong if they want to gank people who are at a disadvantage but if the player is full hp and aware of the rogue fights might not end up the way people expect, rogue has a lot of counters in a lvl 60 fair fight, if anything if you're planning on fighting equally skilled/geared players I'd say: mages / hunters/ warlocks / Spriests are best for solo wpvp at 60, rogues only shine in disadvantageous situations where you bully weaker people.
---
\- Shaman full resto is meh in group pvp, elemental/resto hybrid is the best spec for offhealing/spell casting , sadly Rshams will never be main healers in premade bgs, it's mostly priests who do the main healing while shams focus on burst/totems/purges and off heals.
---
\- Druid level is not middle in terms of speed/ease, it's right under hunter, druid often compete with warlocks for the 2nd spot in fastest levelers in the game and often they are, you have less downtime as a druid than as a warlock if you know what you are doing, you can avoid ganks entirely and unfavorable encounters with stealth and you can bypass mobs you don't want to waste time on to get to the quests you need, you can solo elite in bearform so long as they aren't 3+ lvls above you, you can tank/heal/dps any dungeon while leveling only using your feral leveling spec + having off gear for healing , meaning you are the class most sought after for dungeons while lvling, no group will turn you down and most will beg you to tank for them, this means waiting for a group is much less than other classes during the leveling process, and finally wpvp is awesome while leveling, your kit beats most of the classes early on and if you are ever in a tight spot you can just up and run away and no one can do anything about it, this class is so underrated it's insane.
---
\- You failed to mentioned that paladins are THE BEST healers in the game for both pve AND pvp, yes you heard me, priests come second after paladins in terms of ST efficiency and survivability both of which put paladins as the main group healers in pvp, though priests are more versatile due to their kit also having aoe/hot/shields/ offensive dispels and CC, they are often assigned the offensive healer roles in bgs where they spam dispel enemy players a lot to remove buffs and such then healing the group ( just like shamans) while paladins focus on the protective side of things , like topping players/ friendly dispels/ blessings etc.
---
\-Also worth noting that healing priests have differing playstyle based on faction, I don't mean their racials I mean their duties in premade bgs change depends on the faction they play on, since paladins are the superior/tankier healers who never goes oom they end up replacing priests as the defacto defensive healers in bgs which leaves priests with the offensive healer role, but for horde this role is reversed, since Rshamans are meh for premade bgs ele/resto hybrid take on the offensive roles and priests become the defensive healers, so people rolling priest for pvp might want to consider based on their preferred playstyles.
---
\-Warlocks being an underused class back in 2005 will not mean the same thing in classic, even now on private servers warlock populations are nearly twice what they were in vanilla, people simply learned how good they are and now everyone wants to play them, people expecting to be rare snowflakes just by picking locks are going to be disappointed.
---
\- Mages actually want to aoe grind when servers are too populated to abuse the dynamic respawns not because they are ahead of the pack, if you are on an average server pop without much dynamic respawns I'd stick to normal questing.
---
Sure! I'd love to learn more about mages. I spent the vast majority of my time in classic as a holy paladin and some as a hunter, so I know nothing really about the other classes. I am trying to read up on some shaman info too as that's what I will be maining.
---
I always knew it was time for bed when I noticed a sharp uptick of Xiaos running around.
---
I wish Alliance could also attack gnomes on pvp servers for honor.
---
I wish Tauren could "loot" a Gnome's corpse and wield it as a 2H Mace.

Please this must reach every blizzard developer

&gt; I don't remember the name but I remember that it was a big troll that protected that GY.
---
Korrak! Infamous on private servers for the number of people who'd stop attacking and rush back to middle to kill him, resetting an hour's of progress.
---
&gt;No memories of Syndicate though, where did they hang out?
---
I think they were on the eastern side of the map, but don't take my word for it. 
---
Landmines removal and the major map/npc changes happened in the first overhaul which was 1.8, barely three months after it was released, so very few people actually got to play that initial version (though of course 80% of this subreddit claim they did)
---
Idk about you, but I had mostly abandoned retail until recently. Now I’m primarily playing to keep relationships with friends that currently play + try to gold make as much as I can in order to buy wow tokens, and max out my game time for when classic actually does come out, if by September I don’t even need to pay for game time for a year, that will be amazing, even though it’s not much, it will still feel great. 
---
$11 btw
---
Days, not hours. My mistake for the typo! 
---
Real talk, both games are great in their own way.  
---
Wow classic is much more social and requires teamwork The classic world feels immense because the pace is slower. Plus, there is constant character progression (from level 2 until decked in naxx gear).  In classic you are a small fish in a big ass pond.
---
Retail is more like a single player game with multiplayer option.  You can experience 95 percent of the content without ever talking to another person.  Some people (myself included) dont mind this aspect.  The game itself is much quicker pace and much more forgiving of mistakes.  Its sort of like d2/d3 in that much of the game is hack and slash.  All classes and specs are viable.
---
Being impressed when seeing a mount. 
---
Granted. Gnome maces are the only weapon taurens can use, though, and cannot be repaired.
---
NOOOOooooo...!
---
&gt; but I do want additional content
---
https://i.redd.it/6fikcs0lnyj21.jpg
---
Some raid buffs had a cool down (dragonslayer was 6 hoursish iirc) before they would give the buff out again.
---
World buffing on private servers has become very much the norm, in retail vanilla we world buffed for our first few loatheb kills, and then for sapph / KT. 
---
Goodluck with the gold aim! I wish I still had relationships in game to keep alive because it's the main thing stopping me from playing. Sadly most either have stopped playing themselves over the years, or went full raid mode while I've dropped out of raiding. 
---
Ah fairs. I always wanted to be apart of one of those "reroll" guilds that capped but never got the chance to. With classic coming out I feel like most people who would be interested are waiting for that.
---
The biggest problem with 1.12 AV is that Alliance noobs recap SH graveyard, the next biggest is AFKers, after that it's turtles at IB, which can be fixed by noobs not capping SH graveyard.
---
Lol who is downvoting you
---
Well. Yes. It’s instanced content. Which by design goes to its own server instance. 
---
The same way every zone does, in a shared setup. Since each shard is a separate instance.
---
Thanks! Will do! :D 
---
Drop them a sms that you are picking the game up again.
---
I know i am. 
---
Also, i am married and have a kid. 
---
She will learn how to farm gold for dad.
---
Hundreds of hours in 5 years isn't a stretch.... Even if you only played one hour a day it would be over a thousand hours.
---
Only I *really* experienced Classic WoW, it has to be tailored for *me*!
---
Mark my words, you are dead wrong. Blizzard has stated they want an authentic experience and they have stated sharding will be used in a limited way. Stop fear mongering for christs sake. Dont you guys have anything better to do than go around to every thread and say how Blizz is intentionally planning to fuck up their game.
---
I know this is a technical test - but who won? lol
---
Imagine denying reality because it doesn’t align with your opinions. 
---
They stated that shardinng would be used in a limited way at launch if it is used at blizzcon. Im not going to link it but it isn’t difficult to find.
---
Yeah I know the stun resist is big, but I like Tauren, and the HP and Warstomp are enough to offset the orc racials for me. 
---
When it comes to Mage however WOTF is great, and trolls don’t really come close, other than being played less as mages, and having berserking.
---
Thanks though!
---

When im playing alliance i refer to horde as the animal faction 
---
When i play horde i refer to the alliance as soylliance 
---
I was honestly surprised by that statement.  I love playing my lock; it was my main in the beginning, and it's going to be the first class I get to 60 come classic.  Plus yeah, while leveling most people that aren't rogues won't fuck with you too much.
---
No, guilds do split runs (20/20 instead of 40, sometimes lower) for the weapons mainly and sometimes T2 pieces. The bags are the last thing on their priority. 
---
Currently job searching haha. Also trying to finally put out some of my music. I know Classic is gonna suck up a lot of my time once it drops. Gotta get productive now.
---
Granted but Gnomeregan becomes the major capital city for the Alliance with AH instead of Ironforge.
---
Hah, I know right? But I’m getting a 144hz 2k monitor, and want as high fps as possible, with max settings, with as good fps as possible in main cities and in big raids, so with all that, I think it will actually still be demanding for modern systems. Obviously it is overkill for solo questing and stuff like that, but I’m fine with overkilling it, I am so hyped.
---
Playing Diablo 3 like an addict 
---
South shore or western plaguelands I imagine
---
BTW which 3 fights is it?  I know Onyxia and Nefarian but I can't think of what the last one is ... does Sapphiron have a fear?
---
It’s settled, Tauren.
---
Yeah you’re probably right. However I’m trying to avoid private servers for now so I’m not burned out by the time Classic releases
---
Wtf is wrong with your Ts?
---
And some instanced content might have most ressources assigned to it. Hence the difference. 
---
I was thinking the same thing about joining a guild. Honestly I think it would be more fun to clear the content with a bunch of fellow noobs than to be carried by a bunch of Pserver guys. It would feel like more of a new game imo. I guess it depends on whether you want to push realm first and clear naxx a few times or just do stuff more casually.
---
It's not a normal chest. It's in the cave towards Ravenholdt Manor east of Tarren Mill.

**in my personal opinion**
---
In the kingdom far, far away donkey.
---
The edgelord kids always go for the things with edges... I guess that explains. Horde "architecture" is literally edges...
---
Is that what you expect of the Vanilla experience ? " The easier the better, the faster the better. " :(
---
Master Builder’s Shirt is the best because it is a green item. I refuse to wear pleb white items, it is not befitting.
---
Undead has nothing to do with it to be fair,It's not the race to be precise its just a small portion of rogues, the same thing happens to horde in stv , and to say all rogues are like that wouldn't be true, I've seen many lvl 60 rogues just pass by me while I was leveling alts, and this doesn't apply to a specific class either, not all the gankers/campers are undead male rogues ganking in stv, just a particular kind of player , race/class doesn't mean much, you only remember rogues because they surprise you :)

I'm going to give you the benefit of a doubt and just say you're ignorant.

No shit, hundreds of hours is nothing.
---
This makes no sense you dribbler
---
Plus, it is really benefical to level a second character to 35. If you get bored of the warrior prior to that, just toss him into an inn then casually level him up to that level with rested XP. 
---
Why 35? You can learn artisan level of professions. 
---
Why is that so great? Some professions have long (few days) cooldown on making certain items, like alchemists can transmute, tailors can create magical cloth. These are highly valued items which can be made really quickly (under 5 minutes) and give you a good passive income.
---
Playing Overwatch and Civ 6, mainly.
---
You should lend some of that optimism to BfA servers.
---
Maybe then with whatever secret optimism sauce Classic will be drenched in, BfA can also handle 80 people on screen at the same time without lagging.
---
Technically it's the Argent Quartermaster Hasana. 
---
But you gotta have some serious guts to utilize her. Chillwind Camp would be the closest safe one. 
---
I mean I love me some vanilla and will be playing Classic, but let's not pretend that it's going to be "popular", because it really won't. MMOs are already a niche market; super time consuming and grindy MMOs are even more of a niche market.
---
- Pay to win and adminstration favoritism/corruption
---
- Bugs and incorrect mechanics
---
- Too many people
---
- Elitism

dont forget as a hunter you can make Thorium ammo with engineering

[Book "Evil Soothsaying for Dummies"](https://www.wowhead.com/object=177226/book-evil-soothsaying-for-dummies) was added in patch 1.11.1.5462. It allowed you to drop your specialization. I find it very unlikely that it would make it's way into Classic (until late lategame). 
---
Playing on p-servers, of course.  Re-familiarizing myself with quests, leveling paths and good farming locations.
---
I am the same :) It's tempting to just go do it now but I'm holding off so it'll be more enjoyable for me on release of classic. I haven't played anilla since vanilla so it'll be like re-learning the game again for me. Don't want to spoil it.
---
Link your music!
---
Also could you find a job for me too? D:
---
Which means the problem can and will be solved by simply changing some parameters in a Teraform config file. 
---
Yeah but I don't trust blizz
---
As a warrior you can take on 3 very different roles: 
---
You can be the main tank who is the most geared and usually most tryhard player. He needs all the consumables and is the most taxing role. 
---
But if you like tanking, you can be an OT as well. Those tank the addons or the trash mobs and do not need to be so focused as the MT. 
---
Then you can also just dps which is btw something a warrior really excels at.
---
I'm ready for every caster dps to be wearing [Spellweaver's Turban](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=22267) right out the gate until BWL is released and they can roll on Mish'undare (which is only about ~13 sp equivalent better than this dungeon loot).
---
Right like Kara was supposed to be in classic how dope would it be to have Kara!!
---
Just play them all!  I'm planning on rolling alts up for each profession from the get-go so I can feed them spare mats.
---
But on that note...does anyone have any idea what the per-realm character limit is going to be?
---
Hope you don't run with me I'm reserving that in my runs.
---
This is acceptable. 
---
Granted, a specific Tauren male NPC now exists that is 5x smaller than the average Gnomish battle chicken.
---
Ghazghkull Thraka approves of this.
---
I like it. 
---
Yes we can’t stress this enough to people who are rolling warrior in classic. Don’t expect to dps in dungeons while leveling. You’re possibly the worst dps to choose from while leveling, not because your dps is necessarily bad (which it isn’t), but because you don’t have any cc or relevant buffs (battle shout LUL).  Once your 60 fury dps in dungeons is good if you’re geared for quick runs. Whilst leveling and at 60, Just throw on a shield and tank, and you will be able to call the shots, res gear or sellables, and if people don’t like it you can just find another dps. 
---
Gnomonokos
---
Well, reading posts on reddit... 
---
I want to be able to have my profession window open at the same time as the AH window. 
---
It isnt, but if you motherfuckers would try and understand what I am saying instead of downvoting every fucking post you dont understand, maybe you would get my point too.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKfS5zVfGBc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKfS5zVfGBc) this fucking video I spent looking for like a hour. Damn haven´t heard it for couple of years definitely.

:D My t key is broken, so I coypasted one t and copy + v them in. Saw that I had a link in them when I was about to send the reply and thought "Eh, good enough"
---
For warrior you can make gold at endgame doing DME jump runs combined with mining will net you nice gold. Also you can tank Strat love and res the first Orb or res all Orbs and res sellables. You will find groups because high 50 levelers will want the gear and quests in there, while you get the gold. 
---
Warrior leveling imo isn’t boring, it’s very engaging if you use hamstring kiting method. You’re always moving and attacking. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avd9l9/what_would_you_like_to_be_done_with_the_game_some/

At the time of me linking this:  
---
43% want more content added in the spirit of vanilla.  
---
40% want a TBC port.  
---
17% want for the game to remain unchanged.
---
83% for content after Naxx. I'd say that's a vast majority.
---
So true, the main alliance faction literally had a missing leader. 
---
I wish you could tame Druids in cat/ bear form
---
How dare you! I will continue to watch every season of The Office (Excluding the Robert California ones) repeatedly until Classic finally launches.
---
It is good for dungeons and quests. Instead of solving wait times with cross realm bullshit, just give us some more people on the server and it won't be a big problem.
---
If Nostalrius and other private servers coped with large populations then Blizzard should be able to figure out something.
---
Dire Maul*
---
Dire Maul
---
Or just drinking.
---
&gt;We're talking about paladin though, not a stealth class.
---
Are you a complete idiot or what? Here is an exact quote of what you said.
---
&gt;Here's the big one - if a **feral druid** doesn't spam pummelers all the time, his DPS doesn't go completely down the shitter thanks to powershifted shred. However, your character gets almost all his DPS boosted by haste. This means that if you take away your pummeler, you're doing roughly 40% less DPS.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Even if you decided to be useless on trash and just spammed pummeler on bosses, a Naxx clear with an average 2 minute boss kill would require 20 pummelers. And even if you managed to do the Gnomeregan run before the instance reset limitation timer (12 minutes - I doubt that considering you can't stealth past mobs), getting 20 pummelers would take on average 10 hours.
---
**YOU** were the one that brought up feral druids and pummelers. And since Paladins dont even use Pummelers at any point in the game for any spec, you have a to a special kind of idiot to think that somehow the Paladins ability to farm pummelers is relevant to anything here. Complete no brain response from you.
---
Wait for classic. The current game is like playing with cheats on.
---
Literally I did not see this and was asking for proof cause I hadn’t been able to find any. So thank you kind sir 
---
Yup, forgot about networking, it reduced network load on client but same thing will reduce networking load on server by big margin. 
---
Lets say 500 players are in same area, each client receives for example 1KB of data for each player. (500KB totally)
---
Example: Server has to send 499^2 * 5KB worth of data (levels, name, items etc) to clients in that specific area. (Its little bit lower but for sake of example) Which will result in 1245MB worth of data, if you reduce data send for each client even by 1KB it will reduce amount of data sent by 250MB which is a lot.
---
AV was always boring garbage pve afkfest.  it's literally the epitome of nostalgia goggles 
---
Depends on the druid spec as well. And a competent druid will typically be able to escape, regardless of spec.
---
Was he banned or silenced? The video title says 'silenced' but I cba watching him to find out.
---
People who have never played the game before often fall in love with the abilities of being a mage. They will always wish they weren't as fragile as glass but they always love their abilities.
---
People who play Warlocks as their first class always have an undying love for their lock.
---
I've watched players play Warrior as their first class then go mage out of frustration. Likewise, I played a priest my first time around and LOVED being a prot warrior.
---
No one ever complains about being a hunter. Although I hate the idea of maintaining a pet and would rather most of my power be in a single entity.
---
No shame in being a novice player. You learn all about the game as you go and interact with other players - which makes it much more of an adventure. You can listen to other people bitch about their class or you might find traits you wish you had which lead you to re-roll something you really enjoy. As long as you're having fun!
---
not all 3 shaman specs are truly viable for pvp, ele is much better than the other 2 in every regard.
---
It's out of date information.
---
Pat's PVP Video was my all time favorite [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok). A high warlord Tauren and a song that made middle school me feel something special. 
---
To get to SM you would fly to south shore, walk all the way to SM. Yes even past the undercity. Surprisingly this has always been “safer” to me rather than flying and going through WPL. The reason being, mobs are so high level if you don’t have a mount you’ll certainly aggro them, also horde is always around that area, I’ve noticed.  I’ve always stuck with south shore and it was fine 90% of the time. When you get to SM there’s usually horde parties and even level 60s so it’s really a game of getting your party there and into the instance. You’ll be running for the closest one not to get ganked, but it’s part of the fun! :P
---
“Master of none”
---
Biggest issue is... bigness.  Those Tauren were so easy to click target u get a lot of attention on BGs. Just a thought 
---
If there's nothing I eyeroll harder at, its a group with a Warrior, Paladin and Druid in it looking for a tank/healer.
---
"I'm dps" is seen way too fucking much lol
---
Paladin's blessings make both PvE and PvP easier for Alliance so I expect to see 55-60% Alliance on every server, pretty much like it is nowadays on private servers.
---
Haven't had any luck finding a guild on my own, so I figured I'll post here.
---
Region: **NA (EST)**
---
Server: **RP-PVP**
---
Faction: **Horde**
---
Focus: **Raiding/PvE**
---
I've got a decent amount of experience leveling on private servers, and have been in raiding guilds through TBC/Cata/MoP/WoD/Legion. I'm willing to fill whatever class is necessary, Hunter pref but I have zero problem playing anything but warr/shaman.
---
For future reference on the classicdb website if you navigate database&gt;zone&gt;continent&gt;map you can bring up markers for repair/general vendors that are colour coded Ally/Horde/Neutral.
---
Paladins: Debuff remove all day in raids. Only really healed on bosses back in the day If i remember right.
---
Bad bot
---
I came from Elune (NA - PvE) and it was quite unbalanced in favor of Alliance. I truly hope that it is more balanced this time through as I still plan on being on a PvE server.

Resto Shaman feels so bad in PvP
---
Lets say player info is about 5KB. For client its nothing, for servers its nothing right?
---
Lets say there are 500 people in area. Server sends 500*5KB worth of data to a player. He receives 2500KB worth of data, its still nothing. But server has to actually send about 499^2*5KB worth of data which is a lot - 1245MB, imagine you could reduce player data size by 1KB (doesnt seem hard right?) Well that would reduce load on server by 250MB if we are talking about that area with 500 players.
---
Me too!

---
Dartol's Rod of Transformation
---
It's a quest item in Ashenvale I believe (maybe Felwood?). Basically you finish half of a questline and you get an item that transforms you into a Furbolg. If you hand in the quest though, you lose the item, so just don't finish the quest and you keep it forever. My 120  Hunter on live servers still has one, but the quest was removed in Cata. It lasts 3 minutes and has a 1 minute cooldown, so you can eseentially perma Furbolg. 
---
Pre dire maul you absolutely can. After Dire Maul, HoJ is still pretty good for Nightfall.
---
Granted. Warlocks can now steal a hunters soul and summon them as a demon.
---
Yea, they just have to bash -&gt; faerie fire, travel form into a root, and the rogues done. Probably don't even need bash with natures grasp.
---
Context: 
---
Not the best player. Duelist in Arena, 2100RBGs and I've done Mythic/Heroic raiding all through WoWs lifespan. 
---
The two classes i'm considering are:
---
* Druid
---
* Mage
---
Druid because it's what i've played since BC. The idea of giving it a try in Classic sounds fun. Being able to use all my forms and spells in PvP is really enjoyable. 
---
My concerns / questions:
---
1. How hard is it to gear Feral Tank? 
---
2. Outside of healing are Druids taken to 5man/Raid content?
---
3. Is Balance ever.. I don't want to say Viable but ever not a hindrance? I'm fine being a bit behind in terms of % dps just because of my class. 
---
4. How far behind hybrid talent builds from pure talent builds? Will I have to respec constantly (doesn't sound like a good idea) or can I get away with healing dungeons/raids with a hybrid build?
---
Mage because I've never mained one. The idea of making food and water for people as well as providing Portals sounds really fun. Hearing that mage has a high skill ceiling for pvp is also exciting as I think I'm mechanically decent. 
---
1. Is tailoring required for PvE Gearing? Is Engineering Required for PvP? 
---
2. How difficult is it to gear a Mage? In the sense that I'd assume in a raid setting they will be very popular. Compared to a less played class or spec. 
---
3. In PvP can you overcome things like lower health pools before being geared up through mechanical skill? Or do I just have to accept i'm going to die often and it will be out of my hands for the most part?
---
4. Is there a talent build that will let me raid and PvP or will I have to be consistently respecing? 
---
Thanks! 
---
Spending too much time learning just enough web programming to make a tool for Classic that will not be valuable past launch day crowds.
---
The only code change they made in BFA was adding multi-threading support. Something that should have been added to the game a decade ago, also implementing said feature broke a ton of shit on the backend and resulted in the horrible lag that started cropping up around 8.1. I don't think this is a coincidence.
---
because manchildren have the louder voice and guess what faction they play
---
**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

A good memory I have of classic was playing my friend's decked out warrior in BWL gear. Zoned into an AV that was going on for over 20 hours. Just started going to town on people cuz I had a dedicated healer, he was playing my paladin. Soon other healers start to take notice and heal me too. I was literally a raid boss smashing everything in sight and being topped off constantly. A good 40 minutes later we pushed them back and killed their leader. Finished with something ridiculous like 150 killing blows and 4 deaths. I was getting whispers telling me how awesome I was lol.

**&lt;Pertento&gt;** 
---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
** *Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere* **
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun 20:00 - 24:00 CET (with Monday an extra raid day for progression)

3k I think.
---
I really don't think it has to do with increased toxicity-all of the things I pointed out are systemic of a community that doesn't trust the game. Give it time, give it consistency....and hope that blizzard doesn't fuck things up....and things will revert eventually.
---
That one use ever 10 second invulnerability potion.
---
The star of many videos about turning a 0.5% wipe into a kill.
---
Mine is still chilling in the bank since it's hard to come across that perfect moment to justify it.
---
Objectively I think you are wrong, sub numbers are heavily implied to be around 2 million, the lowest they've been in a while.

&gt; players do something unexpected, like when they host a 80 player PvP battle
---
In a 40v40 BG?
---
How is that unexpected? Is my math that rusty?
---
I love when people just make up their own facts on reddit.
---
I wish the Alliance and Horde races could switch factions - I want to MC Hammer (Orc) dance with my Alliance friends.
---
Zerker is on 30, but fears are not.
---
Summoning stones, mailbox (confirmed new) guild bank, yeah I do remember that original dungeon group finder. Plenty of things just make sense, but they're being illegitimized by memes.
---
So let's see, 500 x 500 x 3B = 0,7MB or 0.05% of data savings. That is ignoring compression, which is highly effective here since the added 3B are just zeroes and contain literally no information. 
---
My point still stands, it doesn't matter, never did, and never will. 
---
But then you miss out on all of the fun of re-leveling
---
 Oh cool. What's the tool going to be? Got any previews?
---
Why are you so cute man?
---
4 seconds is barely an inconvenience because we have to not attack for 5 seconds before we restealth again anyway.
---
As a druid I'm always getting whispers asking or kinda begging me to tank a dungeon for them. I had no idea Druids were sought after for that. 
---
I saw a rogue stealthing up to a group of low characters. I fairy fired him, everyone saw him. Rooted him, and they took a while but they all dog piled on him. 
---
0% chance this happens 
---
It is known.
---
This. There are so many more effects and calculations done is such a short amount of time. Sure people remember 100 ppl at Southshore or xroads but that was 100 people with shirt gear and about 4 spells and no buffs and loads more client side that was exploitable. 
---
The video is 80 max level characters, with spells, talents, all manner of xmog effects, pets, azerite traits, trinkets etc etc. It's just not comparible. 
---
Tagging off of this comment, I think OP’s post over-valued Hunters a tad. While they are pretty much the best class for solo-leveling, they cannot solo every quest, and they scale terribly into T3 (while warlocks scale better than nearly everyone else). Hunters are just above feral Druids in Naxx for dps, (which is about 1/2 the dps of mages and warriors) but hunters provide almost no raid utility.
---
That said, my two classes will probably be Hunter and Druid.
---
Have you guys every played pservers there's a whole guild dedicated to 24/7 ganking lakeshire. There are lots of people playing for fun and I group up literally almost every quest...
---
I've played on 3 different ones, not that I can name them here, and they all had similar amounts of reactionary garbage, from casual jokes about anti-blackness, immigration, misogyny, and transphobia to laissez faire statements of white-supremacy and anti-semitic conspiracy theories. It's not just arguments in public chat, it's a pervasive aura of bigotry. It's in the guilds, too - on one server which I spent a decent amount of time on raiding, I scoped out several guilds and went on pug MC runs to see what the atmosphere of different guilds was like and joined the one which was more "infamous" for having a guild leader who was "PC". I still saw people using slurs in guild chat and people being sexist in chat without a hint of humour or "irony". Again, the retail community can be awful, but it is far less all-encompassing and guilds often advertise themselves on the fact that they don't tolerate these attitudes.
---
Maybe your super special server doesn't have this problem. I honestly doubt it. 
---
Grinding rep and finally finishing my garrison. 
---
Im gonna be using a rogue, so maybe not that bad!
---
Thats 2 million people who are paying for a sub. Those people prefer the game as is, otherwise they would have unsubscribed a LONG time ago, like most of us did. 
---
I definitely want to play on RP-PvP. Hopefully they only have one for the US so it stays populated. 
---
With add-ons like Gatherer, all the spawn points are known and it's very easy to establish farming routes with little previous interaction in the zone. I would rather have some sort of dynamic system of spawn points , so that it's less predictable and encourages more time interacting in the zone. I know a lot of people just want to farm efficiently - vanilla was not meant to provide an extensive supply of every resource so your guild can clear MC/BWL/AQ40 the day it comes out. or provide the ability to have full consumables on every pull.
---
I liked the long drawn out battles in AV. They let me relive the pre-BG Tarren Mill battles. It is fun to have a line vs line mass battle where people are sitting right out of hunter range, seeing which side will make a push. As a melee character you had to play smart and make coordinated attacks.
---
That being said I would support any improvements to AV to make it a fun and strategy based 40v40 BG. I think most people can agree that AV leaves a lot to be desired and I always thought that it was Alliance favored in layout.
---
Depending on the time zones maybe; honestly I either work 6am-2pm or 2pm-10pm, so I need to raid around 1030-11pm-1am or early on weekends. Might have to make my own guild but I won’t have he time to lead lol &gt;.&lt;
---
Maybe a west coast guild. 
---
&gt;There are usually people advertising runs with "sellables reserved" or all BoE's reserved for the tank, etc. I always ignore these, but I'm sure there are people who go along with it because they don't mind or it's convenient, etc.  
---
&gt;They can only do this if the community has need for their service - if more people/tanks are doing it then the "reserved" people will not fill their groups.  
---
&gt;Of course, if people do this they have to guarantee a solid run, otherwise there is little incentive for people to even consider it.  
---
&gt;As for those runs with specific drops reserved, what's the point of going if they want to reserve items that are not BoP - it's the same as if they were charging gold to be invited the group. I'm not going to pay someone (or pass up the chance at a valuable drop, which is the same thing) to be able to join a pug group. I'd rather get in a decent guild and clear it with guildies. If items are reserved in a guild, it's usually because someone needs the item for progression &amp; that's what these pug/reserved groups are probably doing - why should I pay some other guild with time, effort &amp; possibly gold if it will mostly help THEM out?
---
I'm concerned about people's knowledge of what a pair is now.
---
How dare you sir!
---
Inb4 Taurens have to spend all their gold to travel to the gnome starting area each day just for usable weapon.
---
I'm wondering if they will keep the community size to 2500. I'd rather see something aroung 4-5000, but obviously there is an issue with farming resources.
---
It would go away if you weren't lazy and made your own group. You should be rewarded for putting in the effort to make a group because most people don't want to.
---
You should play Tauren warr, so we could have more tank players so I don't have to roll one.
---
When I first started I felt that Alliance always get the better end of any patch that came through.  Less so in Vanilla, although they did have more flushed out and better designed stuff.  Stormwind and Ironforge felt more polished to me, trams between the cities was an amazing concept I was jealous of.  Stuff like AV advantages, there was a big list that I've forgotten nearly all of over the last decade.
---
Going forward, into BC, Wrath, and Cata where I quit.  Humans got a crazy OP PvP trinket as a racial, Stormwind got a massive harbor added to it, I'm sure there was a lot more but I can't remember.  Anyway, that's what sparked animosity for myself and my friends.  It could have just been a 'grass is greener' way of thinking.  But I didn't like them because I felt Blizzard favored them.
---
id add that: 
---
- hunters have the biggest range in the game
---
- hunters are extremely strong in wpvp (in my opinion 1#)
---
I wish the shitty looking gear stopped at level 55 and from then on it looked more intimidating and interesting
---
I wish I didn't go OOM every time I give a Fort buff
---
Don't sell yourself short. Warlocks ramp up pretty well from m BWL and onwards. The more locks u have the miss dmg u do up to I think 5 locks. Throw in a priest with shadowweaving and the damage is really good.
---
Granted. Because of this, the female Tauren begin to take male gnomes as mates.
---
The resultant offspring of this union is worse than the cataclysm, and will be the raid bosses of the extra content that will be released after naxx.
---
Nvm, you need rep
---
Imagine playing a fantasy game where you could choose to play with the faction that has talking cows, rotting corpses, green space people or cannibal hippies, but instead you play a human, smaller human, even smaller human or long eared hippie. 
---
That's why.
---
Mage's rotation is not only frostbolt, stop with the confusion. If you're only casting frostbolts whole raid, then you're a bad mage. You rotation will include: frostbolts, fireblast, cone of cold, blizzard, decurses, ice blocks, arcane explosions, evocation etc etc. Add to that managing your mana on bosses and on trash before pulls.
---
&gt; Problems only arise when players do something unexpected, like when they host a 80 player PvP battle on infrastructure that's designed to handle PvP encounters no larger than 15 vs. 15. 
---
80 player battles shouldn't be "unexpected" considering they still support Epic Battlegrounds, and War Games such as the one here. This wasn't a WPvP encounter with wild unpredictable numbers. It was 40v40 in a instance. 
---
Those other people you're looking up to also just want to veg out and play some WoW. :)
---
i guess that answers that 
---
The game has been able to handle 80 people in more expansions than not, not really a secret sauce, just take ANY version of the servers of ANY expansion except BFA. 
---
Thanks! How lucky that i posted on monday lol
---
 RP is always a niche in MMORPGs (ironically).
---
I think it has to do with the fact that most people played their first RPG on a PC/console and never really had the pen &amp; paper experience of roleplaying.
---
Also going into RP in a game who’s lore you don’t know can be an ordeal since you need to read up on a lot of lore and some find it boring; sometimes the lore is poorly written as well.
---
I’m into RP, especially in WoW. If they will have RPPvP servers that’s where i’ll land.
---
Looking for a casual raiding guild for my friends and I to join. Looking for PvE on US servers for Alliance. There are four of us that will join together. We’re all levelers/raiders.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Its world of roguecraft tbh. Those movies were made when rogues were unstoppable killing machines, but as other classes caught up in gear and had their talents revamped rogues just remained kinda the same. And hence fell a lot in power.
---
On 5 mans , literally who cares you can clear everything with whatever comp
---
Same with MC and ZG
---
It is only on BWL and up that meme specs are not very useful anymore 
---
That is 75% data reduction for one variable.
---
Saving just items of dude in database. 200 items per dude (storing item id), using int64 instead of int32 =&gt; 12800bytes =&gt; 12.8KB. 100M characters.
---
1 280 000 000KB =&gt; 1.28TB instead of 640GB. Still not worth it? You are talking about single variable, lets talk about 100 variables using wrong data type per player in storage, in networking, in memory, in CPU time. Still not worth?
---
Depends on many things. For example, if you play Alliance the forsaken will definitely try to fuck with you and world pvp was never about honorable, equal duels anyway.
---
I also played Horde on Destromath in vanilla and can also say that I remember it being pretty split between DM and VC, and no matter what you called it people would always ask what dungeon.
---
I’ve only seen what you described rarely. I’m talking about specific bop items reserved. Usually pre bis. 
---
You guys are thinking way too much into this.  Just play the game and have fun. 
---
I love RP. World PvP is my jam. If there is an RP-PvP server, you bet your sweet ass I am rolling on it. I notice the people on RP servers are typically more quality, even if they aren't RPers.
---
As a horde, I see no downside -- as we can port directly there from BB.
---
This is a buff (Wrong game but applies)
---
You’re not the arbiter or what is fun/not fun for people. If a premise likes to rush AV in under 10 minutes and that’s fun to them that’s fine. If attaining all the prebis fear in AV is fun for them then let them. 
---
Granted. However, every time you shift into a stag Hagrid’s voice says, “Yer a wizard, Harry.” And the theme song from Harry Potter is hummed on repeat while in travel form by Helen Keller.
---
Well yeah, if I see someone sitting at 1/3 health, they're going to eat it, I don't care who they are.
---
\*\*Real Men of Genius\*\* \[Horde\] / \[NA\] / \[9p-1a CST days TBD\]
---
Real Men of Genius aims to be a cohesive, active guild that clears all content in short order. 
---
The guilds that actually accomplish their goals are those that have a mixture of cohesion, stability and performance. It does no good to kill Ragnaros on week 1 of release and have the fastest MC clear if your guild falls apart after two months of a raid leader's autistic screeching. Needless to say, a guild also isn't going to go very far if they can't perform well enough to clear content. In RMoG, we intend to foster a community that avoids both of these pitfalls. 
---
Goals: 
---
\- clear all content (quickly)
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement, not raidlogging
---
If you want to have fun, clear content, be a top guild on the server and not just raidlog, then join us here: [https://discord.gg/S7ECnFj](https://discord.gg/S7ECnFj)
---
p.s. This guild was started by a couple of world pvp enthusiasts. If the real end-game in your mind is asserting your dominance over the opposite faction, this is the guild for you.
---
The biggest issue I can foresee on PvP-RP server will simply be the population will be so lopsided Alliance Horde that hardly any PvP will happen at all.
---
Then role whatever side seems to have less and dominate :P
---
Not all of them are like this indeed, but many are, especially gankers. And I don't remember any UD male rogue specifically, because it happens much more often than with any other classes.
---
However, I do remember getting killed by female troll warrior and dwarf priests, because it was kind of unique thing in contrast to the things like male nelf hunters and UD rogues. People just like the aesthetics of certain class/race combination and find it cool to fit a specific purpose like ganks.
---
I hate touching these threads because people who don’t understand how this works don’t like hearing it might not be entirely Blizzard’s fault and rain downvotes.  My post has been bouncing from +15 to -8, and it’s not even controversial.  It’s literally just saying how server ticks work, nothing more.  Every MMO struggles with this, and unfortunately you can’t just throw money or hardware at it to fix it.  It’s a mathematical problem that has no solution. 
---
You could add that hunters are required for Tranq shots in MC/BWL/Naxx.
---
I'd love to see more guild adverts for RP-PvP. My experience has been that these servers attract a fun group of players with a healthy interest in wPvP on both factions.
---
Granted, but all their gargantuan battle chickens from the comment above will join the horde.
---
But you don’t need to RP, that’s the point. If anything it’s a filter to weed out negative people. 
---
If somebody wants to reserve a certain piece of gear, it's usually only a problem to others who might want it - this can be indirectly done by not inviting any other classes who might use it. Like being the only Mage who wants a weapon &amp; filling out the group with non-caster classes.
---
I think there's just a lack of RP interest in general.
---
Unfortunately, people keep glorifying the wrong aspects of RP servers so I can fully expect RPers to be the minority on their own server.  It will be loads of fun to constantly have my immersion broken and sessions trolled or crashed by players only there to play against noobs or enjoy like the mature community man.
---
If you're trying to avoid the RP then you should not be on an RP server.  duhhh
---
Granted, all Horde races are now in the Alliance, and all Alliance races are now in the Horde. 
---
I want dm patched so mages aren't farming 500g a day and destroying the economy. I want as few changes as possible but there's some parts of vanilla that I would hate to see brought back for classic.
---
Like in real life, people move on - if you re-connect with old friends, that's great but chances are good that you will be playing with a whole new set of friends.
---
Alliance is prettier.  Which means that alliance players may be choosing form over function.  Even though alliance characters are strong, if your choices come down to aesthetics or preferences you may opt against min/maxing in other areas.
---
I am leaning towards the warrior. I enjoy being a good tank, and people whisper you with invites. Especially in classic, where you can pride yourself as being a well known tank on your server.
---
AV is just poorly designed all around.
---
- you can do literally nothing and get rewarded out the ass as people fighting turn shit in. You get jack shit losing over and over in wsg by comparison. AV weekend makes it worse
---
- The pve elements are annoying, and I agree with those complaints. But even later on you win by ignoring the other team and winning the pve race.
---
- the rewards are too good. So you have a heavily pve centric bg that attracts pve centric players. People who tell at everyone to "let them win, honor is better that way" because they want their Don Julio ring.
---
AV is just a shit bg, and it is set up in a way to reward you more and more as you fight the other side less and less. 
---
Blizzard is in charge of every aspect of the gameplay.  They can't blame the players for the changes in the game.
---
They aren't as good as you think they are, basically. Highly competitive, and you have to be extremely try hard. Unless you want to play rogue to gank lowbies, undergeared players, or random people grinding with mobs on them, then you're probably gonna have a worse off time than nearly any other class, apart from a solo warrior.
---
Anything longer than 10 minutes and people go ape shit
---
[Here's a list](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/97i3zw/patchwerk_wednesday_alterac_valley/) of all the changes AV went through incase anyone is interested. 
---
&gt;But I also would not at all be surprised if Blizzard went with the 1.12 version.
---
That's probably what's going to happen, much to my chagrin (I think a mix of the patches would be best, I go into detail about that in my post)  as that's the data they have. I don't think they have to data on hand to do anything other than the version available in 1.12, but I could be mistaken. 
---
&gt; AV simply wasn't popular, and the PvP/PvE mix was the reason.
---
Eh, I mean, sort of. I feel as thought AV wasn't popular NOT because of the PvP/PvE mix, but because the game took forever and if you're trying to grind rank, you want fast games as fast games = more honor per hour. Even on holiday's (when those were introduced) people grinding for R14 would run WSG and AB because that was till more honor per hour than any/every AV game, even if you rushed to the end. AV also wasn't popular on my server (Arthas US) because the Alliance won 99% of the games, it's hard to have fun when you have no chance in hell of winning IMO, so a lot of people would fish or farm the PvE content which added to frustration of the people who were trying to actually play the game and it just left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. 
---
Will things be different this time around? Maybe, I think it'll be interesting to see how the modern gamer reacts to something like AV, even in its 1.12 status the games (if you're not zerging the boss) can take hours and I'm under the impression that's not something the modern gamer is used to. 
---
Nice list!
---
I'd add a few things.
---
**Mage**
---
- Portals. Saves travel time, and can be used to earn a quick coin. 
---
**Druid**
---
- Awesome while leveling. A good Druid can play any role in almost all dungeons. But the point still stands that if you want to tank in raids you're better off picking a warrior. 
---
- Travel form is fantastic. Sure it's no mount, but it's instant, usable in combat and you don't have to shift out of it when gathering herbs or skinning. It's convenient. 
---
- I hope you don't care about your gear, because you won't be seeing it 90% of the time. Though for some this is a good thing. 
---
The most important reason why I will play Rogue - stealth. Exploring on enemy territory feels so good with Rogue. Also love WPvP and ganking.
---
I'm hoping there's enough interest to at least justify a handfull of RP and RP-PVP servers in Vanilla. RP servers were have always been a niche and Classic will (maybe) have an even smaller population than retail, but I imagine there's still enough interest to warrant at least a few RP servers.
---
I really enjoyed rogue in PVP, you had a sense of "I need to get this combo right and stun lock this person or I'm going to have to reset", which always made for an adrenaline rush in PVP. I found that they are very good, if played well, and are somewhat gear dependent. You can have a lot of fun, but it depends what you want. Organized bgs will usually end up with you guarding flags, which can be boring. Great for WPVP, you can be a huge pain in the ass in STV.
---
Having played on different servers over the years, I've preferred RP servers even though I don't RP.  If i would decide play on a PVP server, I'd do RPPvP.
---
Your wish is granted, but the #nochanges crowd will be informed of where you live.

**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
I love Priest so much, but I've wanted to play something different when Classic drops. I've been flip-flopping every time I think about it in terms of what I want to choose. 
---
I didn’t say I was avoiding it, I stated you don’t need to do it. 
---
Mind giving me a brief explanation of the differences? I've only played the AV contained in private servers.
---
Can you post the git commits for the source code?
---
oh the huntard back on Nost who got it over me had literally no idea it was for melee - he only saw "attack power" and rolled need on it lol
---
Granted. Every time you strike an opponent with the mace the gnome farts the sound of a squeaky balloon
---
Awesome! Thanks for putting this together 
---
And yet another r/classicwow dweller who thinks World of Roguecraft is possible in 1.12
---
There is no way they just open new servers like that. You have to monitor the flow of new players and when there are enough you can open a new server. No one knows how that flow will look like this time around. This stuff works for pservers because they close down all the time.
---
Not to mention possible hits from meltdown/spectre, which impact VMs in particular
---
It’s called an event. Do something different than grinding mobs for two seconds. They will still be there when the crowds disperse.
---
I desperately want TBC, but I don't want to force people off of Vanilla.  The way that I see it, is if I want to play Star Craft, I can pick which expansion I want to play:  SC, SC:BW, SC2:WOL, SC2:HOTS, SC2:LOTV.  If I play WoW, all I get is live.
---
There are players who like live who still say "No Classic".  Then there are Classic players who say "No TBC".  If I say "give me TBC, but no Classic" then I'm just as bad as the two groups before me.
---
The good ways I see it working are:
---
1. Fresh TBC servers
---
2. Free transfers to a TBC server
---
3. Copies of the realms, where one copy stays Classic and the other goes TBC
---
4. A combination of #1, and either #2 or #3.
---
5. Progress the Classic servers to TBC, and then launch fresh Classic servers
---
I think the two worst things would be to NOT to TBC, or to force people off of Classic onto TBC.
---
You dont think the servers doing less per tick is going to impact how resources are used? What fantasy world do you live in.
---
Ehh, not sure how practical that is considering the buff isnt guaranteed and the chicken dies to almost any raid damage.
---
... i think we have enough space for at least one no change world ...
---
That makes it better.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/ 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

The general chat on the server I'm on is so toxic you'll either vaporize or become a supervillain if you're in there for more than it takes to find a group.  Even the character names are horribly unfiltered.
---
Did you play an RP server in vanilla?
---
Also am I wrong to think warlocks have the weak beginnings trope because of how horrible they were at launch and got progressive better over patches? Wouldn't it be different this time because classic is starting at 1.12
---
Improved Healthstone is how you guaranteed that 5 star review.
---
I just want a deadmines that properly spawns its pats.  
---
What are you even talking about? The longer numbers are just leading zeroes, a decent database won't even store them, the effect of switching from int32 to int64 isn't a doubling of the storage required at all, it's close to nothing. This isn't a processor pipeline, we don't need to actually put the padding in there.
---
I actually hate you.
---
Won’t happen
---
Just deal with it
---
I see no downside
---
Ironman btw
---
Don’t worry mr crowds scare me you will be able to level your lil toons when things clear up. You can always play retail while you wait. Plenty of exp for you to grab all the time and you can have a legendary solo quest line -_-
---
I wish you were right. You should be right. You're not right.
---
Dang why do you have to be EU! I have a group of about 25 right now, with nearly identical experience (multiglads/r1s/raiding) to you, but we are NA.
---
GL!
---
&gt; single player RPG
---
So literally not an MMO? Which means by your own definition, these are the people that ruined WoW. So their opinions are wrong, because their opinions are anti-MMO
---
Thanks for disproving yourself though.
---
That was definitely part of it. I started playing a week or so after launch alongside two friends playing a Mage and Rogue, and I was definitely known as the free honor kill until later patches. Deathcoil having a 10 or 15 minute cooldown was underwhelming to say the least.
---
Why are you explaining it as if I don’t know that?
---
Why guts?
---
but the whole point is people say certain things about vanilla wow were really bad for the game and should be changed too, and get told no because it's. still vanilla. it doesn't really matter how a vanilla player sees lfg, because they have vanilla and it's not for them, it's for people who play wotlk and were alright with lfg?
---
Mage:  You are a watercooler in 60.
---
Anyone saying "they aren't so good" wants to play rogue and is trying to have less competition for gear. Go for it!
---
It's weird, I love tanking, and I would totally roll one, and I hear I'm a rare breed - sadly, I just don't have the time to put in to being a warrior in a serious tanking role.
---
Ok, I'm no longer #nochanges
---
 **&lt;TBD&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild (working on a name, we are holding a March Madness style vote in Discord eventually), specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
We will use some form of DKP or EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
AV pretty much never has a straight 40 vs 40 battle. The map is too big and the objectives are too spread out. Which is why the video in the OP had to be organized outside the game.
---
That’s okay with me. I played WoW from release and had a great time on an RPPvP server. Had two 60s. You can hate me if that helps you sleep at night. I was in a female character only RP guild for a few months. 
---
Dang, sounds like you guys are gonna have a blast over there! Sounds amazing.
---
&gt; Hasana
---
Because Hasana is a NPC at the bulwark, a horde base / Questhub between Tirisfal and WPL. There are some high level hostile npcs, that will attack you. 
---
The only useful thing about dropping say gnomish engineering is after you create a gnomish death ray, as it doesn't require engineering or be even a gnomish engineer to use it! Its just BoP upon creation.
---
But leveling all the way back up to 225 to take on goblin engineering is a huge pita.
---
Rogue pvp is extremely overrated. It worked in vanilla because people were clueless and had no idea how to counter a rogue. But now they do. The days of mages not blinking out of full stun are long long gone. 
---
Hunters and warlocks can solo princess in Maraudon. It's also a reliable way of getting minerals and herbs (particularly ghost mushroons). If they're feeling especially industrious, they can sell runs to physical DPSers looking for their pre-BIS Blackstone Ring.
---
That is assuming that Mara is available on launch. And I don't see why it wouldn't tbh. The gear in there is hardly game breaking, unlike Dire Maul.
---
I wish Shamans were raid viable past Resto
---
I will be playing RP/PVP. It’s nice to see people making an effort to behave in a manner that is realistic to the world. Even if you don’t have a huge backstory and talk in your race’s accent/style to others, it’s still refreshing to play in a more realistic world. I plan on RPing a bit, enough to have fun and improve the world experience for others, but you don’t have to be hardcore to play on a RP server. 
---
You can read through my comment history and learn all about my WoW experience.
---
Do you usually try to invalidate others opinions by being dismissive?
---
Why do you assume that there is dynamic respawns in the game ?
---
I couldn\`t find anything official on the topic so I would guess it wont be.
---
Sounds funny 
---
Exactly. Just pick a human, and don’t be a dick! Easy. 
---
Sounny.

---
Making a bunch of false claims doesn't give your logic any footing.  If players have no desire to RP, then they shouldn't be flocking en mass to RP servers.
---
Back when I rolled my first character in 2004, I picked an RP realm because "Player vs. Player" sounded intimidating and "PvE" hardly less so. I didn't know what any of these really meant, so I was kind of confused but happy to find players communicating in full sentences with proper punctuation. Eventually I understood what "roleplaying" was, and actually got into it. So an accidental server choice introduced me to something that's been a fun hobby ever since.
---
I didn’t invalidate anything, all I did was ask a question. I’m not going to “read through” your history though. You’re exactly the kind of person I will be playing RP servers to avoid. Have a nice day. 
---
Same! And endlessly playing with the talent calculators to create new characters and seeing if I can build niche specs. Looking at spells for classes I’ve never played and reading about them. 
---
I’m also coming up with back stories and names for characters so that I can roll RP-PVP. 
---
Not sure what claims were false. Have a nice day. 
---
I'm an RPer, see you there while your griefing my sessions.  Thank god it's reportable.
---
It was both.
---
I still type with probable punctuation and grammar when I can in all the games I play. It’s a nice thing to see. 
---
The burden of proof is on you.  People that don't RP should not be on RP servers.
---
There are items that won't be replaced until a new tier comes out.
---
Hunter no contest, your pet can solo people until raid gear and they don't require near the macros and micromanaging lock does
---
It's really good if it works like in vanilla in which it squawked even out of combat.
---
Also from wowhead it appears to be shieldable: " Battle Chicken is immune to healing. But not to PW:Shield (can make him last longer). "
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=10725#comments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10725#comments)
---
What this sub doesn't seem to realize is that due to patch progression, regional release schedules, and game knowledge, it is impossible to not change anything or 'change the fewest things'.
---
Add dot time to the end of your stealth timer. 6 seconds + 4 secs + another 6 seconds to drop. Will need some testing but I think it can be used.
---
Yeah, the battle chicken is amazing. Does push back and 5% AS buff for 4 minutes. BIS when it's up for any autoattacker.
---
get a load of this guy
---
to any non-rpers who are considering - we're happy to have you here as long as you're not a dick
---
Granted, Elemental is now also a healing spec.
---
That's likely the reason there aren't many Warlocks: In endgame raiding you are a summon bot and a healthstone/shadowbolt dispenser.
---
He's saying most of the changes (including bad ones that have lead to WoW being basically a single player game and not an MMO) have been asked for by players, ergo doing everything players want is stupid. 
---
Sounds quite good and realistic, shame that you want to start early evenings
---
Think of Modern wow as a ecoboost mustang and classic wow as a 1965 mustang.  Which one would you rather have ? 
---
Keep in mind this is in the mindset of overthinking a problem:  
---
Considering the high possibility of overcrowding at a starting area, I wanted to figure out how to escape the mayhem to another area while avoiding hostile mobs, as to not die (when I should really be killing stuff for xp). So, the tool is to make maps with spawn locations of hostile mobs, drawn big enough to pretend it's aggro range.  
---
I posted about it here, but it's still a work in progress:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/av9v8o/noncompete_clause/
---
Yeah but #nochanges? No changes... okay, no changes :) 
---
skinner_saying_pathetic.bmp
---
Yep, as a Warrior you can tank 5mans while leveling, and if you don't invite any other warriors or paladins, you can get all the plate / 2handers to yourself.
---
When the BG ranking system is released, can a hybrid class pick up decent gear across all three specs? 
---
From my experience they are pretty much utility machines. Occasionally you'll find a good one that can compete with the best on the charts, but that requires decent gear, and even then on some fights you won't even get the chance to DPS because your Tranq shot will literally be the most important thing in the raid. You may be told to not do shit by the RL except focus on your Tranq shot rotation - Chromaggus is a good example of this.
---
I played on VeCo and it wasn't that bad. Our server def had a small horde bias, but was only around for half a year before TBC. I have no exact numbers but there were several prominent pvp and pve guilds for both Horde and Alliance. TBC didn't change that much from the time I played, although my sub ran out during Zul Aman. When I returned for Wrath it was much much worse, realm transfers killed the Ally population and Wintergrasp was basically Horde players vs Alliance player bosses (WG gave huge buffs to the disadvantaged faction). 
---
I liked Ve Co, not much RP though, which was fine for me. Lot of entertaining gold hackers and their shows in Org and SW. 
---
Correct me if I'm mistaken but my understanding was that, up until around lv40, priests were horrible levers. Just using a holy fire and then wanding mobs down, zero movement speed increasing effects, very poor, etc.
---
Throughout most of vanilla, Rogues WERE unstoppable killing machines in world PvP. They didn't get their talent revamp until near the end of Vanilla.
---
True but If there were 4 times as many in tbc or wraith we could say it's objectively better than now.
---
You're also free to roll on a PvP server if you don't like PvP, but I reserve the right to think that's a stupid decision.
---
I'm interested in PVE raiding progression, but won't have much time for anything outside of that. 
---
Which class(es) will progress through all end game content with the least time played?
---
MC druid gear is ugly AF
---
~ Sinc, a Paladin that stole all yo gear
---
People will play one long four hour battle and then realize that ten minute games are the only way they will finish grinding their rep before the end of the year.
---
During retail vanilla I used 5 pieces of tier 1 all the way to killing Thaddius because of the set bonus.
---
Though that was partly because I loved elemental and spent most of my dkp on snagging any +spellpower piece I could get. Thankfully back in those days a lot of mages/locks were more focused on their own set pieces over obviously superior non set items.
---
If the 5 piece for shaman is mathematically the best option I got no idea.
---
Hey now, we also get to throw out curses ever few minutes and occasionally get a Banish assignment!
---
Are you sure about that?

Hello folks,
---
I am looking for a guild in **EU** lets say casual raiding or **semi-hardcore** for now. Quit after TBC and never played any Alliance character before but this time don't mind rolling a dwarf tank **or any tank/faction**. I am open to **any looting system** as long as you don't find for an item. Located in London and ready to tank after 20:00 GMT. Cheers
---
It's always great seeing more and more vanilla veterans coming back, it's like being part of a massive school reunion! :D
---
First characcter was dwarf pally.  As i got to Duskwood and began questing a little later these guys on giant lizards were riding around killing everyone in around the town.  I thought it was a GM event lol.
---
&gt; lv 30
---
&gt; Whirlwind axe
---
You are either rich, have high level friends, or slammed your face  against red elementals for an entire day farming for crests.
---
Oh that's cool. With sharding being put into classic I do wonder how and the overcrowding will be, but it's definitely something I'm thinking about given there's no tag sharing in vanilla.
---
It's time to come home brother. Summer 2019!
---
Thinking that people can just roll on all gear and trade it to your friend without being called a ninja makes me think that you are not a real vanilla lover or player. 
---
Why are you suggesting as if I am explaining?  Have a nice day.
---
&gt;In my personal opinion.. people who downplay these things as a non-issue are not real Vanilla WoW lovers, 
---
Always nice to see people open to discussion here.
---
You can love Vanilla and want changes, and you can love Vanilla and not want them.
---
I think rolling on an RP server is not a requirement to RP, but you will be surrounded with players who want a deeper game experience and not simply a vehicle for purple pixels.
---
Yeah, for sure.  The genre was built on the backs of role players.  I don't think anyone should be worried about the servers not existing.  I'm crossing my fingers there in my timezone.  :(
---
i'll probably be going rp-pvp, but theres just one thing i cant understand at all and thats rp-pve servers.
---
I mean rp on the one hand is all about immersion, but pve on the other hand means not being not able to attack your enemies, which is like the opposite to immersion. a paradox imo.
---
Check avg_row_length:
---
51 for bigint
---
37 for int
---
33 for ?
---
Doesn't seem to be the same numbers in there. If that value were the full length, it would be 64 vs 32, so it can't be that. But if it were the reduced value with the leading zeroes cut off, they'd be identical for identical data. Which it clearly is not. Hence, your tables have different data? Also different number of rows.
---
Time passes, and I still can not decide between Hunter and Warlock. Warlock was my first character in vanilla and this could tip the balance toward him.
---
Action slot 4 empty because why not
---
Deadmines was always called VC on my server back in the day 
---
Robert California grows on your after a couple rewatches. I'd give those episodes another chance if it's been a while. It's a different vibe than the earlier seasons, but I really enjoy it now.
---
But I *want* negative people. Without a good amount of negative people you can't have well flourishing guild rivalries. 
---
You need excessive ganking, taking the enemy MT hostage, wiping the other guild's world buffs 2 weeks in a row on raid night to get a good amout of hatred and bad blood going. Maybe infiltrating a same faction rival's guild and ninja some item on Majordomo chest.
---
If you only have well adjusted, mature guilds, there will be no shit flinging, backstabbing and other fun, however douchy behavior. I honestly doubt that on a RP-PvP server there would've been a PvP raid on a girl's real life funeral's tribute in Winterspring: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGHQT3bgLCc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGHQT3bgLCc)
---
I for the life of me cannot decide on which race/class. Any youtubers I should check out to help me with the decision making?
---
people like this are the reason why automated right click reporting should never be in classic.
---
I just never liked the theme of a warrior. I would rather be a bear! But oh well!
---
You invested in property and bought relationships, surely?
---
They think that because private servers can do it then it shouldn't be an issue for blizzard. Without considering that the modern game is so much more complex. 
---
Like you said, time dialation in eve is a fix that works, I remember big battles before that, or Jita at peak times, and CCP only had a large number of players to deal with and no combat effect there. 
---
Most likely they'll use the modern, optimized netcode and make it suitable for Classic's needs, don't you think so?
---
Looks better than the BWL tier set for druid, at least.
---
Born in 02.
---
Ive played alot on private servers, so classic wont be my first vanilla experience. Which im fine with, I've some great memories from playing on pservers, and i just really fucking love playing vanilla. 
---
I do still wish i got to experience vanilla back in the day. For example, I talked with my step brother about vanilla/classic, he had played during vanilla, and i had played on private servers. We talked a bit about dungeons, and i brought up Zul'farrak. He talked about how crazy it was that you needed some item from the other side of the world to be able to fight one of the bosses, and because i had access to all this knowledge from databases and other people just knowing so much more now, i knew that you needed the mallet of Zul'farrak, which you had to create from the Sacred Mallet, which in turn was dropped by an elite troll in the Hinterlands, to summon Gahz'rilla. 
---
It would've been cool to be a noob and get trolled in Barrens chat. But yeah, im still gonna have a blast with Vanilla.
---
Warrior, because Dreadnaught. End of discussion.
---
This,
---
Maybe just briefly after release there will be a benefit in going to Darkshore since NE pop is usually significantly lower than Human pop, but overall I think Westfall is a better choice.
---
The reason is that you're simply plain wrong.
---
The servers used to perform just fine in 100-man battles during for instance Ashran during WoD. During MoP and WoD's era of ability design, you could basically sneeze and it would affect everyone in a 100 yard radius with damage and debuffs. This has been toned down, along with ability purges. So the excuse you are attempting to push simply does not hold up.
---
Well AV is technically 40v40 but the objectives are so spread out that you practically never see a 40v40 clash in the midfield.
---
There's a big difference between having 80 players in the same instance which the servers are very capable of handling, and running a complex combat scenario with 80 players because when 80 players are all launching spells at 79 other players the computational complexity goes up by an order of magnitude compared to smaller, isolated events spread out across an entire map. They can't rely on tricks like load distribution when everything is concentrated in one spot.

If done properly (spec/playstyle) they are very efficient levelers. Wanding is insanely op at lower levels (up to 41 or w/e you need to respec and get shadowform) then they get stronger. You virtually have zero downtime if you can manage last hitting mobs for the spirit gain.
---
Basically at 10 you start with spirit tap talent, then alternate points to wand spec, until you fill them. Really strong, just make sure you get last hits if you level with a buddy.

For your next assignment I would like a PvE ranking and PvP ranking from top to bottom
---
If one hasn’t played rogue in pvp, he only knows rogue one hits them. Fownsides come from actually trying.
---
Presumably Blizzard has actual numbers to back up their claims that it was unpopular. If a silent majority loved old AV, then it wouldn't be unpopular because of the PvPvE
---
yep, and then as you get better you can transition into a bm/marks, but for low gear/leveling it doesn't get any better than bm
---
Well Blizzard's engineers are some of the most talented and experienced people in their field. If some random NEET such as yours truly is smart enough to realize, you can bet your money on the fact that the people who do this for a living are already hard at work solving the problem.
---
Granted. Every Item thats over lvl 55 now looks berzerk. Too bad you can't view characters anymore, so now you have to decide on how they look if they are good enough for your raid. So your heal ends up beeing dressed in blue and your tank in green and you keep wiping to trash mobs forever without understanding.
---
I've narrowed it down to Hunter and Warlock
---
Solo pvp - Pretty much unbeatable, extremely strong. The only classes that can counter them well if both players are good are hunters, paladins and mages.
---
Group pvp - Bad, they can be good to sneak around, infiltrate and slow down a lonely guy that just respawned for example. But it's much more useful to have another class that goes well with the group comp instead.
---
But you will always have fun as a rogue, which is why my first alt will be rogue.
---
Agreed, I've always wondered the same. I love rp, but if I had the choice between PvP and Rp-PvE as it was on the launch of Vanilla, I'd go PvP. 
---
Wing Clip
---
While your comments are valid, the tone makes me not to upvote..
---
Naw its the design of AV. The objective is to win in BG, and players have found the best method to do that. Fighting in the middle or defending a choke point for hours can be fun once in a while, but it is objectively wrong to winning the BG, which is the ultimate goal. It is a PvE oriented BG, if you want more pvp ypu have arathi, wsg, wpvp. It is smart to push to take down towers , kill generala, takw graveyards. You get more honor, which is the primary reason people are in AV more so than the rep.
---
2H fury until you can get Mortal Strike
---
&gt; Before they upgraded the netcode they just didn't have any way to track the players' movement to that degree of precision.
---
Yeah, I remember back in Cata, if you jumped across a flat surface, the server would not update your position until you landed again. This caused dying to fire that my corpse was clearly outside of, on a few occasions before I figured out what was going on.
---
I want them to change the screenshot file format from .tga to .png
---
Well, how often do all 80 players run at each other and just duke it out in the mid field of AV?
---
Blizzard uses a lot of little tricks to get the players to spread out and focus on different objectives.
---
Computationally there is a very big difference between having 80 players in an instance vs. having 80 players spamming everything they have at 79 other players. The computational complexity of something like that is much higher.
---
What I'm saying is, 80 player skirmishes are not normal behavior in PvP. Blizzard tries to funnel and direct players into smaller skirmishes. So you almost never see a true 40v40.
---
I played a rogue in Vanilla. If I recall correctly the speed while in stealth is dramatically slower than retail now. You're either burning all your CDs at once or waiting for them to pop again. You can solo some quests others cannot (or do them quicker) by using stealth to avoid mobs; very handy in caves and tunnels. PvP is fun, have to pick your fights and time your stuns. I'd roll rogue for the WPvP but I wouldn't if I wanted to spend serious time in BGs.
---
The offspring sounds like a boss fight in Gnomergon
---
Yeah, I'm playing druid because of this.  I can tank 5 man's and a couple raid bosses and heal the rest of the time  but won't be expected to no life 
---
I dunno, I rarely saw 80 players battling in the same area in ashran. 
---
I'm not that familiar with EVE however it seems like the game has to deal with less actions going on and its at a lower tick by default than wow.
---
I'm playing a rogue and I can confirm that they're the worst class in the entire game. Spending one minute playing a rogue is perhaps the biggest waste of time in the world.
---
the two are not really comparable, shamans usually are not the healers in bg's but dps with the option to also heal.
---
There’s always downtime while standing around in a main city. 
---
There is literally no class or spec in the game that is "not good" when it comes to PvP.
---
if only it was so easy, I cannot for the life of me pick a main to stick with, I wish I didn't know so much about the game, or that I wasn't such a min maxer, I just want too many things and know I can't get them on one character 
---
Relatively often, if a team back-caps and turns it into a "turtle match." They also have War Games in there for a reason, supporting this type of gameplay. Plus there was Ashran not so long ago (and is coming back as an Epic BG) which was just a zerg battle 40v40. Then there is the Hillsbrad Battleground Brawl event they host. 
---
I understand the responsiveness v performance issue they are trying to balance, but it's clear they skewed it in a direction that is hindering some of their official gameplay formats. 
---
For someone who has never played these classes, this list is freakishly accurate. 
---
If we're doing real talk, then yes, Warriors generally do more damage than Rogues. They're better than them in PvE but it's debatable on PvP. If you can get used to the openers etc. doing PvP with a Rogue will be fun but don't expect it to be as easy as people show it to be on videos. 
---
As for raiding, Rogues are capable of doing good damage but that's really all about it. The level of utility that they bring to the table isn't nearly as comparable to other classes so get ready to face a lot of competition in getting a spot.
---
Zul'jin US alliance called it VC in 2004 
---
Yeah that’s a good point. Even if you’re RPing some sort of hippie pacifist, you can’t protest war that isn’t happening. 
---
Just simply join a guild and hop on their discord to talk with people. Forging new relationships is just as great as always. Practically every guild will have people on discord to hangout with as thats how it was back in the day on ventrillo and such. But now its even more widespread than before from experiencing private servers. Every guild that had a decent amount of guildies in it always had multiple people in discord. Sure maybe your old friends have moved on, so have mine (none of my high school friends play wow). But over the years on playing private servers i now have a group of friends that all play video games with each other and this includes games outside of wow.
---
So TLDR: Join a guild with an active discord, forge new relationships, now you have new friends that share your video gaming hobby.
---
I'm also young and looking to play Classic for the first time. I'm kind of going in blind and hoping for the best. I started in MoP and have been very on and off with WoW. Only thing I'm kind of anxious about is tanking, I don't know any of the old mechanics or anything but I really want to tank. I also watched a video that states tanks are expensive due to all the pots and fire resist stuff you have to farm so it seems like a lot of work, kind of tempted to just go mage instead. The fact that thinking about what I'm going to play in Classic has me more excited than what ever new patch is coming for BFA is crazy lol
---
&gt;braindead
---
lol
---
Okay, allow me to rephrase. How often on modern WoW do you see a true 40 vs. 40 skirmish in Alterac Valley?
---
If I were to guess, not that often.
---
What are your frontrunners?
---
Again, I think you are maybe underestimating that number. Back-capping is a common tactic which can lead to one side ressing at a GY back in their own base, resulting in defensive matches. 
---
I’m still on Suramar with my Vanilla character, Ashram. Alliance NE Druid. I doubt we ever played together, but hey maybe we battled in PvP back in the day!
---
&gt;Presumably
---
I don't give them that much credit. They just reacted to the feedback that they received. When you have a silent majority who doesn't constantly say "gee, this is great how it is" then they are liable to change it to be more edgy &amp; not stale.
---
I think Warrior is for you. Vanilla Mage needs to sit down and drink after every single kill and you don’t seem like the guy for that. I think you like to play with friends who heal you and support you. 
---
Also. Mage consumables are way more expensive. 
---
Honestly between Priest and Mage, but then I also want to play a Warrior...Once I really start thinking about it though, so many classes pop into my head.
---
Wait I think you’re confusing negative people for those out with blood thirst vengeance? That’s not what I meant at all. I meant negative people such as ninja looters, people who deliberately join and quit guilds, just act self righteous. 
---
I didn’t not mean people who camp? Tank, or do world pvp under unfair circumstances. Honestly I think we are all guilty of that at one point or another. There’s nothing like banking someone who’s leveling while running through an area on your main. It’s like a right of passage. You did it to get to where you are, got ganked and ran back to your corpse; it’s tradition to spread it on down to the new characters. 
---
As for serenity now on illidan... I can’t blame them. If something like that we’re to happen I’d be there, probably more so because it’s a server event, but if it ends up as a big brawl so be it. 
---
I'm not sure you know what "objectively" means. Is Fortnite objectively better than WoW because it has more players? 
---
The first several months of WoD, Ashran was mandatory for progression in both PvP and PvE (much to players' dismay). It was notoriously difficult to get into during that time as it was almost always full.
---
You're sort of correct that EVE has less going on per player (though it's a bit more complicated than it sounds), but this is offset by having a _lot_ more players in any one area.
---
Hunter says hi.
---
There's the Supply Bag from Argent Dawn tokens.
---
thats not really true, however they are much easier though and very noob friendly. this also means skilled players cant really shine on them, since they dont have much options. a skilled ele shaman however can from my experience outshine the 10sec bubblehealing, he just has to use his entire toolkit correctly to do so, which is a much tougher task.
---
Couldn't emphasize that enough OP. There are no mandatory things you need to learn from others, even if you intend to go deep in PvE. Just enjoy your adventure.
---
Yeah rogue is incredibly powerful. To top it off, its one of the classes that can raid and PvP effectively without changing specs. That saves you 100g in respec costs that a priest is playing to achieve the same result. 
---
I’m confused why people put the blame on BFA when Legion had this exact same issue and Classic will run on the Legion client. 
---
Soul link lock
---
Put dots up nd go take a shit
---
I don't think the RP will be as strong in 2019 vs 2005. (Who knows though, maybe there's a pent-up demand for vanilla RP than I'm just not giving credit for.)
---
That's the thing - you should seek out the life that *you* want for yourself. To your friend, the life that he wants to live means doing those things.
---
As long as you aren't harming anybody it's fine to live your life the way that you want. Arguably it's way healthier in terms of internal happiness than adhering to societal norms for the sake of 'fitting in'.
---
Which "definition" are you referring to exactly. 
---
this shows how little people understand druid healing in vanilla.
---
ht4 spam is basically just for gearing/early dungeons, or when you're oom in later content.
---
in later content you'll spend the entire fight spamming rejuv.
---
I'm definetely going Rp-PvP. Rping are my fondest memories I have of WoW. The problem with rp is  that it seems that most people don't have the knowledge of the lore nor the patience to come up with a good backstory/personality for their character. If you can get past that, rp is one of the coolest activities in WoW. 
---
But when I play a ROLE playing game I actually really want to identify with my character and immerse myself in the world.
---
I think rp has quite some potential in Classic WoW, because most players actually know what rp is and people who just can't stand rp or the stronger rules of rp server will stay clear of them. If they limit Rp and Rp-PvP servers to one or two per region there is a good chance that quite a large rp community might form.
---
My best rp experience was probably our siege of Northwatch. I was playing a Troll hunter and both the Alliance and Horde role played a battle at Nortwatch. The Alliance players entrenched themselves in Northwatch and the Horde players camped outside. There we would create camp fires and wait for the storm to come. Finally we stormed Northwatch and killed the Alliance holding up in Northwatch. We did it at night and the atmosphere was amazing. 
---
I had a NE Hunter. cant remember the name, but I was in the guild 3Inches of blood
---
I know what you mean. At first I thought he was a creep but then you start to appreciate what a characterture he really is.
---
If you are trying to time the cast to the end of the stealth timer, you may have range issues because rogues and ferals generally aren't standing next to you while they wait for the timer to reset.
---
Oh shit. Time to go into witness protection.
---
Rogues are great but overpopulated for what they bring to a group

AV has - and has had - at least 35vs35 battles almost every game, when one of the teams pushes and the other players are all stacked in one place defending. It's nothing new, and back in WotLK, Cata, WoD, there were far larger scale battles going on in respectively Wintergrasp, Tol Barad and Ash'ran with less lag, so your point doesn't make sense to me. 40vs40 battles in 2019 shouldn't cause the slightest technical issue for Blizzard.
---
Honestly, this love for AV can be chalked up to pure nostalgia as far as I'm concerned.
---
When AV released, everyone hated it. When it was changed, everyone still hated it. I played vanilla wow for over a hundred days played and never met a single person who enjoyed going into AV. The pvp community especially hated it. On private servers... yep, everyone hates it.
---
And now over a decade later people will have you believe they participated in these epic battles that were so much fun. They weren't. You'd join and half the people would be farming, leveling, or straight up afk. Someone would waste their time trying to gather up people, then fail when not even half the bg would listen. The npcs were too strong, but you couldn't just rush past with 15-20 people as 1 single mage could cause the entire group to wipe.
---
So you'd spend a couple hours in this toxic environment where everyone yells and screams at each other, and neither side gets anywhere. Anyone who remembers that shit being fun either was too young to really remember or participate or is just balls deep in rose colored glasses. The fact that someone in your link calls it "the best designed bg" is a joke. I bet that guy spent 10 minutes in AV, hated it, then changed his tune after reading nostalgia posts on the forums.
---
Hunters can't use Mail pre-40 and Plate post-40 so Warriors have at least the armour on lockdown. It's more a problem for the Alliance who have those leveling Retri paladins who want your gear
---
Death Ray is great regardless of class, but it's more of a style move than something you would always integrate into a Mage burst combo that's for sure.
---
Call me pessimistic but I think that they will probably release it on their anniversary date this year (nov 23).
---
I’ve been refreshing “new” on here specifically for that reason haha! I’m expecting the next batch of information to give us the confirmed release date and the start of a beta shortly after :)
---
&gt;There’s nothing like banking someone who’s leveling while running through an area on your main.

Eeegh.

Tried that once. Felt disgusted with myself for a week. Made amends by selling cross faction pets at no profit for the rest of the expansion. 
---
I'll certainly be playing on a PvE server \^\^'

Linken’s boomerang was always a cool trink I liked. Not really worth the time to get it but still cool.

Good lord, the guy in that comment you linked calls it one of the best designed bgs that was ruined, then says he started in cataclism. People actually bandwagoners so much on the old AV myth that people who never played it are on board, lmao.
---
how do you explain the "classic summer" in the last blue post then?
---
Utterly broken in early patches. So-so in 1.12, due to gear inflation, nerfs, and buffs to other classes.
---
The funny thing about retail, is that even though it sucks balls, its still the best MMO on the market right now.
---
Well when Cata expansion came out they altered the whole world basically. Leveling zones changed quite drastically. From changing the level difficulty to how the zone was accessible or what quests were still avaliable.
---
&gt; hunters, paladins and mages
---
As well as any class that can be an orc.
---
Here you find the 25/26/0 holy reckoning specc.

i'm gonna freak out if they mean August when they say summer 
---
probs got something to do with cutting costs, blizz skimping on the servers to save money
---
In premade PvP Rogues are a little bit restricted in so far as you have to play the objective.
---
In WSG Rogues are usually used for flag defense. In a scenario where both teams have the flag Rogues are usually sent on offense to peel healers off of the FC. The goal being to force the FC to leave his safe spot and run into an ambush that your team set up somewhere else. There's a lot of mind games in premade vs. premade WSG.
---
In AB Rogues are usually point defenders or ninja cappers.
---
There's quite a bit of hurry up and wait when playing Rogue in organized PvP.

Someone who knows the lore better than I might be able to expound properly on this, but as I understood it the Alliance basically provoked the Horde into war out of fear mainly, when the Horde was basically just looking to move on after breaking away from the demonic influences as a result of Gul'dan.
---
Almost there, brother! We're in the home stretch now  ;)

[Gift of Arthas](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=11466) is a decent buff, especially for melee heavy groups. I would use them often in Scholo for the SR but they really shine in raids. With 16 debuff slots and the insane amount of Melee Raid DPS fully buffed and the debuff gets even better. Giving all those Rogues/Fury/Tanks another 8 on their topend is pretty big on that scale. Best thing is no one farms Tears of Arthas so it takes like 20 minutes to farm up a stack.

---
If you don't like the look of the undead mage then don't play an undead mage. What about Troll Mage? You can make him have blue skin and blue hair and go Frost.
---
how would that work? would your character get rolled over from the beta to live or would you need to start over?
---
Man he was an awful player haha. Just goes to show how much even random player skill has evolved. Backpedaling, keyboard turning son of a gun. Haha always enjoyed this video. 
---
No but they got jumper cables!
---
Two things:
---
1. In the Cataclysm expansion they changed a lot of the old world. Levels 1-60 still exist and you play through a lot of the same zones but they're different.
---
2. New expansions brought significant game play changes. For example, leveling has been simplified to a point where it's like an extended tutorial and the "real" game starts at max level (or at best it starts in the last 10 or however many levels they added in the most recent expac). So if you wanted to go back and play it just wouldn't be the same experience because levels 1-60 just aren't an important part of the game anymore.
---
Its possible they were too optimistic in their initial prediction. I'd love for it to be released tomorrow, but I have a feeling they will take longer than they initially anticipated to release it.
---
Do you want to tryhard and progress to Naxxramas? If not, then do whatever you want and make it work friend. 
---
It's quite viable as a trash/off tank up to about AQ imo, but druids aren't exactly popular. And ferals having very limited loot in PvE are even less popular. 
---
It might seem a bit niche, but keep in mind that there are people who play stuff like Nightfall hunters spamming wing clip all day. Point is, you can make most things viable if you work for it. 
---
Granted. Your feral form is naked mole rat
---
The world is not the same, Cataclysm completely redesigned Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, all quests, all zones totally different.
---
Not only that but they reworked the classes so much they are no longer recognizable, playing retail WoW today is playing another game, it's no longer the WoW you remember.
---
ya i dont think so. they said summer at blizzcon. they said summer again a few days ago. if they dont think they could meet that they wouldn't have said it at all.
---
&gt; lots of people like current WoW...as a single player RPG
---
Youre defining current WoW players as people that dont like MMOs. The second M stands for "multiplayer", which is definitely not "singleplayer".
---
Our opinions arent entitled, because those people literally changed what WoW is. If they dont like MMOs they shouldnt play them, and they shouldnt demand they be made into single player games. THOSE people are entitled.

You had to find the quest at level 40+ in the hills above Moonbrook. The text was a bunch of gibberish with vague hints about where the objective could be *anywhere* in the world. And of course  back then quest objectives didn't glitter, or if they did it was not much.

The trinket was fun to run around with in large PvP scenarios.

Play alterac valley and sneak bases or play world pvp and grief clothies

I honestly enjoy his wPvP in the beginning. It also has its own PvP video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQp8GESlvfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQp8GESlvfU)
---
Was another thread on this matter really needed?
---
I think they should start with as few changes as possible then after some time introduce some things that are in the spirit of classic. I.e. adding subclasses to races like NE warriors being able to get exclusive DH skills or Troll hunters being able to get some "shadow hunter skills". Even if they just replace existing skills with alternate skills that are mechanically the same but have different animations (or something I'm just going off the top of my head here!) Also expanding zones that were hinted at in quests like grim batal or uldum. They could do some really neat stuff in the spirit of classic. 
---
Also, expand crafting with more recipes and unique or quirky items (dont himoginize the crafting FFS actually think about new and interesting items or effects for each skill).
---
Yeah, unless they were in some crazy elitist guild, there is no way they played on a p server. I made a ton of friends while leveling

---
My plan was to either,
---
a) be a DPS Warrior in raids/5mans, acquire a good portion of my pvp gear through that, and respec if required. Or;
---
b) be an off-tank in raids, flag carry in BGs, slowly acquire off-spec pvp gear for DPS, and when I have enough gear/gold change specs for pvp.
---
I am leaning more towards Tauren warrior after reading these comments, but if I was to go mage i would really consider a troll.
---
 i dont see anything really impressive except the amount of time he spent grinding the gear. Constant heals and dispels on a warrior with gear is expected to perform like this 
---
A good example of how a Warrior with good gears and support can become an unstopable murdertrain.
---
Due to a talent in survival that increases your ap by a % of your agility (atleast I think that's how I remember it working) survival would out dps marksman. 400 or so seems to sound right from memory but I would have to Google it to be for sure. But yes survival does indeed out dps marksman if you're above that threshold
---
Get over yourself.
---
I was the co-GM of one of the longest-running RP guilds on Maelstrom-US. I also ran the community RP forums, and frequently organized in-game events for RP'ers. I also helped organize a few RP/PvP events.
---
I was a roleplayer. I spent a lot of time RP'ing in game. I also spent a lot of time doing the same out of game, via forums or writing stories, or whatever else.
---
My "main" on live -- even though I'm not currently playing -- is on an RP server.
---
We had people in our guild that didn't roleplay. There were plenty of people that flocked to the RP/PvP server type simply because their friends played there, or because they didn't RP themselves, but enjoyed the more active cities and whatnot that those types of servers tend to have.
---
World of Warcraft is a dynamic game with a lot of things to do. Not everyone is going to be IC 24/7. Most people won't. Most people will want to dabble in a bunch of things -- not just one. *That's fine.*
---
People like you -- that relentlessly try to chase out everyone that doesn't fit your litmus test for who belongs on an RP server -- often add nothing to the community. There were a ton of people *just like you* on Maelstrom that grumbled about their not being enough RP on the server. They all left and went off to Moon Guard when it opened, only to leave that server to go to Wyrmrest Accord.
---
Building a healthy RP community means taking in people who don't necessarily want to RP. A lot of those people will end up RP'ing anyway, as it's likely not something they've been exposed to. Or they won't. Whatever. But there's no reason to prevent new blood from coming in.
---
I just came across a video that lays out some details they had originally planned for additional content in vanilla:

The current iteration of WoW has evolved into a totally different game at its core.
---
People are not interested in the new flash ARPG style of game that Retail WoW provides, and are hence very excited to play a version of the game people enjoy.
---
Think of it as WoW Classic being a very simple WWII Shooter, and WoW:BfA is Apex Legends
---
While they are both Shooters, they are radically different in gameplay and design.
---
Don't forget to put abolish poison as you escape to avoid blind.
---
I haven't played WoW fully since grinding to 70. Started right around release year. I won't be playing classic without the rp PvP realm option.
---
&gt; You can honestly see that 90% of changes blizzard made to the game were without real understanding of what made the game work, and so the current WoW isn't a game where you are engaged as much as you are consuming mindlessly. This is especially true where BFA is optimised on "slot machine" gameplay which can only be described as vacuous and brain-dead.
---
well said 
---
Okay reading through this post and all the comments have just cemented the idea that Blizz did a pretty good job of giving each class its pros and cons and one or two compelling reasons to play that class. So, we should all just play the class we enjoy the most and that suits our playstyle depending on what we plan to do the most in the game.
---
Although, one thing I did get out of this was realizing how the Paladin class affected gear rolls for other classes on Alliance side during Vanilla (I was Horde back then).
---
"you're stupid" and "in my opinion you're stupid" are the same thing. Both are an attack on the other person's intelligence because they disagree with you over a video game
---
\&gt;  If you’re enjoying yourself **while taking care of your responsibilities**, nobody should judge you for that including yourself.
---
Your comments raises two important points:
---
* As long as you meet your obligations, and continue to develop yourself, sinking a few hours per week into a video game should be of the least concern, to you and to anyone else.
---
I played World of Warcraft from the age of 14 to 19, and continued my love of video games well into adulthood. To this day, I regularly set aside a few hours per week to indulge my latest fix, whether it's Resident Evil 2 or Insurgency: Sandstorm.
---
But I'm also a 29-year-old with two Master's degrees, a half dozen certifications, and a full-time job. My rent is paid, my social obligations are met, and my gym routine is observed. As an adult, World of Warcraft could never threaten any of that.
---
Having said that...
---
* Some people \*do not\* meet their obligations nor do they develop themselves. And video games can contribute to their problems. 
---
I hate to say it: But some people are not in a good space. Not necessarily due to their own choices, of course. But the addition of World of Warcraft to their litany of distractions and sources of procrastination probably won't help them. 
---
I know a lot of former guildmates and friends who "failed to launch," so to speak. They focussed so much on WoW, that they neglected the rest of their lives. And this pattern of personal neglect went on for years and years, in some cases. 
---
If those people are feeling hesitant about starting up again when Classic launches... those feelings shouldn't be ignored. 
---
Several guides I've read have mentioned 500 as the threshold. Though I've never been close to that geared myself. I find the spec appealing as a PVE/PVP hybrid spec since Agi influences dodge, crit etc as opposed to just the weapon damage in MM. Hoping to some day get enough Agi to make it pay off :)
---
If you want to see anything past Molten Core, do NOT listen to the people telling you that you can heal with 20 points in holy. The bare minimum is 30, as crit chance and Divine Favor is absolutely necessary as a raid healer. To raid as paladin in any decent guild, your stat priority is +Healing, Spell crit, MP5, Intellect. This means that you WILL be wearing cloth and leather for your raid set.
---
You will be slightly tankier than a priest with no range abilities. You will have less fun than a warrior when you are fighting 2-3 mobs.  You can accumulate pieces of your tier set for solo play that will help a bit, but you will have to keep note of how much weaker your heals will become and the decrease in mana efficiency.
---
When you are leveling, you can use some of the mentioned specs for some autonomy, but genuinely once you start seriously raid healing you lose the ability for solo play or spend ridiculous amounts of gold respeccing between raids. Paladins that commit to raid healing are the least fun and most infuriating classic class to solo on. By a wide margin.
---
It's because the sort of people that are drawn to RP aren't the sort of people that tend to be good at WoW. I realize that's kind of blunt, but as someone who spent *years* on an RP and RP/PvP server, it's just the truth. It's not why they play the game. Immersion, in the sense of completely controlling your character's story, is more important to them that immersion in the sense of being part of a living world.
---
So your pet can have a pet?
---
I think you need to reread the post friend
---
**Concerning PvP**, you keep hearing that they aren't that good because that's actually true most of the time. Rogues are extremely reliant on long CDs (5 min Vanish, 5 min Sprint, 5 min Evasion), and are probably the least durable class in the game, being very vulnerable to melee Damage / DoTs. 
---
A rogue without sprint CD who gets engaged from the distance even by an ungeared guy is dead. A Warlock puts 3 DoTs on a rogue ? He can sacrifice VW and go AFK, the rogue is dead. A warrior engaged a rogue without Evasion CD in a BG ? If the rogue doesn't use an other CD or makes things last longer with Suriner, he'll be dead in 5 sec. Oh, that BM hunter sent his enraged pet against a rogue whose CDs aren' up ? His pet doesn't even need help, the rogue is dead. Etc.
---
Rogues are the least demanded class for PvP premades. It's not that they're inherently bad at it, it's just that they don't offer any use at group PvP other classes give, especially if your group plays against an other organized premade. They can get three shotted by pretty much any other DPS class, and if they get a Faerie Fire debuff or get to an area full of AoE, their core class mechanic, Stealth, is broken, and they're redenred useless, actually straining your healers for nor reason.
---
I played a lot of rogue PvP in WotLK, when all rogue's CDs were about twice shorter, and I can tell you that when I tried creating myself a 60 rogue on a Vanilla server to test it a little bit some time ago I was just appaled by the PvP gameplay, and didn't stand it 2 hours. You can demolish better geared players once in 5 mins ... and the rest of the time you're a free HK. I don't even know how somebody who experienced rogue gameplay in the golden days of PvP during S6-S7-S8 could even endure playing a Vanilla rogue, it's vastly unsatysfying. Then, if you're super good, playing against unreactive noobs/people with shit gear, and have all your CDs up, it can still give things like that :

---
Don't count on it though. 
---
In PvE they're fantastic, along with being good at Gold Farming, but other answers already covered that, so there's not much to add. 
---
I'm in a very similar situation. I like the idea of tanking, but the responsibility is daunting. Choosing a class for classic has been one of the hardest decisions I've ever made in a video game tbh. Very tempted to roll druid and just do everything.
---
I just came across a video that lays out some details Blizzard had originally planned for additional content in vanilla:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-HFjHKJJ7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-HFjHKJJ7E)
---
Hunter is a false noob friendly class.  Levelling is easy but then at 60, in raid you got one complex rotation to do average dps, you are expected to kite, and in pvp you got a high skill cap with few room for mistake. Let's not forget the pet management in dungeon.
---
In 2004 i was doing 300x300 castle siege in Lineage 2 on pirate server
---
In 2019 official Blizz server can't handle 40x40
---
regress of mmo
---
I feel that. 
---
It’s a cycle; you get ganked while leveling and then tank those leveling when you’re done. Like a right of passage. 
---
Well, we are an EU guild so we have to have raidtimes compatible with all EU timezones, as much as possible.
---
You monster
---
No. Warlocks are bad early on because they lack spell hit, for shadowbolt, on their destruction tree. Warlock spells also generate a crazy amount of threat--more than mage spells.
---
Yes, the 10 man and 4 man completion were not. It was an ongoing competition that a lot of top guilds had fun with. And part of the reason you could sucker a lot of your guildies into doing the fight in a way that takes an hour was more bags. It isn't like they needed the gear at that point and you don't need that many heads every week. 
---
I don't think pvp should even have personal rewards.
---
That actually sounds exactly like what I want. 
---
I'm not sure why it's so hard for some people to just relax and be decent to people while playing a video game. I swear to god they think their edgy jokes, shitty attitude, and trolling make them the Ghandi or MLK of free speech. Like no, we're not trying to censor you but please go be an asshole somewhere else.
---
&gt;not mentioning dual wield enhance shaman 
---
&gt;Does anyone else got this weird feeling? I used to play wow with friends, but now we're grown ups and we don't even talk to each other. Im super hyped about classic but at the same time i feel bad. Like why am i going to play a game that i used to play with friends when i was 12-15 yo. Some of my friends got married and even are parents. I feel like im stuck in time
---
Yes, I do. Having it for over 10 years.
---
That’s just it. It’s not hard to fit in while not actively trying to RP some crazy deep scenario. That’s why I don’t understand the hate from that other guy who was fighting with me about rolling on an RP server. It’s sad really. You can be present and not go out of your way and still enjoy the environment. 
---
There were very few RP-PVP realms at original launch, and I'd imagine there will be again.
---
The game is still at least four months away. Only a tiny fraction of the playerbase is even thinking about guild recruitment right now.
---
I don't think you can remotely draw any conclusions about populations based on guild recruitment threads on the forums when the game is still so far away.
---
I don't get what you mean, do you want flowers and kisses with your knowledge? :p
---
Yes it was a thing, yes it’s something blizzard allows (as long as one button leads to one action per running game instance), yes people frown upon it.
---
Talk about one Hell of a reach.
---
I'm in. Pass me that foil my good sir.
---
If you just look at numbers (who queued for what) that doesnt really give you the whole story. Yea you can say "people dislike AV" but is it /specifically/ because they dont want PvE in their PvP? Or is it a multi-factor problem where they want PvE in their PvP, but other aspects are keeping them from enjoying AV (thus they dont queue)?
---
Was allowed in vanilla, is currently allowed on retail.  
---
I wasn’t saying you could, only saying that there wasn’t even 1 example. Even though there is a need for one. In case blizzard is somehow gushing interest doing research, they would see a lack of interest on this reddit; that was the point of this post. 
---
&gt; Looking at the threads for guild recruitment it seems like there is a lack of RPPvP interest. I leveled my first 60 in vanilla on Lightninghoof, and it was great. I didn’t even really partake in RP, but I feel like the server tag brought in more quality people.  
---
I'll probably activaly RP on non-RP server
---
Paladin. Toss on some damage reflect gear and farm DM:E
---
I read it the first time and reread it. I'm fine with what I posted.
---
Exactly 15 years later, to the day. This is the prophecy!
---
Yep. Blizzard patched the game on a wednesday and shortly after people discovered they had an extra talent. The bug was submitted, there wasn't enough time to fix it before the weekend and Pat filmed the video.
---
This video caused so many people to roll a Warrior thinking Warriors were unstoppable murder machines, which they kind of were with a pocket healer and a free action potion, but not to quite such an extreme. Unless a similar bug is reintroduced we'll never see Warriors perform quite this highly again.
---
Yeah, it's between this sub and mmo-champion all day at work for me lol
---
See that is also what i have heard, but in all the DPS calculation videos on youtube etc. it is always only MM spec, letting me to believe it might just be a myth
---
My understanding is that the context of the comment was in regard to the current and always-changing playerbase of MMORPG's. In other words, the casuals.  Some of us will log in and spend 20 hours per week trying to clear classic Naxxramas, and it will take us months to do so. We know what we want. It's not what Blizzard tells us we want. It's what us hardcore players want. However, we are the minority. WoW had millions of subscribers, but how many of them do you think raided MC, or raided Naxx? Not even close to that many.  A tiny fraction of that many.
---
Those players who didn't raid and couldn't dedicate tens of hours per week to vanilla are Blizzard Activisions cash cow. They didn't want, and probably still don't want that crazy hardcore vanilla grindfest that you and I do. Those players are the reason Blizzard is still afloat. It's not the hardcore vanilla-wanting players that we are on this subreddit. 
---
You think you do, but you don't was aimed at those people. Not at us. I dedicated a huge chunk of my youth to WoW, but 95% of players didn't, and they still don't want to. We just need to be grateful that they're giving us this, being the minority and all.
---
I do believe he could have worded his thinking much differently. Either way, THAT is what he really meant with his comment.
---
No I’d just like “here are some things I would add” better than “things you got wrong/missed”.
---
For me the language chosen leads to arrogance and potential clash of opinions (conflict). In this case it highly contradicts tone of the OP.
---
Easily paladins. They're up there with mages when it comes to AoE farming, as long as you're willing to grind a few items for it. Just pick up conc and redoubt and off you go.
---
Never played pservers. We did this in vanilla well into AQ40 for bags. Literally 100% of the loot that dropped was sharded every run, but bags kept being useful. Also the head, but we didn't need to low man it for the head, we low manned it for bags. Like, EJ and other guilds competed to low man it. EJ did the first 10 man completion, but the fight takes like an hour with ~5-6 people. But part of the reason you could actually convince people to do the fight in an hour with a handful of people instead of in five minutes with 40 is because everyone wanted more bag space. 
---
Not even talking about people cheesing the lockout, which is a different thing altogether that also happened. That WAS for cloaks and gear tho. 
---
It's not as bad as some people make it seem. Any healer can do DM jump runs with a warrior. Priests can holy nova farm lashers in DME. Druids can stealth run dungeons with a rogue for shards or other valuable items like righteous orbs. You can also always take a gathering profession to make some gold. 
---
"*I see now why your high levels cannot stop ganking low levels. Every reprisal is itself an act of aggression, and every act of aggression triggers eventual reprisal.* 
---
*It ends TODAY. Here. The cycle ends when you, high level, and you, low level, turn from one another. And walk. Away.*"
---
Or something. I personally rather just opt out of the whole thing from the onset, because I don't have high opinions of it. 
---
My main has always been a Belf Paladin, but honestly the Vanilla factions just feel...right
---
I think he means it's ridiculous because they can all heal/ tank those dungeons, not because they are 'meme' specs.
---
Just read the blue post, you're actually probably correct. They wouldn't have not only reemphasized Classic Summer, but also posted additional clarification on the soom TM.
---
&gt;I think it has to do with the fact that most people played their first RPG on a PC/console and never really had the pen &amp; paper experience of roleplaying.
---
I think the pen and paper people are the cancer. Instead of normally playing their character, the pretend to be playing some pen-and-paper game in the game.
---
Especially such things, as you, completely in-character, approach a random in-character party, and start talking to them, completely in-character. They absolutely ignore you, as if they didn't see you. You start shouting, yet they seem to remain undisturbed. You stand in the middle between then, and. using emotes, you put out a guitar, and start playing so loud so nobody can hear others' words. They still don't care, and seem to be perfectly comprehending each other. And you get an /w from one of them, "can you stop disrupting RP?" - even without any // or ((, complete lack of in-characterness.
---
Loot trading is the new "Reserved" - except it will just happen &amp; there won't be any way you will ever find out, unless they tell you.
---
Yeah, Blood elfs are pretty awesome. They probably have the best story arc in the whole warcraft lore. But the way they were implemented in WoW was just horrible.
---
It’s fun though!!
---
Ahh yes. It wasn’t just the extra talent though, it’s everything vanilla was then. Dispels with no CD, classes with fewer escapes, the scaling of warriors with gear vs other classes. This video summarizes vanilla so well. It’s kinda crudely made, features a huge bug, has a lot of really bad players in it, and is super imbalanced.
---
I won’t be playing Classic, but god damn if I don’t miss it.
---
Sadly it was and still is a thing.
---
&gt; Mages actually want to aoe grind when servers are too populated to abuse the dynamic respawns not because they are ahead of the pack, if you are on an average server pop without much dynamic respawns I'd stick to normal questing.
---
There's no way there will be dynamic respawns in Classic...
---
Which is conveniently just a few days after the BFA content patch (adding new races). [This fits my tinfoil theory very well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aw4s96/dont_resub_until_classic/ehjva6r/)
---
However, with how seldomly they've talked about classic so far it'd be completely uncharacteristic to release any news so soon after the latest update.
---
You can’t force people do something they don’t want 
---
I’m married and just got my first child a month ago, and i’m super excited for classic wow. Been playing since 2005. I don’t think i have the time to get close to raiding, unfortunately, but i want to so much.
---
Nothing wrong with it bro, feels are feels, just gotta enjoy them &lt;3
---
I was a bear tank tank trough several expansion, but I'm not sure if its worth the effort when you get told at lvl 60 to be a heal bot or pound salt.
---
Yes, any clip from any of perplexity's vids.
---
For personal DPS, yes, For raid DPS, no. You have to factor in the lost damage from not buffing a group with TSA, so it doesn't come out ahead. Guilds that actually got to Naxx were all about playing together as a team in an efficient way. 
---
There were a handful of times once Naxx was on farm that a Hunter in a guild would respec for one run just to see if the math checked out. Then they switched back, because while sure their personal DPS was higher, it wasn't higher enough to justify the loss of TSA to others.
---
So was I! I was in The Black Chaos during Vanilla, and 3 Inches of Blood during TBC. 
---
3.0 inches ≈ 7.6 centimetres ^(1 inch = 2.54cm)
---
Priest, Holy Nova DM:E farming.
---
Damn is right! That’s crazy how many he took on haha
---
It might be a bit annoying running slow for the priest for 20 levels but it would be a strong combo for sure.
---
Shaman and Priest can farm DM E as well. Don't know about druid.
---
Granted. However, your character in particular will be required to wear a bicyclist helmet for aerodynamics. This way things can go over your head in the most efficient way possible.
---
&gt;Warrior:
---
    WAAAAAAGHHHH
---
I can already hear the Lawyers for Games Workshop running to DMCA this post ;)
---
I think /u/ohyuckie makes a valid point. He’s rolling on a role play server to roleplay with other role players. He doesn’t want people who don’t actually want to roleplay to water down the pool of people to actually interact with. 
---
Or worse, people who actively try to make his experience worse by interrupting or griefing roleplay moments.
---
Anyways, I get your point too, OP. That RPPvP realms might have a more mature playerbase and that’s why you’ll make one your home server.  Which may be a good choice for yourself. However I don’t think that’s the sort of thinking that you should advocate others to follow.
---
I mean it sounds somewhat ridiculous when you put it succinctly.
---
“Hey guys, consider making your characters on a **role playing** player vs player realm, and then don’t **role play!**”
---
earth shock is not an interupt you mean windsheer i think
---
Those mages are pretty bad. 
---
Honestly, just acting like a normal and decent person (i.e., how you would act if you weren't behind a computer screen) is probably a pretty accurate RP for an adventurer in Azeroth anyway. Who really walks around telling strangers about their grand origin story?
---
Plan on playing legacy? I will be.
---
The RPers left when there weren't enough people on the RP servers that RP?  How does that not prove my point?
---
Well I get that too, I honk that most people would end up RPing sooner or later, it’s pretty natural. As for griefing, it’s not hard to not do that. 
---
The passive always-on regen from Troll probably doesn't have any competition in terms of downtime honestly. For a similar reason Undead might be 2nd best. Then weapon skills, so Human/Orc, then literally the rest are pretty much on the same tier. Doubt any of those racials will make a difference. 
---
Another "informed"post by someone that never played Vanilla and is using private server data backup his post.
---
The line between vanilla and pservers has blurred for a lot of people.
---
Yeah I agree.
---
However racials for leveling is such a really fucking small thing and they are pretty important at 60. 
---
At the end all of his abilities are on cd. This is always were they make a cut in the video. Because now he would get his ass kicked. 
---
I'd say agree to disagree. Our opinions cannot be reconciled, so it's pretty much the only thing we'll be able to agree on in that regard. 
---
Sounds like I got out at a good time. Get to keep the good memories I had without pandas in them lol. Thanks for the info on the changes. Saw the announcement for the new vanilla launch and was confused, but now get it
---
It's been 24 hours and no one's got it...
---
You get nothing! You lose! Good day sir!
---
I agree but when a guy says "I'll level 3 or 4 Warriors" I get the impression he doesn't care about playing at 60 that much.
---
It's also worth keeping in mind how timezones are going to impact the feel of population.  A 10k server might feel evenly crowded around the clock, whereas a 3k server might feel *just as crowded* during peak times (5pm to 10pm or whatever) but then empty on off-hours.
---
I had a mage named Fountain in vanilla and I miss him dearly.
---
 **&lt;The** **Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me
---
your pet can have a pet which could be a druid in cat/bear form
---
&gt; two Master's degrees
---
Is that 4 years for bachelor and then 2x2 years for each Masters or are you able to cross-over some?
---
You'll meet new people on the game!  That's half the fun!
---
Heirlooms fundamentally changed the way leveling was viewed. It ended up being just a hurdle to overcome. This mentality got further emphasized in later expanions.
---
Cataclysm changed the geography and questing experience significantly. With more focus on hand-holding and a linear progression path through the zones.
---
Classes changed significantly through the lifetime of wow, and the gameplay is now much more of an arcade game-feel, than an RPG feel.
---
Loot and equipment has changed beyond recognition. You no longer look at a person and think to yourself 'Ah, that person has an Ashkandi! That's amazing!' (first of all, you can change the appearance of your gear), but more importantly all the gear you have now gets reduced to a single numeric value that signifies how powerful you are. And this is the value that you get judged by throughout your time playing the game.
---
The group dynamic also no longer revolves around holding aggro. That can be done spamming random abilities. Instead it's about how much damage you can do, and as a tank, whether or not you can press the right mitigation ability at the right time, to not get 1shot by an ability.
---
Towards the end of WotLK, a feature that automatically groups you up with other people from other servers and automatically teleports you to the dungeon got implemented. It is probably the single feature that had the most influence on how people interacted with each other and played the game.
---
Just a quick clarification. The original 1-60 world record is 4d20h and the unofficial (pserver) is 3d7h. In WoD there was a guy that did 1-100 in 2h14m.
---
It's a *really* stout dwarf.
---
Hunters can't wear plate.
---
"hunter stat stick" and "warrior slow 2h" don't overlap very much at all.
---
I wish Will of the forsaken could break polymorph effect.
---
Very out of date information. Warlocks are a top tier PVP class, and definitely not an underplayed class anymore (if you look to servers like ed/nost/etc, they were fairly popular)
---
Classic servers will not have a 2500 cap, and they shouldn't. They need to accommodate all the retail tourists that will try it for a week.
---
If they kept the cap low we'd all be left with dead servers in a month and would need to have merges, which blizzard is absolute shit at. Merging is also temporary sharding but 100x worse.
---
Horde side undead was better because of the extra shadow res in bwl and cannibalize can be used mid combat like bandages.  Alliance side human were better because of rep buff and weapon skills. 
---
I’ve never played a private server AV that wasn’t an Alliance 45 minute sweep. 
---
You can vanish out of entangle and with evasion up bash has a very low chance of hitting. If the druid is being ganked while questing cat form they're pretty much dead. This isn't TBC with quick cheap shifting and mad bear dps/lotp healing.
---
Some notes on Druids:
---
&gt; Feral can offtank certain raids, better off rolling a Warrior if you want to tank though
---
Feral druids are the best dungeon tanks and raid-offtanks in the game period. Their single target threat is uncontested, their DPS is much higher than the one from a prot-warrior both when tanking and pure dpsing. They can decurse/heal ok. They provide a powerful aura. The reason you only want 1-2  of them is because you prot warriors provide other utility such as being able to swing support weapons and being able to jump in as a main-tank, which is the thing Druids can't do with a few exceptions.
---
&gt; Leveling is relatively easy, probably somewhere in the middle in terms of speed/ease 
---
Druids level incredibly fast. They are situationally stronger than Hunters when it comes to difficult quests. They can both tank and heal in dungeons, so will find groups *much* faster than Hunters/Mages. They have very little downtime.
---
Yes please. Gaming is active! 
---
Can't stand Netflixxers who search for the next series like junkies... 
---
Using the in-game rolling system on raid drops is one of the least vanilla things I have ever heard.
---
Maybe it is  private server thing, but pug raiding with no master loot was beyond rare.
---
&gt;**YOU** were the one that brought up feral druids and pummelers. And since Paladins dont even use Pummelers at any point in the game for any spec, you have a to a special kind of idiot to think that somehow the Paladins ability to farm pummelers is relevant to anything here. Complete no brain response from you.
---
If you bothered to look up what I was responding to, you would notice that this entire discussion has been about PvE viability of ret paladins. Paladin's ability to farm pummelers is relevant because the guy I was responding to was arguing that paladins can do competitive DPS if you use a spellpower stacking [pummeler build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg7t4Lwj4cg).
---
The only reason I mentioned feral druids was to show that unlike a feral druid who can at least pull some non-garbage numbers just by powershifting, his paladin build is completely dependant on the pummeler and will have a much harder time farming it since he can't stealth past mobs.
---
&gt;Are you a complete idiot or what?
---
Well, I'm not the guy skimming texts to find a single phrase and respond to it while ignoring what the text is actually saying.
---
Why do people do this? Deleting their char I mean...
---
Granted, but you are now stunned for twice the duration of polymorph.
---
&gt;I wish I didn't go OOM every time I give a Fort buff 
---
Granted, but every other spell costs all of your mana

I was on Arthas when Pat made it big, our server population went from High to (you're 300th in queue) after this video's release. Pat even had to make a forum post on the Server Forums that was something to the effect of, "guys, please stop whispering me when I log on. I'm not PvPing anymore, I essentially log on to grind in Silithus and listen to MP3's (I remember that distinctly, cuz I thought to myself who says "MP3's and not just music lol)" and I kind of felt bad for him, guy couldn't even play the game without getting bothered as soon as he logged on. Granted, DND was a thing but, he was just getting bombarded with whispers as soon as he logged on, must've been hell. 
---
I never played with him personally, but I did play with is guild in WSG a few times, the teams was REALLY good and it's one of those vanilla memories I hold dear, just because, like, who else can say that? 
---
Ah, I miss what Arthas was as a server, and I rolled on it by complete chance after noping out of an RP server after I found out there was no PvP. 
---
I honestly didn't think MoP was that bad. The main thing you will hear people say they like about vanilla than current wow is the philosophy. This philosophy started changing in Wotlk and it never stopped. It's not that current wow is different because it has pandas. It's different because the entire design philosophy was essentially inverted. I think pandas are dumb too but it'd choose them over personal loot and group finder any day.
---
????
---
Getting rewards IS the fun. Why do you think we keep doing the same raid every single week for months on end? For those sweet purple pixels.
---
I played a rogue in Vanilla as it was recommended to me if I wanted to PvP. 
---
To be honest, they kind of suck in group PvP. Unless you get the jump on someone and have all your cooldowns available, you're at the disadvantage. So as soon as you pop out of stealth, warriors and hunters are going to switch to you instantly and nuke you down.
---
Hunters tagging you with hunter's mark as you ride from the GY to the battle/node is *extremely* annoying. Walking everywhere in stealth is extremely slow.
---
You're very dependent on your cooldowns which are 5 minutes long, so you'll find in BGs you're without them most of the time.
---
Rogues take advantage of opportunities but sometimes there are no opportunities, so you kind of feel useless.
---
In a 1v1 situation with all your cooldowns, you'll destroy people. But many times you'll think it's 1v1 and then a NE or rogue will come out of stealth and nuke you, and you have none of your CDs available for another 5 minutes.
---
It sounds pessimistic and you can disagree if you want, but if you're looking for 1v1 WPvP ganking, rogues are great. If you want BG / group PvP, look for a different class.
---
Yes and unfortunately.
---
I hope it doesn't come earlier than June at least because my May is a mess... but after that im in the clear to start!
---
The Ghostweave set (tailor) &amp; the "Living" armor (Leatherworker) are both decent for the their level when you are starting on the path of making a healing set. As mentioned, the only two things you will be using further into the endgame are Corehound Belt &amp; Hide of the Wild. Since al these things are BoE, you might as well skip tailoring &amp; LW and go for herbalism/alchemy or another gathering profession. You can buy the stuff you need or have a crafter make the item for you.
---
I think Druids will take a large hit to levelling speed compared to expectations. Shred is a very good dps skill. Claw is a garbage. Being forced to use claw is basically a -30% dps debuff for a druid, it will drastically slow their levelling. I mean it only really matters if you're racing to 60, so who really cares I guess - but people expecting private server druid levelling speed will be in for a shock.
---
That's the best thing I read on this sub
---
mmm windfury totem
---
Is the passive regen enough to even be noticeable?  It's a very meager amount of regen in my experience.
---
At one point, until a colonial island slave found the way to make vanilla beans self polinate, it was one of the most expresnive and scarce luxury resource. The bean sprouts could only be grown in one part of the world before that boy found out, by playing with the plants, using knowledge from working in his masters garden. There is a TON of interestimg history behind the vanilla bean
---
Tuning MC will reduce the margin of error for 80% of people playing classic. This is more important when people can roll in there with DM gear and other pre-BiS items that essentially make it farming content from Day 1.
---
Very valid point and exactly what I was thinking when I wrote those six words, you’re very right there. 
---
For some, probably more people than we’d hope, it can be problematic. MMO’s have that tendency to be addictive and shut out other things. 
---
But as long as you take your responsibilities seriously, you really earn the right to spend your free time in whatever way pleases you. I think people who choose to do something they love in those cases, even when others might not approve, are really cool.
---
Work a job, workout regularly, maintain a strict sleeping schedule, do 15 minutes of chores when you get home before you play, have some nights out with friends once or twice a week, take breaks from the game occasionally (just because), go on vacations, if you have a pet spend time with it (I used to take breaks to walk my dog or straight up play with one hand while I pet my cat), listen to music or podcasts when you're leveling solo, play with friends if you're able* (this is HUGE) - and be social in the game aswell. Yea, I'll miss some going out if a huge event is happening - and I'll miss huge events to go out. You don't have to experience everything. This time around it's about the fucking fun of it people, it's all been done before - just embrace the experience of a beautifully made game. 
---
If someone spend 20 hours per week playing tetris alone in the dark I would say what the fuck is wrong with you? But this is a social experience. Don't let it consume you (I've been there m8), but always remember on game friends are the same as real life friends. You're connecting with other humans. 
---
I play priest currently and have the luxury of having tier sets (specifically t2 at patch 1.9 right now) that are close to BiS (or in the case of the legs, BiS). 
---
I'm considering rolling pally when actual classic releases (focusing mainly on PVE content, so focusinf mainly on healing at endgame). I know hybrid classes in general can't necessarily count on tier sets being BiS or close to it -- how does pally T1 T2 and T3 function in vanilla PVE progression? Are they useful pieces, or will I be cobbling together the usual hybrid hodgepodge of BiS?
---
That is the retail attitude &amp; why we have multiple difficulties.
---
I always played on PvE servers. Thinking about shaking things up and doing PvP. I'm not one for deep roleplaying but I think I would enjoy a little bit of it. I might just have to try it out this time around.
---
For the Alliance!
---
bachelor is usually 3 years and master 1,5 - 2 with like you mentioned some cross-over.
---
I have a mate that did his BA+ 2xM in 5,5 years total, but both masters had a ton of "cross-over"
---
&gt;  The humans that betrayed them all got turned into scourge/forsaken
---
So, I never played a human in WoW but what was the lore behind Stormwind not helping in WCIII? Was it because they were still rebuilding? 
---
Because to me the BElfs joining the Horde made sense for 2 reasons. 
---
1. the humans (and alliance as a whole) for the most part abandoned them in their time of need. 
---
2. Sylvanas was of noble blood (IIRC) and, despite being undead (albeit, the leader of the Forsaken) still could in theory have influence among the survivors. 
---
Those 2 things didn't make it as big a stretch as some people make it out to be, at least to me, but honestly this was by far the least of the troubles I had with the direction lore took in TBC, so I didn't pay as much attention to it as some of the other things. 
---
My Bachelor's degree was in Canada and it took three years, as I carried over credits from the International Baccalaureate (IB) system. 
---
My Masters' degrees were done in France, whose university system permits concurrent study ('*Cohabilitation*' or '*accréditation conjointe*'). So not only did both degrees cross-over, but their respective fields were complementary (International Law and Philosophy) and both universities were in the same city. 
---
Thanks for asking, I guess!  
---
A graphics update OPTION doesn't impact the game in any way other than pleasing those who like it. It's fine to have if Blizzard feels it's worth the man hours to perfect.
---
I've tested most of the graphic update options for private servers. At 1st I though it was great, but later realized I didn't like the new animations and character face choices were typically bland and lacked variance.
---
I changed back to original graphics. The original animations and graphics had more soul and emotion. Most will miss this sadly if they immediately use the improved options.
---
The old graphics and animations just have more style and you get used to them faster than you think.
---
Thats kind of the way i remember it but it was long ago regular pvp servers were generally very unbalanced that i remember.
---
Technically they are the master of off tanking if that makes you feel better
---
The effect is broken and you live out the remainder of your days as a sheep
---
FYI: Trolls and Orcs make better tanks . But Tauren is still good!
---
Repair bot for engineers :)
---
You can't vanish with faerie fire on you.
---
Ah, awesome, well done!
---
Lol this Blizzard-Activision hate circle jerk is amazing.  You could say hindsight is 20/20, but they made all the right decisions as a business.  LFG/LFD/LFR was a dream for the casual player base. Being able to casually farm mats without being ganked or not finding a single node in an entire loop felt better. The paid casual subs they gained from these additions FAR exceeds the free sub count to this sub. Businesses don't run on positivity and good vibes. Yes, these additions caused me to stop playing because being the "best" didn't mean as much anymore, but I can't fault them for making billions of additional revenue because of that decision.
---
Stop posting bad faith shit that you have absolutely no basis for in hopes of getting the circle jerk upvote. 
---
My fiancee and I had our first daughter in November and are both looking forward to classic. There is nothing to stop you from playing with friends, being married, and having a kid. None of those things are mutually exclusive. 
---
Kinda a weird take, but maybe consider resto druid. My retail vanilla and private server vanilla experience is that they are hard to find and keep -- so a) they get funneled good gear pretty much as soon as they hit 60 because there isn't a ton of competition for it and b) they get automatic spots in 40-mans because of the above-mentioned scarcity and utility.
---
They might not be the fastest to level per se, but you might find that an easier class to level (mage for instance) might face far more competition in trying to get geared and get core raid spots. As a resto druid, basically raid-logging and you wish to do might be much more realistic much earlier on than for other classes.
---
wtf am i looking at?
---
I had a talk with my old RPG and MMORPG friends and we came to the conclusion that people are too damn lazy and selfish today. Shocking I know.
---
We decided we HAD to change this and started a weekly RPG game again like we did when younger. We get together in person and not the lazy ass choice of video conferencing. 
---
It's the best choice we've made in years if not decades. I have to see if 1 or 2 are willing to return to Classic Wow. I suspect at least 1 will. RPGs have always been out focus however.
---
NEVER give up on getting together in real life with friends. To only have friends through the internet is a soulless endeavour and the beginning of your social and emotional decline. 
---
If you don't see it now, you will eventually.
---
You need to be 60 to learn he schematic
---
That's a very good point, never thought about it. Although the server's i've been playing are mostly EU (Nostalrious, Light's Hope, K3) they all felt alive and kicking even past midnight EU times.
---
WoW can be a hobby or a vice. I plan on making it a vice

What idiot wouldn't use all his CD's when he takes on that many people?

Pathologist, pretty early video maker (warcraftmovies and such) in Vanilla wow. He had a lot of videos.

Is there a way to donate to your cause? 
---
This is amazing &lt;3
---
Looking at the number of upvotes on your comment, it seems that people start to understand that a no level cap, no QoLs is gaining traction over TBC.
---
An OSRS voting system should be in Classic (at some point along the road).
---
Basically, people (still) rather have TBC instead new content, because they don't trust ActiBlizz. I get it. I don't trust them either.
---
Still, between a TBC (with daily quests, shrunk raid size, 2 difficulties, flying mounts, mix up races and classes for both factions, neutral city, resilience, sockets, etc. etc.) and an OSRS voted new content for Classic, even if I don't trust ActiBliz...I would prefer the new content.
---
It says hundreds of days?
---
Grow a pair 'MadMike' lool sensitive little boy
---
Strobolights gave me cancer
---
Granted, after you attack a gnome as an alliance an ability pop for all the gnomes in the area called "rally the gnomes" allowing them to teleport to you and attack you back.
---
yeah if those times are est you'd fit right into a normal raid window for a west coast guild
---
RP in WoW was always somewhat self-contained within guilds.  You joined an RP guild and RPed within that guild.  Sometimes you'd find another similar guild and then your guilds would mingle.  A lot of people joined RP-PVP servers because they had (at the time) some name rules so you weren't ganked by DickGuzzler69.  
---
Everyone who was on an RPPVP wanted to PvP in world, otherwise they'd join an RP server.  
---
I hope we see at least a few RPPVP servers at launch.
---
Of course you would. You might get a little present for your efforts, though... like a pretty in the mailbox or something like that. 
---
Night Elf for running back to your corpse faster lol
---
Same, though I'm just an 1800 total UIM on the Zulrah grind
---
Have to disagree. It is like daily quests. Repeatable. Very repeatable. Especially when there's no Classic content.
---
Just gotta know the difference. 😉
---
You missed the Mage Portals that are huge (HUGE!) in saving travel time. Without a central hub with portals, the portals will sometimes save you half an hour of traveling (i.e. walking, flying, walking to Zep, waiting for Zep, flying with Zep, walking in OG). Also setting up a macro is a something that takes about 30 seconds and then you are done
---
Also just some random thoughts: Druids can only heal poison, so good luck in Strat living with the 30 minute debuffs on everyone
---
WL portal saves a lot of hassle. You do not only get the Class Mount (which is obviously absolutely awesome) but also the access to a really epic class quest that is only comparable to what Hunters and Priests get. But they need a raid for this. 
---
And just one minor thing: you always refer to PvE = Raids. IMO that's one of the major differences to retail. You can do cool stuff without raiding. That's where gameplay as a ranged DPS is fun, but it's not only Frostbolt or Shadow Bolt, but CC, Kiting, panicking. 
---
Yeah, I'm sorry you had to experience such a downfall of a once great MMORPG. I count my blessings that I left midway through Cata.
---
Not everyone will get to Naxx though, and even still, hunters are great for MC and all of progress and early farming in BWL. I'd say that's still a good option for those who know they won't venture much further, if at all.

It's crazy how the rank 14 2hand sword/axe only had +1% critical strike. 
---
T3 is BiS healing gear. T1 and T2 youll only use if you dont have preraid BiS gear. Theres literally no pieces that are good for straight healing. T2 you might use if your guild likes a pally AoE tank.
---
Honestly two handed dps arms beats furies in most 5 mans, not on bosses but you wreck trash so so quickly
---
The client clearly runs pretty smoothly. The servers are what's lagging here
---
Tauren Warrior. Can’t go wrong. Top dps throughout all of vanilla and good in pvp. 
---
I'm willing to bet that's a one in a million person. 
---
If I roll mage it's either going to be ChilaryCritn or Cinnabon
---
The subscriber numbers peaked and declined pretty much exactly after those tools were introduced so they didnt gain any casuals but lost them.
---
Couldn't be Vanilla without it 
---
Implying this is a loss?
---
Your Battle Net account can have multiple WOW accounts attached to it.
---
You can pay for a character transfer between those accounts.
---
With three accounts. If you get to 60 in a month you have 3x subscription cost for three accounts. Then add the cost of two transfers if you want to transfer them all to the same account afterwards.
---
It's not known if transferring characters between accounts will be possible in Classic.
---
Exactly. 
---
You hit the nail on the head.  It will take longer.  But, Time is often overlooked and impact that it has.  Think about it.
---
If MC now takes 3 hours to clear.  And subsequently, BWL, etc.  If you want to raid everything, you'll be raiding 4+ nights a week.  There will no longer be this idea of "We'll just farm Thunderfury while we clear everything else".
---
This concept of "fresh" from a player perspective will be done.  When people get into Naxx, no longer will they enter "fresh".  They will be more tired.  More jaded.  Because if you're raiding 4 times a week, how much time do you have to farm consumables and get gold?
---
Things become grindier - just like it was in Vanilla when the content originally came out.  And that makes all the difference in the world.
---
On top of that, Bosses taking longer to die, changes up BiS.  Mana matters again.  Survivability matters again.  If you're a mage wearing greens and speccing arcane power, LOL.
---
But make no mistake.  This is NOT about making it harder.  Just more authentic.
---
Time is money friend.
---
Hunter doesnt have many expenses in terms of consumables. People say arrows are expensive but theyre not really if youre engi. Otherwise, you dont need any flasks, only 1 Elixir and Mana Oil and Sagefish on long progression fights.
---
Paladins are also pretty light on consumes. Flask isnt really necessary and all you really need is Mana Oil.
---
And literally world buffed to stomp pugs in AB... he has a bunch of pots on and then Songflower buff lol...
---
Racials are not important for leveling. If I had to pick one I’d say undead because cannibalize reduces downtime. But you always have first aid. 
---
Still raid viable. I accept this change. 
---
Won't be an event it's the server cap it stays static
---
Yeah, you have to keep in mind: every dps spec is viable. You can have 40 Druids and clear MC. It’s just good to have an idea of where and when classes perform at their best. I always tell newbies that Hunters should be their first class, because they’re very well-balanced.
---
That’s my hope. I’m thinking either hunter or Druid; hunter easier casual farm and leveling, and if I can make raids a hunter or two is essential and not that gear demanding, where a Druid is still somewhat fast leveling and not played as much but farms slower. 
---
I agree. Thanks for the comment? It was a good time, I loved it. 
---
How exactly do your role-play getting corpse-camped at the Nessy camp, or ganked by RogueLordxx in the middle of the Lakeshire Townhall (because he camps Redridge 12 hours/day)?
---
All of the healers can solo farm DME. Just google.
---
Yeah, forgot to add pet getting blinded. 
---
But unlike daily quests it only takes a few seconds as opposed to a few minutes!
---
If you want to melee and want to be in a serious/hard core/good raid guild, you can only play a rogue or a warrior.
---
If you are planning on raiding with a bunch of friends or already have a more accepting premade guild, you can get by as any melee.  You probably will suck in terms of DPS compared to the "real" dps classes, but if you enjoy it and you're guild is cool with it, who cares. You might be able to find a random guild willing to accept any class in order to fill their 40 man roster, but they likely won't be a very "good" guild in terms of being able to kill bosses. 
---
In terms of being able to cross between pvp and eve really well, again you are kinda stuck to rogue and warrior.  Enhance shaman is pretty strong pvp, but they are pretty bad for pve. Pally is pretty meh at pvp besides their "lol can't kill me" antics, and potential reckoning bomb 1 shots, but absolutely horrid in pve. Feral is again pretty strong in pvp, but horrible in pve because they can't use their bleeds to dps. 
---
For warrior, you will generally be top tier dps all along the way of raids, but some fights really suck for melee.  For pvp, they can actually REALLY suck if they don't have a dedicated healer/cleanser. If you try to join a random bg and expect to just walk in and dominate, I'd say most of the time you won't.  If you queue with a group, you can achieve your wildest dreams. 
---
For rogue, also, generally pretty top tier dps. Same issue with bad fights for melee. Additional issues with some bosses being immune to poisons, so your dps will hurt even worse.  Towards later raids, warriors, mages and warlocks seem to out dps rogues.  I could be misremembering that a bit, but even still, top 4 dps. As for pvp, world pvp is awesome/funny because you generally get to dictate the flow of the fight.  Instanced pvp, its okay. You can handle the special objectives or the stealth caps of the bg, but you aren't great in group fights.  Yes, you can definitely nuke down the healer or a mage, but you'll likely die right after them.  If you do kill the healer, your team can probably win the fight, but not as fun as bouncing in and out of combat like current retail (to me at least).
---
Having the hardest time trying to choose.
---
My classic character when the game came out and favorite class: Hunter.
---
Or my favorite role to fill in games (Overwatch, SWTOR, etc) the tank, and therefore: Warrior. 
---
Tanking in classic is kind of insane. Well in general it's insane at lease to me. Watching a bunch of videos on tanks in classic just scares the hell out of me. But I like being the tank :/ 
---
That’s pretty awesome. He really farmed them hard. 
---
The only spec that doesnt really have any itemization for it is Enhance Shaman. The rest of the specs can get decent gear for PvP.
---
If we only had the data of average retail vanilla raiders' gear, rotations, consumables, specs and general behaviour/movement. People *sucked* in comparison to today, in every regard possible.
---
There will still be players like that who want to try out classic and maybe even raid. Let them have the experience we had and let them suck at the game and still clear some content. And what about the people who just don't have the time to optimize everything and farm every consumable possible? You know, like most people back in the day? You want to gatekeep them out of the introductory raid?
---
Don't forget that vanilla isn't just for you and me. Many players are excited to raid MC who have no idea how to do it and there are players who want to enh shammy / ret pally or oomkin. I say: Let them. MC wasn't ever a mechanically interesting raid ever. It was a grind. And it was fun because it was the first big raid you clear, and you were allowed to suck. The challenge for hardcore players comes after.
---
battle shout creates threat for each party memeber buffed even if its being reapplied and also this includes hunter and lock pets. so using demo shout with 2-3 mobs creates less rage than battle shouting 5+ grp members. thunderclap is 20 rage for a max of 4 mobs that equals 2 battleshouts for 5+ friendlies. demo is only good for more enemies than there are friendlies. i dont think youre understanding
---
He still had an evasion and a blind up by the end of it so technically he didnt blow all his cds. Being able to get out of range of the blizzard after the vanish and land the stun was a nice move though. 
---
I actually quite enjoyed Stormrage if I'm remembering correctly. But I think Knaak's War of The Ancients trilogy were actually my favorite of his stuff.
---
2015: "Pserver players are Warcraft's most dedicated fans, they love the game so much that they play on pirate servers, and put up with bugs, GM corruption, and having their server be under risk of shutdown any moment."
---
2019: " Pservers players are shitters who don't care about the game."
---
Ooookay.
---
Warlocks have the potential to do amazing DPS our damage ceiling is higher than mages. Its just we don't have built in hit to be consistent enough and no natural threat reduction. You an crit 5 times in a row or miss five times in a row or sometimes. It really comes down to RNG sadly but on paper we hit harder. Late game warlock vanilla is early games BC in terms of numbers 5k+ crits etc
---
&gt; The fact that they went ahead and removed almost all the PvE elements strongly suggests that the silent majority were in Warsong Gulch instead.
---
The reason they removed the PvE elements was because they didn't fucking work in a PvP battleground.
---
See, also: Leechers fishing and herbing all match long.
---
Ooof.
---
I think he meant to say that he has previously leveled 3-4 warriors through dungeon grinding with friends healing him. 
---
The ultimate goal of Vanilla pvp isn't winning, it's farming rep and honor.
---
And the best way to do that in AV is to lose quickly.
---
I've met amazing people in private servers. You won't be alone buddy.
---
I’m unsure of the point of your comment is why.
---
"I'll probably level 3 or 4 warriors"
---
What...what are you?!
---
I’m not sure, maybe it’s an indication to go outside or eat. I’d honestly need a good one of those every now and then or I wouldn’t get away from my computer lol. 
---
Orc is better.
---
That’s what I thought but maybe I didn’t know something. I guess a paladin could do it?
---
When I played a hunter in vanilla I definitely remember it being a thing but that was a long time ago so i cant remember specifics. Tips out had a video talking with some hunter guy considered to be one of the best hunters ever on the private server world discussing hunter talents for leveling and pve and such and i do believe i remember them discussing the survival thing where he confirmed it. It's quite a long video and I dont remember a time mark for that discussion but might be worth looking into. It's hard to say though because any information taken from the private server workd should be taken with a grain of salt as you cant be certain it will be 100% the same in classic but based off my memory from vanilla and that video I do believe it to be a thing. Perhaps theres more specific factors involved than just being a kve a certain agility mark though
---
Im just going to say this here even though ive said it multiple times and I dont think anyone notices.  Trust me, ive been a warrior since vanilla wow beta and done a lot of top tier raiding.  Fury is NOT good in vanilla until youre into aq.  Even then, it just starts to match up to arms around then.  Fury is significantly more difficult to gear into as there is hardly any hit gear out there.  Not only that but your best 1h's go to the tank first.  
---
Even better is to win quickly.
---
Dude sapper bae!
---
Everyone thought nelf passive death run speed is trash but little did they know it's free 50% mount since lvl 1!
---
Of course. Back in vanilla and tbc there was a guy multiboxing 40 Shamans and he was solo’ing raids with them. 
---
Sure, but the best way to win quickly is to not defend... Which gives the other team an opportunity to also win quickly.
---
So, you just zerg to Van/Drek, and ignore the other team + side objectives.
---
Great response, very helpful!
---
Basically what i was looking for. I've been playing rogue and having a good time. 
---
None of my old wow friends will be joining me in classic so i will be looking to join a semi hardcore/hardcore guild.
---
Looking alot like warrior or rogue then. 
---
Any thought or comparisons between mages and locks? leaning towards lock if i go ranged
---
Is the 80g an estimation of material costs or is that the cost for using the 'Evil Soothsaying for Dummies' book?
---
Thank you! Will keep this in mind :)
---
Couldn't he just stealth away after the last one? I mean he'd be out of combat.
---
Alliance nearly always has stronger RP. I'm not suggesting it may the RP style you like, but you'll likely have a better chance at meeting those with similar interests.
---
Horde does tend to be more PvP oriented and has more Alliance locations to exploit in the leveling process as Alliance has Horde areas. Horde also has better leveling Flight Path locations and this has a profound impact.
---
PvE servers often tend to trend toward slightly large Alliance populations due to raid focused players typically taking the easier progression faction. Alliance has more quest lines and better scripted events too which enhances the RP aspect more. Horde has a more backwater feel on purpose but is hard for many who like classical fantasy to endure.
---
I'd wait to see the faction spread per server however as it grows after launch. There is no way to predict it other than knowing the general trends.

Tfw in 2019 scrubs are still complaining about usage of cooldowns. eRmErGeRD

It's part of the class, Newton.
---
Yeah Orc does 1-2% more dps but OP made it sound like Tauren was his favorite race. 
---
Rogue it is then. Or Mage? 
---
I played a hunter in vanilla. The ranged blind spot is awful. Being far enough but not too far. Not being too close but oh that Rogue is shanking me and I can't do @#$! about it.

I’m definitely interested in this. Adding you on discord.
---
Its technically Summer in mid September lol. August would be a treat comparatively.
---
Correlation doesn't mean causation. 
---
I agree whole heartedly with the consumer of a product. But this post is not by any means helping drive a positive change. You think shit talking a company makes them change their buisness practices? This is a shitty attempt at reddit karma. It probably even worsens the consumer position in that now the consumer just seems like an asshole and the company isn't as bad as this guy is saying.

If you take rez sickness at a different spirit healer it teleports you back to the graveyard you started at.

Druids kindve sucked in Vanilla? I know they were awesome in BC and resto was OP as fuck in Wotlk. I LOVED leveling my alt Druid in BC I loved the quests for forms. Would it be worth it to roll one in Classic? I never reached max level in Vanilla to know what they were like in raids. I Vaguely remember them leveling in instances. I’m between Mage, warlock (always played a Mage-Lock though) or a Druid or shammy (In all my years of playing WoW I’ve never played a shammy so something new might be fun). Thoughts? 
---
I remember finally pulling ahead in the DPS meters after getting Fel Infused Leggings &amp; the +shadow damage gloves &amp; ring from BWL. Still not quite as consistent as a Mage, but two Shadowbolt crits in a row would wreck. Though three in a row usually meant I pulled aggro...
---
There's going to be all types of people playing.  There'll be something for everyone.
---
Summer doesn't begin until June 21. 
---
We're all stuck in time :) plenty of new folks to meet and old friends to bond with.
---
Pallys can double pull though and clear all 4 packs in less than 3 minutes.
---
Honestly is very likely.
---
I don't know enough about the two in vanilla.  I know they both have their strengths in pvp.  Mages with constant slows and roots, and a ranged counter spell. Warlocks with constant fears and sustain, and either a felhunter interrupt or a succubus seduce for cc.  I can't really speak to their pve potential.  All I really know is a lot of warlocks HATED the soul stone issue with raiding. Don't really recall if that was ever addressed or made easier in vanilla by patch 1.12.
---
I wont go into survival, since its obvious and too long to detail every buff and gear needed. 
---
However, I will talk about threat. Threat is produced by healing a few rogues/warriors who are wearing Crystal of Zin-Malor. Additionally, life-tapping locks can be healed in conjunction with designated players who are using demonic Rune/Sapper Charge. Believe it or not people/pets standing in fire can actually help us. This can be taken a step higher, with raid members being MC'ed and receiving Curse of Doom and healing them afterwards.

Me and a bunch of other priest tanks are creating a guide. For the moment, here the gear sheet to tie you over: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pC0engJ0IieOAA1K1EnguvVF0RFLAFEhaf0-e7Okkxg/edit?usp=sharing

This is what I was thinking too.
---
&gt;"We want vanilla raids to be harder!"
---
&gt;"okay, just run with less people then"
---
&gt;"REEEE RETAIL RETAIL!!"
---
Nice.
---
I learned this the hard way.  I thought I was smart when I died in the Wetlands and ran as a ghost all the way to IF.  I think I logged off for the night when I got ported back.
---
You need to watch [Perplexity](https://www.youtube.com/user/Purp1exity/videos)'s clips!
---
Haha yeah he also had pocket healers pretty much all the time. At least one. 
---
I just resubbed for the first time since cata. The new water is soooo nice in comparison 
---
So?
---
Why the "lol", this is a very serious consideration.
---
I'm playing as horde on the server I'm on (my only alliance character is a Paladin, so...not NE) and there's been soooooo many times I've said "man, I wish I was a NE right now".
---
aka high raid utility
---
(aka yes, it burns a little)
---
I have heard alot of complaining regarding the soul shards. Probably best for me to just stick to melee!
---
Thanks again :)
---
When do you stream?
---
I only remember that sheeping a mounted player resulted in a sheep on a mount.
---
Stormwind was being rebuilt, Lordaeron didn't abandon them, by the time Arthas was seiging Quel'Thalas he had already killed his father (which was basically a deathblow for the kingdom), ravaged the countryside, and killed the last few knights of the silver hand (including Uther). Sylvanas was just a ranger-general, and not of the royal family.
---
The only point in the lore that really pushed them away from the old alliance was the whole thing with Lord Garithos treating them like shit. This seems like a weird reason to abandon your oldest standing alliances and join up with orcs and trolls who had literally been murdering your people by the thousands less than thirty years ago.
---
Oh hey, i stream usualy Sunday - Monday 21:00 + 1 GTM. By the rules of this reddit i can post my stream link while i stream, so im online atm :)
---
Alright, got it! Sorry for making you stop the game to reply haha, thanks a lot for the quick reply.
---
Hi, my name is Skribs, and I'm an altoholic.
---
(If this were TBC, and Paladins had a taunt, I'd mix and match my characters a lot more).
---
Well nice words and wishes of a few dont have an impact on ruthless businessmen, only on the passionate devs that worked out of their garage.
---
Bombarding them with downvotes on the diablo immortal trailer and ridiculing them at blizzcon is not the nicest style imaginable, but it absolutly had more impact then 1000 civilized posts on a forum that only a few CMs read (and they fired the best one ironically)
---
And then in Legion it was moved to the Broken Isles.
---
Could not agree more! I spent way too much time in Azeroth during my BS and high school and boy did my grades suffer. But now I am a 27 y old with a 7 month old kid, a house and like you 2 Msc and a demanding job. Im hesitant but hopeful
---
Honestly if all you want is best for solo leveling, its NElf for the wisp. No joke its so handy. But human wepskill op for end game.
---
The video in this post is instanced too. The 40v40 South Shore vs Terran Mill brawl is also instanced and is still a total lag fest. 
---
Because every single TBC server has been utter trash. TBC was all about the 5mans and the raiding. The rest of it was pretty meh compared to vanilla, but that was the content TBC nailed. Private servers have yet to get this part right, that's why they keep failing.
---
Clearly you didn’t play vanilla. It’s part of the struggle. Accept it. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/awsypi/shadowform_physical_dmg_reduction/ehsf4xe/
---
I think i just had a damn seizure 
---
I too feel it. 
---
Whatever makes you feel superior. 
---
I mean, they could just *not* release it in the summer and say they pushed the release date back. It’s not like they have to give a reason why. Even if they did it would be a bullshit PR answer anyways. 
---
They can do whatever they want. 
---
I think it's important to note that everyone has different levels of "responsibilities" in this context. Not everyone has the aspirations to complete "2 Master degrees, multiple certifications, ect." As a bottom line, I think the better advice is to simply not change your current lifestyle that works for you when Classic launches. Just try to take care of yourself and your family if you have one. Don't ruin your life over a video game and like Nomad said, if you have addictive tendencies, it might be best to forego the temptation to "just play for a little longer." ESPECIALLY if you are that person but now see yourself with family responsibilities.
---
There's too much dank flowing thru my blood to feel that. I have a good job, and a fiance. I play basketball, hockey and rocket league. I can juggle WoW into this.

A lot of top tiered tanks rolled with a fury / prot hybrid spec.  Something like 5/30/16? I’d have to go back and look at vanilla warrior specs but it was a good combo to have flury as a warrior while also hitting all the main important prot spec points.  
---
That was once you were geared in full tier 2 or better. Prior to having that gear most main tanks and off tanks focused on grabbing at least 31 points in prot.  
---
As the 3rd - 4th tank in my Naxx guild it was important to still do decent damage when not tanking. Gear was so much more important than most warrior prot talent points in vanilla.  
---
I think the troll health regen is negligible. You’re not going to stand there between mobs and regen back to 100%. You’re going to right click that food and sit down back to 100%. 
---
I think canni is going to save you money in the long run by giving you a free right click to regen hp every so often
---
Long time rogue here. I don't' care about killing my opponent as much as just annoying them to death. Because I am in stealth most of the time I will be able to pick my battles. You will almost never kill me and I will pop out of stealth and CC you over and over until you make a mistake, get lucky or rage quit.
---
Everquest and pubg
---
Honestly it sounds like you want to be a rogue.
---
Shammies were really a healing class in classic so if you don't want to be resto then, Shammies are basically out. Pallys were heals + buffs, they never got the threat potential of warriors or druids. DH of course didn't exist.
---
Fury warrior would also be a contender but Rogue would be higher dps (assuming players of equal skill + gear), and Rogue is easier to level as well.
---
If you're really just interested in landing a spot in a raid then a priest will be the highest demand, although a resto shammy will also be highly desired. If you want to be melee dps in raid then either fury warrior or rogue are more than viable, but you'll be facing more competition for spots.
---
Paladin for the tank spec and AoE in consecrate.
---
Preist for AoE holy nova.
---
Forsooth I do declare,  a member of that foule Horde is shivving my kidneys!
---
of course. but you can speculate all you want. the truth we have to work with is them saying it is coming out in the summer, twice. what evidence do you have that it won't come out then?
---
MC was alway like this people were just 13 and retarded back in the day.
---
I remember a line of paladin healers wearing light-orge and wielding ice barbed spear. 
---
That's one of my big concerns. There are a ton of people that play retail solely to RP. I'm not sure much of that crowd would switch to classic. Retail has mogs, more races, more zones, RP-usable toys, etc. 
---
Classic's biggest appeal would be the timeline and obviously gameplay - but I don't know if that's even appealing to the stand around SMC/SW/Org all day RPer.
---
We play what makes us happy, even if nostalgia hides some of the flaws. I still play classic EverQuest from time to time. I played that game in middle school and now I'm playing it as an adult who almost has middle school aged children.
---
We have no idea.
---
Personally I'd say it's likely that rare mobs will all be there from server start. So you could potentially make a raid of lowbies and go kill Prince Nazjak for the trinket.
---
I leveled Prot. I simply enjoy the rotation and like to take my time as well as always be ready to tank instances.
---
I am a very casual player and I likes me a nice shield and sword. Pair me with a healer and I never die. (And neither do the mobs)
---
Undead or Troll for sure. Troll is really only good early on when spirit matters. The closer you get to 60 the more undead shines since it's abilities never stop being awesome.
---
With actual vanilla server caps dynamic respawns are not necessary. So there is no reason to believe there will ever be dynamic spawns. Even if they tweak server caps I can't see them using a system like dynamic respawn that breaks so many other things.
---
Honestly, play classic and go in blind as fuck... Don't look stuff up just explore. I wish I could experience that magic again. I'm gonna love classic again (loved it on private servers too) but I'll never love it quite as much as that first time. It was unlike anything else. Modern wow for better or worse depending on your tastes feels mostly like every other generic mmo out there imo.  It can be fun and bad xpac to xpac but it rarely feels unique anymore. Vanilla has that feeling.
---
He could but will just blow a cd for nothing 
---
It all depends how much spirit you have. People have spirit sets in bag to swap into when eating or traveling as well.
---
If theyre not there immediately, they are likely to spawn in after their spawn timer.
---
In PVP? Enhance shamans with decent gear used to wreck in PVP.  I don’t remember many people at all playing elemental shaman in vanilla. It was either enhance or resto.  A few from time to time in top tiered guilds player elemental, but you were stacked in tier 2+ gear.  
---
I'll make a rogue when classic comes out but I still can't decide if I should go dagger or sword spec. Playing with daggers seem to be really interesting but backstab takes 60 energy and that's a lot compared to hemorrhage sword spec. 
---
Can you guys help me with this? I seriously can't decide...
---
I don’t have to present any evidence. I’m just telling you they blizzard isn’t held to some truth omertà based on them originally setting a release date of summer. 
---
Obviously they aren’t confident because they gave an entire season 25% of the year to which they have release it. Quite a ducking window allowing for one hell of a margin of error. 
---
They could have been confident and said “July 27th” or something but didn’t. 
---
I've heard this, never actually seen anyone do it.
---
I'd rather have a couple stacks of food than an entire bag of spirit gear.
---
Blunt, but this is spot on. Even moreso on a PvE-RP server. Most RPers will use more traditional pen and paper combat resolution (Emotes/Rolls) as opposed to PvP. As someone who loves a good RPvP duel/small-scale combat, it's pretty crushing.  
---
Beyond that, many people will straight up /ignore or send hate mail for even suggesting you use in game mechanics to resolve RP. 
---
I'm just worried about longevity and the possibility of a class being over populated.
---
The time it takes to level to 60 makes me nervous about picking a class because i only want to do it once.
---
Sounds to me like i cant go wrong with a warrior due to the fact they tank as well. 
---
I got a few months to decide, hopefully private server play will convince me soon enough.
---
&gt;Stormwind was being rebuilt, Lordaeron didn't abandon them, by the time Arthas was seiging Quel'Thalas he had already killed his father (which was basically a deathblow for the kingdom), ravaged the countryside, and killed the last few knights of the silver hand (including Uther).
---
Ok, I thought that Stormwind was still being rebuilt, and I didn't mean to imply that Lorderan abandoned them, they fought side by side, but the Alliance was/is more than just humans. Dwarves made an appearance in the game (via the human campaign) and afaik did not come to the aid of the Elves at all, despite having their own kingdom and everything. Now of course we didn't know of Ironforge or anything then, at least, I don't think? but the fact remains that the BElves felt abandoned by the Alliance, not just the humans, when they needed them most, and it was Sylvanas who, even after death, was the one to reach out her hand to help them. 
---
&gt;This seems like a weird reason to abandon your oldest standing alliances and join up with orcs and trolls who had literally been murdering your people by the thousands less than thirty years ago.
---
Refresh my memory if you don't mind, but the Forsaken started off as Neutral w/ the Orcs, Trolls and Taruen, and when TBC launced so did the BElves, they were only friendly w/ the Forsaken and vice versa. So, it's not like when the BElves joined they were all buddy buddy, there was some tension there among all of them (which SUCKED for a rep grind if you wanted another races mount). 
---
Factor in that after it's all said and done, the Forsaken were by far the closest race/city closest to them so geographically it made sense to join w/ them too, but, that's so little a factor I'm not even really sure why I'm mentioning it lol. 
---
&gt;I'm looking forward to more moderation.
---
You're gonna be disappointed.
---
Unless you like being banned by other players for no reason.
---
Shhhhh
---
imo you don't notice it at all. it won't save you money because you'll still need to eat just about as regularly and in combat, it would be roughly on par with the HP bonus you get from being a tauren.
---
if health is really your concern while leveling, then if anything the cannibalize ability would be one of the more useful since it's a free meal every couple of minutes, saving you precious silver to buy a mount with.
---
What the fuck does Xiao even mean? Why are literally half of them called it?
---
i wish that if you'd cannibalize a corpse as an undead, parts of the corps become your own like you gain muscles of an orc or the brain of a gnome.
---
Enjoy your reckoning that doesnt stack based on a sit macro.
---
Well most of them will be focused on instance leveling, or at the very least be part of a duo.  That's a completely different experience.
---
I did not use sheep anywhere near enough when I played a mage. 12 year old me though it was a super shitty move in PvP because it made people just regen all their HP. 
---
35 yards is still a pretty large range.  
---
I am definitely looking forward to people being banned for "no reason".
---
Perhaps consider a Druid. They always seemed similar to Hunters to me with the high skill cap and high outplay potential. They also can satisfy your tanking itch, being very good dungeon tanks and somewhat viable off-tanks in raids. 
---
Im also having a really hard time. I know I dont really want to play a Pally, Priest, or Rogue, but beyond that I have no idea
---
Maybe not so much when it's you, mate.
---
Almost in the other category there :-D (not pony)
---
40v40 SS vs TM plays just fine.
---
I thought they fixed this?
---
Good luck...Blizz already said that this will not be available in Classic
---
I don't see why its a bad thing. All it really does is save a lot of levelling time. Not even much more expensive if you factor in the fact that your 2nd subscription would probably be spent entirely leveling your 2nd char anyway. 
---
I'm not sure which class to pick, but am leaning hunter since the downsides of other classes seems too much for what i like. I want an engaging or fun pve rotation, so that seems to exclude warlocks and amges since they spam 1 spell. I dont want to heal so that takes out priest, paladin, shaman, and druid. I dont want to do rogue since it just doesnt interest me as ive never liked stleath rogue type classes. That leaves me hunter and warrior, i mainly want to do warrior but the awful leveling experience and fact that theyre not even good at 60 until they get geared seems like a huge hurdle that might put a poor taste in my mouth playing classic which i dont want to do early, so it seems warrior as a second class seems better. That really just leaves hunter which are nice since i like pets, their pve rotation is interesting, but the only thing is their dps scaling into endgame is so poor and i dont want to feel super weak as i gear up. I guess im just looking for a justification to go warrior and just grit my teeth through leveling and early gearing, but i truly dont want it to cause me to quit playing early on with how bad it is.
---
99% sure you always ressed at the spirit healer you talked to.
---
I know MangOS core private servers do what you've described
---
Didn't say that before.
---
This.  1.12.1 is going to be the *basis* the debs are using for most balance changes/talents/etc. That does bot mean they are going to allow bugs/exploits.
---
Officially they will be releasing classic as patch 1.13 as they said during the Classic WoW announcement a year ago.   1.13 is going to be a Frankenstein patch.  1.12.1 as the basis with probably a few fixes and adjustments to things they'll have to address when developing in a new modernized environment.
---
Misunderstood you're original comment. Unclear. 
---
No no, shhhh.
---
#YES OP, IT TOTALLY WORKS AND IS AMAZING IN EVERY WAY.
---
Weak auras causes a lot of lag but you can track it with an addon. I slimmed down my WA and it helped with input lag
---
Zigmagear?
---
I see a lot more horde hate, and when I look at youtube creators I see that most of them are alliance. When I last played WoW with my ex he made me play alliance with him because he couldn't stand the idea of playing horde, talked constantly about all of the horrible things the horde have done in the story, and went far out of his way to kill any horde player he saw. (To be fair, I do the same when I'm playing horde)
---
Of course, I think this is 1) perspective bias (you notice people who are different than you more than you notice people who are like you, so it's easy to feel like you're in a minority) and 2) if you play with a faction you're going to see people who like that faction and hate the other faction. It's not exactly an objective sample size.
---
Wasn’t after that niche lol
---
Did they move entirely to a cloud setup? I thought they still used blades
---
I wish you couldn't attack players more than 10 levels lower than you.
---
Does the /sit to get crit by mobs work in classic? for retri paladins ofc.
---
Titanian? Titanianish?
---
I've played under modern retail moderation. It's never been me because I don't screw around spewing edgy garbage for kicks.
---
&gt;81 hp, goes for the gank anyway.
---
What madlad.
---
&lt;3
---
how do paladins fare in world pvp? will a holy paladin be able to kill something in 1v1? or do they have to bubble hearth each time?
---
What class to pick, simplified:
---
* Whatever you enjoy playing
---
We are ALL killing time. The value of your time is yours to decide. I feel bad sometimes too, but I know I won't be playing the game 16 hours a day like I did when I was 16. But every single adult wastes time doing one thing or another.
---
To me I think of retail WoW as playing with “God Mode” on. You basically can’t die while leveling, unlimited gold with little effort and you can fly. 
---
You're going to pay for 2 accounts?  F that.
---
This is a perfect post for me. I can't tell ya'll how excited i am to play classic, i just dont know what class to play! My choices ranked so far are...
---
1. Druid
---
2. Warrior
---
3. Rogue
---
I wanted to roll a melee class as my last classes in legion/bfa were priest/mage and i wanted to try being up close and personal this time around. My favorite thing ever in Wow was tanking with my deathknight. I'm leaning hard towards druids, as i know they are capable of doing every role in dungeons and i love that versatility, and although people keep saying "jack of all trades, master of none", I am a bit worried about the amount of effort ill have to put in late game to be viable.
---
My question for any druid players is how viable are they for tanking during the leveling process/ are their any core items that i HAVE to get that might make it easier?
---
Second question i did have if anyone knows, I know that Tauren have extra melee range on their attacks/being attacked. Does that also apply while in animal forms? Thanks fam 
---
Lol. mage are among the most useful in organized wpvp. their control abilities are the absolute best. they can dominate whole fights.
---
I'll dig up a good video to showcase a mage and will edit this post when I find it. 
---
Hello everybody! **LF Alliance raiding guild. US, west coast. PVP**
---
**About me:**
---
 I'm a 33 year old male on the west coast (AZ). My experience with WoW has been Vanilla to Cata and a few months of Legion. With most of my hardcore raiding in Vanilla (AQ40/Naxx). I am personally a min-maxer who takes pride in his own performance, that does not mean I'm looking for a serious hardcore raiding guild. Personally I would like to be in a semi-casual raiding guild who is okay with not being server first, but somewhere in the middle. I am looking for a melee dps raiding spot; Warrior, Rogue, even Ret Pally lol. I am fine rolling any of these 3 classes. And would even tank or heal in 5 mans leading up to raiding.
---
If I sound like a good match for your guild. Please send a PM my way! :) 
---
My [video](https://youtu.be/7VwGQPgBjOg).
---
It's still a coin toss between warrior and rogue here, imo.
---
Most raids will be running with a lot of both, so you will be less affected by overpopulation than, say, a hunter.
---
oh okay. no evidence. just baseless claims. gotcha. activison-blizzard isn't what it once was. the "when it's ready" mentality doesn't sit to well with the board of directors they have to answer to. there are goals they much accomplish/expectations for each quarter. that is all driven by strategic product releases. they obviously want classic out in the summer quarter. to use overwatch as an example. the first release info we got from it was "spring 2016" because they set the goals for a major release during the spring quarter. then in march they gave the exact may release date. I bet something similar will happen with classic.
---
Dagger's burst damage is far better in solo world pvp.
---
As much as I like Hemo more, your damage isn't as good until you get absurdly good 1h.  In Vanilla, Hemo just does base weapon damage, + some crit multiplier off lethality,
---
"PvE rotation is ok but I personally find keeping Slice and Dice up to be annoying"
---
hahah yeah having to use it every 20-30 seconds is just a total nightmare =/
---
As a 27 y/o guy with a job, a car, girlfriend (soon to be married) I can tell you one thing - do things YOU like and YOU enjoy. Nobody should EVER tell you what to do in your life. If you enjoy it, good. If you don't, change something. Just try. Apparently you need some validation too, so try to get a girlfriend maybe? Or maybe a better job? Or just buy something fancy or go on a trip and meet someone? And then enjoy Classic with us :)
---
Nice and simple. I'm from London, UK (male 32) and looking for some locals to play casually with, probably horde. No rushing, just a normal paced plod levelling together. Reply if you're keen! =)
---
You're misunderstanding the crux of his argument not the other way around. In MODERN WOW, players don't back cap, players don't do 40v40 brawls with the exception of the SSvsTM. Therefore Blizz don't assign the server resources necessary for a 40v40 to any instances except the SS vs TM brawl, which btw, doesn't lag.
---
He is saying that in classic, Blizz will accomodate by providing more on demand resourcing to handle these more frequent, more expected world pvp events in classic. 
---
I can't decide between rogue and warrior. I enjoy tanking, and i like the idea of playing with the notion that all my hard work will pay off in the endgame, but on the other hand, i love the RPG elements behind rogues, and stealth is an overall pretty OP ability. 
---
Tauren gives you 2 more yards of AA range though. Helps with mags and other casters that slow 
---
As a vanilla human mage on Balnazzar-US:  
---
No, Mages are not useless in world pvp. As all classes, there exist some scissors, as you have enumerated, to the Mage's paper. However, Mages are not useless in any of those situations. Though, I will join you in lamenting fel-hunters. Don't forget, any PvP, World or Battleground, is a team based game. Play with people who fill in your weaknesses, regardless of what class you play. Learn to peel for each other and you will all have greater success.
---
Get t3 mixed with t0.5 and get talents put in to critical backstabs. You can stack up combo points pretty bloody fast and have pretty interesting energy returns. XD Besides that build I prefer swords.
---
Mages are one of, if not the best class for world PVP. They can be killed, and some classes are better against them than others, but they have incredible control, damage potential, oh-shit cooldowns and survivability, blink, etc. Yes, they're cloth so they're very vulnerable to melee damage, but PvP isn't about casters sitting still trying to cast while getting wailed on. 
---
 Calm down, i play horde
---
What are you going on about with this evidence? I’m not claiming that anything will happen, just that they can do whatever they want and do not have to keep the date of summer. 
---
where did they say that?
---
Calm down i play horde anyway
---
Yes it will be available. It will just take longer to load up without /sit crits.
---
I seem to remember dying in felwood one day and showing up in dark shore. 
---
I agree, but to have the biggest impact, move on. Stop playing their games, stop talking about their games on a subreddit dedicated to their games, stop buying their new games. Our wallets and time are the only thing that they truly here or care about.
---
This is definitely a do as I say not as I do moment for me.  I honestly just can't resist playing their games. I stopped playing wow, but still play D3 and SC2 on occasion.  I know I'll play classic.  I'll probably play WC3 reforged when it gets released.  Hopefully, I'll actually find games that will scratch the itch better than Blizzard games do. I want to be done with this company, as I truly feel they don't care anymore. I think classic will finally do it for me.  I'll play it, realize I don't like it as much as I used to like it, and move on from Blizzard for good. Diablo: Immortal just proves how little their fans actually mean to them.
---
Hi, /u/Synthex430
---
Oh right I didn't see that part.
---
I think he'll change his mind though. got a funny feeling ;)
---
Sounds like you should play hunter. Your dps won’t be bad enough to exclude you from a raid. And then into the later stages of classic, being a reliable raider often means more than just being “optimal.” Plus hunters are often needed for tranq shot.
---
The important bit is to play what you like because otherwise you won’t be having fun. Leveling is a big part of classic, and if you hate leveling a warrior then you might not even reach 60.
---
The biggest advantage rogues have in World PVP isn't their damage output or CC abilities, it's the ability to pick their battles. It's hard to kill a rogue one-on-one because usually, when you're fighting one, you're fighting on their terms. If their CDs aren't up, then they can just wait until they are, or slip away in stealth. They can wait to attack you until you're low on health or mana from fighting mobs, and if you catch them in the same situation, they can just vanish. If you're a really good rogue, then you'll never be in a situation where you're fighting at a disadvantage.
---
Currently playing Lineage 2 NA Classic servers and CRUSHING Apex. 
---
This is going a bit RP but I've always found the politics of the Alliance as pretty shitty.
---
fighting and murdering for the benefit of lords and kings? fuck that.
---
Thrall is an ex-slave. The tauren are at one with nature. The undead are trying to carve out their place in a world that doesn't accept them (and yeah maybe turn a few humans into zombies too, omelette = break eggs etc)
---
Ive heard that rolling hunter/mage as your first class is a great way to 1. have an easier first leveling experience while also 2. being able to funnel money from that first character (who can farm gold easily) into your warrior, as having a relevant weapon throughout the leveling process makes the leveling process wayyyy smoother. It will also give the servers enough time to acctually have weapon upgrades available in the AH so you dont have to rely on random drops and vendors.
---
Ive also heard warrior leveling can be super rewarding/engaing as you have hamstring kiting as your main way of efficiently killing mobs, so you'll constantly be on the move and forced to be creative. You can hop into dungeons literally at your leisure as tanks are always in demand and that'll switch up the pace if you get restless from grinding. Whirlwind axe is basically a sudo-class quest that you'll appreciate but wont able to solo until your mid 30's. Google macros as they will help save you lots of time/ make the class feel smoother. Use first aid + mining/blacksmithing to cut down time and to help you get some BiS gear later down.
---
That's my two cents yo, goodluck deciding!
---
indeed you are underestimating my abilities, friend 
---
Mages are incredibly mobile and can just keep moving and casting all day. You forget polymorph IMO. Blink, Ice Block, Nova, and escape artist if you’re gnome. 
---
Yeah warlocks and shadowpriests are a f***ing problem but they are to all classes...
---
Hunters are doable, you gotta get to their deadzone, nova and shattercombo his ass. If the pet is too pumped, wait it out in an ice block. Blink into the deadzone, pop mana shield plus mana gem and so on. 
---
Priests should be cleverly counterspelled on a heal, the bursted. You can lure out the heal by putting on presure, you need to be ready for it. Flash heal has 1 1/2 second cast time. Smart priests will fake cast the heal, wait for your reaction if u waster cs, and recast their heals. Then u have to sheep and escape. 
---
Best alliance handling spot? Stonetalon Peak. It's a 8min run from the graveyard for horde.
---
Same. Did it in stv trying to get the bb fp. 
---
People be crazy, mon.
---
If i were gonna play this.. And i have kept my account alive for the purpose then i am aiming for the same
---
Thanks for the laugh OP
---
Interested. What timezone are you using? 
---
Well, 12 come after 9, so you can only assume that they’ll make the game like it was in 1.12 (no shadow damage for Lupos)
---
You should buy Hollow Knight. It is easily the best $20 I’ve ever spent on a video game. So much bang for your buck and it is challenging and beautiful. DLC is free and another game is on the way. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ah1i1w/please_stop_recommending_lupos_every_time_hunters/
---
No, Lupos won't. Yes, BT will have 1.0 attack speed, along with the ZG bat and some others.
---
What is BT? Planning to roll a hunter but do not know what pets are the best yet.
---
We don't know yet sadly and we don't know if high level chests will require a higher level to unlock either.. we have to wait and see.
---
This is the exact reason why we need them to do a big Q&amp;A session.
---
It was more a joke as to what would be closest than any fine details.  Though you also didn't say this was for pre-level 60 either.  Though without context I assume this is for lockbox farming for your level 40 mount. 
---
Hunters are bottom tier dps throughout all of vanilla. This is why guilds only bring 2-3 hunters just for Tranq shot. 
---
Fury Warriors are top dps and nothing comes close. A guild can never have enough Fury Wars especially early on. Top guilds try to stack 15+ Fury Warriors. 
---
Pservers use 1.12 base as well, but allowed lupos to have shadow dmg until AQ released, that's the whole reason behind the post.
---
Im actually twinking a level 40 rogue but i have no main. 
---
Awesome, thank you kind internet stranger.
---
broken tooth
---
Hi, /u/HelpfulEditsYoutube
---
BT is Brokentooth. A rare spawn in the Badlands. It keeps a very low attack speed when tamed. Good for pvp.
---
Oh, I certainly hope it isn’t a 2500 pop cap, but what I saw at blizzcon, it’s going to be quite low. Also btw, server cap just means the amount of population on at one time, not the number of characters created. 
---
Also completely agree about merging lol, that’s pretty terrible and hope it doesn’t happen to any classic server. 
---
Character appeal/identity 5 vs 2, the answer is right there
---
Hunter is the best farming class IMO. I'll probably level one after I level a warrior for tanking just to farm stuff for my main. It'll probably never see the inside of a raid, and probably not see inside most dungeons. 
---
Granted, but you get voice cords of a Murloc. 
---
Solo warrior leveling is rough due to the amount of downtime while waiting for health to come back. Anything that reduces that downtime is going to have the largest effect on leveling. Your usual ways to combat downtime are eating food and using first aid bandages.
---
 * A level 35 Warrior has around 2500-3000 HP depending on spec and gear.
---
 * Level 35 food restores 1392 hp over 30 seconds. (out of combat only)
---
 * Heavy Silk Bandage restores 640 health over 8 seconds. (can use in combat)
---
**Cannibalize** will restore 35% of your HP over 10 seconds while out of combat. At 35 for Warrior this means about 750 hp over 10 seconds. It only works on humanoid and undead corpses, so it will be useless anywhere that you're only fighting beasts, demons, or elementals. Being able to use cannibalize every 2 minutes would be huge for a warrior, but you won't always be fighting humanoids.
---
**Regeneration** passively increases your health regeneration by 10% and also allows you to regenerate hp during combat at 10% of your normal rate. I don't know what all base regen numbers are, but back in the day the meme was that at level 60 the troll regen would add about 5hp per second (25hp per 5s) (while in combat and out). If we assume that it is half that at level 35 and a fight lasts 30 seconds then you would have regenned 75hp during the fight, and another 75hp while eating food for 30s.
---
**Conclusion:** On paper, looking at the raw numbers over the entire span of leveling, Regeneration is going to add up to more HP. It may not always be useful hp though, and it certainly won't feel impactful. Any scenario where you would have reached full hp without Regeneration should be considered like overheal and not counted toward any tangible benefit.
---
Granted, but you can't get more than 10 levels over the lowest level player of the opposite faction. 
---
Anyone else remember how long corpse runs were for dungeons in vanilla? Stratholme felt like you had to run across a quarter of EPL to get back to the live side entrance. Dire Maul, I remember taking forever and thinking, "boy, I should roll a nelf for wisp form." 
---
They said they are using 1.12 data. The data is what controls what type of DMG he does. So in this case, no shadow damage. 
---
I was replying to your comment about having huge lists of names. AKA you had it happen to you a lot, cuz you only pugged. Dunce.
---
Leaning heavily towards rogue. 
---
From reading alot of different threads warrior just doesn't fit my play style.
---
Most of RP takes place in people´s heads.
---
You don´t go out into the world and do actual content with group of other 4 people, there is DM (Dungeon Master) who makes the event for you, narrating it, RPing as enemies (often represented by raid marks) while you RP as characters, often using emotes to represent what your characters are doing. It´s about acting as a character and immersing yourself into the story and world of Azeroth...not video game World of Warcraft.
---
And now imagine that while you are doing this story for group of people who may be low level or wear sub-par armor (because there is no transmog, so you have to wear your RP gear) and some Horde players will gank you.
---
There is no story, no communication, no character development, just pressing your numbers, doing optimal rotation instead of what your character actually can do in the story and Horde saying something you can´t understand (if they even say anything at all).
---
For many, that´s not RP, rather, it´s something they want to avoid and normal RP servers offer this option.
---
It's an estimation to skill from 0-250 for gnomish battle chicken. But depending on market 0-300 should also only be below 100g,  because the last part is Thorium Widgets from 260-300 which you can sell for quite a good amount for the Dark Moon Fair neckpieces. 
---
Blizzard said reckoning will not be an available talent in Classic?
---
Would say mage but it also depends on what you want to do and what you like.
---
The Tauren racial would be worth about 125-150 HP at that range.  
---
It's not regen, but it is more than what the Troll gets during the fight.
---
This is the kind of advice I come here for. :-)
---
You can still get reckoning charges without a sit macro. 
---
Okay... then why say anything at all if you can't back it up. They obviously don't have to keep it but all their intentions points to it being a thing. And all the recent blizzard-activision releases have met their intended release marks. 
---
Such a bullshit class, prep never should of been a thing.
---
Broken tooth. It isn't actually the *best* pet like a lot of people say, he just has 1.0 attack speed (fastest in the game, and you can get BT at level 40, earlier than any other 1.0 AS pet). However, attack speed is not end all be all, with the exception of PvP. He's also a cat, so he can get both bite and claw, meaning he will never max focus.
---
So definitely good, but for leveling there are arguably much better pets (boar for charge+food, owl for AoE threat and damage debuff), and in PvE raids there are also better pets (any wolf for howl, windserpents for ranged damage and better positioning). BT is very over hyped, and is a serious pain to get. He's a rare spawn in the Badlands, and is usually pretty heavily contested by other hunters looking to get their pvp pet. It's worth noting that *technically* BT has an edge with faster attack speed meaning more crits, so more procs on frenzy if you are a BM hunter. But again, outside of PvP for spell pushback, you'll barely notice compared to a 1.2 attack speed tiger (which are very ubiquitous in the game).
---
I recommend ignoring BT, and just getting a leveling/solo focused pet up till 60. By then, you can just grab a ZG bat for attack speed/PvP.
---
&gt; You're misunderstanding the crux of his argument not the other way around. In MODERN WOW, players don't back cap,
---
I'm understanding it. I play modern WoW. There is still back capping. The current meta of IoC results in 30v30 brawls for Workshop (and they also cause lag right now). SSvTM being an exception doesn't mean it's not an officially supported gameplay mode that their current infrastructure/model is not supporting. And the brawl does indeed lag.
---
And he is not saying that Blizzard will accommodate Classic with any particular amount of resources, or discussing resources at all. It's not an issue of resources. It's an issue of how accurately and frequently the server tracks the client's position in the game world in the modern game vs the current game (think inline of the packet arguments we have here, that used to result in simultaneous CC). You can't necessarily solve that issue with more computing resources, it comes down to network speed.
---
 Classic could have better performance *because* it doesn't necessarily require that fidelity, all I'm really arguing against is the idea is that it's not as important in the current game. All these discussions over BGs, and future BGs, aren't even considering the new War Mode feature + the Incursions that deliberately put us all in close proximity of each other, often resulting in fights larger than 40v40. 
---
Reckoning was only forcefully stackable by abusing server latency and spamming /sit (or the X key). You'd make the server think you were sitting, force a crit, then be standing when you received it, making it count as a Reckoning stack.
---
We aren't getting 2004 servers so there's no reason to have that bug be in Classic.
---
Mages are the best all around DPS class in Vanilla because they are literally strong at everything. 1 v 1, outnumbered, are great at every single BG, most wanted 5 man dps, wanted in raids and stacking them has no drawbacks, an make their own food, tied for best gold farmer.
---
As far as the list you have. Mages destroy the most most common rogue PvP spec and respeccing will cost 100 gold a week in Vanilla to raid/pvp with one respec. People are not going to be switching all the time to a anti mage spec like on private servers with 5 gold respecs.
---
Mages split with locks. The stupid spec that excels in 1 v 1 (SL Locks)the most on locks is not raid viable, is boring to play and locks can get away with a single spec for pve/pvp and save 100 gold a week, which is why people usually play locks in the first place. SL Locks also have no burst so people don't like to use them in BG's much.
---
Mages destroy a hunter if they can blink into range. grenade and run into range and abuse the deadzone. Hunters destroy the mage if they open on them from max range. Mages can do things like slowfall down to hunters who are defending (they excel at that) to get in range in AB. In WSG indoors mages should always win. In the wide open the hunter should win. Both classes excel in AV and mages have lots of tricks there to with level 1 blizzard and LOS and Blizzard not having a facing requirement and fighting in towers and buildings.
---
Vanilla is not TBC and after where healers are unkilllable. Healers are actually balanced in vanilla and counterspell is deadly.
---
Rogue vs mage is one of the biggest skill match ups in the game. It's definitely not an autoloss.
---
Mage vs hunter is also a decent skill match up, it can be very hard for a mage though if the hunter catches you dismounted at far range. But oppositely if you are catch as a hunter by a mage in melee you are usually fucked.
---
Warlocks is rip
---
Priest is a skill match up. 
---
Mages are in no way the worst class at all. They aren't OP however, they have actual skill matchups in worldpvp instead of auto loss/win like a lot of other classes have(except against warriors :D) 
---
I'm looking forward to Classic having:
---
Population control
---
less bots
---
less gold seller whisper spam
---
My pets will have names instead of being named "Unknown" forever
---
pet pathing fixed
---
I'm sure there's more that I can't think of right now
---
Looks like almost everyone in this post hate old school AV :o
---
While I understand why PvP fans hate it, I personnally LOVED AV and played it a lot back in the day. I was more a PvE boy and a bit of open world PvP.
---
Yes the map contains a lot of PvE. But hey, there is people that enjoy mix of PvP and PvE. I was one of them.
---
If you dont like it, it doesn't necessary means it needs to be removed/changed.
---
Now I expect to be downvoted ! :p
---
And there is actually a fucking a spirit healer in Stonetalon Peak.
---
Then don't play xdddddd
---
Yeah you can just let an npc hit you until you get the stacks
---
This is why I never got into PVP videos back in vanilla. Everything was over-edited. PVP videos coming out of the private server scene are my own personal standard of excellence. They edit only where necessary, and allow you to see what is happening in the fight. Sometimes they even add notes in the video describing the small things they're doing in the fight that the layperson may not notice.  
---
The absolute number one cancer of PVP videos is slow zoom-editing. It's distracting more than anything else and is not "cool" by any stretch.  
---
Hope you guys like this vid - I was expecting Classic WoW's upcoming success to have an informing effect on the later development of retail, but I hadn't expected that it would start to happen even before Classic was released!! 
---
exploiting it will not be possible... but you can still stack reck and whomp a rogue do death.
---
yes, you are correct, that's my understanding of how it's worked on the pservers
---
or, you know, a rogue in wpvp (see OP) will rack up stacks quickly.
---
Also master of not getting killed in world PvP.
---
Same lol. Ran for like an hour. Forget where I was going. Tried using the spirit healer when I got there and got ported back. I was so mad. XD
---
I get this. I love pvp and everyone says you HAVE to be engineering but I love gethering too much so I won't be engineering. You gotta play the way you want not what everyone is saying is the best way. Vanilla was all about playing what you felt was cool, not what everyone was telling you was the best. If you hate orcs but will play one for the stun resist then i think that you are making yourself not have as much fun as you could. Just don't let other people say what you are going to do. Have fun.
---
fixed what? A ret pally talented into reckoning will get stacks of reckoning when crit by players in wpvp.
---
ZG will not be open on release, and yea BT is great for pvp, but a wolf is arguably better for the buff in pve.
---
Yeap same .
---
I thought I had figured out the ultimate traveling exploit. 
---
If you want a challenge in PVE play a prot warrior. Vanilla is not about only raiding and threat is all that matters. Healing really matters starting in about AQ. If you want a challenge there priest is probably the best option. The only dps spec with a challenging rotation is Hunter and possibly Rogue IF swing timer autoswing works with sword procs like it did in vanilla instead of TBC and later where it didn't matter. It's possible that won't even be a thing in vanilla, just like 2 handed fury isn't the go to PVE spec for warriors like it was in 1.1. Blizz might not consider it worth it since it's only like 5 percent dps or something.
---
Are they? Most off tanks were Fury Warriors that I remember
---
I thought they limited the Critical stacks so you couldn't one shot world bosses after duels.
---
Unless you're just choosing from those two, the best noob-friendly class is definitely paladin. Some people find the playstyle dull though.
---
Shaman is very cool tho. Leveled it to 33 on a private server two weeks ago and its really good. Ghost wolf is a blessing too.
---
But druids aren't alliance only :P
---
Imo, old AV is one of those things that is fun to experience a few times, but is an absolute chore to play after the initial magic is lost.
---
limited to 5.
---
But ret paladins still hit like a truck... and 5 stacks means that's hitting like 6 trucks. Plus procs from those 6 hits.
---
Nope. You can love Vanilla, but if you think loot trading is okay you are an idiot, in my opinion. I have my opinion, and no matter how many people would agree with me or the other person it's still my opinion and you have no right to it. In fact, stating it is my opinion, is meant to show that I have no interested in discussing it with others.
---
This seems like a post trying to make yourself look like "i pLaYEd iN VAnIlLA " but not only does that not matter at all, the meme makes no sense. Wtf is this subreddit. 
---
Since you like PVE more then PvP warrior or rogue. Warrior is more flexible and higher dps. With warrior you can form a group any time you want as a tank and you can easily tank anything but the main boss in raids as the dps spec.
---
The only time I would go rogue over warrior is if you just have no time to raid. Warriors are too gear dependent if you will never raid. If you do raid then it's no issue.
---
**Most** rare mobs in vanilla don't drop anything of amazing value. Just a green and in some cases a unique green but still not that amazing.  
---
Played a P-Server that the cave that Chief Winterfall, for Winterfall Firewater farming, was in was bugged. If you died In the cave it put your ghost in the Alterac Mountains graveyard. Needless to say, camping that cave was my favorite thing to do. 
---
Even in the modern game, you can only rez as the spirit healer you were initially placed it. It has been the same way since vanilla. 
---
They ran blades in the way back era of WoW but now the campaign and thought process is that with DevOps and the cloud, they can scale to the demand. 
---
Perhaps certain parts of the services are still in house but as for the actual game servers themselves? Those are definitely gonna be cloud based. I'd love to do an AMA with their current Infrastructure Org.
---
Right, but BGs and PvP rewards won't be open on release either, and will drop when ZG does. So IMO there isn't any reason to get a PvP pet till then, when/if you start the rank grind.
---
"we may not be the best dps"
---
endgame warlocks are the highest single non-meme target dps in game with adept stopcast usage
---
Really fun stream, the streamer dude is a pretty chill guy! Check it out everyone for a cozy, nice and relax chat about old school Warcraft.
---
gotta be some punishment for dying
---
the laughable repair bill isnt enough
---
Sorry sometimes I forget people don't play private servers , my point was discussing the reason mage aoe grinding became more popular than it was in vanilla.
---
Private servers had a tremendous influx of players and server populations bloated 3-4 times the original vanilla server load ,dynamic respawns was the band-aid fix for the problem ( though it created even more problems if anything ), and that accelerated respawn rate is what helped reshape the way some classes play in vanilla and what is generally favored.
---
It is not to say that mage are not good at aoe grinding, in fact they are great at it, but once you start doing the math for exp/hour generally in a non-overloaded server questing is slightly ahead of aoe grinding for mages except in some very specific level ranges/zones, but due to dynamic respawns you would lose more exp MOVING away from the spot you were aoe grinding since mobs respawned literally within seconds of dying, this means that it was much much more exp/hr for the mage to sit in that spot and just aoe grind over and over and then move to another zone to aoe grind again once those mobs became too low.
---
Since classic will have sharding it will not having dynamic respawns, as such aoe grinding will not be as favored as it is on private servers, which was the point of my post.
---
Sucks.  Don’t play them.  Leave that up to “others”.  
---
You have just proven that you never seriously raided. Hunters start of as top dps class in Tier one, still belong to top tier in BWL and start dropping off in AQ at Tier stage 2.5
---
So during 2/3 of content progression they belong to the top tier.
---
At nax they got the lowest dps of all pure dps classes, still far from bottom tier overall.
---
Smart lads are doing the same stuff on the same run.
---
Practically the first 6 months was a constant stream of disconnects, downtime, loot/npc lag, stuck in combat bugs and queues. People that had been playing the beta for months or with mmorpg experience charged forward to the higher levels and the masses slowly derped their way through the world in awe at the high levels with mounts or lvl 60s with epics.
---
But sit-critting is not a bug or an exploit. It is 100% intended for you to have 100% chance to be crit by melee attacks when you are sitting down. It was programmed that way.
---
Good god mages are so good in world PVP...
---
retardins are so bad, for them 5 autohits is equal to a bomb
---
Just in case it helps, I was on bronzebeard in vanilla on the horde side and I remember it being called VC since I remember being very very confused at first.   Now I could have heard it on a different server where I played an ally character, so I can’t be sure since it was a long time ago but I always remember VC.
---
This used to actually work as a teleport where you run all the way to a different GY, and then you have to log out and log back in to prevent the anti-cheat teleport from working.
---
However they fixed it on recent pservers so now it doesnt work.
---
Will be interesting to see what blizzlike is when classic drops.
---
Reminder: You'll have to go into Uldaman for enchants too....really despise that part. 
---
Well if ONLY dwarfes can be druids they are
---
Here's hoping!  I haven't played since the first month of Cata, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to see a comeback story for good ol' WoW.  Could be legendary.
---
Fair enough.
---
Just going to echo what everyone else here is saying, that Mages are one of the best.  If you're unable to kill a lock or priest, you can just polymorph, blink away, and ice block off the dots and completely avoid the fight.  You're far more mobile than any of your counter classes... except Druid.
---
Rogue vs Mage is a skill matchup.  You just need to practice if you consistently lose that fight.
---
I never said anything about dynamic respawns being in classic, you're misunderstanding what I wrote, read what I wrote a few posts above you for full info.
---
Other than being excited to play a new mmo after eq, i remember queue times, server crashes, and the loot bug. Where i was stuck in loot position after mining or looting something. It meant having to relog and often times rejoin the queue.
---
Why not try a new class? You’ve been there done that with a lock, why not shake it up?
---
Who said Blizzard was doing anything past Vanilla for Classic?  lol   they're not...#sorrynotsoorry
---
There is some truth in that and I'd be lying if I said I never experienced this kind of thoughts before, but you also have to realize that having a girlfriend and/or children doesn't automatically make happy forever.
---
It's just that we can't see the struggles of other peoples as clearly as we see our own. There are people who are married and have children and still feel regret because of it.
---
These very same people might look at YOU and might be thinking: "Oh, I wish I had the time to play classic WoW and feel like a child again etc."
---
The grass is always greener on the other side. And again, it's a natural thing to see all the good things other people have and not think about the kind of struggles they might be having that you don't.
---
A married person can feel regret for having a children or marrying, maybe because they realize they don't actually love their partner (anymore) and then beat themselves up because they feel bad for the child etc etc etc.
---
It's kind of an evil advice, but just check out various forums, websites or reddits and you'll see that being married and having children doesn't necessarily equate to having no regrets, being happy or living the life. In fact, marrying the wrong person and ending up having children can throw you into an even worse situation.
---
To piggyback on this: the role you wish to play in healing will also dictate your class choice. Priests and Pallies excel at single-target healing and are most often tapped to be MT healers. Shamans can do single target but really shine with multi-target heals; it's not uncommon for shammies to top the net effective heals charts (and certainly the gross heals charts) with the fat raid heals. Priests also posses a mana-inefficient but chunky AOE heal, and are also asked to multitarget and single target raid heal. As a druid, you are a true support class, and will pretty much never be on full-time MT healing duty. You will probably always be on the bottom of the charts numbers-wise, but your role is not to top the charts; you basically help all the other healers and the tank do their jobs better with your battle rez, innervate, roots, decurse, poison cleanse, dragon sleep, etc. abilities. That is not to say you are ineffective at healing in the least, but if you play druid don't expect your contribution to the raid to be quantifiable in numbers.
---
well if you're planning to use /sit macro with your horde warrior as fury, same result....#sorrynotsorry
---
As an adult with 2 kids and a fulltime job I just plan too play evenings after everything's done. I'll miss some days for sure with my kids playing sports. I also veg out on rainy nasty days and play more then I should. I've learned it's all about time management, my wife plays also but we have always taken time to spend with the kids and dont miss any of there games etc for a video game. I've been in a bit too deep with wrath and heroic progression. At that point I took a year off from the game. You just have too learn to balance your time.
---
I see what you mean, that was not my intention though, maybe what helped shape my reply was that due to OP missing crucial information to class actually causing misinformation due to that , I did not mean to be rude to him he did a great job trying to share things with people, I just think incomplete information can be misleading.
---
Yea buddy..  Find a server with a large faction imbalance.  Join low pop faction and make a rogue.
---
Targets everywhere and you don't feel bad at all killing them since you're the underdog :)
---
Rogue bro
---
&gt;That's why it eventually became an almost entirely PvP battleground. 
---
There is no PvP in AV since TBC. It's running past eachother on mounts and PVEing. Old vanilla AV had more PvP than any version after.
---
Yep, I think the only master enchanter is in there :/ 
---
&gt; even now on private servers warlock populations are nearly twice what they were in vanilla
---
But still the least-played class on the last few high-pop vanilla servers.
---
Then you are shit at articulating yourself. Thats fine I suppose.
---
Totally! More and better Wow can only be a good thing :) 
---
I wish that Blizzard would mix up loot-tables and droprates so stuff feels fresh when Classic lands
---
Yep. We never turned back a random who was roleplaying, even if we were in the middle of an event.
---
Unless he acted like a complete douchebag and/or metagamed (i.e: “/e stabs you.”).
---
Of course, RPing means some meetings are private and, since you can’t close doors, some people moved the chat to /p. This can cause confussion when a random shows up but it is not because of elitism. 
---
If you’re alliance and plotting the demise of Stormwind in a tavern you won’t exactly let Littlelegs the gnome hop in for a few laughs.
---
Yes. Usually by the end of the kidney shot, you have four stacks. Run over to clothie, target, unload. 
---
Granted.  But it's now with BC prepatch talents and abilities instead of 1.12, so bears and paladins are raid-viable tanks.  Nobody Alliance-side misses the warriors
---
enhance is not the worst pvp spec, probably middle of the field, however ele is the very top tier. people are smarter nowadays.
---
Did you happen to see any of the opening day action?
---
Have an upvote on this one.
---
But yeah he clearly stated that it might be subjective and is based on research.
---
Why doesn't the meme make sense?
---
imagine if it was world pvp.  half the people would just .... disappear .....
---
Different genres entirely though, here we are comparing different versions of the same game.
---
I think the census might be a bit misleading when it comes to warlocks, though.
---
I'm very sure that horde sports more warlocks than alliance because a  lot of people are paying too much attention to WotF and end up rolling something else instead, so I think 60-65% of warlocks on a server are probably on horde side, and given how, comparatively, warlocks are still way less popular it's safe to say that Alliance Warlocks will have an easy time finding a raid spot.
---
Then again, I'd be interested to see a really recent census. I've looked at several census data, but most of them from 1-2 years ago and not seperating between factions.
---
It is honestly of noone's concern what somebody does with their life except their own. It is up to them to play WoW one hour a week or sixteen hours a day, regardless of so-called 'social obligations' (whatever that means) and personal responsibilities. As long as you don't leech of others, be free.
---
Damn, that stinks...
---
Alliance can get a 10-charge [Bag of Marbles](https://www.wowhead.com/item=1191/bag-of-marbles). Utterly busted and the effect is classified as physical so it couldn't be resisted, meaning it worked on any enemy including raid bosses up until WotLK. The only drawback is that it's BoP so you could only get one per toon, but still.
---
Question for you since you look like you know what youre talking about lol. If youre leveling feral druid ,do you advise going all the way down the feral tree if you plan on doing dungeons to fill any roll, or should i go towards the feral/resto build that has swiftmend for those "Oh shit" moments? Whatcha think? If you have a talent progression idea thatd be awesome too. Idk if its worth going Furor immediately after Feline swiftness or just waiting until lvl 45 so that i can get wear Wolfshead helm at the same time for a huge damage spike
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Lag, too forever to get a mob tagged, loot bug getting stuck looting, server queues, server crashes. It was still awesome for me, I had a ton of free time so I could wait and play. The world blew me away. But the launch was rough.
---
Degenerate post
---
Oh man; remember when the downtimes were so often Blizzard gave you FREE DAYS because of it?
---
Why do people care so much about doing the most DPS when it doesn't benefit you on a personal level at all?
---
but vanilla aren't from beans, they're from flowers
---
Downvoted for thinking little of the biggest retbull and the leader of the Paladin Police Force.
---
 and fact that theyre not even good at 60 until they get geared seems like a huge hurdle that might put a poor taste in my mouth playing classic which i dont want to do early, so it seems warrior as a second class seems better. That really just leaves hunter which are nice since i like pets, their pve rotation is interesting, but the only thing is their dps scaling into endgame is so poor and i dont want to feel super weak as i gear up. 
---
&gt; I dont want to heal  
---
Warrior, ~~Paladin~~, Hunter, ~~Shaman, Druid~~, Rogue, ~~Priest~~, Warlock, Mage  
---
&gt; I mostly value engaging/fun pve rotation since thats mostly what ill be doing  
---
Warrior, ~~Paladin~~, Hunter, ~~Shaman, Druid~~, Rogue, ~~Priest, Warlock, Mage~~  
---
&gt; I dont want to do rogue since it just doesnt interest me as ive never liked stleath rogue type classes  
---
Warrior, ~~Paladin~~, Hunter, ~~Shaman, Druid, Rogue, Priest, Warlock, Mage~~  
---
&gt; i mainly want to do warrior but the awful leveling experience  
---
&gt; I guess im just looking for a justification to go warrior and just grit my teeth through leveling and early gearing, but i truly dont want it to cause me to quit playing early on with how bad it is.  
---
How much time will you be putting into Classic per week? Give me a calculated number based off of your schedule. The amount of time you will be playing will largely influence whether or not you feel like you're succeeding as a warrior. They require the most gold of any class to build their pre-BIS gear set, and are generally hard to get started. Players who play many hours per week are rewarded as warriors.  
---
&gt; That really just leaves hunter which are nice since i like pets, their pve rotation is interesting, but the only thing is their dps scaling into endgame is so poor and i dont want to feel super weak as i gear up.  
---
You won't actually be *super* weak while you're gearing up, but of course still below some other classes. The word "scaling" you used is very appropriate, because in late tiers they're practically invisible in the raid until you need a tranq shot or something kited. However, I will say that a very successful hunter in full T3 is still a spectacle to see. Hunters also have a very high skill cap in PVP, and seeing a masterful hunter PVP is a very cool thing to watch.  
---
If not seeing yourself at the top of the meters will absolutely break you, then maybe hunter isn't a good fit.  
---
Many questions left to be answered.  
---
**Summary:**  
---
PVE DPS tryhard and must be #1 on dps meters?  
---
Do you want to tank?  
---
How much time do you have to play each week?  
---
Can you do something that's disheartening if you know great reward lies in the future?  
---
Are you able to farm an ungodly amount of gold on a crappy warrior?  
---
No, in vanilla you could ghost run.
---
This way changed later. I know for a fact this is true since I would run my ghost ass through stv.
---
Thats the worst one!!
---
something technical 
---
I don't remember any connection issues or much congestion.
---
I played Illidan US within the first hour or so.
---
One important thing to know is there was no digital download.
---
You had to go to the store for a midnight release, and bring your copy home, install it, then log on.   Even if you were able to get a copy from midnight release, think about how many people got stuck trying to install the game.  Some of you young bucks who never had to deal with installation discs don't know the struggle.
---
For reference:
---
On retail release I didn't have to wait on Grik'nir the Cold, the named mob needed for a kill quest in the Gnome/Dwarf starting area.   You kill him around level 4.   On PS trying to get kill credit is usually a cock block.
---
I was down in the Yeti cave around level 7 after the first hour.
---
Even by today's standards that's decent speed.
---
If I had to guess, it was a combination of a few things:
---
1)  Obviously the amount of people who went to a midnight release to get a copy and get home, install, and not have any problems meant that there wasn't a zerg of people right away when the servers went up.  They trickled in over time.
---
2)  Most people were probably rolling Night Elf or Human, so the gnome/dwarf area had less people.
---
3)  For most people Nilla was their first MMO.  A fair share of people playing day 1 probably had experience on the beta, or EQ/Daoc/AC/etc, but a lot of them were probably derping around the starting zone just trying to figure out how to move their character around and how to cast spells or swing their weapon, let alone trying to do quests at a decent pace.
---
i rolled a tauren warrior just beacuse of this video back in the day!! 
---
yeah hes buffed to death and has pocket healers but when this video came out it was LITT!!
---
&gt; The paid casual subs they gained from these additions FAR exceeds the free sub count to this sub.
---
maybe because most of the redditers, like me, have noticed that the "subscribe" feature is garbage, and don't even care about it anymore.
---
&gt; Yes, these additions caused me to stop playing because being the "best" didn't mean as much anymore, but I can't fault them for making billions of additional revenue because of that decision.
---
that's exactly what I'm saying
---
&gt; Stop posting bad faith shit that you have absolutely no basis for in hopes of getting the circle jerk upvote.
---
seems like you're paid by both Activision and some mental patient
---
You keep referencing BFA players as being upset that they now have to "experience the world and play the game" with the removal of portals.  Now after reading all of the comments on the Official Forums players are upset about thing like...
---
It now takes me 10 minutes per character, each way, to reach the location where the daily quests are and I have 10+ characters so now it's not worth doing dailies because of the time investment so I'm angry.
---
It's hard to even draw parallels to repeating daily quests across a dozen characters as "playing."  To me, it's so far from gameplay that I couldn't even suggest a solution for them.  Just make daily rewards a log in bonus so no one has to bother.  I don't think the removal of portals is even a root problem.  Anyone could pay a mage for a portal but interacting with other players is an inconvenience and no one wants to forced into the world anyway.
---
I feel sorry for these players.  There's literally nothing Blizzard can do for them.
---
I wish Humans could be Shamans
---
You had to stay at the installer too, because it was like 6cds. Way faster than downloading at the time though lol
---
Reminder: Enchanting is a pain in the ass. Thank you.  
---
&gt;It's funny people still think rogues are these unstoppable pvp machines.
---
People who think that are usually the ones who have never played rogue. They probably got stunlocked or one shotted in wpvp by rogue and they think it's so OP. What they don't realize is how much preparation it requires.
---
&gt;I'm willing to bet that's a one in a million person.
---
yes. The remaining nine hundred ninety nine thousands nine hundred ninety nine RPers, are hentai actors (aka "ERP")
---
It's abuse when it's true you moron.
---
Enchanting: You think you do, but you don't.
---
Atleast Druids have the best T3 set
---
I think theres some new wow players that enjoy current wow, i dislike it and dont play it. If you dont mind waiting i think youll have a much better experience in classic wow. Leveling in current wow is pretty painful and not very fun. For example in current wow if you play a druid and get level 10 which takes like an hour you get cat form but in classic you have to get to 20 which makes a much longer time and feels soo much more rewarding especially when u see other druids using it, classic wow is magical current wow is... boring to say the least. 
---
Arthas had an amazing server community. We had so many battle ground feuds and even the world PvP nights.
---
I know it's cool to bitch about Pat running around with healer and buffs and what not, but Pat was one of the nicest guys I ever played with.
---
Wow... I hadn't even considered that people would do that... 10 characters worth of daily quests?! What madness! 
---
I wouldn't ever recommend rogue as noob friendly class. 
---
What do you have against Uldaman.
---
Dude this is great.  
---
I'm definitely going to use this exact template. It covers all the angles for ranks, talents, and each spell.  
---
It also looks pretty AF.  
---
Ah yes i too remember farming felcloth in felwood.
---
Well he has CS and KS and he knows that lock doesnt use a trinket. 
---
But yea still absolute
---
Hunters start of as lowest dps in MC together with Warlocks. You are utterly clueless. 
---
I don't know why a warrior in a guild with a ton of healers who also love PvP would ever go and PvP without one.
---
&gt;Unless he acted like a complete douchebag and/or metagamed (i.e: “/e stabs you.”).
---
I generally don't act like this. I mean, when it becomes obvious that they're ignoring the environment, I usually make some in-character "poke" movements to break their fake-IC environment - for example, at first I make some emotes, like failed sneaking, or "/y hey, why is nobody extinguishing!", something that obviously suggests that they should pay some attention to me. And if they don't, well, they're OOC, so I pop piccolo :Ð
---
And, half of ArgentDawn's non-hentai RP guilds act like this. For some reason, they do all the /e and /say ingame, but they do some dice rolls and other stuff on discord, and ignore the rest of the server.
---
Didn't happen in STV that often for me...Tanaris though...
---
Alterac and the Pirate Cove in Tanaris are the top offenders for this, it's brutal to die fighting the Syndicate by the northern coast and your graveyard is in Southshore...
---
I rolled a male orc rogue in Vanilla for kicks because they're huge and have an awesome stealth animation. 
---
&gt;Clearly you didn’t play vanilla. It’s part of the struggle. Accept it.
---
Dungeon Finder? Or sharding?
---
3-rd part of BuffCapped Vanilla series.
---
Many of you guys was asking for ret pala... Well I'm pretty shocked with result (nevermind there is enough fails like using Rank1 consecration).
---
Enjoy!
---
P.S. Cmon, bubble boys!
---
As long as it has good stats, I'll wear it.
---
Best content all day, thank you for sharing.  Really well organized.
---
well enjoy your downvotes
---
I mean, WoD wasn't that long ago and since then we've actually lost even more abilities, tmogs where thing back in the WoD and azerite, that piece of shit is usually just passive effect on most of my characters and by the way some of those effects are abilities removed since WoD. 
---
Trashran was running just fine, so why it's so bad in BfA? It's actually ridiculous and there's no excuse for that, especially with how they were hyping up warmode.
---
Human Hunters aren't in Classic. That was a Cataclysm race/class combo.
---

Granted, but players 10 levels lower than you can attack you.
---
You must be single, haha.
---
What the other commenter said about horde/alliance ratio is true. [If you look at a certain private servers class stats](https://lightshope.org/stats) you see that locks are more popular than priests, and more popular than druids by a large margin.
---
I can see many people played Classic WOW when they where kids and now have grown up with familys jobs etc etc. But im a little different i was past 30 allready when i played Vanilla WOW. I allready had a family job etc. I spent alot of time playing WOW 3 to 6 days per week, but i also looked after my kids, went to work and spent some time with the wife. 
---
Now in 2019 im divorced "NOT DUE TO WOW LOL"I see my kids every few weeks and i am looking froward to playing Classic WOW. 
---
If i can play WOW for hours per day, goto work, spent time with the kids and wife back in the day. Im sure most of people will not find it hard to spent some time playing wow as well as doing other real life stuff its not hard. They only problem is how many hours of sleep you get :)
---
yeah! i post them and edit. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgw2mtThvKtdvUKpeSIn87A?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgw2mtThvKtdvUKpeSIn87A?view_as=subscriber)

You always want a hunter to have TSA but not every hunter needs it. So if you have enough with TSA the others could go survival for increased dps

"his paladin build is completely dependant on the pummeler and will have a much harder time farming it since he can't stealth past mobs."

---
sure this video is from TBC but for christ sake a Paladin not being able to solo a few mobs in Gnomer should delete their toon right now...
---
Bubble hearth would like to have a word
---
was mostly a joke, but good point.
---
IT WAS AMAZ ***You have been disconnected from the server.***
---
Respect at 60? Why not tank a bit and get the gear you need first before switching over. Faster groups as a tank in most cases. 
---
Transmog before it was mainstream! You could say I was a pioneer!
---
Listen to the countdown to classic about talondril or whatever his name was go into detail about why. One of the main reasons I recall from it is that they can swap to cat form in the instance they aren't needed during a fight and do more dmg than an off tank warrior would. But he goes into the numbers for mitigation as well.
---
Yeah lol, I remember getting into it as an innocent. No idea what I was doing. Maybe 30 days /played to 60
---
But I wasn’t day one.
---
Brutallus is notable since how most raids handled Meteor Slash was to just hope the tank dodges it, and it helped a lot. Then Blizz nerfed dodge tanking by adding the Sunwell debuff and making Meteor Slash a guaranteed hit.
---
What addon was used to swap trinkets so easily
---
MMO's weren't designed for people who could play 2 hours per day, and shouldn't be.
---
It's very easy to think you're a good mage, harder to actually be a good mage. Because of this a lot of people think it's a weakness with the class rather than the player. With two high skilled players 1v1 there is no class that can auto-win vs mage with probably the felhunter as an exception. 
---
Greetings, Tim the Enchanter!
---
Didn't know about that one, good find!  
---
Another one like that is Light of Elune\*
---
 \*Use: [Grants immunity from all damage and spells for 10 sec.](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=6724) (cooldown 2 min)   
---
Also BoP and not farmable.  
---
I was primarily interested in farmable items/weapons though.
---
thanks a lot for the kind words :-)
---
True, I explored half of the world at lvl &lt;10 like this lol
---
really appreciate your compliment!
---
Dont get Feral aggression. You dont pick up Ferocious bit til higher levels and you spend very little time in bear form using demo roar. Try more like this  
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhzZxMTscbdtV
---
Even in vanilla most raids only ran three. My understanding on pservers is that has been cut to two or even one. Certainly in Naxx, which is when you hit the gear level where the spec is viable, you aren't running more than two. So there is no "Other Hunter" to pick it up. 
---
not planing to respec to resto, will stay tank as long as possible :-)
---
Yup. Did that.
---
You know, I never ended up playing Night Elf Hunter.
---
because its the only way i can validate myself irl and my ego is fragile
---
I take it you play on PvE realms?
---
Do you not think OoC is worthwhile?
---
The real question is why you are defending someone well known for pulling shady shit repeatedly.
---
Fair point. Was going to advocate to at least rank for bis pre raid. That or tank raids as a bear. Because why not 
---
It's the servers. However, BfA servers are probably configured with sharding in mind where 40v40 probably isn't expected behavior, the classic servers could be configured in an entirely different way with only one big shard in mind with a higher resource allocation cap.
---
[Large Rope Nets](https://classicdb.ch/?item=835), [Magic Dust](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2091), and if you're twinking, [Magic Candles](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2091) are all useful, farmable items.
---
You forgot to mention the high trolling potential of Priests thanks to MC (+1 if Nelf priest that can use Shadowmeld to surprise MC players about to get on a, say, Thousand Needles elevator). 
---
Have to assume that was a misclick...
---
I have complete respect for people who are open to improvement and want to get to know the game, but let's be honest - there WILL be people who aren't necessarily into the idea of vanilla wow but are going to play it for a couple days anyway because they have the mutual sub.
---
Vanilla WoW, despite being a not so hardcore game is a test of patience and endurance. Some people will quit at level 5, some at 10, some at 20. If they make it past that, they're likely to stay. Just a side note.
---
No one can tell you what it was like, because no one could log in!
---
I kid but I got three free days of game time at release just because I literally couldn't play the game. Average MS of 5000-9000 (bear in mind I was physically a two hour drive from my server's location and unlike a lot of people I had high speed internet). I'd take two steps and disconnect, it'd take seconds to minutes to resolve a quest box or interact with an object. Some say there are still release characters picking up water at the well to this day, from people who disconnect and never came back. Also sometimes you'd get stuck looting and you just had to relog to fix it, which of course was a nightmare because logging back in took forever. 
---
The people who got on first and/or got lucky with connection (and there were a few) ended up super far ahead of everyone else. Literally 2-3 days ahead, because they could play and everyone else couldn't. 
---
Can not watch the video because of the music, but a question I had from your previous videos is what buffs/debuffs you are using when you are running your dps tests? Some classes scale much harder with certain things like windfury than others and not taking that into account seems like a mistake.
---
Omen of Clarity is too good to skip. He either misclicked the talent point in the build or have no idea what you should spec. Most likely the latter since he went Thick Hide over Feral Instincts (More threat in bear form + better stealth. Complete key talent if the intention is to tank and it also makes stealthing around mobs and players much easier)
---
I sure hope so..? OoC is a DPS increase.
---
yep, totally useless  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v\_OoUNtunIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_OoUNtunIw)
---
Oh God my internet points, whatever shall I do 
---
guess so too, Natures Reach does not make too much sense here
---
I am worried about the hardcore private server players that have been playing vanilla for 10 years and know the ins and outs of the game .
---
I didn't start playing until burning crusade so as far as raid mechanics and fights go i am clueless. I just hope the mentality of most players isn't go go go, lets clear this raid as fast as possible, if you fuck up your kicked.
---
From what i have seen they come off as very opinionated and snarky. 
---
I really hope there are actual progression guilds and its not about how fast we can clear this raid. 
---
Granted
---
You now get all BiS gear from level 1 mobs and you get gray trash gear only from raids
---
Minor thing I'm just wondering, isn't Insect Swarm a Restoration Spell? I mean I understand why you put it in Balance cause it's a DoT and on later expansion it even changes to Balance tree, but in vanilla you can find the talent to learn the spell in the Resto tree. 
---
My question is, when you learn it, where do you find it in your spellbook? Maybe you do find it in Balance spellbook tab but it'd make more senes to me if it was in Resto tab. 
---
If it does apear in balance tab I'm wondering if there's any other spell that tou learn in one tree but belongs to another spec. 
---
100% off topic I know, but now to the actual spreadsheet.
---
-----
---
Its totally up to you but while leveling I feel like reducing stealth detection would be really beneficial, and having extra threat could make it easier if you ever want tank any dungeons. And I read (didn't actually do the math on it but I trust tryhards who do) that feracious bite isn't much of your dps, so a 15% increase to that isn't worth the 5 points. Therefore I would change 5/5 Feral Agression to 5/5 Feral Instinct. 
---
uhm no? its literally the opposite. up to bwl your best bet is to go deep resto, spamming reju and saving with swiftmend. but once you have some of that bwl gear and have a decent amount of spellcrit going balance for nature's grace has proven to be the better choice.
---
Well there is pretty big list, I thought most vanilla funs knows the icons...
---
Buffs can differ cause of class choosed for test, but in general its more like:

probably pvp-realm, depends a bit if I can find a some old friends to play with me and on what server they want to play
---
Orellian - Disbelivers of Faith. Good times!
---
You can still simply get crit on. It’s not exactly uncommon. 
---
&gt;PVE DPS tryhard and must be #1 on dps meters?
---
Not necessarily. Mostly just want to feel as though I'm playing an important role and not there just to fill out the group/raid.
---
&gt;Do you want to tank?
---
Not as a main. I wouldn't mind tanking to change things up though every now and then and/or to fill the role if needed.
---
&gt;How much time do you have to play each week?
---
Ill have a new job which has a decent commute, so ill only play a couple hours a day. 10 - 30 hrs a week.
---
&gt;Can you do something that's disheartening if you know great reward lies in the future?
---
Yes, but I'd likely have a limit on how disheartening it can be before I'd lose interest.
---
&gt;Are you able to farm an ungodly amount of gold on a crappy warrior?
---
Probably not if its incredibly slow to farm gold on a warrior. It does seems after answering these questions that it would probably be the best choice to go hunter as my first character, and then role a warrior down the line once I've gotten some gold and gear.
---
That is exactly my spec actually, lol!
---
To me, it depends on how the question is asked.  If someone asks a question humbly, I'm fine.  When someone acts like they're entitled to some feature that's no longer there, I treat them like a spoiled brat.

Force Reactive Disk doesn't break nearly as fast as you say. I think you have never actually used the shield if you think it breaks  "every few pulls". I can run 2-3 strat live before it breaks. (With all the big multi skele pulls). 2-3 in your bags is nice, but not necessary. 5 force reactive disks is ridiculous.  
---
You didn't even mention battle shout aggro. 
---
And if there was no queue you had the "a character with that name already exists" so you then had to relog and wait until your character get kicked out of the game.
---
Warlocks were hit with the nerf bat many times.  Mainly fear.  I had no problems fear kiting the shit out of anything.  Deep affliction was bad ass, until everyone realized that you could cleanse/dispell 99% of a warlocks abilities.  Then to top it off, they nerfed the shit out of fear.  
---
thx for the support! yeah it was a fine stream tonight. im really exited for wc2 campaign
---
Or you are shit at reading. I mentioned ret multiple times, I was responding to a guy who was talking about ret. If I were talking about feral druids, the paragraph that you quoted:
---
&gt;Here's the big one - if a feral druid doesn't spam pummelers all the time, his DPS doesn't go completely down the shitter thanks to powershifted shred. However, your character gets almost all his DPS boosted by haste. This means that if you take away your pummeler, you're doing roughly 40% less DPS.
---
would literally mean that without pummelers, a feral druid's DPS simultaneously doesn't go down the shitter thanks to powershifted shred (a dominant instant ability that doesn't scale with haste) and does go down the shitter because feral gets almost all of its DPS boosted by haste. 
---
Seriously, just read before you post.
---
Ha.  Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
---
Blink, frost armor, ice block, polymorph, some of the best snares in the game and a lot of instant-cast damage (cone of cold, fire blast, arcane explosion).  If you interrupt their arcane they have frost attacks, if you interrupt frost they can still blink/interrupt/deal damage.
---
Finder. The meeting stones plus a  warlock and your golden. 
---
There are multiple ways to deal with this. Basically you just do a massive pull, get them all intiially attacking you with demo shout/battle shout, or even a sapper charge (Kinda overkill for stockades). Then you have reflection gear ( gear that has thorns type effects) to build aggro on the group as they attack you. You can also pop a aoe damage trinket like Ramstein's lightning bolts.  For pulls of 3 or 4 mobs, you can use whirlwind after charge if you like. If you happen to be arms, you can charge, sweeping strikes, whirlwind with a 2 hander to get a ton of early aggro.   
---
If you are running someone through stockades, the reflect damage will be enough to get the mobs to stick to you.   
---
Also, Force Reactive Disk and Thunderfury are great. 
---
I don't think the changes made it an "almost entirely PvP background," regardless of what might have been intended. Instead, the focus shifted even more to PvE, and the 'battleground' became a glorified boss race: each faction avoided the other when possible in a mad dash to knock out the other team's end boss. Small skirmishes happen along the way occasionally as minor delaying strategies, with aspirations not of a larger fight but of delaying the other faction a little bit on their way to the boss so that your own team has more DPS uptime on the boss.  
---
Even if AV wasn't popular because of the PvE elements, as this fellow claims, making it even more focused on PvE seems like a strange response. When it was first released, the PvE elements inspired/required massive, long bouts of PvP. Today, they have been reduced in their challenge level to supposedly satisfy people who didn't want PvE, only to let people skip all the PvP and go fight a really, really easy boss.
---
i just don't get it. they want to immerse with the story and azeroth? well there is a war going on in azeroth between the factions. not fighting them is such an immersion breaker.
---
People like that will always be around. You just need to find a guild that’s good for you since the alternative will always be there as well: casual guilds who raid once/twice a week and don’t push too hard.
---
And also vanilla will be a massive social endevour; i doubt you will ever find a guild in which you like everybody. But as long as the leaders are cool and you find your own small hub of friends to screw around with, you should be fine.
---
Deathmaw is the best pet for raiding. Rare wolf in Burning Steppes w/ 1.2 attack speed and the furious howl buff for your melee. FH is usually required in any serious raiding guild.
---
If you combined every RP'er across every realm and region and put them on one server, it wouldn't have been enough for them. They didn't want to put in the effort to foster a community. They just wanted one spoon-fed to them.
---
There was a very active community on Maelstrom. We had huge storylines and weekly events -- but the people that complained never showed up. They wanted their own little world to be lush. They didn't care about the experience outside of that.
---
That is also true
---
I was wondering about the Insect Swarm as well, but the DataBase I used listed it as a Balance spell, so I sticked to that
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?spells=7.11.574](https://classicdb.ch/?spells=7.11.574)
---
Thanks for your thoughts about  Ferocious Bite /  Feral Agression - will consider that.
---
There is no war going on between the factions. Read the lore, they are actually in peace, with certain sub-factions fighting.
---
Thanks for the responses guys, I get it now... I'm sorry to hear that.
---
Yep. This is accurate. Many RP'ers will also immediately disregard people that raid/PvP in addition to RP'ing, as they feel that they wreck their immersion.
---
&gt;Get t3
---
Yeah man, when 2021 rolls around in time for Naxx, just casually *get* T3 and steamroll people, nbd.
---
corpse running from dwarf starting zone to human to try to res was a mistake.
---
Me too, send me a pm with your steam :) 
---
I think there will be plenty of guilds where you can get (not just) close to raiding even in the super-casual schedule. I know I want to join/create one. Not having a kid yet (congrats to you!) but in a similar boat with very limited time, looking to raiding maybe once a week/2 weeks. I think there's plenty of us!
---
I think Classic will be a phenomenon in this way. A lot of veteran players coming back to play, whole different generation than typical gaming demographic. And there will be a lot of chances to make friends again. Friends with kids also, or married couples, or similar. We're older, yeah, but there will be a lot of us, reminiscing the old days and I think it will be glorious.
---
See you in Classic!

---
Well, mongoose bite doesn't change this =(
---
Thats pretty weak spell. Hunters as melee are really lacks instant abil like Bloodthrist
---
Yep there you go alliance replace half your warriors and rogues with rets.
---
&gt;Finder. 
---
the Mac OS file manager?
---
&gt; The meeting stones plus a warlock and your golden. 
---
what is the point? You have no choice over who you match with, through the meeting stones. And, in order to invite that warlock, you'd need to convert your party to raid, which is irreversible, so you'd have to disband it and create anew. Half of the party wouldn't understand that complicated manevour anyway.
---
&gt; Not necessarily. Mostly just want to feel as though I'm playing an important role and not there just to fill out the group/raid.  
---
I can tell you that if a guild gets a hunter that they never have to worry about again, because they know he's skilled enough to perform his job perfectly every time, then they're going to be very happy about that.  
---
&gt; Not as a main. I wouldn't mind tanking to change things up though every now and then and/or to fill the role if needed.  
---
Your sentiments about tanking pretty much land you in a DPS role then, since you will be off tanking from time to time even as a main spec dps.  
---
&gt; Ill have a new job which has a decent commute, so ill only play a couple hours a day. 10 - 30 hrs a week.  
---
If your time is more on the upper end of that scale, you could succeed as a warrior. If you feel as though it's not reliable, playing hunter might be a safer bet.  
---
&gt; Yes, but I'd likely have a limit on how disheartening it can be before I'd lose interest.  
---
This here pretty much finalizes my ideas that you're better off playing a hunter. Don't be upset about this, hunters are a very self sufficient. They excel in a lot of areas in the game that make the overall experience very stress free. The final prize of top DPS is ultimately not yours, but your life is pretty relaxed playing a hunter, and again the skill cap on a hunter is very big. There is room to grow your skill set with this class.  
---
&gt; Probably not if its incredibly slow to farm gold on a warrior. It does seems after answering these questions that it would probably be the best choice to go hunter as my first character, and then role a warrior down the line once I've gotten some gold and gear.  
---
Not incredibly slow, but there's surely a lot to farm. And of course, you and I arrive at the same conclusion.  
---
As a silver lining to this entire thing, you'll be happy to know that your hunter's farming abilities are rivaled only by a mage in single play, and that your ability to produce gold will be a huge boon to your warrior's leveling experience and pre-raid gearing experience.  
---
I think your setup is looking great, and you'll have a great time in Classic.  
---
Get someone else to level with, like a warrior which means you already got a dungeon group ready if you want.
---
Almost a guarantee there will be sharding unfortunately. Blizzards server stability since BFA launch has been horrible and lags/crashes during 40v40 world pvp fights. 
---
With that being said at least it wont be permanent.
---
Mass amounts of crowd pummelers are needed. As is ranked pvp gear. But if you have those things, and know how to powershift, druids are monsters of off-tanking. Druids have literally the best threat-per-second, and have higher HP values. Problem is they arent immune to crushing blows, and don't have quite the same dmg mitigation via armor values on gear. I think realistically every raid should be running with a prot warrior as their MT, a bear druid as the main OT, and a fury/prot hybrid warrior as the 3rd OT. 
---
OP said he's not going resto but if it was the case i would still respect at 60. Yes finding groups is easier as a tank  but the healer will have priority on the healing gear so in the end you'll get way less gear.
---
Ohh alright, yeah I'd trust classicdb, its been pretty reliable. 
---
Btw I'm doing a really similar spec but I'm debating that maybe after Feral Charge I'd go up to Omen of Clarity on Balance tree and maybe even Natural Shapeshifter before going deep into feral.  Even though it will obviously decrease my dps, I feel like it'd open up my possibilities all around emphasizing on the hybrid aspect of the druid.
---
This is why I use the Big Bag of Enchantment. 
---
Or just keep Arcanite and Truesilver rods. Chances are you wont ever need to do the low level enchants anyway.
---
Ouch.  
---
&gt; "But with today's technology it shouldn't be too difficult to get so many people into the game at once."
---
Today's technology IS sharding. The alternative is what we actually had in Vanilla launch, which was many hours of servers dying and huge login queues.
---
Sharding is going to be necessary on launch day because without it the servers will die a death. It's not really about questing contention, it's about literally being able to play at all. They know we don't want sharding and they wouldn't introduce it for any reason other than server stability.
---
Paladins are notoriously super boring to level.
---
 Suramar was my first server, but I only had Alliance toons on there so we may not have really crossed paths. I was Jinju (dwarf warrior) and Vinju (dwarf priest) through the start of TBC.
---
Tell me, how can you experience launch where people gradually come into the game over long span of time instead of all of them rushing in at midnight of release day?
---
You literally cannot experience Vanilla launch day, because this is not 2004/2005.
---
Also the only enchant recipes that make money drop in raids and will go to your guild enchanter, which probably won't be you, so you may never recover the cost of leveling enchanting to 300. You would have done as well to never level it and use it to DE stuff to sell the shards.
---
You're only in it to disenchant loot, you don't need a rod.  Let the one fat kid who spams /y 24/7 from the IF bridge or Org bank deal with the actual enchanting.
---
Awesome, I definitely feel better about going hunter now. Thanks for all the explanation and info!
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=5206](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5206) if you are super tryhard as a Dagger rogue.  Might possibly work for Feral druids as well. Only way to get them is to loot them from some mobs that spawn every time a Nightelf does a quest at level 7-9ish.
---
tauren stomp is actually really useful, as an offensive play when you don't even have rage to fill that cast bar so may as well use it, which would block an attack or 2, or more if aoe, or as a defensive play so you can stun multiple enemies and not risk getting dazed if you fuck up the strafe fleeing and die.
---
For sure, and there will also be snobs that scoff at the presence of a tank that can't hold aggro well or something. There is always a difference of person and their qualities but some people will just not know that greeding for greens is a thing or that rolling for chests is common courtesy *(usually)*. 
---
Just wanted to throw it out there that the game will attract differences of people and occasionally giving tips rather than berating. 
---
Those people will fizzle out soon when it becomes clear the game isn't for them, and thats fine but one of the great things about vanilla is the community, and its usefulness. I'd hate to see it get away from the playerbase because newbloods are standing where they stood a decade ago.
---
ICC fucked up the most important part of school for me (not that I'm not to blame). 
---
The game at that point was harder to kick than my 10 year smoking habit. I'm kind of grateful that Blizzard ruined it and I was able to finally get on with life. 
---
Druid / Hunter would be very fast and make up for each other's weaknesses (druids can't pull multiple targets w/ range without high Mana usage, they lack CC for same reasons, and hunters lack healing and "panic" cc like bash or nature's grasp - though they do have feign death). Each also has fast movement, high dps and survivability 
---
The retail and private server communities are much more alike than they think TBH. Played on both and many of the people on private servers are just like retail players in that they go go go for dungeons!! The only difference is AoE is usually not an option, and it takes longer but the mindset is very similar for something such as dungeons.
---
Any class wielding a two hander would consider 5 consecutive auto hits one hell of a bomb. Keep in mind this is classic. Most of your damage is white hits. Getting 5 out in under a second is equivalent to getting off 15 seconds worth of auto attacks. It's really OP when you pull it off. That being said. Horde for life.
---
I think part of the difficulty of naxx was the atrocious fps dips, and I also think there will be far less inexperienced level 60s when compared to retail back in the day. I am fairly optimistic we will be casually clearing Naxx. One can be hopeful. XD
---
Nost managed it with almost no money and 12k people on a single server though...
---
OCD or ADD?
---
Paladins have very few buttons.  Maybe a Priest or a Warrior would be more what you're looking for if you lose interest in the Paladin.
---
Ele shaman next pls
---
Theres some limited cooking reciped over at the docks of ratchet if you end up there during your travels 
---
Why would you link a naxx geared player pvping
---
I’m not and haven’t been for quite a while actually. But did it feel good typing that?
---
That's one we are definitely considering!
---
How is no one linking vurtne?
---
A paladin as a DPS? 
---
Interesting. Yeah, my experience is purely anecdotal, but I can only think of one time during my Vanilla/Pserver experience that we had a Druid do any tanking, off or otherwise. Perhaps it’s also because most druids in my raid were resto to begin with.
---
Im sure this is unpopular but Sharding the first week or two and only in starting zones i.e. elywnn/durotar maybe also westfall/barrens seems reasonable.
---
I would want to actually play the game at release and not sit in a server queue or not have anything there to kill jist because I showed up an hour after launch.
---
I think people take the no changes too far sometimes, this, and agin if only for an exremely short time, seems like a reasonable decision.
---
They shouldn't be designed around a 2 hour time limit specifically, no. I completely agree with you. But from not only a business standpoint but from a game play standpoint no game will succeed if only hardcore players can play. Some people might look down on the so-called "casuals" but the people that are going to be most attracted to Classic WoW are the people who played it heavily when it released IMO. Sure there are going to be people who just want to experience Vanilla that didn't play then, but for the most part everyone I've spoken to personally that want to play Classic played in Vanilla. This was also 15 years ago and a lot of people have careers and families to worry about now, myself included. The game isn't going to be marketed to children to college aged kids and Blizzard would be silly to content-block a whole demographic.
---
But that's not to say the game should change, because it shouldn't. Might find some AV time on the weekends. =)
---
If you both would have fun with those classes, I can't send much faster combination other than 2 hunters which sounds way less cool!
---
I don't have anything against the instance itself, just the fact you have to go in there for enchanting. I'll play two toons and one will be an enchanter. Just have to remember to prepare myself ahead of time.
---
I am not really sure if rushing to OoC is worth it, the proc chance seems to be not that high, so I guess its more efficient to finish the feral tree first

---
But I have 0 experience so maybe I am wrong.
---
Not sure how much powershifting you will do while leveling and in my opinion thats essential for the decision, if  Natural Shapeshifter is worth getting it early. After you got [Wolfshead Helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345) it might be a good choice.
---
* **Tank / Healer** and level in dungeons, my best friend and I do this a lot.  Also it's really strong in the open world
---
* **Mage / Mage** because nothing is quite like a mage
---
* **Druid / Rogue** because you can both stealth, and especially level 10-20+ where the druid is a bear and the rogue is backstabbing, it works out perfect.  (Rogue Rogue is also fun)
---
* **Priest with a Warlock or Paladin** to maximize Shadow or Holy damage spells
---
* **Hunter /** ***Anything*** because the hunter is tank + heals and the "anything" is easy-mode DPS
---
* **Tank / Caster** so the caster can DPS without kiting
---
* **Melee / Healer** so the melee can melee without dying
---
* **Double Up on a Tank or Healing Class** so that one person can DPS.  For example, if you go dual shamans, and one of you really wants to melee DPS, he can.
---
The problem is the one duo I really want is Paladin + Shaman, which I'll have to wait for TBC for.
---
July 16th, mark my words
---
Before reading this I was thinking about doing a shaman, pala oder druid as main in classic, maybe a warrior, but now I'm not interested in all of these calsses. Good job in making every class sounds awful. ;)
---
I wish there was an item that dropped from a MC or BWL raid boss that gave you a free respec every 3 days
---
&gt;My question for any druid players is how viable are they for tanking during the leveling process/ are their any core items that i HAVE to get that might make it easier?
---
They are great dungeon tanks, very capable. They are also very good off tanks in raids apparently since they can go cat form in fights where they are not needed and do more DPS than a prot warrior.
---
Yup. 
---
And usually you're in a main city so it's not a hassle to run and get them. 
---
Daggers, especially with the proper PVP build like in the video, are excellent. Combat daggers is almost as good as combat swords for PVE, the only reason swords is better is if you're human to get the bonus plus 5 skill.
---
General QoL would be NE. Orc and human weapon skill racials are incredibly powerful even while leveling, with Orc being the better of the two.
---
It's not that they suck, it's just that they aren't the best at anything they try to do. They are ok healers but not as good as Paladins, they are ok tanks but not as good as warriors (in general, they are possibly the best offtanks), they are ok DPS but not as good as a Rogue/Mage.
---
This is why they earn the title of jack of all trades, master of none in my opinion. This doesn't mean they are bad, just that they will suit someone who would like to play a true hybrid class.
---
Not if you get a shaman/paladin healer or a cloth healer. I understand everyone may be needing cloth but there’s a chance an uneducated plate or mail user won’t know to take gear with better stats even if the armor type is different. 
---
You walk into my house, get cookie crumbs all over the god damn carpet, and then tell me it's for my own good.  "They wanted their own little world" uhhh yup, has their name on it.
---
Launch day sharding is being implemented to prevent underpopulation, not because they don't have the tech to support all the players. The vast majority of players who play on launch will be tourists who will quit after a week, in order to ensure that servers have a healthy population once the tourists leave blizz will have to set the server population caps crazy high on launch. Assuming a 90% drop off (which is an underestimate if anything) you'd need a population of 30k on launch for a 3k pop server long term.
---
That many people crammed into the starting zones would be unplayable. I played nost launch which had 10k people crammed into the starting zones, and the only way to level was to roam around in groups of five fighting over every mob tag. Now multiply that amount of people by three.
---
True, paladins are pretty bad at DPSing. If that's what you want to do, I'd say the most noob-friendly would probably be mage.
---
Have you tried or considered full time partnering with another player and leveling ?
---
Yeah, engineering is one of the easier professions I find to level as you level your character. And it's loads of fun! (You will definitely need mining, the only way to lvl engineering with out mining is if you are already max level and/or wealthy.)
---
Nah got the game for Christmas. It was a good launch for an mmo but tiny compared to today’s launches because mmorpg was such a niche genre back then, and boxed copy distribution strictly controlled how many people could play.

That's what TBC was for me. I raided with a late night NA PST/Oceanic guild. Before the raid content nerf, our raid schedule was 11p-4a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. BT (or progression) was Thursday, TK &amp; SC (not including bosses) and/or finishing BT was Fridays, Kael, Vashj, Gruuls, &amp; Mag, were Saturdays, 2 ZA groups or the occasional Kara speed run for badges was Sunday. Occasionally we also did an old school raid night where we would go back into say AQ40 or BWL or w/e and just fuck around.  Rest of the week was spent farming for consumes, rep, doing pvp, etc.
---
This was not conducive to maintaining a good GPA lol

You have to admire those people who go all out on there story and always stick to character but that is usually a small portion of the server. Most just RP occasionally

I’m not saying hey won’t know they can; current wow gives you stat boosts for wearing all mail or whatever your type is. What I’m saying is people might not think they will be good if they wear different types. 
---
It's interesting you say this, because I was sitting with my friend at lunch the other day explaining to him what my charitable goals will be in Classic. I'm really going for this "faction strength" ideal this time around, and I want to tank for anybody and everybody on my faction in order to allow them to get stronger, but then I thought about who I should be helping and who would benefit more from my effort.  
---
I concluded that I will help "meme specs", even though I don't support their heavy use in raids. I thought about tanking for a ret paladin if I could find one who was in need. Plate locking the group and pretty much letting him have all the ret gear he needs. He could easily get HoJ because I won't start my charitable tanking until after my pre-raid farm is over.  
---
I figure they won't have good luck getting into raids as ret, but I at least want to give them a fighting chance at strengthening their character.

---
On some fights you can warrant a different pet, but most fights you will always have your wolf parked right next to you.  That’s just the way it is. You can’t spend time healing your pet because it got caught in aoe near boss, and healers are never going to care for your pet. There are a few select fights where you can skip the wolf, but it’s an exception more than anything else. 
---
Man my ignore list is gonna be full after the first week

One of my most memorable wow memories was a RP raid on thunderbluff RP and pvp can be a blast.
---
Yeah, but this is about leveling.
---
That is TrinketMenu.
---
Most classes will end up working well together.  The biggest factors are that you have an easier time killing groups of enemies.  Two fast classes just burst through groups of enemies.  Two slow classes greatly increase the margin for error.  And a slow and fast class balance each other out.
---
I think the onus is on us, the veterans of classic and the people who have been there and know what we are doing, at least the basics, to really be ambassadors for the classic experience. We don't need to manufacture any artificial community, but in the spirit of vanilla, just help those who need help.
---
You can definitely tell when people are floundering and when they are just lazy. If you were there in vanilla, just remember how many times you helped people complete quests, and people helped you, even if you weren't on the same quest. Or remember how often a shout out for help was actually answered and people responded - and world pvp ensued.
---
I'm no font of arcana, as I just have my memories, not having played on private servers, but I'll be doing my best to help, those in my guild and friends, and those strangers who through a positive interactions may very well become one or the other.
---
Just remember how many times in vanilla you ran an instance and played with people who didn't really know what they were doing: yeah so the lock didn't know what a soulstone was at level 60. Don't abuse them for being an idiot and vote to kick, spend 2 minutes helping another player be better at their class and everyone benefits.
---
100% agree with the OP, most of the people playing classic will not have done it for a decade, or at all, but with our help, they should pick it up pretty quick. WoW isn't exactly difficult to learn.
---
Trying to do Ashenvale quests near BFD and the horde's outpost... get ganked and run back through the entire zone basically.

---
I've never played a hunter, but I can't imagine why you shouldn't be able to micro your pet on bosses.  
---
Human's in WoW actually have quite a significant amount of options.
---
They are almost completely different communities. The private server community is almost entirely male and European. Retail Classic will be Americans and far more mixed gendered.

**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.

For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.  
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.  
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Shamans &amp; Resto Druids.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message (Discord:

I found it more frustrating than anything while leveling. The proc rate was super random. Sometimes I'd get 3 procs on 1 mob, other times I'd go 5+ mobs without a single proc.
---
I think it could also be fun to have a duo that is unconventional that may struggle in certain situations together. Luckily we still have months to think everything through! 
---
That's a bold statement.
---
The mathematical average for OoC is supposedly 3 ppm. The thing is, it works for all of your spells so you get free spell casts. It can have a big impact on your leveling speed because it cuts down a lot of downtime.
---
You can always play whatever you want, just don't whine when you aren't allowed into raiding guilds.
---
And my point is that they will learn that it's not the case before 60 . I want to add also that it's not just the leveling time, it's the community too. You will play with friends you made along the way, you'll do dungeon while leveling, you'll probably even have a guild before you reach 60. It's just really unlikely to get to lv 60 and still not knowing you should equip gear from whatever has the best stats.
---
Put a NSFL on this. Those hotbars and hotkeys are grotesque.
---
It’s ok, there were about 1 billion other players that played NE Hunter.
---
Jumping into BGs/wpvp and wrecking face benefits me on a personal level immensely.
---
My first time playing as a caster and warlock....
---
some of us want to play the game, not tab-spamming to tag level 2 wolves because there's literally hundreds of humans in elwynn forest.
---
You're assuming most players will make it that far!
---
Oh come on man. You cried. I know you cried!  
---
At least I'd have been crying like a little girl if my guild did that for me loool.  
---
I'll always take a mr. fatkin.
---
Rushing OoC definitely isn't worth it, the proc rate is way too unreliable and just ends up being more frustration at not getting procs.
---
Over ten years later and I still think about this a lot - these guys were like family to me and I hope wherever they all are they’re living their best lives
---
Why not just edit your chat window to only include guild chat
---
&gt;Let the one fat kid who spams /y 24/7 from the IF bridge or Org bank deal with the actual enchanting.
---
Are you trying to say that doing dungeons and battlegrounds burns more calories than selling enchants? They both look like sitting in front of a computer to me.
---
Molten Core and Onyxia are about LFR difficulty. Tons of people will be able to clear those two raids. BWL is a step up and will therefore be more exclusive, and AQ40 and Naxx will be even bigger steps up. We will not see a &lt;1% figure for Naxx clears again. It won't be high, but it will absolutely not be as low.
---
If you're taking so much damage that you're running out of mana healing yourself, then you're doing something wrong.
---
But for real this time. 
---
Honestly just go for the wolf as most other pets will die in melee range - If you care about maxing your dps. 
---
Main usage of a hunter in a raid group isn't the dps though, so if you prefer a different pet I suggest going for it as long as you do your job
---
I need to keep track of warriors who won’t tank, ret paladins, balance druids etc so I don’t accidentally invite them to my groups 
---
literally none of that nonsense about pvp battles of level 1-4 players will happen.
---
In what version of classic wow will that level range of the opposition faction meet? 
---
It's purely delusional to think people are going to pass up the nostalgia of reliving classic wow to do such a thing.
---
Maybe blizzard can't set aside "shit" servers without sharding on launch so you can tab-spam contesting over a level 4 boar. it'd be a really nice way to make people go "Fuck this, back to private servers it is" and population tank the same day. not to mention the immediate refund requests. 
---
File this one under "dying on the hill for #nochanges". downgrade your PC to a 2-core for longer load times for "original design".
---
thank you - i fix this in the overview :-)
---
Then a big boobed girl came and let you motorboat her and she brought cool aid and then you did a sick ollie with your skateboard and said "sup" after putting on your sunglasses and a trex in the distance roared 
---
Its going to be hilarious, looking at how big the private servers community is, there is going to be a massive difference between the private servers community and all the new people that never played, also the amount of misinformation about vanilla is insane, so the new people is going to have a hard time catching up, but its doable, just u know, when the new players got to 200-300g the pro players will have 5k, full guilds coming from private servers to the official servers, etc, i really want to see how it end after a few months of the release.
---
This is pretty amazing.  However the only thing I hate is the excessive use of addons.  They basically tell him when to use the next stun, and swap his trinkets for him, and tell him when his energy is going to tick.  It's still an impressive display of skill but like... to me it's tainted by the addons.  I get that i'm an irrational purist though.
---
Marked
---
Nothing wrong with using the default blizzard bars. God forbid someone doesn't use addons to change every single aspect of the game.
---
Posts like this make r/classicwow such a chore
---
Sincerely hope there will be others like you :)
---
I didnt check every toon but I have at least 8000 hours of played time, I have been slowly reducing my time on though!
---
This is great.
---
Your dad’s a genius btw, using his son as a pocket healer
---
I had a friend in vanilla who I still know to this day. She bought me Belt of the Archmage for my character and it blew my mind. Funny since usually guys are trying to buy things for girls, lol. I was so happy about the belt, it was only my second ever epic.  
---
She must have loved my ass in some weird way to work so hard trying to get my character up to power.  
---
Fury Warriors do the best DPS class in the game, but okay pal.
---
How do disc/holy, disc/smite and trispec fare in 1v1 and group world PvP?
---
What is disc/smite damage output like?
---
Asking for a friend
---
There is mandatory dancing!
---
Pairs are just hipster apples, change my mind. 
---
Let him figure things out with a nooby twinkle in his eye on release the way Elune intended.
---
FRAPS
---
&gt; We will not see a &lt;1% figure for Naxx clears again. It won't be high, but it will absolutely not be as low.
---
Might be lower with the fuckton of people who will join, play until level 15 and then never play again. Percentage wise tourists will skew all the numbers.
---
Theres nothing wrong with playing sub-optimal builds but the way I see it, those roles need to be earned.  If you are a good player, farm pre-bis, use consumes, have good raid attendance then I don't mind playing with "meme" specs.  The issue is when people do none of that and show up to raid doing fuck all and expecting to be carried.  Then when u call them out on it they say shit like "don't tell me how to play the game" or "its just molten core, we cleared anyway"
---
I don't mean titan panel.
---
I am talking about how you have a macro named "2" on your 1 slot, and a macro named "1" on your 2 slot. You then have two other macros named "1" and "2" and another named "222".
---
I am talking about how you have 5 action bars and each one is only half full. The bars are sporadically filled with random gaps. Most of them don't have hotkeys, and no hotkeys for pet commands.
---
It's not exactly common either. You'd have to practically sit there for 5 minutes getting hit and healing yourself back up in order to get full reckoning stacks.
---
Here's a tier list of the best classes;

8. WHATEVER

7. CLASS

6. YOU

5. WANT

4. AND
---
3. HAVE

2. FUN

1. ROGUE

Isn't this the reason why the Garrosh fight in MoP has to reset his HP bar several times to properly use the intended amount of HP? I remember something about how his intended HP amount would violate something and reset to a negative number and they fixed it by just making his HP bar reset itself through the stages.
