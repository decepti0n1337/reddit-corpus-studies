Imagine quitting at the slightest sign of resistance.

&gt; Now how did he make all those instant raid text messages appear?
---

---
/rw (raid warning) is how you make those raid text messages, requires you to be either leader or assist
---
Go to any other competitive team based game and it's literally the same. Nobody in any game wants to play with people who don't pull their weight. 
---
You are just looking at the past with rose colored glasses.
---
Lvl 19 twinking already a thing? 😮
---
I wish I had fun at 60.
---
I think for me the difference is the amount of time needed to do anything at 60.
---
Besides BGs you basically need at least 3h to do a few dungeons or a raid. 
---
I'm casual I sometimes play for 5 hours but usually only a few. I cant commit to a raiding schedule and its easier for me to pug with anyone who is on.
---
Unfortunately thats usually late at night and I chose a server that's 2h earlier than me (fucking friends that quit).
---
Who said anything about quitting? How about you don't intentionally force a turtle by defending stupid objectives
---
Oof a holy pally with it?  Oof.
---
&gt;     I really hope that Blizzard bans ~~Spy Addon~~ Combat Log
---
This topic has been done to death. It pulls information from the combat log that everyone has access to. It just puts it together in a neat package for you. 
---
They already addressed this by making the combat log radius 50yd.
---
PvE server ;P
---
Rogue warlock. Shadowy daggers, a demon pet, sacrificial pact, fearing enemies.. unbeatable 👊
---
Agreed. It ruins the fun, especially for rogues.
---
We don’t have a queue.
---
Grind rams and wolves in AV. Best of both worlds!
---
AV confirmed best lvling strategy?
---
Yeah that's what I'm realizing. Just can't get that vanilla nostalgia off classic wow. But subs been gone anyway.  And I see alot of people feel the same way too about the game
---
Like blizzard gives a fuck unless they can automate it.
---
Just hang in there for dementia... and then resub!
---
It’s not stupid if you’re going for a particular rank. 
---
The *system* is stupid, sure, but people aren’t stupid for pursuing goals.
---
I just hit 60 on my Boomy and the mana issues are so exaggerated. I just did my first MC (pug) and I didn’t even need innervate for all but like 2 bosses. The only time I was flat fucking oom was the last adds on Garr
---
The addon is nothing like it used to be. It’s been nerfed already severely, I don’t really see it as a big issue anymore.
---
This picture is everything.
---
Ive literally never been on any competitive game where someone got mad cause you don't play 80+ hours a week either.
---
Agreed. Item level does nothing but breed elitism and toxicity in my opinion.
---
Pretty much the last point. Was just doing random AV, game started and on the way south random dude from another server write me this. Nothing before, dont know him, nor did I said/do anything before.
---
52 (maybe 53?) agi per crit for hunter.
---
Hey buddy, honestly not alot man. I think the official HK count from the second clip was somewhere between 90-107hk's. Was only getting approx 15-20 Honor per kill. We just did it for fun, about time Alliance had some fun at the Hordes expense :)
---
Love this movie, man.
---
Dude bots are actually killing Classic, why cant Blizz identify them and do a ban-wave like they did on HonorBuddy users...
---
Onyxia can easily be cleared with 20-30 people if they are decently geared and know the fight mechanics really well.
---
Molten Core can be cleared with 30-40 people but anything less than 30 is gonna be a struggle even with proper gear.
---
You're a moron. Let people enjoy the game the way they feel like and if efficient face-paced is that way, there's nothing wrong with it. I might think it's stupid that you spend 3x more time doing something than an efficient player but I don't give enough of a fuck to scream about it every chance I get because it literally affects no one.
---
Yup. I explain this to all druids who go "but I'm a cat/bear/owl".
---
No. You're a druid. Be flexible. You think the bear and owl can dance like that when they're so uptight? Hell no
---
Fun story. We had the ret paladin trying to get into one of our 2 main raid teams. Over the last month or so, there was growing dissatisfaction with guild leadership and one night 40 of the best parsing raiders from the two teams split and formed a new guild. This ret paladin then asks in guild chat "Is there a spot for ret now?" and 5 people all instantly responded "NO" and he immediately gquit.
---
If I was a mage I would say the same, but as a rogue it is really annoying and puts us in a great disadvantage.
---
I’ve noticed each day people evolve their strategy and the meta shifts. I think it’s actually really cool to watch happen.
---
Herod?
---
I thought they did already, also as a mage indo this constantly in PvP no addon needed.  I can spam rank 1 arcane explosion all day.
---
Well, no of our warriors wanted it so far and we dont have a retri pala. And as I want to PvP as ret and wanna try it out at least once in a raid, while also willing to farm for it, I was the best match.
---
Next one will go to a holy paladin aswell most likely as none of our warriors still want it^^
---
I keep seeing different answers on the internet lol: is the consumable from Lei of Lillies on the same CD timer as potions? Also healthstones?
---
As a sword and board traditional tank... I'm offended :-P
---
For sure they are. You're probably top 25 of your raid dps.
---
16 hours a day of av is sure to give you a stroke, probably slow down a bit.
---
Moms are great.
---
Heres mine
---
[https://i.imgur.com/JqSIbJp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JqSIbJp.jpg)
---
I try to keep it clean, putting exp and rep bars into TitanPanel. Also got RareElites working with SUF.
---
no because trying to win is often losing very bad
---
Ah, that's way worse than my guess lol.  So around 0.3% crit or so for 15 agility.
---
It’s the healers job... yours is the one without CD and you want it on all adds instantly
---
So. Heres the thing.
---
Moonkins usually use max level star fire. This is wrong. You oom too fast. You use wrath or lower level spells until you get the proc for a free spell then use max rank.
---
Most moonkin gear also usually has a lot of crit and no mana regen. Get mp5. Int. And crit. You'll do more damage over time.
---
Again. You're still a druid. Use your innervate on the heals. Toss a regrowth on a dps warr pulling threat. Use your abilities man.
---
Hell. The mobs on the healer? Go fucking bear and taunt that bitch. No caster I know can do that.
---
I've had a similar thought. It'll definitely depend on how many people do it but could be a decent way to rank up. I mean if everyone did it (not going to happen) then all the alts would be in bottom 50% and everyone else in the top.
---
Awesome thanks much
---
Thanks buddy :)
---
people where saying that vanilla is hard but MC is easy most of the time. the hard part was referring to leveling and how much time a lot of the things take to do which is kinda true. I don't believe anyone thought MC would be hard though.
---
How is a feral putting FF on all adds of a fight? Yikes
---
You've clearly never been in an AV for an entire day with no end in sight lol.
---
TukUI's chat module, with Prat for class colors and timestamps.
---
Something to make previous raid tiers relevant. I don't necessarily mean old expansions, I actually enjoy the fact that the main reason to go back is for transmog and I'd hate having to learn 4 expansion old fights, but like right now if I dinged I'd like to run Uldir for loot and stuff. LFR is just bad, it's a miserable experience that either culminates in loot pinatas (but the loot is outclassed by dungeons and world drops) or has one-shot mechanics that wipe the raid of 20 something people that don't pay attention.
---
they dont need a buff, just make them immune to disarm. Then they'll hurt
---
A couple off the top of my head
---
* Challenging quests and zones that are kinda tough even with a five-man, available to both factions. One of my most memorable experiences continues to be P1 Stromgarde.
---
* Quests that require materials that can only be obtained through professions you might not have
---
He’s one lucky dude for sure.
---
Talent trees
---
Lot of iffy info here. Check out the hunter classic discord and you can get all the info you need.
---
I like :)
---
Maybe let them enjoy how they like to play and you can do the same? K? Cool
---
Supposedly there was a ban wave last week, but I don't know the popular bot forums to check them out for myself
---
not to mention all the sithilid
---
Anyway was talking about a hypothetical scenario where a group of people were constantly on standby for me for whenever I felt like moving some cardboard or plastic around.
---
You think warriors are sundering every single add?
---
thank you, awful to hear, i guess we all really should just be healers..
---
nice, ok.
---
bOtS aRe kIlINg clAsSiC
---
Idk why I just thought of this (probably the warlock threat discussion), but does anyone remember in AQ when Mages could finally be fire and then whichever poor bastard crit first would have all the other (we ran with like 6 mages) mages’ ignite damage added to their threat? 
---
Such a fun game of roulette.
---
I currently tank Baron and Rag since I have high fire resist and still cause good threat which is great for druids. also being able to charge Rag when he knocks a tank back is great :)
---

---
This is your friend for quick reference to items :) 
---
Look up https://classicdb.ch/?item=16422 and https://classicdb.ch/?item=23294
---
there is a full blue set. I personally will use the legs/ chest for threat since my other pieces are fine.  If you are dkp then yes save for accuria and DFT!! 
---
also look up the boots off Nef when bwl come out.  you will NEVER replace them for tanking in classic wow https://classicdb.ch/?item=19381
---
biggest items for us to look for in bwl is malfurion's chest, the neff boots, and dft.  Also the belt / shoulders are pretty free since not as good for rogues/warriors.  
---
I have obsessively been awaiting bwl and looking for what gear we can get next phase for druid tanks since it is hard to find haha.
---
As the unofficial official Transmog Officer of my old guild in Retail.. I am really missing the outfit options haha.  
---
I am getting geared enough though that I'm considering swapping my boots and shoulders to things that more closely match my 5set night slayer gear even though it will be minor stat loss
---
What about reck reck bombs?
---
Reckoning+recklessness synergy would genuinely pop 7.5k on the next auto no?
---
I liked this. Good work.
---
That's just bonus honor, a lot of them have close to 200 HKs as well which is going to really add up. I'd say it's conservative to guess 30 honor per kill average, with 160 kills is 4800 more honor. I think guessing that they got 1000 rep from this BG is also extremely conservative. So our conservative estimate for this game is 10k honor and 1000 rep.
---
As horde, with an 8 minute queue, 2 minute prep phase, and a 10 minute loss, it takes 20 minutes to lose 1 game for ~3k honor and 300 rep. We gotta add the queue and prep phase to the total of this game to get a fair comparison, so lets say this game took 58 minutes.
---
8 minute loss (counting queue times, prep time, assuming 3k honor and 300 rep) = 9,000 honor per hour, 900 rep per hour
---
48 minute victory = 10,344 honor per hour, 1034 rep per hour
---
And again, these are conservative estimates. I bet they got much more than 1000 rep for this game, people handing in armor scraps and blood gives rep to the whole team! With &gt; 5k *bonus* honor, they completed pretty much every possible objective that gives bonus honor, and all of those bonus honor objectives also give rep. 
---
And of course, there's many other benefits to this 48 minute win. You spend the whole time in a BG playing the game instead of sitting in org in a queue. You get the thrill of a win. You get the thrill of not only denying the alliance a win, but denying them pretty much any honor at all. Best of all, you actually get to PvP in your PvP!
---
So yeah, I'll take the 48 minute turtle.
---
One of my all time favorite games.
---
The same thing happened to me, we didn't have a ret pally anymore so it went to me as a holy pally. Though they also said I should go ret instead to fill in the empty roll of guild meme
---
"you have to be an above average player" lol. Your the perfect example
---
It is not about honor, it is about rep. 
---
The turtles just screw that for everyone. Both horde  and ally.
---
lol blizzard can get fucked. not going back to that.
---
Dude AV queus are like instant right now and they take 7 mins to run each
---
Tell me more? That have a much different setup?
---
Talent tree. I was one of the talent tree haters but after playing classic I realized I really love it. Expand it to WotLK size and bring back the crazy hybrid specs.
---
Orange man bad. Pink spec bad. Everything bad. Why me play?
---
Yeah I get what you mean, it would be cool if all fresh 120s would need to start with like normal Uldir or something if they wanted to get into raiding, not just jump straight to eternal palace. Kinda like how even with AQ and Naxx in vanilla, fresh 60s still gotta start with either MC or a catchup raid like ZG.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The reintroduction of small catch up raids would be a good idea too, Crucible of storms could easily have made a good one.
---
Hard to tell there are anyone else on the server, every zone is a GHOSTTOWN.
---
I just logged back in, and it lands me on the last page of a survey asking why I want to unsubscribe. So I'm still not 100% sure that I successfully unsubscribed yesterday. Lol these clowns.
---
Lol i wont lie its nice to have a turtle ever few hours to break up the meta cheese. But after 45 minutes it just gets boring as all hell as horde sit there do nothing while alliance sit and wait for a L but horde want to drag it out so they do literally nothing.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, the hit cap everyone talks about has bosses in mind, who are all (i think) lvl 63... so lvl 60 orc with an axe need those 6 % to be hit capped against bosses, but against lvls 60 its deffiniely less % needed.
---
It's just another example of more experienced players trolling unsuspecting noobs. Basically the same thing as the old "press f10" in counter strike games.
---
Although I dont mind the retail talent system, it would be cool to see them reintroduce the old talent system in combination with the current one possibly.
---
This fellow needs to seek therapy for his mental illness.
---
Horde eu still rocking 7 min queue.
---
What server are you on? My queues are about 8min on horde - faerlina.
---
Every new expansion removes flying and it doesn't make the game much better, just more tedious, especially with verticality of modern wow environmental design.
---
What else do you want me to say? You’re character is broke and the default frames don’t mesh well with that ui
---
Sweet thank you.. would be really cool if there was a calculator for that.
---
How are you hardened, true warriors if you're still scared of an open world event and are now just hiding in BGs
---
There are 2 different pot CDs.
---
One for regular potions like healing / mana / free action etc.
---
and then there's one of for weird items like mage mana gem, whipper root, healthstone, dark/demonic rune, and the lei of lillies consumables.
---
Spriest + Warlock. Look i can stance into 15% shadow damage. Sack a demon for 15% shadow damage, get a buff when i crit with shadow bolt, and stack a +15% shadow damage debuff on what i attack. not to mention in 5 GDs i can get to 95% hp and mana. I'd be the one class to use the least amount of mana pots and health pots.
---
You don't get anything if you kill after the other faction
---
I don't even have 30 hours a week to play so I guess I have no room to be playing.
---
Or he could just do whatever he wants and you can stop pestering him. "Nooo, you're not enjoying yourself right! &gt;:("
---
That's classic, freedom.
---
Think hes lying or his poor hygiene from playing so much wow actually is the reason he is sick?
---
If it takes longer than 3 seconds for my queue to pop I start wondering if I clicked the wrong button.
---
If they're like me it's just 15 minutes on an alt.
---
Oh by the way. I'm not even lvl 50 so I'm not raiding or trying to join that. I just try my best to play casually and not piss off any pro's for doing that
---
Their portrait
---
If your warriors are using most of the useful consumables + world buffs, the milisecs the furious howl buff is up on the warr is enough to push off the oldest buff, i.e. songflower or DM buff. Advice against using wolf if buff slots are tight, especially on alliance.
---
Immensely better. I can actually land in a Everspring and not immediately die at the flightmaster. I even flew afk to the flight master and came back and I was still alive after sitting there for a few min.
---
Repost
---
No idea if this would work but what if you copy pasted the new executable and renamed it to the old one, so that now you have both?
---
Seems like it.
---
Shit post
---
Well the first two days were really the time when a gun was to our heads, because those were the easiest two days to gain rep, now the games seem a little more varied to me at least. I'm sad I'm only revered though, kinda feel like I missed the boat.
---
THOSE BARS COULD HAVE SUSTAINED THE GUILD! THINK OF THE CHILDREN THAT WILL GO HUNGRY NOW!
---
He called Trump rich so I think he's not on the side you're thinking
---
you can
---
This game* in a nutshell
---
Fixed.
---
Those pieces are pretty solid. I already have warstrife and Blademaster with 1% dodge ench on both so not too much of an upgrade there but definitely an upgrade for my warbear harness. (Working towards breastplate of bloodthirst)
---
Nobody wants to buy Whitescale Salmon.
---
When you get enough stam you can usually survive the first stun lock.
---
Just the first clip. I just threw all the clips I had into one little video. Sadly the mages learned fast what I was doing.
---
I feel the same way about my PvP server. It's been a lot of fun.
---
Im kind of a noob so I still play the first way :) that feeling of wonder has never ceased to amaze me. I'm 15 years late to the party but loving every minute of it.
---
Leveling isn't really a big deal.  I didn't level as balance but leveled mostly resto.  Basically the same thing just slightly less damage.
---
You just have to drink a lot.  Hit 60 in around 10 days questing the entire way.  Not super fast but I wasn't rushing or anything. 
---
It's almost like playing a mage that can only single target.  You can kill things fast but have to drink for 30 seconds every 2-3 kills.
---
Hah, you got wreckt on the internet
---
I wasn't talking about 100% avoidance, i was talking about my hit and their defense means 100% hit... 0% chance of avoidance. Thank you for the answer about needing less hit though.
---
Mainly norwegian u mean

---
My server isn’t particularly unbalanced but I’ve been racking in the herbs since BGs launched.
---
Have people been able to find dungeon groups since battlegrounds came out? I'm on a populated server (Horde on Stallag) and I feel like the finding group channels are a ghost town right now
---
I personally don't go around and downvote everyone who has a different opinion from myself. I personally would report people fishing as AFK and write in BG channel to report them as well.
---
You will hate to hear that I got HOJ my first try.  I guess that’s why the RNG gods won’t let me get arcane crystals.
---
This doesn't work for Horde, and would mean waiting 7 more minutes for each queue that doesn't match up.
---
Removing the lottery of tertiary and forging would fix this and probably cause me to return.  Item level exists in Classic and isnt the issue.  The problem is I can get my bis piece but it didnt roll correctly so it's not the best.  Gear should have meaningful progress patch to patch without the added lottery system.
---
Buy you have to enlist voluntarily.
---
There are over 300 AVs going at a time. It doesn't work like that for Horde.
---
Those bars belong in a museum!
---
Second that for Morgan’s Vigil. It was guaranteed death on landing. The first night after BG’s releases I got all the way into BRM without seeing a single horde. Only PvP engagement was at the MC port which didn’t even result in a death
---
Why does low level +Frost gear sell at such a high price if stacking Int and Stamina is superior? Do many people not know how to gear for AOE farming?
---
Big true. Ally have insta ques so a little easier
---
Moonkin is terrible for flag carrying.
---
You want 31 points in resto for NS and Swiftmend.   Then you spec feral charge and Natures Grasp.
---
One time my alliance queue took 3s to pop.
---
Wait for real? So we don't have paladins all running around with free Ashbringers anymore?
---
They were my least favorite thing about Legion, not getting to loot weapons was a major let down.
---
is there addon which makes that when i am in raid,it puts white color for priest,green for hunters etc
---
righ now everybodys name is in same color and i need to hover over it to see what class they r
---
Then you move in weird ways. I'm rarely attacked like that when healing teammates.
---
Oh no, now Paladins can't burst people down like rogues. How unfair.
---
Tranquil air totem.
---
It's going to be less.  
---
Mainly because the hardcore rep farmers, and a lot of alliance will have completed the farm.  
---
And as the hype dies down, queue times will increase (especially for Horde).  
---
And the games get longer as people will stop rushing. We'r already seeing games becoming longer on average, and queue times are increased.
---
It's still not an extensive reputation grind if you get a few games in as often as possible. You can knock it out easily on a Emissary weekend (which I'm not sure if they are in the game yet).
---
You’re not a human being so I can use the word
---
lolololololol I came here for the exact same reason. Guess I"ll be waiting for him to respawn.
---
I want them to remove titanforging. I am okay with stats being calculated from ilvl so there arent any weird items that are really good compared to others, but I want to be able to run dungeons to finish my list of gear I want. I want to be able to look at my gear and say that I am now done gearing until next content if I put in enough effort, instead of going the same dungeon over and over afain because my titanforged piece didnt have a socket as well..
---
I wanted to respecc to elemental for PvP. But I honestly didn't want to bother farming Elemental gear. So I just queued in heal specc because I'm a cheap motherfucker and realised just how great I am in BG's as a resto shaman.
---
Gotta be able to survive the carnage of the rest of the super classes
---
*THE ONLY WINNERS
---
Losing quickly is the fastest way to ear the rewards. And getting the rewards is the real win.
---
Those bots aren’t “AI’s” my dude...
---
&gt;you haven’t lived until you’ve picked up bezerker, popped toep, and had a priest power infusion you just as you get close to the enemy flag carrier, it’s a blast.
---
This is legit why I came back to this game and rolled a mage :)
---
Haven’t seen another person out in the open world since BG’s dropped.  Been pretty nice honestly.
---
Stay mad dude
---

---
Dollars to donuts, most people care more about rep right now.
---
Every level the mob is lower than you reduces their chance to parry/dodge/block or for you to miss them by 0.2%. Block generally doesn't matter so basically for every level the mob is lower than you, you hit it 0.6% more often.
---
It's only about rep if you plan to do AV for 3 days and then never again. A lot of people in AV are already exalted.
---
Sooo many suggestions, but let me point out there is nothing like 'making the game objectively better' it's always making it better from a certain point of view.
---
But what would make it better IN MY OPINION? I'd say more competetion between players (mining/herb nodes) in and across fractions, the every1 gets everything mentality doesn't feel right to me.
---
Also getting rid of all ingame purchases would be great IMO, but that's never gonna hapen I guess. You're paying for game time and content packs already after all.
---
This is so cool to read.
---
Oh i totally agree.  I swung alliance because I'd much rather be on the less popular side.  Ally was way more poo in vanilla but all indications showed huge horde bias this time around.  So glad i made the right investment.
---
By the lack of search results, I'm guessing it's not allowed/possible to change the sound effect for when a fish bites while fishing? I'd like to watch some shows while fishing, but I like to actually pay attention to the visuals in the show instead of staring at a bobber.
---
The players at the top haven't changed, it's just that the average player is more informed now.  Top players knew their BIS items and optimal rotations back then too.
---
The reason you see top players doing stupid damage in raids is more about the 1.12 itemization and class changes in comparison to the patch top players were actually doing the content with in vanilla.
---
The meta AV strat used by top guilds today to max honor/rep is the same as it was back then in Vanilla patch 1.12 (at least for alliance where I play).  The issues today were issues back then too, people just weren't there for it or somehow forgot.
---
Lol right. Classic is killing classic.
---
Rogue is better but if you're still talking about front shredding it shows you don't really have any experience with feral in classic. With fast kill times, pummelers, bis gear and full consumes feral can get 800-900 DPS in molten core and it will be better in bwl. Shedo is probably the best example. The real outlier that feral cats will never catch is fury warriors.
---
Hahahah. Savage Reddit burn +1
---
Don't think I've ever waited more than 8 minutes
---
Speak for yourself. I’m 100% better at the game than I was at 14 years old and still love it, still love the environments and music pieces and the atmosphere of it all. Dire Maul specifically has been absolutely gorgeous and was a place I never really went to before, now I’m in there solo as a Hunter all the time and it’s my favorite place in the game, gold farming wise and aesthetically.
---
Just won 4/4
---
Hilarious that ally have a huge advantage and still are losing. Also played like 5 games last night and got 15k honor
---
Yea it's possible on alliance. Not horde.
---
lmao what won't Alliance do to avoid PvP.
---
Both ways of playing the game aren't wrong in their own in a vacuum. But there's friction when both ways to play the game are forced to coexist in the same space. Each type of player is self-subscribing to a different set of rules. Usually the optimized minmax player will outperform the more casual/whimsical player when it comes to grinding, farming, raiding, PVP, etc. 
---
It's like a pre-robotic factory line vs automated robotic factory lines. The robot factories are going to produce more cars more accurately more repetitively for less money. That's why every car factory has robots now. Anybody who rebuilds their own cars is usually doing it for hobby or filling some kind of niche market. Now if the hobbyist had to compete directly with a robotic factory in the same marketplace...
---
Note that I'm not making a judgement of what " intentional losing " is or not. 
---
I am discussing whether the practice of actively encouraging others to "lose fast " or  "losing strategy is better"  should be frowned upon or not.
---
Skill in wPVP? Are you talking about the raid camping brm or the ship in menethil?
---
If you want a skillbased game you can play dota or csgo, mmorpgs are by design time rewarding, not skill rewarding.
---
You cant tell me that it was fun sitting infront of a fp waiting for lowbies to land and press 1 button to spam aoe abilities.
---
Please show it on the doll where the bad paladin touched you, sweety.
---
I sell HoJ runs and we have seen it drop about 14 times in 70 runs xD. 
---
I guess I’m just lucky :P
---
Rams are awesome! And alliance already have the most badass mount with the tigers. Gotta share the badassness
---
Come. To heartseeker and be hardened by war.
---
Oh.
---
I see, I think they meant stacking the threat reduction trinkets from Thaddeus, and Fenkriss along with the cloak enchant and the set bonus from either T2 or T3.
---
What about not playing AV if you can't deal with other people playing it the other way than you deemed fun.
---
because you are alliance.....................
---
I'm on board now too.
---
Standard dps fury tanks 5mans just fine.  No need to try to get fancy.
---
nice one
---
Yep! I've seen DD in a few AVs
---
Imagine thinking bots are killing classic.
---
Razorgore!
---
I saw HoJ drop for the first time 40+ runs in. The resto druid needed and won :(.
---
Fuck darragh
---
Send logs please would be interested to review
---
Look at the bonus honor of the alliance in that screenshot, over half of the alliance at the end of the game weren't there at the beginning of the game. I really think 30 honor per kill average is probably pretty close, including the penalty. I also only counted 160 HKs in the calculation even though some had more.
---
What would be your best guess for honor from 160 HKs in a 48 minute game?
---
Honestly you're probably better off without anybody who falls for that.
---
Do you really just assume that they are bots because they haven’t named their pet?
---
I lost my 50/50 to a resto druid :(
---
Just do /reload when the queue pop and then enter. Problem solved
---
Depends on the cost.  For dagger rogues it's easy, dagger skill is plentiful and on good items.  For other class/specs, 308 isn't worth it right now because the weapon skill is so scarce.
---
Can you link your logs?  Would love to review thx
---
Gz!
---
Sounds like you're confusing "AI" for something far more narrow, like machine learning maybe.  Even the trade goods vendor in Org that just walks a set path up and down the Drag is an example of AI, albeit really basic AI.
---
But you forget that every alliance player is also a healer. At least that is how it seems.
---
Some people are just unhappy in real life and it spills into the only thing they got. So we get to deal with that on here AND IN GAME..
---
Isn’t that what they did to diablo 3? I didn’t like that bit of it.
---
Back in vanilla I realized the best part of this game were the battlegrounds and the 60 battlegrounds are broken unless you get raid gear which I am not going to do.
---
Galv gives you honor of you kill him before horde kills Belinda.
---
Where do you get anger in this post? I didn’t insult you, I calmly explained why you are being antisocial.
---
You not wanting to engage further and hiding behind a straw man demonstrates exactly my point.
---
You couldn’t even answer a simple question like, “Why not get free guild water from your mages in guild?”
---
Look if you didn’t want to know why you are being antisocial, why ask?
---
Big true. How do you make money without risking leveling?
---
Omen of Clarity doesn't work like that lmao.
---
You’re right, but you really come across as an asshole.
---
What’s funny is people complain about everything. Even when it’s changes completely.
---
I can deal with it I just think you're an idiot for intentionally chosing a turtle when horde typically win them. You can rush and win the majority of games while still pvping a decent amount or you could turtle, lose most games, and do nothing for 45 minutes
---
They camped us at BRM. They killed me 10 times when I was on my way to farm lashers. Now we are wrecking them in their GY after taking every cap on the map, winning game after game. Zug zug.
---
I believe 150 is lowest skill requirement to fish there.
---
My god this is so accurate
---
I guess you had a bad experience with a rogue?
---
Deadly boss mods
---
Warrior and priest
---
I know this is exactly how you get stuck in a 3 hour AV match, but part of me really wants to re-live this one more time. Just once, though.
---
Goes for about 700 to 800g on my server - rattlegore
---
I was thinking people would be good in pvp .... nop, no many inbreed. Like people ressing and instead of getting the flag carrier that is exiting our tunnel they go fight midfield .... or , I m with a paly vs 2 hunter (I am a lock) never he put blessing of protection on me ..... (i have the 2 pet on me &amp; 1 hunter). I was thinking the player quality would be better than private server, but it is way worse. I even think it was even better 15 years ago.
---
Damn. None of my PUGs seem to think attacking the healer is a good idea. They just blindly melee the bear druid or prot warrior in front of them while there are 2 priests standing back spamming flash heals on him. Or at least that’s how several of my matches went last night...
---
FOCUS THE HEALERS GUYS PLEASE HEALERS ARE INFINITE HEALTH BATTERIES IF YOU DON’T FOCUS THEM
---
that would be impossible.
---
Have to turn the quests in, otherwise I'm going to spend the next day thinking about how much xp I will get or what I'm going to do after which will make me unable to do anything
---
3 is the minimum
---
I got my HoJ on my 167 kill. Not kidding. It was... fun.
---
Lost my last week of game time because of gankers. No way i'm playing again.
---
100% agree with you. BG lv 49 is the best
---
Fly from Org up to Azshara and fish
---
I tried to do Un'goro on my Warrior 2 weeks ago and I got killed 5 times before I could even grab all the quests. I went back last night and did the whole zone without ever being attacked. BGs are a godsend for slow levelers/alts on PvP realms.
---
what spec?
---
I had no problem with people zerging it. It's efficient. Even when you lose on a 10 minute match it's not a big deal. But now, spending like 30 minutes on each game. Not my cup of tea.
---
This is the AV everyone wanted.
---
https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=39622
---
It actually has the best faeriefire upkeep in the game because resto druids don't have +spell hit and feral druids are on a cd (sometimes raids won't even have feral either).
---
Haha, I've tried several times to get into it, but I'm too much of a carebear for Dark Souls. My enjoyment of games doesn't often stem from the challenge as it does for a lot of people. I can appreciate that it is a very well crafted and unique series though.
---
That'd be Westfall general chat.
---
I'm not entirely hurt by this action. I understand why they did this, but I also understand why people may be upset that it has been patched. I'm  Just stating it's gone.
---
So like 3 DAY LONG AV's?
---
Actually pvping in a battleground? Yeah #nochanges.
---
It sucks it takes a lot of runs, but at least they are short and usually chain runs together.  I ran UD strath 51 times before animated chain neck dropped.  12% drop rate, wtf.
---
No issue on alliance grouping with friends. Pros of instant queues. Sucks to be horde i guess
---
I think group queueing would remove this as a possibility.
---
But I Think if you group queue, you can't report afk someone to force them out of a bg would be acceptable.
---
Yeah, it sucks that it takes a lot of runs, but at least they are short and usually chain runs together.  I ran UD strath 51 times before animated chain neck dropped.  12% drop rate, wtf.
---
I agree and disagree.  It's easy to be pressured into playing the second way, and once you start it's really hard to go back to the first way, even with conscious effort.
---
I had a twink 19 WSG game last 2 hours and 27 minutes last night... One of the longest WSG games I've had so far... Haven't grinded AV on my main yet
---
No battlegroups this time around.  Everyone in the region queues together (so all the Americas realms are together, all the EU realms are together).
---
Yes you chose the ez mode faction for pvp. The 60-40 imba was always going to come with bg queues
---
"powershifting" gets its name from the fact that using the furor talent and the wolfshead helm a druid can instantly gain 20 rage or 60 energy without triggering a GCD. This is what makes feral DPS viable.
---
(Not really responding to your comment, just building off of it incase some newbies are reading and wondering why that would be called powershifting)
---
At least one BiS item that stays relevant the whole expansion. A good way to keep all raids active.
---
I would 100% expect private servers to be better people than classic. You had to be real into wow vanilla to get into the private server scene.
---
if i can only manage to get 40k honor per day will i ever reach rank 10? my guildies are hitting 200k honor+ a day
---
can you explain this more? what makes AB superior to AV?
---
Need more of this.
---
\*attack on titan music\*
---
If alliance wipe their Drek zerg and we back cap our GYs we can win. Its about 1 in every 15 games from what I've seen
---
It's mostly just the low ranks, if you pvp heavy your first weeks you'll skip 1/2/3 sometimes.
---
Well, they deserve to be reported for the stupid pet name, bot or not.
---
Diablo 3 didn't have skill points or trees, it just had things unlock and limited how many you could use at a time. 
---
Same basic idea without the meaningless talent inputs that retail has.
---
Tight
---
Depends on how many Shamans your raid has.
---
1? It probably goes to tank group for increased threat and tank heal spec focused. - priests are the raid healers instead.
---
4? The melee groups get WF. - these are probably all chain heal spec focused.
---
6+? The Warlock group gets reduced threat, the priest group gets mana spring. These usually spec deep resto to flex tank and raid heal since they don't need WF improved.
---
I think the worst town was the Draeni one
---
I mean, technically they are.
---
Random luck though...I'm sitting at 75% success with regular cables and about to upgrade to XL. I bet my luck turns now...
---
I am relaxed lol. I just love seeing people get salty at horde killing them yet the alliance have been doing the exact same thing.
---
We can see rogue :P
---
Does this work if youre tanking the NPC?
---
I would prefer to be horde to be honest. BUT my wife want to be a paly, and instant queue in WSG kinda seal the deal.
---
You right, was on mobile at work so was off the top of my head.
---
I have always played alliance, and I still have the ask the guard where things are in Darnassus because I rarely go there.
---
Yeah...fury Rogue
---
Never thought it that way but i guess you are right.
---
This made me think of grabbing a shovel and heading into the woods. It has all those features.
---
Right with you. Players would rather lose the game than play a non-pve av.
---
Mining and farming the highest value mobs while leveling and doing OK playing the AH.
---
I know that in later expansions of the game, the original un-modified game actually has a tracker somewhere in the menu. Not sure if it's the same for Vanilla/Classic. But DBM still tracks your kills
---
I still dont have it on my rogue but my meme spec shaman alt got it on my second run.
---
&gt;I'm  Just stating it's gone.
---
&gt;  Sadly it appears that this method of snapshotting has now been patched
---
Yeah what a jerk! Actually wanting to play efficiently rather than a braindead turtle game. Unbelievable!
---
I am thinking about dropping either ench or alchemy in favor of eng for my warrior. Both have some rare recepues but nothing crazy. What to drop?
---
Translation: 'I'm an asshole and struggle with social etiquette.'
---
I have a couple of pvp orientated questions. Are there spells that other classes can use to pop you out of bear/cat form?  Also do you swap weapons when you are in feral and switch to caster form? If so does anyone have a macro they like to use? Do you try and tie it into an ability or keep it separate?
---
So I spend two days doings bgs and I'm an animal, meanwhile your dumbass spent how many days leveling multiple warriors in vanilla? Hahaha okay, you win :)
---
**Fun Fact, at the top end, Moonkin is the only optimal druid spec.**
---
 
---
Hots being banned because of buff slot issue and ferals sub-optimal dps makes Boomkin the goto for the 1 druid slot.
---
Yeah I’m with ya I got invested with a premade group and even ran it some today. I was exalted yesterday and have won 85% of my games averaging 3k honor in 9-13 mins. I like it.
---
Your thinking too much m9-1
---
Looks like that place on the coast with spire on desolace
---
Having 75% success with cables, then 0% with cables XL is pure Classic.
---
surprisingly for some people length does not equal quality
---
&gt; the atrocities of P2 
---
probably this lmao
---
Still a lot of people leveling alts and going through for their first time, never too late. Pick a medium pop if you dont have time to wait in queues, I made the mistake of going to a full/high pop first and had to reroll at 35 after not wanting to wait in a 2-3+ hour queue every night. PvP servers arent as much of a struggle anymore but if getting ganked or camped isnt your thing definitely pick a PvE server and you can always queue for BGs if you get the itch to kill the other faction.
---
$15 for 1month trial sounds like a good deal. Try it out
---
Your moonkin gives away his innervate?
---
It's BiS for many situations. Typically most hardcore players will get them on most classes. They're excellent for flag carrying or if you're getting hit rapidly by a rogue. If you can afford them and are really serious about PvP, it's definitely worth getting 2x freezing bands on any melee class.
---
Druid was easily the best raid healing class in late WotLK because their kit at the time perfectly synced up with the damage patterns a lot of bosses had. Multiple fights with constant ticking aura damage (Lana'thel, Festergut, Sindragosa) meant that blanket rejuv with wild growth on cooldown output insane HPS with just two buttons. Good Druids knew how to use the rest of their kit as well, but I could easily see someone drunk top meters in a WotLK resto druid.
---
But that was 2 xpacs later and the class had been changed an enormous deal for the later.
---
In AV today, there are plenty of people who are unorganized and bad at the game.
---
Lots of ppl leveling alts rn. research the realm you plan to join before starting your new toon.. dont get stuck in a pvp realm with 80:20 ratio.. other than that, you should be fine. Lots of active ppl right now with battlegrounds coming back
---
Sounds like a you problem.
---
Blackhand’s Breadth from quest to kill Rend. Also if you haven’t done it yet, hinterlands elite quests gives Rune of the Guard Captain. That will serve you well until you get your HoJ
---
Grobmob reppin
---
Would you recommend a PvP or a PvE server for a first time classic player? I didn't really get the aspect of PvP in  retail but to be frank I'm a little nervous that I'm just gonna get ganked 24/7
---
Yes, though obviously not as quickly as they do.  Remember, a large percentage of players don't PvP, and you're being compared to all of them.
---
2% drop rate so after 38 or so runs it’s a coin toss as to whether or not you’ve seen it. Personally I got mine on a roll off on my 18th kill, only my 7th dedicated run really. But 38 runs is the 50/50 point.
---
What's wrong with kicking griefers?
---
If everyone wants that player gone how is it bad, explain.
---
&gt;Personally, I've tried many different ways to get in with just one friend that has seen a 0% success rate 
---
Yikes.
---
We can get 20 guild members into the same AV at least 90% of the time. I played close to 50 matches yesterday and I think I only missed 2 or 3 queues?
---
Kurinaxx is where i play. Its a high pop sometimes i never check but the server is where i like it.
---
Both factions control major points. For example going into ony yesterday it was first horde controlled then 2 alliance guilds happen to show up and take it over!  
---
Lots of tug of war like this not ever really controlled by 1 faction for too long. 
---
Also iv never had a que to login which is great!
---
Thanks for the tips! any places where i could do research on my ideal server?
---
Got it in my 3rd run :D
---
I'm completely new to vanilla and I started on a PvP server, honestly after bgs came out there won't be much ganking
---
I think this is the first split we did: https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/WzFp2gMA6R1QmbY9
---
Here you have logs for our guild in general: https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/guild/eu/razorgore/smile
---
They win quite a few. They adapt much quicker than the alliance do. Today has been a shitshow of people trying to use Tuesday strats against the modern horde strats.
---
I go deep in the sub tree for PvP.
---
What's the strat on horde side?
---
I'm on run 201 still haven't even seen the fucking thing
---
You're starting late and levelling slow, so it's not likely that you're going to find a guild that still needs a tank. However, you would be much further behind as a warrior wearing pre-bis than as a druid. I mean, most druids carry around a level 40 helm. 
---
Druid shines in 5-man content. I'm on a lot of people's friends lists and get constant requests to run dungeons (and not just as tank!). I assume it's because every other dungeon there's an "oh shit" moment and the only reason that we don't wipe is that I popped out to battle rez/innervate/switch to tanking. People will say "wow, good job" and you will feel like a goddamn superhero. 
---
As for what to level with your druid? Druid duo's are insanely powerful. You won't be slowed down, you can both stealth past content that you don't want to face, and you can take on content that is way above your level. But the real reason to go druid/druid is that the night elves start in the ass end of nowhere, and the druid quests all assume you're staying there. I mean paladins and druid's can't really level together until 10+ because one of you won't have a trainer. Even if she goes priest it's a long way to join up with you (I mean she could be a night elf priest but.... Why? I know you're not min-maxing but... It's just so, so much worse than the alternative). 
---
So yeah, I would recommend a druid duo. As an added bonus, it will be really easy to help her as she's learning because you'll be hitting the same milestones at the same time.
---
Small things amuse small minds
---
is there a fix or something?
---
He means you'd have shaman in warlock groups dropping tranquil air instead of warrior/rogue groups dropping windfury.
---
I got it working. Exe file was changed so go into game activity and select world of warcraft again.
---
So phase 3 is BWL, AV, WSG &amp; Darkmoon Faire. That was documented by blizzard originally. The BG's are released early though. 
---
Does that mean we are already in phase 3 then? No, of course not. If we only have a few aspects of phase 3, we are not in phase 3 yet. Therefor it is more logical to consider this being pre phase 3, but post phase 2. Thats the reason people are calling it phase 2.5.
---
Nah im just poor n the monitor was like $10 at goodwill lol
---
Since alliance has the advantage in a rush (less distance to cover) horde has been basically just accepting defeat while farming lieutenant/captain NPCs for Honor while waiting for alliance to win
---
Oh that’s cool! Where do I find the boss log?? I’ve run BRD anger since 52 almost 57 not seen it drop yet and a total of 3 Gorosh spawns 0 sgc
---
The solution to your problem is more druids
---
Horde will defend this
---
Shouldve mentioned US, playtime is usually 9pm-12 midnight(sometimes till 2am). I've heard good things about grob but the 7 min queue scares me that itll get worse as people would probably transfer or reroll over to make things worse.
---
Hey listen,
---
Not only is he a hero for getting the bot stability damage, but that STRONGHOLD soundtrack music is what made it for me. 
---
Good on you lad.
---
Awesome! thanks for the tip!
---
9pm MST* 
---
Brain not working right tonight
---
Her gear should be fine. The event is no joke, make sure she goes in prepared. That said, there are plenty of guides to help her know what to expect. Stay calm and she should do just fine.
---
Personally, my top three things to remember are 
---
1) Renew is your MVP. Keeping the peasants from hitting 30% and needing a heal all at once is crucial for both time and mana management.
---
2) Don't underestimate the damage of the skeletons. They have low HP, but past 2 or 3 of them you could get in trouble quickly.
---
3) Stay calm. The event is only about 5 minutes long and if you can settle into a rhythm it will be over before you know it.
---
Good luck!
---
Ironfoe isn't good though. Dal'rends or rivenspike+bone slicing hatchet are both better than ironfoe. The procrate is actual garbage.
---
cool name, why the fuck would you waste it on a botted toon
---
You can reach as many ranks as you earn in rank points. You can actually reach rank 4 in one week from unranked if you hit the top tier.
---
It takes 5k rank points to hit rank 3, then it increases by 5k each rank from there(4-10k, 5-15k, etc)
---
I hope the power creep difference changes. Like LFR to Mythic is a significant difference.. then the very next tier you can get previous mythic raid ilvl gear from world quests and dungeons. 
---
I know catchup needs to happen at some point but in BFA (and Legion though little less degree) it was super extreme. I’d prefer catchup in X.2, meaning for BFA it would be Uldir -&gt; BfDA from X.0 to X.1, then BfDA + catchup gear (badges? small raid? w/e) + EP in X.2. Uldir would still be lost unless they added some cool shit like MC’s Thunderfury and niche BiS like Onslaught Girdle, Mageblade etc. but the ilvl inflation prevents it currently
---
Classic leveling is not more difficult, it only takes longer.
---
Ive got Windows 7, how do i find the same settings?
---
The main difference between the first image and the second, is individuality.
---
In the second image, the player is assumed to be just another member of a networked crowd.  Everyone follows what the wiki says, and people only care about anything relative to either its' value on the Auction House, (where it will either be bought or not by someone else) or whether it will assist the player in competing with others.
---
Theran Fireweaver is the name of a single person.  "ROFLFACE" is a collective pseudonym which says nothing about the player using it at all; you might as well have given them a numerical bar code.
---
In the first image, the player is a distinct human being, who is exploring an environment on their own, and whose decisions are in no way related to anyone else.  In the second image, the player is nothing but a single drop in a gigantic, postmodern, Marxist bucket.
---
Nice
---
The AV you see in classic today is considered a nerfed version of 1.5 and 1.8.
---
Try out ironman. It's less about getting the best gp/xp per hour and more about tons of goals and milestones. Really changes the way you play the game. It's still a grind, a longer grind even, but when you have to be self sufficient it changes the way you play and makes almost all content relevant.
---
Everyone is doing 50k+ honor per day since AV released.
---
So yes, it is relative to what the other people on your server are getting.
---
Lol 40v40 stalling and oneshotting isnt actually pvp, its torture
---
Go wsg for pvp but I bet you dont want that.
---
Aww that's beautiful
---
Highest AV was 10min 
---
and WS was at 18min max for what I've seen
---
Y?
---
If they didn't kick me when I capped Snowfall they never will.
---
WSG currently is not better honor, given queues and the need to absolutely stomp the opposition.
---
It CAN be more honor if you get instant queues and again, absolutely stomp it...but right now that's not real.
---
we're buying 60-80 water for 1-2g usually in /2 before leaving the city ove rhere
---
u forgot parry, block, not enough rage, can't do that while stunned, target is too far away, ability is not ready yet. 😂
---
Great idea, then you can need on everything twice.
---
Who wants a druid healer anyways? MotW bot providing boomkin buff is more valuable.
---
I m a clicker too and do better than 90% of the people in BG
---
The one on the bottom right is PallyPower and the one that makes the buffs into under the map is part of a modpack called CTMods
---
Fixing a broken game mechanic and banning a user are two completely different things.
---
It's easy if you have friends that also play, I have mates that definitely aren't enjoying the game as much as they could be, often times at all, because they felt the need to keep up with the handful of us that wanted an ony and rag clear before it'd been a month.
---
We insisted not to, and some of them slowed down towards the end of the push but for some of them being part of that initial rush on new release content is a major incentive for doing things that aren't necessarily fun for them. 
---
Basically just FOMO.
---
No, you're spot-on.

\#PROTIPS
---
About the force druid out of form question: not that I know of, but polymorph kinda do that. But the opposite. You get sheeped in casterform and ”have” to shift into something else.
---
I used to have a macro for it. Tied it to the morph itself. It worked most of the time but sometimes, maybe cause of lag?, it switched weapon before form and gave me a gcd before shift. And that sucked and made my timing all wrong.
---
I reckon a five or so mage combo sappers could make good hph if they were horde atm, doing that to alliance as the queues are 20m+, so you have time to do it midqueue
---
Oh wow, I dont care.
---
You’re correct
---
Downranking means using a lower rank version of a spell. With +healing gear, lower ranked heals means more mana efficiency until a certain rank. 
---
You will find lower rank versions of your spells in your spellbook. (Keybound to "P" by default.)
---
&gt; Diablo 3 didn't have skill points or trees
---
Oh I know. Diablo 2 did. It’s a change they made in Diablo 3 that I did not care for very much.
---
K bye.
---
Well done
---
I was wondering when the "I'm quitting" posts were going to show up.
---
Don’t use tier one in PvE it’s bad for healing.
---
Does your guild do healing assignments?
---
?
---
thats not an acceptable answer. 
---
pvp is what brought me back to wow classic. i dont want to do "other things" so that i can play with my friends. who are you to say i shouldnt want to pvp with people i knew versus a bunch of strangers that are impossible to know because i wont see them again.
---
idk if youre alliance or what, but its not feasible to get into AVs with friends, there are too many, its impossible to get a group together.
---
Not sure if you're referring to WotLK in terms of size, or size + points. I find that vanilla is better in terms of motivating hybrid specs. WotLK had trees that went 20 points deeper, while only giving you 20 more points compared to vanilla. If you went something like 31/20/0 in vanilla, you could still only go 51/20/0 in WotLK. Even with the extra points, the best stuff was too far down IMO.
---
Ideally, you split the zerg at balinda, and don’t cap sh gy, mages and hunters can massively slow them.
---
class identity. i legit feel like every class in retail is just the same
---
I just report all bots, horde or alliance.
---
It's really the only thing we can do in the long run.
---
But in the short run, they make good bits of honor.
---
Feels like horde wins most now
---
Whats your gear?
---
Druids are great in WPvP.
---
You crazy.
---
Every week you get rank points depending on how much honor you got relative to the other players. Your total rankooints is your rank, Rank points decay every week with like 20% or smth.
---
Im drunk pls formgiven spelling
---
I’m at 14 wins in a row as horde at the moment. Now if only the queue times didn’t suck
---
Yeah I didn't touch upon that. Given financial reality, Classic+ is little more than pipe dream at this point, no doubt. 
---
That said, a part of me can't help but want it, but yeah.... it really doesn't seem likely.
---
Swiftmend is a core PvP ability for high pressure small group fights. That said, if you're willing to give up moonglow, there's no reason to push past natural shifter and then grab feral charge for the 8/11/32 build. Swiftmend is Mana intensive, sure, but you can drink in PvP. I haven't had many Mana problems even when spamming Swiftmend on CD (Being a NE is the superior druid for PvP, as you can drink+meld for a few ticks).
---
I personally run 8/11/32, which IMO is the best PvP spec.
---
What is your goal? If you want 1v1s or PvE combat, moonglow is far superior.
---
Anything PvP that is more than 1v1, go 8/11/32.
---
Preparation means having a second rogue jump out, right?
---
As a player based on Mankrik, im disappointed that all US realms are connected.
---
because we have a life and can maybe play about 8-10 hours a week ?
---
I have no idea what you even just said. But true pvpers want to pvp and have fun while getting comparable honor (was usually better) than people solo queing av
---
Imagine SL with heals 😬
---
Ah, I literally had that *exact* group on Herod except the priests level
---
reeeeeeee
---
Yeah, it's horrible.
---
I use recount. Bagnon. Atlasloot. Leatrix maps. And that's rly it tbh. No action bar changers. No spell time showers or debuts and all that. I can't even see how much hp certain targets have. Lol. I feel gimped but I've always raided this way.
---
I'm not a pro, at all. But I did pretty damn good back in tbc days. Had a high arena rating and did all the raiding content. 
---
But right now I don't have insane gear. So il need a threat meter soon when my gear gets better but some fights threat is dropped and you kinda need it regardless. 
---
I want some addons that change things but not too bad u know. A more organized style of playing maybe not necessarily a super min maxxer addon
---
I think you may be underestimating the amount of AV premades the Horde are already facing. Hiding in plain sight behind multi-realm groups.
---
I have and it was/is awful.
---
The addon “classicpremade” one word.  Makes it very easy to AV que big groups.   Not 100% but very nice.
---
I mean right no if you solo wsg you are more than likely going to face a premade. I did 12 today and it was full premade WSGs. Regardless of how the AV is, that wouldn’t change. If people could stay competitive in WSG far more people would do it
---
Tbh a lot of my friends went back to SWTOR with me and its been a blast.
---
...why would you?
---
I kind of hate it too though. It's not fun, but if you dont do it you fall way behind in ranking 😕 kinda sucks. Wish it was skill based like rated battlegrounds
---
Who's winning the match, Pop?
---
Absolutely! Hell, if WSG was even close to AV I think you would see a decent sized shift
---
I play on Herod which is one of the more populated servers and rarely see queues there anymore. I wouldn't worry too much about that, it's likely the playerbase will continue to slowly drop across the board.
---
Imagine being Alliance on Flamelash O.o
---
The biggest thing right now is ally rushing to farm rep.  Once they max out or realize it's easy rep anyway they'll slow down for more honor and the games will lengthen, in fact it's already been happening the last day or so.  Eventually a balance will be reached where pre-made WSG will compete with AV pugs.
---
Granted pre-made AV will probably still be better, but it's a bit harder to guarentee how many get in.
---
MC right now is bad for druids, as fights are so fast that the other others can spam flash heals for higher numbers than our HT, as the fights end before they go OOM.
---
Don't worth about meters now, the only way to be out of the dumpster is if the other healers are bad/have bad gear/your guild is really struggling with the fights.
---
Go regrowth spec if you really want to top meters now, but it's not until AQ that you'll start to push past priests and pallys.
---
Don't remind me from that server, but Priest+Lock was aids in the beggining.
---
No i can tell they are bots because of the way they move. How they just kind of freeze in place then either tab target and run towards whatever their target picks up or if tab doesnt pick up a target they return back to their scripted run path. 
---
If you watch someone for a few minutes you can usually tell if they are botting or not.
---
Saw an addon from a youtube video that would add 2 slots near your action bars that would let you switch trinkets even if dead with a simple left click for first slot trinket and right click for the second slot trinket.
---
Mend pet set?
---
One raid difficulty only, fewer drops per boss. People often talk about LFR and LFG being bad, which is true, but also the trivialisation of loot and identifiable accomplishment is just as critical.
---
100% &amp; you have so many bonus VS undead. Just make sure you put salvation on everyone
---
Frostbite.
---
you target the player and right click their portrait and select report.
---
All water is foreign water to someone.  Boom.
---
Reverting all the nerfs on AV would probably do it.
---
If your guild is planing to getting nightfall/annhilator when phase 3 drops you dont want to have additional Weapon debuffs on the Boss because They will push each other from the list. 
---
Right now? Go for it.
---
What is the add on across the top? That displays all info
---
It might not be the best honor farm, but I had a BLAST playing WSG last night. It was just myself (disc priest) and a super geared warrior with BRE. Sure, we got stomped by some premades, but we at least managed to clap a few of their players every fight.
---
Druids actually get stronger as healers as classic goes on, in PvE and especially for PvP.
---
As the meta shifts to higher numbers, priests get far less tanky and less able to nullify burst damage. Shamans will melt as they get dog piled with nothing to stop others, and paladins get obliterated outside of their bubble.
---
Druid mobility gets more valuable as the game goes on, as you can get away and heal to full very quickly
---
I can confirm, procs quite a lot, sometime one proc on top of another. Feels good.
---
I support this
---
Why, they don’t even have to heal me cuz I kill everything so fast
---
You must gather your party before venturing forth.
---
I know there are different classifications but I’d rather gouge my own eyes out than read your first comment again.
---
At least they would be forming a PvP group and not grinding to rank 14 solo queing. 
---
When I did the grind in  vanilla we got tons of solo pug groups. It wasn’t cross realm BGs so we were known to the point where they would sit in their base and we would cap all 3, not kill them and move on. I could see that being frustrating, but we were organized and are rewarded for building a team and actually pvping. Having the “Power” to actually do battlegrounds, face other premades and control brackets at high ranks, because we worked hard to do that.
---
Now you don’t need any kind of pvp background, experience, community or team effort to grind to rank 14. Just run up a road for hours upon hours and kill some NPCs to get max honor
---
Big trap damage set
---
When asked why he wouldn't help the team, he said "I have better things to do than play with you shitters" and tabbed out for the rest of the game while we lost. This is one of the most influential Classic players.
---
The only people that actually need to farm AV are the NEETs that are going after rank 14.
---
If you aren't going after rank 14, nothing in the game is forcing you into AV.
---
haha fair, only my second go round so it's different for me
---
Haha you're totally fucking right
---
Dodged executes as 2hand fury are my fav.  Such a waste of rage lol.
---
Mage + Paladin
---
Blink + Bubble, then fry an entire raid with mage AOEs with double talent points.
---
I miss it too
---
Didn’t say wsg needs a buff, AV needs to be nerfed tho. I want r10+ and am currently r5. I have 130k honor this week and am worried about dropping rank because I don’t do enough AV it’s a stupid meta.
---
I just hit 60 on my priest alt. You really make it look easy and I can't wait to try to get good at pvp on my priest.
---
It's a complicated system, but boiled down, you kill someone and they give you honor.
---
At the end of the week, they make a list of who got the most honor, say you're #20 on the server for the week, meaning 19 people got higher honor than you.
---
You get ranking points based on what position on the server you were. Those ranking points go toward your overall ranking points, and you need a certain amount to get to the next rank.
---
At low ranks, if you get a high honor position for the server for the week, it's possible to go to the next rank, and it's even possible to skip a rank and go up two.
---
The downside to this, is at the end of the week, everyone also loses something like 10% of their total ranking points, so the higher rank you are, the higher position for the week you need to have, or you can actually LOSE ranking points and go down in ranks. That's why getting to the highest rank (14) is so hard, because you might gain 2000 ranking points, but lose 1800 to the weekly decay, only actually gaining 200 ranking points. (don't know tve actual numbers, just an example)
---
Actually Horde got the advantage, people are just not using the backdoor jump and instead pull 1 billion adds running over the bridge.
---
the wow classic/tbc/wotlk talents and spells
---
... it doesn't matter. You're still saying WSG needs to be the most efficient. It's the same, and it's irrelevant for people that aren't chasing 14.
---
Don't conflate true pvpers with r14 chasers.
---
clearly the best card in mtg, anyone who disagrees is trolling
---
fuck that, nerf AV honor so "r14 chasers" have to do something for it.
---
it gives way too much honor and makes everything else irrelevant.
---
they have heavily incentivized a single player experience in an mmo
---
  Blizzard really should have put a difficulty rating on classes.  Say.. a 1-5 scale where 5 is expert, 1 is button masher.  
---
   
---
1 Warlocks.  You can level to 60 naked with no gear equipped, casting corruption, affliction, sending Voidwalker to attack and auto wanding.  Talents? Who cares.  
---
5 Warriors.  Highly gear dependent.  Your skill bar is full of stuff and you’ll use most of it.  If you tank your skill bar now resembles a 747 cockpit and you need an encyclopedic memory of dungeon layout and fight mechanics for everything.
---
Lol. K
---
I’m confused are you upset that retribution is as shitty as people have been saying it always was?
---
ZF graveyard farming. My mage is almost high to start doing it and the sgameplay appeal to me. Is it really as good as the guides say it is? I would have to respect out of imp blizz into imp CoC. I’m guessing it wouldn’t work with blizz since you’d go oom before the pack dies right? Anyone have any experience they can share? How fast did you level? How much gold did you make?
---
And that's why you NEVER bring an alt to a dungeon you need a specific thing that hasn't dropped for your other character.
---
... except r14 chasers are doing AV premades
---
Well, please share your brilliant strategies tho, since you sound so knowledgeable. And this is a Zerg rush thread, so I only talk about Zerg rush. Say what you want, but I am the one who spend time writing this a lot.
---
You do know there are more ranks than just 14, right?
---
What shirt-related troubles? What happened?
---
It's a 1/20 drop chance, but my experience was closer to 1/60. Random is random, and I've talked to people who have seen it 5 out of 7 runs on a mage or warlock.
---
So much this. Starfire skull, moonfire X at the exact same time, shift, roar, and start tabbing. If something breaks away you have growl and stun.
---
Honestly, druid is just better at tanking 5-mans. Their main issue in raids (not being able to avoid crits) isn't that big a deal in 5-mans.
---
I crai everytaim
---
I haven’t been killed questing in wpl and burning steppes from 56-60
---
Is that a mageblade?
---
do you understand the words i typed?
---
r14 chasers are doing av because it offers way too much fucking honor
---
As Horde It took me about 16h first day for 21k rep (20% win short matches)  and about 14h 2nd day (30%win longer matches)
---
:(
---
Wsg in my experience is unplayable for solo players or even groups of 3-4 its unplayable. Ive played maybe 10-12 games of wsg and i had 1 game where the enemies werent 10 premades
---
Can still be #NoChanges if they give us the pre nerfed AV
---
This guy AV's
---
Feral DPS feels like you're Clark Kent and then shit hits the fan and suddenly you're fucking superman and everyone is super stoked that you showed up.
---
The land mines were tilting af though.
---
Why do you believe True PvPers don't care about their PvP rank at all?
---
Both pick a instance and queue for it. Only join if it pops for both of you.
---
Sweet revenge.
---
Do you?
---
&gt;they have heavily incentivized a single player experience in an mmo
---
remember that time I said 
---
&gt;except r14 chasers are doing AV premades.
---
you know, to refute your point about being a single player? The most efficient honor gains are still doing AV with a premade. If you're playing solo AV you're still getting fucked by turtle matches 50% of the time.
---
Until the OP clarifies how long the battle actually was.  I'm gonna a dragged out 1 hour alliance turtle game.
---
Yessir it is.
---
That’s 68k honor an hour
---
So why?
---
Trivialization of loot is the biggest problem imo. They shouldn't have made LFR for the next tier be as good as the previous raid. Also, the gear shouldn't be so exponential in power in retail. It should be clear that the next tier drops overall better gear, but it shouldn't be miles better. There should be some debate if a previous tier with set bonuses is better than the individual pieces of the next tier.
---
Honestly I have a new appreciation of tanks and warriors in general now that I'm leveling one. Feels good tanking but man when I'm solo and I miss 3x in a row with my 3.8 axe I cry
---
Any idea what the highest plus healing would be with bis blues/epics? Our guild generally has paladins main tank heal on bosses. I’m usually raid healing.
---
How does the American Airlines thing work? Every server I've been on there's someone spamming that they can summon people for like 2-3g around the map. I used the service once for 3g to get to SM. dude invited me to a raid and a bunch of logins/log offs happened and they summoned me. Kinda crazy.
---
while spamming this macro, 99% of the time you are not attack. So if you got crit you gain 1 reckoning instead of reset you melee. But then you give it up by spamming stopattack, which means you give it up. And finally you won't benefit form reckoning at all.  
---
The other problem is: even if you only press this macro when your swing is ready and you do have reckoning stacks, you still lose them because you cancel your attack before reckoning actually pop up.  
---
The correct way to make full use of reckoning is: stopattacking until you swing is ready, then attack and wait for 0.5s to trigger your reckoning(if you have any), then stopattacking and wait. That is super annoying and I'd rather simply keep my auto on and take the reset swing.
---
Probably give the edit a read real quick.
---
why is that funny to you?
---
my logic is sound. 
---
you may not want to group with people but you have to recognize they have heavily incentivized playing alone in a game famous for its community
---
That’s reassuring. The boss fights end pretty quickly and I am rarely oom by the end of them.
---
a rat ate a few holes through the sleeves of one of his shirts and he continued to wear it, I would assume without even first washing it, but who really knows.
---
There is stuff like half DKP. Where if you take an item you lose half your DKP. This would prevent it.
---
Haha! So you admit it!
---
As long as there are horde, it will be a turtle game.
---
I’ll give it a go. Thanks.
---
Its fun
---
join the mage classic discord and go into the aoe leveling channel they can answer your questions
---
But it really isn't that big of a problem. I've rarely had it that people would collude with one another on this because there are like 5 people and all want that item. It is either one that drops very often and thus people take it, or it drops rarely and people will bid for it high anyway.
---
What do you want people to tell you? How to level up?... you know exactly what kind of XP you're getting in AV, and you know exactly what kind of XP you get outside of it.
---
Also, you're in a guild that farms MC but still needs an OT? On top of that, you're struggling to get a scholo group in a guild that farms MC and needs you at 60...something doesnt seem right.
---
I've literally never seen anyone right click the stealth buff to unstealth until now.
---
Ya, still a big yikes.
---
Imagine blaming anyone but him.
---
LMAO
---
You're* not
---
Well when you turn in all the quests and win normally 30 minutes your get 1400 rep..... So it's actually better then 10minute wins....
---
Lorti UI I think
---
I had a 1.5 hour the other night
---
So fun
---
Its not the greatest damage right now due to all the greens limiting my mana pool but in shorter fights it does great
---
If I told you why it's funny I'd probably get banned, so I'll pass.
---
12 hours in 4 days? Those are rookie numbers, son. People going for high rank are playing 12+ hours **per day**
---
Well you won't contribute a lot. But you should at least not be bad for the raid.
---
Those points don't exist, which is my entire point. You can't say "308 isn't worth it" for some cases, because for those specific cases, it's just simply unreachable, meaning it isn't even worth talking about/considering.
---
so you have no argument then. got it.
---
At what point do you just not bother farming it? It's not like you need every single BiS to start raiding...
---
Aww man, you're no fun at all. Attention spans are short these days...
---
I think you don't quite grasp how much the 20% RP decay will cause you to taper off. You will NOT be able to rank indefinitely unless you can begin to dedicate 50+hrs/wk.  You will quickly hit that wall and realize that 90% of people will just pvp in whatever BG they enjoy the most.
---
Arcane shot
---
Apes are in a 2+ hour game atm.
---
Doing this on stream is so shameless and honestly warrants a ban
---
This is so true . You start to actually contemplate if you can finish off the damn mob. Then that fight or flight instinct kicks in.
---
\&gt; Charges Mage  
---
\&gt; Gets Frost Nova'd  
---
\&gt; Guess I'll die
---
Don't forget the one where someone pulls the entire room instead of just two marshalls.
---
probably should add then:   
---
Levelling actually beeing levelling and not like the av rush farm, 30h and done.   
---
Most players got 6+days playtime until lv60
---
lol
---
okay and? still good at 1v1s
---
"I have a life" and "I don't have friends to play with" seems like two conflicting statements. You're definitely more of a no-life if you play WoW alone rather than with friends.
---
You’re right, just wanted feedback on how wasteful it would be to spend 59-60 in AV, think I’ll find some dungeons and then do AV after
---
I've gone in the opposite direction. Stopped worrying about going fast and being the best, just go at my own pace, explore the world, try to have an immersive roleplaying experience.
---
yup. its real funny that i like to play games with friends. in an mmo. haha what an idiot
---
Hey you big dumb adult infant BGs are out, guess you have nothing else to whine online about
---
I think 1% to miss is the lowest you can go.  Dodge and parry are probably the same.  Honestly if it's not a boss I'm fine with 5% to hit.  Saves doing some odd gear changes for low level stuff.
---
Pfff. Well
---
Class identity over spec identity. Talent trees and hybrid specs. Don't make everything you accomplished irrelevant they moment a new patch hits. Make crafting great again.
---
No - storm strike is an extra melee attack so it can proc WF but elemental focus only procs from a nature, frost, or fire spell.
---
So lame fury warriors get punished with BRD hell.
---
I got the chest after maybe 60 runs, but still no HOJ.
---
Arena runs feel better tho to recruit for.  Guildies need shards and sometimes casters want the belt.
---
HOJ you’re basically forcing helpers to come.
---
Shittiest server on EU with 90% non-fluently english speaking spanish people, nty rerolled from there insta 👍
---
You seem like you have some personal problems. Might wanna lighten up.
---
I hope you’re kidding
---
Shhh don't you know the horde doesn't like math?
---
I've tried pointing this out to a few people and they don't grasp the concept.   "But mah 2.5k honor in 8 min"
---
Bring 3 mages 1 priest and let them play for ya :)
---
 you 3v1 people but only when the servers are working good???? lol
---
Along that lines, single difficulty content. 
---
Maybe make the final boss of each tier single difficulty, then you can give him cool loot.
---
Yeah. I like the idea of having enough points to go pretty deep into two trees, but you can only reach the final talent in one tree.
---
What raid frames are you using? I also like how the tanks are at the top left, is that part of your raid frames?
---
6 mins for 800 honor, or 10 for 3k honor. You people drive me nuts, and you can't even spell.
---
Whats your class? I farmed 900g as a prot tank, so should be relatively easy for any other class
---
You’re not truly a warrior until you raid with full consumes and world buffs. Plays 10000% different.
---
Mob is green, the XP is clean
---
Mob is yellow, graveyard hello 
---
I'm only somewhat kidding
---
It’s all about timing, you can defend it with 5, because in early games, most horde are at Belinda and a few in base. Horde will not come back till they have  killed Belinda, which is about in 5-6 min game time. And then, some of them will come back and most of them will keep pushing. Why? If they all choose to come back, but the alliance is rushing Drek, they will lose the game at the moment they reach base. However I f you waste time holding FW GY, they can just come back and wipe you all. (Scenario b). 
---
You can still win some games because most of the horde will choose scenario c, which is a 50/50 PVE race.
---
How do we watch?
---
You don't know how ony works then.
---
It's not though.  There's no reason the horde can't win AV.  They just don't feel like doing it.  I blame all the people that want fast games.
---
That’s probably the most entertaining way to level a warrior. It takes a lot of patience and traveling to solo quest a warrior to 60.
---
It's insane how much better the Alliance who stayed on my realm are than the Alliance on most transfer and PvE realms. I think it's more that confident PvP'ers stayed rather than average players forged their skill in the hellscape of Skeram Alliance, but I'm impressed with them either way.
---
What do you like doing?
---
There is plenty of content, and the game doesn't start at 60. There are things to do, but most of the content is getting there. Dungeons/quests/zones.
---
hey, whoa, fuck you, buddy.
---
AV is my favorite part of WoW, but the higher the level, the less fun I have with it. 
---
How about:
---
Main Group - Straight to Galv then on to Drek.  This group should set off the towers on the way(leaving guards—especially those with stealth, to make sure they burn).
---
Smaller Group - Take the first mine.  And then they should reclaim Alliance towers, and take the second mine on their way to meet up with the main group.
---
Graveyards - Don’t claim mid-field graveyards.  Focus on claiming the graveyard closest to Drek, but you also need to let the Horde take graveyards further from Drek.  Graveyards can be a tough balance for inexperienced players or groups that don’t communicate well.  On the one hand, you need the Horde to respawn further way from your goal of Drek, but by getting them to do that, they are respawning closer to their goal.  Now you’re battling the Horde and the clock.
---
As soon as the last two towers burn, everyone rushes Drek.
---
A lot of the battleground quests and turn-ins are cool, but they never really seem worth it.
---
I firmly believe we have the best server
---
did what i type make sense? l ike i can jump into a group of 5 hordes as a warrior and pop off before i die because my abilities feel like they actually work compared until earlier in the day. idk its weird
---
lol honor
---
Enjoyed the editing and music choices, but the gameplay was ResidentSleeper.
---
lmao
---
I need an **I WIN "MACRO"** for my Worgan **Unholy Death Knight**, Can anyone help me? Pretty Please?
---
lol i basically only run things with guildies now and they always give me way too much, like 80 at a time
---
That is how it was way the fuck back in the day when alterac valley lasted the entire day, lol.
---
&gt;AFK’d the entire fight
---
&gt;popped 1 ability
---
&gt;top DPS
---
Something is amiss in your story bubba
---
beautiful, it looked like the mass loggins from sorcers in tibia
---
&gt;not wanting to purposefully gimp yourself = "NO FUN ALLOWED"
---
You could introduce a mechanic that makes old raids useful the first X times you run them. That way, a new player would still want to run uldir, but vets could skip it.
---
Same order as a feral druid.
---
Omen of Clarity Proc :D
---
Shred :)

Miss &gt;:|
---
100%. PvE servers would have very long Alliance queues and PvP servers would have very long Horde queues. Pretty counter-intuitive when you can just merge the two and eliminate queues entirely for one side and mostly for the other.
---
How you can hold if the mail expire in 24 hrs??
---
Fuck the alliance. Hurry up with your Zerg already and win. That 8 minutes queue time isn’t going to start itself.
---
Good luck finding people that will purposefully make MC take longer just so that a couple people can fuck around and play garbage specs.
---
So how exactly did you get the mageblade though? Can’t imagine anyone with master loot on giving it to a hunter. Just curious.
---
No it's not. This is the nerfed AV that never should have launched.
---
Warlocks have way more buttons and abilities than warriors.
---
Your story is inaccurate, MC attunement requires level 55 to get the quest.
---
okay but you could do 6 av in those 40 minutes and get 6 times the rep
---
Hi player who never played in Vanilla. STFU please.
---
83 for me..
---
Great gameplay honestly 2400 rated content
---
Right on. Thanks!
---
are you daft? you are lvl 48. you dont play AV. so you dont matter in this discussion
---
You could add warriors never taunting elites off clothies
---
what did people expect idk... the game is a box of bugs.
---
Sometimes my mouse will trick me into thinking I've been distracted; but I noticed it was happening while in combat (can't distract someone who's in combat). I have a rival 310 and I've never had issues with it doing this, to include games that require much more intense flick movements and fast mouse tracking. I'm convinced it's something to do with the game itself. It doesn't seem to be a hardware-sensor or driver issue as this only happens in wow.
---
Its easily the best warrior trinket,  i didn't replace mine till level 70 the first time around.
---
The fact that auto attacking in WoW is a toggle was the weirdest thing to me. It was fine getting used to it on my caster but then I wanted to level a warrior alt and I just can't stand it. I always have a "is this thing on" moment when I start fighting a mob.
---
how about some video proof instead of a screenshot when you call someone out like that
---
like this could literally just be a screenshot of him typing in chat for 1 second, and you all believe the title
---
With 5 votes he could be kicked out for afk

Yr character looks like the most paladinny paladin to ever paladin. Hell yea.

if they kept the way AV originally was, it would have been. they decided on the nerfed version because everyone would be undergeared for it and totally not be able pug clear T1 by the time AV came out or anything.
---

I would have NOT put in the horrible maze in the Wailing Caverns. Yeah. I was the guy who did that. They wanted it bigger, and it was the only way I could think of increasing the size (I was out of cave ideas).

Nah, I was super-excited to find sweet loot, to tell you the truth. It felt like a game to me on live servers...a very familiar game, but a still, a game. ;)

Other than plate, every loot is hunter loot

Wildhammer reputation, huh.

They actually kept those reputations active for the phases on Classic?
---
*laughs in Alliance*  
---
So how's Phase 2 treating you
---
Thanks!
---
Your memory of such has nothing to do w/ his, just because you can find enjoyment out of smashing two rocks together not everyone can or will. If you loathe the way someone enjoys a game then you legit have mental issues you should sort out with someone.
---
Ive done around 100k honor/day in AV accordibg to spy, but it seems kinda busted. Can i expect to push any decent rank at this pace?
---
Could be a lot of things. Various network issues either on blizzard's side during the peak hours, or your ISP having latency or loss issues during peak hours. It could be something totally different; you could be playing vs higher caliber players during peak time with more health, avoidance, better reactive cd usage etc. It's impossible to tell without observing.
---
We're talking about alive games.
---
DUDE AFTER LIKE 50 60 RUNS I GOT HOJ LAST NIGHT.
---
 Some shitty dagger dropped in arena I rolled need on for my offspec. The other rogue was like Bro ill pass on this but you have to pass on hoj if it drops. Told him sorry mate but if hoj drops I'm def needing so need on this dagger if you want it homie.
---
I'm one luky stubborn sob.
---
Thanks! I appreciate it...it's a shame they weren't shorter!  
---
;)
---
I would really only que av when I was mindlessly playing. Our group would join av in between ab and wsg ques. We had a group running probably 16 hours a day. We chose between wsg and ab based on the number of players we had. I personally enjoy AB the most 
---
Meta was not spam av. That was not good honor in comparison to premade groups. It is now r14 pve-av zergers
---
the guy is an absolute nutcase lol
---
Are you lost? /r classicwow is for complaining about the state of AV and PvP only.
---
Yup u can but 5ppl might report u and then its 15min deserter for you i think?
---
Yeah, funny how that happened. I totally lucked out there with classic becoming a thing.
---
Molten Helm + Corehound Boots if you don't already have them. Lava Belt will also be added with BWL but you can gather materials now.
---
Dragons in BWL will have fire damage breaths in addition to their physical attacks, so having fire resist gear with good stats is nice.
---
What are the specs on your monitor?
---
You all look like a bunch of dicks
---
No
---
Unless you live in Akron, Ohio, I think the chances are slim.  ;)  
---
I have those ridiculously expensive signed slip-case editions on Amazon. They're signed.
---
Sweet!
---
I knew where this was going once I realized where you were, and I was all for it.
---
Look up the benediction guide on wowhead icyveins. I recommend those oils of immolation for easy clearing of the skeletons. Also press shift v to turn on friendly nameplates so you can track health. 
---
If there’s another priest nearby on the quest, you can group up and start the quest together, you just can’t heal each other and one person needs to stand by the quest giver.
---
All in all, pretty easy quest if you come with the right consumables. Good luck!!!
---
I have no idea why this person gets this amount of attention.
---
Thanks, I was wondering why it wasn’t working.
---
RIP in peace. Heh
---
Depends on the damage meter you use, I use *Details!* nowadays but if I remember correctly Recount only displays the DPS from the damage you dealt during the time you dealt damage, if you pop 1 execute the last second the boss dies you'd absolutely have the highest dps
---
I think this is a real pretty one for chill gameplay.
---
The anti-streamer circle jerk is hilariously sad.  How does this affect you?
---
Kinda like.. religion. Or politics. Or music artists, or movie actresses. What people will do.. for a piece of someone popular's attention, even if brief.
---
This was me, I leveled from 53-60 from almost entirely BRD run(majority Arena/Anger). Thoughts were it was time to start grabbing my prepaid BiS gear, if I start at 53 trying to grab HoJ I'd get it and be able to move on to other gear and be geared by 60.
---
I have the track or tracker addon, telling you how many times you kill a mob... I killed Angerforge 88 times. I hit 60 probably around kill 65. When I got to 60 I gave up for awhile, then I had everything but HoJ and knew I needed to go back.. saw it drop four times within that 88 span, just unlucky rolls till that fourth time. And being melee DPS it's hard to find a group that would let you in because all the tanks try and form the groups with it reserved for them if it drops.
---
Only saw Gorosh 5 times during those many runs. Probably ran BRD close to 100 times. Never saw the fabled SGC... I dread going back to that place, even though now I'm basically fully geared with all but that chest piece
---
Tips sucks dick, like most wow classic streamers who hopped on the bandwagon for views
---
oh, this game took about an hour.  Lok broke the stalemate.
---
5% hit cap is at 315 weapon skill.
---
Yes but it is possible to enter MC at lvl 50.
---
I enjoy min-maxing and making my life more efficient. There’s something about playing suboptimal that doesn’t feel good. Maybe it’s something about my personality or whatever but being the middle of pack or not being as good as I can be feels awful. 
---
Though if playing suboptimal is more fun than play optimally, then the better choice will be playing a tiny bit worse. As an example, when I started playing classic wow I only did quests and tried to optimize a couple of things and that was fun for me. I would rather take it slow or whatever if it’s more fun, plus it’s not like there is a competition to reach max level.
---
Is there a difference between opening the gates and ringing the gong?
---
I guess they never miss, huh?
---
What realm does he play on? Wouldn't mind to gank the fucker
---
Leveling fury tank warrior here. Soloing is not fun and I die and get ganked so very much.
---
Man I love watching the PvP chads cry about PvP.  Who cares about vanilla PvP lmao.
---
hahahah yeah, hence why I had to edit it to much XD
---
Mine only shows FPS and dungeon portal entrances. 
---
I have questie also. No pally power. My recount is on always lol.
---
&lt;B\^) aye, bracket 1 ez clap
---
You can watch his vod and see it yourself. : )
---
You can still enter through the portal at level 50. You don’t need to do the attuned to enter MC.
---
Okay? Thats kinda implied given that there is no way I could have access to factual data to support that claim? 
---
Do you actually need people to add 3-4 different caveats to any statement they make?
---
your raid probably sucks and needs to drink every pull. 
---
sorry to say
---
designing zones that feel like actual places instead of an insect hive that's hell on earth to navigate without being able to fly
---
Well i try to make the best of the situation. If i queue in Alterac Mountains i go farm some mobs while waiting, can make 1-2g between bg's. If i queue in Orgrimmar i can often get to Azshara and pick a herb or two. So how's your income since bg's came out? :p
---
So basically legion legendarys
---
Using Vampiric Embrace generates a metric fuckton of threat and is usually enough to tip you over since you’re riding right below the tank with Mind Blast usage. 
---
Additionally, while Mind Flay does take up a debuff slot, it’s only for the slow. As such, it’s usually knocked off pretty quick while the dmg portion is left untouched. 
---
Source: 92% parsing SPriest
---
Some alliance human got it after 14h after release so ye pretty sure u could have made it in 1 day as alliance :p
---
Lol, go ahead and waste your time reporting then, idiot. Maybe I’ll report your reddit account for having a dumb fuckin name, too.
---
who touched you to make you this fucking salty
---
P sure u only need pallypower if yr a pally. Its just for making sure yr buffs are up on everyone. Since ret paladins lack in dps,  i feel like being able to buff up yr party is important so i like to make sure everyones got the buff they need/want on em at all times.
---
I'm a birdie you have to understand its not meant to grind honor but just to have fun dude
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAb9lQ0u1t8
---
Took me like 15 minutes, and I thought that was ridiculous
---
Most of those examples sadly yes. Doesnt make it right.
---
no briarwood reed 1/10 ?s
---
Well that's my point.  If you can get 308 without making huge sacrifices, it's good, otherwise, 305 is sufficient.
---
My very first class was a mage back in '04. Got tired of hitting frostbolt so I rerolled warrior.
---
Never really thought the class was "hard" but it sure as hell was more rewarding/fufilling. I felt like I was actually doing something. Since then, its the only class I have played. I now have an alliance warrior and a horde warrior.
---
He didnt call it a shameless run, he was bragging about him being top DPS though after killing Onyxia, knowing full well he AFK'd the entire fight. He mightve been being sarcastic but its hard to tell with someone like him I find, just me personally. He wasnt doing a run for the community, he was getting all the loot during the MC run. Literally saying stuff like him getting the BiS gear at lvl 53 or whatever lvl he was
---
Ony has finicky aggro so melee is encouraged to white hit phase 1 so when she lands in phase 3 they don't grab aggro and proceed to nuke the remainder of the right. Waiting until phase 3 isn't terrible play on ony.
---
how about the fact that no one runs north at the start of the game and everyone just piles into Bal.. at least on ally we had a few who run south to take GY instead of wasting time.
---
M E T H OMEGALUL  D
---
This, only instead of just charge, add it to all your offensive abilities.
---
There is so much misinformation in here, it is mind boggling.
---
I guess thats somewhat valid. It was pretty clear he was just AFKing it though. He wasnt with the group at all, just standing there next to ony
---
One sided ganks is what PvP is about. It's not supposed to be fair. That's the point of the element of surprise.
---
I play both frost mage and fury warrior.
---
But I must admit I *love* and I do mean ***LOVE*** messing with warriors on my frost mage.
---
Warrior attacks - frost nova
---
Warrior charges- blink
---
Blink on cooldown - Ice block
---
Ice blocks fades - blink
---
Warrior charges - frost nova.....blink....Slows warrior down with frost bolt....etc.....
---
But I also love playing my warrior. I'm not terrific at it because I'm kinda stupid. But there is something highly satisfying about melee.
---
Ive tanked/hosted 14 all orb res runs in the last month, all formed in &lt;=15 minutes since alot of folks need gear, but I got an average of 1.2 orbs per run, which is lower gold/hour than farming elementals solo, so I dont do it anymore, not worth my time. It may look lucrative when 5 orbs drop, but you need to consider that half the time no orbs drop, &gt;1 is rare in my experience, but maybe I was just unlucky in my 14 runs, idk.
---
Or as a rogue when they parry my riposte
---
No warlocks.
---
Doesn’t matter I got the epic
---
It's always worth it if you like it. Don't worry about the endgame. Enjoy the journey at your own phase.
---
Yeah what he said
---
Halo 3 and Overwatch are two games I could have legitimately gone “pro” if I wasn’t in Australia. 
---
Also the two games I poured most time into so it just seemed like something anyone could work towards.
---
The fact that battlegrounds have pve objectives is really silly
---
I think it's such a ridiculous thing he thought total dmg. I misunderstood and it didn't occur to me someone would point to their DPS in that situation
---
Perfect rogue tactics lol
---
You have to understand, these losers have never seen a world boss and never will. It's an alien feeling for them.
---
you'd like to think so, but wait til you need to get attuned for bwl.
---
The Vod is literally labeled “Shameless MC run”.
---
I have flameguard shoulders and guild is making me a molten helm and possibly the boots at some point
---
I die. A lot. I feel like I should be compensated with mini-games that can only be played while a corpse.
---
That's what happens when you balance everything with a philosophy of "bring the player not the class".
---
Everything is "balanced".....at the cost of classes being flavorful and unique. Nobody is allowed to be special anymore, everyone has to be the same for the sake of "balance".
---
What’s wrong with sucking dick my dude?
---
17/34/0. Great for dps and totally fine for tanking unless you are literally the main tank of a super serious guild and need to be the 1 warrior with points in prot.
---
Even at 30s a pop I wouldn’t bother. Hundreds of encounters in BGs. Not worth it
---
So someone can literally screenshot someone standing still and accuse them of frequently afking games? Is this a joke?
---
OP then continues to say that I said  "I have better things to do than play with you shitters" and that it was "in the stream". This is a blatant lie, here is the FULL VOD for your reference:  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/521135518](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/521135518)   
---
While its true that I wasn't completely active 100% of the time, you can see that I clearly wasn't "AFK" and gone for all of AV. That's pretty ridiculous and this whole post is a witchunt.

But that only targets, how do you open up the chat with him without having to click?
---
Its that really true though? When I first started playing vanilla pservers 4 years ago, i didn't use any guides, I just played the game like it was fresh and explored. But obviously 4 years later of playing this game I'm not doing "discovery" stuff, and of course I'm minmaxing it. Minmaxing makes this game replayable for years and years, it's a good thing.
---
Do you have any map addons?
---
This would really Strike home..
---
But it would miss
---
Yeah it drives me nuts that i’ll be tanking a dungeon flicking stances and using all these little tricks and the Mages can’t even get their shatter combo correct..
---
They CoC then Nova and I lol everytime.
---
There’s no such thing as a pve chad.
---
25-30 mins queues today
---
I’ll take this over AFK streamers
---
Ask to be put in a melee group on AoE heavy fights and smash prayer of healing. You can get up to 1.2k hp/s on shazzrah this way if you dodge the counterspells
---
Cool story, bro.
---
av when it’s played right is fun imo. summoning the lords!
---
But when you stay in battle stance because you know that night elf hunter is gonna dodge soon... and you then crit... oh yea. That’s the business
---
All abilities in vanilla have partial resists where the spells last for 25, 50 or 75% of their normal durations. It's why you'll have 50 second saps break after ~10s or poly's only lasting 5s.
---
"omg computers are like magic" 😂
---
There's nothing intelligent about a scripted path with a hard coded interrupt, but hey, you do you bro
---
Yup, humans can get Maladath or Anubisath down the road though which are extremely strong.
---
Orcs best +axe option is probably Zulian Hacker which is already outclassed by other options by its release.
---
probably. Stop stalking me.
---
I don't know why people are trying so hard to deny this. Sure, some people were realistic and said it would be easier this time around. The majority went on and on about how hard it'll be and it would take at least a couple weeks for a guild to down rag. Now that it was done several days after launch everyone is sticking to this artificial story that everyone maintained that it would be easy.
---
If it makes you feel better we've been doing it for longer without a Mageblade.
---
must be if its worthy of a comment 😂
---
Interesting - does it show as resist on combat text? I often see resist when the skill appears to have landed, this would make a lot of sense.
---
As I mentioned, just the first clip, there's a reason that is 30 seconds long and this is 2 minutes.
---
Okay. Blizzard said for a year they were using the 1.12 client and they still did their brain dead no changes chant. Changes were happening no matter what. But why make them better and functional?
---
Sort of like the idea of duel island. Not a huge fan of ranked bg’s being added to vanilla. And I think that the open PvP area goes against the spirit of the game. The point of vanilla is the entire world is the open PvP area.
---
Usually those people are massive multiboxers. It's pretty simple, three accounts with one character each (at least one of whom must be a level 20+ warlock) per location. It's just a lot of money they spend.
---
Somethings probably wrong with it. Ranking is pretty painfully slow but not at rank 3. You should atleast be moving up 50%+

---
I know something like this was posted already.  But it honestly deserves to be posted more.
---
You're right. Let's blame the retail players for how refined the meta is!  /s
---
Wpvp = Ganking dungeon entrances and flight masters. I don't see anything fun in that. Transferred to pve server and it was the best decision I ever made in this game. There is no "glory" in sticking with bad gaming system. Real pvp is in bg's (or arena). Not just using numbers (masses) to your advantage.
---
Its only as good as u are, its really unforgiving to minor mistakes eating up your xp/h. I had around 65k overall with many deaths included. 
---
Gold is pretty good like 4-5g in pure gold from all graves and then all items. I did around 2.5-3 runs / h at peak performance. Minor move speed on boots is king and imp coc is a must and lots of bring hp/mana pots.
---
There are plenty of better ppl out there doing a lot better than my stats since im a mediocre mage when it comes to aoe farming.
---
They might not have shatter, most leveling mages don't. Also having CoC break your Nova instantly can be a recipe for disaster.
---
Not with 5-10m queues.
---
What's the most efficient way to farm places like ulda? Stealth past the trash and just solo bosses? Bear form and swipe packs to death? Kitty form and burn em one at a time? Whenever I try soloing dungeons it just goes so painfully slow I feel like I must be missing something.
---
Roll Alliance you nerd. Literally everyone begged and pleaded to relax when P2 launched or this would happen. Now that it is happening all of a sudden the Horde are crying. You all deserve this. Welcome to a community game.
---
That is the reason why I leveled up my warrior as dual. Missing with a 3.8 weapon is cancer. So much better with two weapons.
---
\&gt;Misses 10 attacks in 6 seconds
---
So much better
---
I enjoy bigglesworth but it seems pretty horde dominant. Zones seem covered in horde and I rarely run into alliance to give PvP opposition so I imagine quest grouping isn’t great for them. It’s awesome for horde though the servers hopping like 24/7.
---
The only fight your pet dies is shazzrah and everything else is just bad pet management. 
---
Write a healer and tell him to heal your pet in his free time. If you have mc on clear they are happy to push their heal meters.
---
&gt; the honor should be nerfed into the ground so we can play WSG with our friends instead.
---
Talk about wanting to have your cake and eat it too. What a pathetic thing to say. Just play WSG with your friends pussy. Or is honor more important than your friends?
---
and don't forget that that mage will totally wreck you in PvP.
---
Ah shoot. Need to re-up my retail account....
---
Oh no, something killed Horde, rush to nerf!
---
You forgot the best part. In retail every raid tier is a full gear reset, like what expansions are meant to do
---
hey its the dumbass again. not surprised
---
I don’t get why iaoth and rapid fire speed up aimed shot but your quiver doesn’t contribute to increased cast speed. 
---
Would give hunter the missing dps in late game.
---
by either pressing your stealth bind again or if you use a !stealth macro press your unstealth macro.
---
What’s the highest in First Aid a level 19 can go?
---
But what does it parry with?
---
My only two characters are a 46 and 31, both warriors, and this happens so often. I actually died to a mob my level once because my attacks didn't land 7 times in a row
---
I wonder if I would've hit 60 by now if I was on another class. The Warrior death march definitely clashes with how interesting I find the class
---
I just make a raid with one of my low level alts and it doesn't spam it anymore.
---
Was leveling with a buddy who's new to the game. I spent the whole run from the questgiver to the crocs bitching about how long it takes and to be ready for the grind. 4 crocs later and it drops...
---
Time to drink health potion
---
Warrior/Mage Battle Mage!
---
You sound like a butthurt hordie who was probably griefing Alliance FPs a week ago.
---
I think that might be stretching the definition of a premade a bit. Its not rocket science to coordinate the pretty simple strats of AV even with randos.
---
Your response was basically "no it’s not" what kind of novel did you expect me to write? Its hypothetical.
---
Fights being short sucks and ruins it if too short, but many of the benefits to shadow bolt would also boost dots, life drain is consistent dips and doubles with corruption on nightfall procs. In a longer fight I wonder if it would even out.
---
Threat is also a factor with healing that would be a problem but raw dips over time I wonder.
---
This is a funny post. I have a 29 twink warrior. I often go 20-2 or 14-0 etc. I mean I am a gnome so I have escape artist. That helps. But dead in the water? I two shot people left and right. Im also undefeated vs a rogue 1v1.
---
What do you do vs a lock? You don't. You simply don't attack them. I only go after AGI based classes unless they have the flag etc. If you're attacking classes you're not strong vs ...you're a bad PvP player.
---
I love when I hear the sound of cheapshot. Easy prey for me. Overpower chop chop dead. And dont say they sucked. Ive had bouts between tons of twink rogues from all different servers. Some with duel crusader etc. They all die. 
---
Warriors wreck 29. People often tell me I do STUPID damage. But im perfect. I have 2100 hp and Overpower for 600 pop etc. Warriors are highly based on their gear so if you're not perfect yes warriors will be garbage. 
---
3 rogues could stealth up to the roof when I have the flag and I will kill of 3 of them as long as overpower procs which it always does.
---
i made 10g today in my first death roll. i had to walk away out of fear of starting a addiciton
---
Blizzard aoe specs don't pick up shatter as blizzard can't crit.
---
Capping snowfall is legit, it helps the rush
---
Doesn't even matter who has it but it certainly helps people not get stuck in fos forever
---
I cap it every game now
---
remove spellbatching on classic for a start
---
Depends on your aesthetic triggers. For me Undercity is amazing. A vast sprawling city underneath an entire city. The decrepit decorations, the river of slime. All just fantastic. I’m also a sucker for underground circular cities so Ironforge is pretty great too. I’m a fan of a more natural look of Horde architecture. From the spiky buildings of Org to the retrofitted towns of the undead. It comes down to personal taste and personal fantasy.
---
You might also be breaking the fear with your next auto attack. Setting up a macro that makes you stop auto attacking after casting your fear can prevent this.
---
So basically, duel arena, clan wars, and the wilderness from OSRS. Solid ideas.
---
Huge story reasons. Part of what makes Classic WoW special is that is has a story and lore with sides and a complex history.
---
Not being able to communicate with opposite factions is a an amazing example of war
---
He’s gonna find a another tank and he won’t miss ya
---
100%. He just lied in his reply, lol. We all know this dude was the kid camping IF and wondering why all the alliance quit and now he’s asspained that alliance win AV. Well to take a quote from the horde the last month “lol cry more! Should’ve rolled alliance you fucking scrubs!”
---
If im limited on time or mana ill usually only buff myself, then the warriors (tanks), then mages, warlocks and so on.
---
Shatter frostbite fucks with mob grouping. 
---
Makes aoeing a pack more unreliable when you run 3/3 imp blizz for spellcleave pulls, since the mobs don’t break out of frost nova as cleanly.
---
You run frostbite in a zf gy run and you’ll likely get kicked because you’re deadass running a talent that can wipe the party.
---
Got our first in 8 weeks finally!
---
He doesn’t think true PvPers are the people trying to get rank 14, he thinks they’re the people who actually want or PvP while at the same time not getting murdered in their honor gain.
---
I mentioned single-target frostbite as a spec in itself, I use it for general questing on a frost Mage because everytime frostbite procs the mob blows up. 
---
Definitely can't AoE and frostbite
---
Alliance its instat popping in EU atleast
---
If I plan to be in cat form for a while, I throw regrowth on myself since it's spread over like 20 seconds. Often lets me stealth, get to full energy, kill the target and have near or full hp to continue attacking. 
---
I only use healing touch if I am severely low hp, since that's the only time it's worth it to stop moving and be mana efficient. I usually use rejuvenation to top off since it doesn't stop me from running for 3 seconds.
---
5 minutes is optimistic now that a lot of alliance hit exalted. 7-8 minutes is the norm, while at night it is at 15+ minutes.
---
Because he's always OOM?
---
The can apparently spawn in AV too my friend showed one to me yesterday
---
Eh, just do emp runs, drop rate is also much higher from Emp.
---
Careful with this. Gambling in any way is against ToS
---
Must be a horde thing, Alliance has plenty of druid/paladin healers grinding for their offhand/offspec loot and i believe shamans are the same.
---
People take this game WAY too seriously good lord lol
---
Anyways cool vid OP, I’ve always loved the idea of shaman tanks
---
Same reason people hated LFG
---
Rattle, keep in mind that this person was getting 50k honor a week before AV came out.
---
Honor ranking is based on how you are compared to the rest of the server.
---
Now that I'm exalted, I don't mind some more proper AV matches. But when I was grinding, I was inwardly cursing defenders (except the ones who slows horde down on balinda) on both sides as all I cared about was the fast rep.
---
Not true. Shaman have highest single target threat in game with ES, rockbiter, cl opener etc. The issue is that they struggle with aoe threat, but can easily switch between a few targets and hold aggro. The real issue is that they werent optimized for tanking well even though it seems like blizz had plans for them to be decent tanks, they probably just filled deadlines or something.
---
But yeah, I mean it's not as efficient or practical to  totem tank, it's a total meme, but it's not like mc needs min maxing rn. they're much better as healers in group settings, but saying they generate less threat than wars is just not true.
---
This. 49 and 59 were usually not twinked either so you had the best battles there. Premade vs Premades were kinda fun as well, but most of the time it was just premades vs pugs.
---
I can use but I can’t make the runecloth bandage?
---
It’s not that you can’t kill them. It just takes a while and eats a ton of your health bar so you spend time bandaging or eating that you could just use fighting more mobs.
---
I have 25% crit on my warrior and I swear I only crit overpower 25% of the time.  Feels like the talent isn’t working.  Anyone else get this?  I know I should actually count them up and do a test but I’m constantly getting 3-5 overpowers in a row not criting.  Confirmation bias definitely a possible answer but man wtf.
---
Want instant queues? Roll alliance.
---
False. He is friendly as horde.
---
Threat sensitive fights
---
Should I no life AV this weekend to get exalted? I have a feeling that as more people get exalted the games are going to get longer and the queues as horde will continue to get longer.
---
I'm halfway to revered as of tonight.
---
And they say horde have the beast/ugly races
---
It's not just about your heals. BoP, freedom, stunning enemies, bubbling to ensure 12 seconds of uninterrupted heals is just unbeatable.
---
Any melee class vs a mage might as well fuck themselves
---
Fair enough.
---
As far as shatter, iirc it’s not run by aoe mages because we pick ice shards preferentially as we can’t run frostbite for the above reasons, and because the points from shatter (and ice shards) can be used to build into the arcane tree for arcane concentration (clearcasting), arcane resilience, and arcane meditation, which doesn’t leave many, if any points to put into shatter if you’re also planning on picking up ice barrier, which is essential for pulling mobs on a mount.
---
This build 100% assumes that you really aren’t planning to do any singe pulls, and being a mage, that isn’t too far fetched.
---
Correct
---
Seriously though I just want the rep, I'll fully admit that I won't return to AV on my main hits exalted. I've never enjoyed PvP too much, and as a prot warrior I enjoy it even less, but I really want those rep rewards.
---
I don't want a long drawn out battle, for me it's a waste of time. Win or lose I'd rather have short battles. The sooner I get exalted the sooner I can get out of the way of those who want to PvP.
---
Naah before you had to fight past everything but it was nerfed to hard. Was wpvpve
---
Faction unique classes too. Having that I hereby imbalance of Shaman and Paladin being faction specific meant you had to figure out specific tactics for each new raid. 
---
Take Nef for example. Pallies made the phase 3 transition a bit easier because they could help the aoe burn in a more meaningful way. My Horde guild wound up having everyone use dynamite and bombs to get our first kills
---
He's not wrong, we have a cross server discord for AV simultaneous queuing, regularly get 15+ which is plenty to kill galv, lts and drek and win games in 7-11mins
---
Reap what you sow baby
---
Close, but half the time Galv doesn't even die.  And alliance has way more losses from all the officers lol.
---
Paladin warrior. Unstoppable killing machine then. Imagine a warrior being able to cast freedom to remove and immune all slows and roots and sit on you. And when he's low he just bubbles and heals himself to full. Don't forget that he can also use LoH for another full heal later. And he has a 6 second stun plus mortal strike. 
---
Actually sounds awfully like Wotlk druids. xD
---
My guild just got their 4th mageblade in a row. Last weekend's raid (which was the 4th mageblade) we also saw a binding and the eye drop. Bananas.
---
RNG is a truly fickle thing.
---
Thunderfury is the pinnacle for tanks. Helps with multi target tanking to no end
---
I feel bad for the horde on heart seeker. On the minority faction and have to wait for bg ques.
---
Music?
---
I think the first wave of people was so excited by the release, that they grinded it out in a couple of months. There was also this race to reach 60 that everyone seemed to be swooped by. Resulting in some/most people min/maxing to 60 clear all the content, then gets bored.
---
I believe the game already does this. Not sure how it reacts when you dont have the resources for that ability though
---
Watch a video as a guide so you understand it, use the correct downranks and consumables. Have friendly nameplates and keep track of which wave you’re on. It’s very easy.
---
Point is that their queue times is so long that they pretty much always deliver them.
---
"So F healing! I can do better for my group's victory as burst dps who gets oom after 1 fight!"

Elemental Shaman, Shadow priest and OOMkin (at some degree).

PvP power/resil gear
---
Buying pvp blues with honor
---
Buying pvp purple's with conquest
---
I miss this alot.
---
Nope - not doing your click three links bullshit
---
This. So many of my wins were 8 minute games where we got 990 honor and horde 3k. But I did it to farm my rep so I didn't care.
---
Worth it.
---
I would put some research in finding a good server, though. That matters a lot.
---
I think Wowhead has a server population page. To see which server has a good population for the faction you wish to join.
---
Also, I'd recommend PvE servers for a new player.
---
Nah. Single difficulty means a single brutally easy difficulty. Youd basically kill hardcore raiding by doing that.
---

I’ve enjoyed them both. Av I find a warrior and pocket heal him. Wsg I get treated like royalty.
---
Actually going to places in the world.
---
42 minutes oof
---
Skarm Tank is good.
---
His videos are cool too. Very neat guides and discussion on warriors and tanking.
---
whats the top bar addon called
---
He's actually right.... not that anyone cares.  AI isn't a complex if / then.  "If herb present, farm" .  AI in gaming is a bit bastardized in my opinion... we call things AI and all they do is aggro and run a script.
---
AI outside of gaming requires some kind of learning to be taking place.  For example no one says an IVR has AI, but its doing the same kind of if then.  "If 1 then route to billing".
---
Well that was embarrassing to read.
---
I'm a try this. I hate bagnon lol
---
You know how theres no AP in the game and all upgrades are immediately recognized and wearable?     
---
      
---
Yeah, that.
---
I wish my guild wasn't a piece of shit.
---
The end game content in retail is a lot more challenging then classic.
---
High parses in MC often mean learning poor habits when the more challenging content comes along. I keep telling the priests in our guild to ignore that shit as there is way too many variables, use logs to learn about yourself, not yourself compared to others. You have different roles to fill, raid healing vs tank healing for instance. Different tactics for different bosses can lead to additional healing needed padding the meters. It’s all rubbish. High parse often means you’re spamming flash heal which is dumb. 
---
I would advise looking more at your overhealing, choice of spells etc.
---
You lost
---
Do you have anything showing a fury prot vs a shaman competing for threat? Also warrior have multiple taunts making them far superior to shamans in more ways than one.
---
Just humans making bots play with eachother. It's like putting a dildo into a fleshlight
---
I still play Stromghold/Crusader Extreme. They are very nice.
---
Yeah, only thing is thats its got a sort button, but other than that I'm not a fan either.
---
I've seen Faerlina peeps give A LOT of grief to PvE server playera in BGs. Elitist attitudes. Herod isn't much better (the server I play on). Lots of min-maxers here.

Exactly

Ok start a west coast raiding guild get a mt some ots handful of healers and dps officers. Go to town on the open market and get thr best west coast players. Probably there are many that work from home that raid on east time zones then do over time when the raid is done.
---
Innervates are highly dependent on the situation. Often, before raids are on farm, the innervate is better given to a healer or mage.
---
I could see a cool RP style universe where people basically run their own npcs on a programmed behaviour when they arent at their pc or something.
---
Hah.. Calling it a hostage situation.. Get a grip man.
---
These types of games get a little more common once everyone is exalted and people start getting bored.
---
How do you get xp like that from AV?
---

Fire on the staff needs to be frost, and there needs to be Netflix in another window.
---
I'm glad it triggered you :)
---
That's not what min-maxing is though, I'm guessing people simply don't understand the term? Min-maxing is doing every little thing you can (min) to gain the maximum potential out of your character. Not doing the minimal to get max.
---
They should've launched classic wow in about 25 more years, when we are all in our cyber Cafe style nursing homes with a Quantum gpu, Intel i95 chips and brainwave based macros.
---
More class identity (not all classes must have good mobility, defense cd, slow, stun and self healing in their kit)
---
Class specific quests to get some spells.
---
Spell ranking (and some spells ranking looked behind tomes found in end game content)
---
Professions mattering
---
Attunments
---
No more randomized gear and normalized stats
---
Specific and unique item effec (ties into the no normalized stats)
---
No more time gating for world reputations
---
Remove god aweful sharding
---
Titan panel
---
Who won? That looks epic.
---
Yall downvote him but he’s correct. A bunch of If statements is not AI
---
You just need six or seven mostly-unemployed housemates who like board games
---
Tbh that's a great length for AV.  
---
Too short and it's underwhelming.  
---
Too long and it feels like a drag.
---
Rushing Drek is just a bad strategy. Even a small horde defense will easily turn the game into a massive turtle because you took no graveyards along the way. And, if you're gonna wait for frostwolf graveyard well then you might as well have just done Galv and all the lieutenants around iceblood graveyard anywyas because it takes 5 min to cap frostwolf. And, to top it all of, it gives literally 1/4th of the honor you get from killing all the lieutenants, commanders and grabbing towers.
---
I got the pantaloons on my priest 1st run
---
??
---
ITS only 25% Horde, i think many stopped Playing because ally camped every instance
---
The only quest that is necessary is the one that gives you the insignia. I don’t recall the game but you get in Arathi outside of the bg (or somebody can share). Other than that just kinda follow the herd and you will get a sense of the strat. Sadly I think that the real answer is you just have to throw time at it. Just do the quests you have as you can and grind is the only advice I have.
---
Pretty sure it's just the advertising of gambling in public channels. You're free to do what you want otherwise.
---
Hey man it's good exp xD
---
78 literal runs. I'm glad I'm a caster.
---
As a warrior, I care about the rewards. That being said, I’d rather spend more time trying to get them while actually enjoying myself, so I definitely don’t hate the 40 minute rounds where pvp actually happens. They’re a little closer to how I feel AV was originally supposed to be played.
---
Sub 15m or bust. Anything else is a boring mindless zergfest. Get real reddit
---
If there's something you want from being exalted, then absolutely yes. 
---
The further we get from when BGs dropped, the longer the queues will become in my opinion (at least for Horde).
---
They're built into ElvUI
---
What? I know it doesn't drop from emp right now...........I was referring to the later phase when specific loot is getting moved/updated which include HoJ being moved to Emp with a higher chance to drop.
---
Compared to a warrior in defensive gear with a shield? Agreed.
---
Compared to a dual wielding warrior in 'threat' gear? Not much of a difference.
---
And I can't seem to get out of combat to drink.
---
Wait what the fucks are bots? Lmao
---
Id recommend using Hurricane or that 1.5 attack speed gun with a +7 dmg scope. Since your focusing arcane shot youll never use aimed shot. Thus these quick attacking weapons will allow for IAoH to proc much more often.
---
In conjuction with that, Ive read that Hurricane+Scope is 1 dps tham dwarcen Hand cannon (without IAoH proc). And when it comes to molten core, mobs are immune to fire but not frost. Thus making Hurricane with its passive surpass it in MC and BWL. 
---
This is the kinda build im developing. Though, Im curious, does +1% spell crit increase chances of arcane shot crits? Or did you just grab it for the +SP?
---
Nothing wrong with running no questie
---
You're either 
---
A. On a hugely unbalanced server
---
B. Get all your information from reddit
---
C. Or oblivious and bad
---
I lvled from 51 to 60 right after phase 2 hit. I did all quests in ungoro(minus the goblin escort.) and winterspring. And a few quests in a few other zones. And phase two just made lvling that much more fun. Although the pvp server I'm on is quite balanced 45/55 roughly.
---
Titanforging for 5-10 extra levels probably isn't bad, it's a nice bonus if it happens but nothing to go out of your way for.  20-30 possible extra levels is just insane though.
---
Honestly sometimes you just gotta F it.  If you're not pushing top end raiding or mythics, no point chasing the white rabbit.
---
a GDKP pug doesnt give a fuck. highest bid wins
---
Oh true, but as ele shaman its still higher dmg to go for spell dmg blues on a lot of the items, so though it would be the same as spell hunter.
---
Easy mode? You're the faction with paladins my friend.
---
Every Grob player has made that opinion abundantly clear in every AV I’ve been in.
---
450dps isn’t low for ragnaros. OP didn’t specify, and since he was bragging, I figured he was referring to the fights where dps is higher, like magmadar
---
There are simply not enough DD warriors in our guild, all are in other statics.
---
And the purple Pvp mage set shoulders
---
Scrolled down to see if I was recognizing the song correctly. Holy nostalgia!
---
There's only one regard when it comes to the honor grind, and that's honor/hour. So unless your BGs are perfectly balanced, there is going to be a best one. Currently, that's AV.
---
Is this an attempt at comedy
---
More and more people catch up to backdoor jump though.
---
I still love my pandara dps cloak for time walking events.  The proc is amazing on it.  Shadowmourne is fun for them also.
---
:|
---
&gt;:(
---
See, you've got that wrong. The best guilds do it in an hour, but that is a miniscule percentage. Doing a full clear in 2 hours means that you are one of the better guilds, and I can assure you that you are in a minority.
---
Sonydigital, Zetox, Jaelaw, and Toez are all good pvp steamers. Toez is usually a priest, but he's ranking on his hand of rag wielding warrior.
---
Lmao i love the Stronghold 2 music
---
As a Horde PvE server player I feel shafted. Awesome PvE focused gear is locked behind Rank 7 and AV Exalted, so you know what we had to do? We had to go to TM and get farmed by the Alliance who outnumber us on the server to try and pick off the stealthies that went in too far. Now in AV we not only have long queues but also due to the meta Alliance farm rep way faster than us. I just want my sweet offhand, man. For someone who doesn't like PvP this kinda sucks.
---
Back in wotlk I always tried to get 22 affliction locks and 1 spriest for 3 drakes. Never got it but for some reason I liked the idea of all the dots lol I’m a little odd I know
---
fake news, alliance posted this picture!
---
Idk man bots usually create a blacklist radius where they died and do their best to ress further and further away from it. They also see nearby enemies and understand aggro range. If you want to mess with it I would recommend mind control kidnapping and throwing it off a cliff or something to screw the navigation system. And yes obviously I've botted before
---
oh no
---
Most runs in my exp are 1-3 orbs. But its the potential. Tank res 1 orb means you all basically pitched in 6g each to rent a tank. But the more orbs that drop, the more you might as well have shelled out to rent this tank. No strat live run should ever have the potential to have rented a tank for ~100g or more. No tank is that skilled or geared to warrant it (imo).
---
Already there on Alliance side :D Great server
---
Considering Warlocks can almost never lose 1v1s already, that's a good shout.
---
av meta is honestly really nice cause most of the rankers in my guild are warriors so having 15 warriors in an AV premade is pretty nice. Also no consumes needed, no worrying about dodging other premades to be efficient with honor per hour, and its way less stressful. Just been shooting the shit all day and collecting honor :)
---
I'm camped in the portal... Instaqueue

Loool i just bought a new laptop and finally stronghold crusader is resetted and i can play it again. So awesome to see others still going at it too :D

Circle kiting with cone is safer, as resists don't ruin you as badly. Probably what I would go with.
---
One thing they don't tell you. Leaning to do this right takes a lot of practice. Expect to suck hard at it at first, and don't ever expect to do it as cleanly as the best examples on YouTube or twitch.
---
u can solo angerforge if ur a rogue
---
The best? You literally just described ironforge. The difference being that ironforge is a stones throw away from mc and bwl. And pretty close to naxx as well.
---
I loved the Mage Tower.  Completing all 36 was stressful at times, but it was enlightening to figure out how to do it for each spec.
---
Paladins are broken as fuck anyway. If it was a bug it had to be fixed.
---
Shadowpriests should be taking them out tbh, they can easily outheal the damage and get close and take them out 1by1 from outside. Better than them doing doing 15k dmg to a few lieutenants and then being oom. They only need to kill 3 too.
---
nice
---
That or he took a picture with one.
---
How is it being a coward to pick off the 60% percenters? That's exactly what I do as a fellow Horde 60% Hunter. You guys are absolutely right, alliance just zooms by me with no care as me and my rogue bros pick off a healer or two or 6 in the back. Its great. Its why AV has been dominated by the horde the past 24 hours. If the Horde just defense with a small force ya'll alliance get rekt
---
4 hand of rags in a single pixel
---
It is, but unless your guild is being hardcore for some reason that shouldn’t be how they handle it
---
I feel like the insanely fast AV rep gains were in response to the battlegrounds lasting on average 4 to 5 hours. Now you get Exalted in a few days of playing with the rushed meta. I would be very down for defensive turn ins and boas buffs swaying how the game pans out. 
---
Warsong and AV take months because the games usually dont go above one hour. I miss the AV that felt like an actual war, the other BGs always felt like small objectives, which is great too.
---
Right now WSG takes less time than AV.
---
Been thinking about this all week.  Currently Rank 3 but top 5 for honor on my faction.
---
If I maintain I should be skipping ranks and have a blue PvP set before the end of the month, which as a Druid the movement speed is massive.
---
No one is complaining but assuming someone does, why would I give up my hard work so they're happy?  I kinda get it and understand where you're coming from but at the same time the system rewards people who put in more time so I earned it not them.  Have any additional insight?
---
It would be even better if honor collection were actually skill based in some fashion rather than just going to whoever has the most time played. And I'm saying this as someone who is probably total trash.
---
I agree that AV rewards too much honor but it was built in an era of gaming that wasn't so laser-focused on the destination, it was more about the journey. People love to reminisce about long AVs back in Vanilla and, if you consider how long the average game was at the time the honor and rep rewards made more sense.
---
You need more colors in your chat frame
---
I’ve never played alliance past level ten (goofy NPC voices bug me, general fake seeming positivity bugs me, can’t attack gnomes) but the layout of UC has to be the best in the game.
---
Could it be an add on needs updating?
---
rankers should start paying people with alts (gold) to do this
---
On PvE servers you can flag yourself for PvP, keep trying to duel the bot, and eventually it will try and attack you and then you can just HK them lol.
---
use gold
---
Worked before pvp doesnt now
---
Looks like the alliance zerg got busted and they no clue what to do next and just turtled lol.
---
That's super funny because I played a spriest in vanilla and I'm pretty sure I used to do the same thing I'm doing now. One spriest in a pve AV environment isn't doing much unless it's taking out a bunch of non elites that are hampering their team.
---
Rogues and druids are good at it too but they're also very useful elsewhere.
---
The weirdest thing was in my first AV I still had the tower deadzones worked out to cap the banners in the towers with all the NPCs still up. Like it was a reflex I had long since forgot about.
---
I agree with you friend. We certainly *should* voice unpopular opinions.
---
Come back when you gonna have 2 of them noob :D
---
Classic, Retail, don't matter - I'm just so done with mud huts and spikes as the dominating Horde building theme.
---
What? Which continent are you on? I've had about 15 WSG and only one was against a premade when I queued random, which they lost (they ran 3 warriors and we had 5 (!) mages). I queued one WSG with my guild, the waiting time was way longer and we met another premade.
---
11 weeks here with 11 The Eye of Divinity drops. RNG is RNG.

yeah see, here's mine, you'll notice a slight deviation in our times.

How to ensure that you are joining a turtle: Be the turtle. Take Stonehearth GY. ;)
---
True classic graphics
---
if i have 300 fishing, and I fish in AV, does attaching a lure+75 mean I will have a higher chance to catch nightfin more often (assuming if its night)? Or does having a higher fish rate not mean anything for AV fishing
---
I was told WSG is better honor but I haven't checked it myself, has the one who told me this been clueless?
---
On alliance i just scroll to the bottom of the list and join the latest one. If the queue doesnt pop after 10 sec i leave and requeue the bottom one. So far 100% success rate of getting a fresh aV.
---
Screenshot looks like it was handsewn.
---
I know I might get shit for this but I hate Transmog so much. I hate that in retail nobody is ever actually wearing what their characters actually are wearing, it's a joke. Gear has no identity in retail, it's all item number, players barely look at stats. In classic if you join a pug dungeon and you see your tank has a T2 helm and draconian deflector you feel a little better about how the run will go.
---
Yes, the raid frames are ElvUI as well as the Main Tank and (unseen) Main Assist.
---
Not a clue
---
Doesn't mean much when the majority of them are leavers.
---
So is there a way to sign up for a turtle? I don't like waiting 12 mins for an AV that ends after 7 minutes.
---
If you played the first couple days you had it a lot better. I’m kicking myself because even as Ally (thank god) I did 13h today for like 18k rep.
---
Wait, you *practiced* your speed run before the game actually launched?
---
You're right it isn't, just don't be an asshole and actually contribute to the match, really that simple.
---
There's some addons like Titan Panel that have the same kind of information. 
---
The information under the minimap, as well as under both chat panels, is called Data Texts in ElvUI.
---
I'm guessing it somehow got ninja looted to him. Both epics are from Golemagg, so he probably just honked them both for the memes.
---
Talent tees
---
Well the sucky part is that no one is doing dungeons anymore, can't do onxiya attunement :(
---
I went on a 4 hour winstreak as Alliance today. Horde do win some, but the Ally zerg still wins basically every game as long as you get most of the raid to do the same thing.
---
Only RNG related to loot should be if it drops or not. I hate how gear have random effects and to get your BiS you have to basically farm that same piece of gear over and over again. 
---
I would also 100% return master loot to game. Personal loot is fine solution for pug raids, it helps prevent unfairness in pugs. But as member of guild I want to be able to discuss who get's the item.
---
It’s my first ever time playing WoW too and while I’ve now got Questie installed (my IRL friends got to 60 WAY before me so I’m playing alone now) I still ignore it sometimes and go a wandering :) It’s definitely helped me with some of those ‘hidden’ quests that I wouldn’t have found otherwise. I’m still only level 38, so it hasn’t rushed me through at all. Just been a good help at times to a compete gaming newbie :)
---
WoW was a huge a technical achievement for its time. MMO’s are monsters to both build and run. A lot of what you are suggesting is possible but the problem is the time and therefore risk that goes with building something like that
---
Then that settles it
---
I’ve only played Tauren and gnome, might be right.
---
If it's about engaging gameplay there's still no reason to feel bad about opposite factions.
---
you mean horde turtle, because alliance has the rush advantage
---
Skeram if you are more of a "hard mode" type of player. To be clear it isn't because we have few alliance, there are just a fuck ton of horde!
---
Meanwhile every quest run I do on any character ive made ive seen either hoj, sgc, circlet of flame, banthok, or ironfoe drop. They just happen to drop when im not on the character I need it for.
---
&gt;Sword of Zeal
---
I need to issue a correction. I looked at the spreadsheet in more detail, and the proc was not modeled for Sword of Zeal. This neglected the value of the proc entirely. Data puts the proc at 1.8 ppm. The average value of the proc is to add about 5.5 weapon damage to both weapons (it can proc 10 damage on both weapons for 15 seconds). I put in the calculations in my copy of the spreadsheet to model the proc. After correctly accounting for the proc, Sword of Zeal comes out slightly better than Thrash Blade (about 0.6 dps higher) when decked out in good raid gear. The gap is a little larger at lower gear levels. This favors Sword of Zeal MH / Mirah's OH.
---
Matchmaker should preferentially match groups with similar sized groups, and/or people of same rank, and/or introduce a Skill Rating (SR) system for each player and match them against players of similar skill, based perhaps on their win %. Oh whoops I accidentally redesigned the game to make more sense.
---
*The granary is empty sir! Our hop plants are overrun with hop weevil! Our apple orchards are barren m'lord, the people suspect witchcraft! Your popularity is falling!*

Ahh, I have to replay that relaxing game soon.
---
Your first comment is absurdly hard to read dudr
---
Small correction: Spell penetration was present at release. It is one of the set bonuses for mage T1. However, a majority of the other spell penetration items did indeed come with AQ.
---
I'm totally with you as long as herb and mining nodes only go directly towards the game happening. I don't need people trying to farm gold in my BGs. Extend the same for fishing where ponds become objectives to fight and I'm all for it.
---
But did he do it though?
---
so much this.
---
True pvpers don't care about honor. They just want to pvp.
---
Sulfuras. Active Alliance community. We are outnumbered but not terribly so. We could use a few reinforcements.
---
Well, it is a picture of Lok inside the alliance keep.  Kinda guessing it didnt take many horde to wipe the zerg and the rest had already pushed north pretty hard so alliance had nowhere to respawn besides their own base.
---
how much do your arcane shots hit for lmao

The spreadsheet did not model the proc. I updated my copy of the spreadsheet to model the proc. With this update, I can now see that the Sword of Zeal is better than the Thrash Blade with current raid gear (very slightly), meaning that if you already have Sword of Zeal, you should use that in your MH and Mirah's OH.
---
Hell yeah.  I've got durotar down to ~1.5 hours to level 10.  Shit made getting ahead of the zerg day 1 super easy.
---
Please tell me how I can play with my friends in AV.
---
I know it's just a game but your mentality is exactly the reason why the middle East keep fighting. You should be more rational
---
Yeah I was at like 20 losses before revered and I decided I dint care much to count anymore. At least if there aren't premades we win WSG and AV soon.
---
He's saying the opposite of this.
---
Yes that is indeed the macro that I have. No specific ranks either. It is as follows:
---
\#shoowtooltip Mortal Strike
---
/cast Blood Fury
---
/cast Mortal Strike
---
On the bar it even shows the blood fury icon and not the MS one like it should with the showtooltip. I'm starting to think it has to do with one of my addons or something since this kind of behaviour would also break Nature's Swifness or PoM macro's. If this was the case, all hell would break loose on here and on the forums and that didn't happen :)
---
Flamelash
---
&gt; In Classic every raid is relevant because there isn't a huge gap in item quality between MC to Naxx
---
I wouldn't fully agree with that to be honest. Naxxramas items have 20+ item points more than MC items which is quite a lot. Just the random blues that drop there are higher in item level.
---
It's not so much about old raids being relevant because there isn't a noticeable difference in power creep, it's mostly about a few niche items that still keep those raids relevant.
---
For example you still need to run MC to get Thunderfury, which is a very high boost to any raid but that doesn't mean that most of the gear there isn't going to be disenchanted because your raid can't use it.
---
Same thing with BRE from Ragnaros, you might still want that weapon even if later raids are out because gearing 40 people by just killing the 2 latest bosses that drop a decent weapon isn't that feasible.
---
Generally speaking weapons and trinkets are very scarce, so if your guild raids 3 days a week but you are so progressed that you clear the latest content in 2 then rather than not raiding at all for that last day you might as well try your luck to get some niche items from the older raids that are still useful.
---
TBC is similar in a way where you're still raiding T5 even if your guild has Black Temple and Mount Hyjal on farm, not because the majority of the gear from T5 is useful (most of it is useless at that point) but because there's a few niche items like trinkets and weapons that might still be useful to your raid.
---
So it's mostly the small amount of niche items that still hold the older raids relevant, not because most of the gear there is similar quality to the later raids.
---
naturally as horde i didnt try harpies. any other place doesnt has regular drops anymore except greens, rares or even epics very rarely.
---
Just don't join a server where alliance is the majoirty faction, try to find a server where they are in the slight minority.
---
Want some cheese to go along with your whine?
---
Higher drop rate on the crocs south of the bridge, for me anyway.
---
afk in AV has always been a major problem tho, never really fixed...
---
I have no other option to rank but you have multiple other options for fun and pvp - why do you think it's ok to grief me?
---
wsg is dead
---
Mother fucker... it's another one with high gamma for those bleeding eyes.
---
WHY? WHY THE GAMMA?
---
I'd rather have them banned for griefing.
---
German? -&gt; Patchwerk
---
Flamelash for that unique hardcore zombie apocalypse experience
---
This makes me want to join this kids AV and bullshit around more than anything in the world
---
You don't have to be "inside someone to shred". You can keep writing novels if you want. Saying you're "wasting time" and "masochistic" isnt something useful to add to a conversation. You're writing a novel expounding on a bad opinionated take that isn't useful to anyone.
---
Lmao how is it griefing? This is an MMO, you can’t expect everyone to cater to your way of playing.
---
Rankers still premade AV. Just that Horde can't do it since they have 10 min queues whereas Alliance has instant queues.
---
"I hate this grind but it's the most optimal thing to do. Why would Blizzard force me to do this???"
---
The instance alterac valley was designed with objectives that are meant to be taking. It’s not griefing to play the instance the way blizzard designed it. If you want you can try to take leadership / control by hurrying it along or convincing people to Zerg. They call it “carrying” and it’s what pug honor grinders had to do years ago. Or you can form a wsg premade. Or you can just cry and never receive enough honor to make the brackets required for higher rank. Cause I guarantee plenty of your competitors got higher than 50k honor. Or did you think you were gonna get pretty purples for afking 16 hours a day?
---
Im on EU and maybe its different here but i've played like 20-30h of AV's and have a winrate of 48%. And even if Alliance wins horde usually has more honour lol.
---
Griefing? It's a minigame. People pay 15$ a month just like you and they can do whatever they want. Sounds like your mad because your not handed free ranks by playing a minigame and you have to work for em now.
---
I've had groups complain that the dungeon is going too slow because the tank isn't keeping aggro off the dps as they sit there for 30 seconds drinking.
---
Our rogue would be allowed to use his Second sword on Rag
---
Wat? Bots have never not been there
---
I got it on by accident. Jumped into BRD to help a guild mate and it dropped everyone said they had it already so I said I guess I'll take it.
---
have you read my post? do you have any argument to support your claim? if no to either stop talking to me
---
prtnscrn
---
You could also church your combat log.
---
Not all of us are that way. I can't go anywhere without 3 stacks ready to trade!
---
I'm happy that you say that, but if you look at our warcraft logs we have a LOT of slacker DPS in PvP specs who are pulling very low numbers, it's a miracle we clear it in 2 hours to be honest
---
Fuck that noise. /gquit
---
how the fuck do you get the idea I want peacefull afk grind?
---
50k was one bad day, it 80-140k usually
---
I think you're completely missing my point, I don't want it easier, I want people to stop actively hindering me
---
Man I love these videos
---
I doubt even if he had higher DKP then every mage and warlock he’d be given the mageblade, unless the guild lacks common sense. I think it’s more likely no one else needed it, and therefore it was given to him.
---
You don't even have to go in, as horde anyway, you can do it outside the bunker and even life drain on top of that. A shadow priest and a warlock can take all if them out in a minute or two.
---
I mean it's not a black and white thing where you can do housing only one way, it completely depends on how you implement it.
---
For example in Ultima Online not only could you make your own house but you could create it for a very specific purpose, but that sort of tied very closely into the rest of the game.
---
Player housing just for the sake of it is very useless, it depends on how the rest of the game mechanics support it and give it meaning.
---
I would say that in WoW there isn't really game systems in place to make housing feel meaningful, you would need to add quite a bit into the game than just give players the ability to set up their own house somewhere.
---
That's why you add golem to your anger spam. He's in the next room and all of his drops are healer gear.
---
Ah ok cheers - don’t play casters so I don’t know which weapons they can use
---
Guess that's what happens when people can't find a group for 3 hours because all the Horde side's tanks demand 15g and orb reserves to do an instance.
---
No they are actually trying to help you by making a wsg premade the best honor/h
---
And I’m trying to tell you that the PvP grind is all people trying to actively hinder you. You haven’t even got to the point where your competitors do things to grief you to try and hinder you yet. 50k is an awful day. If I had a 50k day I woulda been fucked for the entire week. Good luck getting r14.
---
It adds to his average per hour. Please try to math just a little bit
---
Which T5 items are worth going for once T6 is on farm? I don't recall doing that at all. In fact my guild started doing T5 on alts in order to attune new recruits or rerolls instead of playing our mains. I may have foggy memory though
---
I like that. It filters out the noobs.
---
I usually press my macro for : /me has flagged you as AFK. Type /AFK to report activity.
---
Get 2-3 people every time.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Priests can use mind vision to check each ID in 30 seconds, so that is still an option.
---
Isnt the pattern dirt cheap now tho? Kind of him still.
---
Come Naxxramas Warlocks will do very very good DPS. Seems kind of harsh to exclude them from gear now because their DPS is not as good compared to Mages
---
Man my first game in revered was a 25 minute win for us and i walked out of that AV at like 1.8k into revered after having just hit it the previous match. The rep was so good with a slightly longer game. Idgaf about honor yet I have 2 characters I want to get exalted.
---
I mained shadow from Bc to early cata and actually made the switch to healing for the first time in bgs yesterday.
---
It's a bit unfair to compare the standard of phase 2 to any previous version of WoW.
---
Vanilla WoW or TBC for that matter never had servers with 10k players online concurrently. The number was a quarter of that.
---
Had Blizzard implemented the actual server numbers from back in the day (around 2.5-3k) the experience of phase 2 would have been much different.
---
Yeah my server discord used to have so much shit talk, people telling each other to kill themselves and things like that.  Now everyone just flames dodgeseeker.  
---
We have put aside our differences to fight a common enemy.
---
No.
---
You wanted vanillas terrible pvp system, you got vanillas terrible pvp system #NOCHANGES.
---
I don't believe you.
---
It won't fix it. The  nerfed state isn't responsible for the massive honor gains, the rush is, and the  rush won't stop just because you buff the content, that has been proven time and time again on private servers. The runs would take slightly slower, but it's not significant enough.
---
Lets share the pain then
---
On alliance, if the queue pops instantly, it's most likely a turtle. If it takes 3+ seconds it's most likely a fresh game. OP's method is fullproof, but mine is for the lazy.
---
Blizzard really had there eyes on screwing you when they made this decade old content lol
---
Literally the worst camera phone picture I have ever seen.
---
Pretty sure OP is taking about a zone where all players are flagged, even on PvE servers.
---
What's a bot? I think you meant to say "free honor kill."
---
Okay, how?
---
How did you get the Mageblade over a caster?
---
[Pretty basic ElvUI.](https://i.imgur.com/1tcLIUO.png) I'll probably replace my skillbars with a WA at some point when I stop being lazy.
---
Ive leveled 3 horde chars and they have less than 8 kills between them for the amulet. Its not that low of a drop chance.
---
All i see is skinning skillup nodes.
---
Which addon is breaking my AV experience?
---
No one has a problem with minmaxers, but the recent AV where people just want their free epics and don't enjoy PvP at all, but will leave once they get exalted is just dumb.
---
Rattlegore
---
I'm not sure how helpful this guide is.
---
Every game I join is brand new, so none have been "turtled" yet.
---
So many different fonts and two types of textures on bars. Makes me sad.
---
John, i haven’t read your book yet. In fact I only just learned about it. 
---
But I still want to reach out and thank you for the work you did on WOW!
---
AV is PVE.
---
that still causes the bot to lose time
---
I see where you come from, but you can´t seriously expect that in a BATTLEGROUND (no matter if this is the rush to boss to win version of av or not) that people do not choose to turtle it and actually do pvp (wich the battleground is designed for). 
---
Alterac for now is just a gamble when it comes to either you will get a rush to boss group or a group that really wants a ways of old Alterac.
---
Instead of vent about it you can always see if the group is goin for turtle, and if it does you can leave because the deserter debuff will always be lower than the time of a turtle av.
---
I did. Light’s hope repack was an amazing tool to do this. Andddddd then we found out (literally days after the launch date was announced) that we were having our second son *the day after launch*. Due to circumstances we had a planned labor so we knew exactly when we’d go in—6 in the morning LOL. Needless to say, I didn’t touch Classic until weeks after launch.
---
For what it’s worth, I had a sub 7 hour level 20 route at the time on Hunter (not without a ton of help from a more experienced friend with Durotar/Barrens routing)
---
As a healer, I always feel like I have no mana. It happened more than a few times that my group called an engage on the enemy flag carrier or something, while I just sat there trying to regenerate SOME mana. Hello.. guys.. please wait &gt;:(
---
What part do you not believe?
---
Fun is subjective.
---
Because no one gives a shit about how fast you or anyone else reaches which pvp rank. Battlegrounds weren't made to farm honor by playing your pve honor farm, even if it's possible. Many people actually go there for entertainment. Your need of self affirmation from a simple computer game is not other people's fault.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Hey man, care to share what you did to solve it? I've been having the same issue, and it's beyond frustrating :(
---
I feel you, I'd love it if aimed shot would be affected by the quiver :)
---
Just give it time. As people start getting their AV rep farmed out the queues for AV will become longer and longer. Once they get long enough the scales will start to tip over, and once people start migrating it will further lead to longer AV queues and shorter WSG queues.
---
None
---
As someone who started playing late vanilla. Whats happening at AQ opening ?
---
I too have read Dark Legacy for more than a decade, it’s the same me comic that has stood the test of time so far. Rest in peace the daily blink, LFG and the others.
---
Absolutely. Its always worth getting into. Dont read to much here though. This place is either negativity central or gamer dad's heaven. Both suck ass. The game is a lot better than this reddit portraits it.
---
It might not be dumb for you but it's an example how minmaxing affects others and makes rules you have to follow.
---
The animation my human warrior does when it procs is hilarious
---
This pisses me off so much. Like, we don’t have enough healers for me to tank more than 1 warmaster, so my hands are tied. What the hell are the rest of these warriors doing, though? I know you’re not a raid geared prot tank but you didn’t show up to PvP wearing anything less than full plate. Take some damage.
---
I didn't play then either, but from everything I read and videos I have seen, imagine every single alliance and horde on your server at the same place at the same time plus elite mobs from AQ spawning.
---
Servers are way bigger now than they were at vanilla, it's going to be crazy
---
I min/max, but on this with AV, i dont agree with you.  
---
Im playing to have fun, and i play how i want it, and its nothing compared to pulling a whole dungeon.
---
if you want to follow a certain tactic you should group queue, which you cant on AV, so you can hope for the tactic you like to be carried out, but if people dont, its not griefing, and in all of the multiverses its not called Griefing.
---
It's the min mazing of others that people dont like. Oh dont give the meme spec X item because it's not best used there people
---
There are ups and downs to playing a PvE server. You avoided the ganking but you have to deal with 10 min queue. No big loss.
---
I understand you and somewhat agree as well, but this is the way it is. 
---
People can kill you in pvp realm and gank you for 5 hours. That is griefing as well. In retail you just turn off warmode in that case.
---
People can kill quest givers. That is griefing, but in retail they can’t do that.
---
People can wipe your raid by dying to kazzak. How is it good design? It is not, but it has been solved a decade ago in retail.
---
People can steal your herbs, nodes quest objects, rares, mobs from you. How is it fair? It is not. Retail have solved it as well with shared herbs, shared mobs, shared quests etc.
---
In retail you can group up with 2 friends for arena and no one will grief you by being afk. Or just go to rated battlegrounds 10v10. You won’t get griefers.
---
I am not saying you to go to retail, just that classic is a flawed game. You either like it or not. Seems like you don’t like it always. Neither me. Complaining about classic mechanisms is pointless, because that is a 15 year old game and issues have been already solved on retail.
---
You, a horde warlock complains about paladins? How bad are lol
---
No changes
---
Sorry but I like PvP, I got most battlegrounds achievements and titles on retail. Not because I was fixated on them. People that play AV as in a huge battlefield aren't playing it correctly.
---
First off, if you're stuck in a tug of war, upgrade your damn troops, call in the wind riders, make sure the windriders of each bunker or tower makes it safe to your home so they can put up some wyvern/gryphon bombers there.
---
I feel like people who only think of AV being a massive 40 vs 40 are wrong. You need to upgrade troops, call in reinforcements, decide what you want to defend or attack. Escort NPC's to your base. There's more to AV than it just being a hillsbrad counterpart.
---
Ok boomer
---
Best rewards from av rep gg
---
Troll post from someone who will never break rank 10
---
Raid log and logging raids are two different things. "Raid log" is only logging in for raids, then straight out again after the raid.
---
Logging raids is what you're probably talking about, provide parses on Warcraft logs.
---
"In retail everything is handed to you"
---
"*proceeds to play AV for easy rep and rewards*"
---
You can use the option window to turn off all the icons, and turn them on if you need it. Without relogging.
---
Wow, 4:3 in 2019, that's pretty funny.
---
As for the brightness, none of the other screenshots in this thread look this bright, so it's pretty safe to assume that the gamma is high on your end.
---
Actually where they can go? I am all for finishing av in 8 mins, but where they go? Wsg where every enemy team is 5+ men premade? And to where? There is nothing else. At least on pve realm. On pvp you can go out and hunt people who don’t want to be ganked. It is not always fun for everyone. Someone likes to kill people with somewhat equal forces (40v40) or kill them when they consented (joined to the bg), not when they are trying to level or farm.
---
The attunements were a big part of that for sure as well, although they later on removed the SSC and TK attunements in order to make catching up easier you definitely needed to attune new recruits a fair bit until that point.
---
Like I said the most valuable items are usually things like trinkets and weapons.
---
From SSC you would probably want the spirit trinket for priests from the lurker below, as well as the holy paladin libram.
---
Tsunami talisman is another trinket from leotheras the blind which basically every melee DPS wants, and you don't typically get very many of those. Leotheras also drops a caster DPS sword which is decent if you haven't been lucky on T6 weapon drops.
---
FLK drops another trinket which is BiS for I believe fire mages and elemental shamans up until Sunwell.
---
Morogrim Tidewalker drops a trinket for mages which is basically required for them to switch their talent spec from fire to arcane(arcane mages also need 2 pieces of the T5 armor which they will keep forever, but those are quite easy to get).
---
Morogrim also drops a sword that is BiS for combat rogues, again weapons are usually quite hard to get so even if you're doing MH you probably still want to be killing that boss.
---
For the last boss of SSC which is Lady Vashj, she drops a healing mace which is depending on whether ZA is out or not, BiS for shamans until Illidan Stormrage, it's also very good for other healers.
---
She also drops a bow for hunters which is nice to have until your guild has both archimonde and illidan on farm, but I think that the most valued item from Vashj is the leather belt with expertise on it which is highly wanted for several melee classes and is BiS until Sunwell.
---
For the other T5 raid which is Tempest Keep, you want to make sure that you at least kill solarian for the DPS warrior trinket (it makes Battle Shout give more attack power to everyone it affects) which is very valuable for your DPS warrior to have because it boosts the damage of all your other melee in the raid.
---
Void Reaver drops a trinket that is specific to rogues, but its their BiS and gives their attacks a chance to ignore armor for 15 seconds and they basically need to have it.
---
Kael'thas has a couple of rather nice items that are still useful even if your guild is in Black Temple as well.
---
Your guild should also probably keep doing Gruul (a T4 boss and only takes around 20 minutes to do from a T6 level guild so it's quite easy to fit in every week) because he drops DST which is a melee DPS trinket and highly wanted by basically everyone, but you typically don't get enough drops to give it to every person so you're going to be killing the boss most likely until Sunwell comes out and eats all your time.
---
WSG is very good honor if:
---
* You are alliance so your queues are instant
---
* You are an above average premade stomping PUGs 3-0 in 8 minutes all day long
---
And the reason why single individuals don't queue WSG is:
---
* Premades aren't queued against other premades but instead steamroll your PUG games 24/7
---
* WSG doesn't have free honor and free rep objectives like AV, if you don't cap a flag you don't get anything
---
* You just can't match the honor gains if you're not in a premade
---
* Bad incentives = absurd queue times
---
there's a difference between 5 players defending key positions and 40 people sitting in a choke outside their base
---
Paladin hunter. All of the healing and melee dmg utility. All of the ranged dmg and snares or gap closing. Also a pet
---
It would be one thing if people blasting through the rep grind did it because they "enjoyed" it, but we know they didn't.... they did it just to get the rep and move on.
---
I've seen premades end with that much. They kill everything like horde does but wins.
---
Haha, hey, look at this idiot! Just stopping by to laugh at your dumbass post! Thanks for the laugh!
---
Prat
---
This is the only response that hasn't been stupid.
---
On average the last days I've done 3k honor per game, roughly 10min games, making it 18k an hour = 124k in 7h. This is a rough estimate as horde-gehennas EU solo queing tho!
---
this only really works if you're alliance.
---
The thing you're describing at the bottom, auto attacks turned off, is not possible in bgs since the newest patch. Reckoning is now basically useless
---
Why should I stop?  The idiot min/maxers pester everyone in raids about how they could get 1 more dps if they would just spend an additional 4 hours pre-raid to collect buffs for fucking mc ffs.  They don't stop, and are encouraged to be elitist douchebags - especially around here it seems.
---
Depends on your server and the ranking bracket you get placed in. 100k honor/day puts you in bracket 11 on my server. The highest rank you can get being in this bracket is R12.
---
Our first week we met up with another guild to clear. They got a staff of dominance.
---
What is roughly the value of "[The 1 Ring](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8350/the-1-ring)"? I'm trying to sell it, but none appeared at AH in a while and have no clue about the target price.
---
how are the queues on horde ? on ally 24/7 its insta
---
Have you noticed how few healers there are cause 25% of AV is warrior/mage? Other healers need water as well.
---
Not to mention that top got a lot bigger because everyone and their mother is a "L33T streamer boi" or "the best at pvp".
---
Was 2mins first day.  Was around 4ish the next.  Think its averaging around 8ish now.  Needless to say not great.  This is why I made an ally alt for PvP though and I finished my exalted grind for my war so I am all set.
---
Imagine having a vocabulary.
---
Well, it wasn't useless if you used a macro. They fixed that
---
Nothing worse than healing a dual wield fury tank.
---
*But we kill things so much faster.*
---
Yeah, and then I have to drink after every pull, adding 20+ minutes to the instance.
---
This isn't a druid thing, it's a healer thing. Why should a healer waste their mana healing a selfish mage?
---
I solo healed a Vanndar kill last night by doing exactly this. With a competent healer and tank you can really do some work. A little communication goes a long way.
---
Generally a good way to go but those numbers (AEP/MAEP) are very much generalizations. If you join the rogue classic discord you can use one of the spreadsheets there to get more accurate information.
---
Why would he block
---
Not venting or griping
---
For pvp I’m gonna say spinal reaper &gt; TUF.
---
Although I don’t play enh shamans so I don’t know that much. However, more top end damage and overall dps seems nice. 
---
TUF is still phenomenal and your second best option. Reaper is super duper rare and will likely go to a warrior over an enh shaman that’s getting a HoR
---
I've been playing a lot of wsg/ first time leveling a druid to 60. I have 12.7k armor atm and with a couple good heals I fear no melee. However, pom mages, locks and spriests in particular can cut me down to size real fast. What are the best items to mitigate frost and shadow damage while running flags, besides the usual reflectors?
---
I think I had 2 losses in like 20 games yesterday. The Horde in my cluster is absolutely hopeless.
---
You were almost right until you majorly downplayed the value of additional hit before being critcapped at the end there. While it's true that crit is more valuable than hit when you are below the critcap and above the minimum amount of required hit, the difference is far from "quite good" and "useless". They remain comparable with crit having the slight edge.
---
Lol, and there we have it. Other people's fun is wrong and bad.
---
What wouldn't
---
&gt; What did the moron do with your reed?
---
used it as a bong
---
How did you get it? Guild run or pug run?
---
I don't think it's just about the raw ilvl, it's the psychological component. Titanforging makes it so my character never feels conplete, and it becomed exhausting. In Everquest or classic wow i can say, "I'm done". Then i have my alts, pvp, etc...
---
I have not tested it myself but i have a few thoughts on what could be wrong.
---
Have you used perception in world before and after blizzard changed range and how logs detect stuff to nerf spy addon?
---
They might have fucked it up in that patch.
---
It could be a matter of lag in world as the world is bigger than instanced bg. As it works if a rogue stands still.
---
Or as you mentioned it could be the view distance.
---
But Fury Prot DW can't work, right guys? Guys?
---
What? Where do the 0.4 % hit per point of weapon skill come from?
---
Against bosses (lvl 63 with Defense skill of 315) you need 9 % hit to be capped. With +5 weapon skill, which effectively reduces the Defense rating vs you to 310, the needed hit reduces to 6 %. 3/5 = 0.6 % per hit. Ever point in weapon skill after that only gets you 0.1 % to hit. So that means 5 points in weapon skill increases the chance to hit by 0.5 %.
---
So vs. a same level mob, you still need 5 % hit.
---
Kind of looks like a ballerina
---
Bg's won't solve all the problems. I did the same thing already in Vanilla. The pvp servera as a whole, are much more toxic. The only reason I joined pvp server this time, was because my coworkers had joined there already. But they quit the whole game, so I transferred, because I still remembered how much better pve servers were back then. I rather do my pvp in bg, than have have some level 60 teenage boy ganking my alts, so that he can feel better about himself.
---
It's totally random, just got out of a fight against 3 warriors and not once did reckoning proc, sometimes I'd die, res up and hit someone with full stacks out of nowhere, I don't get it
---
On my server, Razergore EU i saw 2 of them for almost 200g on the AH at the same time. It was a week or two ago. I really dont think  anyone actually bought them though. IMO it seems more like a meme ring than something useful
---
I am loving it AV queues are 3 mins and Horde wins most AV thanks
---
If you right click the minimap icon for the que, you can select enter bg there. Works for me!
---
cant skin crocs, can you?
---
This.Game is about fun.Defending against Horde of alliance and pvping is mega fun
---
what about Non-Human Alliance with Edgemaster's and using Perdition's Blade / Brutality Blade combo? Worth it?
---
That's fair
---
Yeah, it's really elitist if you want to be prepared for a raid, lol.
---
If you’re saying that 2.0 AS has a lower dps than 1.2 AS (not counting frenzy ofc) then you’re super mistaken. 
---
Pet damage per hit scales with their attack time/swing speed. Largely it’s very irrelevant for pve, somewhat matters with frenzy. Matters in PvP due to caster kickback.
---
Cats &gt; owls because cats do more dps and scale better with frenzy. Owls are better at aoe threat thanks to screech though.
---
You don’t need to slow down for honor and lengthen games. The most efficient farm is doing all commanders and Lts and finishing in 7-8 mins.
---
We farmed Av for about 5 hours. 6-7 minutes per game with Balinda and lieutenants. 110 000 honor
---
Mages are scum.
---
Do a /wave. Ask their pronouns. Ask if’s ok to pvp. 
---
Lol social rules wtf bro
---
I'm not 100% sure but I think you need bracket 13
---
Atleast you have a shot at winning those premades. The real pvpers are stuck doing pve till they got gear

---
so as im understanding it, shit's fucked, they fixed the /startattack /stopattack thing, only benefit being that we should save reckoning charges when crit while out of range
---
well, time to go fully holy i guess
---
I grinded AV for about 12 yours one day got 500hk and only 100k honour... but I need exalted rep for that cheaper epic mount so I'm not too fussed.
---
I thinking about this for some time now, do people get used to it quickly?
---
I was hesitant because I keyboard turn all the time actually (obviously not in a PvP scenario or similar, but while eating or smoking or stuff on autorun and think it's way more convenient than using mouse while half afk)
---
What macro might that be? Mind to share?
---
In my experience its the total unwillingness of the alliance to defend that is costing a lot of wins.
---
As others have said in this thread, the meta has begun to shift. More and more often, the horde are attempting to slow down and disrupt the alliance zerg before they get to galv/drek. They're also sending people back to harass the alliance while they're pulling warmasters.
---
In contrast, after balinda, the horde usually have an open and undefended alliance base, nobody recaps stormpike graveyard, nobody recaps dun baldar bunkers, nobody harasses them as they kill marshals.
---
If you're one of the alliance whining in chat about how the game has dragged on and "just let them win", you're incentivising the horde to defend and get easy win.
---
But regrowth and rejuv are extremely expensive heals already not really worth downranking for most players. If you want to be a somewhat decent raid healer who doesnt oom in 10 secs moomglow and ns is the way to go. Just spamming downranked plus healing touch with the occasional hot. Swiftmend is useless there. Multiple druids hots doesnt stack anyway and there might be a few other druids hoting making it even more useless throwing it on.
---
What else are you going to do with your time exactly? One time per week you have to put a *little* effort into the game, is it that much too ask for you to be prepared for that? Nobody is asking you to collect consumables for the entire week, the most you have to collect is a few potions and DM buffs. DM buffs take like 15 minutes maybe and potions you can buy, so how do you arrive at 4 hours of prep-time exactly?
---
Hit exalted with stormpike guard, by doing AV battlegrounds. Then you can buy it from the vendor in alterac mountains. It takes very roughly 100 AV matches, can be done by playing a couple of hours each day for a couple of weeks.
---
Machines are taking over. They are even playing the games so we don't have to!
---
You can solo the bunkers, btw. As a Horde Rogue I tend to just rush north right at the start w/ mount gear (facetanking the Archers at the Bunker you ride past), use the backdoor, stealth before I get aggro from the Archers, then solo both bunkers. One of the bunkers you need to Sap an Archer and then cap, the other you can LOS all of them.
---
If they are not in combat when you cap the flag, they get despawned.
---
Fuck me this guys voice.
---
But still yesterday i had luck on ppl, that i lost 95% games during 7h session (many of them were games for 30+min). Today i looked on honor tab and i received same honor as Day1 with 95% wins during 3hours. So if you premade wsg, i guess it is more safe honor than rng pug in AV.
---
Or just kill him and get the honor
---
Nothing forces you into AV *yet* and for the foreseeable time.
---
It's even being down voted lol!
---
If you're 25 points into Prot for Reckoning, is it really Ret?
---
Nolifers such as myself are also already exalted, so it can be done quite quickly if one wants to
---
Old one tho 😂
---
Nothing wrong with min/maxing culture, untill it becomes standard meta and non minmaxers are punished.
---
Curious, how does this work? What do you have to do to find a mob with Mind Vision?
---
better than av pve afk turtle shit
---
As horde - I have won 1, lost 22.... This is fun.
---
“Stuck”
---
You are mistaken. On private servers with pre-nerf AV, the ranking meta was premade WSG. Pre-need AV actually requires mines, etc.
---
Dkp and Ive always identified as spellhunter
---
Yup you are correct
---
Noon on a weekday?
---
I'd say go on a balanced pvp server so you dont regret later not having the option to open world pvp.
---
That could be it, too.
---
I haven't faced any solo Rogues in world PVP since that update. I'll try again with my guildy later.
---
Druids aren't locked in heal roll at endgame at all. Bears are the best offtank in  the game and tank most of the boss just fine. And when a raid need more dps to fill the slots they won't care if you are a boomkin
---
? what do you mean? it's BIS for hpriest.
---
Y, my experience is Galv = Loss
---
What u describe i encountered once, which is that one win i had yesterday :-(
---
Cant get, why ppl doesnt realize that certain win is better than 125 rep from galv IF we r fast enough which is...never.
---
It is good honor, but not comparable to AV. Even the best premades will still get less honor/hr in WSG than AV. WSG is around 18k/hr and AV is 24k/hr—both rough numbers from very good premades (alliance side).
---
Which server is that? My servers hopping 24/7. We even got a healthy pop in thunder bluff
---
What’s the rate on it?
---
lolwat? I said that he knew it was the 1.12 patch for the past two years. You can't say the patch accounts for 25% of Vanilla's life-span when WoW Classic isn't supposed to be a recreation of 'Vanilla'. It's a recreation of World of Warcraft 1.12, as they've made clear from the day they re-visited the earliest possible version that would work.
---
"Fake news", lol.
---
Mark my words. Loot RNG is bugged similar to how Onyxia and Rag were bugged.
---
I have seen more raids with 2+ toeps than raids with 1 toep.
---
Normally this is laughable and confirmation bias. But with the nature of bugs that made it through testing, IMO the burden of proof is on Blizzard.
---
I’m certainly not buying the RNG is unbugged. My pug’s rng has been so ridiculously good, I am not buying it.
---
I feel like once I see Lucifron and Magmadar loot, that the rest of the drops are super predictable. It is the same in every dungeon.
---
I come from a background in data analysis so I know how ridiculous what I say sounds and that no anecdote would make the claim legitimate. But it is really worth looking into IMO.
---
0 minute queues on horde, eh?
---
You can easily get in the same one as your friends just synchronise your queueing - it works more often than not.
---
I would rather lose than play a drawn out game
---
Say that to the alliance of Flamelash
---
He ran from behind me through to my front, I think.  Like I said I couldn't see him, I just told him to run through me :P
---
But I've definitely caught Rogues coming at me from behind while ressing in AV. I sometimes spin my character around while casting, but I distinctly remember at least one time I saw him coming fast enough that I cancelled the cast and cast Judgement on him (which can be cast in 360 degrees)
---
Yes.
---
yup
---
Hello there,
---
Can you tell me the name of your addon that shows loot rolls?
---
I think thrash blade and Mirahs Song is best but that might have changed with the release of AV/WSG
---
Ahh well, thanks for checking. My guildie is not using elvui though. So it might be an issue with the wow patch then.
---
Good and water are unaffected indeed. Just spells that require a reagent
---
You knew horde was gonna be the Zerg side - everyone was saying that alliance would have insta queue and horde would get fucked.  This was long before classic launched and was fucking obvious to anyone paying attention too.  This is why real pvpers went alliance.
---
They aren’t punished, they are forced to play with like-minded players. It’s wrong to expect to be accepted with open arms by a community that plays differently than you do.
---
Debetable about bis, but one of top items yes
---
So I'm playing around with a level 10 alt warrior.
---
Everything I read about "levelling a warrior" talks about 30+ or so.
---
I want to tank RFC. What should I look for in a weapon or otherwise know?
---
About Spy. For a time, I would use Perception and click the Rogues name on the Spy list while spamming Judgement or Holy Shock, but that was never more effective than targeting the player model.
---
Since BG's were released I've disabled Spy altogether. I always felt like I had to use it in the weeks of World PVP, but never liked having it.
---
100k honour is like 5 hours of AV on alliance?  Don’t even need a premade.
---
What does that mean and what tricks are there to get a higher rank? (Besides doing more damage obviously) I'm a healer and always on first or second spot in our logs but would be interesting to know tho
---
Stonespine is the worst server on EU hands down, it's like 30-70 horde favored.
---
Nah that would still be THE TOP 0.01% feral dps on his legendary parse. I wish it was boomkin though.
---
Yes it's true, solo levelling fighting 1 mob you should do this. In instances you probably want to build rage for SS + Cleave x2 instead, or SS + WW. In my experience you don't quite generate enough rage that you can afford to sink rage in between.
---
Not a nerf is a fix. Use the correct words instead of wording it like a clickbait site
---
That all sounds very positive, thanks!
---
Healers should say before the run that they are going to be needing on that
---
I wouldnt join a run that they are
---
40 minute game and they're not trying? Hmm
---
WSG was the go to place for honour in Vanilla, not AV. The rushing AV has changed that.
---
On a PvE server, if I have one character each on horde and alliance, is it against ToS to send gold between my characters using the Booty Bay auction house by selling gray items for a very high price on one character and buying it on the other? I know theres a large tax on the neutral AH, but is it allowed?
---
Most people are still farming AV exalted and rank 10, or higher.
---
*Heals*
---
*gets aggro from 4 mobs*
---
*all the dps proceed to either walk off or only dps one target at a time*
---
What addon shows the colors of each class in the chat?
---
There are a lot of lieutenants and commaders walking around and defending objectives in AV. Each of them gives 198 honor on kill, and since it's just one elite, you can just round them up and smack them down.
---
A great 5 man tanking build is 16/15/20
---
Arms: 5 parry, 2 (or 3) HS, 1(or 2) charge, 2(or none depending on how you allocate points) TC, 5 into tactical mastery, 1 anger management
---
Fury: 5 cruelty, 5 unbridled wrath, 5 imp battle shout (more ap, more threat)
---
Prot: 5 shield spec, 5 toughness, 5 defiance, 3 imp sunder, 2 imp taunt
---
If you don't want 17 into arms you can use the other 2 points for imp bloodrage or use one point for piercing howl and the other point for bloodrage.
---
I personally like the 3/2 sunder/hs because it makes rage management that much easier.  I sometimes go 2 points into thunderclap but honestly it's probably better just to go 2 into charge since you can charge for the bonus rage then TC as your opener.  Then again, you can't always charge pull so it's kind of a toss up.
---
Tanking with at least defiance will make life a ton easier once you start grouping with folks that put out some major dps.  But if you're going to spend the 15 in prot anyway you might as well spend 5 more on sunder and taunt.
---
Did they not teach math in the schools where you grew up?
---
Ofc it is
---
Nope
---
So how about telling us wich server then?
---
Back in Vanilla we had to organise AV on the forums, might get it once or twice a day. Waiting 10mins is nothing.
---
A and D (not S) instead of Q and E. And yes, you'll get used to it quickly, because pressing Q and E will now not move you anymore and will instead make you use a spell/cooldown. 
---
You can still keyboard turn with your arrow keys if you want to.
---
I'm confused at why this is NSFW
---
It certainly gets you a ton of darnassus rep as well seeing how 25% or so of your rep in SW also translates to Darnassus.
---
In a 30 minute AV I got about 800-1000 OG rep. Which is like 40 stacks of runecloth.
---
jo horde - tab stoneheart graveyard.
---
Its snowfall what you dont wanna tab.
---
dont get confused.
---
Looks like a Tauren to me
---
For AV, As horde, are you not entering some games that are turtle?
---
As alliance we can check the game before enter and if it is not fresh we just requeue for instant new game
---
As Horde you have ti requeue
---
Y I K E S bro
---
I tried it with the yeti, did get reset immediately by the clearer! Don't do that :(
---
&gt;like doing pvp
---
Do you also play pvp with zero consumables or pots?
---
&gt;other things that are actually fun
---
Like what? You aren't doing dungeons for your pre-raid gear, you arent farming mats and you aren't interested in topping the meters during raids. What exactly do you do while you're ingame?
---
Also: isn't raiding one of the most fun parts of the game? I would even say it's the only fun pve-part of the game, cause the other parts of the game are 100% braindead and RPing is pretty dead.
---
Yes, when it works out. Many times in raid situations you'll find that tank either needs emergency healing faster so you'll use swiftmend after only 1 tick of your hot or when its ticked 3 times, its just topped off the tank all 3 ticks and he is full hp. The situation are just worse for healing dps and healers in the raid. On top of that you need to use reju or regrowth to actually be able to use swiftmend in a raid, of which both are way less mana effective than ht4. Using swiftmend to end them early by wasting 1 or more ticks makes them less mana effective than they already are.
---
Back in the day I wanted to be the server first Warlock with Thunderfury. I was soloing it from Wrath. 
---
Took well over a year to drop in the end. Ofc I went in on my priest and got a binding 3rd run. Went on my Paladin and got both in about 10 weeks.
---
Nope, first Mageblade for that guild.  Congrats, Turtles!
---
But what happens in BGs? You want Spy visible there, but you also really should have raid frames.
---
solo players shouldn't be rewarded. They're there for premades to stomp. HURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
Meta is starting to change now that people are exalted.
---
Most groups im in now rush Galv and kill the LTs around there before running to Drek.
---
Usually end up with ~2500 honor for wins now.
---
Queue for one of the top avs on the list
---
13 IDs, not a single priest shoulders. At least a binding.
---
Actually there’s a meme arcane shot build... it’s actually retry powerful since the scaling of arcane shot is really good. On a full set you can easily hit a 400+ damage non crit arcane shot, which is also instant, 41 range, and goes through armour.
---
Not to mention if it crits, it behaves like a physical crit so it’s bugged by hunters crit talent, making it crit over 1000.
---
Yes, which is doable, since plenty of AV matches end in less than 10 minutes.
---
there is hope:  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/proof-for-fixing-changes-to-the-talent-reckoning/388589](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/proof-for-fixing-changes-to-the-talent-reckoning/388589)

The best bit is how they made him patrol around a house that cuts your draw distance inconsistently when you go near it.
---
I've seen many sshadow priests with Firelord chokers, spellpower rings and/or talismans of ephemeral power lately.
---
Only works for alliance.
---
raids in classic lasts hours?
---
Her fireball sorts the players by threat, and goes through that list top to bottom, pushing everyone to the bottom of the list.
---
Instead of sorting that list by the amount of threat, it had been sorted by a played’s GUID (Global Unique ID), which is a fancy word of saying “sorted by your character’s creation time”.
---
It was actually possible to have Onyxia get stuck in a loop, where she would keep fireballing the same target over and over again.
---
This is much like a bug, that would naturally occur in an implementation of RNG. A random number generator needs an input. A so-called seed. That seed has to be unique enough. You can achieve that by having a counter that counts up every raid. Or use a time stamp. Or... *cough*... accidentally your GUID. Because seeds are usually a combination of things, to ensure they are unique enough.
---
It would easily be possible, that Blizzard would mix up a GLOBAL UID with a RAID ID/UID.
---
It’s tricky. These bugs are pretty easy to cause. Why this usually scuffed at is out brains are just so bad with “randomness”. Just look at the amount of paradoxes that emerge from this like the birthday paradox.
---
Many mp3 playeds had RNG implementations that felt buggy but weren’t. Even though I could swear they kind of shuffled my playlists in the same order.
---
&gt;I'm guessing it somehow got ~~ninja~~ master looted to him when he spent all his dkp on it. Both epics are from  Golemagg, so he probably just ~~yoinked them both for the memes~~ spent his dkp on that boss's drops. 
---
Fixed!
---
Looks like a trash bid next to a mudhut.
---
Im pretty sure arcane shot crits like a normal crit, so hunters don’t need spell crit. It’s a weird skill that scales with magic power but crits like a normal crit
---
Sounds lovely. Shame such a beautiful efficient design must be infested with gnomes. Maybe one day, when the land is cleansed of life I’ll have the change to see it
---
So once you get epic robe drop tailoring?
---
Hell yes! Congrats!
---
Cyka blyat
---
tell me how much fun people have in av doing pve content.
---
Easiest thingnin the world for ranged to do - they have max 6k hp
---
You still want 6%even if you're orc/human with racial weapon type. 2% from Lionheart helm, 1% from Ony neck, 1% from AV ring, 1% from black dragon set. You still need 1% more. And you also want to leave some room for future upgrades, like Flameguard gloves (so no devilsaur) or Wristguards of stability (so no Battleborn vambraces). So it's basically either Brigham girdle or Satyr's bow.
---
Chill out kiddo (⌐■_■)
---
Thank you! It was a long grind, and many many dungeon runs, but I finally got it! :D
---
nash equilibrium
---
Yep but it is marginal
---
For mages especially that trinket is big upgrade until rare MC drops
---
Priests Locks Druids etc get similar from DM
---
It's been 25-35min queue times for Horde in OCE last couple nights, so the longer fights are much more beneficial
---
The big lie is that wow is a "solved game". Anything that contradicts that belief will get shoved down the memory hole. For example, do a google search for moonkin bis.
---
I think it would’ve been better if they launched old av for ahwhile, then patch it later to the new one. Going through the patches could be considered “the classic experience” anyway
---
you didn't say anything productive. you just hurled personal attacks while using a thesaurus.
---
Yeah we've had 2 drop in one run, with another the next week, nutty rng.
---
When does the Winter Veil event start on Classic servers?
---
It's pretty easy. 
---
Be sure to have friendly nameplates enabled. Bring mana pots and demonic runes (runes not required but help). Bring a few oil of immolation and or strat water - also not required but can really help. If you want to do it real safe bring a bear with thorns on him and make him stand before the cave entrance and tell him to not do anything including moving. He will tank all the adds and kill them with his thorns which makes the whole quest completely trivial. But even doing it properly it's pretty easy she will take 2 trys max and will most likely do it first try. I nearly managed to do it the first time without having nameplates at all when I enabled them second try it was a Breeze.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
Cool cool.  So does this mean Horde are skipping Belinda?  Or are you defending her, wiping them, then she's around to kite the elites to her?
---
Wow never even crossed my mind that I can still use arrow keys. As I said I keyboard turn often but only in trivial situations and don't want to miss that but arrow keys work fine obviously, simple! Thanks will change as soon as I'm on my computer.
---
I had the yeti up the whole time, was not an issue.
---
How do I get Lei of the Lifegiver? Can't find any rep/other requirements online
---
Its a huge upgrade for them, they will also use the DM one if their other trinket is on cd as it has a 30min one.
---
We pull all the surrounding lieutenants and commanders to Balinda, either kill them outside her house or just drag them in and kill them with her. It's rarely defended by more than a couple of alliance anyway.
---
That is not the average amount a person would get.. if you just solo your win rate will be 50-50 (probably, over a large sample size) so you will get abysmal honor when you only win 50% of the time
---
Yeah and karma for everyone else on horde that didn’t camp menethil or FPs!
---
`/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"`
---
Send PP
---
Perfect, thanks
---
Thanks for all that info.
---
I've [written code to deal with bad RNG](https://github.com/technion/matasano_challenge/blob/master/set3/chal24/chal24b.rb) so this is pretty interesting to me.
---
So what item should they join the run to get?
---
Is that class color on the name bar? Which addon for that?
---
That's how you know it's fake
---
With queues that number is down to 10k an hour = 70k after 7h.
---
This was so useful up until zf or so, it's insane. Perfectly lines up if no resists.
---
No you cant since you max rank caps out before that. And you Will never get egough honor on a twink to get the top percentile
---
Anyone can be a herbalist. Picking flowers while watching streams paid for my epic mount in no time at all.
---
It’s just like vanilla.  Sounds like you thought you did but you didn’t?
---
I thought most of the discussion was whether clearing before 1st reset was possible.  I think the majority of random people (and myself) figured it was more likely to be done easily before 2nd reset (like 10days).  Didn't really account for how fast people could level dungeon spamming I guess, especially with the raid bug.
---
You count down and everyone joins first available at the same time and call out what #, you keep doing it until you all have same game.
---
We’ve been clearing MC since September and we haven’t seen a single Ring of Spellpower drop.
---
But we have two bindings...
---
Why does horde always lose AV?
---
Elite named mobs. For example outside of Balinda's bunker there are 3 Lieutenants on mounts you can kill if you are horde. 2 right in front and one NE a little further back. Worth 198 honor each I believe.
---
If all races had a unique class that only they could play, wtf would the human be? Everyone else is really obvious
---
I joke as a resto shaman that I have the magical ability to summon rogues out of thin air. All I need to do is spam a few chain heals and Bam! Works every time.
---
Those guys probably sit 6 hours a day in any capital city and wonder why they are still riding 60%...
---
What about their worst 20 players lol.
---
I followed this:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJu7KIh8Wws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJu7KIh8Wws)
---
Mainly for the spell downranking. The thing that caught me out was that the previous wave just stands at the end for a while and the next wave will have spawned and start dying if you babysit the first wave.
---
Personally I used only mana potions and oil of immolation, but I'm very well geared and using a Disc PI spec.
---
The worst part of the quest is the cost of the Eye of Shadow tbh....
---
Pretty great for those going for ranks. Can take break per match instead of breaking backs
---
Great night for the locks!
---
They don't need to release the spirit.
---
This is the AV we should have had.
---
9 out of 10 games are finished as a victory in 7 minutes, it’s not even worth trying to do anything else. Horde is just pathetic.
---
But we’re starting to get the picture.
---
I routinely see 5 or so Ally sticking back to defend FW Gy and cutting off any horde from screwing everyone and wiping the group at Drek, thereby turning a 10 minute match into a 30+ minute one for only a tiny fraction of additional honor.
---
I use Prat. https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/prat-3-0
---
Exalted w/ AV faction. It's like 45g
---
Galv gives same honor as a lieutenant if killed before Balinda.
---
I got it within 10 kills on my first.  
---
I didn't get it after about 40 on my 2nd and went on with another Quest
---
What is this an image of? What addon/UI part please?
---
Onyxia is pretty comfortable even with sub-20.  It is definitely slower but not hard by any stretch.
---
I'm pretty sure that's the reason for the high tax
---
at least he has 5k+ armour in moonkin form
---
Ahh okay, thank you! Looks like I guess run AV a lot :(
---
Not true I was just doing av premades with a bunch of rankers on faerlina alliance that got exalted day 1. Premades efficiently killing galv, lt's and capping gy's we win 95%+ and get 2.5K+ honor per match. It's the best honor for allies right now cause pug av's don't anywhere near the honor per hour.
---
as a shadow priest, this is my specialty
---
Are you geared?? I’m half pre raid bis atm with no robes yet
---
back in Asheron's Call we had portal bots, auction bots; as you had to buy and sell from players directly; and of course bots that farmed locations.
---
  
---
the auction bots were so popular but subject to griefing if placed wrong that the development team made them a special location with an adjacent room useful for portal bots. Some portal bots were totally free to use but most accepted donations of in game currency or items. Advanced versions could drop junk if people tried to overload them with such.   
---
I love AC's portal system, you could bind to nearly any portal and recall to it with the correct spell and many of the same portals allowed you to summon them for others. No need to be in parties to use them
---
Love the stronghold music! Nice touch!
---
Just make sure your main hand is updated every couple levels for a fast experience.

Some people weren't too happy about this :D
---
i also like to be on defense as a spriest
---
Just had a WSG against a super geared undead warrior. My human warlock friend was upset. 
---
Undead warrior is for people who are not afraid of anything.
---
And they do suck and as a healer you can't do anything about it
---
No, it's 5.5 % vs lvl 61 and 5 % vs lvl 60
---
Below level 60 I don't know. It could continue with 0.5 % per level, could be 1 % per level or even 2% per level, as it was suggested. I just don't know and a very quick Google search did not give me any results.
---
Congratulations tae ye!
---
Tell him to specc soul link, its not so good for wsg, but (at least every 15 minutes) you dumpster all physical damage classes.
---
Once I got the DM trinket I stopped going for briarwood. The second wind isn’t as good for straight healing but I don’t have to farm it.
---
Make them into steel bars then sell.
---
as an alliance player all i can say is: haHA \*nelsonvoice\*
---
Next time dont pick a resource that isnt end tier to flip
---
He could have it set to local time. These pictures could've been taken at the middle of the night.
---
You are objectively wrong.
---
and other runs will give you 2k in 8 min... theres smth wrong
---
People would absolutely quit if it was only ok your server. They would quit after being stomped by the same team again and again.
---
People have said everyone will quit time and time again. Give it up. People will quit no matter what.
---
4 Onslaughts for our guild so far
---
There must surely be a list of OP BoE's to prepurchase. Not like It's the first time someone is leveling a rogue alt.
---
But they do, though. As a resto sham in mail and a shield I've noticed that I take less damage from elites than the majority of warriors. And you can *always* spot those leather shoulders :P
---
51-59 still face 60s in AV
---
Why would I want the opinion of someone who didn't play the same game everyone else did? His experience has no relation to my classic experience.
---
I never complain when the game gives me reason to grind mobs.
---
I'd rather kill 1000 zhevra for hoofs, atleast I have a reason other than "I quested too fast and need to kill trash for an entire level"
---
&gt; no
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; there are 2 acceptable raiding specs. combat swords and combat daggers
---
&gt; fully geared in nax stuff you can make SF work but combat is still better
---
sub rogue is perfectly fine. you're greatly overestimating wow's hardness.
---
Not really, just have a succ out and force trinket / racial with seduce.
---
You do realize the battleground is supposed to be a contest and not a trade exchange for efficient honor right?
---
Except with a less bullshit RNG system and no tokens
---
The only bad part of early legion was the fact that if you got 1~2 bad legiondaries it was mathematically faster to get the one you want by leveling another character from 1 to 110 and regearing yourself in M+  than it was to just continue on your existing character and hope the RNG gods bless you with a 3rd legiondary at all.
---
No because you can’t buy your own auctions on a pve server cross faction from the same account. 
---
So you’ll need a friend to help
---
I took to dropping Grace of Air totem pretty early on. Windfury only lasts as long as I do.
---
Better start recruiting Warlocks then. Can't imagine they'd stay.
---
Look for blue/purple weapons that are slow.  That’s pretty much it.
---
&gt;then start to complain that there is no content or no challenge.
---
Those people are also straight up wrong.
---
Gold farming takes time. Rep farm takes time. Gearing alts for alt raiding takes time. These are things you can do to optimize, but people think that once they clear MC in &lt;2 hours, the game is done until BWL comes out.
---
All the minmaxers I know arent complaining about no content, they're spending their days grinding thousands of gold for consumables for BWL and AQ.
---
Because when i get back, que popped.....
---
I just need the Lightforge Legplates still. Also the epic mount. Have the mats just need to do the quest now
---
Nice work! :)
---
why do meme spec mains get so defensive when faced with facts
---
That set becomes so strong when dungeon set 2 is released.
---
How/what is the fastest way to get exalted with frost wolf clan?
---
The way I've seen is that moon is usually sheep, and any other icon is used for wtfever other cc you got, usually star
---
30 minute queues
---
That's why it's hypothetical bud, feel like you are taking a make believe scenario a little to serious:)
---
Makes up for all the favoritism that horde have.. Their landscapes compared to ours are ridiculous. In alliance all the roads are curved , never really a straight path anywhere. *But my favorite is not being able to walk up little hills like the horde landscapes let you.* travel is time consuming.That's my biggest issue.
---
Why are throwing weapons so bad?
---
Which server and faction?
---
There's your problem. Find another source to farm and sell the Iron slowly. Only post a few stacks at a time.
---
Which means in any serious  decent guild you lose loot prio.
---
Go to shadow panther.net
---
I personally think full sets look awesome and I really appreciate when people wear them because so many just want to min/max
---
This x1000000
---
Had it drop in my pug last weekend, mages &amp; warlocks got pretty upset that a holy paladin won it.
---
Death coil broo
---
I popular clown streamer has no idea what the classic experience is, and I dont think he cares. No point of listening it.
---
Arms tank is decent though, not nearly as good as prot but at least it’s better than fury lol
---
I mean 26 in ret... Honestly reckoning should be a ret talent anyways.
---
It's painful to watch.
---
Instant queues all day.
---
5 7 min que ln dreadmist eu for horde... its very good... i can stretch refill drink reroll shit.. why the fuck is everyone in such a hurry in a god damn game? i mean dont you stress and hurry enough irl at work? chill the fuck out man
---
&gt; AV on this patch is fun as a PvE activity where the other faction is present.
---
This is honestly what I think AV should be, ideally.
---
Except rather than a boss rush it should be more heavily focused around gathering resources from various parts of the map in order to turn em into your giant.
---
Distribute the important shit far enough apart and it encourages clusters of 3~5 people fighting over like, ram meat or whatever, while rogues are able to roam and +1 small skirmishes or waylay stragglers and respawners.
---
&gt; if they are having fun by finding way to play the game as least as possible then i pity them
---
That doesn't apply to minmaxers in classic. More the casuals. The sweaty rank 14 minmaxers play 16-18 hours a day.
---
Why do people use ilvl addons in vanilla? ilvl doesn't mean anything.
---
I think you confused things when you said this part: 
---
&gt;which effectively reduces the Defense rating vs you to 310
---
We know it's 6% for orc vs level 63.. you just made it sound like the +5 orc racial magically brings the level 63 enemy down to 62 which is very confusing and may have confused yourself. So if it's 6% vs 63 and each level difference after that changes the hit needed by 0.5%, it's 5.5% at level 62... etc.
---
What?  I’m a priest and use DM and second wind.  How does that mean losing loot prio?
---
it's a joke
---
There is, but they’re called “heirlooms” and they won’t be available for another couple expansions yet.
---
Rogues kill stuff so quick you won’t need any uber gear to level, like a warrior would. Just buy agi/stam gear off the AH as you level and that’s all you should need to do. Once you hit level 13 you can wear most of the Defias set, and that gives some decent stats.
---
What's the point of farming that much honor?
---
BG’s are crossrealm though, he’s only getting queues because there are more horde players
---
F that, dkp is dkp. In a raid council ayayem, yes mageblade prios to mages because it's a bigger boost to mages then it is to locks at this point in game. But if you go dkp route then you commit to the dkp route.
---
As a shadow priest I can kill like 3 of them then I am oom and can’t get out of combat.
---
I shit with the door open and angle my mirror so I can see my computer screen.
---
/r/classicwow: "Minmaxers are bad and stupid because they try to dictate how you play the game!"
---
Also /r/classicwow: "If you minmax, you are playing the game wrong and hate fun!"
---
I never had any issues with this quest, my warrior I got it on 2 kill and my priest maybe the 4th or 5th. Same thing on the Pserver a month before launch. Maybe I’m just lucky.
---
Min/max or DIE!!!!
---
They've got more than that though, less armour since no plate gear, no tanking tier set (same problem as feral druids), warriors don't just have 1 taunt they have 3 different taunts and one is AoE, also no large defensive cooldown like Shield Wall
---
What about loot from those mobs ? any good ?
---
At least assembling the raid :P
---
Frostbite is better, only need revered in AV. Dont waste your money on AotDW!
---
&gt; But you need us to cooperate to mixmax, but fat chance ya'll don't have social skills.
---
Im not trying to rank or minmax myself but it's a pretty shitty take to throw out there nonetheless.
---
&gt; We wanna do rep quests, maybe punch alliance in the face in 1v1 skirmishes we've been craving since release (but have never gotten), 
---
AV is probably not the place if u craving 1v1's, WSG probably better.
---
&gt; and you calling us idiots aint going to get us to help you.
---
People from both sides get irrationally angry. I got death threats because I was standing on the battlemaster :^) wasn't on purpose but okay.
---
Get frostbite axe, its better than axe of the deep woods and only requires revered with AV (which doesnt take long at all).
---
Won 7 in a row last night. Ally can't win if they fail on the first push.
---
Farming honor/rep. This isnt a pvp bg
---
I just got my shadow craft shoulders last night!! Next up, chest in UBRS. Looking solid dwarf :-)
---
You are doing god's work good job, inb4 the witch hunt against chinese bots start
---
I had really bad times farming this trinket. Eventually i made a group full of rogues, hunters warriors, healers that didn’t need the trinket and fellow guildies that already had it, so item was practically reserved for me. After so many trys this was the only way of getting it.
---
Of course spamming “jed trinket ress” on world chat tilted many idiots, but now im happy with my bis.
---
It's legit a problem for oceanic servers.. we already have 25-30 minute av queues.
---
Which is why horde tries to win nowadays.
---
That itself seems to be the major problem. The gear is so good and locked behind AV rep. Funny they had that problem even in vanilla.
---
nothing to do with hardness, non combat specs do an inferior amount of damage
---
6 piece shadowcraft is really good
---
We got two last raid run
---
Ally IQ
---
Coordinate to click "join first available" at the same time and 2 out of 3 times you get the same number BG
---
You don’t realize a lot of people don’t care about honor and just want rep rewards and gtfo. 10
---
Minutes queues for a total time of 22 minutes per 200 rep loss is a brutal grind. Might as well try to make it a 30 minute, 1,1k rep win
---
Pve players prolly like it.
---
Nobody needs a flood of iron. Put in a few stacks each.
---
How about let's keep it the was it is so people who enjoy PvP can play WSG and those that want zu honor farm can play AV.
---
People who don’t play this game for fun should be banned for griefing. See, it sounds equally stupid when you take the opposite extreme position.
---
Some people don't feel joy in being tortured lol
---
Wrong 
---
And +29 is infinetly more than +0
---
Are you my guild? Like 4-5 mageblades and all our hunters have the leaf
---
To sell smart you cant put up large quantities of anything really or you will get undercut and your stuff might not sell. Sell it slowly overtime.
---
If they wanted AV to be a contest then they shouldn't have put in the massively nerfed 1.12 version.
---
You shouldnt ever really sell anything in mass quantities because of the likelihood it wont sell. Keep in mind everyone else doing the same thing as you, slightly undercutting. So after 30 mins theres going to be people undercutting you already if you have a mass of iron just sitting there at one price.
---
The best way is to sell it slow, like maybe 4 stacks at a time or else. That way you dont flood the market all at once and lower demand and prices. Its also less risk to sell them a few at a time because youll be risking less on tour deposits.
---
What is the add on show the buff/debuff times?
---
ah cry about it?
---
That's ruff
---
When AV first released and you actually had real war battles going on, the quests and bosses mattered and the game went on for 8 hours....it was tons of fun. But that's not the version of AV we got. We got the rep farm version so that a how people play.
---
If you are rolling for gear then stop bitching and keep rolling. If It’s loot council then that sounds bad.
---
And yet you keep losing to it :)
---
i'm new to WoW and trying to create the proper pvp mage. currently a frost spec mage but realized some of my talents were more pve based which i don't have much use for atm. i reset my talents and am looking for a proper build
---
I need your water to buff you and by the way I pay for that buff also in silvers. Also I heal you. I always tip mages for water when I ask them for that in cities or whatever. If we are in the same group soon the same thing like instance or BG I am not asking you for your time and wate so I can go my way, you just contribute to your group. Charging people for water in the same group is ridiculous.
---
Follow directions haha who do you think you are? Armchair war general
---
He was, but as you said, its not that great for WSG in general. He really loves soul link. :3
---
Get out.  A loot council can work but it has to be fair and impartial.  This just sounds like a clique of mates running a guild for their own benefit and dishing out the loot between them.
---
If you can't find a guild you can trust with loot council, go for one with a DKP system - if you're a consistent contributor then you'll get your rewards.
---
So let me get this straight. You just roll for drops?
---
its loot council but our guild leader has been off studying for a couple weeks so they just have us roll on everything lately
---
Same feeling as main mage. Worst decision I made in Classic, didn't think it would be that difficult to get any loot in MC/Ony. I'm leveling up a shaman and a druid to main one of them from BWL onwards. I'm tired of investing hours for no loot, when I can use those hours to study for my public examinations.
---
+1 my guild rolled on Faerlina for the sole reason that it was a sure bet to remain highly populated/active and somewhat competitive
---
He's playing a different game?
---
Early levels you grab whatever has the most damage - even 2h. Surviving is less of a problem early than having threat
---
So why isn't av like that anymore?  Whenever I do av in retail it's like 30-40 minutes or so. A far cry from 8 hours but not 8 minute zergs. Just because the rep doesn't matter now?
---
Blizzard, just make this an option instead of selecting a bg number.  
---
Local queue (cohesive, but longer queue) or CR queue (disparate, but shorter queue).
---
You may want to suggest a different loot system, if it's been straight /roll there's probably others in your same shoes with RNG
---
If that gets shot down then yeah consider a DKP / Loot Council guild since you'll have a better shot instead of just RNG
---
Problem is the queue for horde. U dont want to sit longer in queue then the actual av itself lol.
---
Ignoring the fact that “worst case scenario” is most certainly NOT the worst case scenario most of the comments are noting that majority of the rep-giving resources for horde in this scenario stop giving rep at Revered, which leaves 21k rep to be farmed. 
---
There is an argument to be made in this post but it’s flimsy at best. 
---
There is a reason horde have changed their tactics and are now stopping the alliance strat - because losing a game in 10 minutes isn’t as efficient for honor/rep as winning the game. Plus you get the satisfaction of winning.
---
as predicted everything got a lot better but i still get ganked by honor farmers every now and then.
---
&gt;If they wanted AV to be a contest then they shouldn't have put in the massively nerfed 1.12 version.
---
bullshit copout. Illum planet in SWTOR called and laughed in your face.
---
Blaming player behavior on the developer is so 2019.
---
yeah i'm not sure if it's an anomaly but with our dkp system i've been here at each raid and i'm basically drowning in epic. For me it worked quite nicely. I know even with dkp other classes have rougher time tho so idk.
---
Took me 28 runs. It took my guild 135 runs to get his. I got super lucky with my drop.
---
This has to be a troll account
---
You could sell them 
---
If you run out of budget your plan was flawed from the start
---
Did he deliver though?
---
Spriest/paladin or warrior. Shadow form plus tank spec is alot of damage reduced. Warrior/paladin for unkillable. Hunter/lock for 2 pets and meme.
---
Yikes... not at all.
---
Real Vanilla AV was an all day grind fest. Losing that to the current cross realm BG rush meta is tragic. Cross realm BGs have replaced the vanilla flavor with retail meh flavor.
---
Hilarious and intelligent. Nice move!
---
No good mage charge people in their dungeon group. I don't sell water but usually people whisper me what they want and say they are willing to tip. I don't share in av raids unless I have tons of premade water in bags.
---
Low effort meme
---
Not a BoE, but get the pants from the gnomer quest asap since they'll carry you forever
---
Not if you want to grind serious honor. No one will take breaks on alliance because you will fall behind. On Horde you are "forced" to make a 10min break between every av.
---
I remember vanilla being like this .. we literally would see the same drops every week. Would try different raid leaders, group composition, different tanks/attacks. 
---
Someone in my guild started pugging MC cause our drops have been mostly the same and he hasn't seen what he's looking for yet.
---
oMg sO 2o19
---
exactly
---
So done with this meme format and I hate disney
---
How to check before you enter?
---
Stealth is actually a toggle, so if you use it while already being in stealth it turns it off.
---
Exactly what I think. Min-maxing is so unimportant in vanilla. Maybe aq40 or naxxramas. Not before.
---
Herb, far sight in Azshera to check if you can fish essence of water and kill saytrs. (These die in like 2 LB's and 1 shock. Less if you get crits.)
---
Work on SP gear to replace healing gear while farming. Can also toss a 2h wep on and rockbiter. You'll still hit hard and will save some mana. No real need to respec.
---
Fish winter squid or, if you are able, nightfin. Think blackmouth goes for a nice price still. 
---
Depending on prof you might be able to buy stuff on AH for cheaper than the crated item vendors for to make AFK/waiting around gold. 
---
Just a couple ideas from some of the things I do. I'll note I am an ele sham.
---
I would say if your class officer isn't listening, take it to the next level. If everyone is blowing you off, talk to the guild master. Express that you are considering leaving the guild and the game due to unfairness.
---
This is the thing that's the most strange about it all. The anti min/max crowd don't seem to be able to understand that for a lot of people it is fun to strive for the highest performance possible for your character. 
---
I used to do it in the past but it has lost it's appeal for me, plus I learnt a long time ago that none of it necessarily matters when the other people in your raid group keep costing you kills due to their incompetence.
---
I've been in a lot of guilds with min/max players over the years and not once have I seen them try and force this on other players. I am starting to suspect a lot of people concoct stories about things they don't like on here to support their case.
---
The only times I have ever seen someone blocked from going for loot for not being best in slot is when it IS best in slot for other players.
---
Perfect, as always.
---
Punishment for rolling on the overpopulated faction.
---
&gt;I would put the last boss be at heroic difficulty, not brutally easy.
---
That is brutally easy, my retail guild clears heroic in the first raid week as do many others. We'd literally have effectively nothing to do for 6+ months with a single difficulty.
---
&gt;Besides, Classic has hardcore raiders, yet MC is easy. The hardcore seem to have no issue finding ways to challenge themselves.
---
Not the same. There doesn't exist a hardcore progress scene in Classic. To me roflstomping through the raid and then farming it for months to get gear to kill people in world pvp is not hardcore raiding.
---
Druids have the best meme names, so it is not surprising.
---
Defending Blizzard after they've shown time and time again that they do not care in the slightest about creating a fun gameplay experience and instead just want to leech money and time out of their players is bootlicking beyond bootlicking.
---
What’s measured is managed. This is primarily Blizzards fault.
---
Yeah I concede that sounds like a special form of hell. I love the concept of the class but hate how it plays in Classic.
---
Most caster weps post BWL are one-hand for some reason
---
Change who the read lead is and enters the instance first.
---
Usually not a fan of non-RP names, but Shatnerfais is the one that made me laugh the hardest.
---
My guild uses this addon but I can't figure out how to get the view that you have.  Is that an officer only view?   I have the addon installed.   How could I see loot like this?
---
Oops I was more asleep than I thought last night. 
---
In any case I agree.
---
Yeah I made that mistake in actual vanilla. If I roll a warlock it'll be Orc or Undead, never Alliance again.
---
There's warriors who wait for healers to regain mana instead of chain pulling the Marshals then whining in chat about how no ones healing them?
---
Literally just happened to me. Rage quit my house and went to get coffee haha
---
We've actually done that a couple times, and that's where some of the real good stuff dropped weirdly enough
---
If it is meant to be fair and people are meant to not roll when they win items, the case should be investigated further by the class officer and the guild master should press on the class officer to investigate it further.
---
haha yeah that what i thought too, before AV i only got like 5k honor a day
---
This is how I felt about my Skullflame Shield - I'd bring it to raids and everyone wanted me to put the Draconian on but god damn it look awful..
---
yes but more than enough to kill a boss.
---
min maxing IS WRONG REEEEEE
---
I got like 240k as Alliance till exalted.
---
But I also played most of my games before the Horde decided that they want to zerg.
---
We usually kill Galvangar far before Horde kills Balinda. And still kill Drek'thar. Also we wreck most of Horde lieutenants/commanders unless they are too out of the way.
---
So I think his maths are wrong.   
---
Plus  Alliance got istant queues so I'd take whatever I can get and out in 8mins
---
You strike me the type to complain about everything.. what should I complain about? 
---
You clearly are biased towards one faction. I love both factions. This is what I've noticed while playing both factions. No need to get your panties in a bunch. And it's not even really a complaint.. its observation,  and it's quite clear
---
There are a max number of pools that can be up at one time
---
Couple hours is my best guess. Most resources, even old ones, don’t really have an exact time. I usually make a lap around all the spawns, then just log out for a while and check again later. No real consistent way to get them, that I know of.
---
This is your best bet. It’s a great resource.
---
ATM machine
---
About 2 hours, but the spawns are random and only a certain number will be up at any given time until the new spawns are fished out.
---
We kinda do, but we also kill Galvangar (most of the time before they can kill Balinda)
---
The people who spammed this sub whining and crying about wPvP on a PvP server don't deserve any pats on the back. This thread is a huge L. I wish Blizz opened one-way PvP -&gt; PvE transfers during phase 2 so that you people would be flushed out but alas.
---
Do you share your internet conection? Maybe during the day someone else is using all the bandwith, and you get a lot of lag while playing.
---
5-12 minutes at peak times on EU
---
This is the kind of bullshit that turned me against guilds.
---
Killing Galv + Lieutenants =/= rush Drek. It results in almost 3k honor and consistent 8-10 min wins.
---
Cenarion is all we get.
---
Hold up! I just ran the numbers... this adds up, absolutly no way its a coincidence.
---
Galvangar dies too
---
Reckoning isn't a Ret talent...
---
Can't do any of that if your warrior rushes the full team Anand your other is yoloing the EFC lol.
---
I just end up going defense the last couple of bgs, partner up with a priest and bottle neck attackers while the priest throws down dps.  Rogue too is a nice combo.  Took on 4-5 targets with these partner combos which makes for some effective "at bats".
---
Agree, this is some of the dumbest shit I've read on this subreddit.
---
Loot in retail is basically would you like to spend 3 months gearing up or outgear all that work in 2 weeks due to catch up mechanics?
---
The neck and weapon level system before it was barely better for this.
---
Not very motivating to be aware that you can achieve more in considerably less time if you just wait...
---
Then on top of this is all the shitty forging rolls. If loot from easier raids is better I would rather it is due to itemisation choices rather than sheer luck.
---
Faces have to be melted..
---
Okay, your a filthy casual, what’s your point?
---
The real alliance rankers are doing 20k+ honor an hour putting in half the effort of wsg rankers
---
Every time I've gone to that spot, its overcamped.  Actually I had it for about 20 minutes to myself once before 2 other players showed up... but 9/10 times everything is dead and there are 3 players camping.
---
If this tells you anything, the top honor brackets for hardcore servers that have agreed upon caps will probably be around 1.5 million honor. You can do the math based on your rank and how tryhard of a server you are on to try to predict a bit what you will get.
---
As a horde player the "some honor" part is wrong. We tend to get way more honor. (Like 2-4x depending on the match) A losing match is still some 2k-2.5k honor if you are killing the lieutenants. Jumps to around ~4k of you win. 
---
I know horde only plays vs horde in the honor gains for PvP rank but if you aren't killing the lieutenants for the bonus you are falling way behind those who are. 
---
Ally skip this step because they have the advantage in the zerg strat but they are competing with others who generally get the same 700-1000 honor for using the zerg so it doesn't matter for them as much. Though if they had a group of 5 people hunt those while they push on drek they could increase their match honor gains.
---
So buy some...
---
ssshhh just let him keep rushing :)
---
Well I think you look ravishing!
---
nice screenshot, buddy
---
Lol, yeah I play wow for the PVE content. Given that I have more than 9 brain cells I’m not easily entertained by “me zug zug oof smash” like you PvP smooth brains are.
---
I just corpse camp them until it's zero honor then i right click report and run off.
---
Most rational comment on here.
---
Iron on my server goes on AH for almost as much as thorium (thorium is admittedly depressed because of DME jump runs).
---
Best is when you have that one guy from feirlina yelling that everyone is useless, yelling "EFC" as the only directive, is 15 deaths 1kb on score with no objectives, and shuts up when we win in the second half lol.
---
If you are constantly getting passed over when it comes to loot then it means they don't value you as a player. If they don't value you as a player, then there is no reason for you to be in their guild.
---
who wanna spend five minutes healing a guys for one kill when you can melt 5 faces in the same time.
---
I've seen a pure rush Drek only once this week. Maybe is just how we do things in EU
---
Burden of proof is on the claimant, for the record.

enjoy waiting an hour for a queue pop to fight the same people over and over again
---
I've been in more bgs with paladins than I've seen in open world.  It's beautiful.
---
To be precise. It didnt work like in Blizzard's 1.12 reference client. 
---
If it was bugged( or to be precise, if it scaled with +hp in their reference client) it **would not be fixed**.
---
Not only that... but dropping shadowform to be confronted by the fashion disaster that is sp gear... no tnx way to confronting
---
sulfuras is very close to 50/50
---
Too bad there's not a single meat vendor in the city. Only reason UC isn't my hearth
---
There was a rogue in the CDL that had it and he did well.
---
If someone could amend the title, that would be great, my phone autocorrected BGs 🤣
---
We did this a few weeks ago and on the opening trash got double epics!
---
Faster game times with a more controllable output for a premade group. 
---
Running AV you can get caught in slogs of killing the same people at a bottleneck for *hours*. AB has a guaranteed time limit. AV you're almost guaranteed to get some people not pulling their weight with the huge numbers, AB is a tight, controlled group. 
---
I'm not sure how the honour is dolled out exactly, I just know every GM grinding group ran AB almost exclusively.
---
Alliance... Hihihihih you're so funny. This is why we make fun of you as horde players.
---
You and are are the same person it looks like. I made the exact same choices. I am however doing a disgusting about of marudon farming and plan on buying all the mats for true faith, hide of the wild and I’m gonna buy that shit ass trinket because I absolutely cannot lose another roll for it. It’s not worth the heartache of doing another failed Jed run (only to spend the next half an hour doing the worst part of UBRS) to replace second wind with the reed when second wind is on CD. Literally every other piece of gear I have other than those mentioned is as good as I can possibly get. everyone can chill about reed. I more want it now  for my shadow set, to replace with wind on CD and more efficient Mara farming.
---
I enjoy the long games.  It gives you a chance to actually play strategically.  I don't mind the fast win/losses either.  I've seen lots of complaining about how AV is boring, but man I love that place.   It's always changing too, now that the hard chargers are exalted and have their rewards, the games have been more like they were in TBC.
---
cool a few internet points! Upvote!
---
1800dmg gratz you barley broke my pw: shield. Now you still have 4.9k hp to remove... why you running? Wernt we having fun? You started come back and finish it
---
You are the prime example of why DKP is a thing.  Loot council is greedy corrupt few getting all their BiS items first... And RNG can lead to just pure bad luck.  But with that said, DKP starts to be bad when people accumulate a lot of points and don't spend them.  They can always win items over people who don't raid as much or join the guild dkp system late.  So you are at a disadvantage switching to a dkp guild now.
---
I'd just quit in your situation, I think because you are new... you failed to see how harsh the loot was going to be and it's also possible people in the loot council specifically targeted people like you as regular members...
---
Thanks I’ll upvote you too :)
---
I mean yeah... it’s a battleground it’s a team based game mode. Why should a solo player be able to obtain the same rewards as a group of 10 coordinated players?
---
Horde Mankrik have never had more than a 10 minute queue.  Most of the time its between 1 and 5 minutes.
---
There's nothing wrong with doing these things, but to get the rewards of the battleground you DO NOT have to do these things. Which is why people don't do them, they just want the rewards. Going by that logic you could ask your self "Isn't the point of an RPG to actually RP? Why do people not role play?"
---
OP sounds like the person who's delusional enough to justify camping flight point and IF and actual griefing and even manage to play the  victim of the system that *forces* him to do such things.
---
&gt; you can easily hit a 400+ damage non crit arcane shot, which is also instant, 41 range, and goes through armour.
---
Once every 5 seconds with the talent. Which means it's dogshit. 80 dps at 0% crit, around 100 dps with the crit multi talent at 20% crit chance (which you won't have due to spell power gear).
---
It's not good, even against low geared targets. Best use case is against a beefy bear druid. Even then they can pop out of form and rejuv to almost outheal your impact with the spell.
---
Yep, got stuck on a loading screen and after restarting the client can't reconnect.
---
Use Healbot or mouseover macros with raid frames.
---
Hmm,  I was told WSG is better honor but I haven't checked it myself, has the one who told me this been clueless?
---
Ouch and its only going to get worse for Horde as I am on a PvE server most of the people in my guild want to get exalted for the rewards and then they will play AV rarely ever after.
---
I have a lot of pvp fights in av ... roaming around defending towers etc. most games last 15-20min and it’s fun.  Edit: the amount of honor you gain is irrelevant its about the time investment.
---
Same here, EU.
---
Actually going back and forth from AH-mail-anvil is pretty annoying. Nowhere close to TB closeness
---
Same here. "You have been disconnected. (BLZ51901016)" immediately after entering my password.
---
EDIT: EU
---
Queue Boromir meme, one does not simply start a UBRS Rend run without checking for Jed ID first
---
Ouch and its only going to get worse for Horde as I am on a PvE server most of the people in my guild want to get exalted for the rewards and then they will play AV rarely ever after. I am playing on Pagle which is a East Coast PvE server.
---
I’ve personally seen thunderfury drop twice and I was master looter both times so I ninja looted then both to myself not realizing warlocks cant put them on
---
Nah man, nobody is ACTUALLY in the battleground to do battle against the other faction for FUN.  Absolutely everyone that queues for AV is interested in as much quick rep or honor as possible, never both just one or the other.
---
Yep, same here. Error code BLZ51901016
---
classic pvp was never really about skill. it always was a massive grind.
---
Dude if you’re a healer you have a say in what the group does.
---
same -- eu
---
Very cool thanks for the heads up.
---
You’re*
---
It's still hunter loot, you just can't equip it.
---
Pretty sure this happens with my mouseovers too.
---
I'm pretty sure my mouseovers don't work when this happens.

"We're currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers, which may result in failed or slow login attempts. #BlizzCS"
---
I dont feel bad for you. Horde made most of pvp servers unplayable so this is just joy to my ears.
---
Tbf its very easy to ban bots when you actually have gms ingame and familiar with the game.
---
Having trouble also it’s quite frustrating.
---
I didn't find this quest line to be nearly as bad as everyone says. Chances are you're already going to be in UBRS a decent amount, and with a mage getting to the dragons isn't a big deal. The whole test of skulls took less than 2 hours, and you can AFK/watch TV through most of the traveling.
---
It's fucking hilarious, the queues are the shortest they've ever been in vanilla and people whine having to wait between 5 and 10 minutes.
---
Oh cool, I just got a regular mount on my *main*.
---
I play AV for rep, honor and fun...
---
Sulfuras is in fact one of the most balanced servers but it’s still 60/40 my dude
---
Tauren druids are the most peaceful horde i have come across most actually help me when I'm questing.
---
Ooooh I didn't know that. Now I know not to port to UC if there's a hunter in my group. Thanks!
---
You aren't wrong... WoW PvP is just a time played grind for item rewards. Never heard it any other way. But I doubt it changes, and from my perspective WoW PvP has always been 2nd rate to many other PvP multiplayer games... Even DAoC an mmo that released in 2002 designed their end game PvP systems far better than WoW ever did in all its expansions.  I think even dark souls had better structure to their PvP game compared with wow, and that's a game all about unfair advatages.
---
You get instant queues how is that fucking you over?
---
I believe its between 1-3 hours which seems to be consistent with my experience of it.
---
The AV everyone actually wants to play.
---
https://youtu.be/RJM1UzDbk5o
---
Short answer . . . yes. If you have gotten zero drops in 8 weeks there is something wrong - unless your loot tables just suck bad for the raid and nothing mage wise really drops. Our first 3 weeks we saw one mage tier drop and the only epics that dropped they could use were Mageblade (hahha only) and staff of dominance. We had salty mages but there was nothing we could do.
---
Same for mine. We had 4 onslaughts, 3 staff of dom drop back to back to back weeks, then 2x mage blades drop back to back and now we haven’t seen either in 5 weeks. Something is definitely up.
---
Yeah, though in terms of WoW character gains, it still works out.
---
Lame.  I feel like that should be available to the whole raid.
---
That's what (s)he said
---
Horde has like no reason at all to do lbrs once you're done warlord's command. So when I levelled to 60 back in the day I got there a couple months after most people, and finding a group for that dungeon on a medium pop realm and lower pop faction was a nightmare. Took me literally weeks to complete the ony attunement.
---
Yes, im having the same problem.
---
I feel like expecting your whole team to lose with you for your own personal honor and rep gains really hurts the experience of playing AV
---
Me too, so if I'm getting any of those, then I'm happy.
---
hmmm, it seems to me you did the same thing a lot of guys do, give up the life that made them happy to be with a woman. women don't seem to realize that they cannot replace that life that made their man who he was when they met him. they wish they could be all a man needs but it's not possible imo. partners/family/friends, etc (ie other people) can be big slices of your life pie but not the whole pie. there's a big slice for you and only you that you gotta protect and take before others eat it! ideally you could continue that ski life (I'm Canadian so i understand)  and still be with her... maybe in a few years you are in a position where you're able to invest in a ski resort, be a manager or something that pays enough for you to keep both your family and your love for ski.  i believe anything is possible if u really put your mind and heart into it. 
---
there's also a saying that goes something like "the more available you are and the more you give yourself for free, the less people will respect you". think of the CEO of a huge company, everyone knows how busy he is and that every minute counts so there's no room for small talk, clowning around or trying to convince him that he should lower his expectations or self worth. be the boss, the ceo of your life. 
---
my point is you gotta be on an epic quest to achieve ultimate happiness or whatever you dream of and your loved ones are your teammates like healers, buffers, dps... lol. real life is a role-playing game! but yeah, sometimes everyone in your team have the same goals but a lot of time we're just helping them reach theirs and that's completely fine. 
---
and yeah, video games are a silly waste of time or even childish for those who are not into them but i believe the reason they exist is to create connections for people to interact together. they are made by real people who also have families and making those games is a real job that pays their bills. my point is that we play them for much deeper reasons than just entertainment, it's still real life experience. 
---
i don't know if i make total sense but basically i think i know how u feel and i hope you will make it all work in a win/win type of way.
---
(ps french is my first language so if sentences are weird that's why hehe)
---
I'm having the same problem
---
i advise everyone NOT to do that because i regret rolling alliance on a pvp server. being camped is not fun. fighting your way to do ANYTHING is not fun. it's improved since battlegrounds but its only going to get worse from here.
---
The bridge is not the only way out of the base, you can just hope down the small ridge to the south. But to get in yes the bridge is a major choke point.
---
There is a small spot to sneak in through the back that most people just dont know about unless someone shows you.
---
Valor looks amazing, super cool set. Well done!
---
As someone who was looking for a way to find turtles specifically, thank you!
---
I love seeing people in MC gear because its so distinct, which will be come even more apparent when other raid tiers come out. Retail has lost this feeling imo.
---
49s is a wonderful bracket to twink in though. Only gear out once rather than the 60 grind each time a new raid comes out. True balance of all specs, no new abilities besides the lost talent points that could be used to improve some abilities, and mounts to balance classes that have speed increases. 
---
If interested in twinking 49 hit up my guild discord for info and guides.
---
https://discord.gg/spyKgcK
---
It's funny to witness the changes in alterac meta literally every day
---
There was, EWT, which is one of the primary classic bots got detected and many were banned. Blizz actually does a very good job of combatting bots, they sue creators so most of the really good ones are gone
---
I love stuff like this. I met someone on my server named deem and I’m deemster and now we have a long standing rivalry and banter whenever we see each other
---
Yeah and then 10 seconds later you would be lower on the table.
---
Same.
---
But what about all those people who said horde and alliance were balanced population wise?
---
"There are just as many horde heavy servers as there are alliance servers!"
---
He’s not in a Loot Council guild, they straight up /roll the items and rely on people having won items “not rolling so others can get some too”. It’s even worse than LC.
---
Bring major mana pots, oil of immolation and GET A DRUID TO GIVE YOU THORNS. Seriously, thorns help sooooooo much on this quest to kill the skeletons hitting you.
---
100% agree with OP.
---
I've never been ganked by a Tauren Rogue...
---
Me too :(
---
How does it work if you encounter another premade?
---
uninstall
---
Yeah I know. I've joined a group and said I'll only come if we do that boss and they've agreed. Just haven't tried really to get the last piece
---
Playing on a RU server here: on the first day we were grouped with european servers, but starting day 2 we only get grouped with other RU servers for some unknown reason. Truly the language barrier must be the only reason to do so, as most russians don't speak English at all, and some even start typing the only words they know in English (curse words) as soon as they see a foreigner :(
---
Just in case: you get R14 will be for those who farm honor 24/7 the most efficient way possible, right? Unfortunately, I mean literal 24/7.
---
My guild had this happen a couple weeks ago, since then we get a TOEP every week. Also we've had an ingot drop every week, 6 mageblades, 6 choker of the firelords, and enough cenarion to 8/8 several druids.
---
If you read his other comment... The guild switched from LC over to RNG.
---
Less turn in quests no shredder. No black lotus or thorium veins. All npcs nerfed. Mines removed. And I'm sure I'm missing a few.
---
Not even close to comparable
---
As a mage items that are general caster are always going to be slow. You will always roll with other mages, warlocks, and the occasional Boomie, ele shaman, and shadow priest. Since many different classes roll against you caster deeps classes will feel this struggle the most. My guild runs 2 resto shamans and both are tiered out because there is only 2, even our bear druid has half a set for healing. My guild doesn't run DKP or what I would call a lot council. We have agreements among classes. I myself play a resto shaman and of us 3 we decided to stage tier by set bonus so wants you have a 3 peice you hold rolls until others have 3, the. To 5 and eventually 8. All non needed items default to our 1 enhance proc shaman. Luckily we have the same 35 raiders every week and 5 that come and go week to week. We also had the same issue for one mage a few guys who won the roll passed the item to him. When I created the guild that was the intention for our community. It was more important to me to have the same group of guys every week as oppose to people getting upset and leaving actually causing further disparity in gear dispersion.
---
There 4 Russian servers, 3pvp, 1 pve
---
Where was that BG bingo, this one of tiles!
---
I type “/emote has reported you for being AFK. Type /afk to remove yourself from being removed from AV in 30 seconds. “
---
Vanish is a CD and not even a targetted ability so of course it can't be deadzoned, his post clearly implied it would get rid of the deadzone all together tho which it doesn't.
---
That’s what claimant means
---
My guild does this, too. Say a Hunter Item drops, all hunters who dont have it may then roll, the highest roll gets it. The guy who wins the item is then excluded from further rolls in the current raid(unless every other got 1 item in the current run, too, then everyone can roll again).  
---
Works quite well yet.
---
You can join our raid. We’ve only had giantstalker and might boes drops (obviously a rare few sprinkled in). Leveling a warrior to get on the action!
---
Ty!
---
2 resto druids* 3 shams, 5 priest
---
I'm jealous :)
---
Congrats, Clap Clap!
---
I guess it's bandage spec healers for your Jed/Rend runs from now on then.
---
Ouch. Got it on first try and was thinking about passing it since I already had a spell crit neck.
---
I’m on Hydraxian Waterlords EU! It’s a PvE RP server. Super nice community.
---
im impressed
---
They don’t exist
---
200 rep? Are you not hitting Belinda? That's 125 right there, other objectives will give you some too
---
i was alone just doing what i can to get more honor, i can see some br14 people who are 100k over me that they are maxing out honor every game and alone cand do shit
---
Is the weapon that good for hunter?
---
That's hilarious and I love it.
---
At least you aren't camped at every fp and zone, feel free to go to your 5 mans.
---
Or have fun at BGs: playing casually means you shouldn't expect to win and shouldn't care about winning.
---
Bye
---
It is not directly horde overpopulation. Rather it is Alliance having gained rep 3 times as fast in the begining due to constant wins. Because of that, alliance was done rep grinding a lot faster. Resulting in fewer alliance queing and thus too many horde. Because of that Horde waiting times went from like 1-3 mimutes to 10 minutes.
---
It’s going to be. When I did it in TBC it was almost always spawned when I checked.
---
I swear on big wins give more than 1k rep. I played a 1 hour game and got at least 2k
---
Are these bots programmed with predefined actions or are they using those fancy A.I. stuff like deep learning? Cause just imagine this sucker improving itself with every failure until this kind of lure won't work out anymore.
---
Cute!
---
Same...
---
My favorite druid name I've ever seen was KittyPurry.
---
Best overall name was a male tauren: Thatsnotmilk
---
Its still random tho so he probably got unlucky. Ive only done 1 WSG so far and had a nice short match vs APES premade. Got slapped so hard i went back to mindlessly farming honor in AV.
---
He's making the germans proud
---
Probably because they build DAoC to be that. WoW was built from the ground up as a PVE game. PVP was implemented after the fact to appease the playerbase. That's why.
---
I'm sure they will release weekend specific  bgs
---
I wouldn't go on a PvP server but I heard a Russian PVP server has like 80+% Alliance ... that's balance to me :)
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
lmao in literally every AV match I've played, horde ends the match with 3x as much honor.
---
Is twinking related to James Charles?
---
this might not auto buy but it seems very similar: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/buyemall-classic
---
I can't imagine wanting the rep rewards and having to wait up to 12 minutes to get in and then immediately losing in 8 minutes 90% of the time
---
Then Healbot all the way!
---
Absolutely disgusting
---
its not half bad considering I needed to do the rep grind anyways
---
i insta /afk if game gets to 15m mark and we no where near south
---
AV now takes way longer to be played.
---
My understanding is you should not use rank 3. Yes it has a faster cast time, but it is very inefficient. You might as well look at regrowth instead.
---
Spells learnt below level 20 get less benefit from +healing and rank 3 is learnt at level 14. You should use rank 4 for your cheap heal.
---
I'm far from the world's best healer though so I would love feedback.
---
ITT a bunch of alliance that are basically asking horde to start camping their flight paths again
---
I Iove how Alliance will blame the turtle on literally anything but what caused it: horde capping stonehearth early.
---
+ epic dagger and BIS ring? yeah it's worth it
---
Human warrior, I use it every time I see or hear a stealth class enter stealth. It’s not like a use on CD ability, but it’s pretty good for exploding a stealthy every once in a while. Given that I’m Arms spec... I enjoy seeing rogues.
---
Yeah, once I gent don Julio's im out of AV and I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way on the alliance side.
---
Well guys i'm not having fun in Classic but if i play retail or another game my viewer count goes down, And im all about the viewer count.
---
&gt;  I don't know what the queues would be like for a horde premade, but I'm guessing they'd be long and definitely not worthwhile if all you want is honor. 
---
correct
---
Obviously. But then that's why you're doing it. Not the mount
---
IVUS DER WALDFÜRST
---
If all the Alliance adopt his idea then horde just use their half of the raid with epic mounts to rush Vann and you get to watch the meta evolve yet again.
---
I mean if you're playing on EU, probably accurate...
---
That's how it was in vanilla.
---
&gt;I've watched certain members be handed multiple pieces
---
Also from OPs reply to another comment:
---
&gt;its loot council but our guild leader has been off studying for a couple weeks so they just have us roll on everything lately
---
This honestly makes me so happy.
---
A lot of people want PvP ranks, so it's going to be extremely competitive, and that means spending a lot of time doing whatever nets you most honor. If you don't want to do that, well, don't.
---
What did you expect?
---
This is one of best things about WoW, there is no right way to play it. sure there is optimal, but thats not for all. there are people who 
---
min/max
---
plays casually
---
Only like leveling/questing
---
Only like pve
---
only like pvp
---
only fish
---
play to roleplay
---
play "sub optimal " specs or build
---
who dont care about builds
---
and many many more
---
You play the way to make it fun for you, and its downright stupid to attack anyone for they playstyle.
---
Yeah, doubles your damage, increases speed a bit, and then eventually does aoe damage
---
Yup.
---
My guild does this too but has given the classes a certain amount of autonomy with their own loot council. All of our members of the same class discuss with each other what loot they really want and what they are going to roll on. When some fall behind on loot the people ahead pass to let them get loot. Of course, everyone is super chill and it takes the right group of people to make this work.
---
For most guilds, heroic difficulty isn't brutally easy. Frankly, I am far more concerned about the experience of 99% of raiding guilds over the top 1%.
---
I think raiding caters far too much to that demographic.
---
Because small brain
---
Classic PvP was still about PvP though, this is not.
---
Well that’s what happens, premades will just dodge other premades. It’s the most efficient way to farm honor. Why waste time fighting a hard fought battle when you can steam roll.
---
We did it in classic for any premades for a rank 13. You would have one person join the BG, everyone would drop Q if it’s a premade. Benefits of playing alliance.
---
More like, horde started breaking the gentleman's agreement and now we have to resort to less efficient but more reliable tactics.
---
Banning a user for abusing the broken game mechanic.  Sounds like you don’t want anyone who overly reported AFKs to get caught, are you one of those assholes?
---
Ah that song from Stronghold was such a good choice. Thank you!
---
What do you mean supposed? Sure, that's how Blizzard intended it to be 15 years ago, but it didn't work and they consequently changed it to work better. We got the shitty unfixed version so their original intentions are completely irrelevant.
---
Don’t try to reason with these people. They’re empowered by g o T o rEtAaiL and a hatred for people who play the game differently. 
---
Ill take my downvotes with pride. Gen 1 bracket 1 solo players...yikes
---
WOOD NEEDED
---
**MORE WOOD IS NEEDED**
---
how much rep tho?
---
7 Brutality blades in 11 weeks. 0 OEB, 0 BRE, 1 Spinal Reaper. Would be crazy if we were alliance, but now all we have is a bunch of pissed off orc-furys.
---
Not OP but I just started grinding yesterday, Horde side - played a total of 11 games, we won 6 of them and lost 5. I went from Neutral to Honored and I was pretty casual about it. 
---
Will try to hit exalted by the end of the week but I'm sure i'll get there before then.
---
A few of my guildies jumped early and hit exalted in about 2 days.
---
why is noone doing it ?
---
EDIt: feels silly to "win" with 800 honor vs enemy 2.5k
---
But I get 0 orbs 50% of the time, so 1 orb res is usually 12.5g on my server, since that means I get .5 orbs on average. That is awful gold/hour, not worth doing.
---
On the flipside, it's actually quite useful at level until you have access to other, better rings. I wouldn't be 200g for one, that's for sure.
---
Quit the game and go back to BFA.
---
I’d like to throw my Tauren Druid’s name into consideration: Milkjagger
---
Have you joined the AV discord? It makes it quite fun. Instead of pugging and doing it solo, the premades on disc are usually a win, plus you have actual people in your raid group with voice, its just a cool involving experience I think that wont last for long and we'll look back at.  
---
EDIT: if you're alliance that is, or else forget it.
---
This, free roll is for pugs, if ur just frerolling within ur guild on all pieces ur likely to have ur best players undergeared and ur worst players getting the strongest pieces. We do a loot council where we prioritize items for certain classes and each class decides how they do their loot (some classes choose to just roll between themselves which is fine) but for important pieces we know who is carrying and they get the items first
---
Unless u really like the guys u play with id join another guild with a better loot system. (Rng is also a factor im our warrior class lead so i get the first warr wpn but its been 10 weeks with 0 drops)
---
I got told that minmaxing in mc was overkill for asking a mage to come with 5/5 improved frost bolt... such a small ask
---
Let’s open world duel bro. Renegayde- horde blaumeax fury warrior
---
Cool story
---
Horde queues will probably double from here, around 15-30min as alliance pve players drop out of the queue. I'm really hoping that at some point WSG becomes the better way to farm honor.
---
Do you use discord, talking instead of typing has a way of making people open up and discuss things.
---
This is my biggest complaint, I love getting a price of gear that has a weird effect or just looks silly when you wear it. In classic I can name dozens of items I’m excited to get. I can’t name a single item any of my retail characters have on.
---
Lol my thoughts exactly.  I clicked on this post for information on how I could intentionally queue into a turtle.
---
Ghostcrawler
---
So if the MMO becomes whatever we make it, then how can it be Blizzard's fault whenever we don't like it? 
---
I agree with the spirit of your idea that we can have fun even with the lesser of the AV designs available. I agree that the mmo experience is in large part created by tree mmo community. AV is designed to be a war simulation, and it can be that, if the players use it for that instead of a simple rep grind. 
---
I'm almost revered on horde AV and here's how my games have gone so far.
---
1) alliance wins because horde tries to out race them to the end boss, which as we all know is a losing strategy because of unbalanced terrain mechanics, and we get like 200 rep and around 2500 bonus honor.
---
2) horde wins because horde spends literally minimal effort (like 6 to 10 people) defending drek and delaying the alliance zerg. People are able to complete quests, our team has time to cap bunkers and lieutenants and win. The game usually takes about 25 minutes and we leave with 1200 rep and like 3500 bonus honor.
---
I've had one game go more than 25 minutes because our offensive team capped stonehearth graveyards and our defensive team recapped the southern graveyards. That game ended after 45 minutes and I left with 1800 rep and 5k bonus honor.
---
The rake has the same attack modifier, purely up to you.
---
race specific mounts,  less race/class combos that should of never became a thing, the OG mounts ONLY
---
If you spam the macro and reckoning procs, you get nothing, you loose, good day sir. 
---
According to some other paladins rekbombs, so storing reckoning, still works. That part hasn't changed, but the macro thing is gone. So you don't get an extra attack anymore it just resets swing timer like the trash tier talent it is..
---
You must be on a bad battlegroup then, have 60:40 winrate as horde and we almost always Get more honor :))))
---
Just like everyone playing private predicted. 
---
More news at 9.

---
Laughed a little too hard at this as just yesterday someone said "just defend the zerg and alliance will not know what to do". Went from losing 9/10 games to winning more than losing doing this. Also more rep this way! (horde que is dumb)
---
If only blizzard had the courage needed to not connect PvP and PvE realms so that us PvE horde would not have to wait long also PvP alliance would get to always enjoy instant ques
---
It verys a lot in raid (200-300) in dungeons fights are short so it tends to be higher
---
Bags have been out for a while. I'm tailor, can confirm.
---
As an interesting counter point to this purely anecdotal evidence, my experience the exact opposite. Questing was hard but nothing like what you described. And BGs dont have many premade. I win 90% of WSG as a solo player. I can count the number I lost on 1 hand. Not really the point because BG being released makes questing easier which is what you can fix. I think there is an off chance you just aren't good at the game and its affecting your perspective (which is fine the game takes all types, sheep and wolves). Baaaaaaaaaaa
---
Nah 3 things only should matter, attendance, effort and where is the next upgrade. That lc is stupid if they think that mages dps in mc makes a difference compared to a locks. Locks own mages so long they dont eat a train of resists cuz of their lack of hit talents.
---
For example we give talisman trinket to locks before mages cuz mages replaces it with mind quickening gem in bwl while locks keep it.
---
Is there a way for a druid to remove fear? It seems that no matter how I play, I lose to warlocks 100% of the time, even if they're 5-6 levels lower than me.
---
All I know is day 1 everyone zerg rushed and I got to 3000/21000 revered in one play session. Day 2 everyone argued about galv and horde turtled a lot more and I only got to 9000/21000 in a play session of the same length.
---
Your guild sounds amazing lmao
---
You only get that honor if you were in the game when the lieutenants were killed.  So a person just joining wouldn't benefit from the stuff killed earlier in the game.  Look at the score screen it says bonus honor on the right.  If you just join it will say 0 even if the rest of your team has thousands of bonus honor available.
---
The post is from someone who joined after all the bonus honor objectives were already killed.
---
Sounds like very min max attitude only the few guilds trying to speedrunning should bother with.
---
Start your own group.
---
You don’t need to disable any UI pieces. 
---
If it’s a utility that puts a little badge on the edge of the minimap, you can drag those badges to any position around the edge you want. Most seem to default to right where the PvP BG queue eyeball shows up, but I drag mine around the right side to the screen edge. Just don’t cover the mailbox icon lol.
---
This may solve your problem if you were unaware you could do this.
---
&gt; whoever claim something.
---
So, the claimant?
---
This is the reason it's so fucking annoying having players dismiss strategy before the gates open because "we're here for honor, fast loss please." I didn't just wait 10 minutes to have some rogue squad of players refuse to try to win just so they can min/max honor. What people don't seem to get is that people playing to win literally have no control over the game's outcome when there is a group with that mentality, yet that same group can control if the game ends in a win or loss.
---
yeah not at all the same stop this argument you just look like an idiot
---
Honor means nothing when comparing horde &amp; alliance. They have 2 different pools.
---
You're competing against other horde when it comes to honor grinding.
---
They never actually intended on releasing BG's at the same time as BWL. They have staggered everything and will continue to stagger everything as Classic plays out.
---
No helmet though. Liar.
---
They just weren't fleshed out very well really.  I think there were good ones in TBC, but I dont remember for sure.
---
If you think Mythic raiding guilds are 1% of the raiding audience you're kidding yourself. Since pugging heroic and normal through cross realm group finder has become so easy there aren't nearly as many heroic only guilds anymore.
---
what kind of garbage premades are on your server/faction
---
Oh noooo, it’s so ugly! 😂
---
Yes, that ONE person is single handedly causing losses in his 40 man AV groups... /s
---
Wow, I just go my first set of all greys can't wait to start collecting greens!
---
They are!
---
Incorrect I have been in premade AV's that outtake horde honor every time and wins.
---
Inspect me :) Hydraxian Waterlords EU -&gt; Disa
---
I have a 60 char and this game as every bit as fun as I remember it. Just gotta enjoy what you're doing and do what you enjoy. I'm having a blast and hope you do too.
---
yea, make an alt on a server of your choice.. human or orc and go to the major city. ask ppl how the server is. Benediction seems to have good balance imo
---
Took me over 50 runs. I lost it around 17 times in a roll. I'm scarred. And every time nobody needed it, it didn't drop. 
---
I'm missing HoJ on my warri alt. I have flashbacks.
---
It was, but not at launch. he died 2005, so it was added later, but before BC.
---
You can easily get a couple hundred extra rep per game (if it's not a 5 minute zerg) by looting the corpses of fallen players, then use your frostwolf insignia to recall back to base and turn in what you looted.  All of those quests are repeatable, and give 10 rep per turn in.  It doesn't sound like a lot, but it's pretty easy to get hundreds of armor scraps.
---
Yeah that happened to my guild months ago. MT got Garr binding like our 2nd week, and then the week after that I got a Garr binding and he got his Baron binding. 3 bindings 2 weeks, haven't seen one since.
---
Outliers happen when there's small sample sizes.
---
I heard the 19th. Stock up on small eggs!
---
Huehuehue, exactly
---
I need a rule 7 enforced here pls
---
The rank 3 pvp trinket breaks fear for druids
---
I remember our high warlord and GM on my server lived in AV. Of every classic experience we've had so far, this is the most accurate.
---
Most frustrating thing is how dense the lower brackets are now. It may thin out once people hit exalted, or they might decide "hey this is easy honor, I'm going to rank." B6 is 150k honor, I wonder what it'll update to today. Top Honor this week will probably be 1.2M
---
so roughly 1/4 to exalted
---
Aka rank 3
---
Any idea where a Earth Elemental Invasion is?
---
I've played both factions at 60 and would have to disagree.
---
Ashbringer
---
Can you pull more than one mob as a warrior leveling in retail?
---
It's not part of the meta yet.
---
Balinda is part of the horde meta because the alliance can rush Drek faster than horde can rush Vann. So we kill it (plus commanders) to guarantee a lot of honor/rep on a loss.
---
Alliance are used to winning in 6-7 minutes, and therefore skip anything that slows them down.
---
This will change over time, but the meta shifts very slowly in AV.
---
So much fucking Cenarion. Then one of our geared to the teeth druids tried to complain about gear the other day, i had to shut it down. We have stored every piece of cenarion for a few weeks now to DE. They are so geared.
---
Well, most people dont buy one bar at a time. But to each their own i guess.
---
Camp tower point free hks
---
I barely played during tbc, what was the difference?
---
What are they defending against? Everyone is in AV.
---
Just did a /who Ironforge and it says 0.
---
I did 90k honor first day, 70k second day and 50k third day, almost excalted.
---
It aint that simpele anymore to grind that much honor fast in AV as the first days.
---
Im alliance and we won almost every single match the first 2 days, fast sweet honor/rep. 
---
Now the horde try to slow us midfield, people start dying while mounted, few horde going in down South and everyone panics, lost.
---
The honor is terrible compared to the first days so i think it will level out a bit over the weeks, 100k a day will be harder and harder as the good zerg players are excalted already.
---
Good thing bg's are cross realm
---
It is pretty funny watching the Drek alliance panic when Horde actually defend.
---
We had that 2 weeks ago.
---
I always wondered what one of these low IQ small brain tryhards actually thought when they try to wipe the raid and turn AV into a 40 minute turtle. Now I know.
---
Then you probably got the chat addon prat which interferes, you either remove it or join the battle through the button on ur minimap
---
A properly designed game will take into account player behavior. This is why nost was so great they made custom changes to accommodate massive population and faction balance unlike blizz who just ship 1.12.
---
Sorry you don't like facts. Alliance is overpowered.
---
Druid code :D
---
neat
---
why do you look like a panda
---
It's people like you that ruined the new Modern Warfare. Matchmaking sucks ass.
---
&gt; You cant go somewhere else do some gold making and stuff.. 
---
You don't have to wait near the warmaster.  If you've got queues of more than 5 minutes, you can queue from a warmaster SOMEWHERE and fly/run to a spot where you can farm something.  I don't want to give away my secret, but I can queue in Orgrimmar and fly to a mining/grinding spot before the queue pops.  I can queue from Arathi and there are resources to gather in the area that sell for more than nothing - which is better than standing around in your capital city holding your ....sword.   If you've got herbing, there's a spot I'd check every damn time between queues for Grommsblood that is close to a capital city, you've just got to be industrious.
---
Done the prequest several times on both factions and i'd rather do it twice as horde than once as alliance.
---
Technically if all of horde coordinated and did the backdoor strat it would be faster than the alliance zerg, but that would require horde to be coordinated
---
Perhaps you've chosen the wrong game. I enjoy playing it, but warcraft classic is kinda a shit game. It caters to the no life crowd, it is the arena of who can neglect real life more. That is unless you don't worry about rank or loots and try to find other ways to  have fun.
---
You are the kind of person who is needlessly unhelpful. And probably bitches incessantly when people around them simply need help with small matters.
---
Whoa wait where tf can I get in a 3 min WSG?
---
Everyone gets the armor scraps, etc. turn in rep?
---
I think this should happen. I have 12 MC clears with pretty much the same people. We have seen zero TOEP, zero rings of spell power, zero bands of accuria, and only 2 mageblades. We had freaking 3 OEBs drop last week, including the one with low ass drop rate from Golemagg... and this week? Another OEB off golemag... the casters are on the verge of death.
---
I find this shit funny how people just hated wpvp and now bgs are out and some how yall are still more angry/bored.
---
So...pretty much every game nowadays?
---
Can you make a shortcut with the old name?
---
DO NOT HELP HER. 
---
Advice is cool - but if you heal a villager for her, or buff her or anything - it auto fails and she has to wait (i think) 15 mins to try again.
---
What's that? You lost your pinky finger? Welp, better cut off the whole arm.
---
I mean, the arm is already compromised after all so there's zero sense in trying to preserve what's still there.
---
and then you get banned because you botted your way to 60, still a waste.
---
&gt;I mean you cant do anything if you want to rank up in pvp  
---
Pretty much, any moment you are not gaining honor I can guarantee somebody else out there is. All day, everyday. What's worse is that it the grind is 100x more brutal than it every was in vanilla because of all the try hard meth addicts that stay up all night and day grinding their teeth and grinding AV.
---
Some of us don’t have the Sword of 1000 Truths okay!!
---
Living the meme.
---
Yeah everyone is out to get you bro
---
I cant win anything because im not trying hard enough! 
---
Look, theres another game out there that has a similar name but totally different from this, and meant for you.
---
BFA!!!! 💯💯💯💯🤪
---
Really weird how you never explain how that's not the same thing, pretty much have no clue what you're even talking about just used to retail where everyone joins midgame i guess.
---
Edit:  [Oh, this is the type of person i'm talking to.](https://prnt.sc/qatj18)
---
What is BRE?
---
Yea warlocks basically hard counter you uness you are deep feral you may stand a chance.
---
That he will get PvP mounts and possibly rank 14 title with a few hours of gameplay per day. Possibly by playing the battleground of his choice.
---
So many downvotes, so many people have no idea what an AI is...
---
Right? We still have not seen a pair of might boots for the tanks yet. 1 billion druid boots though. We have been storing them for DE for weeks now.
---
Play on a PvE server and don’t join battlegrounds
---
2-3 hours is what it takes to do the dragon part alone as Horde.
---
Then you add a full LBRS run, a Rend run, a full UBRS run, another full UBRS run and a couple times of running all over Desolace to find Rexxar
---
you all seem to forget that this is an mmo and at the end of the day the only thing that really matters for progression is how many hours you put in. if a solo player wants to put in 14+ hours everyday for months mindlessly grinding AV then it shouldn’t be a problem that they get rank 14. stop crying.
---
Let’s be real, this. “dream” will end when BWL hits and your raid needs to be actually competent because there are mechanics involved. I think we’ll see many guilds that bring meme specs fall apart. A “spell hunter”. Lmfao
---
Ally can instaque premade WSG for honor they are there purely for rep.
---
requires you to have the key probably
---
Yep, never going in there again. Enjoy!
---
Fel dom
---
Ya, just using it as an example to make the point.
---
🤫
---
Horde side warriors should not be allowed to roll on swords till rogues get them for the good of the raid, 2hs and axes are better
---
In 15 molten cores we have had 1 mageblade and 3 staff of domination and 3 chokers. We have had 2 ingots. On the other hand we have 2 sets of bindings and I won one of the staves so I can't complain
---
Haha is this mine bg?Also had horde defend summon everything and make an epic push to win in around 45 mins ! Love those AV's ,they are fun unlike zerg. If you wanna get those then playing defense is the key
---
There’s a Tauren warrior on Smolderweb that wears the full T0 Druid set for the LOLs.
---
why doesn't it work now?
---
In current content, that will change with bwl as swords become more plentiful
---
I'm working on western plaguelands quests while waiting for AV. Annoying to run up each time but does help manage a 8-10 minute queue.
---
Human warrior
---
I’m very happy I got this shit grind out of the way in 2 days.
---
Bet!
---
&gt;The alliance need to run past and ignore them
---
And this is what I see happening. 1/2 the team dies on the way, because everyone is just ignoring them so they can easily pick off 1/2 the team. Then the horde D come south and wipe the rest. How do you account for this? The main failure I see is not getting enough to the base to begin with. But not because they stop and fight midfield, it because horde attack them midfield. Getting attacked and then just try to keep running south = certain death.
---
What if there are no alliance on my server?
---
i wonder if we’re in the same guild? our situations are eerily similar. I would have quit a long time ago for a dkp based system. however, 3 of my irl friends are in the guild and i only am really interested in doing content with them. i will likely just end up quitting altogether once i’m out of steam.
---
Queue time is only about 5 minutes on Horde side, maybe about 10 mins on early mornings.
---
That crescent is a buggy mess though. Took me 2 hours to actually turn it in
---
Warriors?
---
Anything to drive down the price of those things would be OK in my book.
---
100g for a 2hr buff is such a steep cost. If it was 60-75g I would probably not feel like breaking bank every time I pop one.
---
We've had 7 Perdition's Blades but 0 Viskag, Deathbringer, BRE, Mageblade, Aurastone Hammer and only 1 SoD and 2 CHT. We're pretty light on weapons overall, especially as we've been splitting Ony forever and we've not had a single weapon from her, it's getting a little depressing lol.
---
Incendious is fairly balanced, during the entire world pvp stint alliance controlled many of the zones like dire mail/epl/azshara. They also camped the bulwark and outside UC regularly. But it felt like a good balance, idk about trusting the census data some ppl claim to have.
---
It's nice, but I've far more fights for being able to drink  and have a extra thousand Mana compared to a small aoe stun.
---
Warstomp is great, no doubt, but I wouldn't switch :).
---
You rolled Horde i guess, you got to steamroll for 4 weeks. Now you pay the price. 
---
Except EU horde, Blizz just added the russians to the battlegroups because, no changes right...
---
When you force a turtle, don’t be surprised when you get a turtle.
---
Sucks to suck.
---
good warlocks are carrying MC
---
The grind didn't get worse on the 10th.  It got easier.  More people will pvp now, so the brackets get larger.  But they are casual players. So they will do a few bgs then log.  If you felt like you needed to grind 18/7 on the 9th, then you will need to grind 18/7 now.
---
It doesn’t stack with WF, and will prevent you from getting the WF buff for the duration of the stone.
---
~~Flamelash~~ Earthasker's Alliance
---
Maybe in a few years when people aren't grinding 24/7.
---
Hmm but wont the horde also be reaching exalted and not going anymore?
---
What are some good gold farming methods as a Druid if I don't have my professions leveled high?
---
Are DM:E jump runs or tanking live strat with an orb reserved the best gold per hour? Anything else that is good and doesn't use professions?
---
Yes I know I'm missing out a lot without gathering profs but I didn't keep them caught up leveling to 60, and I'd rather get the 600g for the AV mount without leveling them up. Thanks!
---
As a horde today i did 8 won 6 lost 2. Defending is the key.Is there an addon that will track win loss stats of bgs or something ?
---
Congrats on showing everyone you have zero clue how the honor system works lmao.
---
I never played horde while attunements were around, never thought about this. What is the horde version even? Alliances is all about revealing her hiding out standing next anduin in SW keep. What is the horde relation to ony?
---
From my experience when I was hotw/ns spec i was always middle of the pack with our healers, partially because our other druid is rejuv prio,once i swapped to moonglow spec im consistently top 3 (with our other tank heal druid)
---
I'm a Rogue and we've had 7 Perdition's Blades, so I'm fine, but our Mages are a few weeks away from getting the rope.
---
You will spend 2-3 hours looking for Rexxar alone.
---
This is a really good explanation. I might make a Druid next. I am having trouble getting into cloth classes and melee classes. I really like hybrid classes (even if they’re lesser. Makes it more fun when I beat ppl). Are there any other hybrid classes?
---
Yes, too deep. I had so much gold and now I just have a pile of dusty iron.
---
Probably more of a social interaction question than wow specific, but how do you deal with guildies who talk too much? 
---
We have this guy in our guild who would go off tangents the moment he finds himself in a conversation. For example, when someone in guild talked about swiftthistle going up in price, he'd list out nearly every herb and talk about their market conditions. The other day we did a poll in Discord on how many douses we have on hand for MC on that night, and the poll was immediately buried by 20+ lines of messages from him talking about getting to &amp; from the island in Azshara, how the re-usable version isn't in the game yet, every single alchemy recipe he can make (because someone else was asking who can make GFPP), and market conditions for every one of these alchemy products he listed. He also talked a lot in MC trying to explain boss mechanics even though our RL was already doing it. He couldn't articulate himself very well in voice chat and it was holding up 39 people's time.
---
This guildie is overall a decent and non-toxic person, and I'm sure he isn't doing this to annoy people on purpose, but it has become a real chore to interact with him. How do we tell him that he needs to tone it down, without making ourselves sound like rude assholes?
---
The moment min/maxing becomes a 'culture', is the moment it's gone too far. I'd rephrase your idea if I were you.
---
Fuck you shut up
---
What are you using them for? Not really any content right now that calls for them.
---
That’s not at all what I said. 
---
&gt; solo players shouldn’t be rewarded. 
---
No, I said that solo players shouldn’t be rewarded *more quickly than players teaming together*. My comment has no bearing on a solo player getting rank 14. Go for it. It’s just a crying shame that he is able to do it *before the people playing as a premade in a team-based social game.*
---
&gt; They’re there for premades to stomp. 
---
I made no mention of pubstomping in my comment. You’re just projecting others’ comments on me now to add appeal to your own by generalizing this into an “us” vs. “them”.
---
Dunno, didn't have a look to see what server he played on. I met him in an AV. Hope someone shows him this thread.
---
&gt; it’s the fact that minmaxers denounce anyone who doesn’t use their play style
---
You mean like all the people who cry that minmaxers are bad and toxic and "playing the game wrong" ?
---
So whats the alliance strategy if horde stops the zerg? (other than turtle - asking for a friend.)
---
and you sound like one of the many cowards that I will absolutely delete once I get r14 I dont know why I'm even taking time to comment rn I gotta get back to my 18hr days.
---
Not that interesting. How many people clear MC every week?
---
If you look for these kind of things you will find them.
---
Big props for stronghold music.
---
I'm the only priest in my guild whose heals aren't like 80% flash heals and am usually the highest dispeller by a large margin (I only dispel the shit I'm supposed to like ancient dread, soul burn or whatever its called, spefic boss ones, and the all that shit on the tanks). I'm pretty sure I do terrible on all parses but the boss fights that last a little longer like domo and rag. No one cares I'm low on the parses because were not idiots though.
---
In a loot council system, it probably goes to good mages first, then good warlocks, then bad mages.
---
Horde or Alliance though?
---
Horde queue times would likely drop that figure, but damn I want pre made WSG to be the meta :(
---
I agree. I really like my leadership and guild but if we can't sort this out soon I'll sadly have to find a loot council guild. I put in a lot of work and gold for consumes and it just sucks knowing I'll be umdergeared for bwl AND my guild will get stumped
---
preach!
---
That would make sense I’ve never understood how it works
---
Lol epic l33t trolling lmfao.
---
Then the guides online are crap because they have a North and South route for him.
---
Any tips? I'm only nearing 60 on my main just now
---
Also the fact that there are some items like recipes that are available to one faction and not the other.
---
This bought back the memory of the good old days when Eviscerate did static (and very high) damage. That amazing feeling where you have a full dungeon set and...a naked rogue with a lvl 1 gray quality dagger opens you up like a tin of tuna, because your trinket and bubble are on cooldown, without you having even a chance to fight back because you're CCed from 100% to 0%. Good times!
---
So many flash heal snipers topping the charts :(
---
I mean id put it like this... there are currently 2 1h swords in the game that rogues could get while there are 3 servicable 2hs for warrs and deathbringer, all of which are uncontested by the rogues. So let the rogues get the swords first so ur whole raid is using epic items
---
How did this work out for you? We have tried more than 20 times, 2 people never got in the same bg
---
You don't stack spell crit? That was the impression I got from guild warlocks, high parses rely on crit and luck?
---
you are 100% correct. bottom of the list sorted by killing blows.... quality shit post.
---
Sulfuras is great, horde have a slight advantage in number but alliance is competitive (have gotten the majority of world boss kills)
---
Did you make sure its reading the right graphics card. Under advanced settings i think
---
Clearly you’ve never ranked before. *The goal is to be able to stop grinding before the end of each week.* No br1 premade is still grinding honor the night before a reset. 
---
Tell me, how many times have you done the grind to rank 14? What server are you on now? What bracket is your premade hitting? This will be my third rank 14—one in vanilla and one on northdale. I’m on a competitive server full of private server guilds that try hard. I have been bracket 1 every week. Please, tell me more about how your vast experience has led you to believe that after going bracket 5+ for the past 4 weeks, some antisocial bracket breaker who did not spend 300g/day during wpvp ranking should be able to take bracket 1-2 spots from my premade, all for the price of 0g.
---
Thanks for the info! That’s what i figures.
---
Kick your furies and recruit some good ones.
---
"old AV" wouldn't stop people from rushing it.
---
All I'm hearing is "mimimimimi".
---
I'm Alch/Engi, actually making a reasonable amount of gold off the AH. Just takes time and I can't sink all my gold into a mount without losing the base gold I need to make gold...
---
If you know 2 stacks usually sell and the rest don't, then just post two at a time until you don't have any more. You now know what the demand for iron bars is, the bad part is you can't really make more than that.
---
8 weeks of full MC clears and we've seen only 2 ingots, 2 staves, 2 mageblades, and no ToEP. Nearly every single week it's just warlock, hunter, and druid gear. Our new hunters are getting absolutely spoiled with loot.
---
Night elf druids are usually pricks though, at least from what I’ve seen on Sulfuras. But male night elf anything seems highly likely to attack, especially the hunters. Good lord make night elf hunters are obnoxious with their emote spam.
---
The goal is not the reality you fucktard
---
if you are letting solo players get even close to you then you suck. that's that
---
The more games the harder it is.  So if you’re on a really heavy server it might not work at all.  We’re on Windseeker a nonfull pve server and it gets annoying at primetime
---
You fo real? Druid is like the least played class and the most dropped set. All the Druids that ever stepped into a raid with us were half done with their set after the first raid.
---
How can I go about joining AV premades?
---
I was in a (so they told me) AV premade with 23 people yesterday, from a couple different servers. Whitemane was one of them. It was the smoothest AV I had ever done - 10 mins, killing galv, then taking FW gy, then RH gy, then killing drek. I didn't even die once. I didn't even get attacked when defending FW gy, so it may have been that the horde were particularly incompetent that game, but still.
---
I asked them how and they said they coordinate queuing over discord. Where can I go to get in on this? It's way better than trying my luck solo.
---
I'd have to drop Alchemy. My guild has Engineering as a requirement. Could dump alch for herb, but then would need to herb enough for my consumable costs + extra gold on top.
---
Peon?  In my day we just called it a golden shower.
---
I love doing this on mine! I wish I could make him sneak around like that like how you can toggle walk.
---
T1 is great for PvP, if your balance/resto at least
---
True, but we also usually lose despite having WAY more honor (in my experience).  It's a tradeoff.  The Alliance get more rep, and we get more honor.
---
The only way warriors should even be considered for swords is if they already have edgemasters. In bwl all the best wpns are swords but id never give those to a warr not wearing edgies cuz not worth. Once bwl hits and there are twice as many weapons to go around its less bad to let warrs have them
---
1.12 didn't last that long, Vanilla was out for a LONG time before the major AV nerfs resulted in this hot mess.
---
This system works great with a slice of loot council for your highest value items.
---
We used a pure +1 loot system but switched to the system above after the lowest performing players started winning all the high impact items (ToEM, Staff of Dominance, Viskag)
---
Now items deemed a "significant impact" are rolled between a selected pool of players to ensure they end up in the right hands.
---
Literally unplayable... From the system tray.
---
I know I play alliance there. Sulfuras is 59/41 though and that’s almost 50% more horde so I wouldn’t really call that a slight advantage, but yeah alliance are competitive because they have all the top guilds(except limitless on horde)
---
I'm just stacking up for bwl. Popped one on our speedrun for MC, where we spammed swiftness pots, mana pots on CD to avoid as much drinking as possible etc.
---
It's the only one I've popped so far.
---
Nice dodge, rat
---
arcanist bindings 20dkp. can i join ur guild
---
I miss playing WoW with my friends
---
What add on is that that shows the gear score?
---
It does! I’ve seen some hordies in Lightforge gear in battlegrounds. Also had quite a lot of shammy tier 0 drop in dungeons even though I’m alliance.
---
Oomathurman
---
no it will work like shit, only resetting the weaponswingtimer, not giving you an extra attack like it says.
---
SSPVP on curseforge
---
i see thank you, btw do u know where i can turn in all my scraps?
---
I didn’t get the point you were trying to make. Although I do feel bad for you Druid if you thing getting a lot of Cenarion pieces is getting geared.
---
Life of Brian. Love that movie
---
The queue times depended on your bg, they werent the same across all servers.
---
Trust me perception finds stealthed people. Its not garbage for that.
---
So people are communicating and working together in an mmo and you don't like it. 
---
Ever consider maybe MMOs aren't for you?
---
Your tin foil is too tight mong.
---
I'm on the same boat! I got a lucky world drop and can afford my mount but i have been asking around about moneymaking andbhave a couple ideas. 
---
1. Start a Strat Live Groups and say the orbs are on reserve....even if you dont need them. This is probably and unethical life tip.
---
2. Drop skinning and pick up herb, I think DM:E has a bunch of good herbs but someone could correct me. 
---
3. Questing in EPL and WPL can still be pretty profitable. 
---
4. If you want to keep skinning go get devilsaur leather. 
---
5. Make good friends with a tank and sell people runs thru dungeons.
---
why are you even playing, i wonder
---
\*playing a game from 15 years ago you are only playing again now because your bored with modern but still need your wow fix\*
---
Night elf hunters were legendarily awful back in vanilla. WoW rode in on the back of the LOTR craze, and every preteen with an attitude rolled an NE hunter named something like Leggolaas.
---
1. It’s a rush, the alliance must try their best to avoid any conflict in the middle and get to horde base ASAP. Many horde in the middle usually means their base is empty (unless they all turtle which is unlikely), at least 20-25 alliance get to RH will be highly possible to get a win.
---
2. If half of your team die in the middle due to bad luck or wrong path, then the rush is certainly failed. There’s nothing you can do. Either go after Galv and AFK or just play it normally. 
---
3. Pick up a fight with horde in the middle is just the way how people play AV in the good old days. Make sure you convince your allies not to rush at the start of the game, otherwise some people rush and some people fight will result in a certain loss.
---
You can get in the white mane discord and see if you can find any extra info there
---
dejastats has an ilvl option
---
Yeah exactly, this is classic
---
Kromcrush could use some horde but it's nearly 50-50
---
165
---
"Wouldn't it be amazing if everyone just did what I want to do." This subreddit in a nutshell.
---
Yup I think I need to take a break from this sub it’s honestly too much. There’s no discussion here it’s just toxic users that don’t even read comments before replying with their own crazy narratives.
---
Haven’t tried wsg yet I was under the impression wsg was way less honor than av?
---
that is raid dps i said it is higher in dungeons
---
May be being thick this doesn't seem to be a choice there is character frame I've already disabled yet its still skinned.
---
He is a new player and feeling good about playing his class reasonably well. Dont shit on him for thanking the community. Parses above 95 also require that ur whole raid be on point so the fights dont last too long. It feels good to have fun playing with friends and having logs that reflect good performance. Im sure u have never parsed below 100% tho bro. Go swing ur untouched micropenis somewhere else
---
Its far from a sandbox. Its a true theme park MMO. I agree with you that BGs are boring solo but not much we can do. I just unsubbed had fun while it lasted :)
---
It is, I use ElvUI and it's the best.
---
You're right.  It is a sandbox. Kinda. And it's also an mmo. If you want to work with others and dominate the fuck out of that sandbox,  that's also part of the game. 
---
If you don't like that,  it's not the games problem. It's yours.
---
I’m from incendious alliance, it seems we win like 70% of the time but horde always gets way more honor
---
I seen them posted on he sulfuras discord on Tuesday when they re-worked the census addon again. Keep in mind it’s obviously not 100% accurate but it’s the best we can go by. I can try to find a link to the discord post when I’m off work.
---
Generally 3 options that my guilds have done in the past
---
1. Tell him. He'll probably whine, keep telling him.
---
2. Put him on ignore, he'll start getting confused when nobody responds to him and if its like the last guy I dealt with, he'll get really depressed and gquit.
---
3. Mercilessly insult and mock everything he comments on, he'll get tired of opening his mouth.
---
Interesting. They're just paying 45/month to make gold, lol? Really curious if anyone here does this and how much they make!
---
Also my face when I have to fight as undead rogue as a lock
---
I’m pretty sure the loot is decided by who participated in the kill, then if greens or whatever drop they are rolled on by the whole raid
---
Thank you for your insightful contribution.
---
Queued with 10-15 people for 2 days and killed Galv in most of them, lost one game, its not hard if everyone is on the same page.  The problem arises when half the group goes to Galv and half say fuck you and go straight to Drek.
---
R u experienced with SL build? I wanna try it out but dont know if after SL ruin or affli tree is the way to go
---
You think you do, but you don't...

Go with a 10 man premade squad, 6-7 minute games.

This was the first person. Not the millionth.

Gay
---
U can solo anger. It's very very easy. But a slower kill. As a rogue i use a handy bow  with dooms hot from LBRS.
---
&gt;If you are not rank 8-9 this week already then please for everyone's sake accept that you have no chance to get R11-R14 within the next couple of weeks.  
---
More people need to understand this. R14 isn't something you just wake up and decide to do, you need a toilet you can sit on while playing, a bucket of adderall, and someone giving you nutrients through an IV. That doesn't even cover the politics and networking needed.
---
The only thing worse than the "no changes" crowd are the people who continue to bring them up
---
but alliance on pve server is no problem. if you want to downvote me because i pointed out how many alliance quit because of the imbalance, fine by me
---
This is like jerking off on being mythic on arena,  diamond 4 in lol or divine in dota. 
---
And it is especially bad in wow classic parses on which a lot depends on how much you care about parses and is not even a real competition.
---
You can ride face smasher into the 20s mh iirc
---
[https://youtu.be/8FUfYEnMUDM](https://youtu.be/8FUfYEnMUDM) \- If you bring more than 4 druids to a raid, crazy shit always happens. This video is over 14 years old but still rings true today :D
---
yikes guess whos penis is small
---
Ahh I misunderstood. Gotcha now.
---
Are you sure it is helmet/chest/pants and not just the shoulders? The shoulders are on another loot slot. The bosses dropping helmet/chest/pants always drop a random D1 piece, so that loot slot might be handled like T1 slots (prevents shaman for ally, pally for horde).
---
Fine don't do. You're the one who respecced already and started whining. Here I am telling you how to fix it. Fuck you.
---
I agree with you 100% this is the stupidest shit I’ve ever seen.
---
same issue
---
According to forums and reddit, I was supposed to sit in 4hr queues to be completely destroyed and farmed by the l33t Alliance players.
---
The world is pretty much empty now that those who are trying to pvp are doing bgs for honor. So dont see why you shouldnt.
---
WhY wOuLdN’t YoU tRiNkEt ThE fEaR iNsTaNtLy?
---
Forgetting an item is the worst, or failing to realize you need it until crafting time.  Idk how many times I’ve done that /sigh and ran back to AH (or bank) to get that handful of shadowgem’s I needed for that recipe.
---
Because it’s a good game and I enjoy playing it.
---
Now go away
---
I tried fixing this for so long and just want to say you made my day. Thank you so much.
---
That is the original AV though, not the BC crap version we are playing now.
---
Yeah, I am rushing AV as horde for that reason.
---
10 faction Capitol rep, 1 frostwolf rep.
---
You should have no problem with wpvp. Death squads are nonexistent unless they are purposefully griefing. Can't comment on group availability though
---
Noice
---
It's the only way the horde wins, dragging it out a bit longer. Sometimes the offense can't get it together so it takes a really long time at that point.
---
Ally have insta-queue rn, horde do not so winning with extra rep is worth it.
---
Except you’ve bothered the person that you invited.  So close, but not quite.
---
And I say that tongue in cheek.  This is a nice trick.  Thanks for sharing.
---
If long bgs resulted in purples they probably would.
---
So youre telling me a macro that only does /startattack works? i find that hard to believe but ok, guess if its worth insulting me over that must mean youre for real..
---
When people talk about progression guilds they're talking about guilds in contention for sever 1st. If your definition of a progression guild is any guild trying to complete raids than most guilds are progression guilds.
---
If pugs are completing more content than your progression guild then you're not in a progression guild.
---
Eyyy fellow blaumeuxers, Ally Rogue here =)
---
Glad your having fun dude
---
we cant even sell it anymore
---
last T2 druid head only went for 100g
---
Because you dared to say classic isn't perfect.
---
Ah, you might be right! Now that I think about it, the only shammy gear I’ve seen drop are shoulders!
---
This seems like a really good idea. Getting no drops is really discouraging.
---
My guild does something similar. If you have pre raid weapons, you can roll on daggers or swords when they drop, but when you win one, you’re committed to that specialty until everyone else has the weapons they’re after.
---
This led to me being one of only 2 sword rogues in my
---
Guild because so many gutgore daggers dropped and the other 5 rogues wanted them over waiting for a sword drop.
---
The only exception to this is if the dagger gloves drop and you win them you’re committed to daggers, and if the nightslayer gloves drop and you get them, you’re committed to swords.
---
I really enjoy this way of doing it because spec makes a huge difference with daggers and swords so someone using a dagger and a sword is not taking advantage of the weapons as much as someone with two of either.
---
Be a cool dude and save your rend head turn in for raid nights!
---
Mooo bitch, you are my prey.
---
That shit happened to my friend on his lvl 50 warrior, but with the savage glad chest.
---
He has no idea what he has, couldn't even equip it due to lvl.
---
Being able to complete quests and grind rep isn't torture to me. It's the way the BG was meant to be played. But noooo, players always have to suck the life out of the game by zerg rushing.
---
Gotta get that max honor/hr! -_-
---
Can answer all ur questions effortlessly and efficiently with: reroll it gets better.
---
Intimidating Shout is the fear. There is a cooldown on that for sure.
---
I assume you are thinking of the talent in fury called piercing howl that slows the enemies around you. Either that or demoralizing shout, that reduces attack power of enemies around you.
---
I did my bitching back then lol.. why pay lots of money to get mad at what I love lol flaws and all. Merry Christmas!
---
The person you invite is already in a party they wont actually get the invite, just a small text on the chat log.
---
I wasn't doing that before.
---
53 minute loss yesterday where the Horde didn't even pretend to try to win, they just left all the flags uncapped and farmed half the raid at Stormpike GY.
---
Never doing that shit again.
---
But, isn't that what every other class does? Hunters don't pick between bows/guns, casters don't pick between staffs or main and off hand, warriors roll for everything under the sun.
---
I didn't even say i wanted any changes, i just asked if it would quell the complaints
---
I appreciate the input, thanks!
---
If you're talking about the message you get when someone tries to invite you when you're in a group, that's not a thing in Classic.
---
That's exactly how i feel it should work
---
I know. "go back to retail" is the normal counter to not caring what was actually said.   Guy who said it is a dick, basically.  It's like "you're a Nazi" or "ok Boomer" to just dismiss any discussion.
---
I hear you.  Pre-mades for either BG will always be the preferred way to stay efficient.  But they are also a smaller segment of the players.  Especially for AV since it's harder to guarantee your group all gets in.
---
I was talking more for the AV pugs.
---
WSG requires a premade and near 100% win rate to be slightly worse than AV Solo que where you lose 50%.
---
As a mage, if I am not at full health/mana, I usually just sit still and wait to die because fuck putting in effort to prolong my inevitable death.
---
Why is PvP happening in a battleground?  Are we really asking THIS now?  3 weeks ago it was "I dIdNt KnOw pVp WaS gOiNg To bE hApPeNiNg oN a PvP sErVer!??!?!?" Are you asking why horde isn't flopping over and taking a fast loss?  It's a battleground, and it's PvP.  I'd rather have a 25 minute win than a 10 minute loss honestly, its way more fun knowing that we folded the allies over backwards on their usual winning strategy.  Plus it makes snowflakes run to the forums and cry about it.
---
I mean, I consider this pretty  big #changes in it's current form.
---
Playing in AV by myself for the entire honor grind with no other option isn't #nochanges
---
Me not that kind of Orc.
---
Your guild is 100% correct on doing this. You need to pick what you enjoy playing more. If you like combat sword spec then stick with it and allow someone that likes sub or assassination dagger spec. 
---
Your issue is that it sounds like you are not sure what spec you like. I would suggest researching the pros and cons of each spec for classic, and learn what kind of play style they have.
---
Not really. Still unplayable with queues popping faster than i can exit town. #literallyunplayable
---
&gt; its 43/57 which isnt really balanced
---
....so if it's not perfect 50/50, it's "not really balanced" ?
---
Considering that there are tons of pvp servers that are 70:30, 80:20 or worse, I'd say 43:57 is very well balanced.
---
It absolutely makes sense, and any guild that doesn't do this is inviting drama and fights.
---
Because you want changes in a game, which specifically was asked to be brought back without any.
---
That is decent just for pugs. Seems terrible for a guild
---
Got a priest named Kimjongheals in retail. Also a rogue that goes by Knifetomeetu.    
---
Not using them in classic atm tho :)
---
https://imgur.com/a/Mh8ODWi
---
I guess you must have missed the first 2.5 months of the sub telling everyone to roll need on all BoEs that drop
---
Good point! Didn’t make the connection that anybody in SM is almost certainly already in a group.
---
What class is a counter to Warlocks in Pvp?
---
No, it just confirms to me that you’re a fucking moron.  It doesn’t make me mad at all.
---
Back then(or maybe still now, haven't looked for a raid guild yet) pretty much every guild that was already raiding advertised that you needed to be ony attuned prior to applying.
---
You don't have to disable them, right click the bg icon on your mini map and select enter battle
---
Get a guild with a well implemented dkp/epgp system.
---
I was an awful preteen night elf hunter named Dracotheft
---
Nobody will be able to provide accurate stats since we only have third party sites that get their data from whether bothers to upload what one of 2 census addons found on their server and faction.
---
So keep that in mind.
---
Yep, some of the annoying trash it's just easier not to risk losing buffs to a RNG death from something stupid.  Especially the Wardens before you get to Ony, my favorite mobs to skill up ranged weapons lol.
---
I'm in the same position. I have no raid weapons and just using swords, because it is the best option available for me right now. I'd go for either swords or daggers when I get a raid upgrade. Luckily my guild is using a dkp system. So I can just bid on them when it drops, without anybody whining about how I currently specced for another weapon type.
---
They don't play to win.
---
By the time Balinda is dead they're already capping relief GY.
---
I mean, they do less DPS than warriors, rogues, and mages. Unless the mage is playing some potato spec and doesn't know how to properly press frostbolt or aoe for 3 fights
---
2-3 for the full thing, lol, sometimes Alliance doesn't realize how sweet they have it.
---
Assuming you get a full guild group, 2-3 hours is just the middle part of it, you have to also run 4 instances + 1 hour of traveling around to find rexxar a couple of time and go to plaguelands.
---
Mage?
---
Meanwhile we just wrapped up our 14th week of raiding with 0 toeps.
---
You wouldn't fight him either
---
We've disenchanted atleast 6 full sets of it. Its all we get.
---
Why do you say specifically next two years sir?
---
&gt; So if AV is being enjoyed any other way than how you think it should be ran you AFK like a child? BIG MAN
---
Not the person you're responding too, but I'll say this. I love long AV's. I have a ton of fun in long AV's. I would prefer this to be an older version of AV.. 
---
But I don't enjoy being in a turtle where half the group is raging at the other half as no one can communicate / agree on what to do. If a group is intentionally turtling, and another is getting riled by that, I'd rather take the 15 min debuff and hope for a better game after.
---
Thanks for all the info I'll definitely use some of these when I'm not doing group content.
---
Which 1 or 2 of these would you say is the best gold maker?
---
Yeah that's how many people get cutting edge, that isn't how many people are actively raiding mythic. There are a little over 6000 guilds in NA with at least 1 heroic boss kill, 2300 of those guilds have a mythic kill and about 200 of those have killed Azshara.
---
I'm currently 0 for 4 trying to get water this way.  And of course, nobody will ever give water if I ask at the start of the BG.
---
I just instantly leave if I fail to check the AV first and join a turtle. 
---
More fun and more honor to fly to Thorium point and pick off the people on 60% mounts that think world PvP is over.
---
Spelllock shadow school
---
I got 77k honor by playing around 6 hours of AV
---
I'd never join a guild that rolled items off. But that's just me.
---
Really depends on the spec of the lock and what pet he has out when the rogue goes for the kill. Duels a lock will win 80% of the time, but out in the open rogues have a higher chance to gank a lock.
---
All bosses in MC are immune.
---
It’s details
---
It wasn't sneer, you asked for advice and I gave it to you. Let me guess, you're one of those priests who just chase BIS lists without thinking and end up with less than 5k mana unbuffed?
---
I don't go OOM because I have plenty of spirit, mana per 5 and Int. I bet you however will go OOM straight away in Lucifron and Geddon when you're doing as much dispelling as healing and your +500 healing does jack squat.
---
Oh btw, you need more than 3.2k HP buffed otherwise you will get 1-shotted by pyroclast barrages.
---
i so agree with you, its beyond crazy to me that parsing is even a thing in classic
---
Still hasn’t worked for me. What a pain in the arse.
---
100% agree. My biggest thing about why I love classic.
---
Ahh good to know, thanks
---
Even though the person you try to invite will never know, i still dont like it. You are using this random person for your own benefit and thats not how a person should act.
---
Uhhh min maxing will ALWAYS be meta since that's kind of what meta means lol
---
If you’re having a hard time with luci and geddon, then yea.  Most people don’t.
---
Going against the grain and saying that's ridiculous. A raiding rogue chooses their spec after they get a weapon not before. Warriors need brutality blade and such fair, but they have stuff they can roll on us rogues cannot. Things like deathbringer, OEB, BRE, etc. This is particularly messed up if fury warrs aren't restricted in such a fashion. 
---
I'd find a new guild
---
I agree up to a point. There is merit in having people pick assuming everyone shows up all the time and that is loot distribution. If you have the same team every week I can understand trying to split it up but mostly I think it should go this way.
---
#nochanges :p
---
I have the same problem with another addon that shwos reagent count since this BG release.
---
clicking stealth doesn't unstealth in classic (at least I don't think, it's never worked for me) you have to make a /removeaura macro
---
I have the same problem with bartender after the most recent patch.
---
they are not that far apart
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#metric=dps&amp;dataset=95&amp;class=DPS
---
AV on opening day was 1 or 2 minute queues.  Last night it was more like 5 or 6 minutes.  The longest I've ever waited was 6 minutes.
---
Uhh, yeah... "strong."
---
That's a stupid comparison.  It isn't luck and probability that keeps the Horde from winning.  It's lack of desire.  Stop trying to race and play the game. 
---
It was never supposed to be a race.  Stop the raid between the tower and the graveyard by Galv.  Kill everyone.  Advance and capture.  Repeat until victory.

Thats an asshole move.
---
Place a portal and hope for the best :)))
---
I've been winning more than losing since yesterday as horde.
---
What is warsong like?
---
Up to 10 minutes for AV all alliance got exalted stopped queuing was 2 minutes first day
---
Er what? Is this a trick question? If you mean mage arcane explosion then it’s a mage spell, not hunter.
---
I'm sure it's great honor farming for the streamer, they're the one who decides which match to enter and everyone tries to get in with them.  But especially now that they can't vote kick people before it starts, I can't see it being very good for most of his other "helpers".  I wonder what the percent rate is for how many of their team can regularly get the same battle now.
---
But yeah, if you're focusing one person to push R14 it's good.  And everyone else gets what they can.
---
How are you queueing with others?
---
Just wait for snowballs
---
&lt;.&lt;
---
And this is why you don't run a DKP no limits (ex)guild.
---
Mograine or Ashbringer.
---
Playing defense does not mean turtle.
---
Well the guy who died 23 times must have been in the game for atleast 10 minutes
---
This is why we didn't want 1.12 AV
---
Rogues and hunters that open first are hard, a good rogue is pretty much unwinnable. Of course if you get the jump on a rogue they have no shot at killing you and can only hope to Sprint away and disengage. Warriors have the ability to one-shot you if you’re not SL but if they don’t it’s game over.
---
As an SM/Ruin warlock I’m running around with my Felhunter 99% of the time. SL locks should be rolling with the pup at least 80% of the time too. VW, especially as SL, can make warrior/rogue much easier but any warlock that pretends they’ll have void out any time they get jumped is a liar lol.
---
It’s shared no matter where you are.
---
Horde salty that the PvP tides have turned?
---
I am already dotted up by the time I get a chance to do that.
---
DME is our most profitable dungeon and you have to have mining. You can then take herb for random ghost mushrooms or if you like to open world farm. If you plan on farming solely in DME, then tailoring will be your best second profession because you get a lot of demonic runes that you can turn into gear for money. But If you think you may do some mara or just want to pick herbs when out in the world, definitely take herb as your second profession.
---
Is playing a different game for you if you're unhappy with it not an option?
---
Meant plan, obviously.
---
no also the people on the top had 0 honor, its just that there were no alliance on the top
---
You'll be one of the few to have a hard time then.
---
Assuming this takes at least 12 minutes it would be a decent bit quicker to get someone to invite one of your alts to the party and log reset
---
I play on Bloodsail Bucs NA as a horde.   There is not much random RP going on. There are guilds that schedule events and I've occasionally run across things happening in Brill and X-roads inn, but for the most part it's just a normal pve server.  Definitely more alliance than horde on the server, but hard to say what the exact ratio is.
---
Do you know if a hunter who wasn't in the raid can come in and loot the chest for it?
---
First of all what race rogue are you?
---
I love boot bay, never been to rio but that’s what’s I imagine 😂
---
I can't play this 15 year old game the way I want to play it, something has got to change!
---
I’ve done like 15 MCs and never seen a single Onslaught Girdle. Meanwhile, another raid in my guild got 3 in the last 4 weeks.
---
I wouldn't leave. I'd contact the guild master let them know what you told us and if nothing changes then I'd leave. I would leave them with a feeling that you know you've been done dirty I'm sure if you can stop dps another guild will gear you up in 1 run
---
Hi, I’m an alliance rogue and I have cable.

I’m an undead rogue, and you’re running back to your corpse.
---
Seconded. I’ve played since TBC and I admit I have no damn clue what this parsing nonsense means.
---
Yeah there's more DCs since the patch
---
Im fishing in AV, right now it seems i can catch the nightfin fish just as easy without a lure than with a lure. If I have 300 fishing already, should I just casual fish there? Meaning no lures or w/e? Cant tell the difference
---
If ur raiding on tuesdays try a different day.
---
Arcanist did not have spell penetration at release.
---
Thanks gents!
---
What does it matter when they started their progress? They could be competing for server first for all I know. In the context of the post, progression obviously refers to them not overgearing the content.
---
Coming from Thrall a shaman without healing spells!
---
&gt; They could stop it by saying it’s not allowed and taking action to stop it just like they do to people who purchase gold from third party sources.
---
What action? 
---
Gold selling isn't really something they can prevent. They can stop bots farming, but they can't really stop one person gifting money to another.
---
&gt; allowing people to exchange real money for gold is unacceptable.
---
Is it? I don't think it happens with enough quantity for it to upset market prices.
---
I was thinking it might be a percentage of what your class is capable of doing for DPS? So if I hit 95% that means I am utilizing my class and spec to a high level. I’m wondering if this is the idea
---
You act like the alliance don't have to run LBRS and UBRS as well
---
Omg this is great. I love seeing my enemies with this look on their face
---
I'm disappointed it didn't say "head" instead
---
Saturas war wohl schon benutzt, hmm? :P Diego würde zum Schurken doch besser passen
---
The same people had raid groups to camp flight paths and will literally complain about anything so fuck em. If you want to “rank” you do what’s most efficient to rank,  if anyone honestly believed pushing for a serious rank in classic was going to be “fun” then....
---
Good thing it's not a Ret talent then
---
\&gt;pull 6 separate mobs, spreading dots and fear and tanking it all with both me and my demon because I'm a Fel-Empowered GOD
---
\&gt;haha, stupid melee plebs can barely handle 1 mob while leveling, I'm so good at this game, I'm barely dropping below 20% hp with all the self healing and tankiness I have, I love this game so m
---
*&gt;rogue comes out of stealth and literally melees me to finish me off*
---

---
How can you wipe because of a tank parse? Also tank parse is incredibly important, probably the only parse that really matters since it dictates how much damage every dps can do.
---
Sadly leeway makes it harder to kite in this version :(
---
This is the truth.
---
As an alliance warlock, literally every single mage I fight is an undead mage who counters my fears and dots perfectly with double ice block, pvp trinket, shadow reflector and undead racial.  
---
It's like the easiest matchup there is for them. I don't see how you can't beat warlocks as a mage.
---
If your alliance then not bad. But horde dont get your queue times.
---
Drew Scanlon!
---
Yeah this is the dumbest shit I’ve seen lol
---
I would gquit over a hunter winning MB
---
Nice dude. I played as a mage, I use to play with my friends but now I'm the only one remaining. I feel its kinda boring to play alone. But I wish you the best. Have fun!
---
honestly i never have problems with locks as shadow priest, my shadow magics are stronger.
---
Only 30?  I was averaging 45 yesterday.  I was also getting 800+ rep per game though so...
---
As a shadow priest I have no real issues fighting locks.
---
How did you come up with that figure? A win with token turn in is about 250 rep. Neutral to exalted is 42k. I think it's closer to 200 wins.
---
Which you can flame ward.
---
lmao "nonsense"  
---
    
---
Like a grumpy old man "back in my day we didnt even have damage meters"  
---
l0l0
---
/r/relationships stuff here.
---
Sweet, thanks.  Have you found anything of value this way yet?
---
So true. My favorite thing is if I know I'm going to die, the last thing I'm gonna do is try to cast another corruption to make sure you do too.
---
I run with a succubus and full destruction.   If a rogue doesn’t kill me in the opener then normally I’ll beat them.  
---
If they have good skills (not many rogues do tbh) even then it’s a struggle.  
---
Warriors are the same.   If they are geared and get the opener or can break seduce quick I will struggle.  Otherwise the opener is the only damage they will manage.
---
I did upgrade the whole shaman dungeon set to the epic one long time ago on a private server and it was a lot of fun and also a thing you can do by yourself without the need to wait 1 week every time in the hope you get your loot.
---
Diego war leider auch weg, dafür heisst mein Magiertwink Corristo :D
---
Talk to higher officers. Make sure the GM knows. Give them one chance before you leave.
---
With the Souls games, its more about finding a rhythm that won't see you dead, and once you have that, it becomes a lot easier
---
I thought you were me until the part about the bindings. The staff was so nice, and I was more than willing to jump out of that long-ass mageblade queue.
---
Feel like race of rogue also plays into it. UD rogue is much more threatening than gnome rogue, for example
---
Amen to this. The idea of rushing in any game has always excited me.
---
So all of the vitriolic hate towards minmaxers is justified, because....it just is.
---
Got it.
---
When that happens i just spam the fuck out of my food
---
for me it was threatplates and dbm
---
Shadow priest
---
And then there's the SL locks who never lose
---
Seduce hunter.  Fear pet.   Get in close.   Nuke.   Works well but getting in close is absolutely vital to have any chance as a lock.
---
Nothing. It is a different game. Nothing can be plucked from Vanilla/Classic and work in Retail
---
Shadow priest? You mean wannabe warlock?
---
 Was about 15 mins now it's down to about 9 mins but I've had 4/4 games against premades. I guess ally all finished with their AV rep farm. I don't think Horde WSG premades are viable honor at all due to the queues times.
---
Our guild clearing since week 2, and for the last 3 weeks doing 25 man MC splits, has seen exactly 0 ToEP and 0 spellpower rings. This is just the Law of Large Numbers in effect.
---
Seems silly. MC is trivial content.
---
Sure, I drop Foror book and a lot of plants
---
No loot system is perfect, but part of the reason I join a guild is to get away from stuff like that.
---
I think the question you need to ask yourself is 'Is this what I was hoping to achieve in a guild' and if the answer is no then it might be time to move on.  Personally, I want my guild/raid to improve as quickly as possible and progress through the game at our optimal pace, this kind of a loot system would never allow that.
---
He could be Alliance also and going against the very common undead warlock?
---
WSG is my all time least favorite BG, I haven't even tried it yet.
---
That is true and I had not considered the implications
---
This is great news. The 6 min rep farm zoomers meta is ending quicker than I hoped. We are defending again!
---
You need to have your felhunter out. His spell lock / devour magic will ruin their day. Or you can just go soul link and laugh at their pathetic attempts to hurt you.
---
My warlock has 200 Shadow resist, 200 FR and 150 chromatic resists. Makes fighting casters just silly, especially after a Magic Resistance Pot ;)
---
Time to find a new guild
---
No addon. All games have a number. Everyone click Enter Battle at same time, either countdown in Discord or with DBM pulltimer. If everyone gets the same number take the queue. If not, leave queue and try again. If everyone in the group got the same number except one person, they can join the battle in the odd one out scroll all the way to the bottom of the list of every number to look for the number they had and queues for it.
---
Laughs in 200 SR
---
Same shit went with the Caesar series btw. Caesar 3 was fucking great, Caesar 4 just looked so shit you couldn't play it.
---
Cool tip, thanks! Gonna try when I won't be too lazy to tab out and do all that.
---
Don't think Alliance stopped queueing, atleast i'm seeing +- the same amount of AV's the last few day's. I do notice though that Horde is more and more forcing longer games, which i guess will influence queue times as it ties up alliance players longer on average per fresh BG. Was like 10 mins average during the week, now its often up to 20-30 mins per game.
---
That's just terrible guild management, there should be other officers who can step in for master loot duty if the GM needs some time off.
---
At this point you might as well run with pugs, you have the same chance of getting loot and you might end up finding a decent guild that way too.
---
If you're moving to a DKP guild be warned you'll probably need to raid for weeks and weeks before you have enough DKP to win over an existing member. Especially with fixed price DKP system. Not that loot council guild will be much different, you'll need to prove yourself first.
---
There are some DKP systems which are nicer to newer guild members, notably EPGP, suicide DKP and to a lesser extent zero sum. Read up and try finding a guild with your preferred loot mechanism.
---
I came across an almost dead lock running through AV yesterday, it had been a particularly rough match for me so i decided to get a bit of revenge, slap his ass with my staff, little shit hops off of his mount, starts dotting me, starts casting the fear and then i bust out the earth shock. Beautiful.
---
And then one managed to get a fear off for the full 20 seconds. Couple of warriors shredded his ass before he could do much though
---
AV is fucking wild.
---
You bro
---
If both sides don't have engineering and the rogue isn't undead then I dont see a way the warlock can ever lose a set piece battle against a rogue, if they both have engineering then shadow reflect trinket would probably change the entire outcome of the fight 180 degrees.
---
Your helping making phase 2 insufferable for others. Thanks.
---
Letting alliance keep SH GY screws them hard for offense and defense, I dont know how people can't understand that lol.  The only exception would be if they already have Snowfall.
---
MacroToolkit has syntax highlighting and error checking
---
Other 80% of the time is a diff story but let’s just focus on the RNJeezus procs
---
people are only making it harder for themselves, there ally on my server that hit 1mil honor by the 3rd day by the end of the week i predict close to 3mil, their decay is going to be massive. Anyone else that isnt playing as much as them are kidding themselves if they think they getting r14 anytime soon
---
This is what happens when the Alliance either hit exalted, or ragequit when the Horde stops them from getting their ez wins.
---
Damn y... that would make my sw:p tick like it was one of those weak lock dots xd
---
Haha! Now that was hilarious.
---
If you’re soul link spec the rogue really can’t do much even as undead.
---
Can you Eli5? I never played vanilla. What do you mean upgrade it to epic?
---
So the Alliance mages casting from under the ground outside Vann should get banned?
---
I had 3 sets of gear for them, caster+healer and tank and dps.  caster works well enough, but I'd say it wasn't ideal.  It sure was fun hitting that hard with a starfire crit tho.
---
Edit: I should say I did have more fun doing caster I think as there was no one else doing it.  It felt unique.
---
I honestly have nothing against HonorSpy (mainly because I have little interest in PvP other than it being a thing I can do when I am bored) but the troll in me wants to spam fake data.
---
I wonder though what happens when you have someone on ignore and they are sending real data, do you not receive it?
---
Why wouldn't it break your eating buff when it ticks? At least in pve, if I'm poisoned, a poison tick will terminate my food recovery as far as I've experienced.
---
Yea, there are tons of people losing intentionally to avoid a turtle  - you know, actually playing the game.
---
My guess is he meant Piercing since he was talking mostly about slows.
---
Next level griefing. 
---
Seriously, though, what's your problem with HonorSpy? It'll tell people at which point they can stop playing. I want to put in minimal effort and not grind AV 24/7. I'd be super mad if honorspy breaks.
---
ElvUI does have a forum/website for this y'know.
---

---
&gt; \- Reagent count on ActionBars displays 0. This is a Blizzard bug. We can't fix it.
---
I dont see how on any planet this doesn't make you an asshole.
---
Hey guys heres how to break a popular addon!
---
You do realize that each server is connected to the region right? Also depends on when you play....
---
Improved cs is always nice and it doesn't have to hit a spell to silence
---
For those who were confused by rank 1 corruption:
---
Make the priest burn mana on dispells
---
lolwut?
---
I can't speak from first hand experience as an officer who controls the DKP, only as a regular guild member bidding and gaining DKP.  From my perspective, it has been very easy to utilize. Bidding and looking up your DKP is super easy. 
---
It sounds like our lootmasters generally really like using it, but there are times where they have to put in extra effort to coordinate DKP between multiple raid groups or have to fix discrepancies in DKP that don't seem to have updated correctly. Sorry I can't give you more info, but maybe someone else will chime in.
---
It does, but he's saying they "spams his food" meaning after every tick they sit and eat another food.
---
Yeah because taking jabs at someone's english in a subreddit about mmorpgs is the real man here... good riddance
---
No, they aren't doing it. They don't avoid their win.
---
Click food, heal the first tick, get knocked out of eating, repeat. Hence the spam
---
psure we are all in the same battlegroup
---
But when they get less rep and have to queue for longer it’s a terrible deal for horde to roll over and lose. There’s also an argument to be made that it’s not fun to just run up and never even kill a boss. Why would horde want 7 minute games that give them minimal rep?
---
Chad instant queues for Alliance. Horde deserve every bit of difficulty they can get after P2 release.
---
For PvE your bread and butter dps set-up will be fury with axes.  As others said you'll want a frostbite+flurry axe to start with, ideally.  Once you have that set-up you'll be aiming for a Deathbringer from Onyxia, and perhaps a second Deathbringer if the way your loot system in your guild allows for it/your guild gets a lot to drop etc. (in the future, a Crul axe when BWL comes out).  The downside to Flurry axe is you can't use an elemental sharpening stone on it due to its weapon level (and you won't be able to use one on your main hand due to windfury totem).  The weapon proc seems to make up for that VS what's currently available though.
---
Coming from Wotlk/tbc I never understood how unbalanced pvp in vanilla was.
---
Rogues who can kill me in stunlock.
---
Mages who can polymorph for 1 fucking minute.
---
Fear that don't break on damage.
---
I'm having really fun in classic but the pvp is a joke tbh and I realized why everyone rolled mage/rogue now.
---
Blaming honorspy is the definition of killing the messenger, and yep, this is a nice way to be a huge dick to your entire faction.
---
Dang that sucks. Glad you broke it off, you're better off now anyways!
---
Fearing the pet seems unnecessary when you can just curse of weakness it(or amplified curse).
---
Leave some people to defend. Do note if the horde doesn't do backdoor, it puts you to a disadvantage.
---
Lol alliance has to jump over a fence, horde has to climb wall which can be easily missed, I propably took the bait but git gud
---
HonorSpy is not the same as Spy
---
Man thats so fucking tilting. Ive got no idea why or how but 75% of the time tremor doesnt remove lock fear. Any idea why???
---
Everyone just wanna run arena runs :(
---
Personally it sounds like you should stick with swords if you are doing pve content. You are already sitting with swords and combat sword spec is one of the best dps specs and will be throughout classic. Dagger spec wont shine till later on. What you run now is a great pvp spec though so if you are doing heavy pvp and still want to raid with the guild honestly it should be fine.
---
I mean, i guess that works if you want to pay your repair costs in food and have a stack of something cheap but still effective enough.
---
Whats gonna be funny is the people with rank 14 weapons will have earned very few honor kills as they'll just be farming drek
---
I rolled dwarf rogue for stone form, and it saved my ass against other rogues and warriors. Shame hes now stuck on flamelash. Guess I'll re roll
---
I’m helping by killing solos in mid. Right?
---
have never gained less than 2k honor in an AV as alliance either win or loss.
---
No it's not. Your goal as a Tank is to generate Threat, so TPS is what you should be looking at. DPS and TPS are two entirely different things, and idiot tanks who are padding parses are hurting their TPS to benefit their DPS parses.
---
What a surprise people bitching in the comments
---
Wasnt it when nef came out?
---
Alliance queues are still avg 2 seconds.
---
Just tell him honestly. There's no point in starting some larger scheme to make him shut up, the fastest and easiest way is to be straight with him and let him know that it's annoying and doesn't help anything.
---
what part of the first function do you replace with the character name? is it just the  broadcast(self:Serialize(player.name, player))  line ?
---
First of all, booh you for fishing in AV. Secondly, iirc you need 305 for guaranteed catch
---
Its still just not good. The 2piece is worthless, and the 4piece proc or 6piece ap don't do enough to justify putting it on over other, better gear.

If you are EVER equipping Soulforge, it means that you're not competent enough to even run BWL, which is easily pugable by the time t0.5 comes out. Soulforge is stopgap gear and the worst set that a pvp or offensive paladin could equip. For stopgap gear, the grind is unreasonably long, demanding you farm out the full set, as well as invest an insane amount of gold into it. 
---
Just farm PvP and get your weekly Judgement gear lockouts, you'll be strictly better off than if you bothered farming Soulforge.
---
At least in League you can get to Diamond 4 and it's actually legit.
---
This is like jerking off that you beat a diamond 4 player in 1 game.
---
It ticks about every five or so seconds, so if you time it wrong you can eat a fear in between ticks. Good locks will make sure its destroyed as well.
---
What are you on about? How much honor they have has no influence of their decay. Not this week, not next week.
---
Gotcha, ty
---
After the initial response and one more reply, I think I got this! *thumbsup*
---
Hpal is godly at everything bar dpsing 
---
But apparently if it isn’t making you do leet dps it must be bad.
---
No wonder alliance cries about pvp so much, half of them don’t get Paladin.
---
All of these can be edited:
---
&gt;     player.name = "HonorSpyRIP";
---
&gt;     player.class = "PRIEST";
---
&gt;     player.standing = 12;
---
&gt;     player.thisWeekHonor = 1963478;
---
&gt;     player.lastWeekHonor = 1974856;
---
&gt;     player.RP = 61342
---
&gt;     player.rank = 14
---
Leave the line with broadcast as player is the object you need to change above.
---
1. Everyone is farming honor in AV/WSG now that BG's are out. It is totally realistic to only move up one rank.
---
2. Delete HonorSpy. It is causing massive chat lag and other issues with many users.
---
You broke the first rule!
---
Why don’t you take you own advice lol... shut up and quit bitching about people bitching about a 15 year old game and it’s pvp modes
---
So you have proven yourself wrong right in your own post, ok.
---
Mark it vent/gripe then since it's not a discussion but your thinly veiled whine.
---
We use it, it’s very efficient
---
Once BGs hit, I remembered why I enjoy WoW so much. I’m Alliance now, and I was Horde in vanilla. Both were and are awesome in BGs.
---
enjoy your queues zug :)
---
Only the top 0.1% can clear MC
---
Doesn’t even bother me son! This is classic!!!
---
ubrs is a pain with how many slow bosses it has. you fall asleep doing the egg room boss then you fall asleep doing rend. Its just a painful dungeon even if you skip stuff.
---
Bye bye good food.
---
yea cept horde is winning 60-70% of them now
---
Reeeeeeeeee
---
I like taking breaks too but with queues/gamelength as they are I literally spend more time taking breaks than playing
---
Reading between the lines, it seems that you're upset that you and your premade won't be able to control the system the way you intended. Which is great. The mafia-style control over the upper brackets that you're advocating for is cancerous. 
---
*My friends and i should be able to get higher faster for abitrary reasons. WE deserve dat r14 first.* QQ more
---
That's unironically completely fine. Alliance is so bad they manage to lose even when joining as premade vs Horde pugs on a constant basis now.
---
Sure, horde does get more honor but it's all relative. It doesn't matter how much more honor horde gets than alliance. It only matters that alliance are averaging around the same amount every game.
---
Honor meaningless other than ranking. And ranking is only relative to your faction.
---
Lol no. An undergeared warlock with no engineering maybe. If we're talking about a good warlock who actually cares about PvP then a hunter will get pumped and it's only going to get worse because warlocks scale insanely well with gear on phase 3 and beyond
---
 \*quietly reports for afk\*
---
I rarely let the SWP even stick. Felhunter eats SWP, I cast curse of elements then Immolation + Rank 1 Corruption to bait out dispels while I spam searing pain until death.
---
Hello, Undead Warlock here. I use Soul Link and Frost mages are still one of the harder matchups. Engineering makes it a bit easier with ice reflector. Buy a Spider Belt to break a frost nova and prevent that nasty Crit increase. Major Spellstone is a MUST, it breaks another frost nova. When they ice block start bandaging, you either get the full duration heal or it forces them to drop their block early. Use felhunter, obviously, and save spell devour for when they throw up an ice barrier, you might get lucky and eat it.
---
Even doing all this and eating a healthstone I will still loose to a skilled frost mage. It’s just a difficult matchup. Best thing you can do is just throw yourself at them and get that practice. Even if you get wrecked, you still learn something.
---
Important to note, it's compared to the last two weeks of recorded kills, not all time.
---
Well if you won't click the links, at least download an AV / anti-malware...
---
Your comment was about the fact that av should award less honour because it greater caters for pug players, I’m saying that this is nonsense because A) nothing is really stopping you from forming an AV raid and B) this was just how vanilla was, it’s the players that changed not the game.
---
Good warlock with fellhunter beats good shadow priest
---
The felhunter can eat the fear.
---
Counterspell
---
Just roll on Skeram bro :)
---
Yes! Sorry I was at work, basically what people said here is what parsing means. 
---
It’s the comparison on how well your playing your class in terms of DPS. (You can also check threat time, spell rotation, consumables, healing parses, buffs, debuffs) the website warcraft logs basically lets you analyze the raid as a whole! 
---
It’s super awesome
---
you don't have to use best in slot. Just use gear you get from raids/dungeons
---
I thought I was just bad.  Glad to know I’m not alone.
---
some SL locks never lose but tbh most that I've fought 1v1 I've won against 
---
I actually have the most problem with void sac locks, if they don't have a void out I have no hesitation opening on them 
---
but a good SL lock is a really rough fight
---
Only bad rogues Wotf or trinket the first fear. And most of us carry around resto pots.
---
gap only increases the higher the percentile though, but they're still lower. Also considering that if you dont have shadowweaving they'll do less compared to higher parses
---
I don't claim to be a paladin expert but I'm fairly sure that using four of the epic pieces of soulforge is superior to judgement for pvp shockadins assuming that the 4 piece proc up time is good.
---
Ah yeah, since battlegrounds came out I haven’t died a SINGLE TIME! I’m glad you’re doing well in Earthfury!!
---
You make a raid group and do a /pull 10 for a DBM countdown. Everyone needs DBM or BigWigs. As soon as the pull timer hits 0.0 you all que and post in raid chat what BG number you got. If it’s all the same or almost all the same you zone in. Those that didn’t get it que for that specific BG number (new games are at the bottom of the list). If too many ppl get different battlegrounds just all leave que and try again.
---

---
Yes same here. This game is 10x more fun than grinding on an Ironman.
---
You don’t understand how any of this works. If your fury/prot in defensive stance your best dps rotation is your top TPS. According to logs the tops dps tanks are the highest tps tanks that’s not just a coincidence.
---
Again how are you wiping?
---
Thank you @morph1ing! There’s still much to improve but I’m having so much fun learning about my class and how I can keep improving. It makes me look forward to playing classic. 
---
Warriors are so dynamic. I love it.
---
&gt;  Sounds like you don’t want anyone who overly reported AFKs to get caught, are you one of those assholes?
---
Weak argument since you know nothing about me. I'm not worried about the people who deserve punishment, I'm worried about false positives. People who 'look' like abusers but aren't. Blizzard uses automatic systems, and made mistakes even before they delegated punishment to algorithms. Bans should be saved for significant things, not handed out every time someone does something shitty.
---
I've never even considered perception weak - it's only useful against two classes but is oppressive to them. I can almost always charge targets spotted by it, and if I get into a choke like the BRM mountain gates, equip catseye and face the door, nothing gets by. Any flashes of stealth sound and I pop percep, with catseye I can even spot them *outside* charge range.
---
No, but battlegrounds doesn't give experience, so you can just stay at 19 and do WSG all day
---
AI being used to mean "code that does something which would normally require human intelligence" was pretty ubiquitous among game developers for a very long time.
---
You get diminishing returns by killing the same player over and over again. It doesn't show on the honor gained pop up in chat so they probably dont realise.
---
I think I’ve had my eating interrupted by sitting too close to a fire though
---
I'd say the more powerful bonus is 2% crit on healing. You can get as high as 20% with the right talents and items - it's no joke. 
---
The really stupid chase for "+healing over all else" is dumb but it appears that the OP is more accepting when you say it than me.
---
Offensive Paladins would prefer to have better baseline stats than a proc for more stats. We don't have enough offensive abilities to take advantage of on proc burst windows. 95 SP isn't enough to justify holding onto Holy Shock for,  and if we held Judge for the window, we could get 2 Judgements and some autos off in the window. It's just not better than a better statline on gear. If you got the proc, you'd pretty much just use it to heal.
---
Judgement almost doubles the baseline spellpower of most Soulforge pieces. IIRC Soulforge is dropping with the AQ patch and has an insanely demanding grind, and by that point in time, BWL is easily pugable, Ony is trivial, and MC can be cleared in sub 1 hour with ease. When Soulforge comes out, Avengers is obtainable as well, which is permabis for the rest of the game.
---
Edited my last post to include links to the 4 accessible sets in question. I dont think many people will be running around in Marshals, so I didn't include it.
---
Soulforge offers more Melee crit, so you could argue it's better for deep ret, control ret, or reckoning ret, but if we're talking 31 holy/x prot/x ret the better baseline stat block from Judgement is generally going to be better. I personally don't think Paladin is strong enough as a melee class to justify losing the healing power from the lower spellpower for some extra physical stats. I prefer having that hybrid power. Spellpower works on both healing and damaging abilities, so I'd rather double dip than invest in Paladin's weakest aspect (melee).
---
Yes you're gonna get IP banned
---
... as a priest.
---
12 full raids in and only 1 arcanist binding, 0 ingots, and 0 bre’s. Probably 20 Druid drops.
---
Horde I’ve heard is about 5-10 minutes. Alliance is still instant.
---
That’s rude
---
This seems like a super slow run for virtually no profit. Maybe if you get every herb downstairs it's fine, but wow this seems super slow.
---
There are discord’s of hundreds of alliance rankers across all servers where we have over 100+ in a single channel, someone countdowns, and you move to a channel based on what av you got in. So it looks like pugs (were all from different servers) but we actually have 25+ of the 40 players in discord working together. It looks like a pug but we’re premades
---
Doesn't matter, no one is obligated to min/max, and it's not griefing. There's plenty of ways to play AV, it's supposed to be a whole ass battle. Get over it or don't play it.
---
Yeah it’s the same with my portals, says 0 even when I have reagants
---
DOT ticks interrupt bandaging, not eating
---
... did someone say
---
Nope.
---
But battlegrounds don't give exp, and you don't gain any while dead for the purpose of farming dungeons, timbermaw rep or whatever else
---
Chances are fury prot isn't necessary for your guild in any way and you're just taking more damage for no reason. 
---
As deep prot, i out threat and take less damage than most other tanks on my server.
---
Also DPS is just not helping your raid all that much. Being top 10 dps is not something you should be proud of, there's literally no point in being that high up on the dps charts. If you want to do damage, play DPS not tank.
---
Makes you stand up no?
---
Why are people grouping for BGs try hards? So if I want to pvp with my guild we're all try hards? Your logic sucks.
---
Don’t run from a warlock, you’ll just die tired.
---
Yeah I was on almost most of the morning and afternoon Thursday and Friday and it was averaging about 8 minutes.
---
How? I just get stunlocked and die
---
locks are a meme, im an eng on my sp and a lock cant get me to below 50% w/o me starting low mana. shadow reflect trinket, silence, blackout stun, aoe fear, dispel and then heals on top of it. also im dispelling all of your beneficial buffs when i fight a lock too. maybe you fight bad sp's if u ever get a win.
---
Yeah but it’s more fun. I do switch to shield when necessary. And it’s good practice for BWL because from what I understand is that threat is a big issue there.
---
You can be a different spec in 2 minutes. A weapon upgrade is an upgrade. If you don’t care what spec you play you shouldn’t be locked into one arbitrarily. 
---
Your point about this is classic? Boss loot tables are huge, not much gear drops. Get the gear you can. You shouldn’t be locked into a spec till you have a piece of raid gear that’s only applicable to that spec.
---
This is the kind of player we're dealing with on this subreddit.
---
Not the dude you're talking to, but our guild has wiped on geddon because the tank prioritized tps over fr, too heavily, and stayed in. I remember solely because he was blaming the healers despite him going into it with only BP1 FR.
---
If dumbass wanted the mageblade, they should have saved for a mageblade - Holy Pally with a Mageblade.
---
Corruption
---
Pally t0 is actually the best PvP set until r10 gear, so that set has some merit(6 piece anyways, boots and gloves aren’t the best).
---
You can do /reload and it should work
---
What's wrong with them?
---
I rolled mage because I want to tank and I remember how expensive leveling up a warrior was, so now I have a nest egg if I want to do it again.
---
&gt;Yikes.
---
Good server. Not great because of the name police morons that pollute every rppvp server.
---
You ever group with an ele shaman? The threat is unmatchable on single targets. Earth shock deals double the amount of threat in damage on a 5-6 second cooldown. I crit for 1500 earth shocks, along with a spammable 2/1.5 second 1600 crit damage lb/cl. Rockbiter produces the same amount of threat as a heroic strike every swing. I recently read that rockbiter modifies spells as well but I cant confirm this. Someone on reddit said it. Probably not true but I've noticed I seem to aggro more with rockbiter while casting.
---
Now I'm not saying shaman tanks can do this, shaman tanking is quite bad imho. I only tried it a few times as a low level until SM, but I'm quite certain ele shaman produce the most threat out of any class in the game when geared and specced properly. I'm not saying ele shaman are tanks, or even that being able to produce that much threat as a class that isnt optimized as a decent tank is a good thing. It's not. It sucks having to hold back so much in dungeons sometimes. But I do believe we are the biggest threat producers in the game simply because of blizzards weird decision to give us crazy high threat scaling on a skill with a 5/6 second cooldown. 
---
It would he a fun experiment to have a bunch of really high threat dealing classes and see who can grab threat the best From a mob. There is no direct source citing "shamans deal highest threat" because it's really not helpful to us. We usually want the opposite. But I dont think any class has as much threat production as ES. Feel free to try and prove me wrong. I've been playing a shaman for a long time and I've never seen anyone pull aggro from the tanks as quick as an ele in the instances where we go balls to the wall burst.
---
&gt;and you don't gain any while dead for the purpose of farming dungeons, timbermaw rep or whatever else
---
What? :)
---
Definitely. People say classic talents are cookie cutter but there’s actually a ton of variance you can have. A few points in different spots here and there can make the build very different.
---
Instant don't think I've ever waited more than a few seconds.

---
Are you geared?
---
That's what I figured, thanks
---
Hence he said geared. Not just t1 but later on, very geared Shamans and Paladins just aren't worth engaging as a physical damage class.
---
So... no support?
---
My point about this being classic is that loot is handled differently and no raid leader will give a warrior a dagger over a rogue just because it’s a big upgrade for the warrior. 
---
If you don’t care what spec you play then you don’t care about what weapon you want. You can’t just go into molten core and expect to roll on all weapons just because it’s an upgrade for you. 
---
You came into the raid locked into a spec. So you will get loot based off that spec. Want a dps warrior rolling on tank gear because he can go tank spec in under 2 minutes? Or do you want your dps warrior rolling on dps warrior thing?
---
“Get the gear you can” is a shit attitude. This is why the game is dying. Because of people who only care about loot and nothing else.
---
Paladin is face roll, easily our easiest match-up. Idk what warlocks you’re beating but it should never be close. Devour Magic removes the stun and you have no other way to close the gap. 
---
WoW isn’t balanced around 1v1 PvP so it’s not a knock against paladins, I’d argue a well played paladin is more impactful in group PvP than a well played warlock. But (I’m Ally, not Horde) I don’t think I’ve ever lost a duel against a paladin
---
i know this might be a stupid question , and i might get biased answers , but is it really worth it to play this game. For context i have never played wow ever. I like the idea of the game. I like the long grinding. I just never got around to it. is it too late to start playing now? i know the revamped classic has been out for 3 months or so. thanks for anyone that bothers to answer
---
A lure doesnt increase the chance to catch a specific fish, it just increases your skill relative to where you're fishing. So if you have 300 fishing and the pool requires 225 to fish in, it would likely require like 275 to guarantee not letting a catch get away, then you dont need a lure.
---
Take azshara bay of storms. Requires like 350 I think to cast in the water, and 425 to guarantee not missing a catch. No difference on what fish is caught.
---
So in your case you likely dont need a lure. If yla fish gets away, throw a cheap lure on.
---
In a raid setting? No, it's incredibly boring.  In dungeons/open world? The heal over time playstyle is kinda fun and you get some massive heals with healing touch so I enjoy it

Eh I’m a serious ally pve player and I’ve just started the grind due to being busy at work this month
---
Doesn’t matter if they’re undead or not, they either kill you in their opening combo or you survive, coil, then chain into fear, which they trinket, sprint, kill you. 
---
Of course that’s a 1v1 and in group PvP you’re far more likely to get a shield from your healer and your team to delete the rogue. But lock-rogue 1v1 is awful against a competent rogue with equal gear. 
---
If you have Void out when you get jumped it’s a different story, and if you have Void AND you’re SL you basically can’t lose to a rogue. But I’d rather have the Felpup out which makes pretty much every other match-up easier and just accept that I can’t deal with rogues one on one

CLICK PORTAL FOR MAGE TABLE!!!
---
Why is someone considered a bad rogue for trinketing the first fear? Honest Question.
---
This seems like a lot of work to break an addon that doesn't affect you in any way. Breaking this addon is not going to change how people are grinding honor either.
---
Honorspy also wasn't the only addon that was causing chat channel issues.
---
Honor and RP aren't the same.
---
Warlocks are easy as any melee. Just line of sight. Idk what idiots you're playing that just let's you cast and cant close the gap. Put on my SR set and you cant even dot me.
---
you're talking about duels in an open field, with no LoS and no resistance. Typical CDL duelist. Probably thinks using a pot is cheating, while you grenade and bandage each time
---
Wtf a guild is determining what professions its members can have? Time to find a new guild.
---
Normally mage food.
---
How you know that man?
---
Honest question for a noob - how does VW help in pvp?
---
If your grinding for Don Julios anyway wouldn’t it make sense to save 300g on mount? Time spent isn’t huge for exalted most people that hit it hard are already done I’m on day 3 of grind with regular job and haven’t been no lifeing and should be exalted today or tomorrow on a few hours of play time a day sense drop. Will come out with bis ring a dagger and a mount that saves me 300g worth the grind imo
---
Uh, make sharding a little more consistent like layering. Something that was a little jarring at one point was having Orgrimmar be under attack while on my level 30, hopping to my 120 (same realm, war mode on) and there's nobody around.
---
Otherwise...I don't know? Class quests? Quicker paced PvP in which gear matters?
---
[https://wago.io/RDC5y57BB](https://wago.io/RDC5y57BB)
---
weakaura that does it.
---
That's not difficulty is it? 
---
And you can in both, with classic it will depend on gear, your lvl vs mob lvl, you can't skill your way out of a bad pull any better than you could on retail.
---
Yeah LIPs would help a lot if you survive the burst. Could live long enough after your Coil for your DoTs to kill them. But when I talk about PvP match-ups I assume people are wearing normal gear and only using class-specific abilities and consumables, e.g. Healthstone or Spellstone. If you start taking every possible trinket and consumable into account there are way too many variables to consider
---
O
---
Yeah not wearing cloth is the reason why he is carried. It's not like molten core is a HUUUUGE fucking joke of a raid that can be done in greens. My super casual guild clears it in 2 hours at most. Maybe he just doesn't like the way cloth looks on him, like are seriously implying that ~100 healing power on a DRUID is gonn a be the difference between a wipe and a kill? What is this? mythic Molten Core?
---
What does this even mean? People throw it around, same as "rpg elements" without every really expanding. Do you mean, like, Mages should be the aoe class? Warriors are the only tanks?
---
Because that type of "identity" sucks.
---
Lmao ok. Sorry I went by the standard definition of a "progression guild" rather than thinking every raiding guild is a progression guild. 
---
I guess I should have been more understanding since I'm in a hardcore PvP guild that doesn't do BGs or world PvP.
---
This was a problem when bgs first came out in vanilla. Tons of people were having fun and grinding hard, and it took most a couple weeks to realise they were bottle necking from the honor inflation. 
---
What is going to happen is players who coordinate honor gains will have a nice progression path, and everyone who doesnt play nice will find themselves having to play even more, or risk unsafe practices like account sharing or botting. 
---
People are nuts if they think this weeks honor gains are sustainable to r14.
---
This. Ticking warlock dots dont keep you in combat.
---
That's becoming annoying
---
Gratz man, i have been trying since day 1 for my full t0 set, but morherfucket drak never drops the devout vest
---
Nope. Classic+ baby
---
We use engineering to clear the raids. Our best MC time is 38mins, so everyone needs sapper charges. Also used by the bodyguard raid to defend from Alliance trying to kill our main raid (which they deliberately do, took us 30mins to safely get everyone into the raid for our speed run attempt!).
---
It's mostly in preparation for BWL tbh.
---
me and my friends call those mounta harmstring mounts. :)
---
You're 100% correct, technically. But for some reason people wanted to be pissed at you, so the 2-3 people decided to downvote and the rest just followed brainlessly. Reddit just works that way. It's all good man, we all had these moments before.
---
It's not even remotely the same for horde. My guild tried queuing 20 people with a countdown multiple times, got a couple in the same AV out of 20. The horde have a much longer queue and get shuffled into multiple Bags trying it.
---
I hate how people feel like they're "pressured" into playing this way. 
---
Do you look up a walkthrough and guide for every single player game too to feel like you're playing it optimally? Just enjoy it for what it is.
---
So optimal game theory is to get on reddit while you are in AV and propose this idea while never actually planning on getting on an alt, correct?
---
Of course it's not too late! I just hopped in last month and am already at lvl 48. I'd say start on a medium pop server. It can feel a little overwhelming seeing tons of people in full raid gear on high pop servers whereas on medium servers it's actually like seeing a legend.  Just don't get too carried away making alts like I did lol
---
Fuck that’s smart. Good call!
---
Yeah I had all my BiS list written out when I was playing, most optimal ways of making money and the likes too. 
---
This isn't a generational gap problem, just different people enjoying the game differently.
---
In just 4 days av become unbearable shithole full of filthy keyboard turners. Blizz should rly do fuckin battlegroups and put active pvp servers and separate pve/language realms on another battlegroup. Ok, boomer, i get it, you did 3 hours av when u were young virgin and  stuff. Put them in separate battlegroups so they can have their 24/7 bgs all the time.
---
This is my biggest complaint. I expected small battle groups, and really wanted server only BGs at first.... Not even close to what we got. I'm playing horde on a pretty balanced server and think the people playing on what have basically ended up on PvE servers due to their behavior should eat the shit sandwhich they made themselves.
---
Lol k. Nice downvote too lmao. Don’t even know what CDL is but cool dude, good job
---
Weird that it was supposedly the issue, but never caused issues on US. Almost like it wasn't.
---
Thanks for showing people how to break an addon that adds a function blizz should have added. I'm SO glad you're saving us from a very useful addon. Dick.
---
In a raid group, you're not.
---
No, but BGs don't give exp
---
INCREDIBLY. No, it's not. Even fully geared raids barely crack 550/600 and it's generally just in the execute phase. 500+ won't be average until well into BWL. You're talking out of your ass. If everyone did 550+ you could 20 man MC.
---
They are also not killing you in 2.5 seconds, until late BWL gear and on

I don't know about changing bar 2, but you could macro the things on bar 2 to a similar effect
---
That is where it is supposed to be located officially. Though it is not represented in the game world at all.
---
I am exalted, as is the majority of people I played wPvP with and none of us have made the jump, since AV is giving out so much honor right now.  Every moment spent in WSG gets us further behind someone AFK in AV.  The best hope for a correction is AV queue times become so bad and WSG times are ok and it causes a shift.
---
How can you be smug about winning through sheer numbers? lol, literal cockroach mentality.
---
GG EZ
---
ahh decay only affects rank points, see i didn't know. Cheers dude.
---
Gotta start reporting them once the match starts.  If they stay in the tunnel or run to some other "hidey" spot, they get a free afk report.
---
No regrets, Yeah we get to pick most our fights and have very low bis cost/time sink at 60. I made out pretty easy compaired to say a warriors need to save a bajillion arcanite bars xD
---
I dont think it has a lot to do with Horde meta. Usually when alliance loses its due to poor leadership and too many strategies. Ive also noticed my win rate as alliance varied by the time of day. Weekday evenings seemed to have a lot of turtle games and I probably lost 50-60% as alliance. Early AM and afternoon I was back to winning 80% of games in less than 15 minutes.
---
its ok bro someone already explained my mistake cheers tho
---
It's actually very easy to break.
---
Wow I'm such a fool and totally forgot about sacrifice! My VW stopped holding aggro around level 30 so I haven't even used him since. Thanks for reminding me.
---
OUCH! GOT ME!
---
I wish I had that bonus, crit is fantastic especially on down ranked heals that could do with being a little bigger. I have a few other priests in my raid that go for +healing as their main squeeze and their overhealing is astronomical. To each their own, chasing stats is fun and addictive so I get it. I just find that a good blend of things works better for my style. My rule of thumb is if my renew ticks for 315+ unbuffed were good on +healing.
---
Wow. 6x stacks of mage food w/ extra salt please
---
It's an item, so it's not on the same GCD as spells.
---
No but it is true that if they grind 3 mil in a week it just means that they just set the bar really high for everyone, including themselves down the line. If people wouldn't no life 18 hours a day ranking wouldn't be so hard, problem is there's always gonna be someone willing to do just that.
---
Can't find the classic version. Can you post a link?
---
I'm fully aware, and it costs a lot of money too.  That actually makes it better in my eyes because almost nobody will do it.
---
I ussually offer a mage MOTW for a stack of water
---
Healer: water plz
---
5 trade open with one stack each. 
---
Yeah this thread is dumb af
---
Lol okay boomer... you realize that the majority of the original classic community are millennials and Gen X... maybe learn what a boomer is before throwing the word around
---
This. It's so annoying as an alli lock playing hard mode, while getting all the bs complaints that horde warlocks rightly get. We can only safely fear a hunter, and even then you usually fear the pet.
---
If I had a CC aside from a 3s death coil then it would be a different story.
---
I get that some people are rude, but demanding gold for a couple of clicks is, idk, irrational imo.
---
When I play on my mage I happily give food and water to anyone, I do not expect anything in return.
---
Should I drop tailoring/skinning for herb/alch? I'm 300/300 and I don't actually use skinning at all. I have robe of the archmage now so do I even need to keep tailoring if I can get more useful professions and pick up mooncloth bags later?
---
This is also sort of an issue with AV being the main honor grind.  There are objectives in AV that matter to some and not others and you shouldn't be at risk of being reported if you cap a mine and people don't like that, which is also an issue that's been reported.
---
&gt;Yeah not wearing cloth is the reason why he is carried.
---
I mean, yes. He's going out of his way to NOT wear optimal gear. 100 healing power, more like 200 or more that he's missing by not wearing cloth.
---
Just because "it's easy" doesn't mean it's okay to purposefully slack. The only reason he's successful is because the rest of the raid isn't slacking.
---
&gt;the difference between a wipe and a kill?
---
That's not what I said. Stop strawmanning me.
---
Maybe worry more about yourself you sad, angry little Gamer
---
How is it rude. i had as much right to roll as he did
---
You'll probably see a sharp decline in people with 250-350k honor next week, a lot of people are getting exalted then quitting av.
---
Saw a Dwarf priest called Kingjongheals
---
Onemanzoo  was the best I've seen
---
Rogue Mage.  CC overload, I choose who can no longer play the game.
---
Wow
---
You’re right people should come prepared. But wow. Maybe I should tell people that before I can heal them, I need gold so I can buy mana from the mage.
---
If you die in a dungeon that you need loot for, you get no XP while a 60 clears it and you can roll on loot
---
Stop projecting. Not everyone is as miserable as you
---
Blaumeux Horde checking in. See you around.
---
Yep, I have won 80% of my games today simply because we do the mages tp back/mass aoe/wipe them meta thingie. Allies haven't countered it yet. We take 5m more but completely wipe them.
---
lmao they have 7 new games coming out you fucking quilt, some competing directly with blizzard.  
---
legends of runeterra will compete directly with hearthstone.
---
there's a tactical multiplayer FPS that will compete directly with overwatch.
---
action RPG that will compete with diablo.
---
Wow... this whole time ive been tipping 4g for 4 stacks of water and 2 of food. Meh.
---
No, we def changed our meta. Before it was 100%, no one behind, rush and accept defeat. Now, we have active delay/wipe teams, and we coordinate "south" and "north". The hivemind tactics have very much shifted. Matches are now more delayed but we win them far more often.
---
stfu and pre conjure one stack of water per person you lazy pig. 
---
But sure outside of bg i'll be the most polite guy when asking for water but it baffles me that a mage can Q a bg without having his bag filled with water.
---
Haha yeah fuckin losers spending time with their family and loved ones lmaoooo XDD
---
you are a multiboxer and call HIM a neet? haha good one
---
Or maybe we should all stop saying it because it's fucking annoying
---
That set looks REALLY nice on the female dwarf model. Congrats!!
---
Why are you so poor that you can't afford 6 stacks of water for 1 gold? You should make at least that much in a dungeon run, or farming, in that many stacks of water. Probably quite a lot more than that.
---
Boomers aren't literally baby boomers though in this context
---
Is everyone having issues with add-ons and AV?  
---
Tried updating the ones that wow keeps asking to disable but then next game I have to disable them again.  
---
I don't need them but I like having them.
---
That level 40 helm is a dps piece, not good for a dedicated tank
---
It's morphed to insult anyone who is behaving in a way akin to gatekeeping, holier than though baby boomers, you boomer
---
Yeah laymen love to think they know anything about the subject because they did a few google searches on AI. I’m fine with the downvotes which is why I won’t delete my comments because I know I’m not wrong.
---
How bad of an idea is it to level as Boomkin? I’ve done Feral before and while I like it quite a bit, I though it would be fun to change it up this time around.
---
If you could spread your hands like the statue you would look like goblin jesus
---
Truth was spoken on this day.
---
I don't like this kind of animation/meme style
---
No prob. General rule is that felhunter is your choice against casters, voidwalker is your choice against warrior/rogue/hunter. Succubus is good with Conflag builds but I wouldn’t worry about that for a while. I roll with felhunter in group PvP as SM/Ruin regardless because of its insane utility and high spell resist
---
Yes. You pull patch and all the commanders into galv's room, get a rogue to kidney him and vanish&gt;CS so he doesnt fear, pvp trinks up for the same reason. Run out, gather the commanders on the road, get a hunter to pull commander from the tower in the meantime, AOE them down proceed to drek. 2-3 people kill the commander in front of the base gates, get relief hut commander and GY &gt; drek. 10 min max for 3 k honor and 3 marks (400)
---
That's genius. Thanks for that.
---
I had a guild like this on a... undocumented server shortly before Classic came out. It was a clique of friends, red flag.
---
Raided with them every week for a month, never got a single piece of loot. The way they did it was by your DPS meter. Yeah, a red flag. The irony was I was usually in the middle to upper, despite being the least geared, yet I never got loot and they eventually stopped inviting me because I eventually started being lower on the meters.
---
It's like, if u don't give loot to anyone but top performers, they're gonna stay top performers. Which is ironic because we had a Warrior who was always bottom of the meters.
---
OP, u need to gtfo of that guild. Ur wasting ur time if you've been raiding with them for 8 weeks and haven't gotten a single piece of loot.
---
You're not alone
---
I strongly disagree. If you wanna be that grumpy guy that refuses to give others some water, sure. Go ahead. Don't give them water then. There are plenty helpful people that are willing to do it. I usually politely ask a mage in a city for some food and tip something small like 20s (since it's literally just one click of work for them without any costs). Never had a mage demanding  1g for it. That would be like I, as a rogue, would demand 1g for lockpicking since it's the equivalent workload. I never demand a fee for that. Some people tip a bit, which is always appreciated, and some people don't, which is also fine since it's not a lot of work for me to click one button.
---
&gt;I get that some people are rude, but demanding gold for a couple of clicks is, idk, irrational imo.
---
I explained exactly why it is rational.
---
1. Mages have a monopoly on cheap food and water
---
2. It takes time to conjure either food or water
---
3. Time is money
---
If you want to offer your services for free to others, that is your prerogative, but the current standard on my server is 1g for 6 stacks of water or food, which, as I said above, is 1000% less expensive than the equivalent you can get anywhere else in the game.
---
It is basically the bare minimum you can ask for as a mage. As you can see in responses below, some people were paying 4g for 6 stacks of food/water and that is STILL 300% cheaper than anywhere else in the game.
---
If you told someone that they could buy a Playstation 5 for $1000, $400, or $100, based on where they got their PS5, what do you think they would do? Complain to a random stranger that they won't borrow him their PS5 for the next few hours for free?
---
Edit: Also, for people with say, a profession that has a transmute, do you think they should offer their transmutes for free? It's only a couple of clicks to transmute something, it's clearly irrational to offer it for 5 or 10g (whatever the rate is on your server). Wouldn't you agree? &lt;-- Applying your logic to a similar situation.
---
Being a gatekeeper doesn’t make you a boomer that the dumbest logic. If anything millennials are the biggest gate keepers out there and I’m speaking as a millennial myself
---
People get mad sometimes if you even mention it, I can never convince them it's like 3 minutes of killing easy adds for lots of black dragon skins and potential loot. Everyone is usually so focused on best-in-slot gear that they don't let their healers get 3rd best or 2nd best loot.
---
Shadow Ward can be immediately purged.
---
Yes let the hate flow through you
---
Honor, those pesky massive 'i wanna dump this, so buy it for super cheap' discounted prices on the AH to then make more money from them.. various other things you use random people for, in game too.
---
Imagine judging people for how they spend their Christmas
---
No it isn't.
---
It's not really a choice.
---
If you do WSG with the optimal 10 man, you are getting no better than 50% the honor that AFKers in AV are getting.  I want to be in WSG right now, but it represents never being able to get rank 14 and that is a huge part of what drives WSG pre mades.
---
Just beyond reproach
---
OK boomer
---
Mage with slow blizzard.
---
Of course, which is my point, it's the best gold/hour in the game, so naturally there is competition.
---
Its not gay if its in zimbabwe bro
---
Lol a mage crying bout money when every dungeon is a gold farm and they have 4k gold just sitting cuz they have nothing left to spend it on
---
The answer is basically "no it's not", you can choose to believe me or not. Life drain is absolute garbage dps compared to Shadowbolt and an extra 15% damage isn't going to help it.
---
hard to imagine ppl so deprived of logic and fun... today redditards and twittards are just like middle age cristians.
---
Whats the 2. song tho ?
---
This is classic pinnacle
---
Enemy players can reach you, so that's not the issue.
---
The biggest question is what happens if you aggro the alliance NPC in the tower once he starts moving.  But by then that usually means there's enough alliance around, and that spot isn't very safe.
---
im not sure if you responded to the wrong person. I was just saying that WSG premades is only good for alliance because the horde queue times are waay to high compared to AV.
---
Eh, while it's not 99% of the matches being zergs anymore, there are still a lot of matches that are over within 10 minutes. Today on EU more than half of my matches were still "rush Galv + lieutenants then Drek". 
---
So that should still be better for honor than WSG, especially since the pre 60 brackets aren't as populated.
---
I'm still seeing the game flooding with players everywhere.
---
because that would take fucking ages?
---
The meme is judging people for spending Christmas with their family.
---
OK Zoomer
---
No offense my man but what did you expect when you queue up for a bg bracket where every raid geared player on every server is also queueing
---
*horn blows*
---
SLAY THEM ALL
---
Kane gets it
---
My buddy has a toon named Kimjonghealz on Deviate delight! Dwarf priest
---
its over half off for what i buy.... didnt think it was dumb at all.
---
Good for you for doing what you wanna do with your char in terms of gear and stats. But god damn are you ever ugly, LOL.
---
welcome to wow classic.
---
The meme is not making a mockery of spending Christmas with family. Your comment is making a mockery of spending Christmas on WoW. I hope you can realize this lol
---
This was my first MMO and it's been really fun. Definitely not too late to get in on it, just join a full server
---
It's way more fun. I'd rather enjoy my time and have the rep take longer, than be bored stupid and burn out spamming 7 minute races.
---
&gt; fucking quilt
---
That is a new one. 
---
&gt; new games coming 
---
&gt; will
---
&gt; will 
---
Do you guys work for Riot or something? Like idk what you think my agenda is, but idgaf about any of it. I thought LoL was it, looks like as of this moment I'm correct. I don't care what's planned. If you do, that's great. Whatever. Not what I'm asking.
---
They don't loot all these though. At least they didn't on my server. there were like 30+ bodies and only 2 of them were skinnable.
---
Judging by honor spy I'm doing just fine.  I've done a lot of AV honestly, and only seen a few 7 minute games.  I can't keep up.  Day 1 people were bitching about short games, and now they want short games.
---
Just slow horde with hunter traps and 1 or 2 mages and Alliance always so Galv before Balinda and also arrives before to Drek.
---
I'd rather afk than pay for water in a fucking bg tbh, same shit with people charging above 1g at og, i'd rather pay the npc.
---
Steel Weapon Chain prevents disarm even when it's on your offhand, according to wowhead comments.
---
thanks, i hate it
---
All mages that have tons of days logged feel you mate. I straight up refused to sell water/food weeks ago. Its just a waste of time and hella annoying. Anyone here that says "Its just 1 click" is obviously not a mage. Takes several minutes per person, easily.
---
and exalted in like 30 play hours. who cares.
---
AV when played how intended with tower caps and ice lord is fucking fun imo
---
Then you're wasting the time of 30 other people on your side, and 40 on the other. I get that you like winning, and I wish there were separate queues for people who do, but since there aren't maybe you could quit fucking it up for the other 70 people for a weekend?
---
Imagine how many stacks of water this guy could've conjured in the time it took to make this post in an attempt to justify his bad behavior.
---
yeah
---
Only boomers want slow AV - it’s the mentality not the chronology
---
I need Dreadmist shoulders but no one runs Scholomance pugs on Heartseeker and, in the rare occasion you find one, no one wants to do Jandice. I don't NEED them, but full dungeon set was one of my goals. My Priest needs Devout shoulders as well, sigh.
---
They look awesome and have great combat animations.
---
Ah, so you didn't learn anything, not only concerning raid heals, but in the statement you just made.  
---
Good to know.
---
Allegedly people are getting 3 day bans for it if you report them.  I haven't read the eula, and I'm guessing you haven't either.
---
I would go herbalism to improve the Dire Maul Lasher farm runs, and you can safely drop tailoring because the ZG gear should be BOE unless I am mistaken... but regardless engineering is the best other profession to have. So my vote would be Herb/eng. I am leveling a mage (level 59 atm) and I got eng and tailoring, already crafted the robe so I dropped it for herb which is now 300 and the I am already half way to buying my epic mount. You wont regret the change.
---
Soon exalted never to join another AV again as Alliance!
---
&gt; People changing the meaning so they can use it more just makes the whole concept pointless and stupid.
---
Uh oh, /r/gatekeeping won't like your wrongthink.
---
One of the best looking female races? Yeah, what a shame... /eyeroll
---
Nvidia game filter stopped working as the name of classics .exe was renamed so the Nvidia system doesn't recognize it as a supported game anymore. It's a Nvidia thing and you will have to wait for them to update it, assuming they know about it.
---
I use Tuk UI!  Took a minute to get used to, but now that I have it set up the way I am comfortable, it's really hard to go back!  It really helps in raid and pvp situations I find!
---
This is a form of lying. You're making the world a worse place with this thread.
---
Sorry if it's too obvious, are you making sure you're on the correct forum for your region?
---
I checked earlier this evening, and saw 26 Alliance 60s online.
---
Yeah let’s ignore the world to churn some more honor from the most non-skill based ranking system ever created
---
HT of rank that will restore 60-70% of your HP.  
---
I found that Rejuv is too slow, I cast it, shift, pull mobs - and usually it's just one tick of Rejuv remains on me when I get first damage.  
---
For example as a Bear in dungeons you better to cast Regrow before pulling. Just because it's longer duration.
---
Do I honestly see cross realm bullshit?
---
This isn't just effecting people who want to hit a high rank, it's effecting most people in the honor system.  Even if your goal is to get the pvp mount or even some of the blue armor, WSG isn't viable.
---
I ~~think~~ hope we're selling 'em
---
Not very good, but it does have a mix of strength, intellect, and stamina so it is a decent entry PVP set.
---
Everyone always says this. My guild has 5 druids and I'm the class officer. We've gone 4 straight weeks with no cenarion/stormrage pieces. Meanwhile, and I kid you not, we've had at least 4 lawbringer and wrath pieces per raid.
---
The people who are hitting those ranks who know they are at this point, lol.
---
Dude this was my first mmo experience and I'm still hooked since classics launched. Deff recommend to give it a try
---
Is it even possible to pass gold cross-realm? I doubt so.
---
So u get locked very fast? I do lasher runs probably 200+ runs and I've only looted 1 blue book that was worth 20s. This seems so not worth it, and without herb it's basically useless.
---
imagine getting offended by the internet... in 2019
---
Do... do you need a friend to talk to?
---
If your teammate doesn't have water and needs it, you're shooting yourself in the foot by not providing it.
---
Pretty sure it's because you don't care about high rank grinding.  People consider 
---
AV Mandatory and because it has pve based objectives doesn't represent why someone should be revered as a r14.  I think if WSG or AB had higher honor this would be enough for people to stop complaining.
---
Um... I said the optimal spec for the slot and not the dps.. feral dps is &gt; moonkin but moonkin &gt; feral for the 1 druid slot.
---
Moonkin can keep FF (no cd) on all targets and has better aoe dps and better healing for trash.
---
sorry the people on ur server suck, i guess
---
Battle grounds were always going to be cross realm.
---
Yeah, I dunno, I was curious, so I went and checked out the forum myself, and none of my previous replies or characters are showing up as something I can select, I wonder if the Wow forums are having issues right now or something.
---
It is however, the weekend, so getting support on this might not be entirely possible at the moment, but I will tag one of our CS reps we have here on reddit, /u/kalviery
---
&gt; Warstomp -&gt; Regrowth and warstomp -&gt; entangling roots means nothing?
---
NElfs don't have warstomp.
---
Because the Alliance are a bunch of PvE cowards.
---
Because you're on the same team. Let me guess, you vote republican?
---
ok boomer
---
Yea it's the WoW Classic General. I've always gone to 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic/classic-discussion
---
and for some reason no characters show up on my list so that I can post.
---
I'm so jealous of these guys discussing a 5 min queue. I didn't even see that on the first day.  
---
Worst was 25 mins for me yesterday.  
---
Do you think when Honor resets it will speed up for a day or two?
---
I know it's not a choice, that's why I feel sorry for them. Atleast warsong can be fun, zerging for 18+ hours a day is not fun
---
You are
---
And warriors. They need swords too.
---
Try the item recovery tool on battle.net.
---
How could you leave out the beloved buff bots? And then the advanced tinker bots (crafting). 
---
God I miss that game.
---
I kind of would prefer if it settles on what kind of game it is. But you cant really plan accordingly, either its going to be a 7 min game where you get your rep and youre out or itll be a turtlefest where 5 horde manage to cause 30 alliance to yell "squirrel" and completely forget about objectives. Right now its kind of tough to gauge how long itll take.
---
One thing BGs in WoW reminded me was just how bad PvP in WoW is. 40 second saps, stun city, damage meant for bosses with a million HP being done to players with 4k HP. Though perhaps this is skewed as Im prot spec with gear meant for raid tanking--still, standing there for 2 minutes unable to move does not equal fun in any way.
---
&gt;Fine, why do they need to heal you?
---
They don't. That's their prerogative. They can heal me if they want to heal me, but I can currently PvP fine in the AV meta without having their heals at all, and I don't mind if they heal me or not. In fact, I go into BGs explicity with the expectation that I won't be healed because it makes me a better player. If I am not expecting heals, I learn how to survive in situations that I don't have a healer.
---
My role as a mage in group PvP is to do the following things:
---
1. Control enemy healers
---
2. Peel enemies off my healers
---
3. DPS
---
4. Keep myself alive
---
Anything else is secondary to the objective at hand and I apologize if I feel those primary responsibilities are more important than stopping mid BG to trade food and water to a hunter. While making food and water might be a part of my class, it isn't what defines my class and should not be my responsibility when I am in the BG actively PvP'ing. You can disagree if you want, but every second I spend trading or making food and water is a second that I am not performing the most important functions of my class. This is more important to winning if you care about that sort of thing.
---
&gt;You also give people int or do you charge them for the reagent cost as well?
---
Yes, I would charge for the cost of reagent if some random asks me to buff him with Arcane Brilliance. If he wants that buff he can ask the mage in his group. If he doesn't have a mage in his group, he can ask a mage in his guild. If a mage in his guild hasn't got the time, he can buy an elixir that lasts 1hr that provides +25 int off the AH for some gold. It isn't my responsibility to spend the gold that I farm on my own time to help some random person who is just using me to avoid having to spend his own time farming gold.
---
If a random person asked me to port them somewhere, my standard fee is 18s for reagent cost + tip and to be honest I'd be fine getting 18s every time I ported someone (most give 1g, standard rate).
---
I noticed this too, was leveling herbalism on a char and saw lots of crocolisk corpses along the river.
---
My goal was to craft the robe of the archmage all by myself, no AH no help. Did it yesterday (11 days played, 20h at level 60). I dinged 60 like two months ago and had to take a break. Proud as fuck for my little achievement!
---
It is not an easy quest line i remember it took me few days to complete and a lot of traveling around the world plus some gold, if you raid regularly you don't really need the set :) It is intended for non raiders or people that raid less.
---
It was with addons, all this does is create extra work for devs to rewrite things in a different way.
---
Thanks for taggin them o/
---
Various people in my guild who said they will get rank 12-14 are now looking like they won't even hit rank 8 with their standing lmao
---
maybe u do, trying to ride the wave of hate :D
---
FFS, either do it and be a member of the community or don't and be ignored, your choice.
---
&gt;Lol a mage crying bout money when every dungeon is a gold farm and they have 4k gold just sitting cuz they have nothing left to spend it on
---
Assuming the reason I made this post is about the gold.
---
I have more gold (edit: most is invested in consumes I will never use) than I know what to do with, this is about entitlement culture and the principle behind the matter.
---
If it was about gold, I wouldn't make this post, I'd be selling my food and water outside the AV cave. Dude I can't even make gold from the people I am in BG with, how does telling them to pay a mage on their servers help me?
---
Thanks for letting us all know you have 4k raw gold sitting there not invested in the cheapest Black Lotus market we will see for a long time. You clearly made your gold intelligently flipping items and not being carried by your class. Weird flex, but ok.
---
Yeeeeeaaaaah I’ve been leveling a Druid recently, just hit 15. I’ve (unfortunately) noticed just how mediocre my spell-slinging abilities are, but I was holding out hope it might get better. Thanks for the info!
---
Shows you how many "losers" there are in the world. Our AV just had one of these clowns telling us to quit, we ended up winning maybe 3-minutes later. Just try to ignore these losers, the only people who they infect are other losers.
---
&gt; Fairly, actually. I recall having people I wouldn't attack in vanilla. There were folks who I would wave to as I rode past, and they would wave back.
---
You are the worst person to have in a battleground. Keep that roleplaying shit in goldshire. BGs are a grounds meant for battle. Not for you to bring hugs to the enemy factions.
---
&gt;Crossrealm kills that,
---
Right, its Blizzards fault you cant make friends with the enemy during AV. Im sure you really take notice to every 40 players.
---
Pretty much this. A 7min game is a 7 min game. Win, 500; lose 100. Now people want Galv, which automatically doubles the time of the game and allows 5 or so Horde to set up a turtle that will probably prolong the game to 20+ mins. 
---
Even honor farmers dont seem to do the math. Sure, youll get 3k honor compared to the 1.5k of just rushing drek. But if you get double the honor, but only win 1/2 or less of the time compared to the drek rush, whats the point? Youll end up averaging less than someone on your server that gets lucky with 7 min games over and over.
---
Bro its not hard to make. Yall forget that you have it easy.
---
Rogue bandage healing spec
---
Probably a little bit since some players that don't want to grind super hard will at least try to get some honor quick to stop rank decay.
---
Selling water food and ports is part of the "better" gold making methods
---
\*laughs in paladin*
---
*Buys new computer to play 15 year old game*
---
Earthfury is amazing! We need a bit more horde but we are one of the most balanced PvP servers in the game.
---
Why eng? I was thinking alch to create my own consumables for fire resist / major mana pots / elixirs.
---
Does it cost anything for the mage to make?
---
You don't hold a monopoly on stealth classes, I'll ask a druid or a rogue (whichever you aren't) for all my stealth class needs.
---
How do you change the spectrum of rolls to 420?
---
You're The Man Now, Dog!
---
Right? I hate when people misuse the term. A turtle is when a real majority of the team stays behind to defend and send token offense if any at all
---
Well it is free to make it and if you are in a group it's kinda rude to deny giving them the food/water  and not only that, but the entire group (including you) would benefit from giving water to the healer for example.
---
Turning in marks from bgs does net some exp - but i doubt its significant enough to use as a leveling tool. more like an added bonus for the time. 
---
I would go to Southern Strangle Thorn Vietnam - quite a few good quest there for early 40s. Tanaris is also a solid choice but you will run out of quests fast there and have to come back later if you go at 40. SoS isnt bad, but it seemed more of a good place to grind mobs. Also dungeon grinding is very good - try to get into sm cath runs if you need more exp. 
---
OOps forgot badlands and searing gorge
---
&gt; Do Druids have as many macros (or more) then Warriors? 
---
Yeah, and their macros are more complex.  
---
There's 30+ symbols macro to change into any form with one button, depending on the situation.  
---
Like if you are in water - seal form, if you just outside - Travel form, if you in combat - cat form. And if you press it again - return into human form.  
---
Same goes for attacking/healing - if you mouseover enemy, cast damaging spell, if it's friendly target - healing.
---
Probably at some break point
---
Hmm, thats odd. Maybe you did the ones that i am talking about? Idk. I didnt go to southern stv until i was 40 so maybe you got it done sooner.
---
Can't the same thing be said the other way around? Don't you think it's toxic to stall out the game when other people would rather just be done with the game because you find it more fun to play a 30 minute stalemate?
---
Reserve run are very badly seen on my server
---
Why would you post here and not a more direct place? Like go to the actual server in game, or go to the server discord, or go to the server reddit.
---
That's prob what happened. I'll double check.
---
How did this guy manage to get the Salty title in Classic???
---
The moment they open trade before askin, thats the moment when they will never get shit from me
---
Night elf female
---
&gt; In your case, time is winning.
---
Winning is not necessarily the desired end effect, and I cannot dictate what people choose to do in my AV games. Their actions may be actively detrimental to my goals. Therefore, no, we are not working together as a team, as we do not share the same end goal.
---
&gt; Edit in response to your edit, people usually offer their professions for free to guildies to help advance the guild, no? Same logic for teamwork in a BG.
---
BGs are cross-realm. I will likely never see those people again, ever, for the entire time I play Classic WoW. Those people cannot and will not help me achieve my goals. People in my guild generally help me and try to get to know me and want to see me succeed. It is in my best interest to help them. Some of them are even my close friends. One of them I invited to my wedding this past year.
---
You cannot apply what you would do for your guildmates to a cross-realm BG. The people in my BG may be actively hurting my goals, so there is no incentive for me to help them unless they don't mind playing 10 minute AV games where you don't care if you win or lose. They may want to win at all costs, and they may go as far as to force hours long turtle games, which hurts me and my goals. Most of the time you'd call someone who goes out of their way to hurt themselves a bit loose in the head, no?
---
After some further investigation, I've come to the conclusion that Blizzard is still just having some web server issues.
---
For example, I went to the World of Warcraft homepage, and tried to click the login button. Immediately hit an internal server error.
---
Guess we just gotta wait and hope they sort it out I guess.
---
If you really wanted to be a stickler then yeah you could, but it's just not a big deal for the most part. Gear drops all the time and benefits all classes, so it all evens out over time. It also adds some fun to the game to pick up weapon upgrades as you play rather than from the AH
---
This is in contrast to dungeons that have one specific valuable mat. If you do need/greed on those, you're systematically benefiting the needers, and the greeders likely won't ever have it made up elsewhere.
---
In the case of extremely rare and valuable BoE gear, that also won't even out over any reasonable amount of time, so everyone should need on those as well.
---
Break point?
---
&gt; It was initially released as **a game mode for League of Legends** for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019, and is scheduled to be released for Android and iOS in 2020
---
Rejuvenation on tank or someone who is getting damaged and then cast Healing Touch Rank 4 on anyone with less than 80% HP.  
---
Problem would appear if there's second RDruid in raid. Because HoTs do not stack - only one of you would be healing. (Person with 3/3 Improved Rejuv will override Rejuv of druid without it).  
---
If I'm single druid in raid - I'm in top-5 healing. If there's two - one would be in top-5, second would be last :)
---
Alright thanks for checking. I wasn't sure since I was on earlier today.
---
Water is nothing. The worst is stamina buffs, it takes like 1700 mana for a stamina buff, so I have to sit and drink after 2 buffs.  People getting vex cus im not buffing them all 30 secs b4 the bg starts lol
---
I'm pretty sure all the people who are ganking at FP with rank 8 are honor farmers buddy.
---
Horde has queues. They gank in the meanwhile.
---
Well duh, Tauren’s don’t have shadowmeld, but just because you lack a racial doesn’t make the one you have is superior.
---
Appreciate it but tbh we're not great, mid-tier on server like 7th on speed/execution as a guild. I still don't have a legendary parse for every fight in MC only like half so... not super great but we're doing alright I guess. I also was over a month late to start playing classic which is prob why I'm barely top 100 ranked healer on our server :/
---
Its not as good as raid gear, but better than some other classes' dungeon sets. Once the quests to upgrade them is released they will be competitive with tier 1 raid gear.
---
&gt;Is there any alliance left?
---
There's a guild called &lt;Leftovers&gt;. I see them occasionally out in the world.
---
&gt;What is the horde doing without any world pvp?
---
Raiding, farming mats, BGs.
---
&gt;Did the actual horde population suffer because of the mass alliance exodus?
---
I'd say we lost maybe 30% of the horde population. The top guilds stayed.
---
I'm a holy priest sheep on the alliance side haha. They've all rode off to drekthar ...
---
I haven't stopped queuing, but reduced it after hitting exalted yesterday. I'm also way more on fighting and don't mind having longer BGs now.
---
I agree with you. I should not be holding my own against a raid geared 60. Perhaps AV should only be for 60's, or there should be a separate 51-59 bracket. The disparity between 60 and 51-59 is too much.
---
Damn I never really cared about 100% mount but after playing AV 100% mounts are essential. I wish buying gold was an option. 800g for a casual player is no joke
---
Im thinking about doing it just because I don't really like the look of giant/dragonstalker armor. IDK what I'm gonna do when everyone is in Naxx gear though. I guess die a lot.
---
There's a hunter with Dal'Rend's on the bottom left... every weapon is a hunter weapon I guess.
---
Seeing as how av is a group effort not unlike a dungeon or raid, it's up to us as mages to be the real G, and prepare a bunch of stacks prior to starting. Acting like it's offensive to help your team in a videogame informs us more on your short comings than the people requesting help. 
---
You want a good BG? Play your class and hook up the other mans users if they need help.
---
95% of the level 60 population that are PvP'ing right now are spamming AV constantly because it is, by far, the highest Honor/hr you can do, and the exalted rewards are quite nice.
---
Obviously, this post applies to the vast majority of people PvP'ing right now.
---
You are the one who came in here comparing your level 40 WSG bracket experience to what 95% of people are doing right now.
---
To be completely honest with you, I didn't think anyone would think this was about Warsong, I kind of assumed they would understand it's specific to the current honor farm meta, not the 5% of people off being special snowflakes playing 20 levels down in the 40-49 WSG bracket.

I don’t really care how av turns out anymore. I got exalted in two days because I knew the zerg strategy would become more and more unsuccessful over time which is why I earned rep as quickly as I could. I’m all about just having fun in av now :)
---
Thanks for the information man, I'll check into it after work I think. Cheers
---
OMG guys I am so sorry. You have no idea how shitty it felt running around ganking and corpse camping people for 4 weeks straight. As someone trying to rank competitively, this was one of the best honor farms available to me as a solo warrior. It's my fault but also blame blizzard for the shitty design of early phase 2. You can come kill me and get revenge any time you want &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I actually agree with that
---
Purple suit
---
Neither of those. Most efficient is premading AV and rushing base for 5-8 min games
---
Hell yeah brother good luck on the grind :)
---
💯

Part of your argument is that people are unprepared by not having food and water already.  Doesn't that apply to you as well?  Aren't you unprepared if you dont have food and water for other people?  It's the same concept and you can't just dismiss it as part fo your class because you don't want to do it while saying other people are unprepared.
---
There are better arguments to make than the one you did.
---
Mages do actually hold a monopoly on mage food and water.
---
That's why it's called mage food and water.
---
And as far as I know, vote AFK to kick was disabled recently for BGs, so yes, it is quite hard to kick the mage in your BG from said BG.
---
Not that he could charge you in the BG in the first place. Did you even read any of the OP, or did you just jump to a really silly conclusion that makes you look really dumb?
---
I mean, the warrior one looks kine of meh to me, not symmetric at all...
---
I would, if I was collecting a vanity set, go for lightforge.
---
Hell, if I can wear T2, I would not be making a paladin alt rofl.
---
Ahh. Didn't consider that. Thanks for the info.
---
Wtb those drop rates in our guild. 
---
But now if you’re a paladin, we had one walk in to mc as a fresh 60 and leave with his t1 5 set
---
If you have your succubus out it'll immediately CC them when they jump you, then you can either wait out the cc and cast a full fear (or mortal coil if they trinket that fear) and you get your dots on them and they die, Undead can completely avoid the fear so they can stick on you the full time which means there's no real way outside of consumable advantages that you can win, but generally there's not much a rogue can do to stop you from getting some cc off pretty early on in the fight. The only way they'd win is if the warlock makes a mistake in the fight, otherwise the best case scenario is Rogue opens with stun, succubus starts casting Seduction, rogue trinkets the CC (otherwise he's probably dead following the fear immediately after the stun ends), rogue tries to either kill the succubus quickly after blinding the warlock or keeps attacking the warlock and blinds the succubus so it doesn't CC him again, no matter what he's used his trinket so you can trinket yourself, mortal coil him instantly and cast a full length fear with dots. I genuinely can't see a way they win outside of killing you in the 1.5 seconds that seduction takes to cast.
---
Maybe they could Blind the succubus before it casts the seduction, I could see that working well, though I think it casts the fist seduction whilst invisible the whole time so maybe it's not possible before the first CC hits.
---
Did you play on thrall in wrath?
---
That seems like the wrong comparison though. Flash heal is priests fast inefficient heal. Isn't the better comparison regrowth rank 3+ which has a 2 second cast time base
---
With a 1 min 30 second cool down id use it at the beginning of a boss fight and try to use it again. Also use it on CD during trash pulls
---
Instant. *laughs in Alliance*
---
&gt; Mages do actually hold a monopoly on mage food and water.
---
No you dont, you can easily be replaced by another vending machine that will work properly when kicked, like it should be. Stay in your lane little guy.
---
Because they farmed the recipe for hours or bought it for a ton of gold? Are you seriously comparing you clicking your trainer for a spell to someone spending hours farming crusader?
---
I've been in several "premade" AV's with people from Herod and Faerlina and they were the most organized and efficient wins I've had. I agree that everything about Twitch is terrible, but I've definitely not had the same in-game experience that you have had.
---
Oh yeah no doubt, you just won't see him as Boomkin outside IF was my point. From what I gather he respecs to literally just stand there and trigger paladins.
---
"sorry rogue, your daggers are ALSO bis for our fury/prot warrior, you'll have to wait until next time"
---
Yes, of course, this is what's going to happen. However, it might remain a steady honor gain for PUGs (if you queue as pug in WSG you're gonna have a bad time). Right now, main driving factor is still rep gain.
---
horde warrior on blaumeux myself. just getting to brd and such to gear for my first raid. super pumped
---
Yes, if winning is the desired end result.
---
In the current AV meta, if you are an honor farmer, you don't care about winning or losing, you care about how quickly your games end, and how much honor you got in those games.
---
Not providing water to someone who wants to turtle in mid may actually be a net positive to your goals, depending on what they may be.
---
I don't really understand this logic.  You are absolutely free to play WoW however you want.  But you absolutely should not get mad when people don't group with you because you made the choice to play something suboptimal.  Also, many guilds are progression oriented.  While efficiently gearing your raid may or may not make a big difference for most guilds in the long run, as a meme spec, or suboptimal spec in one of those guilds you should expect to be given loot last.
---
I would consider it help from an outside source. Thrall can use magic, but you can't. You just got a magical cookie from someone who can, might as well have brought a shaman to spam heals on you while you were fighting, kinda the same thing to me. Magic cast by someone else to keep you alive while fighting.
---
Which ones? Most the sounds in this video are pretty new.
---
I know, it's crazy that people throw tantrums at me when I refuse to trade them water.
---
They are so selfish coming into a BG without the consumables required to PvP. Why would you screw over your group like that?
---
Any warrior can tank BRD though.
---
how is that even an option.... you know that's not possible without abusing the kick feature.
---
Yes, there are that many more horde players queueing.
---
i mod
---
No they're just compared to 2 weeks prior. Hate to break it to you, but you're getting worse relative to other people.
---
3 min on day 1.  9 min today.  US east
---
Yes, everyone who can do basic math knew this was going to happen.  The out number the Alliance by enough to create a 5 min queue vs instant every time at all times day or night.
---
Hey, so what's the BIS race for tanking rn? Its trolls in case you didn't know, and BIS right now for them is daggers. Try again.
---
Are you like this all the time?
---
thats what ppl are saying in wowhead, but i got netted in a BG and i cant for the life of me figure out what item was used
---
Yea, been using a similar build previously, but didnt have the 2h wep to do good dmg so switched out of it. Now I will have The unstoppable force to dish out some hurt.
---
You should have gotten your epic mount before gear that will be replaced in BWL, epic mounts are forever and should be bought first.
---
Nefarian
---
We only have 3 of us so that could be why our locks are so geared and have done mc like 15 times
---
Yeah I am.
---
I like the ability in retail to change specs/talents at any time. Although I think the best talent system was wotlk they allowed you to pay to unlock a second spec
---
Its ok! Longer queue times and alliance quiting AV means we go back to WPvP and alliance start crying again, it's a cycle of hatred!
---
Hey man, you're the guy making a snide remark to a guy who's just trying to be real.
---
We tried that. But alas, we are both Forsaken. Dark Lady watch over you.
---
Glad it worked out for you and your guild at least!
---
Biggest deal about it is really that he's not helpful in the least around the guild imo, but I don't feel like making a push to replace him on such flimsy grounds.

Are you sure it wasn’t Really Sticky Glue?  That’s a quest from durotar that gives you 10 net-like items for basically nothing. You only get 10 for the entire life of the toon though.
---
The mass exodus of ally was a sad day for pvp. Spent hours looking for a fight after that
---
Ports actually cost a reagent though.
---
Faster attack can help with Frenzy uptime, but otherwise yeah there's otherwise no advantage to attack speed in PvE

No water, no heal/res

reports do shit in BGs, literally nothing.
---
Man, I love murdering warlocks who get the jump on me and think there's no way I can win as a rogue. It's hard, but not unwinnable. It's trivial with a resto pot.
---
Whatever makes you feel better buttercup
---
Of course if i dont get water i wont heal you. Why should i spend gold (mana) healing you when you wont spend time (conjuring) water?
---
I've seen 70 of this post. Some of them get 20 upvotes, some get over a thousand. I dont understand this sub lol.
---
Lmao the exact opposite actually
---
Thanks for the info, I'm really curious if I can solo this on my warrior
---
Winning is not necessarily the desired end condition for all players in the BG.
---
The current honor meta dictates that you play games as quickly as possible with the highest honor / hour despite whether you win or lose.
---
In Alterac Valley, giving a bunch of water to people who want to turtle in mid ensures that the honor farmer has to PvP for 2 more hours that night to keep pace with his desired goals.
---
In that scenario, why would the honor farmer (if he is a mage) want to provide the tools of his own self-defeat to his teammates?
---
Having a good BG for me means getting 3k bonus honor in a 10 minute AV game. I have no desire to turtle for an hour+ and I have no idea if the people I am giving water to have the same opinion as me. It does me no good to give anyone water if I don't know for sure their actions are actually going to be beneficial to me.
---
This is why AV cannot be equated to a dungeon or raid. The people in the dungeon or raid have a common end-goal, beat the dungeon or raid, and maybe get some loot or gold. People in an AV are often actively working against each others' goals because people don't share the same opinion on how AV is "supposed to be played". Battlegrounds are cross-realm as well, which means that no one has to be on their best behavior either, so they may actively grief you just for the hell of it. I have seen people get water, and immediately AFK out of the BG just because there is no consequence to them doing that.
---
I mean, do you actively do things that force you to spend more time than you want on your desired activities? When you take the trash out, do you rip open the bag and dump the contents all over the street, just so you can pick up the trash again, toss it into a bag, then toss it into a dumpster, just to spend more time taking out the trash?
---
Rogues can also vanish the seduction. 
---
And really, succubus is not good in group PvP. Anytime it’s not stealthed it’s gonna die immediately. And it can even die to AoE while invisible.
---
It’s not worth having a better chance at beating a rogue. Felhunter offers so much more including catching a rogue out before they can catch you
---
Wait for real? What phase does it change to emp?
---
Now I understand why there is so much confusion in vanilla who it drops from.
---
Dkp makes low value items go to homes where they can see use and the top people are held in check largely by wanting to be able to bid more than anyone else on key items. 
---
No system is perfect but DKP silent bid with some small loot prio rules is the best I've discovered
---
&gt; Time is money
---
And yet you want to waste your own time by not giving people food/water, can you make up your mind?
---
BG weekends may pop in Phase 4, would like it earlier.
---
Hi! Yes, it's definitely possible although I myself have had some troubles locating the NPC they are hidden in a secluded area with a short path coming from the main Alliance hub.
---
Now how much damage are you losing out on by stacking spell dmg.
---
Helps dot classes for fights with movement. Otherwise not much changes.
---
I mean you aren't going to find many mmos these days that dont have some gold sellers and cash for gold options. 
---
All the bots I've run into are hunters and their pets names are in Chinese. Half of them melee. One time in arathi I tagged everything before the bot and he helped me kill rock elementals for 2 hours I got like 25 elemental earth it was great. Funny this is the person must have come back to the computer cause he spat on me and logged out. He came back 30 min later and tried to do his bot again and I just kept stealing his tags for another few hours while he went in afk bot mode.

I made this comic after leveling a tauren for a while and I was using my memory as a reference.. but as it turns out prarie wolfs in mulgure are like the one animal type that doesnt have the 'young' prefix for their weakest variation.

---
&gt;Stay in your lane little guy
---
I am staying in my lane. It's you who is straying outside of yours, trying to dictate the value of services you likely don't or can't offer yourself.
---
Do you also tell your grocer how much they should be charging for a gallon of milk, then kick him until he gives it to you for free and tell him to, "Stay in your lane little guy"?
---
Additionally, I'd love to see some rule against the endless "Blizzard bad Classic bad" circlejerk posts.
---
Feels like this subreddit is full of folks who just want to paint their bottomless cynicism on everyone else, who would rather complain about the game nonstop than play it, or god forbid move on to something more fun for them.
---
And it's just killed my want to browse the sub, to the point where I have already unsubbed from it.
---
This is great. All these hordes replying with their pea brains already forgetting that this is all anyone had to say to an alliance complaint on being part of an imbalanced server. Sure feels good.
---
I meant more time.
---
I mean, yeah, AV was always the least-popular battleground, despite people having rose-tinted-glasses over "muh multi-day AV battles".
---
WSG and AB were always more popular, especially on private servers. People only do AV for the rep; the smaller scale of WSG and AB is preferred for actual group PvP content.
---
I'm genuinely surprised at this comment sections restraint.
---
What is a turtle ?
---
But not every alliance is pvping constantly.
---
A lot more people went horde due to "pvp advantage", but are finding out, the queues are brutal.
---
Millions of retail players, its what keeps the classic wow lights on.
---
the joy of automated systems .. we will never know how they actually work ..
---
Luckily the restriction is only in AV, not in my server at all. Didn't know that when I made this post. I'll get my last 4k rep then never set foot there again !
---
try selling soulstone buff
---
Mount bracket is top 1.4%
---
That is an abysmally small percentage.
---
Dude good luck! Being a warrior is amazing!!! Once you get good critical gear you will be nuuuukin shit up!  It’s awesome. Good luck!
---
Would this work with /who AV since everyone is always in the raid group?
---
I did it and I wouldnt suggest it to anyone. I respec'ed to feral at level 50 and was beating myself up for making it so hard on myself by leveling balance.
---
Ah I see. I suppose I'll give it a shot and maybe pm you if I run into problems in that case?
---
Lol hilarious. Ty
---
If it's done via warcraft logs you are only compared to your own class on the same fights.
---
Will you guys shutup? Of course you cant eat with dots. Dont try.

---
would have to be near an instance for that. and once every 30min dont worth it
---
What game were you playing? The only problem people had back then was an inability to bring the data together. Rushing AV was still a thing in the patch that promoted it (ie: the one they cloned for classic). If you want the slow AV, you want some patch other than 1.12.
---
The optimization we see in classic was absolutely present in vanilla. Hell, in some cases people were doing a better job of it in vanilla.
---
Itemrack my friend, thank me later
---
Til you run into mine so honestly don’t care how they normally go for anyone else.
---
Longer games are more fun for me. Win win
---
&gt; hunter trinket
---
You're gonna have to be way more specific
---
true, but at 10 silver, i m just gonna kill mob instead. Anyway thank for your answer, i think it was worth asking
---
Should have leveled a druid. Do it all in one class.
---
You don't deserve to be yelled at for refusing service, I definitely feel you that far. 
---
But not buffing your team before a BG is a hard sell my man.  I have a 60 mage as well, so I understand how overwhelming it gets when an entire raid asks for food/water, but it's also part of creating a successful and winning culture. 
---
While it's true they probably don't have your best interest at heart, they are more likely to work in unison with your goals if they are properly buffed during the 2 min period.  I would also argue you probably gain a lot of honor from objectives other people in the BG completed, so you can't say if any given person is workign with you or not.  I am very deep into the ranking system myself, 1.5 weeks away from your stated goal to be exact, and I have found it's far better to work with people on your faction when doing so, not against them.
---
You also work off of the false assumption we don't have access to free summoned food.  Most people are in guilds and can get it and the buffing period isn't a time you could be generating gold else where.  You don't deserve the treatment for refusal, but your refusal to do so isn't some behavior we are going to relate to, especially when many of us just click the damn button, it isnt a big deal.
---
They have 3 games in development right now. And league of legends is constantly receiving updates and is one of if not the biggest esport around.
---
&gt; Do you also tell your grocer how much they should be charging for a gallon of milk
---
No, because they have to go through hours of work to get that gallon of milk. 
---
Milk cost a lost because it takes a shit ton of work and a lot of time to make.
---
Your mage food is FREE because it takes no work and seconds of time to make.
---
Why would you compare mage food to actual real food? Are you really being serious right now? 
---
And you are a Target in a ocean of Walmarts. No one is going to go to the shittier version that charges more.
---
Thats why you dont hold a monopoly on mage food. Because theres 1000s of other mages that will do it for free. Nice monopoly you got there buddy.
---
Fairbanks says it can't be cleansed too. And yet Tirion just picks it up in the DK starting zone and it's cleansed.
---
More like World of Retconcraft amirite guys?!
---
Good rogues have shadow reflector or their insignia has fear. The rogue has to be absolute shit to lose
---
Warlocks turn into unkillable gods when paired up with Paladins. Without a Paladin grouped with them, they arent as good.
---
Not even close dude. Horde greatly outnumber ally
---
Lol no, there’s a reason why most of the playerbase considered vanilla to have really fun pvp even though everything is unbalanced as fuck
---
That are changing things!
---
Any grammar errors you’d like to point out while you’re at it? Holy omega
---
Wie bitte?
---
You might find a 30 min turtle fest fun, many of us do not
---
How does that waste my time?
---
If my team loses AV faster, I will save time because my honor grind will be shorter as my Honor / hr is much higher in those conditions.
---
This means that I will gain rank faster and ultimately be able to go PvP the way I want to since I no longer have to care about rank.
---
Spelt? Imposter.
---
It is, but that is a per week basis once people begin hitting rank goals., they drop out of the system and new people replace them.  It's still early, so that hasn't happened yet, but were approaching ranks soon where it will. 
---
Lots of people know to play the long game and casually rank and push more when needed.  More than 1.4% will get their mounts overall.
---
Rank 14 was never about skill moron
---
i can already imagine PvE alliance players complaining about how they have to endure ques to avoid the gankfest  #entitled. Along with PvP horde players showing this sub-reddit what pure rage is.
---
Lol a 10 min queue would be nice. Oceanic horde are already up to 40 mins
---
If I’m trying to get stuff done, I know what I’m capable of and what I can do. I have an active life outside of wow, and I don’t have all day to play. I want to get as much done as I can as quickly as I can. If you suck at your role in the group, I don’t want to play with you. I’m not going to feel bad for kicking you either if you say you can tank/DPS/heal and it turns out you can’t, and you’re slowing everything down for 4 other people. Suck on your own time, but don’t expect to get carried because you enjoy being lazy and bad at things. It’s a really easy game, it’s 15 years old, it’s full of guides. If you’re actively avoiding making good choices I have no reason to engage with you.
---
Small server? Bad time? Idk my /who is full when I tried now 1:20AM
---
This is not at all what the complaints have been about, wtf haha. Have people read this sub the past days? The only complaints here have been from the people hating on rankers/min-maxers telling everyone to "just have fun" in AV and that you shouldn't care about getting max honor.
---
no
---
"Damn players not letting us just casual run to the end without dismounting for a free win...how fucking dare they PvP in a PvP battleground. The outrage I say!"
---
Give it a shot, couldn’t hurt, worse that could happen is you don’t get any interest.  You couldn’t be the first person with the idea, and it’s not a thing you ever see being sold, so their must be a simple reason why no one ever does it.
---
My only issue with AV is the fact that it's better honor than WSG for most players.
---
Read this sub and you'll see that it's the complete opposite, it's the extreme casual that hate on the min-maxers taking the fun out of their game not realizing extreme no lifing was always what was rewarded.
---
Yeh it can definitely go up to 30 seconds
---
look on the bright side, your experience isnt really made worse by you not being into pvp, since what you did at southshore and are doing in AV are hardly pvp to begin with. So you're really just doing the same grinds everyone else thats only doing it for the items is doing
---
Having 1.12 AV in patch 1.5 is the biggest change. Chances are you weren't able to get nearly this much honor in AV before 1.12, so blizzlike gameplay is for AV to be worse honor than WSG/AB while ranking is relevant.
---
Ask anyone who ranked pre1.10, they will tell you they mostly played WSG and AB
---
When the turd just doesn’t want to come out.  It’s like a turtle In the shell. Or the Horde just playing AV :O lol
---
This was my favorite thing going into Classic. My guild had so many people big talking how they couldn't wait to get to Rank 14. I laughed, because it's clear these people never attempted the grind before. Half of them have already given up, and the other half are already complaining about it.
---
Good times. I did that grind, not to rank 14 but rank 12, and it was mindnumbing back then.
---
Don’t blame the players. Blame blizzard for giving us 1.12 AV. People who turn games into turtles are still the worst
---
Maybe try and help explain what I got wrong then.
---
On an ugly ass dwarf
---
yeah no prob!
---
If he is top 10 dps as fury prot then it's really not needed for his raid team. 
---
sorry but the asshole is correct in this case
---
Every class levels to 60. Mages are the easiest to level.
---
By that logic, you owe me for leveling a tank and healer.
---
its a completely separate game... whatever dude lol
---
Yeah I meant like grinding out to 51 then try that. Guess we'll see!
---
Never coming back. Dear God its awful
---
Im sorry, I didnt understand... Probably ain't the only one... Right??
---
Dispel, heal, laugh
---
Seven hours in Warsong Gulch? How did you not want to die after three hours? I would go insane after seeing that much chaos. Premade or no.
---
Never had a queue over 2 seconds as ally on EU
---
"People who PvP in PvP battlegrounds are the worst"
---
Meanwhile zero self awareness that it's actually the idiots not capping a graveyard and refusing to dismount that are actually causing the turtle by making sure they'll respawn directly in front of the enemy's offensive.
---
I mean seriously why would you not cap graveyards then act surprised you spawned back at base? You literally made sure that would be the outcome.
---
Doesnt this reset your hearth cooldown?
---
That is what I did when I honor grinded in vanilla.  The only time we ever did AV was either real real late at night, on AV weekend, or if the queue times allowed us to coordinate a queue and get a whole guild run.
---
Aside from that it was ALWAYS wsg or AB.  That was the experience I was hoping for in classic, I am sad it's been nothing but AV by myself and no option to play with anyone I know.
---
There's 23 60s there right now... on Skeram horde.
---
So how does someone who isnt r8-9 know if they are honor capped or is there a way to figure out how much to grind?
---
Lvl 29 is so much better, lots more action and class variation, and most classes are viable. At 19 its like hunters and rogues galore. No variation.
---
Nope, people would rather act super intellectual and look down on others on the internet. Clearly the peasants aren't worth this big brain's time.
---
lol.. from my server too
---
The future is now old man :D
---
Lol get rekt
---
lol my autos hit harder than that (hunter)
---
Imo I don't care. Alliance is full of bad PvP players. I've won every single AV for the past 2 days.
---
When the only food in your inventory is lvl 45 buff food that only regens 2% of your total hp a tick.
---
Dead before the food buff.
---
Yeah no use in arguing with you if you don’t see the strategic advantage of not capping SH.  Logic does not apply to you
---
Look, you don't seem to understand the giant flaw in your logic.
---
You are a mage and part of the mage class is making food and water.  This is how it works.  If you are going to say you won't do it for people you are in a group with because it takes time and shit, then you are saying you don't want to do part of your job for the group.  Do you want healers or other people to stand there and naturally regen or do you want them to drink and make things go faster?
---
What your argument needs to be, what the entire argument comes down to is this, You don't want to do it.  There is no "They are unprepared" or some other justification bullshit.  You simply don't want to do it.  That's fine.  That is what your argument should be.
---
The problem you have in your justification is that you are taking shit and applying it only to other people and not seeing how application of your logic breaks down how the game is played.  You simply need to accept that your argument is simply "I don't want to do it".
---
You're the one taking really weird ass logic that kinds surgically applied to avoid the simple reality, You just don't want to give people water.  That's fine, admit it and move on. There is no high mindedness about the issue.

Craft your epics from tailoring and then drop. That’s usually what people do since once you have all your gear you can get from it you won’t make any money from it really and it’s not worth anything to you personally anymore. Herbilsm if your doing Marudon farm as ghost Mushrooms are worth a lot and Marudon is loaded with them. I make 100g every tueday just by doing 3-4 hours a week of farming blindweed at night. 10-15 stack and the prices varies 6-12g on tuesdays it tends to hit the high end of that any other day it’s more like 5g a stack. Ghost Mushrooms go for 1-2g each so think about that when your in Marudon running by all of them.

Been instant queue on alliance eu the entire time.  Should prolly reroll the real pvp faction ;)
---
It's great. One dude's yelling at everyone to rush drek, another to rush galv, and then we split, and then they argue,  and then we lose.
---
I can /who 2 guilds and find more people than that in Alterac Valley, lol.
---
The pve servers are just as bad balance wise.
---
What are u on about?
---
Good point I always forget alliance’s experience is completely different.  Horde are sol
---
Not sure about Warcraft Logs but there is an addon that tracks them GlancingMeter
---
It's the only quantifiable way to determine performance in a reliable and large scale way.
---
It allows guild leadership to analyse their members play style and identify any dead weight. 
---
Absolutely essential for any guilds that want to kill cthun/KT.
---
Without this data you are blind and trusting 39 people to all just tell you that they're doing good, honest!!!
---
Good thing I said faction, not server :)  
---
Your attitude sucks but like I said you do you.
---
I like if my ss is up and my dots aren’t quite enough to die to just hop back up to redot. I’ll trade 2 for 1
---
This is high quality, no joke
---
Nerf implies it was working as intended to begin with. It wasn't.
---
"on firemaw EU" its cross realm, it doesnt matter which server youre on, good morning
---
True but if you saw he even said its cause he misplayed it and got punished for it.

Had a rl buddy lose this on his rogue to his hunter wife. Really hoping their marriage survives, wife and I would hate to have to pick sides in that split.
---
If my game goes over 10 mins I just /afk easily sit the 15 min and back to grinding.
---
Pissed off Orc-Furys because all of our Rogues and non-Orc furys have main hands lol.
---
There are slightly more Horde than Alliance. What is a bigger point though is that Alliance won all the AV's in the beginning bringing them to exalted insanely fast.
---
We had about 13min first day, it's probbaly much longer now.
---
Ah, right. Honestly I haven't touched PVP Since Wrath so I had no idea how the system works. Cool to know!
---
That’s ridicu... actually. You’re right.
---
Also consider that the succubus' seduction is very powerful because warriors are completely defenseless against it and rogues will usually burn their WotF early which means you can coil -&gt; fear them as soon as the stunlock wears off. Most important of course is to always wear as much stamina and armour as possible. You don't usually think about armour for casters, but armour scales way better at lower values. Just having my Demon Armor up reduces physical damage by almost 5%, that's huge.
---
Yep, around 10 horde and can stall or wipe the zerg.  After that alliance mostly just give up trying and sit at their base.
---
I have to play it to get competetive honor
---
Yeah, and the REEEEE is old as fuck. I remember hearing it in that flash animation about the CS player who gets hacked and then shoots up his school or something
---
Sure does.
---
I'd love to see you stream yourself going up to every random mage in Ironforge or Orgrimmar and asking for free food and water.
---
Can you please show me? Because I am pretty sure 95% of them will tell you to fuck off and if you are lucky to find that 5% that will make you free food or water, I hope it was worth the time you spent getting on all of those ignore lists.
---
By the way, it takes generally 6 or so days /played to get from level 1 to 60 and then you have to complete a quest for level 55 water. That time is approximately equal to 8k - 10k gold with a reasonable gold farm or at $15 USD / hr it would be equivalent to over $2000 USD if you spent that time working a job instead.
---
How in the hell do people possibly think it costs nothing to make level 55 mage water? Someone had to level the mage and sacrifice the opportunity cost of that in game gold or real life currency to accomplish. How you can sit there and say "Mage water/food is free because it costs no work and seconds to make" is so laughably wrong on its face that I am pretty sure you are just trolling at this point. If you aren't trolling, God bless your poor soul for not understanding the concept of opportunity cost and the effort required to get to 60 in Classic WoW.
---
Go ahead, be my guest, level a mage to 60 so you can have free food and water. Just don't be mad that you deranked or that you're poor as a result because you didn't spend 150+ hours farming gold or honor. After you do that, you can let me know how "free" you think mage water actually is.
---
It’s a pre raid best in slot to have both dal rends on a Hunter. At least that’s what the guides say.
---
"yea no point in arguing with people who don't understand how me not capping a graveyard then spawning back at my own base due to my own actions is actually the other teams fault"
---
Lol k.
---
Have you perhaps tried to "Git Gud?" Yea know....maybe cap a graveyard before you die? Perhaps don't stay mounted as you run across the entire map skipping every graveyard you could cap?
---
I mean. If you can't figure out how that's done it's fine. We will just kill you repeatedly until you do figure it out. I enjoy killing people who don't know how to dismount, and will continue to do so.
---
What addon makes the items glow like that?
---
Yeah, I agree. I have fond memories of catchup in Wrath - an alt I made during Ulduar was using both easy uld bosses and Naxx 25 to gear, then ToC came out and the dungeon loot slowly phased Naxx out of the running but we were still clearing some of the easier bosses in Uld (Especially Hardmodes, we got really good at Deconstructor if I recall). Then ICC came out and it was EZ ToC runs if you needed them but between the 3 new dungeons and tokens it was all super accessible. Felt like an expansion where every tier of content lasted longer than just one tier. 
---
Not to mention Sarth groups were running basically every week on my server for the mounts. That was great fun.
