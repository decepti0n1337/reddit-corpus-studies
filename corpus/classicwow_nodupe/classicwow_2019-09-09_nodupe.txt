My brother has little time to play but wants to do a mage. What would be a good class to play with him?
---
You can get to lvl 60 solo without issues.
---
If you want to do 5 man dungons or group with people on the way it is possible without needing to talk a lot or join a vocal server. As for the very end game with 40 man raids or high end PvP you will probably need a guild, or wait until the pve content becomes trivial and join groups doing it without communication .
---
Gettin real fuckin tired of this fuckin bullshit fam
---
His comment implies he made more with herbalism. The AH is much more appealing to herbs than leathers.
---

---
I still do skinning just because I’m not in the mood to dabble in the AH right now and would rather just vendor it all.
---
Is Artisan Skinning worth it if I plan to switch to Engineering eventually?
---
Recently became a solo parent, had to cut down on work hours, my department is closing down soon, daughter needs all new uniform to start high school, so yea, times arent the best, and classic will be a welcome escape atleast for this month. But it's all good, suns still shining.
---
They had him in Goldshire last week. All the lowbies would have been able to burn him down if he didn't keep resetting.
---
My boss hates gnomes and alliance
---
I can think of someone in a prominent position this doesn’t apply to.
---
On last boss of DM. Tank pulls before I was ready. When he pulled I quickly casted ward, HoT, and then start casting my big heal.
---
The boss does some spike damage and tears through the ward and HoT can’t keep up and he dies a split second before my big heal finishes about 5 seconds into the fight.
---
We got through the whole dungeon without and wipe and the first thing he says after the boss wipe is “I didn’t even get a heal lol”
---
These people infuriate me...
---
Goddamn, thank you.
---
Paladin has a lot of cool buffs and they do a lot of single target crit heals
---
I know this DDOS is a total POS
---
Yeah, enjoy that negative honor trying to climb out and earn any real rewards
---
Well I mean we can just steal the healers mana with life tap
---
Ah dang I didn't know that :(  
---
Hope you can get one!
---
I wanted the Anduin sweater but its medium only -\_-
---
The more you allocate to servers in preventative form, the more resources you use. 1 uptick in an MMO in latency is huge. Now, normal operations aren't an enormous deal in a normal network. 
---
The combative measures requires enormous usage of bandwidth to detect each individual computer sending traffic. Multiply that by 1 million users. Now multiply that by a bother attacking. Good fucking luck.

It's really not viable until very high level with the right gear and talents.

---
Classic is 1.13. Vanilla was 1.12
---
I just hope blizzard offers fucking transfers out of Faerlina to any other realms. 
---
Fuck this streamers bullshit
---
Thank you
---
great, thats what I figures but I needed to be reassured.. Thanks buddy!
---
Um, may I suggest getting some additional bags?
---
Do they ever thank you? If I played on a PvP server and was a badass who safe people from ganks, I'd keep a folder of screenshots of whispers.
---
Oh please. Yeah let's all just say nothing about it because humans are not social creatures or anything.
---
About how long should a good SM library/arm run take at level?
---
Praise be unto RGBesus
---
Paladin/Shaman/Druid.
---
Mages cannot heal or tank, and any class that makes up for that shortcoming is good. Warriors are also really good, but without a heal you basically need to kill something before it kills you. 
---
As a mage you basically want to sit at the back and throw spells, if someone is attacking you then you're likely going to drop off the DPS in favor of surviving.
---
Come to the discord they’ve been running the addons, can’t remember what the last one had them at
---
I’ve seen many more friendly and nice encounters than encounters like this one. Unfortunately, there are always those types of people in gaming. They absolutely existed 15 years ago on release day.
---
That figure is before release.  Post-release puts estimates closer to 2:1.
---
Rip your inbox bro
---
Census addon will tell you your factions stats
---
Just to be pedantic, in local currency its closer to $1 a day, and I dont smoke and rarely drink, but maybe I can find money somewhere.
---
Kys?
---
You assumed I was arms, yikes!
---
Okay that's what I thought, thanks
---
Silly logic, if its boe blue, everyone needs it, you would be silly to use it in alot of cases, free easy money. there is at least a 99% chance that there is a better item in dungeons for you. BOE should never go to you just cause its an upgrade. imo.
---
I can’t wait till all these people are gone
---
Yeah what a sad setting to imagine
---
What kind of pussy helps out the other faction?
---
You see them struggle, you charge in and give them the finishing blow!
---
it stopped for about 18 hours, tldr still ddos
---
I mean I definitely see more racist shit on classic than retail but sure man whatever you say
---
Connect that to 20 servers, and 1million+ users hammering the network every second and you will have latency issues. In normal networks moving slower isn't an enormous deal but in an MMO latency is everything. I get what your saying but in an MMO it's much more difficult.
---
Wait a week
---
No he is saying your salary implicitly includes the "extra" overtime pay because overtime is a natural part of the work. Sorry but I'm definitely not strumming a violin for the poor souls who get to work salary at Actiblizzion lol.

The higher percentage rep discounts were later expansions.

When you see a lot of mixed opinions generally it means it doesn’t matter that much. Arms or fury is fine. Prot is too if you dont care at all about speed.

What level and server is this?

to be fair the only one that seemed to be working earlier today was Faerlina, at least from the streamers perspective. They could all log in while Thalnos and Herod and plenty of others were fucked

yes i do for a laptop, duno if 2600k has graphics but 4k series laptop does fine
---
[removed]
---
Find a guild, make some friends, level slower,work on crafting, make an alt. Some things you can do.
---
Blizzard has already said that a "low" population server now is higher populated than a full server in 2004. They've also said they'd merge servers if they need to.
---
There's literally no reason to play on Herod... the middle of the pack servers like Kromcrush, Surfuras, Bigglesworth, etc. have literally no threat of dying and don't run into the issues that the streamer servers do.

I've been leveling as Arms, currently lvl48.  Hamstring kiting is huge, and things speed up a lot once you get both Sweeping Strikes and MS.

How much is a bot net? Cheap enough that anyone could get one or is this something only select people could afford? Is this stuff going to become more common?

Probably Paladin. They’re a little boring to level but if you’re teaming up with someone the capability to tank and also heal will be wonderful.

And, of course, you are in Loch Modan. The Loch is the best place in the game. My Wow home.

Always maxed fishing and cooking but this time around it feels lackluster. Tender wolf steaks are dirt cheap from the brd aoe grind and nightfin soup isn’t selling at all. Might just fish Stonescale for armor pots :/. I do enjoy the 45 pound red gill offhand I fished up lol.

Looks like typical horde.
---
I know nothing I will say will change your mind because Blizzard fanboys are insane in defending them, but I joined with friends already put time in and Blizzard really dropped the ball on the popularity of the game.  There shouldn't be a queue on any server.  There's really no excuses for them but ya'll crazy ass hell to defend em.
---
Not really. Robbing a bank at least has the chance of profit. This gets him nothing tangible. Mainly for attention because he is lonely.
---
woodwind instruments are best instruments

A couple of them noticed cause I said "I'm putting grades in now so I can play classic all weekend"
---
Cool, thanks.
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to properly enjoy Classic WoW. The questing design is extremely realistic, and without a solid grasp of early 2000 theoretical game design, most of the developer's intent will go over a typical retail player's head. There's also the social aspect, which is deftly woven into the core game design - the personal philosophies of even basic quest design draws heavily from Jung's Collective Unconciousness, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have th intellectual capacity to properly appreciate the depth of this multiplayer design, to realize that they're not just quests - they say something deep about people. As a consequence, people who dislike Classic WoW truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the beauty in the design of quests like "The Guns of Northwatch", which itself is a cryptic reference to Plato's Allegory of the Cave . I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Alex Afrasiabi's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools. How I pity them. 
---
And yes, by the way, I DO have a Horde tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only - and even they have to demonstrate they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid.

please stop spreading fud. ddos protection can only do so much. this is a massive attack that would take down anything. these type of attacks have taken down banking systems, payment systems (happened to kroger a few times) fortune 500 companies, government, etc. stuff that does have the best protection possible. its hard to block ddos requests and why ddos are so effective.  they're not only attacking blizzard, but the isp they use, and even been attacking users isp's. blizzard actually stated this themselves. they are flooding everything.

That's what addons *used* to have to do, manually scan the auction house. For years now the API has included an API call for the auction house database - it takes a min or two at most, not sure why your addon isn't using that?

Stormwind definitely has a hunter trainer, it's in the Dwarven District
---
no, that's 2 wildly different things

I saw a comment saying something like "it's not easy to spot a good hunter, but it is to spot a bad one". As a new WoW player who decided to roll Hunter, what are some things I can do to be one of the good ones? I don't want people to see me as a "huntard", and despite playing an overpopulated role I'd like to be as useful as possible for my guild mates. Any advice?
---
hes being paid in free exposure
---
Exactly, to the people who were saying "don't give him attention", I don't give a fuck. I'm not super upset by this temporary inconvenience and honestly it's been more entertaining mocking him on twitter and watching all of this unfold yesterday with people finding his facebook account and IP address (assuming the facebook wasn't hacked, but even if it was no VPN would protect the real suspect from Blizz or the legal authorities). If he's loving the attention now, good for him but payback's gonna be a bitch and I sure will enjoy that more.
---
What does he have to gain out of this, such an idiotic thing. Like congrats you inconvenienced a bunch of people for a few hours.
---
Hire this expert, Blizzard
---
I'm all for people getting to use the drops they can equip. However, I've had too much shit stolen over the years from trying to do "need before greed". Any time I make a dungeon group I explicitly say everyone should roll need on any BOE's so that everyone has a fair chance. If someone absolutely wants to equip the item and everyone is ok with it then sure.
---
But I'm not going to have everyone essentially pass by rolling greed just so some pos can roll need after everyone else.
---
Yea dude, how can people find similar formats applied to different situations funny 
---
Thatd be crazy.
---
Thank god we have memes instead.
---
ahh yes, i use feign death and disengage, i have lvl 4 growl too atm.
---
Yeah, I'm not saying changing the IP address is hard, I'm saying it only buys you time until the attacker refreshes their DNS cache. As soon as they do, they're attacking your new servers anyway. Even if they've done something vastly more complex than DNS records to propagate the correct servers to use, they still need to let the clients know who to connect to and it's at that point that the attacker can always jump right back in. Queuing on that process only slows things down a little especially as a savvy attacker will be requesting the list multiple times from different clients so that they can keep the list as up to date as possible.
---
If you're down while the IP address move is being communicated out and as soon as you do the attack restarts, what did you actually gain by moving the IP address? You were still down the whole time and the attack is still ongoing.
---
lol, no one will probably even investigate it
---
truly this is the authentic classic experience
---
Even when you get in world server is down when you enter world
---
No its not. It's some basement trolls fault
---

Are you not ENTERTAINED?

Let me tell you, there's nothing better than sitting in a queue for 2 hours, getting in and then 5 minutes later the server goes down due to a DDoS attack....

Most likely yes.
---
Oh, what could the do then?
---
Blizzard has no control over this.
---
what?
---
Are you kidding lol? those people were definitely in vanilla.
---
why does leveling faster by selling the item matter? Not everyone is in a race to 60. You'll get there eventually with out the extra gold just by killing monsters.  I guess I'm trying to say you are starting from a false premise in thinking that gold&gt;item just because you could potentially level faster by selling it on the auction house. there are no guarantees that you'll even sell the item or that the player even cares for the auction house/economy aspect of the game.
---
Just shut the fuck up

I was questing with a level 42 Human Warrior name *Stalai* and after we split up I went in an opposite direction from him and met a level 42 Taruen Warrior named *Stalia*.  I rushed over to the Tauren Warrior and used the /wave and /beckon emotes to get him to follow me.  Thankfully he did and I led him back to Stalai where the two started to laugh and /cheer and /danced with each other.
---
oh that’s awesome, will have to try tomorrow! ( I play from EU so I’m already in bed) Thanks for the tip!
---
Honestly gotta admit I took a 30g loan from a warlock friend. I honestly started saving too late and ended up with 60g myself. if I were to grind it out further I would just go mobgrinding and skinning(did not take skinning, big mistake in hindsight) or dungeonfarming i suppose.
---
Are bigglesworth still down? It keep showing "You have been disconnected from Blizzard services."

What can they do to prevent it?

Cat is mad he doesnt get one

Hey what server are you on by chance? :^)
---
it scans items as you search for them as well.
---
search for light leather and it will store that price for you in about 2 seconds
---
This should be a movie
---
This is one of my biggest fears about coming back. It didn't used to be this way back in Vanilla and I fucking hate people who swapped factions because of racials and/or they saw a streamer playing Horde. 
---
Especially* in classic it suuuucks when the factions are so imbalanced. Long as BG queues and world PvP isn't near as fun
---
It kinda does, befriend a mage. xD
---
too soon

It's a deliberate action to be an asshole by somebody.

Tbh if you are hurtin that bad you should probably play a free game.
---
SPAM
---
Arms is a bit easier to hear for earlier
---
Fury is the highest dps in the game if you can gear for it
---
Prot spec is fine but slow. The spec makes you more survivable but doesn’t really increase threat generation. This means you can spec for dps and tank most sub 60 instances. 
---
I’d say go arms until you can farm bis gear
---
Honestly if you are a begginer you should'nt go engineering.  It's the hardest profession to level up,  a real money vaccum and you probably won't be able to use it properly. 
---
Most people I see don't even use their whole Toolkit and Skills... No reason to had some bomb/lazer beam/etc to make things more complicated.  Go tailoring and Enchanting or Herb/Alch
---
When yesterdays DDoS  stuff happened I couldnt log in but all my friends who were in Eastern Kingdoms could. Seems just Kalimdor is having issues when the servers go back up. I suspect something similar is happening again.
---
I d/ced in Kalimdor and still cant log in either.
---
What is this? And how did you find it?
---
Are you mad blizzard didn’t launch classic at the beginning of summer vacation?
---
I mean I don’t think anyone is worth ddosing like that but let’s no belittle regular people.
---
I don’t know anything about these people but I don’t think it’s right to make fun of person for their looks.
---
Software that completely uninstalls and removes any trace of the old drivers in your machine, if you do a regular uninstall it might leave some archives that could mess with the new graphical option.  
---
  Before installing the cpu graphical drivers, I'd recommend uninstalling all graphic drivers with ddu, nvidia, amd, intel, whatever, and then install the latest driver for your gpu, or roll back if this issue happened right after a driver update.   
---
  Sounds like it's problems with your gpu driver.
---
&gt;And my point is I don't see how their notoriety benefits them or harms others beyond being offended by the crime
---
The benefits they get are a personal thing. It's ego.  It harms others because it perpetuates the attacks.
---
&gt; That perceived position of power is nothing more than a 15 minutes of fame followed by the highly probable consequences, which if in this case is jailtime like the last time this happened means the guy won't be able to do anything else to gain attention for a long time and people will just forget about it a week later. 
---
Welp.  The attacks are still happening, and there are collectively tens of thousands of people who can't play.  This person will keep this up for as long as they can if they keep getting the reaction they want.  It's like meth for them.
---
Probably not as much as he'll be fined, and unable to pay off once he's out of prison because he'll be banned from any job that requires use of a computer.
---
I know they were... I’m not saying anything against the transfers, I’m just saying this is the start of the infamous WoW store on Classic.
---
Wow
---
I let I play cause I said on Friday during my last hour "I'm putting in grades now so I can play classic all weekend" 
---
A couple of my kids caught on
---
I don't think so. If you find one please reply back.
---
40 year olds aren't boomers. I'm 50 and I'm not even a boomer, lol. Boomers weren't gamers when they were kids... most Gen-xers were because our childhoods were spent in arcades in the '80s. 😁
---
Bigglesworth has not been down for hours at a time. Ive been on all day.

They are doing their best. Bitching wont make it any better.

Found the streamer fanboy.
---
u mad
---
"Don't talk about it!", while on Reddit talking about it.
---
You can only get a rename if that name is already taken on the other server
---
Phases mean when new content is released, the next raids, pvp ranks etc untill all of vanilla wow is released
---
new races are only coming in the next expansion so they are not coming in any phase.

I was about 3 pulls away from Mograine in smCath.
---
So close to finishing my quest and getting my sword.
---
But no, it was all for naught. I rage quit and shut er down, off to work in the morning...
---
I'm sad.
---
Read this guide, it helped me a lot.
---

---
Look at the BiS gear list at the bottom.
---
As soon as possible do dungeons, gear up and try to not fight same level or higher and rely on the hamstring method. Warriors are a lot of fun once you get your rotation, kiting and gear right.
---
It's the weekend lol. Also, one guy affecting wow servers for a couple hours on a saturday won't influence anything even for a 1 week contract.
---
Yeah think I agree, and I think less people will do it than expected as well. Like everyone is hoping everyone else will leave.
---
At level 11, you can justify using haggard's axe for a bit. You want to charge, rend, and then heroic strike with extra mana. The important quest rewards to work towards are filthy paws (loch modan mail chest), murkdeep in darkshore (mail belt), vagash (2 handed hammer that also vendors for money when you are done with it), and the shield from old one eye in westfall (you want this to tank deadmines with, but you don't need it before about level 18). 
---
Your best talent by far at this level is improved rend, and arms beats fury at low levels. 
---
Once you have rend maxed, I put 2 points in deflection then match improved charge. Again, more rage, and this starts really mattering at 22 when you get  much better rage dumps in sunder armor and cleave (you get cleave at 20).
---
really though, warrior lives and dies by their gear. A good armor reduction is 25% without a shield and 39% with, at your level. A good weapon... is whatever you can get, honestly. 
---
Also, it is important to get your gear squared away around level 15, as you have to kill van cleef to get the chausses of westfall and he is honestly a bit of a gear check for tanks. So I would really focus on questing to get the important gear, ESPECIALLY filthy paws in northern loch modan. All that stamina on the ironheart chain is quite important.

Interesting. What makes Kang so desirable? The others are BiS in some way, whether that's for lv 60 or for twink brackets. Is Kang bis at 49?
---
Thanks for your advice. Got a follow up question if you don't mind.
---
Is it really 10 seconds before aoe? I've been making big mistakes here then lol. I draw aggro from the tank very often, you mean to tell me this is my fault and not the tank? Lol

mirror mapping is simple considering the ocean floor and sky are parallaxed, with water being translucent.

I'm locked out due to the whole DDoS thing, but I believe you want to go into interface, camera, and then set the camera auto-follow to 'none.'
---
It might still be worth something. A lot of casuals don't look at theorycrafting. Hell, most hunters I met don,t even know slow bows are better so far. The economy will be a bit different than what we saw on private servers which had a high percentage of serious gamers.

"Perhaps you know the pain of uncertainty, perhaps not, Warrior. But know this: I stand here every day, from the sun's rising till its decline, scouring the horizon for more of those monsters. I've killed every DDOSer I've come across since, but my thirst for their blood is far from quenched. Perhaps instead of heading north to the Crossroads I should have headed to Taurajo.

The level caps for vanilla were every 10 levels though, so 20/30/40 etc

The Horde would like to know your location.
---
You can tank on a Druid just fine. Go you tube skarmtank. 
---
I would go full farel build while leveling. I’ve healed, tanked, and DPS’d in that build so far by just swapping gear and managing down ranked heals. But yes jack of all trades during a dungeon run is the mark of a good Druid. It is a very deep class.
---
Still play osrs to this day, about to get my second 99 with another 4 close, planning to max by summer 2020 :)

Dalaran was one of the original seven human kingdoms that formed the Alliance during Warcraft 2, along with the elves, dwarves, and gnomes. It was destroyed during the Burning Legion invasion in Warcraft 3, in an awesome cinematic I will post below. Anyway the survivors put a big purple bubble around it to rebuild. In World of Warcraft, before Wrath of the Lich King, that bubble was in game.

---
Oh so that's what it's for lol. I vendor all mine lol
---
Actually, I rolled PvP because all my friends wanted to roll PvP. I don't give a fuck, I would have rolled PvE if I had my choice.
---
Just drop man.
---
thank you so much for saving that lmaoooo
---
F
---
Yes but healers must be very geared and good, and they pop mana potion and dark runes for mana on cooldown. Not a strat for beginners.
---
That is some next level shade throwing.
---
is there a addon for auto quest accept? i was watching joker's 1-60 run and he seems to just spam click the quest giver to get the quest...
---
It's so surprising that they would want to keep a server with a majority of their playerbase online...
---
Maybe everything doesn't revolve around streamers?
---
It's not a DDOS.  They're saying SOME isp's are affected so that wouldn't explain why NOBODY can play.
---
I'm using the wifi hotspot from my phone and I still get dc'd from the realm selection screen.  I doubt anyone is DDOS'ing Sprint and/or PDA Net right now.
---
Here’s your middle ground; Get them to equip the BoE if it’s an upgrade. They get their upgrade, they can’t sell it on for gold. Sorted. 
---
If I roll need on a BoE and people get shirty I just offer to equip it and everyone is happy.
---
That's why they should have tweaked certain things about classic. Would anyone really have complained if humans got their 'normal' free trinket racial? No fucking way. 
---
But cmon...the racials aren't *that* much better for PvP besides maybe WoTF. And even then gnomes have escape artist. It's just fucking sheeple following the masses and streamers. I hate it so much
---
Not to get all philosophical on you, but love and hate aren't opposites, they're two sides to the same intense coin, the opposite to which is apathy. If you truly didn't care, you wouldn't have commented.  
---
But to answer your question, taking as a given that people are right when they say that his effect on the community is a negative one, the fact that he regularly tops stats on Twitch with 50-110k viewers watching him play this game every night is, one way or the other, still necessarily *relevant* to the game and to its community.
---
I gave up trying to play Classic this weekend, ended up finishing leveling my main to 120 since I haven’t played in a few expansions. Really made me appreciate how much worse the leveling experience is in retail compared to classic. Sigh
---
I’ve got good news and bad news...
---
Various mobs in swamp of sorrows, anything skinnable
---
They probably do and they probably are protected. I have the feeling though that this was large scale enough that even their protection was not good enough. I don’t think a profit driven company like Blizzard wouldn’t have some of the best technology already, especially when they know they are prone to these attacks. Hence why it seems a bit ridiculous to complain about them not having any protection...
---
In addition to the other things said, please make sure your pet won't body pull. If your group is dropping down a cliff to skip enemies usually your pet will take the normal route and bring everything you wanted to skip to you at once!
---
And in pvp it's probably learning to kite well more than anything. Learn when it's appropriate to move into melee for attacks like wing clip and know that the enemy won't snare you in the hunter dead zone. Know when it's safe to use Cheetah mid fight, etc.
---
Can you get to the character screen then try to load to promptly get disconnected? Like man I just wanna fish....
---
When does that info typically become available?
---
Yes you can buy a lot more than just a botnet with “onions”.
---

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-leveling-classic-wow
---
Analyze what you can improve?
---
Usually when you die alot it's the game telling you that you are doing something wrong.
---
As a warrior I would check my weapon first as it is the most important equipment. 2H Arms is what I would recommend for leveling. Aim for high weapon damage (even staffs can be good)
---
Where are you stuck? Westfall? Westfall is a terrible leveling zone for warriors. Consider exploring Loch Modan and Darkshore.
---
Make sure First Aid is up to date. Even cooking combined with fishing.
---
As a warrior try to always do quests where you are fighting mobs that are on your level or below.
---
Those would be my tips for new warriors.
---
Grats man, I just hit 29 I can't wait to trade out Humar for Brokentooth. How long did it take you to get him?
---
Let's do the math. Even if you're out 8hrs total from the DDOS that works out to 
---
$15/30days
---
30days=720hrs
---
But you sleep 8 of those hours each day. So 720-(30x8)=480
---
$15/480hrs=$0.03
---
You're out 3 cents worth of time with 8hrs of DDOS.
---
maybe someday we can log back into Bigglesworth
---
oh ok then:)  give this a shot - https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20761766581
---
Any way to find when and which is active? Randomly found today Harvest Festival quest outside Org
---
I would recommend levelling a Hunter with skinning and herb or mining.  Sell everything on that Hunter to fund your warrior.  SO gear dependent.   I had a bank alt that I logged onto occasionally to check the AH for choice greens levels above my warriors current level just to maintain gear.  Beyond that it's potions/food/bandages. 
---
If you've never tanked 5-mans I would champion that hard.  Worth it to watch videos of the dungeon first or send your Hunter in there to scope it out.
---
Pretty sure the answer to the second question is no, but why not just test it with a cheap item?
---
Retail takes the journey out of the game and turns everything into an easy mode race for instant gratification, which turns out to be an incredibly boring, anti social experience where nothing is exciting and hyper balance removed most of the unique aspects to classes and professions.  
---
I get excited in Classic from the smallest little things, from pulling  extra mobs in the world with survival on a knife's edge, passing others on the journey and choosing to help or hinder, a few extra stats on some new gear, all the glorious trade chat spam, racing to the zeppelin/boat, venturing to trainers to rank up and checking vendors for rare patterns or just that talent point your looking forward to get on every single level up that makes you feel that bit stronger. 
---
Nobody cares about any of this in retail, instead you are expected to race to level cap by grinding dungeon finder with heirlooms, race to gear up with mythic+ and random lucky titanforged gear, grind your AP endlessly in world quests and repeat them everyday to be able to raid - the only content where socialising might happen and even then there is raid finder where you never have to speak to a soul or be truly challenged. Then you log off till next week for resets and wonder why your subscribed to a game that offers such a mundane lonely experience.
---
can you link the macro
---
Already posted it there ;)
---
You are 100% pissing off tanks and other group members lol. 10s isn’t a rule and moreso what I’ve been doing (lvl 60 with enough experience). And no, “fixing” your mistake with feign death isn’t great. There’s a chance your tanks haven’t been good, but you have to work with them. They take the hits, not you.
---
It’s 2019. Blizzard will probably hire him to prevent this sort of thing in the future. What a society we live in.
---
Whatever. I am just going to play the Sims while I try to log in over and over again. The same thing i used to do 14ish years ago on patch days when we couldn't log in anyway. Nostalgic feels!

I trust your answer I'm going home.

Yup. I just left the city too

They can use the $ they saved by not paying their 2018 taxes. Or the $200 million they received from the government the same year. Look it sucks we can't play but they are to blame. Fuck them.
---
Nice
---
There was a message from the server saying it's going offline in 1 second.
---
Nice.
---
Stalagg confirmed dead.
---
Yup. So did a few others
---
Idk how many people are making twinks yet, which would probably boost the value. I’d think that would really start to flourish after people have hit level 60 on a main toon first.

Wow...you got really upset with his comment lol
---
Yeah they are not worth 46 billion ... lol that would make them one of the largest companies in the world.... but they are much larger than I thought! They had revenues of about 8 billion in 2018. A rough guess I would say they are worth 10 - 15 billion.

Ohhh that's why people play Pallys

I'm looking for a good, easy to use warlock guide if anyone has one!  Pictures of the spells and stuff are cool so I can try to remember what spells are when looking at them
---
Didn't blizzard say that is impossible to get accurate info on? Because when they were talking about peoples layer checking strat where they /who they were saying it wasn't accurate.
---
They're in a heavily contested area where it's basically no man's land and fights break out spontaneously. 6 horde player decides to gang up on a mage who ice blocks to buy precious seconds but things are looking grim.
---
The warrior in the upper right corner, Chestnutz, sees the situation and without hesitation, charges into battle despite being heavily outnumbered in an attempt to save OP. According to OP's follow up post, he dropped an intimidating shout fearing them all away and allowing OP to blink away and sprint to safety.
---
But the warrior almost assuredly died sacrificing himself for a random stranger.
---
Hmm I stand corrected. Is that why private server add-ons don't work on classic.
---
Oogabooga, OP has a caveman brain.
---
yep just got kicked mid dungeon. annoying

1 sec restart heads up lol

Yep in the middle of a fight

What seems fair is need before greed. If you need the item as an upgrade, need it. otherwise hit the gold coin because all you want to do is sell the item.
---
literally just got through the queue
---
right at the last boss LETS GOOO
---
Yup!
---
I'm afraid I'm not following you.
---
 I don't see what the overall economic efficiency has to do with how best to divide dungeon gear. And I don't see any way to share the item other than to sell it and divide the gold. I'm pretty sure that's not what you are saying.
---
I feel the exact same. Same with buffing! I feel like now people hardly throw out buffs just to help out compared to previous weeks.
---
They're the same picture

Thanks blizzard.
---
Skeram, queue times are like maybe 20 mins? Faction imbalance feels heavily horde dominated, can't quest anywhere at 38-42 without there being at least 5-7 horde there.
---
but but they were being mean to me! how else can i show my racism!
---
Same definition in wow honestly.
---
Looks like it is back up!
---
I do. You can make your servers strong enough to not crash from so many pings
---
I luckily got like 12 quests turned in prior but damn I think I played like 6 hours total this weekend due to this crap
---
0.01 second heads up too
---
lol i played on a vanilla private server three years ago before blizzard even hinted at classic, but yeah, it's blizzard tricking us.

WTF is happening?  I get the south park reference, but wtf is that word that starts with S and then has a stroke on the second letter?

I saw it, got halfway through "does that say 1 second...?", and got booted.
---
Stop upgrading your gear every time you ding, ah all your cloth, only buy important spells
---
Spoken like someone who has no fucking idea how a DDoS works.
---
Get out of here.
---
Just got in and then rip
---
Stalagg and Fairbanks too.
---
Lol you are so witty!
---
Yes, if I had billions of dollars at my disposal, I’m pretty sure I could just pay to not get ddos’d
---
It’s back online
---
Nope, PvP.
---
It's back up.
---
As a priest I will say this is an easy one.
---
"You win"
---
Its back up.
---
It's a DDoS, not their fault
---
shush
---
Everything is back up!
---
Or you can just give people the benefit of the doubt they will actually use the item and not just think about yourself for 5 minutes. 
---
If someone needs it in my group, they take it, and I’m happy for them. The logic of “I need gold” is bullshit, you don’t “need” gold, you WANT gold, the option is there for people who need the item.
---
Based on your logic anyway I wouldn’t bother playing with someone like you anyway, and thankfully I have yet to encounter someone like you in game, I’m sure I will eventually though.
---
They were.

Have you heard the latest Kardashian rumors?
---
I've been on Whitemane Horde since day 1 and have interacted with these guys out in the world quite a bit. I haven't instanced with any of them past very low level stuff, but never had a problem with them. They tend to join quest groups and complete the objective and leave all without saying anything, or using very short phrases to indicate what they want as they typically do not speak english. Some do, and talk quite a bit. Some have some english macros they've made for simple things. All in all, never heard someone actually say they've ninja'd anything or griefed anyone.

Bigglesworth has a battle going on between Alliance and Horde fighting over which faction has the most guilds with something related to the server name in the guild name. Example &lt;Bigglesworth Bois&gt;, &lt;Biggle Bois&gt;, &lt;Biggie Boys&gt;, etc.

Does he have shifty eyes? That's the giveaway

Waved at every horde in ashenvale that was even 1 lvl above me. They never attacked me. The one time i see this guy 2 lvls ahead of me with resurrection sickness i proceed to murder him.

Got insta karma'd tho as a troll hunter 4 lvls above me saw me do it and proceeded to murder me. BUT it turns out i wanted to log off, and my death actually teleported me to Astranaar where i wanted to go anyway.

Blizzard's servers are getting attacked, on a weekend (when a majority of their staff is at home, as they should be) so I don't know why you're mad at them.

No doubt. Trying to sell anything for a lot of money is madness imo. Some guy on my server trying to sell a dwarven hand cannon for 500g...

Not sure anyone even has that much gold
---
Incendius PvP High-Full pop server without streamers.
---
Typically short (&lt;100) before 4pm CST, but after it can go up to 2600 (roughly 58 minutes) which is getting better with the free transfers heading out.
---
From what I've seen so far there's a pretty good balance of Horde and Alliance, but it might slightly favor Alliance.
---
AH prices fluctuate so much still, but a lot of things sit at or just above vendor price right now.
---
Because there is no hacker here, just DDoS attacks.  If the receiver of the attacks can't track it nobody can, all they can do is keep mitigating the attacks and blocking connections to specific ips until attacker runs out

Try deploying a game like this to multiple regions with sub 50 ms latencies. This isn’t some restful application that is fault tolerant at layer 7 through an API. If you want to see what other games deal with, look at EvE Onlines infrastructure. They’ve published interesting use cases, and why they are locked to a region. 
---
When you replicate out, you need to do it synchronously and make that highly available immediately, and that is expensive which directly congruent with other replication algorithms. Blizzard’s stuff partially does run in Azure, at least for their US East servers hosted in Chicago (Azure DC). I’m sure they have other custom infrastructure, as the IP’s they have are actually associated with an AT&amp;T ASN.
---
Very good to know, thanks for the tip!
---
I'll see what I can do.  You can probably apply this at lower levels too.  Find an easy beast type mobs to fight efficiently and you should be good to go.  Mining, skinning, and herbalism are very strong gold at early levels too.
---
No, I haven't. I also dont care about them. Imagine that.
---
I thought warrior tanks had it bad, but pug tanking as a pally.... you must have the patience of a saint.
---
Simultaneously have seen many warlocks while out in the world and have had none in any of my dungeon groups. Can't a bro just get a summon every now and then?
---
Whether this is true or not, this is freaking hilarious! Ahh, cant wait to dive into Classic.
---
Plus I wasn’t complaining don’t ask me. Just stating the guy has a right to be pissed.
---
1% damage is 1% of all other classes, warlocks excluded.  1% more hunter damage is 0.8 - 0.5% due to pets not getting anything from your own stats.
---
That's awesome.

I think I just get a little over zealous. She's super into it when I'm not info dumping

Everybody downvoted who is now playing on a server that has already been put back up, while again Bigglesworth is left offline with im sure A WHOLE OTHER GROUP of servers **unable to let players in.** Hilarious what everyone is making fun of literally happens again for the 4th time today disproving those who think every server gets put up together or some servers aren't being especially targeted and kept down for longer.

---
&gt;Confused how telling a story is crying,
---
"Crying" goes so far back, it was a thing when Ultima Online was new. They mistake adult conversation, as "crying", because it's really hard for them to process points of view different from their own.  
---
The thing is with so many people playing a game, there's bound to be some assholes, jerks, sociopaths, etc mixed in the crowd. There's no real consequences for their lack of manners, so they spend their time going around finding places to leave comments like this.  
---
What's great about classic wow is that you're all stuck on the same server, and being shitty to other people actually can have a real cost on down the line that it normally doesn't have in the much bigger cross-realm population of retail.  
---
I mean, look at your profile here on reddit, compare it to his.

He clearly loves being "that guy", and recycling accounts so he can keep at it.

I used to have an addon that would give me a little timer when I cast healing spells, like if I cast renew it would pop up a little bar with the persons name and how long they had left on their renew, does anyone know what addon this is?

I'm relieved to be able to take my time and enjoy my game because min/maxing things and trying to be as efficient as possible would stress me out and take away the fun from games for me, but if that's what others find fun then I'm not gonna stop them. I don't want people to invalidate the way I enjoy wow, so I'm not gonna invalidate the way others enjoy it as long as they're not ruining the experience for anyone else
---
damn right it is, if they ever do a wrath classic i would play nothing else, imo best format for pvp gearing, best arena class balancing, ToC/ToGC, Uldar, ICC, better normal/heroic/mythic system, heirlooms kinda existed but werent just account-wide-account-infinite, they were an singular item you had to mail to your alt (also im pretty sure i deleted one of my characters that had an heirloom or two on it back then whoops)

because their beta cringey response warranted a share

don't get me wrong mate, by all means this is a total sh\*tpost

This, unless it's a big pack or you're all a particularly low level for the current dungeon chain pulling is fine. You just have to be smart about it.

People keep referring to the talent "Improved Frostbolt" as "bad." Or similar dismissive things.   
---
I *assume* due to the 1.5 GCD ceiling. But then you often see the same people go back up and grab 5/5 anyway even after calling it bad/useless. Can anyone explain this seeming contradiction? Is it bad or not?

This is hilarious coming from someone I regularly see on the eve online sub.

Lifedrain is actually quite good once you get some spellpower. I'm specced drain tank and I get almost twice as much health as I spend mana while doing 2.5x the dps of my wand. Add to that a succubus for dark pact battery and you've got infinite mana.

This is the reason BoE's (if they're like over 50g or more) are need rolls for the whole group. It just stops bullshit like this and honestly anyone who's played vanilla understands that gold is often more valuable anyways.
---
Half this fucking sub hasn't played pservers or understood how all this works and it fucking hurts to read shit like "oh this guy rolled on something that was an upgrade for me". You're rolling for gold, not the upgrade. You save gold if you win but otherwise you sell.

Form someone who does work a multimillion dollar network. You have no clue what your talking about. A high powered DDOS can push enough through put that it can crash internet back bones. At that point blizzard could literally invest a billion dollars a second to fixing it and get know where, because there ISP and there 1 gigabit connection are down do to the traffic flood. Worse for something like wow DDOS protection is hard because you can't distribute the service. You can do some stuff to try and obfuscate the service and stop non "wow" traffic with minimal overhead. But at the end of the day if someone throws a terabit of pipe at you your going down. Whether your Blizzard Amazon cloudflare or even a major ISP

Glad it worked, just be mindful the uninstalling/reinstalling of drivers through ddu is considered common maintenance as sadly this tends to happen often.

&gt;You're still assuming he wouldn't keep doing this if he wasn't getting the attention.
---
Taken from another comment I made to someone else:
---
&gt; Well, if you ever become a parent or pet owner, try to remember this: Children and animals will act out when they don't receive enough contact. As soon as you positively reinforce this behavior by giving them what they want, it becomes their default behavior whenever they feel deprived. That's why you introduce punishment for bad behavior to act as negative reinforcement and encourage more constructive behavior in the future. When this happens in a situation where you can't punish the individual in question, the only option is to ignore them and never give them what they're after. When they don't get the fix they're looking for, they simply move on and deal with reality. This is a well-studied topic in sociology and psychology, and I highly recommend you read up on this (It's an extremely important thing to know for parents!!). 
---
&gt; And why should anyone care about his ego when we know it's 99% guaranteed he'll be arrested and convicted for this? 
---
The answer to your question is literally half of the piece you quoted.

&gt; The attacks are still happening ... This person will keep this up for as long as they can

&gt; Wrong, they'll keep this up for as long as they can UNTIL they are arrested.

At this point I can't tell if you're just trolling me.

You can run a BotNet off of a VPN making it virtually impossible to track. It can be someone in Rhode Island with an IP of Russia. You can even have layered VPNs to send a flood of packets.

You are posting on this subreddit and aren't even lv60 yet. You are so mediocre even in the things you love that the idea that someone being better than u must mean they have no life when really theyre just more efficient than you
---
He was just asking a question, damn.
---
No there aren't mate, I think you've never played vanilla cause if you'd played any pserver you'd know that your logic would be laughed at.
---
Gold is literally far more important in vanilla than retail, it buys consumes, your mount, etc. It's been like this on pservers for years.
---
&gt;	Also they could easily use Nord VPN to hide their IP addresss so the ddoseres couldn’t find them. 
---
There are so many things wrong with this sentence I’m not even sure where to start. For one, the client still needs to know the destination address, so you’d be hiding something that millions of people already have and that anyone could download for free. Also, the outlet for the VPN can also be attacked. Plus adding additional steps adds latency, which isn’t ideal for an online game.
---
Don't worry, they're a gnome.
---
There’s nothing wrong with streaming imo. Yea it sucks when they get ahead because of their fame, but that’s just life in generally. Famous people will always be ahead.
---
Feral is viable throughout the game, falls off some in Naxx. Resto is always relevant in pve and PvP.
---
I plan to heal for 60 raids and slowly transition to spell damage gear with ZG and AQ 20, going for PvP as my main objective. 
---
29/11/11 is viable. Also 30/0/21. These are primarily for wpvp, which druids are S tier
---
Go ahead and act like an anonymous asshole if you want to, kid. This isn't retail.
---
I did it again and got it. Thanks though!

Lots of rogues and priest on thalnos/netherwind transfer. Would prolly put mages 3rd and then locks. Druids doing work as tanks though. Havent seen many warriors and hunters. Just based off dungeon running and questing up to Arathi so far.
---
I've had almost no bad experiences with them. I'm level 37 now and to this day, they always gave me free water, buffs and tried to get groups going for quest mobs.

World of warcraft came out 15 years ago and quite quickly became the most famous MMORPG game. However over the years the quality really diminished. Classic wow is a recreation of the first 2 years of world of warcraft, which is both very nostalgic since the gameplay is completely different from the other version, but it also restored a pretty damn good game. Other than that, it's a game that people have been begging blizzard to release for years, so it's very hyped.

If anything, the Tauren belong the least in the horde. Orcs are savage, undead are savage, and trolls are savage.

Now can I stop mine from censuring the chat
---
Hmm maybe. I do a lot of stupid shit
---
Probably because many older players like me feel regular wow is very bloated,dumbed down and not fun.
---
Go to stv, even with layering trying to do any of the hunt quests can take an hour or more, more people than there are spawns, can't imagine it without layering
---
Lol good luck with that. When a mob hits 20 percent it dies. Execute.
---
He's obnoxious as can be. I cannot watch his content. Have blocked it from my youtube completely.  
---
I'm not one to jump a bandwagon of hate but  I've yet to see any reason to like the guy. I'm not gonna troll his channel or tell ppl not to watch, they can if they want. I just won't ever.  He comes off as whiny, immature, and extremely self centered to me.  I hope there are other classic wow streamers and such, but I don't rly watch streamers. No real point.
---
Game came out in 2004, expansions have been added every few years to current retail WoW. A lot of people had a special nostalgic place in their heart for the 2004 version and have been asking Blizzard to recreate it for a very long time. It's everyone who wants to experience what they felt playing the game for the first time.

Lets say you love cs 1.5 but hate cs GO, this is basically cs 1.5 released again. And lots of people love wow like it was in the old days, thats why it exists :)
---
Definitely try it.
---
lmfao this is the best meme that has ever been posted on this sub well done sir I applaud you
---
The bigger the pull, the easier it is to tank as a warrior. Warrior tank, 3 mages and whatever healer can finish armory in ~8 minutes. For some reason, demoralizing shout generates more threat the more targets it hits, so pulling 20 mobs with mage slow and nova to smooth out damage allows you to easily tank huge pulls.
---
Hmm yeah that sounds good for short time windows and at right times but probably isn't very consistent or overall the best.  Still great to know though!
---
Isn’t she a high elf? Blood elves have fel green eyes.

He doesn’t have to mash execute on every mob

I play wow and work at a pizza place, I feel this post.

same :( this is quite a bummer.

thx. sounds pretty unusable tbh

Thought it was just my server. Was raiding Ashenvale and killing alliance and I thought one of them was fucking me over lol.
---
Nice try kid.

What is T_D?
---
wait till you realize its self only in this patch LOL
---
Blizzard doesn't have "GM's", they pretty much completely abandoned that in favor for automated system. Report for spam and ignore and move on.
---
you log in to a server and people are actually talking to each other and LFG in trade chat instead of a que and impersonal experience
---
Especially if you are a clothie
---
Ill upload a few days worth of data
---
This makes me sorta miss tbc in a way lol.  I remember when seal of blood was broken and fuck and you had like 5 guys gank you.
---
Just turned on some motley crew and prepared for a fuckin 1v5
---
To allow people freedom of choice and to not limit them from playing with their friends
---
Personally I think elemental is probably better, people talk up enhancement because of windfury crits but in terms of reliable damage ele is better IMO. Enhancement can get kited to death really easily since they're a melee with no gap closer and their damage output is heavily based on luck with windfury procs
---
Or just do whatever you want because it's a video game and the end goal is to have fun
---
What I do is bubble whenever possible and I start spamming heal until I run out of Mana. At this point just pray the dps is good enough to kill him fast.
---
If all your buddies play on a server and you buy a sub you will wanna be able to play with them
---
lol bruh that’s the most basic screenshot I’ve ever seen. 
---
Although I’ve always been drawn to simple graphics like Classic WoW, and in a way prefer them over the more real, hyper detailed, and overwhelming graphics of modern games. I think it’s my ADD brain getting a chance to actually soak up what I see instead of being overwhelmed by all the pretty shit in modern games. I can use my imagination easier and let it fill in the blanks when the graphics are simple.
---
Saw this post in /all damn ddosing happens here too, we suffered through that phase on OSRS, just wait till Christmas time hits kids gonna have super booters, rip servers.
---
And there are very reliable ways to get equipment. Its less fair and more greedy to expect since you can wear a plate belt, you should auto get it. It as always been like that.
---
Yea blizz pushed for that to be the headline etc. to induce a sense of fear in anyone who wants to do this stuff
---
Basically they made an example of them, or tired to.
---
Cause it is
---
Nobody is as equipped to tank as I retail, tanks are very poor at threat and have virtually no active mitigation or cooldowns in classic across the board.  Druids are actually pretty much the best threat generating tanks and the 2nd best overall behind warriors.  A druid main tanked an onyxia kill already so far.
---
Vanilla = before any expansions.
---
Most private servers used patch 1.12 because it is the most stable so that's what they used. 
---
It's ok to be wrong.
---
it is very satisfactory but then it turns up you turn in those in 28 different areas and then the follow up quests also send you some other areas. then your day is ruined by flying all day, and you cant ignore since they will stay in the log if you dont complete and occupy your 20 quest limit
---
If only there was a map with a name somewhere. Maybe in a corner.
---
Worked a treat.  Cheers bro.
---
That sounds right. But...
---
When I dismissed the spider, it immediately turned red and attacked me. I killed it. I have no way of interacting with any pet now. I can't summon/call it to do over.
---
I tried to do this and everyone called me mom
---
I have a character on classic wow named RuneScape and another  named zezima but yea they are basically maxed pures for the combat bracket.
---
Sweat. Where can I find those?
---
Same. Holy shit
---
Can't you just kick him before he needs?
---
Yep reason why layering ruins classic experience so much
---
Sweet, where can I find those?
---
As the population becomes higher level the prices will probably end up going down, no?
---
I mean the attacker literally said that they got so much publicity from fri/sat attack that they wanted to do it again, then linked reddit posts about reeeing and that was the sole reason they did it again.

????  Sounds like you really haven't decided what, YOU, want.
---
I started classic WoW with the intention of being a healer.  And that's exactly what I've done.  I'm level 32, and every single one of my talent points is in the Resto tree.  It's my goal/intention, to be main healer in Raids.
---
I don't, off-heal!.  I main heal.
---
I don't, off-tank, I'm the main healer.
---
Choose the job you want to do, and do that job.  Once you've done that, you'll find yourself enjoying the Druid class a lot more than you are now.
---
I think I've just gotten really unlucky in wpvp so far. If I come across any alliance they're either 6+ levels above the zone they're in, or they're surrounded by 3 other alliance all running together. I have died many times.
---
wtf, hes on felweed
---
New to classicwow - is there a point where I should be dungeoning instead of leveling, or does it not matter?
---
Crappost. 4 days ago Earthfurry was like 400 concurrent players Alliance and horde combined together. Now Horde alone is at 1k+ and it keeps growing as of time of this post.
---
I'm a 26 Human Warrior, the amount of times I have died is ridiculous, I don't know if I enjoy the class everytime an enemy parries or I miss I get so mad. I die to mobs my level or one level higher than me. Throughout my leveling experience I have been thinking about changing classes or biting the bullet and leveling up to 60 somehow. I have 2 days played on the character.
---
So do you guys think I should change classes if I find it so frustrating to level or does it get better and if you have any tips or something. It's my first time playing Vanilla.
---
Wow classic is trying to fix the mistake of distancing from the og playerbase. I dont want a good faith attempt to make us happy and get them money to be punished
---
That spam "go to retail". The irony being *they* are the shitty "need my dopamine fix now" retail players.
---
When I did these quests I had issues because I had the previous quests item on my action bar trying to tame the next. Had to switch them out but as thick as I am it took me almost 20 minutes to realize.
---
Shaman, the leveling isnt the worst and you can heal relatively well in the endgame. You can also play ele for PvP and Enhancement for farming.
---
I also made a nightelf druid because I just grew sick of the horde astetics after some time and need some actually good looking characters to look at. This way I can also decide whether I wanna play alliance or horde more. And can if I want to get a warrior on one of the sides.
---
(Using gold from the previous character to outfit him)
---
No, sharding is. Sharding is micro layers per zone and it fails to even populate those zones. Layering is the size of full Vanilla servers (3,000 players), which is a good idea so that the world design doesn't collapse having 1000 players in a single zone designed for like 50-100.
---
That ellipses is sus

If you can't change it, does it matter what you call it? I don't choose to take offense. That's all.

I’ve been skinning and just selling the leather to vendors. Also get an addon that shows the vendor price of items so you choose your quest rewards wisely. Also don’t train all your abilities, only the ones you need. I am a 39 shaman, 75 gold, I’ve just been doing this and it seems to be working well. I am a little off the needed 90g for a mount but I am confident I can get it by grinding mobs for leather for this last level!
---
Appreciate it
---
Here's the best advice you will ever hear. Reroll on horde.
---
I was standing around waiting for a escort npc to spawn. Someone shows up obviously waiting for the same one. I invite him to the group and he joins. 
---
Npc spawns, he goes up and drops group just before he accepted it. What the hell man? What was the point of that? Whatever.
---
I don't kill lowbies. No honor in that. I've played both sides, but yes, I prefer horde. What I'm getting at is yes, it's super annoying to get camped. It's rage inducing to get one shot when you're trying to quest. No one likes a raid making a whole zone off limits. But, for some people, world pvp is fun. Seeing dead NPCs in a contested zone, trying to figure out if it's a friendly questing or the guy that killed you earlier. Getting ganked at flight points then calling in help until you have a massive battle going that turns into a faction City raid. These things don't really exist in the current game anymore. That's why I'm here, for the excitement and the fun, and the frustration. That's what a pvp realm in old school wow meant, and you have option of a pve realm of you want.
---
It's by no means bad at all. Frostbolt at max rank has a 3 second cast time, so the imp frostbolt drops it to a 2.5s cast time which is well above the global cooldown window of 1.5s and since you can now cast more frostbolts per minute your dps is 100% going to increase against single target. It is a necessary talent for single target dps and just about every situation youll ever be in if youre planning to use frost spells.   
---
I'm not sure whos saying its bad, but a lot of the very focused AOE (area of effect) playstyle mages will likely not get it as theyre focusing all of their playstyle to round up a bunch of mobs and group them up and use aoe spells like bilzzard, frost nova, cone of cold, arcane explosion to kill them. Theyre solely focused on killing as many monsters as quick as possible for the sake of farming for experience or for gold. They can really only do it with melee mobs or in certain dungeons, so it has its niche spot but its very popular nowadays with how fast the xp can be. As stated before though, their dps will lack single target due to them specializing in aoe scenarios... hope that makes sense
---
Not a huge fan, but I don't have a stick up my butt about it...
---
I would think the big advantage is if you can MC a mob AND get it to hold aggro fighting another mob. (maybe while the rest of your team fights a third mob).  That takes the priest out of the occasion, but then aren't the two mobs fighting each other basically both on your team?
---
It's not uncommon for online games these days to have rough launches with how many people try to get in all at once. I'm not even defending blizzard, it's just wild to me that people get so upset over this happening and don't understand the technical limitations. You say that there's no excuse to have queues, which makes no sense, especially for an mmo where you absolutely need a limited number of players per realm. Logging into the game and having to compete with thousands of other players for quest mobs and mats doesn't sound very fun to me.
---
Ok ty!
---
Well it's mine, damnit!
---
It's the worst dad joke pun. I love it.
---
you'll likely find a way to build some hybrid page that does what you want, being a healer doesn't necessarily mean you have to be in restoration spec, sure having NS/SM and better/more-efficient heals is nice but its not necessary - you have all of the healing spells you need to heal (and more importantly, innervate) no matter what talent tree you dump points in to   
---
there used to be an old joke that the best warlock spec was 17/17/17 because it just didnt fucking matter lol

It terms of mana regen / endurance, how do priests and shamans compare?
---
I can get in on Whitemane as long as I log into something that isn't my main.
---
Had a rogue need roll and win a 2h sword of strength from me (warrior) on the first day of classic. Rogues are just dickhead selfish retards. I don’t roll with rogues.
---
It might be that the talent isn't optimal while leveling, but is good to grab at a higher level. People may choose to grab the talents Frost Warding and Elemental Precision first. Regardless, you should level in the way you want
---
After tanking Stocks today and explaining to my two NE hunters that they can’t Multishot the moment I pull because there’s no way I can dish that amount of threat out that quickly and them never stopping it and constantly getting attacked and panic kiting to me I’m inclined to agree
---
That sounds like a him issue. Maybe if he was more creative we could have been best friends?
---
Each zone has a general chat. You can talk to people that are playing in that zone and are likely to be around you're level. 
---
Just ask if anyone in there wants to do any quests with you. People will likely want to. You can chat to the people in general chat and your party and add them to your friends list to hit them up later too.
---
I just press shift and click.
---
That should have been in place a very long time ago.
---
I love this story so much hahaha that’s awesome
---
It's really afk money and good consumables. Basically you're gonna be farming for consumables or gold for raiding eventually, so might as well do something as afk as fishing
---
I switched to arms at 40, and overpowered is currently a nuke. I've deleted many mobs with it so far.
---
&gt; I replied that he must be fun at parties
---
While I agree with everything you say, I really hate this phrase.
---
Current wow: cutscenes and teleports. Never die
---
Classic wow: walk every inch. Die die die
---
I bet it was a gnome rogue...
---
Same. Can't get on my main but anything else, log in just fine.
---
up top brother
---
Two things: 
---
1. If you're playing WoW Classic for balance and fairness you are playing the wrong game.
---
2. That doesn't really make any sense, because if a cloth wearer could roll on the types of gear, they can't use it anyway, so why would you ever want to? If you're actually worried you have less options, roll a plate wearer!
---
How is late game mana managment for mage? Will I be able to cast more than 3 of my highest ranked spells without going oom?
---
Gallery of us 10 manning it. It was a breeze but we still had fun as a group lol.

Take your damned up vote and get out of here.
---
What time (with timezone) do you usually play?
---
I'm not sure which server you're on, but i feelt the opposite. The spirit has generally been good, but it's retail peeps that continue to bring their ways over.  
---
That said many has been nice and good. But oh boy do we've some toxic shits going on on our server.
---
Very much "every man for himself" kind of scenario. 
---
Heck today i helped a priest doing khan quest in desolace, as he were nearly dying. Just because he went headrush in to tag him once he saw i was in the area. So once i saw him dying i rushed in to cc and help out. He then proceeds with a nice "f off" and leaves the area. 
---
I'm standing there confused.. as i was just farming the area but purposly left the quest mob (khan) for anyone who happen to go in and need it. 
---
But ye he almost died to wanting the tag so bad, i help him, and get told to f off. 
---
But that's just one of many. But then again we've many nice peeps too. 
---
There's always gonna be some bad apples among the bunch.
---
Oh shit ur mains zezima? And yea it’s fun af I’m lvl 26 taking it slow on the way
---
Thanks. But I removed the item from my action bar (though I think I tried once or twice before realizing).
---
Even after I remove the item from the action bar. Delete it from my inventory. Abandon the quest. Log out. Log back in. Retake pick up the quest. Still no good.
---
I wasn't able to log in even to alts, but I was in WC when the server went down and died so that might have something to do with it
---
Hunters can do everything well, are fun and are the most versatile class!
---
Yes, theres an issue where it's anchored to other frames with a fresh install.
---
Go to the party frame options switch the anchor position
---
Does blizzard normally refund (as in extend game time) for situations like this? 
---
Just came back after MoP and im constantly disconnecting 51900319 and now its been ddosed for two full days. Not really bitching just asking as im not familiar with blizzards workings.
---
Because that'd kill their game and they don't want to kill the game
---
I couldn’t do Redridge elites for this precise issue.
---
mate the same argument could be applied to someone vendoring the eye of rag, no one technically loses anything by letting someone vendor it just like the warrior loses nothing from not getting the item. Every BoE blue and even two epics ive seen drop so far everyone has needed on them without anything needed to be said and the group congratulated whoever won it weather it would have been an upgrade for them or not, i saw an ardent custodian drop as a 41 tank and didnt even consider trying to force my group to pass on that so i could steal it to use myself
---
if someone tried insisting they deserved a valuable BoE more than anyone else did i would consider that extremely bm
---
Just started playing again. Was wondering if there are any servers to avoid on EU because of streamers or high level of gankers (not sure how you'd figure that out)?
---
That requires the group leader to see the name in chat. Another party member can't tell you to invite them, because they can't type the name.
---
Quartz is great for a priest. I use it on my priest
---
Somewhere, some dude is gonna get a Pendulum of Doom and vendor it and feel okay about his decision.
---
In addition to using all ranks of holy light, don't forget about blessing of protection or hammer of justice. Make sure you are using both to help protect the group. Also, try to bring some mana pots if you can for those oh sh*t moments.
---
if you manage threat properly then it doesnt matter if youre 25% or 90%. i still bandage/cannabilize to help but all the healer doing by not healing is making the run longer for everyone
---
Damn, better than me, I got it in 7
---
Sulfuras is having the same issue. Horde are easily 7:1 right now. Three of my guildies went back to retail because it's impossible to quest. If you didn't roll horde on a pvp realm you basically fucked yourself.
---
Who was that guy who got jail time and started balling when he sentenced?
---
I got the impression that he understood that the bulk of the content was coming later, but that he was reporting on what is actually there and available currently.
---
It's a mocking/joke stick, but okay.
---
I think that's a bit of a stretch...... I'd say given the fact that twinking wont be a thing until Phase 3 when the first battlegrounds come out, it will give the market time to settle in and lots of ore to be available and you can pick and choose buying mats when appropriately priced you could do it 10-15 max
---
definitely a little weird as i dont remember seeing alt-code names at all until at least wrath, but all in all it doesn't make a difference to me
---
They’ll deserve it later
---
Since there's no situation where I'd have to type the person's name, I literally couldn't care any less.
---
Absolutely not. I'm pretty sure it's just a more intuitive /who.
---
I see warlocks and mages roughly the same number. Then hunter, priest, rogue, warrior, shaman
---
Seen a lot of warriors early on but not a lot now around level 30. Though I dont often see rogues either outside of dungeons. But i guess it is because of invisibility.
---
Yeah :) Got around 100 now, but still remember that first golden boy :P
---
Each layer has roughly the same number of people as an entire vanilla server, so if 15 years ago you would have 10 people in Feralas, now you have 40 but split across 4 layers.
---
Can second this I got to lvl 60 on my warrior in about 6 days played :) and two boes

This is hard to look at

 Most of them are from China,   yall have been spoofed
---
What addon is that where it has your item rarities highlighted?
---
That's why I picked NE. Fear ward? Nah. MC into lava is where it's at.
---
Chronometer
---
As a DPS, I agree with this. I have accidentally pulled mobs before because of poor aggro management by me. 
---
But then the hunter next to me does the same and flames the tank.
---
Hunters are assholes, change my mind.
---
It does not work on classic, it's been tested and confirmed.
---
Warlocks are just awesome to have in dungeons. I take a warlock over a mage any day. And these two over basically any other DD.  Except when I have the two of them already, then I like having a rogue as well.
---
oh yeah that solves everything, lets just group up as 5 people so that we can loot 25 necklaces... oh wait its 125 now...  
---
grouping does not solve the time issues, if anything it makes it worse

Already did. Learn how to use the print screen button you fucking peasant

Level 30 alliance rogue looking for a good place to quest other than stv. I’ll also consider grinding.
---
Yeah wtf is up with that... my main is my only toon I cant log into lol
---
Can't log into any character on Kalimdor on Whitemane, but I can make an Undead and log-in to Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Same exact thing happened to me. I had an almost breaking bad moment in wailing caverns - was helping my friend tame one of the monsters there and was generally waving and dancing with the horde going into the instance and having a good time. Plenty of people were flagged for pvp but I left them alone, until lo and behold a mage 10 levels higher murders me and my friend in cold blood then goes into the instance. Well something snapped and I was like fuck this every horde I see now dies. Was absolute carnage, any horde flagged got sapped while I cheap shot stunlocked their friend and killed their whole group as they tried to save them over and over. I was the entry boss to get into WC for anyone that was flagged for a good 30 minutes, slaying dozens of innocents all because one mage thought it would be a good idea to randomly kill me. All of their deaths are on your conscience and I can sleep blame free.

or he can just go to russia and get away with it...

Preciate it man yea I was thinking about that

Hunter. Something so satisfying about having an animal companion to explore the world with since I don’t have friends. Also hunter is one of the few classes who actually wear their tier sets as BiS items so if I ever get to raid I’d love to rock a matching set.

We wiped a few times doing the stonewatch tower elite quests in Redridge and I remembered that vanilla can be a little difficult.

Situation has to be really, really bad for $ compensation

Yup I refuse to interact with people that have the stupid characters unless I have to like their in guild or something. Absolutely hate it.
---
Some people post items on the auction below the vendor value. You can scroll screw weapons since they are the most common and make some gold pretty easily.
---
Basically it's a way for Blizzard to fit more people into a server. A single server will have layers so that you won't always see everyone who's there. This is a measure against over crowding. Each layer has its own mind and respawn timers so layering can theoretically be exploited to farm mobs quick. However it's harder to exploit layering than it is to exploit it's siblings, phasing and sharding.
---
if u were not a tank u would have been kicked
---
Try using the spell from ur spell book check the beasts lvl it needs to be ur lvl or lower
---
Lower failure rate. There's still a chance to fail at gathering even at 300.
---
THANK GOD, THE FBI. DEF DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM GETTING AWAY NOW

How is that the reason people choose their class currently? Are you saying that people that roll need on a boe and don't equip it after claiming it's for them or for their class and AHing it later are in the right because their class can use it at the moment they have some privilege to it potentially?
---
Totally unrelated to this issue.

I thought they did find them? Someone posted there fb page and area location last nite.

And if I go to a movie and the power goes out, I get my money back and it costs the theater company money as well as labor from the utilities to get it back on.

Thanks everyone! Great to hear that I can go DPS first.
---
Once you get into dungeons, never soul stone yourself if there is someone that can Resurrect the whole party from a wipe like paladin, priest or shaman. Always remember to use a soul stone on one of them, it’s a life saver.
---
I would but.. It's full of special characters and I forgot the Alt codes.
---
I’m also confused because I didn’t know this existed. If so, where do you get it?
---
Hate them. But then I see vulgar names like KiddiFiddler and realise it's hardly a big deal.
---
For fishing I don’t remember but for skinning there is a boss in Upper Blackrock Spire (The Beast) that if you have 305 skinning you can skin and get a chance for a drop.  I don’t recall the drop either.  Someone will come along with the full details.
---
Im pretty sure it is a layer. Whole continent is down for plenty of others who can also get into EK and not Kalim. They already stated before layers are continent wide right?
---
No changes.  What makes classic, classic, is that it’s perfectly imperfect.

That’s both the funny and sad part. Modern mmos add so many features that are supposed to make it easier to build a community. It is rare for a decent one to develop though. A lot of it is just that there is a completely different group of people playing these games nowadays. Only reason classic is able to even have the feel of those community’s is the old crowd coming back plus the nostalgia glasses keeping many others in check. I hope it lasts. But I’m not so sure it can.

Just what I thought, a coward.

Sometimes the ending quests in an area will lead you to the next one, sometimes they wont. as other have said, i recommend looking up a guide to at least see "generally" where people your level are questing or look for one of the maps that has level ranges associated with it. having a quest addon like questie can help you know where in a new zone you should go to find the quests as theyre marked on a map
---
Are you mage, maybe he wanted some water
---
Had a guild in Wrath that didn't allow members to have spacial chars in their names lol. And we were top 3 on the server so people would actually do paid name change to join us.
---
I see.
---
But would DPS warrior be invited to raids to get PVP gear?
---
Same here but last 2205. Time traveler on that classic retro remake reboot yo.  There still isn’t a wow killer
---
I’m not understanding
---
Oh no!
---
This is much, much bigger than just WoW.
---
Because the classes are unbalanced and some are much better than others. You're acting like there is no advantages in this game and it's perfectly balanced, and something that isn't 100% balanced would ruin the game.
---
I mean, did you see the original post? It was a rogue taking plate, this is 100% related to the matter. It would fix this issue entirely.
---
There is nothing more satisfying than watching somebody die to a mob they stole from you
---
Walt WHAT ?! Link?
---
See you tonight if you’re still in hillsbrad by 12am server time. Meet Me in front of the yeti cave at midnight. I will slay every horde there.
---
Yeah it isn't perfect, but you can take some damage off at least.  And at 37/38/39 gets better if you pick up imp. HS.
---
For fishing so you can fish up the ZG boss when it comes out.
---
Sounds like a nameplate sort of thing, or casting bar?
---
Also Codex has a better quest tracking than Questie. Codex is a must have addon
---
Warrior. He don't want what water I got.
---
horde is da poop
---
It should appear in the window to the right on bottom of screen.  If you cannot see the second window use "/reload UI".  If this is a continued problem you will need to update your add-on as it's likely out of date.

It's not good to bubble the tank; you should really only do it in emergency situations when they're on the verge of death.  It greatly reduces their ability to generate rage.
---
&gt;/run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", "6e1")

didn't work for me either, at first, then i reset my cvars completely and ran the one OP posted about and this one. don't know which one caused it to work, but i'm happy =p

Makes sense in LVL 25 night elf Hunter I've got almost 11 gold never touched the AH
---
He is hitting specific streamers to get reaction out
---
Bc it literally isn’t  faster than pressing one button.

It's kinda why I made a warlock. I can literally drag these morons to the dungeon and get us rolling.
---
nvm i figured it out, was the macros i was using. fixed it :)

but more fun.
---
It's the class I play on retail and have played for the better part of 10 years.
---
Will the name `Nickmyluts` get changed by Blizzard if I report it?
---
Oh and.. How do you mail someone with special chars if you dont know every Alt-code? Hmm? How you mail someone? So you think okay ill add them to friends list. Oh wait! Their name isnt in my chart anymore so I cant shift click them into friends. Okay, I'll google every alt code and tab in and out of WoW checking the code list so I can type their fucking name! FUCK YOU
---
It would make sense for them to do this sort of thing. The bubble stops physical entry and this spatial fuckery stops magical entry.
---
ebonics ?
---
Sadly this is the way it is Just be happy you aren't grinding Black lotus flowers thats gonna be hell
---
Rogues poison damage is static and doesn't scale at 60. Eviscerate has very poor scaling. Heroic strike is static damage and doesn't scale at 60. Execute is static damage and doesn't scale at 60.  
---
  
---
Pet is only a small part of marks hunter dps. So yeah, there's nothing really particularly special about hunters.
---
Clearly you've never heard of Edward Snowden.

For real lol, why do people who say this shit totally ignore there are governments out there that'll gladly harbor fugitives if it gets under the skin of a hostile country.

It literally isn't
---
YouTube it and thank me later
---
Paladin is a great class. Lots of fun!
---
The biggest factor in choosing a spec is deciding how much dungeoning you want to do. If you are solo, and want to join pugs to do dungeons, then consider spec'ing so you can tank. You can heal while leveling with any spec. Just get +healing and +int gear.
---
If you want to dungeon a lot while leveling, then spec as a tank so you can have that option. It will help you form groups faster as you can then perform any role the group needs. Usually finding a tank takes the longest.
---
If you don't feel like tanking, then spec ret. It gives you skills to help you kill mobs faster, like reduced judgement cooldown, +5% crit, SoC (assuming you have a slow 2H) and so on. However, note if you go prot then you will be able to better handle situations with multiple mobs. You can also do some AoE farming. Ret won't be great for that, and you therefore will have to be careful about not picking too big of a fight.
---
Personally, I love the flexibility of spec'ing consecrate + deep prot for leveling. The cookie cutter is to go ret.
---
I haven't been able to log onto ashkandi all night
---
Little Red Riding Hulk
---
fishing requires higher than 300 to eliminate fishes getting away in high level areas.
---
I like how each faction thinks it’s exclusive to the other.
---
Could just be that one of the world servers is down, Kalimdor had been down for a little bit on Whitemane but Eastern Kingdoms was fine
---
Yeah it's most likely your fault.  Dps usually put the blame on the tank but early level tank in classic have so few tools to maintain aggro you gotta do your share by watching what you do
---
I want to make a horde toon but all my friends and I play alliance
---
During the quest chain, you dismiss the pet to disown it, and it'll attack you.
---
It's not until you get complete the chain that dismiss simply despawns, and where Abandon is how you actually get rid of it.
---
It is indeed generally not that clear, but that's how it was designed to work.
---
I tried that for a bit. Went back to the hot keys. In the long run, the hot keys worked out a lot better. But it was a little rough for quite a while.
---
You have 1 button that does the entire screenshot and up load process?
---
And EQ I think used one of the dev's D&amp;D campaign worlds
---
Your a good drawer.
---
Now to just delete the class altogether and we’re good.
---
Being dumb is a permanent debuff. Don't try to heal through it lads.
---
Quality post lmao. Ret is way too OP for fishing. They need to nerf.
---
You’re my favorite reddit comment lol
---
Aoe only works 55+ and it’s a very very niche build with holy nova spam. So single target or dotting 2-3 mobs
---
&gt; It's not a big deal to merge servers down the track.
---
Yes it is, it completely ruins the vanilla wow community and is why retail community is the way it is. Go back to BFA.
---
Hunters get 3 weapon updgrades throughout all of raiding. Rhok'delar -&gt; Xbow of Smiting -&gt; Nerubian Slavemaker from KT. That's it.

Jog on troll, it’s all War/Rog on leaderboards
---
As a priest who tried to dps WC, how do you not pull aggro?! I was just using SW:P, wanding and using fade on cooldown and still pulled aggro.
---
People cycle in/out of cities for various reasons and there's going to be hundreds spread across each capital

---
I had completely forgotten that Rexxar pats around Desolace. He was such a welcomed face when I ran into him.
---
Good tip, thanks. I did find myself chaining heals a few times, but I felt it was necessary to keep our tank alive. He was also 5 levels above me, so even my top rank heal was only doing about 1/5 or so of his health. Once he had a good group of mobs on him, it didn't feel like i had any other recourse but to dump health into him.
---
There is no such thing as PvP gear in classic. Raid gear is the best gear for all purposes.  
---
The game has already been cleared by a party consisting of half the players under level 60, wearing dungeon blues and random greens. This proves that pretty much everything is viable. A PvP spec warrior will not outdo a PvE spec warrior, but they are both sufficient for clearing the content in the game.
---
There's literally no issue with a Paladin rolling on +Int or +Spr gear, they have to make their healing set somehow. 
---
Same for Deeps/Tanking gear, but that's generally less controversial.
---
You'll feel the full might of the Horde tonight &amp; be too afraid to walk out of southshore ever again after I'm done with you. Spit on me when you see me so I know its you

I was pretty shocked to see them so prevalent in Classic. It's like vertical videos, it's never going away. There will always be idiots out there.
---
maybe for NPCs but dishonor kills for Grey PC's makes perfect sense from an anti-griefing standpoint
---
Because there's still a chance I can win. And if I die i'll spawn back.
---
How do U get up there?
---
Mage because I play boomy on retail and they are trash in classic.
---
I’m okay with getting ganked. But getting CAMPED by people 8+ levels above me? Ridiculous.
---
slow falling is even better
---
i agree to a point. some dickheads fucked me over and were like "welcome to classic :)" but these people are fairly uncommon. they were acting like ppl like themselves were the norm but im very glad that they aren't.
---
Rogues and warriors are the top DPS classes by a fairly healthy margin. You’re seeing a lot of mages because they’re a quick levelling class.
---
you pick up sorc there and cas blizzard with spellcleave group, or pick wizzard and obliterate big pulls with arcane exploasion
---
I only meant that the FBI is what catches them. It's a federal crime. Not quite sure what people are expecting to happen
---
They did at launch when they were having major server problems, but they haven’t since, and certainly haven’t for things that were outside of their control, like a DDOS attack.
---
Post it because the odds on that are 0.00000001%

What's it like not having eyesight?
---
Its purpose is to help server stability, not "bothered when questing".
---
Cata heroic dungeons were initially close to classic-level difficulty, then people cried and bliz caved and ... here we are ... with normal being basically soloable, heroics being faceroll, and needing to get up to 10+ mythic to be challenged
---
Once I am in a contested zone I am stealth 90% of the time
---
So you fight players 10+ levels up every time no questions asked?
---
The server is full on the server list, but I'm stuck on "Logging in to game server." I just want to take my WW axe out for a spin, damnit!
---
Priests are capable of aoe farming lashers in Dire Maul. Look it up. You can make tons of gold this way apparently.
---
What is layering and how is it getting abused?
---
No you couldn’t. I understand it’s fun to call someone a script kiddie because he’s doing it but if this was true it’d be more common. The guy might seem dumb on twitter but he knows what he’s doing and he won’t be caught like so many people assume so. Don’t be silly.
---
God dammit, Deagos.
---
You can just not do it at once. Whenever you are in an oasis for another quest just kill a couple on the way through. I ended up finishing all the other quests and only had to farm a handful more
---
As a pally I literally love swooping in buffing taking aggro if the mobs to much I yell RUNNN!!!! I’m all good cause of pursuit of justice HoJ divine spirit and lay of hands. Oh man it’s great, I heal them after and run away towards the light
---
"Pet off aggressive pls"
---
2 minutes later half of the sm armory is in the middle of our party.
---
What's it like being so mad getting ganked that you feel the need to cry about it on Reddit?
---
Mage is the obvious winner. Healers love the water, tanks the sheep, and you've got aoe utility every group needs.
---
Yes, and this happens to my girlfriend A LOT. It wasn't a big problem before but it has gotten worse to the point that ~60% of all kills are un-lootable. This is kinda game breaking because quests take twice as long to complete and we can't skin half of what we kill.
---
&gt; SECOND TO NONE, A MARINE AND A GUN
---
KILL, FIGHT, DIE, THAT'S WHAT A WARRIOR SHOULD DO!
---
(This whole song could be attributed to Chestnutz and picture)
---
Obviously it depends but if they're a warrior or something and fighting a mob I usually do. I've killed them a couple times.
---
god this is so gay...
---
get used to it we were top 3 dmg entire classic
---
A lot of anger, and a personal attack. Add on false information on top of that, you are a fun sounding person.
---
Fish and chips sound pretty good though 😩

I just don't get it.  I played an alt warrior in retail to 44 ish.  I don't recall it ever being a rough time.  I didn't even really twink him out either.  Just bought greens at the early levels to help out the at the rough spots.   Just gotta be smart and bandage.  Pots help too.   The server I play on is super short on tanks, so I've been mulling pulling the 'ol warrior out of retirement.   Really had the urge to heal this time around, but I also like filling needs with critical short classes.

In 2005, my 14 year old self randomly generated a name for my human paladin called "Grassaber." I thought it was a reaally cool name until one day someone referred to me in a Scholomance run as "assgrabber." 
---
So, I queried my guild, and they all though I had intentionally named myself as an anagram of assgrabber but were too polite to say anything about it.
---
Seriously F1-F5 must be the best possible way to heal after mouseover raid frames ui.
---
Keep RPing a scary dude on a game dad
---
Ok thank you. This is all so confusing to me, as I don't really know how to become a feral druid. Like in retail wow, you literally click a button and boom  you're a feral druid, but here I have to get specific talents and stuff right?
---
Yo, are you on kirtonos? I bought a sentry cloak last night for ~12s.
---
I'm saying that in an incredibly empty zone like Feralas that doesn't really get a lot of people, nor is the staggering majority of players reached that level bracket yet, the reason it feels so empty is because of that, not because of layering. Last night I was in Hinterlands and it felt empty too, but I /who'd and it showed only 3 people total in the zone
---
Nobody is crying here. So you're blind and you can't read.

Because they were on a break

why are you getting pissy at everyone in the replies then

I know this guy is a tedious troll but I hate it. They're hard to put on ignore. People who ninja with special characters can't be ignored unless they type or msg in chat. So if someone you trust mentions its best to avoid grouping with them it can be tough.
---
Good move. Use the hunter to farm gold so you can bling a priest out with twink gear and spell power enchants if you decide to go back.
---
No point in playing something you’re not having fun with!
---
Find a mage to play with on your Priest, the AOE grinding pulls can be massive with a priest/mage combo.

Devi*ant* Delight at its finest.
---
Every healer on alliance gets an oh shit heal as their first class spell I think. My priest got Desperate Prayer.
---
What portion of SM?
---
Right now Mage and Warlock are no1 priority since people are just mass aoeing every instance. (Spell cleave) I've seen team of 3 mage, 1 warlock and 1 priest tearing through dungeon.
---
Another variation of the meta is Melee cleave and you get 3 warrior, a shaman and a priest.
---
Hunter are more of a solo questing class cause they bring average dps, no buff and are self reliable.  
---
In the end, play a class you enjoy
---
So people can play with their friends. I only play horde because that’s what I like. And all of my friends play horde. 
---
And if you want to say “well just play on a different server”, let’s imagine this scenario. I have 5 other friends that play horde so that plus myself makes 6. EVERY other server only has somewhere between 1-5 horde spots left because for some reason, every realm is at a high-full capacity constantly. Now either 1-5 people HAVE to play alliance (and maybe they REALLY hate alliance for one reason or another I.e. don’t like their story or like the race models or whatever) and the others play horde. Now people, who are paying to play this game, are being forced to play what they don’t like. 
---
There are 2 options. 1. Get over it and play the damn game, even if you’re not having fun. Or 2. End your sub meaning blizz doesn’t make money from you. Player doesn’t like option 1 and blizz doesn’t like option 2 - both for obvious reasons. 
---
Now, while the chances of this happening are impossible to none (as I said, worst case scenario), this is basically why there aren’t faction caps. At least that’s what I imagine it to be. I personally wouldn’t play if I was locked to one faction. Now, if the class I want play is only on one faction (I.e. shaman/paladin), that sucks. But I’m sure I can find something else to play because I at least get to play with ALL my friends.
---
You're missing the point.  Lawbringer has strength which is literally useless for healer. The point is that there is much better healing gear you can wear instead of Tier 1.
---
I had to drop the settings and the render resolution so I can play smoothly on my 2015 13” MacBook Pro. No dedicated graphics sucks. 
---
I’ll be back in the main rig later tonight though thank fuck
---
Wow. This is why you kill everyone. Every single horde kills me every single time no matter how many /waves. You are all dead now I’ve had too many corpse runs I don’t care what level you are. Burn in hell.
---
I've never been more excited
---
Daaahhhhhhhhhhh Yenni Chen crying and mad daahhhhhhh
---
Why not both?!
---
I have 125g I can afford 5 stacks of 45 tier water. The servers havent had any issue since launch day and day after, and my server was confirmed attacked. If I plan on playing the next 10+ hours its a helluva deal not having to deal with it, and I obviously couldn't predict the circumstances. 1g isnt that bad, it was the free time lost that hurts.
---
Same.
---
It's good at 60 right now but I imagine it's going to get worse as the shit players start getting here
---
Shes in the cow level
---
Die.
---
I assume the just autohit?
---
Notice you don’t see any alliance players complaining about pvp on pvp servers even though Horde do the same fucking thing? Does Horde just attract salty virgins or am I missing something?
---
Yes, it is
---
Sure, but you have to prioritize.  If you waste all your mana keeping the dps up and the tank goes down, probably everyone dies.  If the dps know how to handle their threat, either by kiting or stunning or evading, whatever, thats damage I can heal.  But if they just face tank ... its dumb to try and keep them alive.
---
You crying right now boi
---
Rock duh lar . Idk how to spell it either
---
Edit rhok’delar
---
Personal attack like calling me a tard who knows nothing and wouldn't be doing anything "anyways?" Your words not mine there skippy.
---
It was against ToS they became a lot more lax on it around wotlk
---
I have microfreezes when loot is being rolled and didn't realize it was Prat
---
You didn't want boring... So standing around auto shooting waiting for arcane shot and aimed is better?
---
Wants to farm gold. Good because you'll spend A METRIC FUCK TON on arrows and pet food.
---
Yea, cause it’s more of a Cold War following the events of WC3, right?
---
Why are Horde players such virgins?
---
Bravo, I raise a mug to you....
---
Either route you go, Classic+ or TBC, the gap in gear and power will continue to grow. I do not think this is a particularly useful thing to combat.
---
Anybody want it click here u/FlorenceLogan5
---
I quest until my bags are full of mats then AH everything.
---
I think the best pvp experience I’ve ever had in gaming was mind controlling alliance on their way to molten core or bel into the lava of black rock mountain.
---
Sounds like something you should submit a ticket about?
---
omg still laughing :)))))
---
It's actually pretty epic.
---
No one compares to warrior in mitigation but demo shout cant compare to swipe

That's what I tell the locks in my groups.  They are replacing their mana with mine.

Yes, WoW started being developed in 1999 if I’m not mistaken, WC3 got released in 2002, TFT in 2003. Takes a bit of time to develop a game like WoW.
---
If you are an auctioneer in classic why don't you have a screenshot of classic items being sold?
---
Only one person can loot a corpse, even on free loot. It shouldn't sparkle for the other person so thats a but buttt you both wont be able to loot the same mob either way
---
Yeah killing multiples creates more downtime so it's basically slower
---
Priest &amp; Warlock = emo kid and the suicide hotliner with a bad day
---
As someone with a job and basic human empathy, I feel for them. It sucks having to cancel plans or lose sleep because shit blew up at work, no matter how well compensated you are for it.
---
Same here with Skeram, been getting [this](https://imgur.com/a/ZniRFe7) error all night.

---
I too noticed this and you are unable to skin the creature killed
---
Meanwhile my warrior is still level 23 and I have no motivation to keep playing Classic
---
That paragraph you quoted applies to children and pets... The guy(s) behind this attack are beyond the early ages of cognitive development and that comes with the expectation that they should already have better behavior ingrained, since they clearly do not it's highly doubtful they'll change from the general public's reaction, whether it be attention or lack of thereof. That's when the law steps in and reprimands these people.
---
&gt; At this point I can't tell if you're just trolling me.
---
Same, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
I found this is common when loot is set to ffa even happens when a mob should drop an item 100% all you can do is report it to Blizz.
---
Yepp, even happens to me when soloing sometimes. Mob keeps being shown as lootable, but he's not. 
---
I think it's a bug with empty mobs (which is a thing) but doesn't get cleared after looting. Probably related to autolooting. 
---
You can produce same thing as a rogue aswell if you pickpocket but then attack at the same time, then you get to loot twice (normal loot + pickpocket) However the corpse will stay "lootable" but empty. So you can't skin it. Very annoying.
---
Had something happen a few years ago over Christmas. I was 2,000 miles from family, roommates were away for the holiday, and all I wanted to do was play some online PS4, but someone DDoS'd the PSN and it was down for two days.

Why is it always the hunters that are douches
---
This screenshot shows perfectly what the Horde and Alliance are all about. I'm so glad I chose Alliance
---
Goldshire inn i  guess

Grats!

Cool, one week worth of reporting everyone! Sounds like a new game mode
---
Thanks dude, I won't &lt;3

The classic community is being RUINED by CHILDREN and RETAIL PLAYERS, with the help of BLIZZARD THEMSELVES to DESTROY CLASSIC WOW FOREVER

It's a bit boring but grinding beasts in desolace can get you a ton of gold while levelling to 40. On Friday I was level 35 with 35g, now at 100 gold LVL 39 2 days later. Ive just been grinding mobs with a little bit of SM spam.

Looks like the average Horde player

You either need to stop taking the drugs that you're on or start taking the right ones.
---
Layering is basically multiple layer of the same server on one server.  It's like a lasagna.  Each layer are part of one big lasagna but the ingredient doesn't really touched itself.
---
People abuse it because every layer have his own monster, mining veines, chest and others.  People can clear an area, layer hop to a layer where all the monster are up and clear it. You avoid the respawning time.  Same for mining veines... you mine..  layer hop and boom the same vein you just mined appear cause on that layer it was there
---
Yes both
---
I understand that times get hard, and even $15 is hard to justify (story of my life). Maybe you have better uses for that money, or you'd just rather save it. You just need to focus on your priorities. If you are happy with your job, and can afford your bills, no need to go out looking for a new job, just to play a game. However, if the thought of not being able to play the game irks you, go through all your expenses, and see what you can cut. If you still can't swing it, maybe treat yourself to a month of game time every once in awhile.
---
That's right! I'm glad there are more ways for us to mistreat each other, because it makes it more special when we don't.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. You didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Healing for me is interesting, not because of how many different healing  spells I have, but the moment to moment gameplay. It can either be relaxing (maybe boring, depending on how you see it) if everything runs smoothly or every couple seconds the battle makes it so that you have to quickly adapt to the new (health) situation of the group and come up with a plan to save everyone on the spot.  
---
That's why I love healing.  
---
Playing DPS in a dungeon or raid just feels boring to me. You just stand there (making sure there's no fire below you) repeating your (most optimal) dps rotation. Every fight is essentially the same - you hit stuff until it dies. Works the same every single time. There's no variation.
---
Ashenvale is by far the worst map in this game...

You’ve watched too much Mr Robot if you think you can run a bot net off a vpn and avoid getting caught. Unless you’re supported by a state actor, if a government agency wants to find your dumb ass for launching a DDoS, they’ll find your dumb ass.

If that's the case, if it's the internet backbones that were attacked, not the actual blizzard servers, then I don't really see what else blizzard can do. Sure they can hire another company, but there's only so many companies that provide the internet and network solutions for a system as big as blizzard runs yeah?
---
&gt; I mean it can't be that hard to figure out who shelled out a pretty penny to a bot farm
---
Guaranteed they used cryptocurrency, probably monero
---
Eh, it was way before Icerowne. Unless there was a huge gear disparity, threat was never a problem, with the exceptions of Hodir Hard Mode, and Lady Deathwhisper.
---
Even if there was a threat disparity, tricks and MD were so powerful in Wrath. Tanks practically didnt even need to go pick up adds.
---
Or if you were a DK tank and an add spawned, and you had no runes up.
---
Spent about an hour yesterday trying to kill a rare dragon in Alterac. Started with 2 rogues and ended up needing about 7 to kill it. Didnt get any rewards, even missed out on the xp because my evasion tanking didnt go so well. Still one of the most memorable experiences I have had in WoW.
---
Let people enjoy what they enjoy.
---
back in vanilla alliance was known for ganging up on horde because the server was like 55/45 or 60/40 in their favor, horde often let others get ganked and didnt assist. Almost all 1v1s resulted in horde victories that i saw, it was 2004 and a lot of the much older/younger crowd picked the pretty heroic looking faction, i never encountered someone over 20 until i had an alliance toon in TBC the guild had couples in their 40's. might seem anecdotal but stormreaver US was famous for the alliance shitters and the uphill battle horde had against the alliance, instant pvp que times for horde at most times, 1 hour wait for alliance, being outnumbered was awesome.
---
Ddos’d
---
&gt; there’s no way I can dish that amount of threat out that quickly
---
Was them not knowing this frequently an issue the first time around in vanilla as well, or this a new problem as a result of the effect of people being complacent because they are used to how threat works in retail?
---
I'll give you one big tip: don't use heroic strike unless you have 50+ rage. You might think it's only 15 rage, but it also won't generate any rage from what would have been the white attack, so it's effective cost is 22-25 rage. Just tab-target while spamming sunders and start with a demo shout.
---
There's a meme template in here somewhere
---
Going to TBC is a death sentence because they'll just have to repeat the mistakes they made as they pushed out more expansions. 
---
I think classic+ is the smart move for them once current classic runs its course
---
As someone who has and still is currently playing both alliance and horde.  I can tell you my little checker board shows ally ganking at about 2x the rate of horde.  Which I find hysterical as there are far more posts about ally being handled here.  My only explanation is that maybe a certain type of personality play it exclusively this resulting in this.
---
Either way, here are my numbers with roughly 10 hours of difference between time played in each faction, I have only recorded the ?? ganks though.  Also, the 10 hours play time favors the alliance not the horde, damn guildies from old didn't want to change it up.  Though I won't lie, I'm really enjoying horde on Stalagg.   Herod alliance people seem quite toxic compared, no clue about the Herod horde and Stalagg alliance though.
---
[Herod] Alliance lvl41 = 6 times (ganked by horde by ??)
---
[Stalagg] Horde lvl39= 14 times (ganked by alliance ??)
---
This is only recording the last 5-6 days as it didn't occur to start marking it untill the posts began showing up in Reddit.  Sample size is small and relatively pointless though, just funny.
---
Yeah I know, but almost all my guildies are getting in and multiple of them live in the same city as I do.
---
This exact same thing happened to me in WC other day, first roll was 92 then 2nd roll we both rolled 17
---
Loved being a rogue. Haven't played in about 8 years and went Druid for a change.  Kinda regret it. Even with healing it's hard having no cc ability when out solo.
---
I created macros of the healing spell ranks then load the macro into it as a spell.
---
Funniest interview ever!
---
Can you still use your phones touch screen to target?
---
Are there any blue posts on todays ddos yet?
---
I paid $15/mo for them :)
---
I just don't find zerging stuff with AoE fun, if I wanted that I would play retail
---
Yeah, between that and being mounted I don't give out too many buffs out in the world. I'll do it if I'm in town, though.
---
I got a dog like a year into my time in vanilla. Named her after someone I played with.

She died two days ago of old age basically....

This is fucking great!

Exactly the same for me! Loving rogue. A friend of mine if playing a pally so reliving some of the nostalgia through him ;)

I have never understood why so many people like to watch him.  I tried a few times.  At first I thought it was that people enjoy watching like you would morbidly enjoy watching a train wreck or for the cringe factor of watching Micheal Scott in The Office...
---
But it seems a lot of people genuinely like him.  It boggles the mind.
---
A good example would be a black lotus.  It usually spawn every 2h I think.  If there's 10 layer it means there's a possibility of picking up the same herb 10x by layering hop.  Or even an Elite with insane drop.  You can kill him, layer hop and dodge the respawn time
---
He has his own sub. Suckle him on there.
---
I'm sorry, are you offended?  I didn't realize this was a college safe-space.
---
Without PVP there's nothing to do between raid lockouts - easier leveling but boring at 60.
---
I hit level 26 today and I feel really good about that.
---
nope, dash 1

yeah wtf, this was always the thing to do in vanilla. BoE blues and above were fair game and everyone should roll need. BoP were need before greed. This thread is ridiculous.

Fuck, really? I though the DDoS was still going on. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I don't know why this happens so often with Blizzard specifically.
---
I don't understand why you find healing boring, almost every run the group manages to get itself into a position that requires strict Mana management and actually thinking about who you heal and what you cast.
---
I've found healing in classic to be much more rewarding than retail and have received compliments after cleaning up a near wipe and saving the group from a graveyard run.
---
Maybe your groups were playing too safe for you to find it enjoyable? I even planned on going full shadow and decided on Disc/Holy because of how fun healing is.
---
I won't help out a hunter or a rogue, because they *will* FD/vanish and leave you to die.
---
I was 8 playing vanilla I made a hunter and made it to 60 in like a year did MC 1 time never cleared it I think maybe got through like 2 bosses and then BC came out where I developed into a druid healer and tank player lol
---
If the warlock is utilizing water and health stones and occasional bandages there’s nothing wrong with it. Healers should expect to be going oom from time to time. 
---
Everyone should be using their health and mana resources to the absolute maximum of their ability to ensure solid dungeon runs. 
---
As long as the warlock isn’t sitting there tapping to full mana and sitting around while the healer is drinking constantly after every pull I think it’s fine.
---
They aren't "allowed" to, it's just not easy to actually find them.
---
Educate me my fellow resditors. Why lvling a warrior is bad?
---
Grid+Clique I use xperl (I think that's the name) for customizable UI along with Bartender

I think it is called Elvui. It's really easy to set up.

I'm horde in STV and it's always like 10 alliance going around killing everyone.  While horde fighting  in global chat about stealing their own mobs lol.

I've had multiple people whisper me being mad that I didn't help them in PvP situations. I was just walking around with my map open and didn't see them. :(
---
tell me how you really feel.
---
Yeah I'm a rogue and I use my sprint as often as I can. But my friend told me I probably won't see a mount until level 40 which seems ridiculous.
---
You sound hella mad. Do you get mad at actors or other entertainment when they dont act 100% themselves or pay up their personality? I'm playing the game and watching him it's no different than me watching a Netflix show because that's exactly what it is. A Show. This isn't an arguement this our opinions that differ you already said you dont understand watching streaming in general so what are you trying to accomplish here? 
---
We enjoy different things and that okay.
---
Hmm no wonder you were squelched.  
---
Spastic lol.

Why fury ia bad?

Posted this somewhere else but....  
---
Was doing quests in sundown marsh in the Wetlands, and saw a group of three gnolls guarding a chest. I then chanced upon a warrior who i asked for assistance in cleaning the group - he could tank and I’ll burn em. He asked if I could sap one so we could fight just two at first, but I told him we’ll be fine.  
---
I knew we had no chance. I watched him tick down fast until he booked it, mobs in route.   
---
 Vanished, left the party, looted the chest for myself, and went on my way.
---
There is...
---
`/roll 100-100`
---
Does join /4 work also?
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
bruh. You guys outnumber us like... a lot. when I was in STV there was like like 5 horde for every 1 ally on Skeram. QQ more
---
Attacking someone 10 levels higher is pretty dumb so I'm not surprised horde are doing that
---
How good is that guide?
---
Since most players have two leveled professions the "skilled labor" in it isn't really worth much, unless you have access to rare BoE patterns. Then you can probably make bank
---
Two gathering professions will probably net you more money
---
i want to make a hunter, i have never played wow before except getting to level 20 on mage on classic, but want to make a horde character to play with a friend, but not sure about 'class builds', i'm not sure what to put my talent points into on hunter, is there a certain hunter build that is good to play?
---
I don’t think arcane explosion had a cast time in BC.... not sure about vanilla. Your chat ban probably has something to do with the anger inlaid in the stuff you write, as seen here.
---
You wouldnt say nat 20 if a d20 had only 20's on it....
---
make like Epstein and "kill yourself".
---
I’m trying to run Atlasloot on my Mac. I’ve gotten other addons to work, but this one refuses to. Any tips?
---
The DDOS attack is starting to take it's toll. LMAO.
---
True, I'd say Shaman is probably least played, or Paladin.
---
It’s lightning in a bottle.  People like it the same way people still like CS 1.6 or Halo 2, or Final Fantasy 7.  Sometimes a game just gets it right and future iterations are just imperfect remixes of the original.
---
Same which makes it even more frustrating lmao.  Happened earlier but got back in after I went and did some stuff for a few hours, got back in for an hour then back to this.
---
Life tapping is fine, just don’t life tap yourself into oblivion during an overpull then use hellfire. 
---
Other than that usually takes 2-3 pulls before I figure what percent you can tap to before one heal tops the lock off. I then let them know and toss a renew after the heal.
---
Should be ClassicAuraDurations.
---
The "world" channel is a good one too, some LFG but lots of chit chat too.
---
I played a hunter back in 2005 and I will never forget the adventure of finding out about broken tooth. It was something I heard from one of the best hunters on my small server from the best guild on that server. I hunted for what seemed like forever to find him but when I finally got Broken Tooth it was like I had just tamed a mage killing machine. Hunters are a blast!
---
I want to take this time to rant on the mind set of the player base, especially on pvp servers. When I come across opposing faction players in neutral zones, about 90% of them will wave or totally ignore me. My own faction does the same. We've become so focused on leveling and getting to level 60 that we are barely enjoying the game as it was intended. We've picked to play on a PvP server so that we can pretend to be on a PvE server.
---
Now for the context of this picture. There were about 15 alliance camping Nesingwary's camp for about 20-30 minutes. I'd heard enough about it in General that I decided to form a raid group to counter them. Well, about 5 people responded, and three of us stuck around long enough to actually fight and get some kills. After getting my rez timer to a minute and a half I gave up because apparently everyone only wanted to bitch about being ganked and not actually do anything about it.
---
Let it be known that the horde on Skeram-US have been bested by the alliance today. You all are disappointing.

I'd be fine with another authenticator, poultry sacrifice, and the return of prima nocta.
---
Or the public flogging of ddos attackers followed by them carted off to prison.
---
Gnome Mage.
---
Picked Gnome because I was in the middle of leveling a Gnome Hunter on retail, picked Mage because I figured the portals/teleports/conjures would be extremely helpful down the road. 
---
I'm a Melee at heart and because of it my Classic experience has been full of death.
---
Yeah iirc the war didn’t go hot til Cata
---
There's great money in nightfin, but I wouldn't expect to make bank for another couple of months. The soup is commonly used in raids, and the majority of players are nowhere near that point. Bank that shit and profit later. It will pay off. :)
---
I'm just gonna say it. Default UI kinda sucks.
---
Zug Zug
---
lol
---
What about skinning? Going herb on my lock and skin on my hunter and curious which will be more valuable
---
Did you thank him?
---
You’re thinking deathknight
---
It goes fast. And you're not risking death. So, you can take out 25 mobs faster than you can take out 5 by yourself.
---
And it's more fun
---
Ah, you mean the Public Forum For Debating VC or DM.

Communists are the scum of the world.
---
always has been, always will be. and they kill their own people for their ideology.. the nazis didn't even do that.  
---
i get a snicker of sarcasm from your comment, but i wouldn't be surprised if you said it unironically as there are a shit ton of retards in this world.. you may very well be one of them.
---
Go to bed.
---
Fair enough, just me being pessimistic thinking it's a retail effect.
---
Haven’t joined that one, thanks for the reminder!
---
Brainlet confirmed.
---
Servers merged during actual retail vanilla.
---
Layering was not a feature in actual retail vanilla.
---
BFA brainlet confirmed.
---
Laughs in elemental shaman
---
Is it like a REST service?
---
O tal do BR é hue de mais.
---
I'd argue it's a dick move to expect no one else on a massive multiplayer game to not use a limited resource just because you were there first
---
It sounds like zug zug... has ended.
---
haha wow props on your eagle eyes
---
Which is fine, you play how you wish. I enjoy working together to manage big pulls. Having someone focus a caster, cc another and pulling 3/4 packs together and then AoEing and killing them all. I find it fun, not everyone has to, but man does going back to pug groups feel really slow after that.
---
IMO it doesnt really matter end game. Not only that but INT doesnt give spell power so at the very best it may give you the few extra mana needed to give you 1 more spell. It also gives spell crit but a tiny amount
---
Well the Orcs under Thrall were trying to return to their shamanistic, hunter gatherer tribe lifestyle. I think when they met the Tauren then found a kindred spirit in the race that paralleled the culture they were trying for reclaim.
---
The only time I wish I still had windows as a dual boot.. was wondering why my roommate could get on but I couldnt.
---
I think it's the premier guide for leveling. I used it every time I leveled on a pserver with no issues.
---
On our server, we had a good 2-3 hour if not longer skirmish, where we won and ally won some back n forth. It was glorius!
---
Only downer was that the few peeps who partied up for the endevour logged off soon as ally started to gain grounds. 
---
But i stuck around and so eventually more horde came in and fights begun anew, and circle repeated itself. 
---
Sure i could've focused on lvling.. but my is it so fun. :) 
---
At one point we we're around 20v20 or 30v30ish. And along comes the random peeps joining in. 
---
That said, the next days it'll be 15+ horde on +3 allys etc so... don't feel to bad about it.
---
I mean, Barrens is pretty bad too. I actually kinda like Ashenvale.
---
You're upset that people aren't playing the game how you want them to play the game?
---
really really big waste of time
---
Original Vanilla World record time leveling guide... I'd say decent lol.  Better than anything I couldve figured out myself even after leveling 3x lvl 70 during TBC.
---
My friend bought the guide and I've been using it since I already know the content so I'm rushing my way to 60.
---
It's easy to use, lot of maps, works for every class, have personalized addition to the guide for certain class.  You'll save alot of time but alt-tab every 5 minutes can get annoying if you don't have a second monitor
---
I forget what level exactly but the raptors just south of menithil harbour were pretty good
---
Nami Haha. Also, RIP to the both of you. Unless he is a fully decked out warrior with BiS in all slots and the rank 14 great sword. Then RIP all of them. But that's like impossible hahahaha.
---
Are we acceptable at doing dungeons? - Yes
---
Are we acceptable at doing Raids? - Yes
---
Are we acceptable at PVP? - Yes
---
Are you optimal for all of the above? Not exactly.
---
Not really hard. But so far it doesn't seem like y'all know much about the attacker. It's really tough to do anything when you can't know much.
---
Beast master is a good one to level. 
---
It basically doesn't matter what talents you are until over level 55. It's cheap to respect at first so it doesn't matter.
---
Bruh, priest is amazing at solo leveling. can handle multiple mobs with ease.
---
dot and wand all day brother.
---
Viable!
---
You have roots for pvp
---
What about running up to a node and mining between someone else’s loot?
---
Was not in game last sunday.
---
Thousands? Hardly. It's cute how you care enough to look up my post history LMAOLUL
---
Mostly looking for Mug'thol/Archimonde connections i think.
---
sweet brah you pagan too?
---
Heil Odin.
---
I need about tree fiddy
---
You copied and pasted the link I provided
---
Did you... did you just now compare me to a terrorist?  Lol wtf is happening
---
And retailers didn't like running until level 40. To each their own. Your arguments are still exactly the same as the wall of no and those arguing against Blizz bringing back Classic
---
Lol what the fudge. You paid?!. I hope you have your mount already. Otherwise your an idiot
---
Enjoy!
---
Playing into their class fantasy, I like it.
---
Thank you!
---
All it takes is 5 people to report someone and they will be silenced for 48hrs....
---
Nonono I meant by giving them credit for what they did. Not being a terrorist
---
It’s just become conventional wisdom that leveling warriors is super hard, and it’s one of those times that conventional wisdom is wrong. Advice everywhere says don’t touch prot and dump all of your points into arms or you won’t have any rage. But putting some points into prot early on — especially defense and armor bonuses — and accepting that you will be relying on your auto-attack and saving your rage for dmg mitigation skills makes it easy to take multiple same level mobs. And if you have a decent weapon the autoattack+rend is more than enough.
---
Website doesnt load for me. Says 404 Error, website may be outdated or moved somewhere else.
---
Would be curious to see those pictures lol
---
False, one only takes over Ogrimmar when they have assaulted the ah/banker. Killing an npc is fake new on a pvp server.
---
Yeah I don't mind having 3 sets to farm. I just want to be the most useful possible for my teams in dungeons and raids mostly. 
---
Thanks! :)
---
How well do druids scale with gear?
---
You just have to be invited to a party.  If the party is in a different layer you'll be transferred to said layer so you can see them and interact with them.  And Yes but people on the internet always spoil the good things.  
---
Try it for fun.  Go in a crowded area like Orgrimmar if you are a badass or stormwind if you are a filthy alliance.  Ask for someone in your guild to invite you.  And watch as everyone disappear and a new crowd appear
---
I'm on Mirage Raceway EU and honestly our server seems to be pretty meta-agnostic lol. I think I saw a 10 man LFG before it was patched only one single time. Plenty of people looking to farm dungeons but almost no one asking for spellcleave comps and such.
---
Correct, however before BC the Belves had red eyes, and as far as I'm aware they didnt have much lore or reason yet
---
I agree though the haze effects give me flashbacks to being in countries where they burn all the garbage and excrement they produce...
---
Anyone speccing fire in Australia is a menace to society and should be imprisoned immediately. Shit just ain't funny
---
I didn't. You and thousands of others of users make this same comment all the time, since probably the year ~2010. BUT ITS 2019 BRO AND HAH U STILL HAVE A MOBILE PHOOOONE?!?
---
If there's more than one of these in your post history, thats a yikers
---
How do you report these?
---
Legend
---
Then what's the post for?
---
The only rough part honestly ends when you get the weapon skills and you are able to use better weapons as you get them. As soon as I got a green 2 hander at like level 10 I spent 10 silver on 2 handed swords in under city and went from annoyingly slow to I can kill like 8-10 things back to back non stop. Just a good weapon alone changes the tide of warrior leveling
---
How do people get him? I tried it once on my server at like 4-5am (a thursday) 2-3 Allys and 2-3 hordler wanted him, at the end someone killed broken tooth, because everyone wanted to take the aggro from the one currently taming him. I mean its fine that you can kill eachother (pvp server) but its bullshit that someone from the same faction can stop you from taming.
---
Currently playing with a swamp jaguar and fine with him too tho.
---
And you were free to agree to the ToS, which you did.  This was *your* choice.  You're acting like a loser over meaningless vidya.
---
For a normal non heroic dungeon? That’s more than good enough gear
---
if it’s my group i’ll kick them, if it’s not I tend to end up with the under levelled hunter sitting last on dps and the druid who’s assigned himself stupid roles like off tank/healer in a 5 man siding with them and I usually can’t even be bothered dealing with it and going through the trouble of replacing them especially because rogues do really good dps
---
Lol you should be upset with an actors performance if they do a crap job. Makes sense there. Ppl are shoveling time and money into a person pretending to be what it takes to only get said money. Nothing more to it. I didn't say they shouldnt or can't do ut, doesn't affect me any. Just failing to see how much about him is positive.
---
Just make sure to turn off general chat.
---
I was expecting this shit so fucking much, I can get high on Ninja compilations and Wipe flaming compilations, one of the best things of early WoW fucking nerdragers
---
well i dont have xfinity internet cus they are trash so idk
---
Everything is rude apparently. I was a bored lvl 28 tank waiting for my group outside of RFK and challenged a 32 arms warrior to a duel and almost won. I didnt talk any trash at all and their guild group lost their fucking marbles. I was getting spam rude whispers and duel challenges. The one rogue made a /spit macro and spammed it so fast I had to /ignore them just to see what anyone was saying.
---
Everything is rude, and everyone seems to be a screeching child. Everyone is a quest item ninjaing, ore stealing, insta cast tag then run away while you have aggro on their kill-ing douche. It’s extremely sad and off putting.
---
going to do my first dungeon soon can i tank with 2h ? or i need a shield and 1h
---
I was excited to hit 22 tonight...
---
*Those hunters are assholes*
---
You're right, the more I play the more I'll learn and understand my role as a druid and how to maximize my potential. I'll check into feral until then!
---
Thanks!
---
And what do you do with all the people who wanted classic but don't want TBC, do you host classic servers still and split the community more or do you force them to choose between TBC and retail? 
---
Why are classic private servers so much more popular than TBC private servers? 
---
It's obvious a lot more people wanted classic than TBC.
---
On the eastern side of Teldrassil, east of Starbreeze Village, there are large tree branches you can run out onto.
---
I had a similar guild name on retail and they forced me to change it (similar in the sense that swapping the first two letters resulted in something bad)
---
I agree, except that A SHIT TON of stuff depended on those little frozen orb things. Which isn’t really too bad of a con to begin with. Great expansion overall
---
Uninstanced Stratholme requires a chair, seesaw, teleport, leap, or gateway spell. I mean, its EASY, but I find it easier to mention the Tirisfal trick :D thanks for bringing it up though!
---
It doesn't matter at the earliest levels but yeah you should keep a pocket shield and 1h.
---
Came here to say this
---
It's amazing how many people send someone a douchebag message and then instantly /ignore
---
I was ahead of the curve on my Mage and the whispers were such a weird thing to experience considering I was on a completely different account than my main retail account I have actual networking on. Like I'm used to getting asked to join for boosts and keys and stuff a lot but having that happen from complete strangers was so strange. I started in Cata so I have never really experienced that before outside of people on my friend list and guilds/communities/discords etc.
---
Alt right click. And auctionator let's you change the default tab.
---
From using them both a lot years ago, I chose auctionator as a preference but they weren't too different overall.
---
Ok and you understand they are in no way comparable to a school shooter considering one is grossly more serious correct?
---
nice dodge dipshit
---
I mean, unless the pull has gone seriously wrong, then that shouldn't be a big problem in a normal 5 man pull. If the DPS is consistently doing it, then just talk to them.
---
It may be my fault. SM was pretty neutral. Until i started baiting people sitting there marked /afk until horde attacked.
---
And then... Battle. Been fucked ever since I started that a couple days ago 😅
---
https://www.avoidstreamers.com
---
Check out that site. As for high level gankers, that's probably every server, but I'm not sure if any are particularly bad with that
---
I feel your pain. Someone in our guild mentioned they were only 4 at the time vanilla came out. Yet i was already 2 years into college. Time flies when your having fun man.
---
Anyone else hear the Indiana Jones music when he jumped?
---
Imagine soloing anything when there are a thousand people who would do the dungeon with you.
---
Pretty well. 
---
They get a lot of attack power from strength and agility. Their weapons don't give huge upgrades though.
---
I'm just trying to get petty revenge on someone from my own faction tagging everything I targeted so I couldn't quest.
---
sometimes its holding sockets open others its more like a flood of trash packets. I have not seen anything talking about the type of attack other then its some form of ddos.
---
You're definitely right
---
Add-on that makes the slick action bars?
---
Been noticing more toxicity doing dungeons this time around. I don't really remember it being like this during vanilla. Maybe it happened and I was too young at the time.
---
Fuck that, play whatever character you'd like. The race choice does not matter when you are brand new to the game. Helps to immerse your self when you play your first choice as well.
---
I played 8 years on a wotlk server just doing pvp, because I highly dislike that expansions pve.
---
I never got bored, open world pvp is just too much fun.
---
Doubtful.
---
I
---
Conversely, on my Server I pretty much saw none of that. It really feels like, despite the hype surrounding serves like Herod being "the true vanilla experience server", the best way is to play on a lower pop server all the meta slaves avoided if you want to experience a laid back casual classic experience. 
---
We still only have a handful of 60s on our server.
---
$11 something jagex is powerless
---
As other have said, not a huge difference, but the added armor and extra dmg resistance from block is pretty handy
---
Re-read. Also school shootings are rare and 10x worse things happen every single weekend in the US like in Chicago and Baltimore etc but the news doesn't cover it
---
One of the best things I've read in awhile
---
Also Linux user, able to connect via phone hotspot but not home connection.
---
Very disappointed if they really are blacklisting Linux clients...

---
we get banned for jew jokes while blizzard implement fucking Schutstaffel imagery on the fucking furniture in their game.
---
Been using Vuhdo for years and years. It’s an excellent heal Addon.
---
Rather than have gear power grow it would be good for them to release gear that make more specs viable. 
---
For example rather than release a higher tier set release another one with stats from the same tier but the tier bonus say for paladins is you gain ability taunt. Or druids shapeshifting mana is reduced by 90%. Or have a chance to restore a good %  mana when casting a shock to make ele shaman more viable etc etc.
---
Keep the values the same but add more ways to play.
---
Just grab the feline agility talent at level 20 and 21. 
---
It'll increase your movement speed while outdoors by up to 30% while a cat. 
---
This is the only mandatory talent while leveling. 
---
The police will find you and arrest you if you don't.
---
probably have an easier time levelling on horde because of wpvp
---
gnome has the int buff which helps though
---
really it’s not going to matter too much
---
Hoping for justice is fine. I don't think anyone is going to argue with the notion that this guy should should serve some time or pay a fine, but the person who sparked this debate is taking issue with comments that are hoping he gets raped in jail, murdered, or commits suicide.
---
Rape and murder are not typically punishments we should be doling out to people who made it inconvenient to play a game for a weekend.
---
still better to join a group and split the tags between 5 than to be alone and potentially get no tags at all IMO.
---
I love pally tanks in pug dungeons!  Hive them a little time and i can spam multi shot all day long!
---
Based on this bug report I'd assume this wasn't intended, since this is absolutely not how it worked in vanilla at all.
---
Have you run around Hillsbrad Foothills much? Maybe you just missed out on pvp servers that prioritize it. Grobbulus has a shit ton of world pvp.
---
Mark David Chapman was aiming at Yoko and missed.
---
I think his point is that he is questioning if a community poll is a good idea. I imagine those that have an active sub would be able to vote but that would mean that retail players and classic players would have a say in voting. So the concern is that voting would not represent the Classic community.
---
Personally, I think classic should stay as it is. No additions. And I expect it to stay how it is. This is one area where I truly believe in the slippery slope theory.
---
I see you were also part of the Grobulus Southshore battle that's been raging all weekend.
---
I mean if he's the only one who can unlock it why shouldn't it be his loot?
---
Website?
---
dodge? lmao stupid commie.
---
heil hitler.
---
Lol. I'm 3-boxing. I had to get 18 of those... 3 times.
---
I still cry before going to bed
---
Whichever one you think is cooler
---
I like how the chat window looks (font, colors, etc). Any chance I could get the add-ons and specifications being used there?
---
/u/Daffan I had that issue once and I *don't* even use QuestLogEx (I use Classic Quest Log because that's the first I found didn't know about QuestLogEx). Never looked into why as it only happened once and a /reload fixed it.
---
Sorry, it's just /targetenemy
---
and yea, add the conditional [stealth] if you just want a command to work while stealthed.
---
Had a lockbox drop. 3/5 group roll greed, hunter tried waiting till end to roll need. So i roll need, out of spite. Won, opened it to a blue. 
---
He was complaining the whole time about getting no loot while exploring and tried to steal it. Felt good, man.
---
Warrior leveling is like the worst in the game. I would advise you to: 
---
1) find groups of 3+ for all of your questing 
---
2) if you are going to quest solo, quest in areas where you're mostly killing lower level mobs (even doing green quests/mobs)
---
3) learn to tank and level primarily through dungeons
---
first points should go into wand spec &amp; then spirit tap then you are laughing.
---
Again, same arguments thrown out by anti-classic retailers.
---
You're targeting a Pygmy Surf Crawler.  You need to find a regular Surf Crawler.
---
Maybe later is lamer*
---
Wait, not all dungeons are being cleared in 12 minutes with 3 mages?
---
I went to curseforge, and the drop down menu for version select classic and download the latest version. Also check the box that says “load out of date addons” in the character select screens addon menu
---
How can you even compare any post vanilla dungeon design/difficulty to vanilla ones...   
---
Like all these 'endgame' dungeons in vanilla are glorified Wailing Caverns in terms of mechanics and difficulty.
---
you only need to take note of the main hand really. Your offhand can be whatever has a good dps
---
Ironically I was on my way to turn in the last quest in the chain that has you do a trust jump off of one of the spires out there, so maybe that is what made me do it.
---
Yes, it does get better.
---
It's a social game, make connections with players who know what they're doing. Join a guild with a good community and group with those players. Classic puts the responsibility on you to form the group, to take advantage of it.
---
The other way it'll get better, is that knowledge of how to play the game will spread. Right now people just do what works in retail, if you go the other way (use classic strats in retail) you wont do very well either.
---
Godspeed, Chestnutz. You incredible bastard.
---
Join a guild is the best advice. What server are you on?
---
I had a similar problem, i was trying to tame a "pygmy surf crawler" instead of "surf crawler".
---
Hope this helps
---
world of warcraft is basically racism
---
It's a sensitive subject though, that's for sure.
---
The Herod transfers aren’t open to those severs - they’re open to Earthfury only.
---
Sometimes That Guy was created, not born though.  I was minding my own business running through Duskwood to Swamp of Sorrows when a Shadow Priest closish to my my level decided to try to kill me, and a bunch of random lowbies joined in on the fun.  I died.  So I came back, with a vengeance.  I killed them all, one by one, and every quest giver I could find, for hours.  
---
I just wanted to go finish my fishing quest(Nat Pagle was relying on me!), and those fuckers started shit.  My hand was forced, I am sure I killed some innocents by the end of it all, but had that shadow priest and group of lowbies just let me ride on through as I intended the slaughter never would have been necessary.  
---
In the end, we create our own villains.
---
Hope he gets some jail time, actually ruined my weekend...
---
If you’re soloing you probably want to be shadow unless you’ve got ages to wand things to death. I’m going healspec early for easier ins with dungeon groups who prefer a healer with PI, and I’ll have a disc pvp build anyway so might as well get that now since i do lots of group content and wpvp
---
It’s not about now.  It’s about six months from now.
---
Then the group can let him clear the pack surrounding the chest on his own.
---
Dude when BGs hit you want that fast queue time for the rank 14 grind
---
Faerlina
---
Get in the habit sooner than later, you are more useful utility wise with a shield anyway
---
Half of these comments are stupidity like this. No rings equipped then 2 agi is a big upgrade. Warriors BIS leveling weapons are staffs most of the time. Every caster loses their shit because "that's not a warrior weapon" - yeah, it is.
---
TIL chat is faction specific
---
My game immediately disconnects me when I try to report anyone..
---
Did you join /world?
---
Literally no one asked for this.
---
Dude went 0 - 60 pretty quick LOL
---
Yes pick up the next tier for sure.
---
As for money, higher tiered mats sell for more money
---
Skeram has a lot more H, yeah. Earthfury is low pop, but growing and has about a 60H/40A split it seems.
---
Need it to then sell?
---
Is for fire that burns down the whole town
---
I mean... he's right...
---
Besides joining a guild, you will find so many people on the same quests as you who will join up with you.  I have been invited to so many groups since classic was released.
---
BGs.
---
Tbh if the tank doesn’t pace well, and we’re all 75%(or some reasonable amount) hp/mana after each full mob fight I’ll go pull the next even as a healer.
---
For sure I don’t expect new players to set quick tempo but when I know we can dial it up I’ll do that and normally they’ll get the idea we don’t have to hard stop after each pull. 
---
And if not /shrugs they’re welcome to ply the game how they want I just won’t add them for future dungeons. 
---
Although if they’re new _and_ communicating reservations/ questions that’s a different story and I’m happy to assist in learning experiences
---
Whats he talking about, asking for a friend I would never cheat... or exploit.
---
This thing has made my questing efficiency while walking, be to the max. Bad ass addon.
---
I think the most relevant thing that you've said there (not saying the other points are crap, they're entirely reasonable; just not really discussion worthy), is the idea of "whoever decides that is in your group".
---
The obvious problem is that because we essentially live in an LFG world, as opposed to the same people running dungeons repeatedly, it's relevant in my view to try come up with some kind of objective standard, as opposed to a subjective standard, in order to maximise good across all groups, as opposed to each individual group. This is primarily because every group that forms isn't going to have the time or energy to debate whether everyone is going to need all BoEs or not, and the intricacies therein. As said, I don't think "I am going to use this" is an unreasonable measure. I come back to the original argument that many have come back to frequently - the fact that greed = "I will sell this" is obvious based on the fact that it's representative symbol is literally *gold coins*. I really don't get why anyone can think, "hmmm, there's an option that looks like gold, and is called "greed", but I'm going to use this gold, so I'll need the gear!". Prima facie (assuming no prior discussion on the matter amongst group members) it's just absurd. 
---
To put it another way, can you really imagine every group going "so we need all BoEs yeah?" and then every group member just going along with it - as this thread proves unequivocally, many people do not have that opinion. Of course if a given group comes to an agreement, sure. If anyone isn't cool with that they really need a head check, but 'a given group' isn't going to be many groups.
---
There any proof of this?  Did blizzard make a statement? I got a bunch or friends on the other faction and I plan on having a good time in BRM
---
Battlegrounds still exist on PvE servers.
---
So much running around in vanilla, I'm loving classic codex to direct me. I personally don't enjoy going the complete wrong direction in my already limited time I get to spend playing classic.
---
Each to their own of course.
---
lol k keep pretending collecting cans is viable due to definition.
---
fucking dumb.
---
&gt;like saying you exploiting governement helps is not illegal its just smart.
---
Except this is a VIDEO GAME.
---
you need to pay for the game time, classic isn’t free even for a trial
---
Nah I'm sure alliance does this on pvp servers as well
---
Need to add game time, you pay monthly.
---
It's free with an active subscription.
---
its not free. you need to sub
---
Ran with 3 warriors and a shaman cleave group grinding to 60, it wasn't until LBRS that we had to actually go for a shield and 1h.
---
With that said, milage may vary, try to keep a shield on hand, just in case.
---
You should add gametime.
---
Did you have instant quest text enabled at the time?
---
Whatever side you enjoy doing quests and grinding exp on.
---
Yeah you were totally right, that was easy. Thanks!
---
3 or 2.5 talented
---
I've moved from Herod to Skeram to Earthfury.
---
Herod was always hours in the que. Skeram was a little better. Earthfury never has a que but it feels desolate. Horde capital cities have like 20 people in them. Take my advice...stay put.
---
No that's not a reason to hit a child.
---
Yup the risk in PUGS is real
---
currently leveling 1 main and two alts, is now the time or should I focus on getting one char to end game before splitting my already limited time?
---
yeah i realised after this I had explained it wrong. Whoops!
---
Heal and GHeal are both 2.5 or 3s cast times by the way
---
If you struggle on warlock you’ll only struggle that much more on another class as they’re easy to level. Like others said: dot, wand, and sit back.
---
I feel like NE and Tauren would go together well with their respect for nature.
---
What idiot told you it was "free"?
---
you're telling me that a game they have been marketing as free, is only accessible past a paywall?!
---
Torch runs.
---
But is leatherworking a good profession late game or not?
---
I hit 50 as Paladin and just completely lost the urge to level. I am enjoying my lower level mage though. 
---
Is it worth rerolling at this point? I know the easy answer is “yes okay what you want” but I feel like I wasted time if I did reroll. Are mages in high demand at end game?
---
I can definitely see the issue. I didn't create the guild so didn't choose the name.
---
I do think it's a lot less risqué than a huge portion of guild names I see daily
---
Cries in elemental mage.
---
I can feel his left wrist aching.
---
“It’s part of the fun to figure out where you have to go” - So who’s stopping you from having fun? It’s why Questie is an addon and not a standard feature.  
---
I played both with and without it and none of it makes a difference. The only reason they’d make a big deal about it is because it’s “unfair” that others surpass them in levels but all this info is readily available online so it’s not like it’s going to stop people from using hints... and they are behind everyone because they don’t grind as much or just plain suck at the game not because of some addon.
---
Classic is free for people who have an active World of Warcraft subscription. 
---
You don't need BFA, just the current base game. 
---
Classic is not playable without a paid WoW subscription.
---
Yep. Grey bear tongues tho...
---
This makes me want to uninstall the game.
---
I remember being one of the leads for a regular pug group on our server that ended up matching the server first for progress back in wotlk, felt good, they ended up poaching a bunch of us, and the rest merged into one of the guilds that participated in the pug, the merged guild of puggers ended up not being able to progress as far after that unfortunately
---
You can use onebag, ark jnventory, or elvui
---
16 in the clip and one in the hole, Chestnutz is about to make some bodies turn cold.
---
Linux user here, getting that issue.
---
What else to do besides leveling??
---
My friend and I have really been enjoying leveling. We both, however, have quite busy schedule(him more than I). Our schedules only meet on the weekends. During weekdays I find myself with nothing to do in my free time because I can’t level without him. I’ve done my professions up to my level cap. Anything else to do while waiting around to level?
---
That's debate-able. Some people actually are forward thinking when they make decisions...
---
You can play retail for a trial to I think level 20 maybe. Classic wow you need an active subscription
---
Did you think it was lying to you?  You need game time.
---
Your reddit name suits you. You must be retarded for typing shit like that and actually believe it.
---
I just hit 33 today on of paladin and only just replaced cruel barb, that thing is incredibly op for its lvl!
---
I'm just gonna say it, we can stop appropriating ft. and feat. into every single reddit post.
---
As someone who always played on both sides: It's exactly the same
---
Yes I did
---
Retail does take effort, I never said it didn't. But the community aspect is "afk and wait for whatever to pop."
---

DKP was a point scoring system back in the day that determined who got Raid drops and shit I believe

Best explanation yet! Ty
---
Thanks for this. I'm running via Linux and can confirm that I'm still unable to connect.
---
You sir, are diabolically evil.  Well done.
---
Higher damage (not necessarily DPS) in MH. This will generally be a slower weapon, most likely a sword or mace. Offhand shouldn't be a huge concern, just whatever high DPS you end up with.
---
You're not old. You're just lucky to have experienced vanilla. :)
---
No shit. It's still annoying.
---
But the Night Elf banned him! /s
---
NERD!!!! jk im sad too
---
its called Extended Character Stats
---
BoEs are all roll need. If you don't want loot drama, the sooner you adopt this, the better you'll be.
---
You're right man I do have schizophrenia, and what are you going to do about it?
---
All hail the true king of Stormwind!
---
Priest
---
i did that, still no luck
---
Most propable is state actor.
---
Or corporate espionage.
---
Interesting idea. If it doesn’t exist I’ll look into making it.
---
So what you're saying is "That Guy" is contagious? We need a containment procedure.
---
The *earliest* you can aoe grind is 20, honestly it's a pain in the dick even then. I usually level to 25ish before I convert over to AoE grind. Look up the guide "in frost we trust" it's a bit old but perfect for vanilla.
---
As far as normal leveling goes its tricky, just try and stick to large open areas where you can cast at max range. If you agro a mob from 35 yards you should get 3ish spells off before they even get to you. Then frost nova and fire a few more, ded.
---
Cheers
---
Am I the only Rogue in vanilla that helps the opposite faction whenever possible, and actively make sure people know I’m there with a /bow and /brandish before any WPVP? Honestly, until there’s HKs in the game, I’d rather just /wave and keep questing. 
---
That said I’ve got a list of names on my desk of people that have ganked me or any of my brethren. Those guys get got whenever I run into them.
---
[Blizz has said there's single digit layers on each realm](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294920/blizzard-responds-on-layering-abuse-in-classic-wow)
---
Realms are several times the size of vanilla realms ["While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further"](https://wccftech.com/extreme-wow-classic-queues/)
---
[But then they did expand the cap](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294779/maximum-wow-classic-realm-capacity-increase)
---
So each realm has several times OG vanilla servers + a substantial increase after that.  Single digit layers.  And they said before they don't do dead layers there's a minimum number of players for one to exist.  So maybe there's one low pop layer the size of a lower pop OG vanilla server and then 2-4 high pop OG vanilla server layers.   Anyways hope this info i sourced helps people's understanding.

How do I download and play *only* WoW Classic(and not retail)? 
---
How big is the Classic file size? 
---
I have limited HDD on my laptop, my only useable PC, and limited internet data (I’m on a cellular hotspot atm). I can’t download the entire WoW retail since it would be a waste of storage and a waste of internet data. So is there a way to just download WoW Classic? 
---
I’m on the Blizzard website on the Classic page and it gives the option to download and do the free trial. It just doesn’t indicate if it’s *only* the download for classic. The trial link takes me to the download page which has a “World of Warcraft” download upturn among all the other Blizzard games. 
---
I assume many on this sub are playing only Classic so hopefully someone can help.
---
You're the guy who pulls when rage generators are on CD and the next pack is in an unseen patrols path so you need to range pull it and 75% mana isn't enough to clear both I guess. Tbh, if you don't know the place like the back of your hand, don't pull, eod. If you do, then you should try just putting an r in chat, unless that level of communication with the team you are trying to work with is too challenging for you.
---
Classic was the first game. That is why there was such a demand to play Classic. So there is your rebuttal. They were the servers worked on the most as they were the oldest too. There are a lot of other variable that tie into that such as established community. People don't like playing on dead servers and will stay where there friends are.
---
Your arguments thus far have been:
---
- You think you do but you don't
---
- No financial reason to bring it back
---
- It will split the community too much
---
- Nobody likes/will like the changes
---
- I don't like x and so others don't
---
- Nobody wants TBC, the community who wants it is too small
---
- My version is just more popular
---
- My version is obviously better
---

Go back a zone
---
Fishing is sometimes a good way to earn money, especially In the late game. Other things I wish I had time to work on (if I were in your situation) are:
---
1. to get a bank alt into a city with bags equipped and able to be the main point of contact with the auction house and sales
---
2. Fishing and cooking
---
3. Making gold for your 40 and 60 mount with your professions
---
4. If you have already done all these things, but are keen to play more wow, you could also consider an alt. I know a couple who level their toons only when they're logged in together, but have another alt that they focus on when not levelling with each other. I personally keep one toon around the same level as my friends who I want to level with while focusing on levelling one of them while solo
---
You are a little fuck boy and a nerd, you have no life so you diagnose other people with illnesses, I see fuck wad.  It's sad man, a hamster has better ways of finding it then you do.  Keep sitting in the bleachers watching your life slip away.
---
There is no PvP etiquette. 
---
Stonetalon peak is a contested zone, both horde and alliance are there. There are quest hubs for both.
---
Spell reflect? Spell reflect doesn't exist in classic, IIRC.
---
Oh yeah keep going
---
There is no point in PvP if you have no rewards.
---
theres an addon called spy that might do what you want, haven't used it personally tho
---
Well done sir.
---
Basically, you can't make extra parallel content without progression of some sort. Gear, levels, etc.
---
OSRS can do it because most everyone is in a state of perpetual non-maxing.
---
Azeroth huh
---
You can make an alt character to play on the sides.
---
I've had a few of these but mostly a positive experience so far. Classic is so much better than my retail experience overall.
---
My favorite was I ran WC a few times and the chests were all first come first serve by those groups, and my last run I assumed it was just the way thing were done and the tank rage quit and ignored me after I ninja'd a chest.
---
The rest of the group was understanding and squared me away that we roll for chests, but he was so petty and even ignored other teammates who tried to explain to him I wasn't being malicious. 
---
Blows my mind that some people react this way, especially in anything so low level
---
No it just tanks for you (badly).  Once you learn the game a little more try switching to a style where you take most of the damage and use drain life a lot with a succubus pet out, it's more fun, faster, and significantly better for PvP if you're on a PvP server.
---
Me
---
You are literally crying over 6 hours out of 720.  Do the math.  That is literally $0.12.
---
Are you a peasant?  Because youre too stupid to realize
---
1. Blizzard did not cause the downtime.  In fact, they worked to rectify it, per their agreement with you, which you did not read.
---
2. Blizzard does not owe you shit.
---
And then they all realized they were on the wrong zeppelin
---
With layering I've died 242 times about 160 of that in stv to alliance. I've killed more than I've died and I'm only lvl36. So no I'd like layer to stay so I have a chance to Atleast level. You simply play on a server with a horde majority, or are a rogue or druid or some other class that can pick their battles. I'm on this server, TM was so laggy last night it was unusable.
---
Is that what you did man, did you go and get help when you felt a little off in your head?  Lol people like you don't last very long.
---
no. engeneering and alchemy boost warrior MUCH more then mage.
---
and some things like reflectors just not works against warriors and mage may crush his own face :)
---
I had a guy do this because he thought I ran mobs into him. Someone did, but I just happened to be passing by and caught his rage instead. I still gave him a rez because I wanted him to swallow his pride and take it. I win.
---
Naw just hit the ground like nothing happened and play the single death animation for the specified race
---
This was a real dumb thing to say
---
&gt;Extended Character Stats
---
Awesome, thank you. ill let you know if I find out why
---
The fact that the other two alliance actually listened and stopped is cool.  Sometimes I wish I'd rolled PVP for those kinds of interactions being more common.
---
Lol I had a dude whisper me last night because I posted 5 silk bags lower than his claiming I was "ruining the market" since he just spent all his money on silk and now couldn't make as big of a profit as he wanted.
---
I hate that you felt the need to put a /s.
---
I upvoted your comment. Made me chuckle :)
---
Sounds like an idea for Retail.
---
Farm, BG's, level up alt
---
If you have more time to spare then maybe reconsider how your life is going.
---
The game actively tires to kill me, and here it is helping you out
---
A lot of private servers have either ceased or preparing for a tbc launch
---
The server won't care because he'll be on enough ignore lists after a half dozen people spam trade and guild chats
---
Cept op isn’t horde
---
They were callled 'huntards' in vanilla... rightly or wrongly, it was a pretty well-known meme.
---
no I don't
---
I mean, there's a reason dps queues on retail are 30+ mins. No one wants to play tank or healer. Doing the job no one  wants to do gives you more say. DPS are quite literally less important, they're extremely replaceable. I have never minded abiding by the tank or healer's "rules" when DPSing because I get to come and just hurr durr my face on my keyboard.
---
Tbf, each server will be roughly the same in the long run. I’d just stick one out and get to know people better and settle into a guild once you find one.
---
Took me longer to get mine, but I got the deathcharger and Raven Lord on the same day
---
Imagine being such a fucking loser you have to ddos attack a video game in order to feel like you have power. I dont even play wow but this kinda shit is just sad and pathetic.
---
Barb Kellner, the pizza eater
---
It means more than just uncivilized though, it also means fierce, violent, and uncontrolled. For instance, as a racial ability, the undead can eat who they have killed.
---
Mage?
---
Update: I put in a support ticket as suggested, explained what happened and provided a screenshot. A GM got back to me 24 hrs later, they checked the log and put the bow in my mailbox with a nice message :)
---
ok retard
---
LMFAO I'm Daredevil in this picture @ [u/Whatwouldrivendo](https://www.reddit.com/user/Whatwouldrivendo/)  I was actually like out for blood because another rogue and mage had killed Nami (also in this picture) and myself several times. Sorry man sometimes you do the getting and some times you get got !
---
There's a guild on the RP server that is called  Paladin Help Club (if I remember correctly). The guy was in fact a paladin. I don't know how often they help, but we grouped and finished a quest.
---
Actually, nm that, if you've never tanked vanilla, never pull. You don't understand the game well enough yet and you'll make runs slower overall. I know it sounds rude or insulting or whatever, and I'm not trying to be, it's just the truth, which is sometimes uncomfortable.
---
I played WoW on my late 2013 MacBook Pro a few years ago before I sold it. It would run decently with medium graphics but only for 10 minutes until thermal throttling.
---
You got issues bro.  Guessing you were not a great teacher but you love patting yourself on the back for trying.  Everyone reading your comments is probably calling bullshit.
---
WOTLK if I'm not mistaken
---
I pay rogues to open them!
---
Why would I ask a rogue to do something for free?
---
Yeah someone being punished by an automated system is really great for the game and not open for abuse at all...
---
He isnt shoving beliefs down anyone's throat. He just named his character that.
---
Its like the fact that a religion exists utterly offends you. His name isnt the problem. Your mindset is the problem.
---
Dude reminds me of Sloth from the goonies.
---
Murder is its own reward
---
Grats man that's awesome! That long wait for him though damn, son. How did you get 90g by level 40? I'm at 33 and I have like 15g, I don't get how people get so much money in their 30s.
---
See a need, fill a need!
---
It absolutely is, it is as virulent a plague as Corrupted Blood!
---
I manage taunt
---
So damn underrated...
---
I get a little too happy when I spot a corpse and get to rez it.
---
And then am pretty disappointed when either they don't accept (probably AFK) or I realize I'm trying to target an Alliance corpse (usually involves me finally rotating the camera straight down over their body while repeatedly clicking and looking perplexed).
---
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you (and people like you) for providing cheap fish so I can level up cooking without having to spend all day fishing.
---
I think I’ll end up making an alt and fishing for gold when we hit 20. Thanks for the advice
---
Lvl 32, leatherworking and 30g
---
Best server! Grobbolus something
---
1) Level as Feral
---
2) Get the movespeed talent 
---
3) Get Omen of Clarity
---
4) Pick up damage nodes after that, or whatever you think suits you. You can't really go wrong, and you'll be respeccing when you hit 60 anyway so just do you.
---
My heal hotkey is getting twitchy just watching you two.
---
Auto taunt, claw. If I don’t auto taunt, I almost always pull aggro.
---
It is now.
---
Was questing in Redridge and started a group for the elite orc guy at the top of the keep. Invited a paladin and set out to the keep while looking for more. Once we got there we saw another group of four, the paladin left group immediately and joined them instead. So I stealthed to the top of the keep ahead of them while they cleared mobs. I waited in the boss room until they got to the top. They buffed up, got into position and body pulled the group of mobs. At that exact moment I sprinted to the boss and garroted him to get the tag and then feinted. The boss and his adds then aggroed onto the entire group. The boss literally kept running from group member to group member cutting them down as they tried not to attack him and only the adds. Eventually they gave into survival instincts and targeted the boss taking him down leaving me to loot the head and run out. Sweet revenge.
---
Waste of mana
---
I let Bite auto cast, I control Claw and Growl. 
---
I let the pet cast Bite, then I growl. I then will Claw and growl until bite is coming of Cd then pool the energy for another Bite.
---
It's hard to answer, but a player with engineering will never lose to an equally skilled player without engineering.
---
I have much better luck with my Voidwalker keeping aggro if I don't use Immolate, or I use it after my VW has hit a few times to build a little bit of threat. Seems to work pretty well. Just CoA and Corruption &gt; wand and Immolate if I need to kill it quicker. Plus Immolate is not super mana efficient. Just my 2 cents.
---
Still an overrated comment.
---
Thanks for the advice, man. Have you noticed any differences playing horde or alliance?
---
I grinded on my main until around level 30 and started hating my character. I started playing on a toon for a few days. Then my urge to level and hit 60 came back, I got some new gear which made my main look dope, and the spark kind of just came back. Take a break from your main and do what you want with another character, I'm sure the will to hit max on your pala will come back. No one is saying that you have to "finish" one character before you can start a new one
---
Have no idea about the demand on mages lol.
---
I would say turn off auto taunt as you need to get used to turning it off in dungeons and managing your threat
---
Personally, I prefer everyone just needs on BoEs. It's the fairest option.
---
A) It avoids 4 people greeding only for the last guy to need to get something really valuable.
---
B) Realistically, whoever wanted that item could just spend the gold to buy it. They don't want to do that, instead they want their party to give up on that gold (opportunity cost). Gold that could have been spent on an equivalent gear piece for them.
---
All that said, I generally don't care unless it's something ridiculously valuable and go with whatever the party wants to do for the run if everyone else is on the same page.
---
No idea but the pet was called Hyacinth macaw
---
Are you literally laughing your ass off?
---
I sold an emerald whelpling on day 5 for 50g, helped get me my mount. I bought a crimson whelpling for 7g yesterday.
---
What a guy. Thanks.
---
Looks like I’m playing as undead female
---
on leveling up dungeons, shit is usually so boring and slow that when we do get into a pinch and i actually have to do something other then renew, shield and wand, its actually pretty entertaining.  and a lot of the time ive noticed DPS have tried to pick the mob off of me after i gain heal agro way more then the damn tanks. and thats usually why I have to heal dps.
---
Haha I don't know if I needed to see this or it should have been left in the corner.
---
Yeah.... it's player run mate
---
I hit up my people on YouTube regarding this: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbKoGWosBkBFMkUAYW8F5jQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbKoGWosBkBFMkUAYW8F5jQ)
---
Btw, I am running AT&amp;T in US. Friends in my state are playing on Windows no problems. Guild mates in other states, no problems, also Windows. 
---
A blue post specifically was asking for your reported errors as they are still looking into things. This was going on yesterday and this is not the first DDoS attack they have dealt with.
---
I agree that getting visibility on this issue in the Linux community is worthwhile. No idea about an ETA on when this would get resolved.
---
If Windows 10 users could log in but Windows 7 and 8 users couldn't log in there would be a poop storm over this.
---
This is nothing to do with ipv6. The servers just go up and down under their regular load and the ddos as well. It's just random chance he's getting in now. That error just happens when the servers are down.
---
Thanks, I should have gone into more details.  I will revisit this post tomorrow after work and begin adding additional information.  It's time for bed for me though.
---

Anyway, same here. I was flying from Sentinel hill to Lakeshire and when I landed.. well it hovered for a bit then BAM! falling from the sky into the water on the west fall border. Then 15 minutes of 3 minute lag trying to get logged out or exited.

They may not be the top dog in raid DPS in AQ/Naxx, but they are absolute monsters at pretty much everything else. Very strong class.

What is the main leveling experience difference for Alliance vs Horde? Got my class all sorted out (warlock) and narrowed it down to 2 races both of which I like the look of but they are on opposing factions. I don't care about minmaxing or racials but was wondering if one of the factions has better quests, community, and zones on my journey to level 60. Or do they just start of differently and end up in the same area by mid level?

Lol terrible? Because I don't want to pay if ddos becomes a weekend thing? I only said IF (keyword here) it's going to be like this. I only get to play limited times. If I can't play during those times on many occasions, why would I still sub?
---
I'm wrong for not wanting to pay for something I can't use when I have the time? What world are you living in? Who gets this offended by someone wanting to be able to play? Lol good lord.

I think Eng is probably the worst but enchanting close behind. Blacksmithing iirc isnt actually that bad.

There's a guy on my server that sell premium bags made by "Supreme" I have to wonder how effective a strategy that is.
---
Orc has far better pvp racials but whats even more important in boosting your success would be your spec. You will struggle in pvp as enh and faceroll the fuck out of alli in ele. Enh has a few issues but I think the biggest is just how insanely slow it is. You have no in combat movement abilities and not much for ranged either... so youll just find yourself being so much slower with limited ranged attacks to make up for it and it might well be very painful.

Going by that logic, the healer doesn't have to heal him. If the rogue wanted heals, he should've gone a healer.

---
Notice it says "protect" and not secure or prevent. Your anti-virus protects from virus. Not prevents them. If you think blizzard just sits back and relax, you're an idiot. Ddos happens to every major server related game or service.
---
Pretty sure the name even carries to retail to this very day
---
They could just add a FP transit for the instanced. Wouldn’t be too hard at all
---
Imagine coming up with a conspiracy theory that blizzard is breaking their own servers on purpose...
---
Wowhead classic class levelling guides are reasonable places to start. Make sure you read why they're doing things though, not just blindly put the points in.

"Is that like a super rare drop?". Nah man its not a big deal, just a legendary. Hope it went to a hunter.

For example I want to make a macro:

"%t" still works in classic but "%loc" does not.

If it requires an addon, is there a light weight stand alone one?  Thanks.

That's being generous.

OP gave his reasoning before you even posted this

&gt; in regards to all the assumptions, they were 90s at vendor and he was referring to the bid price of 95, all my buyouts were 1g 20s or higher depending on what the current market was. Also, i’m alliance with south shore as my hearth so it was always convenient after SM runs to hearth back to SS, buy a few books and then spend 3s to fly from refuge point to ironforge. All my listings were 24 hours so any low bid would always raise and I have never sold a book for less than a gold. send tweet

So would I need an entirely separate account or would a WoW2 with a separate paid subscription work under the same account?

classic wow warrior class is highly gear dependent. If you are dying to everything, sadly the only solution is to grind better gear.

However, once you do have said gear, you'll be ruthless. I am seriously looking forward to 2020+ videos of fury warriors in full tier 2.5

Usually npc's dog pets. And the thiefcatcher dude in ironforge.

they're pretty good healers, so maybe give that a shot
---
I can only speak for myself but im not going to let them die but theres a limit.

If a mage pulls aggro and doesnt kite away i will go oom spamming to keep them up. Then the tank dies and we wipe. Its much better to sacrifice the mage and res them after.

Paladins want Corrupted Ashbringer, Sulfuras is terrible for them. 
---
Enhancement is very weapon dependent to do well, which is why you may think Elemental is better. However, enhancement is better with the right weapon, which are terribly scarce due to type limitation. This makes Sulfuras BIS for them. Not broken or anything, but the weapon gives them a stupidly strong damage increase. 
---
Would they prefer other weapons, like paladins and warriors, if enhancement could equip more weapon types? Definitely. Right now though, this is why Sulfuras is so strong for them.

I'd say the rogue has a right to the loot in the box unless its gear. Then he has an obligation to make sure everyone rolls before closing the box so the roll winner can loot the gear.

Right but instead of assisting you and attacking your target it just stays on spot it was summoned at forever unless a mob runs directly past it.

Vanilla private servers always worked fine, don't know about classic and don't care. Blizzard keeps making shit for linux users harder and harder everyday, so I wont bother spending shit on their games.

Also FF14 runs perfectly with proton for the steam version.
---
I don't think that's ever worked for me, unfortunately. Every time I've been chill with an Alliance friend and some Horde attack, when I yell "HEY NO STOP, HE'S COOL DON'T HURT HIM" I usually just get insulted or they say something like "quit being a carebear it's a pvp server".

Like, I get it, it _is_ a PvP server, but it doesn't mean we constantly have to be at each other's throats.

I think BC really hammered in the min/max since raids got mechanically harder. It was also when people started to get an idea of what was going on... so the game became about the meters

I’m 26 and sometimes my problem is not being able to use enough mana.

no one ever said "normally", aoe grind leveling especially with layering is super viable, so there's no reason to act like it doesn't count
---
Usually the mob in question will give off signs of noticing you before attacking.  If you see a mob turn toward you from ridiculously far away, like about the range a mob would attack you normally, odds are that mob has super stealth detection.  
---
As for mods that would help you with this, I don’t know.  Perhaps there is a database of high stealth detection mobs somewhere out there.
---
As a long time healer, we expect it from warlocks - especially in classic. Tap on, we’ll get you when we can!
---
Most of the time, that's true. But that shadow priest was probably minding her own business running through Arathi and got stomped by a horde mob. It never started with the person who murdered you. There was the person who murdered her, who was murdered by someone else, who was just taking revenge for his own ganking in STV. We all think we're the ones who were wronged.
---
I've played both sides, and it was the same experience for me both times. ie, I had your opinion about the Alliance when I played Horde, but then I had that opinion about the Horde when I played Alliance.

Oh the feels!  I have so many skills I haven't purchased ...... and I'm playing a FREAKING WARLOCK!  Damn those Grimoires!

In low level dungeons, what should my basic tank rotation be? As both warrior and druid. Really unsure what best to generate threat with, so many differing things online. Around level 18.
---
The classic version of this is you write his name down on a notepad and put out your own bounty in general or trade. The whole point of classic instead of retail is for you to do it not some system to do it for you.
---
"please disable pets taunt"
---
*Crickets*
---
that's intentional
---
If you're not trying to powerlevel (and as a new player I would suggest absolutely not doing that) then go with doing all the quests you can, and hit up dungeons when the quests lead into them.

Was on my Orc Warrior yesterday and saw someone fishing near the bridge that leads to The Barrens. Decided to do some fishing, too. I mouse over his name and realize that it's a Human. We fished in silence and then I ran off to finish my quests. PvE realms are great, because you never have to worry about getting ganked. :)
---
It works fine. They have a dedicated classic version and I haven't had any issues whatsoever.
---
Archer user here exactly same issue both wife and daughter in Windows...boom they get in.
---
Me on arch..hell no!!
---
Very, very true. I've been playing since about a month after vanilla release, and I forgot just how big the world was, even though we have a lot less square footage than in retail. I'm even seeing a lot of stuff for the first time, and finding things I didn't know existed. And not just in zones I skipped (I didn't do much Kalimdor back in the day), I'm finding brand new stuff in zones I spent a lot of time in. I'm excited to see new things in an old world. 
---
And the community has been amazing. Honestly, I'd even go so far as to say it's better than Vanilla. I think it's because people are coming in with an idealized version of what it used to be like, and are making an effort to help create that world. I'm getting more random buffs, I'm getting into more random quest groups, I've had more random social interactions than I remember back in the day. I really hope this lasts.
---
I mean, 5 level 60’s stand a chance against 1 geared 60rogue...
---
Even a group of level 50’s can win that fight tbh. Just not 30’s in a hundred years.
---
Yahhhhh except you're probably missing out on a bunch of quests that could coincide with other quests by not going and turning them in. Not very efficient at all
---
You mean Fraps 60 in the corners, right?
---
Thanksfully for you, classic WoW is almost as slow-paced and simple as everquest... so if you liked the 1-button rotation of EQ up until... depths of darkhollow? ish? classic will feel very familiar to you.
---
Retail with it's fast-paced action might be too much of a jump...
---
farming gnomer at 60 for wirings should be ezpz, is my plan anyway
---
As if people aren't (mostly) the same irregardless of chosen faction.
---
Yeah I was freely advertising about how I was in hyjal yesterday in world chat, even logged out there overnight. I think they're a bit more lax on that now.
---
no one actually kicks in retail
---
you guys are either making a problem out of one instance or troll constantly and get kicked, it's a lot more effort to kick people than it is to sit through the shit with them
---
to be hoenst you're more likely to get kicked from classic with how much bullshit goes on in the mid30s-40s dungeons
---
How does that have anything to do with capitalism? That's literally not what I said, I said "within reason" for a reason you dunce. People *willingly* gave the guy shit because they were entertained by him, how does that poison any mind whatsoever? You absolute lunatic
---
I was killing trolls in the same area as OP, level 45 horde warlock pulled too many trolls and was dying. I went in to help him (42, alliance, Mage), after the fight ends he starts eating/drinking and doesn’t emote anything. Couple seconds later, proceeds to dot and fear me, killing me at the end. Hard questioning myself why I even helped him, actual feelsbadman.
---
My point is the reaction you have to those questions is the same reaction most people have whenever they hear someone talk about Asmongold. A random person in a bar would know the name Kardashian but not Asmongold and yet you still wouldn't give a shit what a Kardashian did in World of Warcraft.
---
To put it more succinctly, the vast majority of people don't care about a D-list gamer celeb. Asmongold has his own subreddit.
---
What about the windows?? Is it activated?

Honestly the peaceful interactions are even moreso amazing on pvp servers because you for a fact you could both have each others throats at any given moment but instead you just/hug. The subtle adrenaline rush is really satisfying
---
My friend from OG wow and I were out questing and someone asked him the same about his little panda.  Except the kid's response was "oh. Heck. I think my parents were probably still virgins back then" and just ran away. 
---
I was struggling to breathe for at least 5 minutes
---
well then im guessing its WOW's problem because my ping on games like csgo , dota 2 etc its 5-20ms

Yup.

The real problem is that most (not all) botnet operators are located in countries where the governments either don't give a shit or are actively supporting these guys.

Even with all the ddosing I still managed to get from 27 to 30 this weekend!! Woop woop
---
Also got my whole dang house clean and folded my laundry, which I never do lol
---
You can absolutely play completely solo, and if you find a tough enemy or other people questing in the same area you can ask them if they want to group up for the quest you're on. 
---
If you want to do a dungeon then sit out the front of it and keep an eye on general chat for groups forming up, or ask other people lingering at the entrance if they have a spot free in their group.

You mad bro?

Hey my Void Walkers name is Hukmoth, too!

Not downplaying school shootings, its that they are so well known because the media draws attention to them even though the equivalent of 10 school shootings happen every weekend in Chicago and yet no one cares. It's basically virtue signalling by media and we shouldn't be doing it here glorifying these terrorists. The reason we DDOS today is because of the reddit and 4chan posts made about this attack from friday/sat (the attackers words not mine)
---
Why
---
War, thus it continues
---
The rare in a game from 2006 is referencing a popular 2017~ artist??

havent had any luck with them either,  but i was only grinding on them when in the area for quests.

Farming them there in P2 without layering would be.... interesting as well to say the least XD

That's where my noobs play!
---
Last I checked target dummy loot tables were broken. Did they get fixed? If not I would save ur target dummies
---
Immersive to me is a class that is the most unique.  So honestly I would say rogue.  They have two separate rogue only skills to level(lock picking and poisons) and very in depth class quests and lore.
---
Honorable mention to locks and druids.  The class quests were really unique.
---
War...war never changes...
---
I think my #1 pet peeve as a tank is people pulling aggro and then proceeding to run away from me.  
---
They're not moving faster than the mob. They're not preventing the damage being dealt to them. They're literally just making it harder for the tank to get aggro back. Run TO me, not away.
---
Is that from the dreaded blood plague?
---
I wouldn't recommend this. The drops for greys in classic vs private servers are different, and the SOS Jags in classic have terrible drop rates.
---
Wait till Classic becomes like p-servers in their fifth year tho... :(
---
Warlock, shaman, rogue, paladin, druid
---
If I had to choose one, I'd say warlock

Why on earth would those be harder with a bunch of mages?

&gt;  It cost 6s each way from Org to Duskwallow
---
How in the bloody fuck is this relevant at all?
---
Orc will help you significantly because you will want to be in direct contact with the classes that have stuns (rogue, warrior, paladin).
---
Imo, people will complain at you for your choices but you'll get plenty of experience with the build in STV/Badlands to know if you enjoy it. Easy to respec/regear if you decide you don't like it :)
---
That's a 1 in 13,500 drop rate. ***Rarest pet in the game.***
---
I thought we already got over our differences.
---
Remember that the healer generates no mana from when they start casting a heal until 5 seconds after the cast finishes. It's very expensive to "top people up".
---
I think that every class is immersive in classic, which is part of what makes it so awesome. But speaking from my experience as a shaman so far, ive loved the class quests. I had to travel accross azeroth and master each element to earn my totems. And now that i have them, my totems make me desirable in groups because they provide powerful buffs for my allies like windfury.
---
&gt; griefing
---
hahahahahahaha ahhhhhhhh hahahahaha
---
So where did it wear off so quickly for you?
---
It gets bad in PVP servers since you have to itemize for PVP, meaning most of your gear will be agi/sta. In dungeons you’ll get maybe 4 rotations on a boss before going OOM with this itemization. At 60 you start to get better gear with agi/sta/int/spi all on the same item so it gets better, but not until then.
---
I’m more worried about raiding if they don’t fix the feign death bug.
---
It's not 3% dps increase.  It's just 3.
---
Look at the items and see which ones you want.
---
The thing is though is that Warriors are really cool. I wanna play one but I am worried about it being too difficult.
---
I hear you, I hated tanking that place so much on my warrior, especially since if anything but a plate dps pulled aggro you had a couple of seconds to get it back before the person got turned into pink mist.
---
Ah, you guys are great. I haven't had a good laugh like that in a minute.
---
You'll start stancedancing at level 10. How many times are impossible to say. I probably danced 100 times in a SM run yesterday as dps.
---
I had the same problem until I somehow managed to get IPv6 working.
---
yeah in like 6months or even later
---
Nuts so big they go up to his chest

Oof. I feel old, though I guess Karl Malone was "The Mailman", not Post Malone. My mistake.

I don’t get what the problem is . That’s literally what was happening in the original wow when it came out . This is as authentic as it gets stop complaining
---
As a mage with a pocket priest, this...this is my life.
---
This applies to all versions of WoW, definitely. I hit 120 in BFA and started mythics immediately the week of release and I never experienced any issues people complained about with pugging high keys. Then I took a break and came back and every pub group I ran with was filled with people who apparently had no arms and questionable brain activity.
---
Holy shit
---
Agreed 100%. That'd be like me raiding as balance/kitty and innervating myself instead of healers because "it's my ability".
---
Ooooooof, that dude who spent 20g on that will make a huge profit (500g - 1000g) next phase.
---
Wand is a scary amount of DPS while leveling. I've had a few healers top the meters during those early dungeons by literally just wanding in between heals.  
---
Don't start DPSing right away is the biggest thing. Let the tank hit a couple times - especially Warriors and Druids that need to build up rage for their first AoE.
---
Level both
---
Since no one stated. classislc is less than 10GB
---
Just the state of people and their loot, especially at 60, is awful.  Everyone kept preaching community but it’s toxic as hell for the most part.
---
Layering being dropped won’t affect queue times.  Layers have nothing to do with server capacity limits.
---
Yes, you are, and you just did. It's not the fact that it's just a shooting, it's the fact that it's in a place of supposed safety, and that there *fucking children,* not adults killing adults.
---
Had pretty good drop rates for me. Had my mount at 40.

What're your keybinds for switching stances? I know it comes down to personal preference but still.
---
Someone named Steadman got the channel ownership. He banned everyone from the world channel.
---
Any1 have any tips for action bars set up as a shaman especially keybindings
---
Is there any downside to making an alt to mail treasures to to list on the auction house?
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
As a Tankadin, you probably wouldn't even be in the raid.
---
Bestial Wrath tears them apart or forces an early ice block. Druids have little issue with mages also. I worry more about shadow priests.
---
Indeed, community driven systems like this are in the spirit of classic.
---
&gt; Should I go for classic or regular wow?
---
With a subscription, you can play both.  That gets you all of Classic and you can play all of the Retail game except for the latest expansion.  Then if you like Classic better you don't have to pay anything else.  And if you like Retail better you can consider buying BFA.
---
Not to be elitist or anything but you’re not getting an inv to MC to tank unless you scrounge a group of friends to carry you.
---
They will never lock faction creation. Dumb as hell.
---
Ah I play RPPvE so no worries about anything but mobs. What's up with FD? I don't have it unlocked yet.
---
I assume the only difference being collusion that causes disruptive gameplay.  Organizing pvp events and stuff, I can’t imagine that would cause an issue.
---
Little bit less of a wholesome story - but here goes. Was questing in STV on my orc rogue, and a dwarf priest decided it would be funny to kill me with a shot from his wand after I had just barely survived a multiple mob pull. I was level 43, he was 36. Well, he might've got some cheap yuks about that at first - however, I was in a foul mood at the time, and wasn't about to let him just get away with that. And so I spent the next hour stalking and hunting him through the jungle, and brutally murdering him at every given opportunity. 
---
I must have killed him over 12 times, until he called three of his guildmates over, and then proceeded to have them act as his personal body guards - all of them started running around together, right on top of each other. At that point, I made a mental note of his character name, and decided to leave him alone for the time being. But he made an enemy that day. And I am the type to hold a grudge.
---
Oh it's usually the opposite. The harder proffs to level can make you a killing because nobody wants to do it
---
What is proper etiquette when rolling on extremely valuable recipes (moongoose, crusader, flasks, hide of the wild)?
---
Does everyone need? Greed?
---
Or should someone with the applicable proffession at 300 skill be prioritized?
---
In pugs.
---
!remind me 8 hours
---
That’s fantastic &amp; I hope a GM investigates it so they can see how fantastic it was. I don’t see anything wrong here
---
wont be happening.
---
Kazzak got a fixed reset point now. There was a blue post about it the week before release. Also mentioning that many other mobs dont, so happy testing.
---
You got the whirlwind sword, not the whirlwind axe
---
Definently no summoning stones. Why even give a warlock the summon ability if a stone makes is completely invalid? It's something cool we bring to a party and a reason to want a warlock. Kinda like mage water.
---
This, I found the deviate recipe and spent a bunch of time waiting for people at WC.. so now I have enough Pirate Fish to last me to 60.

Hi, /u/ManyArrival

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1m4c9/should_i_play_warlock_or_shaman_horde/). 
---
Well played.
---
no to all that’s just casualised terrible crap
---
the faction imbalance is part of the game
---
The barrens.... fuck the barrens...
---
AOE grind? or kill them one by one?
---
You’re now a Personal Attack.
---
Streamers should all be placed on the same server. By themselves. And let the rest of us play.
---
It’s supposed to drop you from combat unless it gets resisted. It currently doesn’t do that. Even when it doesn’t get resisted, you’re still in combat.
---
This is a huge handicap for Hunters. We need to be out of combat to use traps, which is essential for PVP. We need to be out of combat to drink during a boss fight, which is essential for raiding.
---
We can’t do either of those reliably, so we’re basically dead in the water.
---
I just love taurens. But alliance races don't ruin their shoes. If you care about your shoe aesthetic, choose carefully!
---
Is there a discord for things like Molten Core Pugs?
---
Project 1999 came out in 2009? I think and it's more popular than ever as of 2019
---
You're right. Guess I'll go to bed then.
---
There's not a lot they can do now, most people are 25+ and won't reroll even if there's queues, and most people that will play are already playing so locking character creation won't do anything. All PvP realms are horde heavy so no shuffling or transfers will help. 
---
Blizzard could have done something in the first week but it's too late now. I guess they just don't think it's a big problem and we have to hope they're right.
---
Do you have reading comprehension issues? 19 kids were shot in Chicago last weekend, how many kids in schools were shot last weekend? Your statement right there proves that you get news from facebook.
---
The first time I grouped with a warlock, for about 10 min I thought all the mild smacktalk was him talking to me and not his demon talking to him...
---
It astonishes me how people can play so far zoomed in. My girlfriend plays the same way and when I look over at her screen all I can see is her cloak. It’s actually hilarious, there are times where I’m running behind her about 10 yards and she asks “where did you go”. Also she keyboard turns and is a clicker but that’s none of my business. Now I’m rambling. Anyways, nice vid :) For the Horde!
---
Imo classic is a 100x better new player experience. I wouldn’t recommend playing BFA at all unless your boosting to 110 and doing raids or PvP.
---
Just as an FYI layering doesn't impact login queue times. It depends on what is more important to you. A less frustrating leveling experience or a potentially more frustrating max level experience. If you don't see yourself playing endgame content go with the transfer.
---
Man, I hated that quest.  Couldn't complete it until I hit level 31 on my rogue, because I couldn't do enough damage to sustain aggro.  Feero just kept dying on me.
---
Ah yeah that's a big problem, have they acknowledged they're aware of the bug? That's a very obvious glaring issue.
---
Well it makes more sense on a pvp server because you're always flagged, but often people choose not to attack each other like in OP's story
---
Barrens is called /b/arrens for a reason. What were you expecting?
---
Well yesterday they were attacking the servers.... I dont know if they changed today but they definately attacked WoW directly yesterday. They said as much. Twitch.tv they took down the day before. They tweet everything live
---
That specific phrase - to me anyways, and how I interpret it - the whole "you must be fun at parties" thing...I don't necessarily regard as terribly offensive.
---
And also, the way it's worded also gives quite a good deal of wiggle room for you to fashion your own retort or witty remark without being overly combative.
---
It's kinda like it's more of something said because the person seems like he's in a bad or dark mood at the moment, it's not really an indictment of the person's personality flaws as a whole.
---
That's how I take it. It's not the worst thing someone can say to you, and indeed there's lots of creative ways to fashion a comeback that's humorous and will make both of you laugh it off.
---
I can guarantee you the latter would never happen. I have this guy on my friends list and I always jokingly role play as a poor starving fisherman trying to sell fish to get by. Unfortunately he has never bought a single fish. Maybe he just doesn’t like me... Someday I’ll get him to buy one.
---
That implies I actually trained disengage!
---
Can you show proof a lot of other people want TBC over classic? You're the first I've seen.
---
There was undeniable proof that classic was wanted by masses.
---
Saying it's the exact same arguement means nothing because you have no actual rebuttal. You basically proved my point that classic is more popular than TBC too..
---
Skinning + leatherworking
---
Mining + engineering
---
Enchanting + (leatherworking or engineering)
---
Alchemy is viable too, has its uses. Herbing to get mats for enchanting.
---
Why do you guys insist on grinding SM over and over? The spam regarding it is crazy if it reflects the number doing it. Streamers influence this game a lot even on this level
---
It has healbot.
---
That is just evil
---
Actually this is my life...
---
Voidwalker is a meme

Yesterday, I grouped with a random paladin who was killing raptors in Wetlands.  I helped him finish up his part of the quest, and he came back with the final phase we were both on.  We killed the last raptor boss, and I got a nice new bow out of it.  I thanked him and we started going our separate ways. 
---
As I'm about to run off, he whispers me asking if I could use some shoulders he had just picked up.  Leather shoulders of Agility.  +7 Agi shoulders at level 22 are pretty much unheard of, and he could have easily made up to a gold selling it on the AH.  He refused to take any money from me and just handed them over.
---
Your experience is not what I have seen at all.  I have multiple other stories just like this.
---
Woah, I'm with you. Except you race to max level by questing in heirlooms these days.
---
being muted for a few days because of a crappy automated system is definitely worse than just putting spammers on ignore.
---
BoP items can't be sold to other players.  It's pretty simple.  if it is bop, only roll if you can equip it and it's an upgrade.  If it's boe, it has significant value outside of being equipped by classes that can use it.  To pretend they are the same thing is completely dishonest.
---
I think it's mostly people being salty that people are 60 while they are still 20. Although telling other people how to enjoy the game has been common pastime for a lot of people on this sub.
---
No see, it's fine to not support Linux, that's a-ok, and their loss in the end but still no issue because Linux said fuck that and made their games compatible anyways via proton (bless gaben) dxvk and lutris 
---
It's hard to understand if you're a windows peasant but it really is the pride of Linux users everywhere when Linux just cuts its own path to reach the goal- and we did and it worked and was great, but blizzard for no legitimate reason blacklisted clients that reported Linux headers (again, if you understood netsec and shit you'd get why there's no legitimate reason) 
---
Don't even @me with "hurr it wuz for seckyuritee" cause honey that's not how it works.
---
Linux users use linux because we want to be left alone by microshaft and the others in the funky bunch of software predation, why do we get punished for putting in the effort and work to make YOUR game compatible with our os, FOR FREE.
---
Why do we get shit on when Linux is not only easier to develop on, but games run *better* natively on Linux than they do on windows (that's a fact, even Linus did a video on it)
---
So excuse me for being "entitled" for not wanting these consistently malicious entities to constantly shit on my doorstep when I specifically moved towns to get away.
---
Level 20 already? I am still creating my character. Wow is about the journey not the destionation, dont rush it.
---
yeah he’s gonna get a ban and this’ll be reverted within 12 hours
---
Listen, it sucks. You run into jerks like this from time to time. Maybe you are just really unlucky, because my experience has been nothing but positive. But this is the risk you take when grouping up with randoms. These guys will likely pull shit like this again, and as more of these events happen, more and more people are going to know about them and bar them from things.
---
I'm not telling you to continue. If you want to stop, then stop. Sometimes, however, you just need to take the good with the bad. Keep your chin up and move on. The good experiences WILL happen and, yes, the bad ones too.
---
If you’re a mage, murlocs in Dustwallow Marsh.
---
Neesons is my shit
---
You have no idea if that’s true. Same thing was said about osrs and thank god they changed their mind there.
---
Can confirm, on pserver nearly every jaguar dropped a grey, in classic it was more like every fourth or fifth.

Are there any leathermaking recipes that can make some money (140 LM)?

This happens on every server, that's why people always advice to just not join it.

Can ret paladins be a viable dps at level 60 dungeons?
---
Youtube didnt exist until 2007
---
It is a factor in why I stopped playing years ago. I would get yelled at for not knowing what I was doing regardless of the level. 
---
I haven't experienced that in Classic so far. In fact, I had a great Deadmines run with some folks just today even though we wiped 5 times. Nobody got salty.
---
I was and continue to plan to be upfront about my experience though- when looking for a group I said I had never done it before. While I have only had one negative player interaction in Classic so far, I think announcing inexperience might help mitigate potential future issues with the community.
---
After a particularly stressful dungeon run, I really needed to hear this.
---
Did you import any strings for the layout? Or customize it yourself for all of it?
---
:(
---
Repops? Or is this WC? Havent ran that in years.
---
The repops can be stupid right now. Was in a spot earlier with my friend and had mobs spawn all through out the area with us in the middle
---
I was looking around for a way to change my nameplates, I didn't realize ElvUI was an option. Thanks for the reminder.

Can ret paladins be viable dps at level 60 dungeons?

My husband has learned that if he doesn’t wait for me to finish getting mana I will be shadowmelded and drinking while the mobs beat him to death 😂

How do I level as holy priest I cant take it anymore.

Kidding, I love my priest but damn if I dont get shredded at my level (13)

Does this get any better or are there any tips I could use?

go to program files, WoW, classic wow and add a direct shortcut to the desktop 
---
skips the bnet shit all together
---
No ty
---
If only there was some sort of way to collect various armour appearances and pay a certain amount of gold to customise your character... maybe some time down the track.
---
Yup agreed, and it's worst when you run into these very people. You know them instantly - by their classist/racist remarks. How they regard hybrid classes with a bad attitude and only acknowledge purebreds.
---
I notice that there's quite a bit more of these individuals the higher average level you are.
---
🙃
---
Reminds me of when I was spamming jump on the way to the elevator and it started to go down right as I was jumping into it and just jumped straight thru the whole thing and died
---
As a priest I Hate ressing, healing and buffing people and not getting even a /thanks or a ty, and mostly those who can buff back and they dont even bother. Even so i will keep doing what i do, it seems natural and some people really apreciate it and make it worth it
---
I was all the dumb mages who jump in a mob pull of 3+ before the mobs even get to the tank and then aoe like its out of style would be able of such self-critic.
---
It depends on you, your spec, your gear, your 'tank', his spec, his gear, and if you're fighting similar-level enemies.
---
A lot of people tank or heal with DPS (or hybrid) specs, and that's usually fine but can make it a little more challenging (depending on the content).
---
I've had a lot of fun with it, since it's simple but relies on solid decision-making to play optimally.  For example, as a Paladin I can pop off massive heals with Holy Light, but they're expensive, and every time I cast a spell my spirit-based mana regeneration pauses for 5 seconds.  So ideally I want to wait until the last possible second to cast a heal, top everyone off, use any other utility spells, then stop casting again for as long as possible to let mana regen.  Riding that line between healing too soon (missing out on precious seconds of mana regen) and healing too late (deaths/wipes) is pretty thrilling, and requires acute awareness of how much damage you can expect each party member to take.
---
Anyway, as long as you stick to content that is close to your level you'll be fine and don't need to worry about the details so much.  But if you end up enjoying it, there's a surprising amount of depth to it that you can enjoy.
---
FEEL the STRENGTH of the EARTH.
---
Happened yesterday to me. I was finishing this one harpie to open the chest next to it. Before the last two hits, the chest just disappears into the void. Not like in the video, the chest faded away. No one was near it, because I had it on my screen.
---
Your reply didn't do too great. The humor they couldn't appreciate
---
I won, spunky. Wasn't even good loot lol
---
The Thrill of The Hunt !
---
If you want to stick with your paladin for awhile, but don’t want to level him, maybe you could try looking for dungeon groups on him? If nothing comes up soonish then switch to levelling on your mage. That way you get a taste of endgame dungeons and will know whether you want to invest more in your pally
---
There is an addon that can help a bit called Spy that takes notes of who killed you and has Kill-On-Sight database with alerts that go off when you encounter same player later. It's fun, just google it.
---
Arrived in stv today. 
---
First order of business, skin a tiger. 
---
Orc warrior comes running over to me and charges. Priest attacks me out of nowhere. 
---
The orc skins the tiger.
---
I didn't say either, but I definitely intended to give that impression. I condemned the post because you gave the impression to people who are not in your specific circumstances, who have -not- tanked in vanilla, that the only considerations are health and mana.
---
This is Elvui with time stamps turned on.
---
because if i am groups only xharacter that uses clorh for example.  I would be only one to need =get it.
---
I am not going around stealing plate armor ether.
---
If nobody can use the item/ need it. Then we all select greed (for money) =&gt; equal chance to get it for the reason we alll share, "money".
---
"Need" is basicly just asking "So, anybody want to use this?". And no, you can't need because "My alt can use it". Also if you have some other reason for need that using it right away, you need tell others and ask "Can i need?".
---
Back in the day when WoW came out, this was the common courtesy. Of course you can make deals within your group if everybody agrees to it. It is good to be on the same page wirhin the group. I couldnt be on the group with somebody who would need for gold, better to know that right away than waste hours of my life and end the gaming evening bitterly when some warrior needs for mage staff for pocket money
---
Does the xp rate presume I'm doing every quest in a given region before moving on? I like to squeeze all the content out of a given area before moving on to the next, but I would have to change that habit if it meant that I would end up being overleveled by the time I reached the more narratively engaging quest stuff later on.
---
Classic community so friendly and helpful and everyone waits in lines :)
---
It's not actually that complicated though. In your example, the person who "needs" the item will actually use it forever. It's an enchant/flask that they will always be able to make. The rest of the party should pass and let them have it. 
---
In the OP example we're talking about an item that someone will use for a couple of days and then vendor. It's completely illogical for anyone to equip the item if it can instead be sold to a twink who will use it forever. Everyone should need because everyone should have a chance to sell the item. 
---
That's really what I think we're disputing at the end of the day. Unless you're a twink, you should never "need" a twink item to equip it- you should be selling it to someone who will pay good money to use the item indefinitely.
---
There has always been like that though, you’ll encounter decent people and not very decent people. I’ve played since ‘06 and I most definitely encountered people like that back then. However I did my warlock quest yesterday with a warrior and it wasn’t an issue at all. He helped me get what I needed and I gave him the items he needed, in my eyes it was a win/win situation since I couldn't do the quest on my own
---
ok.
---
I had to learn to stop caring about that stuff. If the dps want to bitch because I'm not holding aggro I'll just walk out of the dungeon and find a new group in about 2 seconds. They can wait a half hour to find a new tank. You have all the leverage in the world. Use it.
---
Last night, I did a wailing caverns run as tank, never had _any_ aggro due to the shaman pulling like crazy. And just like in vanilla, the hunter got the blame.
---
I f*cking love this game.
---
Thats wicked claw not sharp claw.
---
Yes, unless you play solo
---
Because the difference in value is significant. With boes, you aren't only rolling on the equipped item, you are rolling on the gold value of the item.  If it's still item that is worth 2g on the ah, I couldn't give a shit, but if arcanite reaper plans drop, I'm fucking rolling whether I am a BS or not.
---
There's a market for everything these days XD
---
I gave up on runescape when they went in a bad direction. I stood with wow since Cata all the way to BFA. I even enjoyed wod, but Cata and BFA were the last drop. Ain't giving them shit, since all they care is about money.
---
They're not worth my money neither my time. Ff14 is perfect to fill the modern mmorpg gap that BFA left, any other Linux native or working proton on steam game is enough to fill the rest.
---
As much as I love vanilla, I can't accept blizzard and their shit fuckery with their players. BFA is an empty chore, Diablo immortal is a laughing stock and vanilla is only a way to generate revenue through nostalgia to compensate retail wow failures. 
---
Also Blizzard has done nothing but giving Linux users the middle finger. They chose dx12 and metal for Mac, over vulkan for both (with vulkan molten for Mac out there), they answer shit on forums when they want to regarding Linux users, when it doesn't suit them, they just say that Linux is not supported and you should change OS.
---
Nostalgia bandwagon ain't worth it, neither is any other of their games... They fucked wow, they fucked SC series, Diablo 3 is a dumb down loot shit fest, ow no comments, Activision games and money making models put into blizzard games and oh, remember how classic was made to generate profit based on nostalgia? Blizzard has a treat for tall, WC3 remade! Because remaking a masterpiece is easier than making a sequel or saving an entire line of products
---
Man if they dont fix this theyve lost a sub for sure.
---
Serious question, does PVP cause a loss of pet happiness? ...Because if so, I know what first to target in a fight with a hunter with a rare pet...
---
Hang on to it, once people are past leveling their mains and start making twinks, the price will go through the roof.
---
I’m in the 40s, leveling as shadow with the intent of switching to holy later down the road. I heal dungeons very well and questing is a little better than if I was holy. My tip is come to the dark side :p
---
Don’t level as holy. You can level as Shadow and still heal in dungeons just fine. If you don’t have a wand that will help a shit load too
---
Did you not read what I posted? He made a promise and broke it. With no explanation. That was not fun for me. And also, if this was the only thing that ever happened to me, then yes I would call myself entitled. But, this was like event number 5 out of 5 where either felt betrayed, or was put in a bad situation.
---
 I did offer him money from the beginning.
---
Yikes, that's a long time for it to go unaddressed.
---
Yeah lesser heal rank 3 is my jam.  I renew warlocks because I don’t want to waste my time healing through their life taps.
---
Mages are basically the perfect class in classic and they perform extremely well in raiding and with practice, in PvP too. There are a lot of mages yes, but they are also highly sought after as well. If you got tired of paladin at 50, play mage more; use your paladin as an alt that is able to have maxed professions and level your mage. After all, you don’t have to delete him or anything, right?
---
I always thought its strange that those elevators seem to fly in the air and are not attached to some kind of strings
---
Is there a classic wow warrior discord or subreddit floating around?
---
On the menus before you login there is a button for addons. Go there and uncheck the things you dont need. I turned off a lot of the ugly stuff like the slide bar and kept the functional parts. It's pretty intuitive.
---
I like that you can share your layout with people. It's been a while since, but I started with a layout a guildie had already set up but had to tweak it a little for my setup.
---
Why would you think this?
---
Well you can do that, but the common courtesy exists so that peoole have a chance to get items they want and not make groups toxic.
---
Really fun to search new group members when half group leaves mid dungeons because some ninjad item they dont need
---
I lost electricity yesterday. Once they were up again I had to queue to realm. So me and my girlfriend went to jogging, went to store and made some good food.. first time in couple of weeks.
---
Viable, yes. Optimal, no. You’re most likely going to slap on Nightfall to make the casters in your raid hit the boss harder
---
Hahhahah how wonderful
---
Also, this is still one of the best guides to how to play Durid.
---
https://tagn.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/alamo-teechs-u-2-play-durid/
---
Warlocks have unlimited mana, it'd be a waste not to do this.
---
My leveling team is Bear, Fury, Combat, Destro, Healadin.  The Lock is the puller, and she goes to get the next pack while the current pack is at 20%.  We started Armory at 35, and I have it to where the Paladin drinks only about 3-4 times a run.
---
What’s the secret?  The group needs to understand that your mana bar is their speed limit.  If they pull more groups (and aren’t purposely trying to do that for triple Mage cleave), then they are dramatically slowing the run down by making you waste mana.  Since most classes have mediocre multi-target, the ideal leveling path is an endless stream of mobs one at a time with no breaks.
---
Also, don’t be afraid to abuse the five second rule.  The tank should be able to love for an easy 15 seconds outside of very select packs (or pulls gone wrong).  That means you can full heal in two casts and then get a solid 5-6 seconds of regen before you need to heal again.  If that’s not the case, then your tanks need to start facing mobs and using their debuffs.
---
He's not to dumb, he is saying it is more equitable for everyone to roll and have a chance at the gold.  Why are you to dumb to comprehend that?
---
What a trip
---
Well, I’m going to start off with I’m a tank. And I agree that people are impatient af in dungeons these days. They are too use to retail where they just spam dungeons and ignore questing. I only plan to two dungeons once, maybe twice, to complete quests. Atleast while leveling. Obviously it’s different when trying for pre raid gear, but leveling, it doesn’t matter that much. Quests will give you decent gear and random drops cover the rest.   
---
If I were forming the group, I’d be a bit more selective on character levels. A lot of people try to run a dungeon as soon as they can. They get a ton of misses and resists on skills which makes it hard. Especially the tank. Being a bit more the appropriate level helps more than gear. 
---
If you’re deadset of farming dungeons for all your levels, respeccing isn’t the worst idea, but that will pigeon hole you pretty hard. Wouldn’t recommend it. You should be fine without respeccing until the late game material. 
---
Idk what to tell you aside from that.  I plan to level in the world questing so idc about running out of a dungeon. I tend to just hearth.
---
We had a discussion on Sulfuras in Duskwood about what this game is “about”. Someone was mad that people were tagging mobs and instead of accepting invites to kill things together they’d just kill it themselves. Then someone chimes it that this game must be played cooperatively. Which I don’t agree with. I’m leveling as a heat priest and I don’t agree that this game should be played together every second of everyday. I solo unless you need me to kill anything elite. I just like that better.
---
Gyth resists a shitload and you either have only one healer or one tank. If it's one healer, they're going to oom before you get both gyth and rend down. If it's one tank, drakk won't be much fun if you don't kite, and I don't think a mage could kite him long enough to down the adds, which again, resist a ton. If it's one healer, same problem.
---
It's almost like all it takes is 1
---
&gt; There's no point debating over this, will just have to wait for Blizzard to confirm it. 
---
That is an absolutely terrible argument.  The plethora of proof on the issue is far more useful than "Blizzard confirming it".
---
The actual reason is it doesn’t. It decreases overall time because you have better mana regen by finishing with wand due to the 5 second rule. 
---
But technically it would kill them faster as a crit won’t be wasted on over kill.
---

Oh no no no no no no

/attacktarget btw

That right click unlock addon
---
Was online, literally didn’t hear a single thing about .Org being attacked. Ran into Muhsogny a couple times while levelling. Seemed nice, guess he’s red is dead now
---
Actually, yeah, I do have a pretty good idea about that. Because that was one of the things that was discussed during several Q&amp;A's about maintaining the "Vanilla Experience".
---
i mean, 99.99% of the times i get jumped by a horde, it when i have no mana or health, its never when it's a fair fight

Yea they are

Spam demo roar with big groups ! Just auto and demo roar it generates a lot of threat ! Hope it helps !
---
Why I rolled on a PVE server. Sorry, but world pvp just sucks balls for everyone else except the people doing the ganking.
---
Maybe one DoT, wands can be OP so sometimes better than Shadowbolts. Imp is fine for groups. You can make him passive so he won't go nuts, but there are times you need to be careful, usually involving jumping from ledges as a short cut.
---
Pets won't jump  but run around the long way, and they WILL bring everything with them.
---
Ok Mr. Big Brain I guess *I'm* the one comparing DDoS's to the egregious murder of children and adults, and I don't even *have* Facebook.
---
And you're using statistics from a large city with quite a large amount of crime.
---
Macros are key for making Stance Dancing feel natural.
---
Here's a pretty cool guide: https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-guide-to-warriors-best-addons-and-macros
---
When I leveled a Warrior in a p-server, I macro'ed charge to battle stance, taunt to defensive stance, and intercept to berserker stance. With this, you can double tap one key bind for two actions. This made it so much easier to use abilities effectively without fatiguing them fingers.
---
Generally, you'll want to watch your rage if you don't have the Tactical Mastery to talent. Jumping to another stance to use an ability in combat is worthless if you lose the rage in the process.
---
Exactly, and you can't decide that because you can equip an item that can be sold for significant value, you're somehow entitled to it.  Let the dice decide, and if you win, you can do whatever you want, sell it or equip it.
---
Lol preach brother, look at vitriol in these other responses. Perfectly paints your point
---
I already have a name of this dwarf priest in my mind. I attack on site. I think I need to start writing them down in a notepad though
---
Awwww yissss
---
Was just thinking that.  Should have at least had some kind of rope or something their hanging from
---
Yes, attunement is obviously what I’m eluding to, but I’m curious to know how that might fit in with a long-term plan for content expansion. Will the 99% of Classic players who are unable to clear Naxx 40 be prepared to hang around with little to no prospect for character progression (they’d only be getting new content via new dungeons and zones with no gear upgrades)? Will those players be so inspired by the progression raiders that they’ll stick around and keep plugging away at PUG AQ 40 and Naxx 40 raids for many months or even years on end?
---
So as a Warrior, I should roll on everything cause I can equip it, because it's fun?  
---
Because that is not fun for the other 40 players I'm rolling against, and need that gear more than me.
---
For some reason I half expected you to survive that.
---
"Lol look at my damage while I'm healing" he says after I died for the second time bc he wont step away from the bats in RFK ... who doesent love tanking like that ?
---
Same with OSRS. It’ll change when the player base starts to demand new content. We’ve seen this before in other games and some people really think wow will be different for no good reason
---
Fuck I hate the way oof, rip, and, to a lesser extent, yikes have entered the vernacular these days.  People sound like idiots.
---
Mindblast on CD.
---
It’s been adapted for classic and called ClassicCodex
---
This makes me angry.
---
Considering your maturity level, I've likely been using FreeBSD since before you were born.  
---
But thanks for reinforcing my point that you are terrifyingly immature and the worst sort of representative for a group of people attempting to advocate for expanded UNIX adoption.
---
Yep, exactly.
---
it's not hard with taunt
---
Are you only able to change once? Also what if your username is taken on the server you’re changing to?
---
Tag all the stuff before the people doing the quest can.
---
that's why as a holy pally i punish them with blessing of salvation. No might for you!
---
This is a tired bs thing people say.
---
War: escape artist and stoneform rival hardiness
---
Hunter: Nelf is vastly superior to anything
---
Priest: Dwarf is king, even as shadow I'd argue dwarf is at least on par with troll and UD
---
Mage: Troll might be best here actually, otherwise gnome or UD
---
Warlock: Orc clearly superior
---
Rogue: Escape artist rivals hardiness and WoTF
---
Paladin/Shaman:  can't be compared
---
So in actuality it's perfectly balanced from this point of view.
---
Never gonna be enough warriors as everyone wants tanks and they are some of the best dps...so go for it!
---
Sticking with the analogy, there's multiple types of DDoS attacks.  What the OP described would be more in line with a bandwidth attack.  Based on 20 employees and assuming an 8-hour work day each, that gives 9600 employee minutes to answer calls each day.  Let's assume instead of the employee being told not to hang up, it's really instead that it just takes one minute of the employee's time to determine that it's a prank phone call.  Within the analogy, we could say the prank callers each immediately read off their name, number and address which takes one minute before hanging up.
---
Remember, we have 9600 employee minutes available to answer phones each day.  With 5000 customer calls, that's just under 2 minutes per legitimate customer available to take that call.  However, with 100,000 prank phone calls coming in, each of which take 1 minute to identify as an illegitimate call, we simply don't have employee minutes available to handle the volume of calls.
---
To thwart this kind of attack, you have two options: 1) find a way to identify which phone calls are prank calls, to decrease the amount of time required to handle them and unblock the phone lines or 2) start blocking phone numbers as you identify prank calls.
---
Option 1 is difficult because each caller could recite a different name, different address, different phone number, recite them in different order.  You run the risk of mis-identifying legitimate customers who happen to just start the call the same way the prank callers are and blocking them as well, which harms your business.
---
Option 2 is difficult because you can't be sure that the phone number on the caller ID is an attacker's number.  It could be that the prank caller managed to bug innocent peoples' phones and again, you wind up blocking legitimate customers who can now no longer order pizza when they weren't actually at fault.  But even if you accept the risk, you still have to cycle through all 100,000 prank callers before you can stop the calls entirely.  So either way, you still cannot effectively handle customers that day.  And also, another attack could be done tomorrow using a different set of compromised phones, so all of the phone numbers you blocked today don't help you when tomorrow's prank calls start rolling in.
---
shadowmelt and escape artist sounds pretty good. is it "over all"?
---
Make the poll booth only accessible in-game, by level 60 characters.

Your pet with beastial wrath absolutely crushes mages.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, I’m a WoW noob, what’s a twink item?
---
It’s been one weekend and there are still queues on Stalagg and Faerlina - I suspect more will come this week if the queues remain during peak hours.
---
i never said that, or thought that. use one of the many free options to see old versions of edited posts if you don't believe me.
---
I really depends on your server id say. On our server lots of warriors charge tanking fees to make money because there are a shortage of tanks
---
Good, now burn their world tree!
---
Noice.
---
This is why I don't roll on a "PvP" server.  lol
---
But if it sells you get that back.....
---
Not hard just different, mana managment becomes the main focus point, over get as much Hps as possible like in retail. You can completely over heal an encounter, so sit back and heal as you need and let your mana regen in the mean time.
---
It isn't hard but paladins aren't equipped to do it properly. Warriors and druids can tank raids fine, pallies can't even fucking taunt.
---
I don't get it, why Ty Segall is so popular with mmo players
---
So I would like to run Maraudon, mostly for the scepter, but I would also like/prefer to get as many mara quests done in one run, what lvl do you guys recommend going in at? I am currently level 45, almost 46 mage. What is the level ranges for mobs? If I remember correctly in tbc it was 40-50? 
---
Also if it is best to just do 2 runs, how should I do them? As in should I do everything up to where the scepter teleports me in and then do another run starting from scepter?
---
Eh,  lets say a BiS twink boe rare or epic drops - you would have to be new to equip it over selling it in AH
---
Back in vanilla it was common to roll all need if the item was worth a lot.
---
Yep. Was getting camped by some skull-leveled sweaty horde mage. I'm a level 30 hunter and this guy had a mount and was just chasing me all over Hillsbrad. I know it sounds like a lie, but I actually killed him once. Most of the time if I knew he was coming I could concussive shot and run when he dismounted. I guess I just kept getting lucky that my shots were even hitting him. But everytime that he killed me and I was able to spawn and get away, I reaped my vengeance upon the unfortunate clothies trying to farm bears or w/e other moronic things Hordies do. Eventually he stopped camping me. He probably just got bored, but I like to think that he realized he was causing their suffering and left.
---
his mic is terrible
---
Depends on your definition of viable. It's viable, and sometimes optimal depending on how geared you are compared to what you are fighting.
---
Yea but think of how many pieces of leather you collect on the road to 40. It definitely adds up. Stacks of heavy leather sell for 30s to a vendor.
---
Doesn't a hunter need more butto... oh wait, no, you're a hunter.
---
There doesn't need to be a thread about this every time it happens somewhere, does there?  It's going to happen a lot and it really isn't interesting.
---
Kill the elementals in arathi for the whirlwind axe materials.
---
this \^
---
all your devices and your ISP have to support IPv6 for this to work
---
love the people saying to do BGs when they're not in for months lol
---
Good idea!
---
Definitely take spirit tap, and tell your warrior friend to let you last hit as much as possible so you don't have to drink.
---
Getting the effect 50% of the time is still worth 5 talent points.
---
For PvP, I'd still pick orc for the stun resist.
---
That's where my head was at. Even after all these years not a lot of folks tanking in Bfa and it's easy to get groups.
---
Your friend is retarded and a asshole =/
---
a good way to combat the 5 second rule is to pre-cast, as the mana only stops regen after a succsessful cast, you can roll up the cast bar and cancel without invoking the 5sr
---
"Twinking" in wow refers to stopping the leveling process at 19, 29, 39, 49, or 59 and collecting the best possible gear for their level so they can stomp battlegrounds. Classic BGs dont give xp so they never level up.
---
Really? Everyone I know including myself thinks the opposite, the worst part about being on a pvp server is that it kills questing and is 0 fun while levelling but when you're at 60 you'll appreciate that you went through hell for the world pvp at max lvl.
---
Tauren, easily. 
---
*  5% more total health
---
* 2 sec AoE Stun on a mere 2min cooldown
---
* Hidden extra auto attack range (huge for Shamans who have trouble getting in range as it is).
---
The only thing ORC Shamans got going for them is the stun resist, but your PvP trinket already removes stuns. Blood fury sucks, Axe Spec is almost negligible.
---
Looks like he found it
---
 all your devices and your ISP have to support IPv6 for this to work
---
19 and 29 twinks being the most common.
---
A guildie also noticed that his leader of the pack buff only is applied every second time he has powershifted. So he will only have half uptime on the buff if he powershifts. 
---
Definitely seems like there are some bugs related to using powershifting macros.
---
Vote this to top comment. Makes it at least twice as funny and it was already fucking fantastic!
---
Hunter mostly uses Mana for utility, snaring, kiting, ECT.  You can get 90% of your damage (and on longer fights, the most possible damage for your Mana) by just using Aimed shot and multi -as long as there's no cc to break.  Only need to drink when setting up for cc pulls or for aoe
---
And this is why I love them.
---
If only you were a mage, you can fall and blink before you hit the ground to save yourself. Better than slow-fall and wasting feathers

You realize by telling people this you're only contributing to the state you're complaining about?

Dawg i run linux and you sound like a douche. I agree with what you are saying but homie, the vocabulary and inferred tone from this thread is not the way to go about it
---
oh look, an archaic stallmanite! 
---
time to scoot over boomer, care to remind me the last time BSD was relevant? oh right! when sony stole it, right after apple stole it. (oh its not theft, the bsd license permits it cause they're that desperate for adoption)
---
im not gotta argue about whos the bigger neckbeard, but im honsestly shocked such a classical supporter of opensource software wouldn't whole heatedly agree with at least the sentiment of my statements. 
---
\&gt; the worst sort of representative for a group of people attempting to advocate for expanded UNIX adoption.
---
then why are people like you silent when linux and libre software in general is under threat, or is actively being abused? maybe you're more of a boomer than i thought. 
---
my apologize for being immature, however i'd like to remind you that just because my tone made you grumpy doesnt make my points invalid :)
---
&gt;changes layer
---
I understand how you feel, thats why I always say "can we all need on epic and rare BOEs?" at the start. It feels better to get a BOE you can equip rather than getting one you can sell, probably because then you dont feel like you've wasted money, since its a bonus. In reality its actually more unfair if only those who can use the item gets it, because different classes have different amount of potential rare drops, and groups have varying amounts of people that need a type of gear. If your group got a mage, hunter, feral druid, rogue, and a resto druid then the mage is going to get 3 BOEs by the time everyone else gets a single one. An important thing to mention is that being allowed to need makes it fair for better geared players. 
---
I learned it from firelands trash mob farming, I didn't play in BFA.

You’re a mad man

Cool, then you wait for priest to drink.

That’s what I thought, but in stormwind right now 8 people. That’s horrible!

You might surprise yourself.

If you're on herod, that guys in my guild lol. Hes generally a cool guy tho  lol.

First of all, you are are comparing Runescape to World of Warcraft. Only one of these titles is a Titan in the MMO industry. Only one of those titles is run by a major corporation that is held accountable. The over whelming majority of players that wanted classic are the ones that will sway any opinion on the subject and that majority were the ones demanding the vanilla experience be maintained. OSRS is a spec of sand in comparison.
---
Well the analogy would still hold even if it wasn't fake calls being the issue, but fake orders - say instead of dial tones, it's robots placing fake orders (more in line with a bandwidth attack than a traffic attack).  The pizza place can only make so many pizzas each day based on how big their oven is and how long each pizza takes to make.  Each pizza placed by a prank call, that gets made and then just sits and never gets picked up is time lost to make a pizza for a legitimate customer.
---
So now when you walk into the store, you're told they can't make you a pizza because there's too many orders already placed, so you don't get your pizza today.
---
Guess I’ll finally get to see the cat when we go in there then, haha
---
Why tf attack a French server?! If u wanna get some attention, go for the English ones fucking noob ddoser.
---
Non-mage problems
---
Even though pretty much half of my server plays a warrior everybody is always looking for a tank.
---
I bet there's plenty of people with a high level main and a warlock or priest alt by now.
---
This ring is so good for priest or warlock, especially on a pvp server. It should easily sell for over 100g right now.
---
Personally, I think it could go for over 200g.
---
Hello, i've read everything you said and i want to share my opinion. :)  
---
First about 
---
" **- New dungeons and raids obviously! - new 5 mans have an AI script running them that calculates your average gear level and determines the difficulty based on that. Mobs are spawned less predictably and there are more environmental challenges to complete these. I.e. expect to navigate through dark underwater caverns** "
---
1. I am ok with new dungeons and new raids
---
2. I am not ok with AI scripts to calculate your gear and adapt the difficulty. You know why? because we will endup exactly like BFA is. If the difficulty scales with your gear then you have just made the gear obsolete. People won't feel that they progress anymore. Alot of people feel that their character progress when they do a raid/dungeon faster because their gear is better now. IMO this calculator of difficulty is wrong, and it will diminish the joy of getting new items and becoming more powerful, because if dungeon scales, your item doesn't matter. If i have BIS gear and 4 other players have BIS gear we should be able to pull alot of dungeon mobs without caring.   
---
" **- Level cap stays at 60 (Naxx &amp; some AQ40 gear is weakened to reduce the item level creep and provide some more scope for later raid progression (it also makes end game raids tougher)** "  
---
1. I am ok with the level cap staying at 60  
---
2. I am not ok with gear beeing weakened and reducing the item level provided just so new raid items can be introduced. This is the path that was used for other expansions untill now and it is always a problem. This in my opinion is not how gear should evolve.  
---
3. I will explain my vision about how new gear should be introduced:
---
\- The items from the new raids will have the same item level as Naxx has so the gear difference between new players and players that are playing in the last raid is not infinite even if it is. Let's be real a lvl 60 bis vs a lvl 60 with greens will one shot the greenie.   
---
\- Instead of adding more ilvl to the gear they can create more sets for classes and target specific specs, for example Boomkin, Paladin Retri, Paladin Protection, etc. specs that are not really viable at endgame content. I know everyone can play what they want but usually people won't take a boomkin druid in the raid.  
---
\- Get the debuff limit raised to 32 so other classes can use their spells, ex Affliction Warlock, This will need rebalance over old content so the raids won't be more easier than they are at the moment.
---
\- Add more quest chains like Benediction for other classes, there are alot of story possibilities they can get into, without disrupting the story from TBC WOTLK and so on
---
\- Maybe add new legendaries for classes that can't currently have one, big chain quests but they have to be hard to get, so not everyone and their mom can weild them. Not legion. They need to be on par with other legendaries in terms of difficulty to get them.
---
\- And last, maybe for classes that have good sets already add sets that have other bonuses and which change the playstyle from the set before. 
---
In conclusion the only thing i am not ok with is lowering the gear ilvl, we will end-up like BFA at some point. People have to think like this game will be developed for the next 10 years, not 1-2 years. If we endup with 10 raids in 10 years? what then? if the gear keeps increasing we will just get to legion numbers of millions of damage. So i think it is better to just add new effects for sets and change the style of how the class is played than powering ilvl to gear.
---
" **- revamp cities with improved NPCs, more immersive questlines &amp; facilities** "
---
\- i don't know about you but i am level 40 right now and did all quests on the map and read them all, they have good story most of them, i don't think they really need a revamp, i don't know what you want to feel more immersive, maybe npcs talking more, like they do in BFA. Maybe yeah.   
---
**"  Introduce Level 40 raid tier - you'll have an option to halt your characters level at 39-40 while you complete a new raiding tier. Only players 37-40 are allowed access to these raids. They are aimed at keeping the lower level zones fresh and providing new experiences for players at the lower levels (no plate gear drops to keep tanking fair between different classes). You can either leave your character at level 39-40 or complete these raids and continue back to level 60. "**  
---
\- i don't think this is needed, there are alot of things you can do at 40 no need to create a raid for level 40, alot of spells are not available at 40, people won't bother to stop their characters at 40 when they can go to 60 where everyone knows the endgame is. Only twinks will do those raids. 
---
 
---
In retail it’s not the same at all? So that wouldn’t be my problem.
---
It’s a quest in loch muldan
---
Just got to 21 this morning, I think most people are 15-40
---
According to my census on my server, most people are in between 15 and 35 atm. Many do try a bit, reroll often, and so on.
---
I'm personally 20 atm, the fourth time. :D
---
That might be true, but they are not also the best in Most PvE scenarios. They're both almost useless in PvE. That's what I'm arguing for here. I'm not saying Mages are best in every scenario ever, but rather that they are top 3 in almost any scenario you can be in.
---
2x Lvl 40s, currently leveling priest (Lvl 26) 
---
Hopefully no more rerolls from me
---
You have four auto shots?
---
You are behind the curve yes but that's not a bad thing at all. Lv 33 atm.
---
I heard this story that if you are not a worthy mage you will just see broken village. It's some kind of protection charm to keep all low hocus pocus guys out.
---
Lvl 29, keen to gtf home and get to 30!
---
Hahahaha just like old times!!!
---
Hunters are doing great in dps... Go check out the logs.
---
You are correct and only new players don't understand this concept.   
---
The hive mind down votes in this thread, lol
---
This isn't retail?
---
All because he's heading south? WTF
---
Everything is viable, but yes priests are better healers.
---
But they can't tank and their DPS relevance is fairly limited.
---
Ol Blanchy is awesome and never a queue
---
BETAAAAAAAAA
---
we had a ele sham in sm who kept chain lightening for his first cast. our tank us good but eventually just started letting the dude eat mobs. 
---
dude was doing less dps then out tank, but I'm okay with carrying someone but this guy was pretty toxic as well. whispering our tank like paragraphs. we even asked him to wait to use chain lightening for a bit and he just didn't care.
---
Are you retarded lmao
---
oof I’m literally 17 on my main and I haven’t rerolled once XD
---
In reality this is true. But it's more fun to meme along and admit that horde are basically scum who never fight fair.
---
It’s just funny to me imagining all these people filling their diapers because ppl don’t wait for 2 sunders in wailing caverns as if a mage can’t tank the whole dungeon lol
---
Except literally opening the chest
---
As a priest I would throw them a renew, keeps them stable and fine in dungeons, I don’t really top them off unless it is required for incoming damage. If they are low on mana and health at the same time, I’ll throw them a heal + renew and that keeps them healthy and costs much less mana.
---
But I rolled a mage this time around so I don’t have to baby sit :p
---
Been using this one, it's been good. https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/
---
You as well ;) making the enemy your friend lol.
---
Find someone who will give you bags,  ask here if anyone wants a friend or even roll on my server.   Those starting bags are huge
---
25 currently
---
LoooooL.
---
Just get wine staging and try to run battle net and classic, without the aid of lutris. Some things I prefer running through wine directly and generally work fine. 
---
But yeah, using Linux made e chose what is worth my money and what is not. I contributed / donated to a private vanilla server but don't see myself paying blizzard. The community and those who love wow deserve my money, this travesty blizzard enacts does not.
---
Quickly, you'll fall behind the content everyone and their dog has done 15 years ago!
---
That's not very nice, I do suffer from mental instability
---
As a priest, there is just constantly people to help out, so many rogues and warriors at 40% health fighting mobs by themselves. It's so easy and nice to give them a heal from afar, make them appreciate the Light, and have them be so thankful. 10 seconds for us saves them 40 seconds.
---
Fellow Desi here, using Lowerping on EU brings me down to 120-140 in Pune. I'm using my phone net now, without Lowerping and I get between 180-200 on EU.
---
I also use Arch btw
---
Post Malone and this are both references to basketball player Karl "Mailman" Malone, pretty sure.
---
I had the most delightful interaction yesterday.
---
Me a pretty high level undead shadowpriest riding around STV encounter a onesided battle between a about lvl 30 alliance and a 7+lvl horde. 
---
The ally start to spam a emote which says  "me  lo ve y ou" and the beg emote. And the horde rogue hesitates and asks "I cant kill a guy that says that, right" 
---
After which this scene is played out almost word for word.
---
https://youtu.be/k4pbfT5pupc
---
I disagree, I can train multiple mobs with dots and use aoe to clear using suffering also and that’s better imo.
---
If there’s one tip I can give is always send your pet in first to do the damage get the threat going then start dotting it up, use the taunt when your start pulling a lot of threat etc
---
Honestly one of my favorite parts about classic is being able to tell a noob from a pre-bis guy to an epic raider just by the visuals
---
Warriors look like clowns until they hit Scarlet Monastery and it's great
---
I mean you literally typed "he got 27k subs during the downtime" :D
---
You should get off Reddit then without supervision
---
Hunters are needed for tranq in raids anyway
---
Gz
---
You would equip it for the fight
---
The best at vanilla world pvp uses a lot of weird stuff, you can see it in newer (private server) pvp videos. Reflecting a frostbolt from a geared 60 mage is a big deal afaik.
---
The only classes doing better in general in the raids right now are combat rogue and fury warrior.  Frost has a good showing in rag due to aoe on adds and sheer lack of kills to compare.
---
as soon as I got to 22 I skipped into ashenvale, I like the barrens but its so fucking big!
---
I’ve never heard of it thought of this. This is absolutely brilliant! Well done scumbag! Well done indeed!
---
Used to wait for the zeppelin to leave so I could do this! So fun
---
Should be more like PSA - everyone use your transfer to go come to heartseeker
---
I am being supervised, my doctor is helping me reply to someone making fun of my illness
---
hahahahahaha
---
I think he's joking that the undead dance emote has air guitar in it haha
---
Everyone can use that gear because everyone can sell it and buy better gear.
---
Also if everyone greeds, then the actual ninja is going to get the item and laugh at you for being dumb.
---
Paladin isn't bad and people will group
---
I'm also a teacher but what's stopping you from playing on the weekdays? You know.. **after** work
---
Why are you bringing real life politics into a game, lol. 
---
The issue most people have with Asians or Brazilians playing on NA servers is that everyone speaks their own language. If you want to play a massively MULTIPLAYER online role-playing game where you can't communicate with half the server then feel free to do so, but most people don't. 
---
On EU we specifically have English, German, French, Italian whatever else servers so people can pick what language they want to communicate in. If an English server gets overrun by Italians people are going to be pissed, if an Italian server gets overrun by Germans they're going to be pissed, if a Taiwanese/Chinese server gets overrun by Americans you bet they're going to be pissed.
---
To Be Continued ----&gt;
---
41, i hope to be 60 in 3 weeks
---
Here to confirm. Get stuck logging on to any realm running wine/lutris on Manjaro. Works fine from the same computer on the same network booted to my windows partition though. What gives Blizzard?

Ow
---
The unofficial gay server GAYtiesh.
---
But when a hunter pulls at 130%, if the tank taunts they just multiplied their threat.  That's kind of why hunters have no natural threat modifiers is so they can bounce threat off of say, healers and deliver it to the tank.  Now on some bosses where mechanics like breath and buffets come into play, yeah they should definitely just fd after their first cycle and manage it.  But there's benefits to pulling huge threat in a safe way and bouncing a mob off the tank, snaring it on its way to you and let the tank taunts it for huge snap threat.  And if it doesn't work out there's fd anyways for those messy pulls

27 on my warrior and 28 on my paladin, im honestly surprised ive kept them so close in level
---
We kicked a mage from our guild yesterday because he refused to make water for the priest in our dungeon run. Some people are just selfish thrustbricks.
---
Get over it already. Sound like its the first time you playing games on Internet
---
Agreed, I always let the rogue have it. It’s my policy as the raid/party leader.
---
I was doing quest in Desolace. One rogue invited me for kill x mobs quest. Ok there I was three mobs on me and sitting on bear form killing them. Rogue pulled 2 mobs and died. He just said that I should've healed him, left group and ignored me.
---
I bet that with that attitude he soon has no friends on our server..
---
Ah I see. Thank you for this info
---
I think I’ll split it in half and do one run up to scepter and then do another run later from scepter onwards.
---
As a tank since Vanilla: aggro is a crappy mechanic. To a good group it's just an irrelevant roadblock to clear-speed and to a bad group it destroys the run. A tank's job should be damage mitigation, pulling, mob positioning, survival, interrupts and CC through their class' mechanics. There is no challenge in just doing enough damage to out-aggro your dps.
---
Fighting for aggro means you're playing against your team, not with it. To competent tank this means it's just a gear check or pure RNG (parry/miss/resist), which can ruin a pull through no fault of the tank or the dps.
---
I was glad when threat was boosted, because they could focus on other, actually fulfilling, tank gameplay.
---
On that note: screw Classic's absurd insistence on unavoidable aggro-drop mechanics. I had a perfectly good time as a paladin tank until they started adding this crappy "lol dude just taunt, lmao"-crap to every other boss.
---
Mountain Dew has water in it.
---
I actually just thought it up a few days ago, being the highest level rogue in my guild, and giving away lots of greens people seem to trust me.
---
I’ll get an epic eventually.
---
It’s in the mail...
---
Yup, still WOW51900328
---
I did in the lvl 60 build but in the 40 build suppose I could drop the 2 points into frost warding and put that into frost bolt instead. The other 3 points would have to wait though.
---
Imp frost bolt is only a 3% dps increase per point and everything above that is much more impactful per point.
---
I see what you're doing and I'd like to participate
---
I promise you it happened I just need to find it, remind me in a day.
---
And it's not going to get better by you saying shit like this, however if you didn't say anything then it might change.
---
Oh can you only attack people your same level in battlegrounds?
---
its not that its a personal attack, its that its a total unabashed disregard for linux users, and again i get it, we're not supported, but this type of behavior is consistent and actually goes against market research regarding the linux userbase's size and monetary influence (in general more adults with more money use linux, a lot of those people are nerds who like games)  
---
this on top of microsoft trying to fuck with the kernel, on top of stallman making a fool of him self, it just saps a persons hope.  
---
i will give credit to lurtis, apparently several devs are already working on spoofing the headers- the only issue is that if blizz ever found out you were spoofing headers and could prove a header-host discrepancy, you'd get outright banned- so the bandaid fix could actually lead to more of an issue. 
---
and to go off your point, we're a vast minority for sure in regards to the classic wow playerbase, however this could also mean that they just wont change it back, \*because\* we're so small. my anger comes from letting my self get abused again. i apologize (sincerely) for being such a douche as one person put it, i hope you can see it as honest fear for my passion rather than me simply being a unintelligible dick head.

---
You have to consider who is actually 60 at this point. It's going to be people who are playing very hardcore, a lot of whom were avid private server players.
---
MC is easy enough that it will be pugged with casuals, though.
---
It’s like BAKED into my mind that when I see a mob even look at me I just start immediately running toward the tank. 
---
Months of getting yelled at the first time around did that....
---
I just added the "in total" in the newer edit. Before that I had

&gt; He literally got to 27k subs during yesterday's DDOS...
---
World PVP at mid-levels is the absolute best as long as there aren't a bunch of high levels around to tilt the balance. I'd actually really love to see some kind of ladder server where they start with a low level cap and raise it every week or two. Give some kind of incentive for world pvp after you hit that level cap.
---
Nearly 45, I took like 2 days off to play other stuff. 
---
But now the pack has caught up and i'm in trouble lol
---
Well, no, you clearly knew the meaning they used it in, you're just trying to appear more intelligent or something and be an ass.     
---
&amp; If you can't tell the context in which it's used in, then you need to learn how to infer and pick up on things more.    
---
and to your " When people use literally the wrong way, it literally takes away the meaning of the actual word. "  
---
Who cares? Language changes, and clearly this is a language change that I've seen on the internet and in real life for like 5-10 years now. Literally is often used in hyperbole and it's easy to tell what they're trying to say/convey. They obviously don't mean literally literally.   
---
:)
---
And disconnecting constantly isn’t a problem?
---
Jumping through a lot of stupid hoops here in your attempt to be right.
---
Turtles with no shells...
---
Is there a reference post or something im missing here?
---
I mean, ill always appreciate a badass Alliance player defending other Alliance players...i just assume im missing out on a reference here lol
---
Wait how is the item being ninja'd if everyone rolls need and gets an equal chance at it?
---
One of the nice things about being a mage is after you see someone on the other faction fight and win a hard fight against NPCs, you can sheep them back to full.
---
Mate this is me at times! haha I work in a High school and my character on retail is older then all these kids. It's insane and still blows mind mind every-now and then
---
I (alliance) tried to explain to other horde players that another alliance guy just killed an afk horde player.
---
I was like, /question OtherHordePlayer, /point Deadguy, /point Allianceguy, /chicken Allianceguy, /attacktarget Allianceguy.
---
Responds was a friendly /wave and a moving along. "Awwwww looook at this cute little gnome!" :| I felt like a diplomat for a second.
---
Prat 3.0
---
you're not wrong, a decent tank set for druid would be amazing, it doesn't even need too much, just some crit protection or something.
---
What a petty little chicken 😌
---
so, after it was mentioned multiple times within this thread: What IS a MC pug? :D
---
39 on rogue main and 28 on priest alt.
---
Hated waiting around for tanks and healers so my bro and I rerolled, having a blast!
---
In most private servers I raided every raid in the game just by pugging in town rather than having some dedicated tryhard guild or something. Worked out well.
---
Listen dude if you want to just be pedantic, go ahead. That doesn't change my view.
---
Leveled in bc to lk on my hpally on my wacom. Look back on it and wonder how i did that. Went mouse didnt go back
---
As a priest this bullshit makes my life harder too. Not only because of no time to drink, but because I wouldn't even have to drink if these dipshits weren't making me heal the entire group the whole time.
---
14war, 12rogue, 18mage then 18priest. I'm sticking with priest :)

yes, and i've heard the argument and its total bogus

someone whos really smart needs to explain to me why linux needs an exfat kernel module.
---
Not enough people to even tell me that lol
---
I've bound my stances depending on the stance I'm in. In battle stance my side mouse key switches to berserker stance, clicked with shift it switches to defensive. Other way around for berserker stance. In defensive the click switches to battle stance and shift click to berserker.
---
For me it works great.
---
And I'm switching alot. More since I've gotten whirlwind.
---
In addition I've got a weapon switching macro with useaction (was the easiest solution somehow). But this doesn't work in combat right now.
---
PS: Spend 20 bucks for a mouse that got more than two buttons, it's worth it.
---
All those cloud services do is shift the bottleneck somewhere else. Generally those DDOS mitigation services can handle a lot of requests and will use special algorithms to drop un-authentic traffic. Using my home connection, I could probably do a dos attack on a smaller company that uses a dsl connection as I currently have a fibre connection. DDOS protection might be useful in this circumstance as it stops script kiddies doing dos attacks directly.
---
However, the DDOS attack Blizzard is currently dealing with is obviously large enough to bring down a routing channel for an ISP. I doubt that there would be many DDOS Protection services that wouldn't fall over in this circumstance.
---
Creating your character, huh? Some of us have jobs and can't play all day. I'm still typing in my password.
---
If they ever made one, it'd probably look more like retail than classic
---
Or private server.
---
You can think what you want.  Next time don't make claims about games you know nothing about. 
---
I'm playing Classic and Retail.  Both are simply products of their time.
---
Is maraudon farming possible? Ie is there a fast way to reset the instance and be at the entrance?
---
Just about 29, one bar away
---
We need PvAll relams when you can attack (and be attacked) anyone including members of your own faction. I would play this until the cows come home.
---
This will change when the honor system is implemented.
---
this is an entirely different (meaning mix and matched) group of devs under a totally different lead, plus classic was blizzards panic button, they cant take risks like under the table support.
---
Clique has an update for classic! Used it today.  :)
---
U said they got two months of ur money. That's where I got the number, from u
---
You could sell this layer as a "Travel" layer, so people could run through zones without the fear of dying.

Damn that was satisfying! But where is the audio and screaming?😉

Spices up the leveling experience.

What add-on are you using for unit frames?
---
they can add bridges idiot
---
37 went hard for the first week of launch now I’m at a crawl

Needled it
---
Imagine being this naive.
---
2 mouse buttons plus 2 from scroll up and scroll down combined with shift/Carl modifiers for those 4 gives you plenty of mouse binds
---
You're full of shit and literally making your own situation worse.
---
I'm sorry you had to wait but this is pissing in your own sink.
---
OK, yeah, I changed the name and didn't have issues. Although I was kind a tempted to name it the same since I tried with a new character and the name was available, so it wasn't put on any "banned names list" at least right away.
---
Troll alert
---
Every time I got attacked they waited till I am already in combat with one or more tough mobs. I applaud them for their bravery and just die to continue questing
---
Stay clear of the road in this quest. Hug the mountain ridge to the east and you'll be fine!
---
They will probably reserve something. It's the reward for spending hours in cities inspecting people. Eventually we'll start seeing a lot of gbid runs instead.
---
tbh as a mage you are very capable of living through aggroing 15+ mobs for a very long time
---
No, the buttom line is you're contributing to the problem.
---
Anything where you are spamming trade or /4 for more members is a pug pretty much. If you are 4/5 guild for a dungeon you could call it a guild run. or a raid with like 20 core members.
---
Also in ZG :)

CRAWLINGGGG IN MY SKINNNN

oh duh, well i paid for a month when name registrataion came out (fell for that trap) and then i recently paid for september, so thats two months- my billing cycle refreshes in october- i wont be renewing it.

The death of a gnome is hardly tragic to be honest
---
Fuck trump
---
ONE BREATH
---
Same happened to me in Ashenvale, tho it was a treant patrol who got me lol :D
---
Also what up with that mounted alliance patrol in Barrens? Saw it only once. Is it a permanent thing?
---
No kick feature in classic so if you’re party leader you’re unkickable
---
Nope, I actually love that it might stay as it is. Why? Because I can level alts, I can take my time exploring, doing professions and eventually levelling alliance which I've never done before. I don't want to be rushed out of classic again.
---
Same
---
If they don't do it then it will be a disaster. Even though I prefer TBC I will quit WoW classic in a heartbeat if they kill off original classic.
---
Because if they can classic then I will mean that our gameplay is not safe and Blizz will continue on their way toward butchering it. We always have to have a fallback to keep them honest.
---
Just be aware that you need to be level 35 to get fishing past 225
---
The people who are 60 now are anything but casual though. I suspect the pugs will be worse and worse as more casuals hit 60. But that's also when guilds can actually make their own MC runs instead of doing joint/pug runs like it is now.
---
Is rather be getting unruly when drinking Truly.
---
Auctionator is on twitch, you just have to change the dropdown from classic to retail, then click into auctionator, before pressing install change it back to classic, then press install and you're good to go.
---
12, 11, 7, 9, 1, 3, 4

Well that wasn’t very clear tbh. Sounded more like you thought you might be completely fucked.

The difference will hardly be noticeable, the racial factor is massively blown out of proportion.

Can you please stop acting like a spoiled brat? (ref. your other comments) You're ruining the community's image for everyone. You dont educate people by being condescending. Go back to /g/, where behaviour like this is a joke and should not taken seriously.
---
Because of *Reasons* im jumping ship from windows when they stop supporting windows 7. That's the plan at least. Im really happy about classic being available for linux users, didn't know that.
---
Magic is murder.
---
I am thinking he wanted you to buff him. Are you playing a priest/mage/paladin?
---
for classic: No; palas + shamans are healers only, unless your guild permits otherwise.
---
This is a blizzard support issue, not Classic.
---
Oh nooooo one zone, how horrible.

You can turn it on in the options. One of the boxes under the floating combat text section.

You need to activate it in Scrolling Combat text.

Interface is Elvui (Action Bars, Map, Unit Frame, Nameplate, Chat). DPS meter is Details (embedded into Elvui) and Threat Meter is Classic Threat Meter.

Where did that recipe drop for you??
---
Bosses are immune to taunt anyways. Only the earth elementals who drop threat and maybe Garr's adds require taunt. 
---
Prot paladins have many problems but I wouldn't say taunt is one of them.
---
Everyone is so mad, prolly because they made the same mistake as I did. Just re roll on another realm like I was forced to do
---
Uploading some of my data from Incendius Alliance I've been collecting over the last few days!

This is hilarious. Horde literally has a zeppelin coming to STV directly from your Capital city. Alliance doesn't even have a flight path to STV, literally have to fly to duskwood and run across the whole zone. STV for me is 6 to 1 Horde

Shamans are better than Paladins

It'd be awesome if you had the 5s marked off too. But this is great.

Buying gf
---
Idk, I'd like more elaboration. I'm dusting off my combinatorics memory...
---
For the "two matching rolls" out of five if you only have two people the likelihood of an exact match is 1/100. So it should be higher for five people.
---
Lets see... combinatorics probability is something like "choosing the number of specified outcomes divided by the overall possible outcomes."
---
So it's not clear to me actually that permutations or combinations are appropriate since you don't actually end up excluding any rolls. I.e. for a combination lock with four digits, you have 10,000 possibilities. 0000-9999. When you roll in WoW, you don't exclude the previous roll's number, unlike with cards and the lottery.
---
So, for five people there are 100^5 total combinations (as with a 10 digit lock, you have 10^4 combinations). 100^5=10^10, or 10 billion different possibilities for a group of five people.
---
So, you want the probability that at least two people share the same roll out of five. So, you need the number of instances in which two rolls are the same and divide that by 100^5 to achieve the probability.
---
So, how many instances are there where at least two rolls are the same? This is where combinations can now come into play, but it's not "5 choose 2."
---
No, you actually need to calculate the number of instances where ALL numbers are different and then subtract that number from 1 to get the number of instances where the numbers are the same. So, you actually don't use a combination - you use a permutation. The probability that all numbers are different IS in fact exclusive, so permutations are appropriate. So, someone rolls 99, now no one can roll 99 if we're counting the number of ways that someone will not roll the same number. So, its 100*99*98*97*96=100P5 (100 choose 5, order does matter).
---
So, the probability that no one rolls the same number is 100P5/100^5=9,034,502,400/10,000,000=90.35%. So, the probability that at least one person rolls the same number is 9.65%.
---
From there you can apply the same logic to the remaining people since we've not actually defined anything about the remaining numbers and then you do an "and" calculation. So, same logic with three people:
---
100P3/100^3=970,200/1,000,000=97.02%, so the probability that at least one person out of the remaining three rolls the same number is 2.98%.
---
"And" probability is the simple case of probability that most people are familiar with here. So, .0965*.0298=0.0028757~.29%. So, actually the probability of this happening (not counting two exact rolls in a row, just two people getting the exact same roll in the same group) is approximately 1/348.
---
Thrall, meet Garrosh.

Yea I agree, they used to drive me nuts on my undead warlock in Vanilla. Hammer, heal, bubble, heal to full, hammer, heal.

Sometimes i ninja that mokk gorilla while the ally are busy fighting the adds. Sometimes i save that poor human warrior who accidentally pulled an extra pirate and is now fooked. Sometimes I'm in kitty stealth doing an escort in dustwallow marsh and a low level group runs past me....with their warlock lagging behind....who stops to investigate the escort mob seemingly by himself...just to get ravaged crit one shot followed by a sprint away before his party can

Last week I had 18 (!) crafts of a grinding stone before getting a point, it was also yellow. I think when you get close to a "breakpoint" of some sort, like the last points before reaching the new proficiency in the profession, or even the last few points before the specific recipe turns green - you get less chance to get a skill point, noticed it several times.. also when I was reaching the skill level for the next set of recipes to become available, yellow recipes suddenly stop giving points for 5+ crafts when seconds before they were popping every single craft. I also noticed that when the recipe switches to green - for the first several crafts you get a high chance to get a point even at green so I always wait to get another 4-5 skill level at green before switching to the new crafting recipe.
---
oh that's interesting.  Could use a similar macro for turning on and off Claw autocast.  I might have to try that, thanks!

Well I have made quite a few characters that are sitting around level 15 so I’m not high.
---
I’ve settled on a rogue though, human with swords. I buy a new green from the AH every 5 levels or so and I do notice quite a difference in my dps but my money stack isn’t going up because of it

I thought he was calling him a ladder. You go up and down.
---
Haha I soloed the Champion in Mash (level 45 or something) was about to die when 3 level 30 priest showed up and healed me like we was doing Onyxia
---
Unfortunately your memory doesn't serve you well in this case. A release with no decent/big content to kick things off would've been even more disastrous for Blizz at the time, had they not included them at launch.
---
Again, being paralyzed by thinking of edge case outliers. 
---
&gt;his internet went out, he spilled his drink on his kb, or he overdosed on his ritalin
---
Now you're reaching for straws. It's quite clear when someone's unresponsive or something went wrong irl and we happily wait as we know life happens.  But to continually hedge against that negligible level of risk by running at an overly cautious rate loll??
---
Dude even if he did DC we'll get through the mob and then we'll surely need to eat, drink and regroup. 
---
You're really just personifying the scared tank approach we're advocating against. Our point is you don't need to be. There isn't this astronomical increase in wipe likelihood by dialing dungeon pacing from a 3 to a 6 assuming 1 to 10 scale.
---
Are you named after the new tool track?
---
No no. Tank first. You take care of me. I take care of you
---
I’ve ran WC with a shaman tank. Was the most fun I had running WC tbh. I play a mage and my Polymorph was super useful. And we got through it no problem.

Parkour!!

I had this exact scenario play out about an hour ago. The wings. We're too tall, and the wings keep us from getting close enough to make the jump.

Engineering is required for high end pvp/pve.

Mining to pair with it or herb if you want best gathering proff for gold making
---
The server time itself isn't so much of a concern as the ping. On an EST Server I get about 25 ping, on a PST; it comes closer to 70.
---
I have found that playing both makes me appreciate each one. Classic raid scene is a bunch of simple encounters that can be essentially zerged, retail raid scene has mechanics to learn and a real story to uncover and participate in. Retail has more races and class options as well as a ton of quality of life changes. 
---
Classic has a level of immersion and connection with a community and a character unmatched by retail. Those are really the only clear advantages but they’re the reason most people play mmos. 
---
My advice: play classic until you hit 60. There’s nothing like that sense of accomplishment. Then play around on retail and use your 110 boost after doing that for a bit.
---
“It’s a team game” he says as he screeches anytime someone does something that isn’t exactly what he wants.
---
At Low lvl shamans can tank I’ve seen it before it just takes more time. But not everyone is willing to go slow some people just want to rush
---
I guarantee we get TBC at least.
---
Tbh the only time I've had people attack me is when they vastly outlevel or outnumber me. So I just ignore them so they don't get their little fuccboi victory.
---
So does this mean that, for example, Deadmines drops gear levels 17-24?
---
Whatever you do don't sell the nightfins yet! They will be worth 10 times more in a few months.
---
Just kill the spiders in swamp of sorrows instead. At first the low level spiders and later on the green lvl 40+ spiders in the southeast. The greys and the spider silk gives you a good amount of silver. Got around 5g a hour as warrior
---
That’s what she said.
---
I've stuck with boar and the charge has saved my ass in PVP scenerios enough to where it's been worth it. Cat/Owl/Wind Serpent might be better for strictly leveling purposes on a PVE server.
---
Yeah this is what I'm talking about. Now people talk like alpha MAY be out this year, or early next year. If the alpha has been delayed that long it makes me wonder how long alpha to actual release will be.
---
Also it really hurts an MMO when tons of people have been playing early stages openly before it ever fully releases. I really don't think MMOs of all games should be accessible until betas close to release.
---
&gt; Does the shield make up for leather???
---
Rogues can off-tank in the deadmines pretty decently.
---
Im level 35 playing 2 hours a day. I'm pretty much behind average too. Getting hard to find a dungeon group

Practically, playing on linux _should_ still work (at least it did yesterday, using lutris and wine).
---
Would you look at that, multiple week 1 mc clears, classic content is still a joke and Much easier then private servers (which also were easy).
---
My wrist, my wrist. My wrist is on fire! We dont have no water and the healers fucking oom!
---
No, Blizzard is apparently blocking all linux clients now to try to block the DDOS attacks.  No word yet on what they're planning to do to fix it.
---
It took layering breaking for there to be epic world PvP.
---
&gt; If they don’t I call guildies
---
And then they call guildies and now pvp is happening.
---
Gotta poke the hive to get some pvp going.
---
Trust me, enjoy the actual pvp now before all wpvp devolves into camping flightmasters for honor.
---
I’ve paid probably a gold in rez because a friend has jumped off trying to catch up and has died in thousand needles lmao

Fellow Skullflame reporting in

Or just not play this outdated poorly managed and GM’d “game” I honestly don’t understand why people came back in droves to play vanilla again. Get a life.
---
Currently taking Tailoring &amp; Enchanting. Is it okay to drop lv.100 enchanting for skinning? Even though I only learn needed skill for leveling, I'm just poor af. So I think of taking skinning for more income by vendoring the skinning mats.
---
Can you explain why being human makes mobs effectively a level lower?
---
Depends on realm's community. I dont have the same experience.
---
When WOTLK came out Dalaran was the coolest city ever.
---
Ah, those experiences are great. We had a mage earlier today to lazy to walk to Scarlet Monastry from Undercity because we had a warlock. Who was in Undercity just like the mage.
---
Weapon stats are useless. You just want stat buffs. Weapons are most useless on druids.
---
That's exactly how much you should have. Op isn't skinning or killing as much has he should or has got super unlucky never getting greens to vendor.
---
Just get an AH addon, and sell anything and anything that vendors for less than AH. Otherwise just vendoring everything should cover it.
---
if you are playing them without interactions then I've seen people do it and not have any issues, if you are using the character to grief opposing faction players after being ganked or something then you can get into trouble.
---
Ok bud. I'm not mad, but I don't expect someone who uses the word "triggered" to be able to understand emotion through text.
---
I get that feeling every now and then. I've always played PvP.
---
I just don't have the patience for STV anymore of I'm on a PvP server.
---
OMG, that is the stuff of nightmares! Ignore that I already get vertigo when I look over a cliff in WoW, just the timing that was needed  is crazy good. Well done sir!
---
What’s the difference between the free transfer and what this guy is asking about? Sorry, I’m a noob
---
I mean I always do, and everyone is always fine with it.
---
"Guys, need on all boe, yeah? Had some ninjas recently" and everyone goes on with the dungeon because its the smart thing to do.
---
What a dick
---
15, due to having virtually no time to play between work, studying and maintaining interpersonal relationships. Had way more time to kill 15 years ago...
---
There’s probably about a million posts about this already but blizz is getting DDoS’d and everyone is having problems
---
Yeah they turned it off because of the DDoS stuff going on
---
Are those floating dmg numbers in elvui?  I just started using it today and wasted like 2 hours playing with settings.
---
Well if everyone greeds on it then it will get ninja'd.
---
Who is the victim in the scenario that everyone rolls need on it?
---
I'd say it's 20g from that level to 40 give or take 5g a level minimum
---
The free transfer is for if you’re in overpopulated servers. I’m assuming this guy is on a med-low pop server but has friends on a different one. In retail you can pay like $20 for a server transfer.
---
Mobs hit like wet noodles on Classic compared to pservers. Almost makes it boring to do them.
---
OK..?
---
I had the same. I was expecting to have my nostalfia glasses broken, but imo classic is so much better than retail. Even the inconvenience of all the walking doesn't bother me. 
---
I love WoW again and looking forward to playing every day.
---
Weapon skill
---
Yeah I keep getting the same problem
---
Nah, best way after that is macro every spell to target party member 1-5, saves a keyboard press and is on par with mouseover healing in terms of speed.
---
Yes!! I’m glad someone picked up on that instead of claiming his helmet is hidden haha
---
I love this so much

Lul, i started the day servers went live in europe, no idea what you are talking about. Why are you argueing something thats easily disproved by googling? Go cry somewhere else retard.
---
As far as my experience has been its been the opposite, I can soak more straight up damage than a warrior, but I can't jold group aggro half as well, and if something crits me, I can't do fuck all about it except hope that heals come off in time right now at Lv24.
---
How do you zoom out so much?
---
i saw that but a friend of mine is having no trouble at all and we both live in the same area and have the same internet provider.
---
I MTd in wotlk and it was already a non issue. Tclap and tab targeting was enough to hold everything
---
These people are degens, just ignore and move on friend. Enjoy classic. :)

Early on it's important to consider the cost of mail. Yes it sounds like a joke. Be each stack of something costs 30 copper. Whether you mail 1 item or a full stack. It's 30 copper. That can add up if you only have 5 gold to your name.
---
Sadly no. I’d try googling “The Prestige free stream” or the sort. Lots of places have free streaming, just ctrl+w the pop ups.
---
A linear classic expansion would basically be extra raids for only the most hardcore players. The majority of players would be forced to just watch videos of it. You have to remember due to the game being gear dependent, every tier increase, you are shrinking down the available player base to enjoy the new content. So if we go into tier 4 or even tier 5 raids in classic, how many players will get to those points? From a business standpoint, I doubt Blizzard would spend the amount of money it takes to design new content strictly for a significantly smaller minority of the player base. The only way to incorporate more players would be to create a means of getting "catchup" gear. This then would basically make all pre Naxx content pointless outside a possible attunement which being geared up already would just be a time sink over a challenge. If they make Naxx and before pointless, they are breaking any linear need and might as well make a level 70 expansion separate TBC.
---
Just click the dropdown
---
Is it possible, yes.... Cisco equipment and alike have very good deep packet inspection nowadays.... but It's also unlikely. 
---
The header data would "maybe" get round the block...it might not. But the game still knows its running on Wine and Linux, the wow client has hooks to detect it for anti-cheat purposes. So Blizzard still knows your linux, and your not modifying the memory or program to hide that fact, only the network traffic.
---
And frankly, your traffic gets modified alot in network transit. Between NAT layers from your LAN, ISP, and Level 3 ISP .... reroutes from the backbone routers (run a traceroute to see it in person) a packet header is messed with alot before it reaches the server (headers are like the stamp and address on an envelope ... its not the contents of the letter thats change, just gets rerouted or NAT'd alot). 
---
So far I haven't got a working test yet...hopeful but getting drunker the more i work with OpenVPN
---
And the latter is a mobile game. Change my mind.
---
Getting 130ms from Japan when playing on Yojamba
---
Racing for what? Take your time. Raids are not going anywhere. I dont have the time to level as fast as 15 years ago. I have kids and a very time consuming job now. It will take me month to see the first raid.
---
"Insane".... have you seen the math? Also spirit doesn't provide in combat hp regeneration (unless your a troll). Higher spirit wipes of like 2-4s of recovery during normal recovery, per mob. It's pretty big over thousands of mobs, but killing a mob 2-4s faster is still better.
---
Please read on what a DDoS is please.
---
Tanking is much more fun on retail sadly that doesn't make up for the rest of the game
---
Completely agree.    For me all those inconveniences make the game better.   overcoming that low drop rate, or traveling a long time for that one quest, or getting a bad pug for Dungeon.   When you do get the result you want  It feel like a win.
---
Idk, been 5 pull spam clearing sm like it retail
---
Is this something they did for retail that we can reasonably expect for the future?
---
Dungeons drop gear for the level range in which they're suited for.
---
In the same vein, it's worth like $100 today, or maybe $15 in a month.
---
apparently it does. truth is, shamans can tank pretty much any 5-man dungeon.
---
Your gear could suck. Also gnomer at 30 seems early. So maybe mobs are too high a level too.
---
This is for general experience gain and is more a guide than hard limits.  For instance, the gear drops in Deadmines have required levels of 15-19.  If you're at the lower extreme, you'll have a hard time.  If you're at the upper extreme, the dungeon should be easy and you likely wont get a ton of exp (although some)
---
Now join us for real
---
I'm boarding a flight, right now I don't have the time. I did a quick search but didn't find anything so I posted. I was just pointing out that it probably had been posted, so please don't put me on blast. 
---
But some people just can't kind
---
I seem to remember being to mouse over parts of my character screen and seeing more details, like what my amount of spirit does, or what my melee crit % is.    
---
      
---
Did they not add that in until an expansion, or am I dumb and just not seeing the option for it in the menu?
---
Like they told you it might take a while to process but they let you play already. Later it failed to charge so they removed the subscription.
---
&gt;after every encounter I was out of mana
---
Welcome to being a mage! The consolation is that you can make your own food and drinks.
---
Nah, you think they can't mess with other mages that try blinking in by putting them in a micro-world that appears to be flat and empty? All part of the plan.
---
That was my experience too, but a few people in barrens chat (not trolls, seemingly normal people) were claiming 25+ zhevra for all four hooves. Seems like it might just be the *really* unlucky people making it memorable.
---
It's an escort from Maestra's Post in Ashenvale to Darkshore

THANK YOU
---
Currently, the rotation is primarily casting frostbolt unless there's 3+ targets. The build outlined above has no shatter, so you can't really frost nova+cone of cold for some quick aoe burst damage. I have shatter in my build, so i line up novas with cone of cold into arcane explosions for some guaranteed (50%) extra crit damage.
---
In dungeons, I'm pretty much drinking every pull as well. It's normal for a mage to do so. You can try to manage your mana a bit more between pulls, wanding if you don't think you'll get another frostbolt in before the mob dies. Drinking before a pull until your tank gets enough aggro also helps manage your mana instead of standing around doing nothing and waiting.
---
In my opinion, start with frostbolts on the main kill target and once tank has enough aggro, then you cast cone of cold into blizzard. This will help avoid pulling aggro during pulls and keep your dps up. 
---
I've played a mage since BC, so if you're still unsure about things, feel free to throw questions my way :)
---
No its still wrong. You dont need to buy bfa to play the game
---
34
---
The most telling part about STV is that you see lvl 28-32 Horde players all the time but most Alliance people you'll run into are 35+ because they know what's going to happen to them if they're lower level.
---
In my opinion people like that should just get removed. If they're not willing to help themselves then fuck 'em.
---
Has nothing about being pro/anti MAGA... Chinese players in MMO's is a documented thing, it's not necessarily bad (The gaming culture in China has improved slightly but still brings a higher tendency to see things like botting and gold sales as acceptable). A great example is EVE Online, with a recent high influx of chinese groups into the game from the chinese server resulting in an increase in botting.
---
you dont need to but the game. Poster is wrong
---
even worth buying blues. people are still selling them for 1-5g, if you can manage without that for 2-3 months, its big money.
---
I had a rogue leave our Wailing Caverns party, while everyone - INCLUDING THE ROGUE - was at the front because, and check this...he wasn't the only leather wearing guy in the group. He wanted all the leather drops.
---
DUDE! You're lvl 20. There are 3 other classes that wear leather. What did you expect?
---
Also, funnily enough, it mostly dropped mail for me ;)
---
I introduce myself as "huntard" every time I'm responding to a "LFM". They know what they're getting.

Only a small handful of realms have queues. The rest are full of people but not enough to cause a queue.

Just play on a realm that isn't full.

I think he meant arcane explosion

Well.

That's awesome! I think i'll do the same :)

i've never played wow before last week and my first character is an orc warrior in classic. STRENGTH AND HONOR
---
Some people just wanna get where they're going, some just wanna ruin your day. 
---
Just be on guard for the latter - even if you can't kill them, you can still escape them.
---
I dont know why your being so needlessly argumentative but you have contributed literally nothing with it. So it's a bit ironic dont you think.
---
i feel like you have +12 in jackassery in real life
---
Haha, that's fair. I usually play it super safe until I get a feel of the tank and heal.
---
/equipslot 16 is for main hands
---
/equipslot 17 is for off hands
---
Just to clarify
---
I wouldn't mind a hard core mode and/or heroic dungeons.
---
Have played Mage for years including back in Vanilla and BC. This is my exact experience I can kill like warriors or rogues, but get me near a lock or hunter I turn to spaghetti.
---
All you need is a sub to play classic.
---
Level 21 lock bb
---
Send some to me please. I'm starving and the vending machine at work is empty.
---
Hahahah, you are a kind and honest soul.
---
During peak hours. Like 5 to 10 pm you might have a queue on heavy pop servers. Lower servers i dont think have a huge queue. 
---
Fairbanks has queues for like an hour? 
---
You can still join all servers.
---
Queues are Only on a few servers now. I'm too lazy to count. But probably around 30ish servers.
---
Conflag isn't for raiding. In raids you'll spam shadow bolts.

Dude is surrounded by horde, temporarily safe in his ice block. When it runs out, he's dead. But a MUCH higher level friendly warrior is about to utterly wreck all the horde and save him. It's goddamn epic.
---
Do most people in the end game look for +hit gear rather then +weapon skill to reach the cap?

Im more interested in that former gaang member. He looks dapper as fuck.

Oh god i should have gone with 3 hookers instead of 4

WOW, great work!

---
Hey is simply told the kid to google what a DDoS was with please and he was the one who told me to fuck off so. Yeah I get to be this way. For fun.
---
Do not worry about your hit rate until 50+ maybe even 60. 
---
Pre 50 whatever your hit rate is should be good.
---
Yikes kid the entire premise for this discussion stemmed from my comment --- when tanks aren't pulling with near full mana and HP across the board.
---
Nice strawman to insist we've been talking about whether a priest should be pulling for the tank when they're pacing is on point. Omegalul
---
So I lob it back to you and call it quits for the night.

&gt;I don't know where you're getting that

Earlier today I stun locked a warrior till he drowned off the coast in Desolace.
---
Weapon *damage* is useless. What you're looking for is stats and only stats.
---
Warrior without a mount ....wishing good luck to the people waiting for you to run in dungeons xD
---
I feel you man. I’m only level 40 on my hunter but I have done a lot of dungeon runs and barely had any issues.
---
No they won't if you run a 3 mage set up
---
I did a RFC run, where at the bottom of the first slope there are two groups of troggs. I marked one group so they know which one to kill first, and the fucking hunter pulls the other.
---
Being the nice tank I am I didn't let him die. But also, before helping him, I wrote "I'll let you die if you pull. Last warning".
---
No problems after that.
---
Because the only way to guard against it is install millions of dollars worth of infrastructure to guard against an attack that will stop by the end of next week.
---
It's TukUI
---
My mates screenshot because I lost mine lol, he uses Threat Plates Addon for the name plates like above stitches.
---

---
I doubt you’d sell that as Cresent Staff is a WC quest reward with similar stats if I’m not mistaken.
---
Not a hunter but a lock. Imp I have full auto. I only control what target it attacks. Every other demon is full manual with the exception of having the succ's lash of pain on auto (although once I get a few more levels for that talent that lets me drain my demons mana that will go on manual too).
---
good shit! loved the edge of the world pic and the skyline one as well :)
---
It's TukUI, ElvUI is a heavily modified version of TukUI.
---
To translate that into English, he means weapon DPS and weapon speed are irrelevant, all you need to look at are the stats and special effects
---
I would echo that. Alchemy and Leatherworking don't seem to require much of any effort whereas the others you'll spend time (and/or money) specifically trying to work on them to keep up.
---
The conslepart is shameful

If you're playing alliance you play against 2 factions: the horde and your own faction. Seems to be a massive flood of hordes on all servers and everyone just gank you on sight in groups and spam emotes on you. World PvP has never been this dishonorable in my 15 years of WoW. Might be the edgy kids growing up now idk.
---
&gt;they obviously dont openly support linux.
---
Clear difference between **not supporting** and **knowingly writing code to intentionally block of linux users**, i think we can both agree those are NOT the same fucking thing at all
---
&gt;You're acting like its racism or something
---
Are you meaning to tell me someone saying the N word on a fucking screen in a game that you can block is more detrimental than an entire platform being completely excluded from playing a game in any way shape or form?
---
Can't login since yesterday here, no matter the server.
---
Can’t have one without the other.
---
Yeah, the players are largely very helpful, friendly and funny.

If you're not trying to play with anyone in specific or plan super far into the future just pick one that's in your timezone, that's about it

Better. WC staff is +7 int, spirit, and stam

The quests and xp rates in zones are all over the place. Early on there's typically too many quests and you will be over leveled (not that that's a bad thing). Later on zones will not have enough quests to level you enough for the next ones and you need to grind or go back and forth between zones.

I’m got two kids and I start a new job today. I’m going to be getting like 10 hours a week max to play, I really can’t sit in queues. I even tried to queue early, but I kept on getting dc’d from the queue, so I gave up and went to judgement.
---
It’s dead, like can’t run dungeons dead.
---
Far better they leave 20 seconds in than they leave 20 minutes in.
---
It would be a short-term fix with long-term repercussions. Leather is cheap right now, an enchanting is a huge benefit in the long term as well as requiring a large sunk cost even at level 100.
---
Imo stick it out. As you level enchanting make sure you offer enchants to ppl, you will make tips that way
---
The mindset of most of these large servers is "Everyone else can move" so no ones moves bBlizz created this by not having enough servers at launch. Now waiting to long for free moves. On OCE we got a new pvp server about 10 hours after release. A 3rd pvp server. Didbt have a chance to live as everyone was already on arugal or yojamba. They didnt want to move again 6 hours after yojamba opened.
---
This is a failure at the start creating a mindset that everyone else can leave but not me when these server transfers came along.
---
It's not a race. It'll be a while before BWL releases. Plenty of time for MC
---
No, that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Tanks are not infallible, how well you adapt to a poor tank is how fast your run will go, and if you start chain pulling for a poor tank, it's going to be very slow.
---
This Dude Understands what made Warcraft Great. World PVP forces interaction, and gives that /3 Channel a Meaning.

Right, I understand that T1 and T2 are immune to fire damage and raids have limited debuff slots. But that wasn't really the question here. I'm looking for advice on whether I need to reallocate my Affliction talents, and where the extra 2 points in Destruction should go.
---
Isn't it a rule that everyone is required to have at least one Nelf Chick Hunter? ;-).

---
I think you would just swap to it pre-fight, some of the CD would start ticking before you even engage. I also think you might underestimate mage damage, even the chance of reflecting a frostbolt from a mage or a shadowbolt from a lock (with the shadow version) is just so strong, I guess.
---
Ultimately I just know these trinkets are commonly used and considered very strong, not all the details.

There aren't enough servers for a server to be "dead" as long as the Classic naysayers who were predicting it would fail or not last continue to be proven wrong. I think that as long as you don't crave a hugely packed server, and need there to be thousands upon thousands online at all times, you should be okay rolling on any North American server. 
---
Just be respectful of RP servers, if you move to one of those. I'm in an RP server and we only rarely get the occasional troll who talks shit or makes fun of people who RP, but it's still obnoxious.
---
It only gets better past lvl 30. You haven't even got to enjoy the thrill and agony of PVP yet!
---
Actually he does hesitate for a brief moment to /say “God Damn Horde” before then charging into battle which only adds to the legend of Chestnutz of Herod. Also being Alliance on Herod I hope I run into him.
---
Sucks about that ban though
---
It being an immense waste of an item is an opinion, not a fact. A fact would be something like, the roll system as intended is that you roll need if you will use it. If you want gold, you click the goddamn gold coin
---
I don’t want FOP dagnabbit! I’m a Dapper Dan man.
---
I hate the notion that every game must continue on in perpetuity to please ever ravenous playerbase, burning through content and only demanding more. It will take a tremendous amount of time to fully "complete" a character--Naxx equipped and all. And that's only if you consider end game progression the only meaningful breadth of content in Classic, and also ignore all replayability.
---
I'm also highly skeptical of the suggestion that modern devs can retain the "spirit" of vanilla forever. Not because they're bad game designers (although they are a completely different team than the one that built the game *15 years ago*), but because it's complete human nature to iterate on past design, even if unintentional. I think people are absolutely underestimating just how hard it is to completely divorce yourself from every game design convention that has been normalized in the past decade-and-a-half. Either the devs iterate in small ways, slowly changing the character of the game. Or they avoid iterating, and fall into a repetition of familiar content patches with familiar mechanics and familiar progression each time. (The latter being basically what's become of retail content releases.)
---
Of course, all of this ignores the fact that what is considered the "spirit" of vanilla, is ***incredibly subjective.*** The meaningful hallmarks of vanilla design is completely different to different people. And what one considers a cool addition, may be a complete subversion to another. I for example, would consider the readdition of areas to be completely antithetical to classic WoW PvP.
---
Let us not forget that retail WoW was not ruined by a single nefarious design choice, no developer ever thought they were spoiling what made the game good. Retail WoW's downfall was the product of small changes and good intentions, and *that* is why people are mistrustful of additions.

Calm down. His twitter got deleted, but he was discussing it there. There might be backups of his tweets on archive or somewhere else.

I do not like your interface.

Pretty sure ypu know how it works and all tho lol.

At first I thought EU Razorgore is going to be the usual 60/40 for horde. I didn't see many alliance players in zones like ashenvale, stonetalon or hillsbrad. That said I was slightly ahead of the pack (lvl 51 atm). But stv and tanaris was full of alliance.
---
I screamed.
---
I got invincible my second time killing heroic lich king. That same day I went to try for ashes of alar for the first time and it also dropped.
---
Are you complimenting his suicidal tendencies?
---
Yeah nope
---
Honestly dude.. some people have this weird mentality of thinking the leveling dungeons are Naxx equivalent 5-mans, and careful coordination is required, which is set by the tank and the tank alone, and become quite elitist about it like some tanks can be (because they’re the gods of WoW and dungeon groups). You’re rationale and explanation were on point, and if they want to continue spending 3+ hours clearing WC (seriously, wtf?), then let them! :)
---
People not wanting to take some time to read something is one of the reasons, why the current MMO marked is like it is. And also the reason why I think Classic is one of the best things that happened to this industry in years.
---
I don't force you or anyone to read the full thing. But I will not put in a TLDR because it would also be too much to read for some.
---
Why spread false info? If you can’t back it up then don’t say it.
---
It would not be called an expansion. It would be called additional phases of dungeon or raid in content, but it would not be called an expansion. But I doubt they could successfully do new linear progression dungeons after NAX, because people would inevitably view them as catch up content similar to what the ICC 5-man dungeons turned out to be. A way to bypass an expansion earlier content.
---
So why did blizzard choose to drop down to 25 and 10 man rating for burning Crusade? Because they were trying to make the game more accessible and dropping the number of players needed for a raid was the first step to do that.
---
They could have made burning Crusade only 40 Man raids. But people would have grown more burned out of 40 Man rating content if blizzard had done that,
---
Legolas is still cool and always will be cool. 15 years is nothing to an elf.

I don't even know why I laughed at this

If only "Healers do damage during downtime" didn't become "Healers spend most of the fight dealing damage and occasionally tossing out a heal."

As a Priest, I'm totally cool with warlocks doing it, however it does stress me out when I forget they're warlocks and I think they're dying lol

Feel like I can actually have fun with people I both know and don’t know, and I am absolutely loving it
---
Yeah, except each one gets turned into a different zone, none of which are neighboring each other!
---
Really looking forward to this.
---
Of Course, Comrade. It is always Horde who are Aggressor, Never Alliance. Alliance are victim only, defender only, Horde is godless heathens who gang up on poor defenseless alliance. /s
---
Just need to sub. The base WoW game has been "free" for awhile now.

PSA, if  you're too Immersed in water, you may drown.

*from when it’s delivered, not started. Big difference actually.
---
I'm fine with them tapping but ffs get below 20% so my greater heal crits aren't completely wasted.
---
No, the PVE content on PVE servers is as hard as it is on PVP servers. Of course this difficulty is all relative based on how many mobs are alive at any given time on any server.
---
Is it rogue t2 ?
---
I'm not a boomer.  I'm from that weird group that falls between gen x and millennials.  They call us xennials.
---
make sure it's activated on your character select screen (bottom left corner, "Add Ons" button). Click on "load out of date add ons" and see if that helps. If this changes nothing, uninstall the add on and reinstall it from a different site than you originally got it.

all that's missing is the screamo and a dramatic screenshake
---
Thats why I'd need and roll it out.
---
If you state that you can need it just to not get it ninjaed thats a totally different deal.
---
Lets say it like this, if Gutripper drops, and I see that our Rogue has needed while the rest of our group has greeded, I will greed 100%. That Rogue needs it. Then I'd prefer that he actually equips it if he gets it, but hey, what can you do, if he takes it to sell thats how it is. Its just virtual currency in a game after all, and shit happens.
---
Wait i thought that it was just normal quest text lmao
---
Seriously tho. It is basically free if you change 3 things in the registry. If you are tech savy enough to want to use linux, then you can know how to get windows for free. This is clearly the best workaround. Nerd.
---
So I’m going on past memories when i say it takes more time with a shaman tank so I could be wrong. I was just thinking back into my vanilla days
---
As a holy priest, i just keep a renew on them, if they die, they die.
---
Enough people transfer from on full pop server to one low pop server and now you got yourself 2 medium pop severs where everyone is happy and not a glass half full of salt
---
You don't find a community. You don't magically stumble into a premade Community into which you fit like the perfect puzzle piece. You start at level 1, you meet people, you make friends, you find some jerks, you put them on ignore. Community is first and foremost effort from you and a choice to set down Roots. Because you can meet people and have fun on any server. But if you need other people to tell you on which server you will meet the best people and have the most fun, you are fundamentally lacking in certain people skills that will make your community experience less than satisfying.
---
I hate warlocks for the very same reason. I am a priest.
---
How 15g really? I don't have skinning
---
You are the one who decided it is false. It isn't - that's what he claimed and Im sure people also discussed it on the blizzard forums and possibly here earlier. 
---
Why are you so aggressively against this? Downvoting and continuously claiming I 'pull shit out of my ass' and 'spread false info'.
---
Wago.io is a site where u can find some of them, but u need ElvUi for it
---
You don't have to melt the Thorium, just the Warrior wearing them.
---
Layering allows more people to be on a server. How does that not lower the queue times?
---
Yeah, I've grouped up more since jumping back into classic then when I resubbed in legion and through to bfa. It's great hanging out with randoms, and I've been helping people out with quests I've already done!
---
Yeah it was once on Pservers, here it seemed to be 3 then they would stop, or just kill them after 1 ;p
---
Can you link any source?
---
You wouldnt tho, you could still level in classuc zones in TBC and your be better off doing that if you only interested in TBC.
---
One important point to this... 
---
Blizzard is being hosted in best datacenters in the world (Akamai, OVH, etc.). Datacenter engineers know how it works and they know how to defend their customers against DDoS attacks. 
---
OVH was attacked by 1 Tbps DDoS and they survived ([https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51640/cyber-crime/tbps-ddos-attack.html](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51640/cyber-crime/tbps-ddos-attack.html)). 
---
Even if you have DDoS attack it should take longer than 2 hours. All big multi billion dollars companies got their own Network Operation Centers (even Blizzard got one in Versailles) and they know their sh\*ts. 
---
This is not DDoS, this is typical unprepared environment and infrastructure. 
---
Please do not think that Blizzy Blizz is under constant DDoS cos it's not true.
---
Peace.

yeah you want to head to the west coast and find the little outpost on the beach near BFD, you will get a foothold on the area quests from there (LVL24+)
---
I love ret paladins, but Will I completely fuck myself over if I play one? 
---
I know it won’t matter unless I’m a high end raider and all that, but does the majority of the community see it that way too?
---
World of Warcraft originally released half my lifetime ago.  Unbelievable to think about, playing the same game 15 years ago, and now making a return.
---
The tanks should be doing the pulling for the most part. They need a second or two alone on the mob to get decent aggro otherwise dps is just going to rip the mob off the tank and rage starve them so they can't hold the mob.
---
If you think that’s intense... you should visit Norrath.
---
He just doesn't caren't.
---
Seems like thses spots are for miners. I can’t grind these spots since I won’t be able to skin for extra income but will try one or two of these spots. Nice work my man
---
You've gone off the deep end mate
---
Grid 2 is for retail is it not
---
Weapon skill with Swords and Maces gives you +5, the same as a level up. 
---
Means you hit more and get hit less.
---
As someone who also plays retail, it infuriates me when people think you cant AoE dungeons, and that you need CC for every pull or people who only drink for mana when they are completely oom, especially when the group has a mage.
---
Im playing a priest and I promise you i can keep all of you alive for as long as my mana lasts, even if all the dpsers have aggro. Just keep mobs of me and we will blaze through the dungeons. 
---
I really feel like its just tanks feeling bad when they cant hold aggro on all the targets even though it really doesnt matter that much. Use AoE, only cc if its a caster mob outside the range of the AoE (like almost every pull in WC), drink after every pull if you have mage water and keep mobs off of healers, screw dps aggro, they can handle it.
---
Alot of people are of the mindset that slow and steady is the only way, when you can in fact have a smooth run even if the aggro is abit messy.
---
Have you fished in Azshara?
---
That's very good to know! Thanks!
---
I was just walking through the badlands and he spawned next to me mid fight with a coyote. Was really lucky to get him, 2 other alliance hunters were in the area looking for him and a horde one startet the fight instant when he saw a lv40 dwarf with a lv37 cat.
---
We're talking about easy levelling experiences. I have a mage friend I level with, and while he's a powerhouse with me, and sure can kill stuff fast on his own, he'll have to drink after every fight and will die if they go to shit after an overpull.
---
Mages are definitely better in groups than solo.
---
I can't see your energy ticker addon Mr. Rogue!
---
It might of had something to do with the lead class designer for WoW maining a Frost Mage until he left Blizzard Entertainment.
---
There have been many more instances of this such as the Silentfang Rogue incident.
---
This is unreal. So amazing.

Currently rolling 29 Prot Warrior.
---
Shit, I didn't know this annoyed people, I just kinda do it out of habit. I do the same thing if I'm running around a city or if I'm messing with my UI. I'm not impatient - I just like to jump around. Glad I know not to do it now, in case it comes off the way you guys are describing.
---
You might be able to get something for it. However price will probably peak in phase 2/3. A couple hundred gold.
---
Does anyone have a link to the fishing map guide from a few months ago?? I can’t find it:(
---
Yeah I remember the alliance patrol from back in the day. I think one of them is for a quest to intercept a message or something.
---
Lmao no, a huge part of the player base can now play.

[Its more like this](https://youtu.be/0ZjCOAnmUaQ?t=27) - cut off some crop to save the rest, even if it means you still intentionally lose yields.

ReviewBrah always lookin like a mafia boss.
---
What server has MC pugs already?!
---
Thats correct. Additionaly a pen is easier on your wrist than a mouse. Many injuries can be prevented this way and you really dont feel the difference once u get used to it.
---
Totally. And DPS classes have the tools to deal with aggro themselves  Hunters have Feign Death and Disengage. Warlocks get pet support and Fear. Mages though, mages just get CC and AoE and Blink for all it's worth. 
---
As a rogue, feint usually does the trick for me, but if not, vanish always works. More often then not I just lay the DPS on even harder and kill them before they kill me (for trash mobs, never really aggro bosses, but can take more than a few hits).
---
Point being, I'm tryna top these DPS charts. I ain't gonna do it slowly. We'll see what happens when it comes raid time.
---
You seem to have SM on 34, which is just wrong. 30+
---
Did the same thing. Thought it is a good idea to fight the centaurs with the guards. Got killed in 2 sec because of storm
---
I've been threatened with the most random shit. A Priest kept trying to sabotage my AoE pulls (and failing), but one time I just Ice Blocked which turned the mobs on him. I ran away and noticed he still hadn't released so I did /point /laugh and more spam. He whispered me "good luck ever finding a Priest to heal you again by the way."
---
I was going to ask for elaboration because I was very curious about how he was going to manage to inform every Priest on our server that I was a twat who shouldn't be healed, but he put me on ignore immediately.

---
his dad works for blizzard okay
---
Yeah. Surely those 90 health every 3rd second would've saved him when he takes 4-500 damage per second.
---
Got a question about etiquette. 
---
Was running SFK, and we came across a locked chest. There happened to be a rogue in the group, so we rolled for the chest. Now I can't remember if the rogue rolled or not, but, regardless, when he picked the lock he took everything in it. 
---
Now I had won the chest, but I saw that he got nothing but trash in it so I brushed it off. However, there was a hunter in the group who immediately whispered demanding me to kick the rogue. I whispered the rogue about it, and he said that it is essentially a 'rogue chest' and that we wouldn't have been able to get it without him anyway.
---
This seemed a little selfish to me, but I decided to let it go for the sake of the run. The hunter then whispers again calling me a 'spineless little bitch' and basically complains and threatens to leave for the remainder of the dungeon. (He never left.) 
---
THEN the last boss drops a lockbox. Everyone greeds except the hunter who ninjas it and logs with a big ol fuck you to everybody. 
---
What am I to make of this? How are these locked chests typically handled? Would you have reported the guy for calling you a spineless little bitch? Usually people are so chill in this game, and it really caught me off guard.
---
Are you questing, going in dungeons, AoE farming? Basically, are you mostly attacking a single target or larger groups of mobs?
---
That's kind of mixing two definitions though. Orcs are fierce, but definitely not uncontrolled, as their ability to harness their rage is the big point of their transition from old demonic Horde to the new one. Orcs under Thrall are still warriors, and it shows, but they don't fight for the sake of it, and many quests around Kalimdor underline that idea. Darkspear trolls, as it would appear, aren't violent at all - in fact their softness in the eyes of other troll tribes was exactly the reason for their exile from Stranglethorn so much time ago. Undead stand out so much with their indiscriminate hate for all life, even Thrall was reluctant to let them into the Horde.
---
Tauren are absolutely the least violent of the three, but I don't agree that they don't belong. Even they are quite fierce as warriors when it comes to defending their homes, but it's easy to forget that since the later story changed them into full pacifists.
---
Not sure if it's the best available right now, but I have DejaClassicStats for that (and more importantly for me, things like dodge%, defense, etc).
---
I don’t really care about them in any means so I personally don’t really give a fuck.
---
It only removes bleeds and poisons. It only affects a handful of matchups.
---
* vs Rogue - Remove blind/wep poison/rupture
---
* vs Warrior - Remove deep wounds, normally to bandage after blind
---
* vs Ud Priest - Remove dev plague
---
* vs Hunter - can remove stings but not that useful  
---
Basically it's nice in duels vs rogue and warrior, but mainly to get blind-&gt; bandage -&gt; opener off, so rarely useful in group pvp.
---
I think we’ve been proven that mage is the fastest leveler though ;) 
---
Inb4 « doesn’t count because layering QQ »
---
As a healer, few times i had the thought "this tank is from retail". Because he kept pulling without any regard of my mana situation. I mean, go out of combat for 0.1s and ill get enough mana to keep you alive.  But no, gotta chainpull.
---
Time to start calling it was it is a cheater
---
We should be friends, I’m HelenofTroll.
---
I never had the chance to play Everquest. Not because I was not interested. I had no easy access to internet back then and when Vanilla WoW released, no income to pay for the sub. And my parents didn't want to pay for it.
---
But I always wondered about the "old days" of MMO's. That's the reason why I am also interested in Pantheon, should it ever release.
---
Natures grasp is really nice when I see an Alliance player coming at me. I agree it could've been put later, since I mostly use it in pvp as a security measure.
---
Furor is really good early on actually. But that's just my opinion. Since I usually start a fight with casting an offensive spell or Rejuv, and then shapeshift to get the energy/raid and start right away with dealing big damage.
---
I don't know, I've been using this for months and found it working really good. But hey, what do I know. I just looked up speed leveling for the druid and found this spec from Shedo the Druid. Who's supposed to be a really good druid player.
---
Sorrow Hill Camping Allies... tastey.
---
In classic i am growing to be powerful. In retail i am a born god.
---
Had this bug aswell, just relog and you will be fine.
---
It's possible to find a guild who will take you, but they'll be few and far between if you're not already friends with them.
---
Yep mageweave on my server runs for about 1g.
---
I got lucky with my first two mageweave because just as I wanted to buy some cloth for a crafter someome undercut mageweave cloth by about 30 silver a stack. So I got them for 95 silver per stack. Now the market generally is around that number.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
I'm late to the show.  How to add status in grid when they aren't in the drop down?
---
Restart
---
Don't forget to report people like that. I don't know where you are from, but in most countries it is a crime to tell people to kill themselves, and i bet it is something that will easily net you a 24 hour ban in WoW as well.
---
I'm not, I can always find another parrot.
---
Honestly I think it might be worth rerolling with the name you love. The grind is too long to regret it! I promise you’ll regret it if you don’t reroll with Bryce
---
I swear it’s like some people came straight from the garbage can.
---
&gt;As someone who also plays retail, it infuriates me when people think you cant AoE dungeons, and that you need CC for every pull or people who only drink for mana when they are completely oom, especially when the group has a mage.
---
Guessing you didnt levelup in instances. Because thats ALL what everyone now sitting at L60 did. AOE, CLEAVE.. pulling a fuckton of mobs and killed them all. Doing ZF up to the stair event with 3 pulls.
---
Guild wars 2 handles it pretty well because even after 2 expansions the level cap is the same. When they add new upgrades to gear they are very minimal in power. They shoot for a lot of utility through new systems but everyone's power level remains pretty much the same.
---
Would be like if wow released karazhan for classic as the raid after naxx. When you go in there the gear that drops is on par with naxx stat budget wise. But there are special enchants earned on the rep vendors from there that would give you maybe 5% more damage and maybe some secondary effects like extra damage to ghosts. 
---
The difference between doing it and not doing it is not huge but it's something to work towards and it brings new content.
---
The progression type things, that are unrelated to gear, they added with each expansion were mastery systems that were essentially just levels but in a secondary system. That rewarded you with talent points to gain new abilities and utility in the new areas added and some effects that worked everywhere else as well.
---
Wow like examples would be unlocking new profession recipes, unlocking new methods of travel, accessing special areas of added zones.
---
So essentially adding to all the systems already in the game but not increasing your characters level past 60 or the power level much higher than naxxaramas could be doable and you can create a lot of content that follows a similar approach to gw2.
---
I'm pretty sure it's account bound and only useable since it's basically the same account.
---
Yo I'm horde and playing sulfurus if you wanna swap and need some people to go with
---
My advice:
---
Dont let it bother you.
---
Streamer are like boybands.
---
Everyone whos a Fan put all their time in them to get the Feeling of beeing a Part or their community.
---
Hunter prolly seen you betraying. For the alliance!
---
Thank you Blizzard for ruining the game over the years, then releasing the original version and making a huge profit off the back of it. I can't wait to see the money pumped into a lootbox-heavy mobile game.
---
OP you missed an ppporunity by not camling this "How to save a flight"
---
Hell, as a warrior I was wearing a few leather pieces during WC as I was unlucky w/ a few drops and they were great upgrades at the time.
---
Eh, gold is a currency, and since we dont pay taxes in wow, there is literally no problem with receiving gifts.
---
I have to say that I think the people that give them gold are absolute retards, but thats besides the point. People can do what they want with their gold, why bother to care
---
If it means so much to you man I’d just restart. I don’t see blizzard helping you in this situation... I could be wrong
---
Signed ChickNoodleSalad

Really? Didn't think it goes for that much. Still new and figuring the economy out.

This needs more recognition
---
Why does it seem the vast majority of Rogues play Undead over Orc?  Am I underestimating the power of Cannibalize?  Or is it all an aesthetic thing?
---
shit i think i was still doing that in bc or wotlk
---
No. Ret is a functionally broken spec in classic. They removed most of their abilities right before the launch and they basically only have 1 button to press every 6 seconds, and otherwise do white damage only
---
Lol I did that quest for like two hours solo cause no one wanted to do it and finally a couple 30s came down the road and I pleaded for help and FINALLY GOT IT.  My friends kept telling me to abandon it but I kept saying fuck you guys I'm finishing this damn quest no matter what.
---
Tried this morning on ubuntu and was unable to log into the wow. Do you mean you upgrade the driver and that made it work(, if so what driver and version is working for you?
---
it was going to be a raid, they prob cut all the bosses from it and added it to HFC
---
I also did this once on accident and failed everytime since.
---
I think I'll take this advice then. Thanks!
---
Blizzard is definitely blocking Linux clients. Can’t play from my Manjaro desktop but my MacBook is fine. Figured I would supply another data point
---
if the bruiser wasn't there it would be a different story
---
TBC heroics were fucking brutal. I don't think I ever even bothered to try the speedrun.
---
*Breaking Me Down intensifies*
---
What kind of rule should they put into place? No longer allowing people to trade gold?
---
That's some low standards for farming! I'd end up indentured to Farmer Saldean.
---
&gt;Every comment I have made is about pulling for the tank, very clearly, even explicitly in most cases. That's your context. I guess that was ten minutes ago though, maybe you've forgotten.
---
Bruh,who's refuting this?? 
---
We completely agree on the multi dimensional approach required to dictate pace.
---
You addressed my point that -
---
when tanks aren't doing this I will
---
By outlining the risk of edge case outlier occurrences like Pats, DCs, IRL issues.
---
Levelling dungeons are so damn easy that I'm arguing we do not need to offset this risk by trimming the run to a pace that's 50-100%+ longer than a pace that could be done without nearing the extremes of aoe or cleaving.
---
To which you ended with well tanks are going to be bad deal with it.
---
Taking us back to ---
---
I am dealing with it by 
---
1) communicating
---
2) saying fuck it we'll drag them along by going at the pace we can dial up to
---
Which you say this is in fact slower than just leaving things be. 
---
So maybe that's where we differ. Your approach is sit back, while mine is dial it up but please be more direct in delivery and we can arrive at this much much sooner
---
I wonder if it is actually a DDOS attack or just bad servers. We have pretty good DDOS prevention/mitigation tools.
---
Probably 2 to 3 gold now tho. Gotta get that mount!
---
Yesterday we made a party of 5mages. We melted mobs before they could hurt anyone. Priest and warrior are dead weight.
---
&gt;they do, but you get a mount extremely early, like level 20 i think now, and its super cheap. then there are portals in like every city, and just overall, going somewhere is less of an adventure
---
everything about that is awful
---
Maybe "culin" -&gt; "cooling" -&gt; "cool down" -&gt; "buff"?
---
It's a bit of a stretch but it would explain what he wants: he buffed OP and was expecting to get buffed himself. Who knows.
---
people donate real money to these people on twitch
---
I've seen it on the AH for 60 Gold (Gehennas) but I'd say its smarter to save it.
---
The only ones who'd buy it right now are those who either want to use it down the line when BG's release, or want to flip it.
---
Then again, BG's are still a long way down, so try and list it for some ludicrous price and slowly drop it if you want the gold now. Shadowfang is special after all.
---
Getting real tired of warlocks spamming hellfire until they're pretty much dead. As a healer this is really annoying and seems like a waste of mana. So many locks get themselves down to 10-20% HP then take damage from a mob or so and die. 
---
I'm not going to prioritise my heals on DPS killing themselves...
---
War is a tough way when you're solo but don't give up ! After 40, the real fun begin !
---
Did you receive the pet only in Classic or retail, too?
---
This is (used to be) a thing, especially early on. Some recipes only drop from certain bosses/chests and have a low drop chance to boot, and if you are one of few who can craft a desired item or endgame piece and spend any time in /2, you will be remembered. I've added several players to my Friends as they are some of the few people I've seen who can make 10 slot bags!
---
You also bring up some good points. Many of the things you consider annoying (as per your post) have been removed or drastically changed in the future expansions, but I (and based on your conclusions, you as well) think that these QoL changes came at the cost of immersion, community building and sense of accomplishment.
---
Stand tall, young Priest.
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
much much much easier than in retail. the only thing you have to do is watch your mana.
---
Because its a game and using a unfair advantage so big as that should be considered cheating
---
Yeah when you're the designated tank and you have to chat the group to be a little more strategic about their approach to a fight it gets strangely annoying. This game requires a little more patience and finess. A lot slips through the cracks.
---
Blizzard is almost certainly right that a lot of people playing now won't be playing in a year so they couldn't just make enough servers for everyone to play on right now. So dividing the servers was the natural choice. I just think they did a poor job of it. 
---
I believe launch would have been a lot smoother if they had made each layer more permanent with no movement out of one and into another. They would stay separate as long as necessary but as populations declined could be combined back together.
---
So when they opened worldwide with only 25 servers they could have actually had 3 versions of each server available. They are too permanent to be called "layers" anymore. But these subrealms would basically be separate realms. No movement between them. Totally separate economies. And totally expandable and collapsible. 
---
When Faerlina 1, 2, and 3 fill up just from reserving names they could quickly add 4, 5, and 6. And so on and so on. When populations decrease they can merge the subrealms easily since there won't be any duplicate names. 
---
Thus there would have been space for everyone to get on a server with their friends and everyone could have played with minimal queues. There would be no issue with the timing of Phase 2 because of world boss spawns since there is no movement between subrealms. 
---
And going forward they could always carve off a F R E S H subrealm if they wanted. Say to promote the start of Phase 3 they could host another race to 60/killing Rag. Once the event was over the subrealm could be subsumed back into another so the characters would still exist.
---
If you want to pvp as horde and the class has orc, then it's always the best choice.
---
That makes sense but physical damage reduction depends on the mob, right? So the description should have been updated and even that I think that it's a big coincidence that the value will hit the pre-talented range.
---
Love threat plates, big help in instances.
---
Yeah, only ever watched streams of people playing everquest private servers, I was like 10 when everquest came out, so I never got to play.
---
I, too, am very interested in Pantheon.  When it comes out in 50 years, I just have to hope I don't have Alzheimers'.
---
What is this about? Fill me in.
---
I just switch to catform. No reason I should do shitty damage if some Asmongold aspie zoomer fanboi can't control himself to not hit shit before it even gets to the group.
---
Same here, where are you playing from?
---
Bruisers are there to keep them in check.
---
I'm level 37 gone up to and through all of SM. Honestly, hardly ever use CC; pulls are generally AoE, even if only one person is cleaving occasionally. If a druid is tanking then there's no issue. If someone else is tanking, losing aggro really isn't that big of deal; stuff doesn't hit *that* hard.
---
I'm just surprised more than anything. I played a decent amount of pvp in vanilla, making rank 12, and I've mained a mage since 2006. I just rarely encounter situations where I would have time to switch trinkets like this and have it be useful, and I would have thought that, at least playing at a level where it would be useful, the mage would be skilled enough to not only keep ice barrier up but also consider using frost ward. I just don't have first hand experience facing people using this trinket outside of a rare novelty situation.
---
Either way, I'm not disputing it happening, I'm just not sold on its immediate (and reliable) usefulness right away. I'm certainly interested in seeing some footage of this and I'll hunt it down and check it out. I just remain a little sceptical if its reliability, that's all.
---
they drop like 10s of vendor trash per kill on average
---
The internet is amazing technology, but it does have some exploitable problems. Another problem is how BGP works (Border Gateway Protocol).
---
It acts like a traffic cop, directing data to take the best path to its destination. But what if change requests are made that have nefarious intent? Who polices it all? A few months ago, data destined to Google Cloud was rerouted to a router belonging to a Chinese company for several hours, until Google managed to reclaim the routing. It was supposedly an accident. But at any time, all data of any type destined to reach point A can instead get rerouted to point B, if the right changes are submitted out to the internet. And it may not be caught within hours. It could still reach point A, after passing through B first, and maybe it's just a little laggier. So nobody notices for a long time.
---
In any case, let's hope they get it sorted out.
---
So if I help my lower level friend out with all the elite quests along the road while he levels, is that also cheating?
---
Interesting view-point.
---
For all the time you have put into agonizing over this you could already be well into leveling up the new Bryce. Send him your coin, bags, and anything else you can to give him a headstart.
---
I'm 3-4 levels off going to Hinterlands. I can't wait! love that place
---
I broke ten gold yesterday. I was so proud.
---
Streamer has 10,000 followers. Streamer asks followers to send him 1 gold each. Streamer has 10,000 gold.
---
I doubt this will work but this was my old fix.  
---
[https://youtu.be/0CJzSN59QUQ](https://youtu.be/0CJzSN59QUQ)  
---
but I think this was due to wine versions not handling Agent.exe properly
---
already getting skinning what else should i get to make gold with? mining or herbalism?
---
Healthstone :P
---
I started at level 29.
---
******SPOILER ALERT******
---
Cuz she’s dead
---
Elite noobiness honestly. Serious keyboard turning action
---
I can confirm if your ISP gives ipv6 you can get in
---
I hate it when you hack one to death and find all the fins in pristine condition. I mean I just wanted some torn ones, dammit.
---
Take the Destiny formula and add some StarCraft. Just set it after Brood War and not SC2 and we're golden.
---
I know. I have no idea why they pulled it out of retail. The long nights and the big rains rule.
---
&gt;Chad arms
---
Is that a robe you're wearing? You're awfully close to the retris on the DPS meter there, Melvin.
---
&gt;Melvin fury
---
Menwhile the fury chad is clad in leather displaying his muscles, massive package and impressive machismo at the top of the DPS charts literally throughout the expansion like a fantasy mix of Schwarzenegger and Hulk Hogan.
---
That made me nervous to watch haha
---
If I were lvl 15 with this bag space I would kill myself
---
I agree with you! Also when I figured out that there are priest racial skills, something I've completely forgot about in retail WoW. It just adds up to the experience and how strongly I feel connected to my class/race decision. Undead priest might not be the "BiS" for PvE when we look at the racial skills, but it is still nice to have a bit of difference between me and a troll priest.
---
Can this still be a thing with layering?
---
Barrens chat is called /b/arrens, based on the /b/ forum of 4chan, which is known as the toilet of the internet.
---
So yeah, it's synonymous with shit-posting.
---
Bro eat his ass!
---
Restart. Two weeks in the scheme of things isn’t long.
---
Save it until Phase3 and sell for a few hundred gold.
---
The second char is significantly faster than the first because you have some starting funds to dump into bags and stuff. Definitely worth the reroll!
---
&gt;First of all, you are are comparing Runescape to World of Warcraft
---
Never played RS but boi is that a retarded thing to say, its more than obviously one of the really big titles in MMO history.
---
There's a slider in the settings for max camera distance. I think it's Interface options-&gt;Camera
---
Why block out his name? Let people know not to group with this guy.
---
IF you absolutely HAVE to have gold right now I don't think anything lower than 50g. But if you are willing to hold onto it and sell it later you'll make a lot more.
---
As a horde he probably did only go to duskwallow for that.
---
Last night i dinged 20 on my shaman by exploring orgrimmar while dead in spirit form, felt good.
---
Can be taught, ain’t he?
---
I concur.
---
This is what cheating looks like
---
You have some options.
---
1. The HE tunnel broker.
---
2. Figure out how to transplant the Windows SSL library into wine with native overrides. The files you want are likely schannel.dll and some dlls with sspi in their name.
---
3. Figure out how to patch gnutls to mimick the Windows SSL library.
---
And even then they still drag on the ground.
---
First war too, I'm 40 now and here the advices my friend (war for a loonnnng time) told me : 
---
* Get a lot of food (up cook, so, up fishing)
---
* Up your first aid
---
* abuse of Hamstring to avoid being constantly hit (and remember to strafe in the mob to not get dazed)
---
* Bow or gun to pick up your fights
---
* Up fury tree until 40, arms after (for lvling)
---
* 2H weapon until hit cap
---
* Group whenever you can (priests are your waifus)
---
* Don't despair, the light come after mortal blow
---
* Enjoy the fact you can tank with a fury spec until Maraudon maybe.
---
The problem is theres no way to prove the completion of a bounty without using out of game resources.
---
From what a streamer said, delete brycee, have a friend on another account name a new lvl 1 brycee, then you restore your deleted character and it will be forced into a name change, name it Bryce.
---
This is what a fanboy looks like
---
Lol oddly specific and really weird if u ask me, seems like ur projecting. Though im actually 81kg and 183cm and played on a pserver to lvl 20 to try which class i like. Again you're really fucking weird
---
Why is this every other post?
---
Most people pick the race they like more, not racials.
---
I don't understand fishing in games but i respect them. What would be your "elevator pitch" for why you love fishing in games like WoW? I'm just so fascinated by that but when i play all i want to do is pop off big numbers in fights and survive
---
Looks like he got attention though, so mission success
---
Not with fishing but I swear I had an unusually high amount of mobs have empty windows today when looted.
---
Guild name Indecisive haha.
---
Holy sh... Grats ! xD
---
Or better yet, in a world of mythical beasts and dragons and magic, just a subtle glow under the platform to signify some sort of enchantment?
---
Fair enough :)
---
Ahh memories
---
I enjoyed reading this as it does sum up how i feel as well.  I liked a lot of things about retail... glyphs, the Transmogg and all the races to choose from, but hated most of the things which seem to shrink the world into some big social game lobby where you port from place to place to do the things you want to do...
---
If he was horde, that is where the books are at and where orgrimmar is at.  He either flew both ways, used a hearth, or ran for 30 minutes.
---
Or any guild recruitment that isn’t just “casual leveling guild looking for members!” Be creative guys.
---
Who
---
\*In Aragorn's voice:\* FOR FRAUSTED !
---
Must be pretty boring never going to a concert, watching a movie, going to a sporting event or watching netflix.  Imagine giving millionaires money, lol.
---
DID SOMEBODY SAY
---
I have mine keybound to alt-1,2,3.  I'm currently tanking LBRS runs on my way to 60, so I'm stance dancing pretty often.  I start most pulls with a charge, then either swap to zerker to intercept a mob further away and group the packs, or just swap to defensive.  
---
Once you hit 36 and learn whirlwind as an arms warrior, you get to start doing the combo that will make you feel incredibly happy for picking a warrior: the sweeping strikes whirlwind.  Start im battle stance and you'll do the following: charge -&gt; bloodrage -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; zerker stance -&gt; whirlwind and you'll hit up to 4 mobs twice each.  Combine with windfury totem and Ravager and you quickly feel like a god.
---
Stalagg? Cause it’s like 5-1 horde in contests zones
---
It got destroyed in WC3, I thought they are basically rebuilding it under there.
---
Headless murlocs in Southshore are the norm.
---
expected price per later on? what price do you think its good to buy them at?
---
It actually has 0 effect in pvp. Weapol skill is a pve thing
---
I spend an hour or so setting up ElvUI yesterday because I couldn't find a working Grid - will look into this later.
---
Not sure what you're trying to add in, though? I used Grid many years (Shaman) and can't really think of what you'd be looking for, except maybe adding in Renew, Shield and Weakened Soul. Could you be a bit more descriptive?
---
Haven't done Grid setup in many years and can't recall it from my memory, but will check back later once I've gotten home.
---

I blame both, i understand you gotta mitigate attacks somehow but this is not the way to do it, as for those virgin social outcasts who want to harvest attention, i don't think blizzard will hold back on the lawsuit if they find them, they have an extremely good case for damages if given the opportunity to take it to court.
---
Same here!
---
AAAAAND IIIiiIiiIII WILL ALWAYS LOOOoOVE YOOOOoOOoOoOO
---
It's not cheating, you're just upset someone got something you can't have.
---
This guy's right. Bank it till Phase 2. People will have money then and 19 twinks will be a big deal. You'll make 10/20 times more than it's worth now.
---
Just helped my friend out killing it (I'm level 35). When we were handing it in, I saw 2 low level 30s about to start it. (and about to fail :P) So I offered to help them out. I didn't ask for a reward but afterwards the guy ran up to me and gave me 3 gold. Which was nice. So if you are a warrior and have a hunter friend, ask him to help you out. He can probably easily kill it. (Missing the beginning of the video because obs reconnected)
---
OMG I'm an idiot.  Was so confused hahaha
---
Orcs invaded and broke human kingdoms and towns, rallied enemies and barbarians into a formidable force that previously were relegated to the corners of the world to wage war and kill civilized races. Orcs are the problem. &gt;:|
---
If someone says that to you you can actually report them for language, if its their 3rd offence they get a 24 hour ban.
---
I never report people for bad language by itself of course but if someone has been a jerk and then starts abusing me I take advantage of the fact they are swearing their heads off at me.
---
I feel as though the Hunter, while I can sympathize with wanting to be fair, was in the wrong and his thought process is in the minority. 
---
In all the runs I've been a part of, locked chests are an afterthought as most groups won't have a method to unlock them. For the times there is a method, either Engineeers with Seaforium Charges, Blacksmiths with Skeleton Keys and Rogues with Lockpicking, there's an investment (either money or time in the case of a lockpick) into opening it, and the chest belongs to the person who is capable of opening it. 
---
Definitely shouldn't be expected to be rolled upon imo. It's all the work of the person opening it.
---
Bad time to be in grom'gol! 
---
Isn't the new meta at this point to /g layer me
---
I know what you mean. I trusted games so much that as a human fresh out of westfall i walked way too close and saw his skull portrait and realized that this insta-death juggernaut was about to gut me. 
---
Scary as hell but it creates such a cool world in WoW. Classic wow always had this way of being subtle and trying your patience. You respected it.
---
Yeah, I asked a Latino at work and he came to the same conclusions. He doesn't understand what the guy was trying to say though.
---
Is the twitch client bugged? Can't find it
---
aha, so THAT is why I had to find 4 Scorpion Tails again. Or venom or whatever that crazy guy wanted me to gather.
---
Add BC with no flying and no lfg I say. Bring on the sexc goats and elves.
---
I keep running into the buff level requirement when buffing passing lowbies. Beta supposedly had automatic downranking, classic doesn't. Not really possible to automate in a modern addon either.
---
Pretty shitty of you to be fair
---
The true vanilla way.
---
About to start playing, is it better to get on a full server with friends or low pop server alone and transfer later?
---
If OP had fans and they gave it to him, I bet there would be far less complaining. OP, learn to not pay attention to others and just enjoy your game. You gonna developed ulcers with your nose in others business. Streamers at that.
---
Try the yetis at winter
---
Join LookingForGroup. You'll find someone.
---
Thats what id like to do, but alot of people still think you need to go slow af. There is also a middle ground between AoEing everything in one pull and pulling one mob at a time and there is where id like to be, pulling 2-3 packs and AoE them down.
---
&gt;BronzeDragonFrame
---
Not sure if you read this or not but wanted to make sure you got it if you hadn't seen it!
---
I have been dungeon grinding since lvl 35 in SM and now I am in ZF lvl 44 still healing whilst specced full shadow , is there any need to respec to holy ?  Or is it worth it?
---
It's treason then
---
The warlock way is to aggro as many as possible with the vw and leave him behind to die while you make your escape.
---
Well slower weapons are not only good for arms, they are wanted for fury as well since overpower and whirlwind work the same way as MS.
---
This was on Firemaw EU. Had 1 wipe on Baron Geddon because the healers forgot to dispel, but second attempt went smooth as butter. MC was easier than what I remembered
---
Wow! So clutch! Nice!!!
---
That's what you get for naming him Orcaxe &gt;.&lt;
---
That’s what they want you to think.
---
Insist the gold is split immediately after each boss. Then at least only the last can be stolen.
---
But yea, wouldn't do.
---
other post says IPv6 should work, set your routers to use IPv6 and ingame settings to use when available.  
---
even jump in network settings and disable IPv4 and see if that helps.
---
If your planning on staying in dungeons it makes a noticeable difference yes
---
I personally love those.  Gives me an excuse to get up, pee, stretch my legs, grab a drink, question my life choices...
---
Yeah and the problem is that same tank will come on reddit and read stupid circle jerk posts like this one (seriously this gets posted literally every week, DAE NOT RETAIL????) and feel completely validated in their idiocy.
---
My point is that WC is simple enough that not having a real tank won’t slow down a good group much. Of course having a warrior/druid is miles better.
---
Ahh damn, i think the one in OG can be soloed and i guess maaaaaaaayyyybe WC ? :)
---
I was about to say "this thread again", but then I watched it and burst out laughing :D
---
I could care less about this situation irregardless of faction.
---
BRB, need to go purge my keyboard predictive text.
---
Enchanting to disenchant and sell the materials. Logic behind this is that skinning is already your dedicated farm profession and you can't really combine farming high end herbs with high end leathers. Disenchanting is your "passive" in that you can turn dungeon drops you'd vendor to something sellable in AH.
---
Shazzrah was down for quite a while aswell
---
Same here. I think it took 6 months for me and friends to hit lvl60. I never did Scholomance, Stratholme or raided. TBC hit within two weeks of me being 60. Looking forward to the rest of the journey (28 atm) and to properly experience the endgame! :D
---
24 and 14 on my two mains
---
lol this item doesn't get you close to an epic mount.
---
Yup, I start animation on tank regularly and cancel it by moving if it would overheal.
---
There's a faction of miserable weirdos here that go into a seething rage every time a WoW streamer is mentioned.  They also must spend all day hate-watching them because they are always the first ones to post whenever one of them does anything.
---
he can’t log into the world on the new level 1 because he can’t even make the character with the name brycee. it says the character name is unavailable. do you know a way around this?
---
    #showtooltip Intercept
---
    /startattack
---
    /use [harm,nodead,stance:2/3,nocombat] Battle Stance; [harm,nodead,stance:1,nocombat] Charge; [harm,nodead,stance:1/2,combat] Berserker Stance; [harm,nodead,stance:3] Intercept
---
    #showtooltip Charge
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm,nodead,stance:2/3,nocombat] Battle Stance; [@mouseover,harm,nodead,stance:1,nocombat] Charge; [@mouseover,harm,nodead,stance:1/2,combat] Berserker Stance; [@mouseover,harm,nodead,stance:3] Intercept
---
The first one is bound to Q, the second one to Shift + Q. The first one first makes me switch to Battle Stance if I'm not in it and not in combat. On the next press it makes me Charge my target. If I am not in Berserker Stance but am in combat, it makes me switch to Berserker Stance. On the next press it makes me Intercept my target.
---
The second macro does the same as the first one, but to my mouseover target instead of my target.
---
    #showtooltip Taunt
---
    /use [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead,stance:1/3] Defensive Stance; [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead] Taunt; [harm,nodead,stance:1/3] Defensive Stance; [harm,nodead] Taunt
---
This is my Taunt macro, which I bound to V. If I press Shift V while having my mouseover on a hostile enemy and while I'm not in Defensive Stance, it first puts me in Defensive Stance. Then on the second press I Taunt my mouseover target. If I don't hold Shift down, it does the same, but to my target instead of my mouseover target.  
---
You can also add /equip NameOfYourOneHandedWeapon and /equip NameOfYourShield to it so you can actually tank for a while.
---
Those are some of my current macros. I'm not level 30 yet, so I don't even have Berserker Stance and Intercept yet. But the Battle Stance/Charge parts work, so I'm pretty sure the Berserker Stance/Intercept parts will also work.
---
I also bound Battle Stance to Ctrl 1, Defensive Stance to Ctrl 2 and Berserker Stance to Ctrl 3. For Defensive Stance I added /equip NameOfMyOneHandedWeapon and /equip NameOfMyShield to the macro and for Berserker Stance I added /equip NameOfMyTwoHandedWeapon to it.
---
Yeah, its not really the concept of giving them money per say, if they do something I enjoy, I'd gladly support them.
---
I'm a big NHL fan, and probably spend 1000 dollars a year in merch and tickets, and those generally go straight down the pockets of millionaires/billionaires. But that way I get something I enjoy and promptly compensate for it.
---
When donating to a small streamer, you atleast get appreciation, which is something at least, and imo, if you want to support a big streamer, just sub. That way you at least get a badge to show that you're a fan.
---
But once again, everyone can do what they want with their money, so I 100% get your idea, I just think its odd.
---
Ah I had a similar situation but I was in arathi, heading towards a questing area while also AoE grinding raptors. I see a 31 hunter, I’m 35, he does not engage and I let the nelf be. As soon as I pull 3 raptors and start blizzarding I see his dumbass head towards me and I knew what was coming. Cone of cold the raptors and act as if I have no idea what’s going on. Wait for him to get as close as he wants. As soon as he sends the pet to me I wait to freeze it with the raptors, blink to him to get into his “no no” zone and cold snap, freeze then cone of cold (yummy shatter) fire blast/arcane explosion. At this time the raptors are also almost stacked with us. He died first and then the 3 raptors. I proceeded to /lol and cannibalize his corpse as he watched. Then sat on him for a drink. Only had to use 1 mana gem and 1 mana pot. This was just north of refugee point so I knew it wouldn’t take long for him to ress. I wait nearby, and camp him. I think after doing that 2-3 times he finally ressed next to me and /sorry /bow. I let him go then.
---
Extremely satisfying experience if you ask me.
---
If they don't buff you then it seems ungrateful, so they do what they can.
---
I think people would still choose to twink on those servers, and all the benefits would come with that.
---
Thats a sweet hunter sword
---
Use imp. Set pets to passive always, and bind pet attack. 
---
Depends how quickly stuff dies. Sometimes it's not worth using all dots. Sometimes just put up the most powerful one (which will change as you level and get new ranks). 
---
In the end it's classic and it doesn't matter if you're not squeezing out every last bit of dps.
---
Make a new one and name it /NoSteadmans
---
&gt;PvPed less than 20 hours in total.
---
I mean. You can't expect to win encounters if you don't know the ins and outs of these things. I've beaten plenty of mages as a warrior. It's all about using resources in the right way and hitting them at opportune times, not just for the heck of it.
---
It comes with time. 
---
I don't play hunter but I could already ask why you're in range of cone of cold/ice nova? If you say they blink on you, why do you not have a trap set? etc. It's really more of a chess game than it is bruteforce DPS numbers.
---
Hunter is probably the best without any gear. They don't really scale with gear anyway and are pretty strong without it until like phase 4 or 5, and even then they wouldn't be bad in PvP
---
Shadow Frame Units looks awesome but I'm having trouble getting it to work.
---
Just did my first dungeon run and finally got to the end and rolled need with the party leader for cookies stirring Rod. Then got kicked by him before the roll happened. Did I just get kicked so he'll get it? Or can I still win it? Dog shit if they can do that to gaurentee the loot
---
I don't see a difference between the performance between windows or linux for the games I play, as for why I use a linux machine. I like that linux doesn't use much diskspace when you do a min install. The only reason I keep windows on this machine is for those Korean mmos that use those cancer anticheats.
---
Thanks! But could you elaborate on "Shapeshift your imp"? I have no idea what you mean, is that some ability i do not yet have?
---
Sure you won't have time for Molten Core? It's going to be pugged 24/7 since it's so easy. And as a rogue you'll be able to perform will against pretty much any other class even at Naxx progression if you have full t1 and perd/corehound daggers.
---
Especially if you find the time to get the ZG trinket when it comes out. You won't need to raid BWL, AQ, etc.
---
Parkour!
---
Nope, I don’t attack people that are significantly lower than me. And I don’t even have the ability to stunlock, yet.
---
Well, now you know why you should just give in and play Horde!
---
I know what you mean, I always appreciate the gesture I just thought it was funny at the same time.
---
My guild leader is a ret pally. Ignoring the fact he's our GL, he's charismatic and plays Ret to it's full potential, offhealing and giving near instant cleanses. Everyone loves him in their groups. 
---
Most folks will be okay with you, only a small subset of meta slaves will be bothered enough to bar you from groups.
---
I suggest Night Elf. Shadowform is underrated. It can be used as another Vanish and it doesn't say on the character screen but there is also a passive effect giving Night Elves an additional level of stealth. So you are getting for free what other races have to put a point into Master of Deception to get. They can only get 5 extra levels of stealth. 
---
Also while this isn't a huge deal at 60 Night Elves do have more base Agility. I believe they start with 25 Agi while Dwarves, Orcs, and Undead start with 16, 17, and 18 respectively. On the downside those races have a bit more Stam. 
---
Plus there are more Hordies on PvP realms so if you roll Alliance you won't have to wait long at all for your battleground queues to pop.
---
No. If you're going to tap, then at least tap down to the level of a Heal. I already have to manage my mana to reduce downtime, if you force me to use a mana-inefficient heal I'll be salivating the entire run at the thought of winning a need roll over you and rubbing it in.
---
The best tip I have for you is to go in knowing nothing.  When vanilla originally launched, all we had was Thottbot (Wowhead's granddaddy) and our mates in game.  You will learn things as you go.
---
ne rogues have higher level stealth then any other race.
---
Plus shadowmeld is on a different cooldown then stealth and that is huge for world pvp and AV.
---
Only dwarven might outshine them.
---
I like [chatter](https://www.wowace.com/projects/chatter), takes away those buttons on the left, class colored names, etc. (Classic version was rolled into that version so it works)

Im not sure about that. Swipe only hits 3 targets, and demo generates a really good amount of threat, especially with high numbers of mobs

Hi, /u/Lord-of-Rats

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1nmct/what_do_you_think_is_easier_to_level_with_warlock/). 
---
Thats Not very effecient
---
I didn't ask about the performance. More or less Linux is not supported by half of the mainstream PC games.
---
And I have to say, undead just fits the theme better. I always felt that big burly barbarian orcs shouldn't be able to stealth and fitness around. Just never sat right with me.
---
why would you try to rush the game? enjoy it at your own pace man, im looking at my download bar right now.
---
Not necessarily a healing tip, but communicating to your group and marking up a skull (yes, even as the healer) can be a really good way to manage pulls. If you can get a really good group, you can ask them to let you get killing blows on one mob per pack to keep a spirit tap rolling :)
---
They didn't reserve any item, they also didn't inspect for invite. I guess most people at 60 now knows what they need to do before joining a raid pug.
---
Yeah but you can't slide those buttons out of frame, hate that about the default.
---
I've actually started to enjoy this in my own right. I usually get 3v1'd with a few levels on me. I play a warlock, so I take my pride in just outplaying those losers. I usually have enough time to /chicken everyone.
---
Spec Sub, empty bags except for survival/rogue stuff and HS and pickpocket all SM parts where you don't get detected. Consider leveling up a bit to your late 30s, perhaps.
---
Not sure what you mean. There is a pretty new fishing guide which has some nice info in it. Check if that one works. It is where all guides are in wowhead.
---
This is... brilliant!
---
I have been trying to test this, and it really seems to be the case. I will go from leveling 100% of the time for a bunch in a row, then rarely, then it will turn green.
---
Not removed entirely, if I'm not mistaken, but the nights aren't as long or dark and the other weather effects are similarly depleted.
---
Sort of? A lot of it is specifically designed to be legitimately addictive and not in a good way, there's a reason this thing was kind of known as a life destroyer back then. It's like gambling, maybe it'll hit you hard, maybe it won't.
---
Why should I not have the freedom to use my computer the way I want? We on Linux aren't causing trouble for anyone, we have legitimate installs of the game and run it without doing anything weird to their files, we totally respect the integrity of the entire system. We just want to run it a free, secure system with a more customizable user experience, what's wrong with that?
---
For what it's worth, it's kinda nice that younger players are picking it up, too. Hopefully it proves that it stood the test of time - 15 years is essentially an eternity in game years.
---
SFK is one hell of an instance and has great loot for casters especially.
---
I'd say feral, hunter or rogue
---
Feral isn't really weapon dependent and can get really nice pieces via leatherworking
---
Never played feral in classic, just what I heard
---
RemindMe! in 24 hours
---
This is the greatest feeling. I've been getting jumped by rogues and warriors a lot(i'm a mage) and i just root them and kill them, don't even know why they bother trying because i don't think they stand a chance in a legit 1v1. But it's always so so good when you get to stomp someone that jumps you.
---
Level an alt before phase 2. It will be hell trying to level one then.
---
For level grinding, while it doesn't specifically help you grind faster, Skinning is great in order to get more money from your grinding. Make sure to pick up both of the Houndmaster Loksey items from SM Library that give +AP against beasts for the best results.
---
Many rogues will die unnecessarily because they watched this clip.
---
There was a post on this sub that had a map of EK with fishing levels and the level where you get no failures... I can’t find it though...
---
I'm on a PvE server and just getting gables by the fucking mobs.
---
Like every Tom, Dick and Harry giving me quests for up to five levels higher than me which are kinda doable but now I'm training up a new pet who holds about enough aggro as a really cute puppy and I miss every melee attack despite having maxed out melee, unarmed and defense skills now...
---
and he dont att one but with atleast 3 man party
---
Yeah I agree. I didn't like WoW when I played it but I'm on classic and I'm addicted. Every time I'm on and advancing and chatting about some gear or my professions, I just get told to save money. That's not fun, I want to spend my gold. Then I get told raiding is the real game. But I love leveling and exploring. 
---
I have a strong feeling that I'm not gonna stick around after I get towards the endgame because the enjoyment i get will diminish
---
God damnit this is making me want to reroll a warrior.
---
Pack census is between lvl 15-35 so you’re pretty much ahead. I’m way ahead of most of the pack on my server at lvl 40
---
I've heard about this as well, but I never played it. Mostly because I don't like NCSoft and how they treat their western online communities.
---
Glorious!
---
Not scummy, but definitely the rogue experience I was looking for when I rerolled from mage:
---
Took the boat from Booty Bay to Ratchet around lvl 23 (that run through STV is the worst -- a right of God damned passage) in order to get my Expert Cookbook in Ashenvale. I met some Horde on the dock and I /giggled at their /spits while we waited for the boat to come around. We boarded and I accidentally hit one of them and got a knock from the gaurds, but we all just laughed it off, thankfully. We chased each other around the boat a little bit, me looking for a place to stealth since I was out-leveled, out-numbered and had vague flashbacks to getting ganked on the boat back in Vanilla. I ended up sitting on the top deck and all was well by the time we pulled into Ratchet.
---
I get off the boat and there's Horde everywhere. No surprise. But then I vaguely remember something and decide to see what typing "/pvp" into chat does: "You are now flagged for PvP." [Insert surprised Pikachu face]. I quickly re-enter the command and am told I will be unflagged after 5 minutes of non-PvP action. No problem. We're in a city. There are guards everywhere, right? Wrong.
---
I'm heading out of the city into the Barrens where maybe I can find some solitude when this Orc warrior a level above me turns and looks at me. I stop and look at him wondering what he's going to do. He has me targeted. He hits me. I wait to see what happens. No reaction from the guard. Welp, if I'm going to go down, I'm going down fighting. He hits me again before I start waiting him. He's at half health in no time and a crowd of Horde begin to gather. I'm losing health, but I know I'm going to beat him. Some of the crowd begins to get too close for comfort as I sense they see where this is headed. My Horde friends from the ship /cheer me on. 
---
The warrior is almost dead when a lvl 16 Orc warrior steps in to attempt to finish me off. Bad idea buddy. I Gouge him and kill the original warrior before unleashing hell on the little guy. He dies as I round 20% health and 5 more Horde step in to finish the job. Evasion and Sprint are on cooldown. I don't have Vanish yet. I accept my fate knowing that I took two of them down with me.
---
I respawn and the crowd has dispersed as if nothing ever happened. My attackers no where to be seen. I run off into the Barrens toward Ashenvale satisfied with my first plunge into PvP. 
---
Really no other game provides an experience like it.
---
Why?
---
Stonetalon followed by Ashenvale as the other poster mentioned. If you'd like a bit of WPvP to spice things up, Hillsbrad is also pretty great.
---
Some folk would consider his name to be... NSFW
---
Or, let the healer know and let the shaman tank. They are more than ok for the early dungeons like WC. Maybe just switch back to the tank for the last boss, the mossy dude hits hard.
---
No one was honored with hydraxian so we couldn't summon rag. We only wiped once on Baron Geddon because of lack of dispels, but that was fixed on the second attempt
---
God I hate the special snowflake linux users, all the EU servers are low/medium no one can get online not just the linux users, we are not being single out stop reposting that retarded bullshit.
---
Oof
---
The actual heals are about the same, but in classic, healing draws quite a lot of threat. Also buffing seems to cost way more mana.
---
Not so much making money but I feel like I have saved *relative* big money by having a 6, 8, 10 AND 12 slot all drop for me at their relevant levels. 
---
Like I don't know if everything has a tiny chance to drop them but it's always seemed like anything and everything can drop them but they just never do.
---
That being said I'm a hunter so I'm always down one bag slot for my quiver.
---
Oktoberfest? Leveling a 2nd char? Let you mind fly
---
About 50-100 different ways, obviously your are a lazy ass gamer and cant do any research on your own, I mean you cant even post a proper screenshot. So I will let you figure it out for that 1997 pic of a pic you posted
---
Anything you win that’s bind on equip can be sent between characters
---
Low pop is ok if u join the biggest guild
---
Mine on judgement low pop got 600 people cuz the gm uses something that mass invites guildless people
---
No, it's like onions not lasagna.
---
It's just a joke about 69? I think'd, here some wordplay...) Anyway, thx
---
That's okay, you are free to fuck off and leave our trees alone. :)
---
TBH if you're selling something only 5s more then vendor then you're just selling yourself short. You can get more. I saw some LW blue gloves on the AH today for 1s more then vendor price. There was no competition. I know for a fact that it cost just as much to even make the gloves for what he was selling them for. Good for whoever bought them but terrible choice by the person who made them. 
---
That being said, I don't PM him or anything. It's his choice, the economy will sort itself out eventually.
---
Short answer yes. Long answer holy pally is just as good and ad long as your raid has one dwarf priest it's better that the rest be human for the spirit bonus.
---
Absolutely! I would suggest going Skinning and Herbalism while you level to 60, then swapping to Alchemy and dropping skinning.
---
Thrill and agony are definitely the correct terms
---
And on top of him getting late notoriety, he had stream snipers trying to kill him constantly.
---
Uh, wrong thread?
---
They didn't, for sure, it rains all the time in Tiragarde
---
I think this bullshit rumor started when they temporary disabled it during Legion for performance, but I don't even recall it being turned off for that long
---
P3. P2 has no battlegrounds.
---
Keep it and make bank. Easily goes for 300g plus.
---
I'm a Warlock and really enjoy buffing people in the Most ridiculous Places, for example underwater breathing in 1k needels
---
Okey capt swamp
---
Timmaayyyy! ^(The cruel)
---
You can still do that, that's the first thing I tried upon coming across it while quseting nearby, just the big flat brown land still ahaha.
---
As said, if you are hell-bent on going dungeons only till 60, then respecc, but you can heal perfectly fine in shadow specc. anyways, so if you plan to quest at all along the line (Which you should do imo, all the same dungeons over and over can become a bit boring) you should stay shadow.
---
Zero things in that screenshot resemble a screenshot from retail in any way. The character pane, gnome model, and the stats on the item itself (on retail it gives 46 Int, 12 Sta and 10 Crit) would all be significantly different.
---
You have heals, no need to be tanky
---
There are less games supported by linux. Therefore it is inherently worse for playing games in general.
---
Skin herb
---
Swap skin alch at 60
---
Leathers sell very well
---
Gogo engineering getting a hat at 13
---
Never tanked but I agree, hunters actually have it surprisingly easy to manage threat if they don't spam multishot and focus the main target.
---
Opening with multishot is a sure aggro pull though.
---
I agree with your message but have to interject for a moment.
---
What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU+Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system, which is made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
---
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
---
That was provided by addons
---
I agree with this, and this is why I'm sort of an advocate for not continuing Vanilla WoW.
---
I would prefer the approach of taking all the good things from all the expansions. I would like a game with the graphics of retail, questing like classic, dps rotations of WotLK / Cata, and the raid/dungeon tiering of TBC.
---
Not being able to get a replacement instantly teleported to you forces you to accept and help new players.
---
Its not necessarily the community that's better. The environment forces people to be better to each other.
---
Finally a word about Fireball dot, thank you.
---
Anyone know of any addon that does a good job of filtering the chat? Staring at the chat looking for a group with all the spam flying by makes my head hurt so would be great being able to filter out all the spam for dungeons that I am not looking to run anyway.
---
Classic will last for years, no reason to race to the end. Should be finished building my PC by the end of this year
---
You can definitely wait to do professions until you hit 60. I personally will be doing 2 gathering professions as I level up, because you do make good money out of them, but if you want to hit 60 quickly don't do professions.
---
Except first aid. First aid is excellent and will help you level more quickly, so you should try to do it as you go.
---
exactly
---
This! Personally as a pally I buff without the expectation of being buffed back. But it is nice though. But I do make a extra effort for warriors, rogues and hunters because I can.
---
It's not. It's ElvUI with very minor changes from default.
---
Tell that to everyone whos been leveling to 60 on private servers perfectly fine without shitty layering.
---
Bro, watch another stream.  Or, you know, play without watching a stream at the same time...
---
The way you have your bars set up makes me want to close a car door on my fingers
---
In my defense I'm NA. It's a poor man's Vanish.
---
I read this in a goblin voice even though they aren't playable in classic.
---
I think it just always feels like that, you mostly see people around your own level. That being said, lvl 40 zones on my server is pretty much unplayable because of the insane amounts of people. I literally had to go to bed early and wake up at 3 am to complete certain quests
---
Did you disable glow? Your game looks so different
---
Wtf! When i jump i fall of the train for IF 😂😂😂😂
---
30 warlock, 24 warrior, 21 druid, too many dope classes to just play one imo
---
Fucking NAILED it
---
THank you.
---
I mostly agree with your argument but just like to add something.
---
What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU _plus_ Linux.

---
OSRS is basically Runescape Classic. To keep it relevant the devs periodically release new content designed in the same old artstyle, gameplay and difficulty.
---
So its basically going another route from the modern version of the game, and graphicly it looks like its been stuck in 2007. Its like an alternate reality. Its pretty cool.
---
Demoralising shout is a good start. Otherwise just get two maybe 3 sunders on the main target then switch around a little so that each mob in the pack is hit every once in a while.
---
Disengage is very mana expensive relatively and only a small lowering of threat.
---
You realise a screenshot cannot show how the game looks like from the observer’s perspective? Which is the entire point of this image.
---
ElvUI is THE best, you can move almost anything and it looks so neat.
---
oh and how would you have it set up
---
This is classic, dude is going to need that 2 hours to farm on an alt because he can't afford any more fuckin' bags on his main.
---
Afaik pickpocketing is weak now
---
He's gonna be salty all game because I'm pretty sure undercutting is how you sell shit.
---
Chaaaaaaaaaaarge !!! Miss !!! miss !! parry !! out of rage ! out of rage ! out of rage ,,,,,, dodge ! !
---
For fuck sake !
---
Hillsbrad aint quite popular on alliance side
---
I got a cat at the time I started playing as a teen. He died 6 days ago in my arms. I resubbed wow to escape the sorrow.
---
And it works at escaping reality a little too well, but I can't complain.
---
My father will hear about this!
---
Dwarf gets free wins vs rogues
---
Also helps with hunters
---
Won't that tab be permanently lit up though? Or can you disable notifications
---
People like buying from me, I think it’s because my characters name is just "Ha"
---
It’s not a vanish. It’s a poor man’s stealth only useful for warriors and hunters who want to eat stealthed or guard a flag. But rogues shouldn’t even have shadowmeld on their actionbar.
---
While there were more than one change I did not like, including dungeon finder's auto grouping,  I can pin point the one change that broke wow for me.   It was CRZ (Cross Realm Zones).   It used to be you would run into the same people again and again, and eventually add some of them to your friends list, or invite them to your guild etc.   After that other players become other NPCs but that competed for the same resources as you.  In addition it broke the world,   I would try to goto the arena, or the fishing tournament at the time for my server.  However when I got to it, I was put on another server with a different time.  A few times of that and I gave up trying to go to events.   Also, one time I sighted the Time Lost Drake,   I flew after it and we switched zones, I went to a different server.   It made the world no longer a virtual world, and exposed it as a game world, when the population and times just had no stability.
---
Yeah your right. We get the honour system but no BGs in P2.
---
Maybe it's just cause I'm playing on a PVE server for wimps and babies, so no one bothers us. 😁
---
I thought there would be a TON of 60s by now... So like maybe 2% are 60s?
---
....No.
---
My friend is playing WoW for the first time as a Priest and loves healing random people. 
---
He learnt a valuable lesson last night when he healed someone running away from 6 untagged mobs lol.
---
As a priest myself this has been my experience in dungeons so far,
---
Tank pulls, i cast renew, wand tank target
---
90% percent of the time thats it and we move on, for a boss i throw shadow word pain on it
---
Only time my party has wiped was to drowning in bfd.... because we tunnel visioned naga underwater lol
---
My decision tree while wanding looks something like this:
---
Tank health drops below 70% health: cast lesser heal
---
Below 50%: heal
---
Below 30% flash heal
---
Below 20% shield + flash heal
---
I pull aggro: cast fade
---
Dps bulls aggro: cast shield (+ renew if they got hit)
---
Most the time my mana stays around 75-80% only time i might mana dump is when we pull like 6+mobs and i play triage, then it gets fun,
---
Turn the fucking layering off Blizzard. People rolled on a PVP server to fucking PVP not be hidden from half the population on the server ffs.
---
Best arena balancing? Have you played a clothie during the arp era? :p
---
Though tbh it was super hilarious and fun imo.
---
If you think more profit can be made, why don't you buy they "underpriced" item and relist it yourself? That's how trading works IRL.
---
Rerolled Warlock (now level 11)  from Shaman (level 22).
---
Hey man I guess I should have clarified that I don’t care what people play and play some oddball combinations myself haha, but he was asking about specs and that made me think he was inquiring about optimization which is 100% an orc for the warrior! No need to hate, play what you want
---
I tried to play a Human as I did all that time ago.
---
I was just left with the memories of doing the zone over and over in my younger years, and getting burned out.
---
So I went back to my main, glad I rolled a Forsaken.
---
YOU HAVE MAH’ ATTENSHUN
---
wowinterface.com
---
Since about 15 years.
---
yeah true but the games I'm currently playing I don't see a difference in ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but classic
---
Are Resto Druids that bad? I've seen videos saying that they're kinda average for end game healing, specially in PVE. I used to play Resto Druids on Retail and the tons of instants really made me fell in love with them.   
---
Also can I level up as a Resto? or should i go for Balance? I just want to heaaal!
---
Id have kept all the numbered slots on the bottom bar, it just looks so weird inverted like that.
---
Personally I use, OneBag3, RealMobHealth, VendorPrices and the one for a basic swing timer.
---
I might also add one later which shows the duration of my debuffs on the enemy so I know when to recast exactly.
---
There is a huge selection so you can pick what you want really.
---
I'm pretty sure you can.   It is still sexy though.
---
you can kite him easily as mage with frostbolt rank1
---
While new raids would be cool, I'm more excited about more mid game content. Such as new professions, level dungeons, and class quests.
---
Something I think about often is a weekly pvp event where Thrall travels to Stormwind to raid. Make it a random time each week and give him an exclamation mark 1 hour before he starts traveling so word can spread for people to join. That to me sounds like great content that doesn't push power over what classic is now.
---
don't download dbm or bosswings and it is done
---
Troll is nowhere near as good as gnome for mages
---
No, haven't had any issues so far. Or at least I havent noticed any.
---
...and if you've never been to the skill trainer boy is your life about to change. Also, if you've never been to a skill trainer and you're level 21 you are my hero.
---
So addons to see what mobs are casting existed in 2006 also.
---
DBM maybe came around later but not much, and tbh I still don’t think it’s necessary, just pay attention
---
The game is full of people who have done this over and over either in this version of the game or another. If you're in a group and things are moving too fast for you make sure you let people know you aren't as familiar with the game as they are. Most people will help you out.
---
Also for the same reason people try to find farming shortcuts to get XP to level up and later on earn gold. As a first time player I suggest you skip these kind of activities. They trade a long really enjoyable game-play loop for a shorter really boring one which makes sense for veterans but not so much for new players.
---
Are you horde or alliance Fairbanks?
---
BGs are not in for another year or so, you realise that?
---
Yeah just buy your food buffs instead of leveling cooking if you want to. This guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
---
He is the one!
---
What are some trade goods that circulate well in the AH? Something that people will always need, regardless of Phase, level, etc.?
---
Yeah you get it later.
---
&gt;;)
---
Mate I still miss it even when I'm 10x closer, haha. This is amazing, good job!
---
ElvUI is just a newer version of TukUI. Same developer, same website, same code... mostly. ElvUI has a few extra features and customizations.
---
That's what I thought, but once the downvote brigade comes out, there isnt any point in trying to defend yourself tbh.
---
I need a solid guide that follows a similar strat
---
Twink 39 sword 
---
most twinks are 19
---
And that epic isnt some preraid sword
---
Maybe 30-50?
---
I'll stop playing WoW Classic long before I start using Windows :)
---
Same! Going back on the 12th, full pre-BIS except Blackcrow and doing MC tomorrow. :D
---
Alright I will make sure to ask for help. I do understand how the first time is more just getting to know the game and fun with it and not just to level 60.  Thanks for the tips
---
That makes sense
---
You can simply make the caps disappear in your interface options.
---
12 Warrior, 6 Rogue, 16 Mage, 15 Priest
---
Yeah, figured I was wrong after all the replies lol. It's been a while. Elv has written tons of code on top of Tukz' creation, TukUI.
---
Being a healer in Deadmines was an excercise in futility. 
---
Nobody wanted to let anyone rest, drink, eat, nothing.
---
Wiped again and again and again.
---
&gt; Insist the gold is split immediately after each boss. Then at least only the last can be stolen.
---
You will also spend 3 extra hours doing this. Worth iiiit.
---
I believe it does scale up, but you still have a chance to pull lower level fish so it does take more casts than doing it in an appropriately leveled zone. Not 100% sure on that though.
---
Yea, that won’t be cool, that’s why gotta get all Alts to decent lvls before phase 2, when is phase 2 anyway?
---
Take picture upload too Reddit that easy I don't understand why so many people get upset about this, does it bother you if someone buy a flavoured icecream you don't personally enjoy 😂
---
nice!
---
It’s not a big deal, but it shouldn’t be added. And it won’t.
---
As a tank, thanks for those 30 min buffs.  I either have to buy pots and spells or level up my cooking to make some tasty treats that give stam buffs.
---
Bro don’t be nervous! People are regularly AFK for a few mins for irl shit or just skinning mobs and no one ever says anything. Don’t worry about your DPS I think anyone who posts meters in a non dedicated instance speed run would get laughed out of the group.
---
Dungeons are great you should check em out. In terms of your gear question, no clue sorry. 
---
Source: I play with 300+ ms and am sometimes wanding and pet auto attacking and no one ever complains.
---
Really!? That’s great news. Do you know it that hides my cape for just me, or everyone else too?
---
I didn’t say negatively, and obviously all the changes over time people didn’t think would be negative, and most of them were good, but the problem is figuring out where to draw the line. 
---
The easiest place to draw the line is saying, you want vanilla, you get vanilla, no changes.
---
Be warned that it's not a copy of WAR retail though, they're changing many things to try to accommodate their smaller population
---
I find pushing groups limits in dungeons more fun than solo questing. It’s a matter of opinion. I look forward to SM because that’s how I did those levels in classic too.
---
If there is a tank anyway at all involved in my team I turn growl off it's not too hard lol
---
holy shit. Pug &gt; mageblade
---
Hold in there. Warrior only get better with time and gear is very important.
---
Do some dungeons man! You're not gonna be able to do poorly if you're not tanking or healing tbh. Just go for it and have fun.
---
Again, all of these things are irrelevant.
---
The reality is that the need before greed system states is one where item upgrade outvalues gp value regardless of scale of either of these things.
---
If you want to try to add a bunch of rationalizations for why you think that shouldn’t be the case, fine, but its not how it functions normally. 
---
The balance of your armor types in your group is always going to lead to unfair competition/ monopoly for your group. Even with BOP’s. 
---
Really the argument you’re making is just as applicable to BOE greens and BOP blues. The only difference you’re drawing is some arbitrary gold value difference. 
---
Forelands trashmov farming is not at all the same as this. People run trashmob farms with the explicit purpose of making money of BOE’s. It’s crazy that you’re comparing farming trash for selling BoE’s with clearing content for upgrades.
---
The whole reason people do dungeons is for upgrades, not for gold. If we were farming dungeons for gold then maybe it’d be a different story. If the item wasn’t really an upgrade, it’d be a differnt story.
---
However, when the item is an upgrade, and the only reason people are in there is for xp and the chance of an upgrade, you cannot apply the same logic and looting rules as you’d apply in a group where everyone is just there to get BoE’s to sell on the AH. 
---
The two situations are just completely different, in fact, your whole argument of what’s fair and unfair lies partially in the belief that the person who is needing on the gear because it’s an upgrade won’t equip it and would sell it instead, and the only reason you’re making that assumption is because you’re still carrying the mentality of a firelands BOE trash farmer, thinking everyone is just trying to make gold.
---
[Comparison](https://www.gamespot.com/videos/world-of-warcraft-classic-vs-battle-for-azeroth-gr/2300-6450936/) between Classic and Retail.
---
The majority of players will have the same luck overall upto 40. It's a bell curve. Everyone I know is respeccing or never using the ah and then complaining about not having gold. I guarantee any decent player ends up with 100g by 40 100% of the time.
---
For everyone else too. You can do the same with your helmet too.
---
enjoy the raid man, it was quite fun!
---
Ayy ladders
---
I meant not only the quest rewards, but also selling quest rewards, selling the junk and so on. I'm farming quite a bit, put roughly 10 hours into fishing, farming trolls in STV yesterday for silk. I just want to avoid to much grinding tbh\^\^

druid code gets the spotlight, but everyone forgets about the rogue salute - distract each other, laugh, and head over to ravenholt to train with master kang.

---
What gameplay changes are there when you can change pircings or hair color ? 
---
NON because everything still is the same. 
---
&gt;  Am I missing stuff? 
---
Yes valid arguements
---
you should probably try harder content in retail if this is the case, remember retail has a wide spread of difficulties
---
Every little change takes us a bit further from Vanilla WoW and opens doors for other changes, "We can change our appearance, why not give us transmog?". Also Vanilla WoW was about identity, you look how you look and can't change it. When I meet my friend warrior he looks particular way and it will always stay that way, not change every two days.
---
basically the same as unemployed :P.
---
Jk enjoy, but that's what I am saying. No way I can get to 60 this fast and remain employed.
---
I wouldn't really consider the hairdresser on par with what changes have been made to the game to this day. You have the options to change hair styles and colors. Nothing drastic. It's not even QoL, it's a harmless feature. Doesn't affect the core of the game in any way. 
---
I'm not sure I'm understanding the distaste for this feature. Seems out of place
---
Oh heck yeah. Thanks!
---
Really enjoying the classic graphics. I was also surprised to see how little the graphics have actually changed in all that time yet the modern game is laggy as hell on older hardware. Personally I prefer the old water to the updated but that might partly be my gfx card.
---
Balls of Steel
---
I would say coyotes in badlands. As a mage I was able to AoE grind them and some buzzards. I am also a skinner. On my server anything less than thick hide is basically stuff I vendor along with greys and wicked claws/etc. Got lucky with 3 green BoE, sold for a total of 8g. I would say around 1h there I had made maybe 17ish gold. I was lucky to be able to find large packs fairly close to group up and AoE.
---
Basically 8 gold from the 3 BoE ( 1 vendored and 2 posted to AH), around 8g from vendoring greys/whites and skin. Some thick hide yielded around 1g80s on the AH.  Though I had most of the thick hide from before grinding the spot, I did not get many thick hide from the coyotes.
---
Always make sure to tell the tank that you need to drink before next pull. Tanks usually just want to keep going, but if you get a big pull and you are 50% mana or less it's most likely a wipe. I just did Uldaman and I had to drink after almost every pull (I had to heal pretty intensively because we didn't have a very good comp).  
---
Also, sometimes it's worth letting the tank drop pretty low so you can get your mp5 going, then burst heal him to full and let him drop down again for your mp5 to regen.
---
Depends how you define it. If we define it as all chances of having 2 people have the same high roll it's  4*(99/100)^3*(1/100). And then for the second roll with only 2 people it would be 1/100. So in total 4*(99/100)^3*(1/100)^2=0.04%. But there are several other ways to count it depending on exactly what you want to know ;)

-1 iOS, -2 huntard.
---
don t bother with any suggestions to add anything to classic. the community is extremely toxic about it. there are many purist zealots who go nuts if you want to move an npc 1 inch to the right.
---
while I agree that many things should not be added to classic, things like a hairdresser or transmog would surely not harm the gameplay. but hey, they are having fun THEIR OBSESSIVE way. Why should they let YOU have fun and not flame you into oblivion if you dare make a suggestion?
---
Unfortunately people can t accept that classic has disadvantages too, like bfa and not all improvements made over the many expansions to the game were bad. But discussing this is a lost cause.
---
As someone who played classic back then and bfa now, I like both of them. I am having a lot of fun in both, although i am playing classic more lately. I would like to see a future wow expansion tilted more towards classic elements. Classic could use some enhancements too, but there is no chance you will get them. Hell, people want to get The burning crusade later but without flying although the expansions is specifically made with flight as a mechanic.

whatever

Hey Tzzs :),

wie dir ja bereits geschrieben wurde gibt es da kein direktes addon für. Am einfachsten schreibst du dir ein Makro unter einen deiner Spells je nach dem was du spielst bei mir ist es z.B. :

/dismount

/Cast Sinister Strike(Rank8)

My first thought was to sandbox the client and feed it the dlls it needs. I wasn't too far! I get it it's probably murky waters but the expected answer to a ddos attack from a multi billion dollars company is to just buy more bandwidth instead of fucking customers so all in all i'd say it's legitimate.
---
“Thank you for biggest post” lol what
---
That was amazing
---
Mmmmmm tough choice, it would depend on your playstyle and what you would get the most enjoyment out of while keeping the future in mind. Good luck dude!
---
Playing with a first-timer in his 30s.. We became chill from playing the game, wiping a hundred times, losing need rolls to hunters, getting kicked from parties, getting corpse-camped for hours.
---
My friend is raging at all the little things while I am just giggling softly because I have learnt this is not sustainable in the long run.
---
We are the old guard because we have seen all that shit and said no to it.
---
Time is money friend! Farming mats will cost you a LOT of time that could be spent on getting gold to just buy mats.
---
1. Visit your class trainer every two levels.
---
2. Get extra bags ASAP.
---
3. If you play hunter you need to visit a pet trainer as well tp upgrade your pet’s abilities.
---
4. “LFG” means “looking for group”
---
5. Repair and resupply (food/water) regularly.
---
6. Learn professions related to your class to maximize utility. 
---
That’s all I got.
---
Can't layer while dead or in combat so you can still get camped.
---
only one faction can complete yeti quest at any given time, it's the law.
---
Please don't to it. Give them to the next mage who conjure food for you and you'll make a very happy man I swear.
---
Won’t be saying that when you have a quest in water and you realise how short the classic breath timers are.
---
Weapon speed has been normalized for abilities so a slow weapon and a fast weapon with the same dps do the same amount of damage with Mortal Strike for example.
---
No worries, I'll just be considerate and be at the dungeon while forming the group ;)

It's cards above 32GB that (should) use ExFAT. Some devices accept oversized FAT32 formatted cards, others don't.

Seems weird that "bad servers" would kick in two weeks after launch when there has been practically no downtime until this.
---
Shadowfang Keep, Blackfathom deeps and Razorfen Kraul, you mean?
---
Those add-ons are allowed and exist because they aren't considered cheating. A lot of much crazier shit used to exist and was functionally broken by the devs when deemed too strong.  Seeing what the enemy is casting is just really basic stuff that should have been in from the start and eventually was put into the game natively even.

It isn't.

In my opinion the best starting area is night elf followed by orc/troll. Would recommend one of those races.

Guild name definitely doesn't check out, you was pretty decisive with your decision to jump.

I sheep low hp horde, then wand them once they're fully healed to break poly. They attack me afterwards every single time

Turns out there are people out there that for one reason or another don't want to go to that vendor and will buy the item on the auction house with markup for the convenience of it. OP is just fulfilling a demand, it's not like he's forcing anyone to buy his books.

I'm not sure its possible, I just statically wand. However I'm a wow first timer so I would not know I guess. There used to be something called melee weaving in between wands but that's apparently not in classic.
---
Thank you! \^\^
---
It's an upgrade for a spec that doesn't actually benefit the raid. If your argument is that it doesn't matter whether the spec benefits the raid because the content is easy, then why shouldn't the warrior roll for it and upgrade his rp set?
---
Clique is basically a shortcut for mouseover macros.  You can bind any key to cast whatever spell at anything you're moused-over.  Or you can bind clicks, or shift-clicks, etc.  You can even bind actual macros to events.  It's pretty versatile and I see why a lot of folks like it. 
---
Personally, I use a combination of HealBot and mouseover macros.  It's nice to be able to drop form and cast a Regrowth or whatever just by clicking the HealBot frame, without giving up a Bear/Cat form keybind.

I would avoid leveling as resto its straiht up painful. Level as Feral and just keep caster gear up to snuff. if you really want, level first 5 into feral for reduced energy/rage cost then put enough Talants into resto to get Reduced Healing touch cast time THEN put the rest into feral. Its sorta hybrid but hey, you wouldent be a druid otherwise.

You can tell he is a private server player because he is talking to someone.

What are you even doing on this sub if you don't like the game lol

True story...this is what Paladins dream about.

I was at 20g when I startet grinding the hell out of SM at level 32.. when I dinged 40 I was at 86g
---
You missed your chance to name yourself Outkast
---
Yea unbelievable sustain. If you do it right you have never to drink or eat even if you farm Organe mobs.
---
Don't have huge expectations if you have limited play time. WoW just isn't the game for that. Enjoy your ride, keep doing instances or quests. Warlock and Priest can't "really" AOE. So aim to do as many quests as possible if you want to level fast with limited time.
---
Yeah I mean there is a big difference between banter and full on white nationalist dog whistling. My Barrens chat was filled with the latter.  Other times it has been funny and full of nonsense
---
Fuck I hate muppets that carry on about this kind of thing.
---
There's only two possible situations here, either they're over-inflating the price in which case they're not going to sell much anyway, or you are truly listing the item for less than it's worth. 
---
But if you are listing the item for less than it's worth, why would they not just buy it and relist it at the price they believe it's worth??? You get your sale, they get their extra profit?
---
Thats what I like about classic. You're 26, basically a rookie. One of many thousand. You look like trash, not like the chosen one next to the other thousand epic looking chosen ones.
---
Could add transmog while we're at it! /s
---
Not even close, all zones at around lvl 40 are unplayable at peak times, I literally have to wake up at 3 am to complete certain quests.
---
People wanted Vanilla WoW, not Vanilla WoW with improvements, just like it was years ago, not a new kind of game in old zones. Let those "purist zealots" have the game they fought so hard for...
---
Dude... i had someone do that. I was drinking because we flew upto that point and was nearly oom, tank face rolled right up to him and got squished quick i was able to keep another dps alive for a second then it was me 1vBoss, luckly i was able to keep my wits about me and shadow word pain and kited him around the room till he died. It felt magical as a lvl 19 priest, more epic then most my raiding ive done in any expansion!
---
Prospector axe at lvl 14 day 2 ofc classic 1 gold ... lasted me all the way till WW axe!
---
Thanks will do yeah I'm planning to play as a mage.
---
 (and now I have another reason too).
---
It's been resolved for me in the end, but yes, I do not buy the ISP bullshit for a second.
---
I honsestly don't remember ever playing an mmo or mmo expansion launch that didn't at least claim they were being DDoS'd.
---
Some alliance mage saved me from getting ganked earlier (I’m horde). The rogue that ganked me would’ve honestly lost but there were 5 other people there so there’s no guarantee I live.
---
I've done the same thing with priest, even 'taunting' via mind blast.
---
I dont know how blizzard wants to handle classic its fine how it is yes but when we are at the point where Burning crusade should come out and we run out of content for classic what then? 
---
I know those things are far in distance and I enjoy the journey till i get there but then we only have the option to get new content and features if they are good or bad, no one can say until we get them.
---
No he did not
---
&gt; paladin tanks aren't good at all, if you still want to be one cool, but they're not good.
---
No you are wrong. They aren't the absolute best. That is your problem with them. They aren't useless or not good at all. They just aren't the best. Also I don't play a Paladin or Alliance at all but im also not a mouthbreathing idiot who thinks you can only bring the absolute best class to Classic raids.
---
Also you didn't answer my question. What does taunting have to do with tanking in MC?
---
Farm gear and consumables?
---
Good luck. 😇
---
lmao same
---
I use esf and bind all the keys around to abilities. Then shift plus all those keys. Also google some druid macros, they can save you a lot of bindings.
---
I mean it's more so a personal problem. I want to play  a healer, not a *really* dull dps.

---
Your gear and titles are your achievements.
---
It's kind of a big deal even though it isn't. Every small adjusted made that's similar to retail will slowly change the feel of Classic straight to Retail.
---
So even though at times I wish I could just change my hair, I still think it's good that it's not a feature.
---
Spec to sub (12 points - Master of Deception 5/5, Elusiveness 2/2, Camouflage 5/5), got at least 70 lock picking, be lvl38+, and you can do SM Library stealth runs. It's around 10-20g/h. Worth a try.
---
Quests from goblins give money as reward pretty much always.
---
Still down for me, that Ddos attack is hitting them hard haha
---
Yeah I'm 42 and looks like a realistic time would be 3 weeks. 
---
Before wow launched I was hoping to get 60 within a month but looks like it will be a week late.
---
Bags are the easy one.
---
It's a bit weird because as you said sometimes the wand attack stays on and sometimes it doesn't. You just have to watch the icon and press the button again if the attack gets disabled.
---
Alts. Farm. Do 5 mans, help more guild members get attuned for stuff. Do the to raids each week. Maybe go outside or even play another game sometimes or read a book.
---
You're less powerful and really have to work for what you have. Also less class pruning leads to some fun encounters since everything isn't blandly balanced. Vanilla is essentially DnD the video game. That's why I love it.
---
That’s pretty lit
---
I don't blame blizzard for doing this. I love Linux but it's an unsupported platform for their software. If they feel it will help their network security to ban it then they're correct to do so.
---
You can hide the helm AND the cape.

&gt;  ICMP packets

ICMP isn't prioritised at all..

That’s exactly what I think about when I lifetap. Because I’ve healed before and I know they’re looking at healbot just watching my health disintegrate

Please add achievements. Please.

Paladins are healers in plate. They have a 3 in 1 dispel. They have free movement buff on short CD. Bubbles. They are the #1 pvp healer and it’s not even close

Grind scarlet monastry.. ez gold while still pushing your level. Sat there from 34 to 40 and made 68g in that span
---
Haha nice whatever gets the job done
---
41 warrior to lvl with my buddy, 38 paladin when he is not there
---
I second this i don't need those achievments ... people will start shit like link ... to get in group.
---
Yeah you can think of it exactly like that. The login server acts as a restful API that authenticate you and then passing your request onto the next served (game server) or whatever is next. If any of these services get flooded you can't get to the next one
---
But what kind of frames you dropping?
---
Well, it's MC in 1.12 with all classes rehauled and everything IS easier. If we played on 1.2 or something it'd be quite hard.
---
I had a similar experience the other day, which ended in me putting the rogue on ignore.
---
The first chest I won the roll for, inside were 4 liferoot and the rogue asked if he could have them for alchemy. I only have herbalism and while I'm stockpiling herbs, I thought why not?
---
Chest number 2 was locked, I won the roll again but he just went right ahead and opened it, paused for about 10 seconds obviously making a conscious decision before just taking everything.
---
To make matters worse, I summoned this guy without any sort of thanks. I think it's down to you how you feel and ultimately it doesn't matter too much, but by god, I will never be seen with that rogue again.
---
... because many of us like it. You can't give an objective answer to this question. Classic does many things different than retail, that's pretty much all about it.
---
&gt; got a good engineering career
---
Gnome or Gobllin?
---
It took me 4 kills for 4 hooves, but like, 90 plainstalkers for the beaks.
---
As a veteran myself, I never quite understood what exactly "military grade" means.  Speaking anecdotally here, COTS (commercial off the shelf) replacement parts were generally more reliable (and significantly cheaper) than our own parts.
---
There are so many people there already you will struggle to get continuous spawns.
---
Well if it turns into this, then theres hundreds of players fighting in one small area, freeing up tons of room in the rest of the zone/world to quest.
---
The words that gave birth to a legend.
---
Is the 5s profit before or after the AH takes a cut?
---
Layering saved classic launch.
---
Try playing on a private server with just a fraction of classic population, it's literally unplayable. I played on a server with like 4k people on before classic launched, and it took me HOURS to complete something as the zeebra quest in barrens, and it literally took me days to complete the raptor one. 
---
Sure massive pvp brawls are fun every now and then, but it sure as fuck isn't fun spending 6 hours getting from lvl 19 to 20
---
You can heal regardless of spec, leveling resto would be horrible. Feral is honestly the way to go for levelling efficiency 
---
But resto is great, just has different strengths than a priest or pally. You would be raid healing more than tank healing during raids. And your utility would go a long way too
---
This is so true, because i've also been playing dnd for the past year and there was no game in any form that compaired to this untill i started playing classic again.
---
This is why u skip escorts on pvp realms
---
One tip is to keep some lower rank heals on your actionbars, sometimes you do not need the highest rank spell and spamming lower rank ones can be a good option when OOM
---
\- The social experience was better, because you had to group up for a lot of things and everyone in your group was on the same server
---
\- On retail you can use lfg for everything and don't have to write a single line, that's just like an offline game
---
\- no silly catch up mechanics, if you achieve something, it won't fully lose it's worth. On retail, everything you achieve will lose it's meaning after 6 month
---
\- epics feel more epic :)
---
Thats what killed wow. The anonymous masses boarding on, misguided from powercreep and min-max goals. The entire thing is that classic wow was a playground for people willing to commit themselves. And then this "i dobt have time but pay the same"-mentality creeped in. Old wow was so good, you did neither need nor want anything else.
---
But todays society wants to have everything. Right now. Without cost and effort.
---
While it is definitely true that the timely use of a Hunter pet as an offtank can make the difference between a wipe or not, based on current stereotypes you first need to find a Hunter who can do basic pet control before you can ask for intelligent offtanking.
---
For me it's about the difficulty and that you have to work for things in classic. In Retail you just go like a train through everything, loot one mob and get it all. Free epics everywhere and you wanna do a dungeon, que up, continue to play until it pops run like a train and be done in 10-15 minutes. 
---
In classic if you do a SM run as alliance you have to spend 30 minutes just to get there
---
I'm using this one but as far as I understand, I'm only able to see other people's threat if they also have the addon installed? Are there any threat meters that don't have that restriction? It's kind of pointless to see my threat if I don't know what threat the tank is at.
---
Guns, scopes, maybe ez-thro dynamite.
---
If all you want to do is heal there's no good reason not to other than the fact that solo questing and farming later on will suck.  You do not really need to go holy until MC.
---
Go the the main page, on the right side, pick community options drop down and select "Edit Flair". This is on desktop, so not sure how it's done on mobile.
---
Then you shouldn't have picked a PvP realm. You knew that ganging is part of the questing process. If you wanted controlled PvP, go to PvE realm and enable your PvP flag when you wish.
---
I’m an actual vanilla player who has also played private servers and hasn’t got 100g by 40 this time.
---
Tell me, what area of skill or knowledge am I lacking which has prevented this? 
---
You have extremely limited experience and found that on this occasion you found it easy therefore it must happen like that every time. Don’t disparage others because they weren’t as luck, particularly given there is no skill involved, only luck. Doing so makes you a moron.
---
No, that's just how AV was (pre-nerf).
---
and free action potions, which prevents you from stuns and immobilizes for 30 seconds! Run around with frost res potion on and pop free action and youre basically a mage killing machine, bonus points if you use skull for poly counter.
---
But the fact you need 3 separate items to EVEN FIGHT A MAGE. is absolutely awful.
---
200iq
---
lol to that last sentence. I don't want to change my hair, I just noticed it wasn't in the game.
---
Take a game like OSRS for example. It restarted as well, but it didn't stay exactly the same as it was in 2007. the game progressed, it received updates based on polled player voting. So, it basically became an alternate timeline. A blend of old mechanics with new updates like quests, items, etc that were never in the original game.
---
I don't really care if there is hairdresser tbh, but completely staying away from changes even this minor is not a good thing imo.
---
Launching this type of stuff is basically like banging out a ~~webpage~~ app in a WSYWIG editor and then proceeding to call yourself a developer.  This DDoS stuff is script kiddie bush league bullshit that, while not potentially done by a child or teenager, is likely being done by someone who is just as immature as a child or teenager.
---
It’s usually smooth but I get an occasional drop every 2mins or so, depending on the connection to the pc

---
Warlocks are stronk. fire ward yourself, decurse and sheep wlock. Then shatter his vw (force sac). Cs shadow and just nuke as hard as you can, Frostbolt + Cone shatter. 
---
If he has a succu just add it into your shatter and kill it asap (you don't want to get charmed, unless UD then whatever). 
---
Personally, at lower levels like 50ish (where i'm at atm) I just prefer to nuke wlock, cs shadow and enjoy.
---
Speaking as someone who's salaried myself, my salary doesn't change whether I work 3 hours in a day or 10.  And I've done both plenty of times.  Which do you think I prefer?  I've left for new jobs at higher pay plenty of times because of the excessive hours at the old employer.
---
It's not targeting the game servers themselves, it's targeting specific service providers. So yes to answer your question it is a US problem primarily
---
Having a 1 year old does that to you!
---
Yes. It applies in BGs too.
---
We used to have our main raid tanks run flags in WSG.
---
Oh, yeah true lol
---
Go back to Slashdot
---
For me I don't want them to release a new level cap keep it 60 but new content why not bring out tier sets for some of the other specs give people more chances to play speccs they enjoy but keeping the overall itemisation stat weights the same as currently. Don't make the gear better maybe just make it different. Different looks different bonuses etc
---
So I hope they launch new servers running TBC and leave classic as classic.
---
Most people don’t play classic because they want new content, quite the opposite. Shit, none of it is new content to myself and lots of other players. It’s nostalgia.
---
I do too but why would he be playing with [Micro Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines)?
---
Honestly...
---
I don’t see it happening anytime soon. I imagine at some point there will be some basic features added and this will be one of them.

Take no notice of the cry baby autsics in here screeching about how a minor change like this is bad, they genuinely can’t help it due to their mental condition.
---
I expected you to dc right before you hit the ground lol
---
32 been leveling a undead priest. I'm trying to stay focused on it so not doing an alt for the time being. Alt will be rogue or shaman I think
---
Weird, I've had the same experience with the horde so far.
---
- Don't let some "veteran" Elitist take your fun away. Just because someone played over a decade ago doesn't mean he has the right to tell you how to have fun.
---
- Don't use Rockbiter when you are in a dungeon.

Would you say humans are bad for it?
---
damn i can't wait for level 32 on nelf my hunter  
---
for reasons...

(pet prowl rank 1 + shadowmeld = reasons i'll spend weeks in Hillsbrad)
---
&gt; I had originally made my druid to be moonkin or resto, but people need tanks a lot. So I started offering to tank as a way to get into DM and WC and at first I disliked it but then I found it kind of fun. These old school dungeons can be really difficult, not being careful can get you very easily killed. I took to it like water though, possibly from my experience on my paladin tank I played in BC.
---
You pretty much described the feeling I have when shaman tanking :)
---
Dank dir. Mit Makros geht das natürlich, aber ich dachte ich könnte mir ersparen für alle Spells solch Makros zu schreiben und einfach ein addon nutzen. Meine größere Hoffnung war das ich einfach die Option dafür nickt finden konnte :D
---
A teleport platform is more in theme with the giant spaceship castle prison garden.
---
The thing is that unless you do big pulls all the time you have a relatively big amount of downtime, especially on dungeon bosses. Raid healing is different in that regard. I mean, I've seen so many healers who desperately want to keep their tanks at 100% HP as soon as those get a teeny tiny scratch while it isn't even necessary.
---
You aren't **just** a healer. You **suport** your group as well, meaning dispells, possible taunts etc (as a druid for example), maybe even kiting in some form. And doing DPS is one of those things. I mean, what are **you** doing when there's no group damage and the tank is allright? Are you just standing around looking at a wall? Healers have the benefit of being able to do two things, not just one like DPS.
---
Hell, I've done this to good effect in both WoW and EVE. If you have enough money to throw at it, and it's a slow enough moving item, just buy the stock and relist.
---
Good thing thats in Thousand Needles then
---
My bad. It looks like it makes sense, but my knowledge about that field is limited (to say the least). Than you for providing further, more accurate, reading.
---
Main goal of the game is to have fun. Secondary goals include doing quests, reaching levels, obtaining a mount on lvl x&gt;=40, leveling professions...
---
Tell them that if they life tap you are not topping them up.
---
If there is a mana or food break and they don’t utilise it at all, then I won’t heal them at all.
---
There are a few items needed for quests. They always sell decently. I believe it's the first level of scope from Engineering for a quest in Ashenvale. Frost Oil, Gyrochronatom, Bronze Framework, and a few other things.
---
Every high end raw material. 
---
Tissue, mineral, herb, meat/fish, leather, etc. 
---
Basically anything that is used to make lvl60 consummables.
---
Thanks a lot i will give that a try when im Home
---
What I like about classic is there seems to be a little bit more Alliance/Horde balance.  Seemed like launch was over-overwhelmingly full of edge lords rolling horde just because.
---
Dunno have you tried playing the game and no buying crap? Hell I even wasted money on enchanting and made none back. You playing vanilla and priv servers does not make you good, just means you played.
---
It's a 15 y/o game. I'd be very surprised if you couldn't get it to run, even on an absolute toaster.
---
paladins are in sore need of some love and attention - jack of all trades, master of fuck all right now.
---
You are right Sir. Still used to it tho ;P
---
That's because the rest of us are still playing. I'm sure it could happen to any server.
---
I had a Mage tag steal a mob from me (Hunter) and then run off to pull another, obviously thinking that I'd be forced to either kill it or run away until it dropped aggro and came back for him instead.
---
He must've forgot Hunters could FD?
---
So I FD and he's now got two mobs on him and dies. He then sends me /w abuse about managing my mobs. Apparently it was my responsibility to kill the mobs he tag steals from me.
---
The bar for healers is so fucking low because healers have spent decades in MMOs pretending that they're constantly victimized and blamed for everything for no reason. If you're a competitive DPS and switch to healer, you'll notice just how bad the average healer is.
---
Why not, to using Rockbiter? is there a better choice or best not to use Wep buffs?
---
No, you'll just miss the mace itself.  
---
I would say you have plenty of time to slowly complete the quest by level 25 or so, why give up so early on it?
---
I was soloing mythic on my paladin in BFA.
---
I was soloing +6 mythic on my warrior in legion.
---
I like this but wont upvote cuz you have 69 upvotes...Nice!
---
LF2M DPS ZG, link AOTC, recent credit report, and FedEx blood sample to address in description.
---
&gt; Why are Ret Paladins so bad at end game? Where is the evidence that proves these are not viable?
---
People who claim paladin dps is awful are exaggerating, you will do more than enough of the necessary dps to kill a boss. Paladins will however require effort which many people are not willing to do.

Arena and BG's are arguably horrible for the "world feel" and open world PvP of world of warcraft.  It takes a lot of potential out of the world by sucking players out of the world and rewarding instanced PvP with insane loot rewards while having no counter-balance for open world PvP.   I don't think they should come back in the same fashion that they were.  It should be more limited, or world PvP should get a buff/more incentives.  
---
Also, world pvp was gimped pretty hard too.  Dishonorable kills were implemented in such a way that it prevented any meaningful world PvP in or around towns, because no one wants to lose rank for getting a group DK.  Also, there are no real incentives to world pvp like there are instanced PvP, and that should change too.  Not only that, but "competitive" (or e-sport) style PvP eventually hurts the game as well.  It forces bad balance changes that eventually make the game shitty for the sake of the e-sport(arena) balance(Resilience was a big change that was generally bad, among others).     
---
The biggest reason why they even made instanced PvP in the first place was because of TM vs SS battles crashing every server all of the time, from what I remember.    
---
They could simply take the best content from TBC and tweak it for classic values. (Also before anyone screams nochanges this is \~2 years from now when all of the content is super dried out and you'll be begging for new content).  
---
   
---
They could also make awesome world PvP incentives as well, like capturable fortresses on each continent that have NPC/Player controlled defenses(catapults, etc) that when captured, you are able to "sign up" and invest say, 5 gold, and get a gold return based on how long your side defends the base.  They tried this with capturable towers in eastern plaguelands but they implemented that half-assed as well.  
---
Basically, shit's fucked and no one's really talking about it.
---
Mining engineering for sure, its expensive but its so worth it.. You will have an edge over anyone that doesnt have engineering
---
What a madlad
---
In russia, there is no 69 but 96
---
SS is the most damage per mana, if it goes full duration or almost full
---
&gt; It would be cool if my friends druid was a decent raid tank.
---
Druids are decent tanks though...
---
Why's it so dark. You're running a dungeon, not living in one.
---
No, I don't want transmogs in classic and a hairdresser will get us one step closer to the point adding exactly that :)

I tried doing Stockades, but the alliance just wouldn't let me in, any tips on doing it as Horde?
---
Otherwise up to date!

you answered, that's already more than I'd do :)

You should not ever be using Shadow Bolt outside of raids.

Thanks man! Just respecced into full shadow priest
---
only just replaced mine with a sweet Killmaim find ;)

Yeah Yojamba is complete aids for Alliance presently
---
He's mad because he doesn't have a mount and so can't beat OP in running to the nodes. It's apparently OP's fault that he's faster.
---
I have only ever felt this good about getting a mount 3 times in my years of playing wow.
---
The first time was my first mount in TBC which I received way later than Ivl 40 because I was new, no professions and learned all spells and what not..
---
The second time was when me and my guildies got the rusted proto drake in wrath.
---
The third time was when I dinged 40 a few days ago in classic and got my mount.
---
Damn it feels good.
---
 I am a mage, I didn't try that lol Didn't know that was possible, if it still is.
---

Ok here is a trick to change your name that works in retail. Or at least did like a year ago when i did it. Im not sure if it works or not so try at your own risk you have been warned. I guess it doesnt hurt to try it with level 1 characters to see if it works, but be warned again. If you do test this and it works you gotta wait 15 dayd to do it again so dont delete your main before those 15 days. So the way you could get free name changes was to just delete your character. Then you would create an alt with the same name that your main had (make sure to log in) and then you restored your main and since the name was already taken you got prompted to change it to something else
---
i dunno if i regret missing wow the first time but i'm having a great time. community is pretty great as well
---
I doubt you will find tos for this.
---
Indeed, I did Armory at 34.
---
At least they ran to the tank instead of into the next 4 packs... that's my luck.
---
I never heal a life tapping warlock.  That's their responsibility.
---
Well i don't like begger so it's ok from my point of view.
---
I mean cmon everyone has to farm for there own expenses why be a dick and begg others for it.
---
True. There was a big argument around the FFXIV community when their latest expansion was released. People started to play the game two weeks before release and expected to be up to date with the new content for early access. If they would have read up on the game before buying it (and later complaining) they would have knows that it is heavily story based and that you NEED to complete all story quests from 2 prior expansions to get access to the latest one. And of course it was not their own fault, that they didn't inform themselves before buying. /s
---
It depends on the players expectation and what they want to do in games, if they enjoy something or not. I don't understand people buying games that are obviously out of their comfort zone, only to start complaining about it. And it doesn't matter if it's a Dark Souls, that is all of the sudden too hard and needs an easy mode. A Final Fantasy, that completely unexpectedly has a story you need to play. Or WoW Classic, where you need to think for a second to figure out what to do next. I apologize for the sarcasm...
---
thank you!

You should have offered him to give you his clothes and then dance for you.

What’s a good build for somebody looking to pvp and dungeon (even if it’s healer)? I’m completely new to wow and a level 23 enhancement shaman so far. Watching guides hasn’t really stuck with me as how to level cause it seems based of respecing anyway once you hit 60. Just a little confused and don’t want to play inefficiently.
---
Rockbiter lets every attack cause additional threat, and the enemies will always (with very few exceptions) attack the one who has the highest threat. This should usually be the tank (usually a warrior or a druid in bear form). Flametongue or Windfury are the ones you want to use. Same for Earth Shock - only ever use Rank I in a dungeon, and only if you want to interrupt a spell.
---
This.  There are many ways around most issues.
---
Then why do CLEFThoofs have a roof?
---
WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS
---
I would like it if they added expansions like BC and WOTLK, but if they had a separate server group for them, while keeping vanilla servers the way they are. And they would let us move over characters (or at least one character) for free.
---
"god damn horde"
---
The last words those Horde heard before being engulfed in a whirlwind of pure steel and nutz.
---
Currently at level 32, playing with two friends on horde side. 
---
And honestlky I'm kinda lost as to where to go / what to do. 
---
We did most quests in hillsbrad, the quests we could do in STV and the ones in the Thousand Needles. As far as I know, we're kinda out of quests for our level. We've tried going to Desolace yesterday night but only a couple quests were yellow (despite requirement being like lvl 25-30 to accept those quests) and we quit the game out of boredom because our 2 hour play sessiion was more like a 2h session of walking simulator. 
---
Could you guys help us out ? Where should we take quests next ? Or should we just grind SM until level 35+ before going back to STV ? We had tons of fun in STV !
---
This definitelly used to work. I did it multiple times like a year ago. And you dodnt even need a friend, you could do it yourself. Characterd never get deleted 100%. You can always restore a deleted character unlike items which i think cant be recovered after 90 days
---
Follow up question, do you recommend me following a leveling guide for spells. my friends are telling me i should be focusing on only "important" spells, but being new i wouldnt really know.
---
My 12 year old is playing WoW, he's better than me and is further along.
---
Just let him play a warrior. It's not that bad and just because he hasn't played wow before doesn't mean that he's an imbecile.
---
Sounds pretty niche :/ but I feel your frustration
---
Same here played the beta sharing the account with 4 friends as teenagers, back now with the same friends but enjoying it fully and being able to pay that monthly fee by myself :)
---
Take your time, have fun. If you keep worrying about others you will burn out. I know how you feel. I worry about being left behind and then being behind for the raids. I told myself off the bat just to take it easy and go at my own pace.
---
Solo you have to single target pretty much, but duo leveling opens more options. I'm leveling with my Warlock friend 1-41 so far, and we usually kill 3 monsters at a time all the time, as we found that to be faster than killing them 1 by 1 or splitting up or whatever. How it works is I usually pull 3 monsters with Shadow Word: Pain and while they run to me the Warlock starts putting his 3 DoTs on every monster, I use Psychic Scream when I can hit all of them with it and we just wand them down. If they happen to pull more monsters we can take up to 6-7 at a time especially now that Warlock learned Howl of Terror but we have to drink after that.
---
I've also been trying to find a functioning addon for rare mobs (at least to show their locations on the map), but no luck :(
---
"PÅ BALKONGEN" lmao
---
I think he means "phase shift" which is an imp ability that makes the importance immune to damage so long as it's phased and not attacking.
---
Too bad blizzard won’t comment because they don’t want to give the guy attention. Doubt they’ll refund play time either.
---
In 15 years, I have never had an Alliance character above level 25, and the Night Elves are the single main reason why.  I've played on multiple PvP realms, and I have never encountered a more cruel or vindictive group of players in virtually any game.  It's very consistently Night Elves, as well.
---
I've noticed that every race in WoW tends to draw players with a specific type of psychology; and in the case of the Keldorei, it's the Paris Hilton demographic.  I'm not playing on a PvP server in classic, because I don't want that stress; but if I was, I admit that I'd probably still kill Night Elves on sight.

Wait til BRD.

I'm not trying to hype classic, just trying to understand why classic has this effect on me and retail lost it after mist of pandaria.
---
Those players levels are gray(10+ levels lower), you are not pvp sensation, you are mentally ill person
---
You\`re a shaman. You have ghostwolf form. You don't need that expensive mount at 40 as much as others do.
---
We've been lied to!

Are you on Noggenfogger?

“I make useless comments and don’t offer up an alternative scenario but still make fun of people who offer 2”
---
i was in a guild with someone that raided with that guy, sadly wasn't in the famous clip but said he was a walking rage machine in raids
---
If a renew is enough that's fine, but usually I end up having to do more than that
---
Yeah, that wasn’t changed until patch 3.1
---
I did not know it was working but I have had zero issues getting into dungeons as a dps. I don’t think enough people are using it to mess up the server community.

Yes I feel that, on ashkandi wool bags sell for 9s-10s but the wool cloth in the action house sells for 2s50c per 1

---
My god you're a fucking retard, I don't think even the BFA devs are this fucking clueless, you really take the cake.
---
Keep in mind that as Classic progresses and more raids are released, you'll have to spend more time raiding and farming consumables. MC/Ony will stay relevant until pretty much Naxxramas depending on your luck with drops. Same with BWL, ZG, AQ20 etc. So do yourself a favour and prepare for that now. Get your professions sorted, grind trade mats while they are cheap, maybe level an alt that can grind gold for your main.
---
Yeah I'm thinking I might just do some quests until lvl 42 and see how much gold I make in that time and if it's a bit low I'll try some sm cath or something. And no more frivolous spending ofc
---
Idk man, I'm a mage, I just did dj and questing, vendoring anything I didn't use.
---
The only thing I did was being very picky with the skill I bought (like no fire skill since lvl20 at least and only the most useful arcane ones like water and buff) and I had my mount just before I hit 41.
---
I don’t want to roll a warrior though, that’s the whole reason I’m asking this
---
I think that's elvui :)
---
Yeah was coming here to say its pretty easy to get there in BfA
---
&gt;Wouldn't hurt anything
---
Except suck every PvPer out of the world for weeks on end as they endlessly grind the arena instead of world PvPing because there's zero incentive to world PvP.
---
I actually like not have achievements.
---
If the achievement is there then I'll try to complete it.  If it isn't I'll just play the game.
---
The normal human body temperature in degrees Celsius is pretty sweet.
---
Who the fuck plays fury while leveling? lol
---
I played warrior and had my gold ready at 39.  
---
i exclusively levels in SM since 35/36 for the last bits of Gold and the XP ofc.  
---
overall tips to get your mount @ 40  
---
1. do not ever ever ever walk in the AH... just dont stay away from that place before 40  
---
2. pick up and loot all the crap and vendor it... litterly everything.  
---
3. pick a gathering profession and gather everything you see. (i did skinning and mining)  
---
4. dont buy all the spells at your class trainer.... look up which can be skipped.  
---
5. sometimes in between quest, grind for 30 to 60 minutes... just for the grind of xp and items and gold/silver.
---
Yeah they do fall off in pvp. But it’s not bad. Hunters don’t become a meme until everyone else is decked out in tier 3. Everything before that they’re just fine. Hunters are strongest right now when you’re aimed shot crits for 2k while casters have 2.5k hp.
---
Alright thanks! Means a lot
---
I'm not home for the weekend so luckily I can't play anyway, but I feel really for the hard working folks who can't play during the week and now couldn't even play on the weekend. That fucking sucks.
---
I have 28 Shaman and 22 Priest and I've been healing dungeons with both of them. At least so far it's not very interesting as the most mana-efficient way of healing is pretty much using that one heal skill all the time, other heals are pretty much for "oh shit" situations that will burn your mana really fast. For me it's pretty much trying to optimize my mana usage and throw in some DPS when I can. Even tho it's relatively simple I still enjoy holding the lives of my party members on my palm.
---
Both!
---
The humans of Hillsbrad fields have no skulls!  Trust me on this, I did extensive research.
---
Dungeons, whilst inferior for exp per hour are better than questing for gold/drops/cloth. Particularly if you do the dungeon quests.
---
If you have spare cloth, getting a tailor in your guild to make you bigger bags is a very good use for it as you can hold more trash to sell to vendors. Cloth isn’t selling well on the AH atm due to lack of gold in the economy and the surge of levelling players so bags is a perfectly sensible use for it.
---
Don’t buy skills you don’t need (this will save you A LOT) and don’t purchase any weapons or Armor. That’s a luxury that you can only afford when levelling an alt that’s bankrolled by your main.
---
If you need food, asking a mage in return for a small tip is cheaper than buying it from vendors.
---
Use your hearthstone intelligently to avoid long and expensive flights.
---
Skin everything and either vendor it or sell on the AH (but be careful to ensure the price on the AH can cover the AH’s cut and still make a profit above the vendor price).
---
Aside from that, just keep going about your business. I would discourage you from trying to gold farm before 60 as for each additional level you get, the amount of gold per hour you can make goes up so it is inefficient to grind gold pre-60.
---
This is a very naive understanding of DDoS.  The lead theory I've seen is that high profile attacks are largely conducted as a sort of advertisement for the botnet.  They're not going to just stop, and now when someone wants a DDoS they know to try to buy the people who effortlessly thwarted Blizzard.
---
Hey I see Miriah there, I got the name Mariah on Fairbanks for my only alliance character just Incase I get bored (huge Mariah fan tehee)
---
Back in Vanilla, there was a 19 Troll Rogue twink named Rowlf who used to terrorize us. It was like a universal "oh shit" moment when he was on the other side. He had everything BIS, and had the skill to back it up. When CRZ got introduced, I never saw him again.
---
Nice! I've been waiting for someone to claim the title.
---
Good thing hunter and shaman get to use scarlet set longer than warrior.
---
Probably a really stupid question, but I'm asking because I've found conflicting answers on Google. Can the Tauren ride anything other than Kodos, specifically wolves?
---
On one hand I have people saying that they can't because their models are too large, but on the other hand some say that they can as long as you get your Orgrimmar rep up. 
---
I'm a long way from 100G, but I'd like to prepare in advance, rep-wise, if I can in fact buy a wolf.
---
&gt; You're meant to adapt as a healer, not be useless and judgemental.
---
You are a pushover. Healers determine the pace and no one else.
---
It's not a speed up if everyone has to wait for the healer to drink twice more often.
---
We can pull mobs and keep doing dps while a DPS is drinking, on the other hand if the healer is oom you kinda have to pause
---
And that's without mentioning the risk of death from being mana starved in combat. If the fight turns dangerous, the mana you wasted healing a life tapper can easily be the difference that makes a group wipe
---
This is why alchemy helps pvp
---
Were you in a raid group?
---
Shamans who still use earth shock after getting frost shock outside of interrupts are the bane of my tank life :(
---
When you hit 60, or maybe sooner(?),  I guess you want to respec to healing if that is what you are going for.  How well can you do solo things when you are in this spec endgame? Because I don't see myself playing in group all the time. Also, I guess there are different bis for healing/shadow? How much are you switching around your specs in endgame? I heard shadow is good in pvp, but I also heard that respecing gets expensive.
---
Lots of questions all over the place, guess I'm just thinking aloud.
---
You should play The Witcher 3, basically every frame is screenshot worthy. Wow sure has some nice moments but is far from beautiful
---
The amount of CC mages have is insane tho.
---
You're delusional if you think the general playerbase is going to continue to play the same game for years on end without any meaningful content updates past naxx.  The normal player will not even make more than 1 character past 60, however they may experience every raid, and want more of them.
---
Yeaah.... you're going to use it soooo much. /s
---
"the most efficient profession"
---
Not if the evil bastards dont loot their kills...
---
You still need a wand for low lvls. And first two enchanter-made wands surpass everything else at that lvl
---
 by far.
---
The reward is winning maybe you should go back to bfa
---
There exists a setting in classic called need before greed that forces players to pass on drops they can't use or equip.
---
It's not fair at all because it lets warriors need roll everything (since they can wear cloth and wield staves) and clothies can't even greed roll things nobody want, such as green boe axes.
---
So it should never be used. I think group loot with common decency should be sufficient. :(
---
I was on vacation during launch so I started a few days late, and I'm playing on Shazzrah EU so the queues are insane, but I'm 31 at the moment.
---
Smooth criminal.
---
No issues, I use the add-on and lfg channels and people always look it both. The add-on just gives me a nice overview of the people looking for members.
---
Yeah, gold doesn't magically appear. He or someone else had to grind for the gold he owns. If I approached you when you're grinding gold for your 40/60 mount and begged for money, what would you do?
---
[That was me in 2006 or something.](https://i.imgur.com/uGGGZNK.jpg) I never bought anything, just random Drops.
---
He's not saying he doesn't DPS as healer in ff14, he's saying the DPS rotation for healers in ff14 is fucking mind numbingly boring.
---
And it is. It's a cool game though, but hopefully they give healers more fun damage, because spamming one spell while keeping a long dot up kills me.
---
i will alleviate, with a little masturbate
---
Still using this staff at lvl 41, at least i'm a mage though.
---
Try another server?
---
Takk not seeing manabars is the tank's fault. A tip for tanking is to turn "target of target" on. Then you tab through mobs and taunt the ones not on you.
---
lol took me a second
---
This is what a lot of people fail to understand. I'd rather have my 1g now than 10g down the line.
---
Ya I just focus on healing the tank, if a warlock want to tap then he can but they shouldn’t expect for me to heal them and I haven’t had one that got upset over it
---
If someone drops to 30% mid fight I'll generally need to heal them before something kills them.
---
Besides, I don't always know if damage comes from life tap or not, so if I see someone's health drop quickly I assume they're in danger and heal them. I don't necessarily have the time to check if they're life tapping or if they're being targeted by something.
---
If it's like one or two taps that slightly drop the health it's fine, a renew every now and then is enough. But I've seen warlocks doing wya worse than that
---
Something any character can do: fishing for oily blackmouth. They're used for potions that have legit use from the level where you're able to make them (about level 18-20 usually) up until the late game BG's, as they're in swiftness potions and waterbreathing potions (for vile reef quests).

Did you try going to Orgrimmar with your newfound freedom?
---
Slower weapons are not situational in fury.   You use whirlwind on cooldown still.   It is your best button other than execute.
---
I had a double kill too on my first rogue kill
---
It was a soulstoned warlock orc tho
---
My advice is to play class you think looks cool if you like class enough you are much more likely to be motivated to get good at it to learn how to play  dont worry about high skill ceiling
---
&gt; Title says it all. Probably party leader was a retail bot who has seen something on reddit once or twice about shamans being unable to tank.
---
Sadly, there's a large amount of people who have an outdated mindset of WoW and have only played 15 years ago. 
---
Shaman Tanking is very much a thing ESPECIALLY with how easy Classic is turning out to be. I have Shaman Tanked raids with relative ease on pserver I cant imagine how easy it's going to be in Classic. [here's a guide to help you](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150)

Thank you kind traveller, enjoice in your adventures

Have you tried deleting the cache folder ?
---
I mean I played pre-vanilla, all the way through TBC, and now classic, and I can for a fact 100% tell you that this game is nothing like vanilla.  Everyone knows everything now, the community at large is extremely different, and as fun as it has been I can definitely see the reason why Classic+ would be a good thing.  
---
Imagine having new content in classic that NO ONE can google and know everything about.  That's what we want.  That's a big reason why vanilla was so amazing in the first place, no one knew anything.
---
What about mining? I have no idea how much to sell things for, ranges way too much on the AH
---
I actually found a bow of searing arrows while role playing as shrek murdering wildlife in SoS as well. Another redditor found a SoJ there too. Me swamp is lit
---
True classic experience!
---
Pet should always have Growl and should always be passive, that way you offload 1-2 mobs from your tank and you full dps them without caring about aggro.
---
Just a tip from a pro hunter
---
how was the performance compared to retail?
---
Excuse my for being stupid, but what dropdown changes from classic to retail? When I click on Game Version is just sorts by retail and classic, but doesn't filter anything out.
---
as a shammy who just spent over 2g on a 2h axe and rockbiter buff to get that max dps... that last line hit home. i end up tanking most mobs and i know its not a healthy practice but i love seeing my big AA crits lol
---
&gt; Attack the same target as the tank.
---
Unless otherwise stated.
---
Guatafac sounds like an exotic pharmaceutical from the amazon.
---
More like "Learn to manage your mana so I don't get oom and the entire group risks wiping because I don't have enough mana to heal"
---
Seriously why do DPS think they're higher priority than healers? If you can't dps for a few seconds nothing bad happens. If I can't heal, people die.
---
Was standing outside ZF last night when the sandstorm rolled in damn I missed that.
---
I was born in 88. I do not know of other utilization of this.
---
I also want to know haha
---
um....both
---
True
---
What do you mean? You get revived on the boat. Obviously if you dont intend to swap continent releasing might be faster.
---
Yes when Phase 2 arrives it will bring the Dire Maul dungeons which are full of catchup gear. Later on you'll have ZG which also has catchup gear and lastly AQ20 and the updated dungeon loot.
---
Here's some advice, go kill a whelp of your choice and get a pet instantly.
---
A mage got a hunter only BOP item? Watafuk?
---
I heard they added BOP trading feature in dungeons to avoid unnecessary GM tickets, but it doesn't apply to raids does it?
---
You literally did nothing to get away... Didn't try to hamstring the wolf of priest, didn't fear, didn't stun...  You deserved to die 100% you just auto ran.
---
Also if you group up and aren't terrible you can kill skulls quite easily.
---
It varies heavily for me. Sometimes I see 20 horde standing outside ZF, killing any Alliance that inncoently would like to enter the dungeon. Other times I have 14 alliances swarming around me, making me scared of even tagging mob as to not anger them.
---
I would have him one copper and he probably got the thought xD
---
What level is it reasonably possible to maximize fishing and cooking?
---
He's got a point though. It's loot, and loot is rolled for.

its a word, look it up.

Get dunked on. You started fights with every person posting on this thread, then when youre proven wrong you shut up and leave... Typical
---
It's a sharp comment but so true, at least it was for me :D Only got my mount at 42.
---
&gt; I've found that I don't have the Retail's ability to add HoT icons 
---
Yes you do. They're in the addon's options.
---
That's a Twitter screenshot though
---
Leatrix plus let's you disable the buttons.
---
For legendaries, absolutely. 1-2 other key items, most likely. But if you are in blue prebis, theres still loads of upgrades you could get.
---
yeah, we had masterloot on epics, so everything else was kinda up for grabs, he auto looted the boss and for some reason hit accept on the warning it would bind him. We could trade BoP epics within 2 hours but not the green hunter skill...
---
*Feelsbadman*... 
---
I would give you a fist bump as a form of understanding, but I'm afraid I would rupture my 30yo spleen or something from the acute movement.  It really is a crazy scary realization.
---
The thing is that when you get to shatter the crits aren't lucky anymore but pretty reliable.
---
i will only kick someone if they are clearly being a troll, if someone messes up once or twice i will get on with it if they keep doing it i will make sure they know the tactics if after that they are messing they are more than likely a troll

Laughs in warlock/paladin
---
This is like a piece of art that should be immortalized by community to the end of time.
---
Honestly might do the same lol
---
I think in WoD they removed it completely, but people didn't like it. I assume it was in legion but I can't really remember tbh.
---
As you say, people still say weather was removed...
---
Change the thermal paste
---
Had a similar situation yesterday. I was running my way to Desolace, when I see two allies killing some boars or something. As I pass, I see them back off. Intentionally, I turn back, and help them kill off the extra mobs they pulled. I let out a /wave and I'm on my way.
---
On my way, I find a rogue, who says he's been ganked by two allies. I ask if these were the names and he says "yep". Immediately, I turn back, go to where I saw them and kill them off.
---
Now that's justice.
---
As a warrior, I'd be up for that.
---
Id check the server discords, thats where i would post info about a run, if i was making one. And obviously trade/LFG channel spam.
---
Kys
---
I think you guys are letting the dps off too easy. Ninja pulls and aggro stealing are party wipers.
---
Getting a group  together and spending 2 hours raiding the troll temples and completing all the elite quests, while coming across other adventuring groups, both Alliance and Horde, helping each other with the main bosses.... IT was SO GOOD, brought back a lot of memories from when I did those quests the first time.
---
This is what it's all about!
---
Y do ppl always say anything below 23 for sfk is too low lol. It's pretty normal to go in there as lvl 18-20
---
From a healers perspective that sounds more like you pull, your healer blows all their mana keeping the dps alive which creates more downtime.
---
Only pet I'd consider farming is a Disgusting Oozeling, they'll jump to like 500g once AQ drops
---
I'd say they not so much fall off, but more transition into another role. Early on you can play the hunter as a straight up dps class in BGs. Later on your role becomes guarding areas, kiting, peeling and such fun stuff while the hard nuke role is taken over by mages and especially warlocks.
---
As I explained to a rather boneheaded poster earlier, it can vary quite a lot according to the drops you get along the way. If you’re doing all the right things to maximise your income and minimise your expenditure, it’s just up to luck.
---
As a point of reference, I was getting about 5g from level 35 and it wasn’t quit enough. I think I would have got more farming SM but armoury is both boring and has no cloth drops and Cath only really becomes viable to farm at 38/39.
---
Dont ever walk in AH, except to buy bags :p
---
Have a wonderful journey in Classic!
---
The hunter did have a point, but he overreacted wayy to hard.
---
Really? You are comparing someone saying “we want the rights guaranteed by the constitution” is passive aggressive to you?
---
Their eyes glow green because of Fel
---
you keep saying this about comcast, however they use ipv6 now for network management and have supported ipv6 on all business accounts for awhile, and I have not found a home connection in years also that does not support it when the rest of the network also does.   VZ Fios on the other hand...
---
Im in guild with my rl friends .. I like Classic becouse of them.  We are talking on guild discord when playing. Do not want to leave even when we are more casual guild.
---
I'm new, what's the difference between tribal and elemental? Do you choose it at 150?
---
What are you even on about? The dungeons are so easy you don't need a real tank, just go in and dps the shit down. 
---
Are you people even playing the game?
---
Well, this reset ppl have weeks worth of prebis gear compared to first weeks clears. That was a different matter completely.
---
They should, but I think you underestimate the number of people who do not fully read tooltips. Some might also just forget about it or even underestimate its threat potential.
---
Cool story bro, keep out spouting rubbish without actually testing..
---
As I have already stated twice now, I have had **NO ISSUE** moving frames with MoveAnything. Any frames that don't were ones that didn't exist in vanilla wow in the first place(duh).
---
Again, stop spreading misinformation. I have literally posted proof of MoveAnything working on Classic live servers whereas all you've done is claim it doesn't work properly.
---
bro 😎💪
---
This is what i wanted to express with my first sentence.
---
They "catered to the masses" instead of "sticked to their agenda". Problem is: devs do not decide about target audience. The cash flow guys do.

Inshnu akkbar ?

You didn't get Verigan's Fist as a Pala? I used Verigan's fist for AGES in Vanilla.

But gold is literally greed.

That person is a scumbag.

I think the thing I like about retail most is the loot system.
---
feral is viable as a raid tank, except for some specific bosses. and you might have argue your way to some loot ^^
---
Paladin bad

We ran Karazhan every week for \~2 years and the Mongoose enchant never dropped once.

---
Yeah I’ve kinda noticed that too.  I’m sure some of the conventionally cited “annoyances” will get, well, more annoying over time, but I think I’m also just much more patient and mindful than I was when I was 14.
---
I thought I didn’t, but I did.
---
Real talk though, if you undercut overly aggressively you’re a piece of shit
---
I did, I'm still using it for lvling - I dont tank with a 2h :-)
---
WITH THE TASTE OF YOUR GUILD, IM ON A RIIIDE!
---
A lot of the time, most of the time, even 5 sunders is not sufficient to retain aggro on a single mob. Most blade flurry rogues still out-threat me even if they're attacking the adjacent mob. You really need to spec into prot if you want to have full aggro control in most fights.
---
That's why it's important for DPS, especially mages and rogues, *to watch their fucking aggro*, at least in dungeons above 40.
---
Gear can drop randomly from monsters, and you look up a few quests which gives you loot you need.
---
You can also AoE farm humanoids that drop cloth and make your gear from tailoring.
---
It can be viable, particularly with good spell cleave groups. The problem is that dungeon grinding is literally the most boring way to level. Once you’ve done the same dungeon 3-4 times, the risk becomes nearly zero and so it quickly becomes mind-numbing. At least with solo grind there’s a chance you die if you fuck-up.
---
If you can tolerate it though, go for it!
---
LeatrixPlus add-on has an option to disable screen effects, it might be what you're looking for.
---
Yeah this is a huge community breaking thing they did. When I first started playing WoW I'd meet someone on the same quest chain as me, or in a dungeon and add them to my friends list. Maybe we never group up again, or maybe we meet 4 hours later on another quest chain and the friendship grows. I met people through WoW that I've known for over 10 years, I really don't think those interactions are possible anymore and at best they are exceedingly rare.
---
There si one green 33 at start,rest are gray, 0 skills, 100 toxicity killing players who cant defend
---
This post just makes me glad they blocked linux users.
---
I'll add level filtering in one of the next updates
---
One of you should have emoted "#### feels their stomach drop as the molten mess seeps out between the mountain peaks." removed your legs and boots, then slowly walk of shame to the house.
---
I would create new chat tabs to seperate things and make it easier to follow.  I have created "Party" for party/whispers "Guild" for guild only chat and "World" for /world chat.  Keeps things in right place for me.
---
I did all wings once, except cath which I ended up doing 3 times because I wanted mograine's might.  I very much recommend doing them at least once, for the quests and any loot gear you can get, because it will really set you up moving forward.
---
I didn't spam any dungeons, and instead followed a questing guide.  It's honestly worked great, and my gold is really making it worth it.  Had mount at 40, and I'm on pace to have last bank slot bought with some savings at the end, and all training completed.  I can't imagine how you'd keep up on gold with dungeon spam.
---
Do not trust the witches in Dalaran!
---
sadly it was bound to happen at some point, in vanilla there wasn't anywhere near the level of knowledge or theory crafting that has gone on in the 14 years after  and because of that people understand the faster way to level, even if not the fun way.
---
I was in a SM GY/Lib run last night and a mage joined and just AoEs every pack and pulls more to make it worth while for him, it wasn't fun for me as a tank trying to hold aggro off a mage that is doing AoE from the moment you pull, dont care if it meant the run was faster i do the runs to enjoy the game
---
Honestly hunter players are the biggest of retards. I have experienced so many idiot hunters already it blows my mind.
---
Do you actually play so zoomed out? Impressive! What about when you go inside a building?
---
I somehow skipped SM grinding in vanilla (was a rogue though which is sub optimal for this) but I did grind the shit out of ZF
---
Thanks for the info, i'll fix that after work
---
Thanks, tbh i was looking at the clock under the map when I saw the no-Chestnutz
---
Herb/alchemy is pretty good, as health pots allow you to make more risky mob pulls.
---
Skin/LW is decent as well, for classes that can wear leather
---
If you are not working too hard on your leveling aka "speedleveling" I could recommend leveling up tailoring abit as you go. At level 37 there will be a set called "Shadow Weave set" which boosts your shadow damage aka your dots by a lot. Which definately helps you as you level up.
---
Here is the video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpGy5OUyfs
---
not sure i have a "healing aura" but crazies are drawn to me like flies to shit for some reason
---
Save it! Will be worth 200g once WSG releases.
---
Probably depends what level you are. At level 25 I found out that I could get by with rank 1 heal in most situations, rank 2 was overheal. Power word shield is really mana inefficient so I only use it in emergencies but renew is OK. I can get through most of a dungeon without drinking atm.
---
wtf people already at 60 and I just hit 20 yesterday, wish I could have no life too
---
/r/SweatyPalms
---
Well in fact you dont need a tank for dungeons At all until like brd or sth.
---
I tanked kath and razorfen as rogue witout any Problems as long as the tank doesnt wear cloth you will be fine
---
No, zero chance and we should be thankful. No changes.
---
Yes, that's an alliance only quest. Its closest horde sister looks to be this one: https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7850/dark-vessels
---
As a hunter, If a weapon gives +Attack power, will that affect my ranged attack power?
---
In reference to that, Is agility the absolute best stat for hunters to gain damage through using a bow/gun? Or is there a hidden mechanic like this attack power on items that may affect it.
---
Just because your idea of beauty isn't the same as arachnoids, there is no reason to get so mean
---
PvPits half the experience imo.
---
I'm levelling steadily right now and I'm running both mining and herbalism.
---
As you likely know I can't have both track herbs and minerals at the same time. Area there any good work around to this? Any add-ons that can show both? 
---
I created a macro that will switch between the two, I wanted to bind it to the jump key but I learned you can't put jump into a macro :(
---
So if there's no good solution I'll drop one of them for blacksmithing or alchemy. Any strong opinions which is best for a warrior?  Blacksmithing seems the obvious choice but I remember it being a bit underwhelming in vanilla, but that was a long time ago..
---
Do you have a fucking death wish
---
Ah the good old days, guild vs guilds battle and their high latency due to the amount of lag generated by all thoose people going after one another.
---
We actually made our server crash on a massive PVP battle in front of orgrimmar, wasn't guild vs guild, was just plain horde vs alliance.
---
Fun times.
---
I managed to kill my character with life tap, forgot I just upgraded it. Warlock life is not for me, it seems.
---
Mate...this is 100% swapped the actual video is by  Pursuit of Wonder
---
32 on my server, many are rushing and aoe farming SM but i just dont see the point of rushing, i played 60 in vanilla for a long time and i will get there in classic to relive the joy of downing Raggy for the first time on the character as well as going through ZG one of my all time best raids, love the troll content. but i will do it when i am ready to do it not because i rushed to be max level as fast as i could
---
wow that is actually so tempting :D
---
I personally like to blink in and help out the best I can with my awesome CC and then murder them in cold blood as they feel secure with me nearby now. No regrets, I didn’t pick a pvp server to be a pacifist.
---
I'm not really sure what's the from memory part of this.
---
As a lock im never above 50% hp while questing or doing dungeons. 
---
Just dont heal them all the time. Its better they lifetab and do lots of damage then that they sit around eating and drinking all the time. 
---
When my health and mana are low enough ill take a  food and drink break. 
---
Personaly ive notished a lot of healers that want to top off the health of all players and they get anoyed by lifetap.
---
Just heal them when they get attacked by a mob and dont heal them when they lifetap. Count on the lock knowing when its best to do it and when not to.
---
How can you even know that? Sounds like bullshit to me. Plenty of servers are being affected.
---
Gotta give it props to him being called Vicky Pollard, anyone who doesn’t know who that is should google it :D
---
I'm sorry if you felt this was cherry picked dude. Just a reflection at the moment of how I feel my experiences have been with both.
---
I missed the faster pace and instant gratification of retail, so I thought I'd jump on for 40min. That was honestly my experience.
---
Sweet job!
---
I play on Razorgore Alliance too.
---
There are a few items that use leather but not many.
---
I've also been a shaman main literally since vanilla, so it's information I may be taking for granted.
---
I did not heed the warning and named my gnome Cogsock because he hides cogs in his socks. I'll see you guys online!
---
Sucked at healing?
---
PvP because PvE is half the experience?
---
I rolled this as paladin in Vanilla and some asshole mage posted in the fucking guild forums about it, that’s how mad he was.
---
thank you very much for the super fast response :) thanks alot i will get mine there. dunno why all the Content creater did the wrong Research?!
---
Like you said, players are considered to have max weapon skill in pvp and that’s why I’m saying human racial affects pve. 
---
That’s why you see humans using daggers in pvp, orcs using swords etc

So, talking out of your butt is ok then?  Got it.
---
There's a lot of stuff that it does - [Leatrix Plus](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus).
---
Some of the stuff I am using:
---
\- hide gryphons around the action bar (minor thing, but I like it more)
---
\- automatically cancel /sit or dismount when you want to cast spell or something
---
\- auto vendor grays
---
\- auto repair
---
\- show class color in chat
---
\- hide damage/healing numbers from UI frames
---
\- hide most error messages (not enough rage etc.)
---
\- move/rescale player/target frames
---
\- show Wowhead link to a selected quest above quest log (if you're stuck for example)
---
\- hide stance bar
---
\- allow larger unzoom distance
---
There's also Leatrix Maps (Classic), which turns your map from fullscreen to a windowed one (like in retail). It allows zooming and also adds dungeon locations (not sure if this can be toggled on/off).

STVietnam is the place to be. Just stay out of Hillsbrad Foothills for now, thanks.

As another Linux user and someone involved in many Linux communitites, I can say that the person you're replying to is not representative of the general Linux userbase. Most of us are just regular people who just want full control over our own computers. They're a remnant of the old days, back when Linux really was actively under attack by various corporations. Best ignore them, really.

&gt; because an rp spec and a prot paladin spec are on an equal level of the uselessness slope
---
Wrong. 
---
&gt; every spec to be equally valued
---
Not what I said.
---
enic
---
Ahh gotcha
---
i know you hear a lot of mage aoe leveling like its some ezmode free pass, but thats only on private servers with low population. its way easier to just level like any other class on classic.
---
Just another example of how blizzard took identity out of the game.
---
To enable everyone to play the newest expansion (and, well, buy it...) they introduced fast leveling and what not. But what maybe was meant for the 6th twink also killed the entire growing up of new players. 
---
Hell. We were able to SOLO mc and so much more after dinging some new endlevel. Disgusting.
---
Fack... I had a feeling this would be it. Me and my mates have spent time getting to level 20 on the PvE 😭😭
---
It depends on what you want to do really. If you want to do as much damage as possible or do pvp as good as possible tjen engineering is a must have.
---
A lot of mining/herbing plus layering to reset nodes
---
&gt; as resisting my taunts 
---
You dont have taunts as an shaman.  
---
Main reason why people dont want a sham tank.  
---
But if you do the dungeons when you are high enough, like you said lvl 19 for WC, you should be able to tank fine.  
---
But below you are in for a tough job.
---
t.b.h. i dont want a sham tank :) - but thats because im a warrior tank :D
---
Then you should not heal the lock so much.
---
That's exactly why I play an honourable Undead acupuncturist. I believe in fair play, and will offer free samples of my services. Works best on cloth wearers whilst drinking.

Does it really look like this at night ?
---
I'm surprised they locked the command entirely instead of just reducing the range to 35ish yards. I totally understand (and agree) that the modern ranges do not belong, but I never imagined the max would be so small. It makes nameplates literally useless.
---
Oh, it was meant without sarcasm actually - thought you were upset with your hairdo. Words of comfort, or an attempt at it :)
---
Correct
---
I still have my atlas and original strategy guides too. Glad I kept them.
---
I always recommend people to play on PvP servers. They give people to choice to participate in World PvP if they want to. But most of the time alliance and horde meet, no fight happens. But the crucial part is the players are given a choice, and thus you get player interaction, even if no fight happens.
---
Maybe you just get creative in this game. Farming, gathering, selling drops. Man, you can even play the auction house itself.
---
I cannot stop feeling that these kind of DDoS attacks on paid online subscription services are pretty much the same as stealing. I don't know about you guys, but I scheduled time this weekend to play, and couldn't because some douchebag intentionally brought the service down. I mean, we are paying for this, I hope they can find and criminally charge whoever is responsible.
---
as a healer i gotta say, stop crying. dungeons aint that hard. tanks are literally pointless in this game outside of big pulling. im a big fan of the old 'if you pull threat you tank it' rule, so when i vamp embrace the boss in shadowform and mind blast them down and the tank literally cannot peel, its not only fucking fine but also expected. The only difference between classic and retail for dungeons is that i have to drink more often. you can still monster pull entire rooms at a time and be fine. 1 heal with my +76 to healing spells will top you right off. I haven't done a dungeon where a mage, or myself (priest) doesnt pull threat. chuck a bubble on them and they'll live.
---
The real skill is just having a priest at the bottom to revive you when you crater.
---
It's the sad truth sometimes, the very thing that made WoW stand out back then is what is lost in the current retail version. That's one of the biggest draws to Classic, least to me. I loved how things were rough and rage inducing sometimes. Had to bounce around zones just for questing to level. I'm one that didn't care for the dungeon scene, but tried to find groups to do some of the elite quests. Even helped with a pair that was doing a quest that I wasn't on the same part of the chain. Didn't matter, it was a good reason to get some extra exp. 
---
You had to build those groups, had to form the network of communication to get shit done in Classic/Vanilla. In retail those days were replaced with dungeon finder and raid finder tools. Granted, if I look I'm sure I can find an addon that least tells others with that addon that I'm looking for this dungeon, but I'm over here so I'm not sitting around town all damn day. Noticed the other day that someone mentioned a person ninja looting, I kid you not least 6 people all said that they were adding that name to a blacklist. One said they removed that player from the guild they were in. So the community at large is a very powerful resource, screw up in Classic and there's no second chances. 
---
I blame certain streamers that just did SM AoE farming. That was never a thing back in Vanilla. Crowd Control is absolutely vital in ZF, so many mobs close together and the patrolling packs are deadly if you pull at the wrong moment. No worse feeling than seeing that 1% HP mob run right towards a group with a patrol and the healer has nearly no mana.
---
20 comes really quickly, especially with friends. Go for it!
---
Actually, they account for 0.0% of the supported playerbase for blizzard. If they put measures in that impact linux users they go 'wait.. we don't have a linux client'.
---
IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO  CALLS THEM BUBBLES!!!

this is not low quality.

There is no quelity to be found in this picture..... wtf
---
Yesterday I healed BFD. I had rank 2 and rank 1 heal. I only used rank 2 heal a handful of times as it was generally overheal.
---
Yes. They aren't going to just lead the raid for free. It's a lot of work, that's why people are willing to join raids with reserved items instead of just starting their own raid. Reserved items are their payment. I have no problem with people that put in more work receiving more of a reward.
---
Needing on boe was the standard rule even back in vanilla, atleast the server I played on. There are very very few items that are boe and BIS for a very long time. One of the few I can think about is edgemaster's handguards which is a 500g+ item, maybe even 800+. If there are 1000 ways to farm gold for me, that means there are 1000 ways to farm gold for that warrior that needs those gloves aswell. No way I would pass on an item that could buy me an epic mount.
---
If i have rolling hots on me, i will make use of it and life tap plenty and often, so keeping up a single renew on them will allow for them to use more spells and deal more damage. By level 30 most warlocks are levelling by "drain tanking", so we have improved drain life and make use of that when tapping. Between pulls, i will tap to full and bandage / eat. Just be aware that most locks will only tap when they are able to recover the health themselves. If you tell a warlock that you wont be healing them to full when they tap, its always understood. Its our job to manage mana and health.

---
Every. Fucking. Group.
---
Yes it is, the biggest time difference on the planet is 26 hours, i made that comment deep into sunday, wich means most of the countries are LITERALLY in sunday already, so thats EXACTLY how it works lol, what do you think exactly? That there is DAYS of time differences? LOOOOOL
---
Could be wrong here, but what you heard most likely only applies to retail, not to classic
---
Same here . I had a couple free days and leveled up but now I gotta go back to playing twice a week. Can’t wait to be 30 by December !
---
There is much to be said for the improvements that have been made in recent years, especially on the armor and weapons front. This was one of the major factors that kept me from Classic.
---
After running around in gorgeous Alliance battlefront plate, with it’s fine details, and realistic look, I doubt I could get excited for the old Tier 1 sets again, with it’s primary colors and KISS Army shoulder pads.
---
😄
---
Great, cheers for the explanation. Sounds like I can stick to mouseovers then, and trying to keep my bars tidy with mod: lines.
---
What does up to 40 mean? Is the number rng?
---
But numbers are above letters on the keyboard?!
---
Convenience promotes antisocial behaviour in all walks of life. Doesn’t surprise me to be reminded that the same is true in WoW.
---
Quit crying everyone can't play r just Linux can't play and everyone else can. If not for this you wouldn't be playing anyway.

If I put up VE and cast mind blast it will take the tank 30 seconds to pull aggro off of me :D
---
This kinda story makes me a happy face and one huge reason why playing again the same content after 13 years.
---
You should join on his RP, it would make a cool noir story. If you are on rp realm that is
---
Is it actually restricted access or could you sneak in there with the help of a raid group?
---
The hunter was TECHNICALLY in the right about the chest. His attitude was pretty bad though. Then the ninja loot puts him into the jerk category. 
---
The rogue having dibs since he can open it is one of those grey areas that depends on the group involved. Was running stocks last night on my pally. We rolled for both locked chests and I opened them for the winner both times. Blacksmiths have just as much ability to open locks if they level it. We get keys made out of the precious metals that open them at different levels. Having a high level BS with keys can save a dungeon run when it comes to max loot due to some rogues forgetting to level their lock picking skills. 
---
By that rogues logic. I could have claimed both chests since I was the only one who could open them. But like others said. I am providing a service to the rest of the party just like my aura and blessings. Doesn’t entitle me to extra loot or anything. Since my keys are not technically free. I may be able to claim a small fee to recoup the cost (4 s for one silver key on my server). Rogue has no need for that.

---
Yep, OSRS are the blueprints to follow
---
As a healer, I either like you (because healing you actually takes some effort) or hate you (if you suck at this strat). YMMV.
---
TheI love that I can finally get shit done irl when playing classic. I'd do house chores while waiting on a zeppelin, flight path, or just have someone on follow. In retail you just hearth to the major city with one of your 4 hearthstone that has a 15min CD and take a portal to a major city.
---
started at launch time.  
---
dinged 44 yesterday evening..  
---
Now holiday is over and back to work :D
---
I wore a shining silver breastplate a further advanced guildie made for me from 24 till 52, when I got Deathdealer in BRD (which is pretty much 2nd best dps chest behind savage glad).
---
Why would you want to? It's a terrible dungeon since it has next to do drops; alliance only really do it for the quests (or to cleave I guess)
---
&gt; No, I can't Heroic Leap, Thunderclap, Shockwave a pack of trash mobs while everything is on a 5, 10 or 1 minute cooldown, all while being rage starved. 
---
And here I am on my paladin tank listening to scrubs tell me that "paladin can't tank, only warrior good tank". pffft
---
Around 30 is super casual now.
---
Neither of these are working, i used "will it classic" and they aren't even showing up in the addons menu :/
---
"since some of us are on the spectrum" LOL. if you were black would you use the same excuse for guild name "Ni\*\*\*\* Guild"
---
Sadly literally censoring everything because of the special snowflakes is an everyday thing and a priority at that :(.
---
Manage your mana means lifetap as much as needed.
---
ffs i can't even imagine being able to do that, i'd be in floods of tears.  i'm legit terrified of my parents dying because i don't know how i'm gonna deal with it, being emotionally repressed all my life!
---
Just don't go on a server where your side is the underdog, then pvp realms are fine
---
I prefer pve realms, because I have very limited time during the week. If servertransfers get possible, I go to a pvp realm in phase 3 (if pvp &lt;-&gt; pve will ever be possible)
---
My picture proves that it works in Classic. What more proof do you need? I really couldn't give a flying fuck what randoms or developers say when I am using it in a live client with no issues whatsoever. I don't know why you're so hellbent on trying to convince everyone it doesn't work. You have issues being proven wrong or something?
---
traps in wow now
---
I got my dog 2 years before wow vanilla even came out and he's still alive, just about
---
There's no such thing as too late. Gear slows down exponentially at higher levels. If you get lucky you could easily catch up to people who reached 60 weeks before you.
---
Maybe I've just been lucky but I'm having an easier time with Enchanting than I am with Tailoring.
---
The only problem is.. enchanting is a huge gold sink because you're disenchanting greens instead of selling them.
---
Then use them and don't stay at 30% health in a dungeon where a single agro would kill you?
---
Grats to oyu, I'm sitting at 210 at the moment, by far the weakest profession I have, but guild leader put first raid on Sunday, so I have to prioritize leveling more. :(
---
*Baitsa Dasuto*
---
Spare a penny kind sir!
---
No real reason, just to say I did!
---
Until mortal strike it’s probably better than arms, 2h fury builds aren’t uncommon and you can still tank dungeons
---
Level 39 I have 18g
---
Some servers have a high community of a certain country. If you want to play with others from same country you can look for it only which server has most.
---
The difference is that certain BoE epics sell for several hundreds, in some cases almost a thousand gold. The odds of a rogue actually equipping a Krol Blade that drops are nearly zero, everyone except ridiculously rich players are going to sell it. The only difference in practice is whether you're going to allow one or five people to roll for gold.
---
what are you going to do with the 30 seconds saved?
---
Tribal LW - Monitoring devilsaur market and sellin off the gauntlets/legs as combos to richer people basically.
---
If you have a nice slow weapon whirlwind does more damage than bloodthirst will and should be your main spam button.
---
First time I played WoW as an orc warrior in the early 2000s, Ashenvale was a godsend. I had been through all the desolate lands that are between the valley of trials and late Barrens, and suddenly I enter this lustrous forest with elvish chants playing in my ears. It was enchanting. I had no idea such a magical region existed in the game. I decided there and then it was my favourite place. My orc warrior would defend it against the alliance with his very life. It was before the implementation of BGs and such. PVP was spontaneous and I sucked at it. Yet I joined every battle I could, and tried to move unseen in the forest and gank every enemy I could surprise, for my beloved Ashenvale.
---
Later on I discovered the logging camp, and how the Horde were trying in-lore to raze Ashenvale.
---
Even later on, I rerolled a NE druid. Oh boy was I surprised by the whole Darnassus region.
---
Your body is tied to the boat. Regardless of which continent you spawn back at, you're going to have to run to the boat.
---
warum fragst du nicht einfach im /1 nach ner witchhunt anstatt hier?
---
i killed a murloc in west fall and someone whispered me and said it’s common courtesy to not tag a mob if you see someone else targeting it asshole!! then ignored me. brah how am i supposed to see who you’re targeting. who tf are you
---
Purely in my opinion one of the major issues with classic is that that gear difference everything else to AQ40 and from AQ40 to Nax is probably a bigger leap than any other point in wow. 
---
I think one of the major missing elements in classic is a 20 man raid on a similar difficulty scale to AQ40 that would help to bridge the gap between the last few bosses in AQ40 and the first few bosses in Nax. This 20 man should have been released well after Nax to give the hardcore player base the opportunity to clear it without and release to help the average player bridge this gap. 
---
If you think about it ZG and AQ20 did this for their respective dungeon tiers but blizzard moved on with tbc instead.
---
This item would be an upgrade for my rogue. Should I roll on it for fun?
---
you can take em out for everything else too. Without the specified rank it will always take the highest one
---
It might be the people a little, but the way the world and game is structured to strongly encourage meaningful player communication also plays a large part. At the very least I hope the positive attitudes rub off on the new people before the old people's rose tinted glasses wear off
---
Thank you very much for this.
---
I know to the far right near a small house I was able to.
---
What the fuck, clicked on your picture and saw "iddqd"
---
Love your streams dude :)
---
Gratz on the mount

Imagine not just working out at home
---
I'm following this mostly so maybe it'll help https://vanilla-questing.me
---
I didn't say one area wtf are you even talking about weirdo?
---
I'm on a TBC private server and I have to say the community there is much better than what I have experienced on my classic server so far.
---
Wait what? Is he? and how does this play out on the server?
---
Life Tap: For those times your healer has more mana than yourself.
---
Yep, I've just stopped healing them. As a drood I have a low rank rejuve I pop on them during a potential AOE threat fight but that's it.
---
How do you have the folders in the AddOns folder? It should be like AddOns&gt;*the addon you want*&gt;addon files
---
If it's like AddOns&gt;*the addon you want*&gt;another folder&gt;addon files, then the game won't recognize them.
---
Yup this. I typically try to tell the healer to not make me a priority. I have enough survival tools that I can usually heal myself if needed
---
Uuh.. warlocks life tap so they can drain back the HP and DPS.
---
The only time you heal a warlock is if they are low on HP *and* mana. If they have one or the other they’re generally good.
---
This is more of a complaint from a bad healer who don’t understand warlocks.
---
\*Roundabout starts playing
---
***To Be Continued***
---
wieso witchhunt, ich hoffe du konntest die Ironie rauslesen
---
ich hatte schon lang nicht mehr so viel spaß wie gestern :D
---
Das me! Thanks man, and thanks again!
---
Imagine getting custom shirts made with a shitty meme on them and being proud enough of them to post it on the internet for meaningless points.
---
225+.
---
IIRC elemental is more Rogue oriented and tribal more druid-y. Wowhead had some guides I believe.
---
I'm a warlock whos reasonably trigger happy with life tap. I have other means to get my health back. E.g life drain which also increases my chance of shadowtrance.
---
Because of this I dont expect to be healed by the priest when life tapping. Unless I have pulled mobs from the tank which I tend not to do I should be fine.
---
Don't heal them and if they get shitty tell them its something they have to manage themselves when they make the decision to be life tap heavy.
---
Ooc I lifetap then engage in some wholesome cannibalism to get my health back.
---
Did the same, about 20g/hour
---
What in the name of Christ am I looking at
---
Achievements ruined the game, especially aotc

Epic mount after 2 weeks is quite an achievement. Now what? :D I have similar goals. But level 41 atm and just bought first mount with help of a friend. My final goal is Kel´thuzad tho.
---
I suppose you are referring to missing Power Word: Shield buff. I simply added the missing aura applied by PW:S in the list of "tracked" buff (in this case is #69).  
---
If you are wandering how I got that number: go to classicdb or wowhead and search for PW:S, look at the effects this spell produces and you will read something like this ( Effect #1(6) Apply Aura #69 ), bingo.
---
Clean
---
You don’t seem to understand how warlocks work.  They have talents that make them have significantly more stamina than a typical cloth wearer.  They also have several spells that fill their health back up in combat.  You’re literally wasting mana healing them between pulls, they’ll be fine.
---
ore is usually more valuable than the vendor prices.
---
The thing to check here is if it is worth more as ore (because people can level up mining by smelting it) or as bars (because people buy it that don't mine themselves for example).
---
get an AH addon asap to get a good overview of the prices.
---
I would for sure wait. Prices will steadily rise as time progress. Not talking about having to wait like half a year or something. You could probably get a very good price in 4-5 weeks or so.
---
Could give a tip as well related to this topic. If you want to get stuff like recipes for example. Now is the time to buy them in the AH. For example bought Savory Deviate Delight recipe for 2,5 g a week ago, cost 8-9 g now on my server and will cost even more soon. Bought elixir of the mongoose for 3 g, up to 5-6 g five days later. A recipe that I sold for around 30 g on a private server that wasn't that old.
---
Basically you will save a lot of money in the long run buying stuff now. Anyone playing warlock/paladin have a huge advantage in this regard as well since no need to have the money for 40 mount.
---
The economic aspect of WoW can be really fun. Spend a lot of time as a result on my bank alt. You can earn a lot of gold doing so little work.
---
Worked fine for me, thanks!
---
Ret is the best leveling build for pallys. Holy is the ‘best’ endgame build for them. Pallys are middle of the road both as tanks and DPS. Depending on the guild you join. Some will care. Some won’t.
---
Either way. Expect your main role in endgame content to be buffing, healing, and cleansing. Paladins are the most efficient healers in the game. You should be running at the bottom of the overhealing  meters for most groups. 
---
Side not. Ret pallys are actually pretty good in late game pvp.
---
Most sensible warlocks do. But health &amp; mana are interchangeable for us, so don't stress so much about it
---
The amount of close calls I had with that elevator back in the day is way too many to count.
---
Why not use WASD? Way beter placement to be using 1 to 5 keys, which you can combine with shift 1 through 5, and even alt 1 through 5, and the latter is perfect die your shape-shifting in my opinion. Also use G, F, T etc, and ofcourse combined with shift. You'll have enough keybinds that way. Really no need for a mmo mouse.
---
Nah I get it totally. I like to help people ingame but I draw the line at outright begging! They need to be appreciative and nice is all I ask for.
---
My first week in classic I was a NE hunter happily offering help, crafted items and drops all throughout my time up in Darkshore &amp; Ashenvale. I didn't mind giving away crafted leather armor and item drops for free because people thanked me! It helped build a community atmosphere in Auberdine, where I spent quite a few hours just chatting whilst making stuff for people. Grateful people who in turn would help others too! It just felt great being in a thriving and helpful environment. I've not felt that in YEARS! And I've played a lot of MMORPGs in the last decade. Practically all the big games. The last time I felt like I was playing in a happy helpful community was City of Heroes.
---
Fast forward to a few days later, I'm in Goldshire on my second toon. A twink I suppose you could say, as shes decked out in a lot of nice stuff my NE saved. I'm just standing in Goldshire chatting, offering guidance. Anyone who thanks me and is nice gets a discreet trade window full of armor packs/food &amp; drink etc just for being nice. Then along comes a grumpy mage who's been whining in the channel about how lame classic is. How they cant afford a decent a weapon etc. I see them saunter past me near the inn just as I'm trading with another player who is thanking me for the free stuff. This obviously got their attention, and you guessed it...
---
"u giving free stuff help I a poor"
---
I open a trade and put in 5 water, 5 food and 10 silver. A nice freebie that I give to under level 10's I think. It's not like you need a lot of money in your first few hours... right?  Everyone thus far had appreciated it. But not this guy. 
---
"is that it. I am pooooor"
---
"And that's plenty for you until you get to Westfall" I reply.
---
"YOU SUCK! why you not help me like that other dude"
---
And with that I /shrug, go to log out. And just as I'm camping I  reply "Because you are rude and begging!"
---
Funnily enough they had enough money to send me a snotty mail later on! 🤣 I wish I had screenshot it now, as it just made my day even better and I should have shared it. 
---
The moral of my long-winded story? Don't be a dick and that priest in Goldshire called Mércý might be nice to you next time! 😜
---
only thing that can happen is that they ruin classic if they update its activison there arent a single game that they own that doesnt suck and srent a pay to win game probably soon classic will also get ingame shop and pay to win
---
I wish we could go back to the times where you could be as toxic as you wanted and people would just get over it and move on. Those were the good times lol.
---
Holy crap, that's impressive! I can barely afford my reg mount D: So cool!
---
Asmongold? More like ass man bald. Heahueheaheu
---
Best bet is to get naked and just do it by inches while spirit running, then
---
&gt;That, form your own group, do LFM tank heal dps - normal run and you should be fine.
---
But you can always talk about it loot-wise. Hunters won't take priority on melee weapons, while others won't have his bows and guns or such.
---
I am a mage. Guys, if you are questing with a mage, we need mana breaks! Yesterday I was out of mana and I told the group we have to stop for me to drink. A hunter told me to use my stick (my stick!) and pulled more mobs immediately. I was so angry.
---
^^^^
---
And even after telling them to slow down and to let you pull, they dont listen. So I literally have to race to the next pack otherwise some dumb ass mage is gonna pull
---
&gt; Best Priest race is Dwarf because you get Fear Ward. 
---
I disagree. Yes Fear Ward is great vs some fights, but the +5% spirit is literally always useful.
---
Pvp realms offer an experience pve cant. Sometimes these experiences are the difference between playing 2 months and played 2 years.
---
And last week someone told me Molten Core was definitely still difficult and the only reason APES cleared it was because they’ve done it hundreds of times and are very skilled and dedicated. 
---
I don’t deny the last statement, but let’s be real MC I still super fucking easy. Likely the easiest raid in the history of the game, he even said Garr will break guilds... fucking Garr?? How god damn delusional can you be?
---
It's _classic_&gt;Interface&gt;AddOns&gt;Immersion, Bagnon, Leatrix_Maps, BetterVendorPrice (tried vendor price base as well), and they're all folders.
---
a small price to pay for
---
Played FF14 for some time, too. Recently, I pretty much stopped at the 100 bonus quests after ARR because damn is it boring. For some reason, i never found FF14 to be immersive as a world. Usually just walking along the fixed story quest, which, for some reason annoys me. I never feel like i can just wander and enjoy the world, because the Storyquest tells me what i need to do to have any kind of progress(because locking an MMO world behind a fixed storyline didn't work for me as a concept).  
---
People constantly tell me, it gets better with the first expansion(which i own, too) but i can't get around to do it. If it wasn't for the guild i'm in, i'd most certanly  stopped way earlier (cool people, and we meet once a year).
---
I mean yeah, anybody can be a dickhead, but i personally never took a dagger with agility away from a rogue who needed it
---
just don't ... or they will never learn
---
I try to be nice to the Alliance on my server. 
---
Came across a dwarf rogue the other day drinking and eating. Dude was pretty beat up after fighting some Furbolgs, probably at 20% health. I’m a warlock one level ahead of the guy, fresh in terms of resources. It would have taken very little to DoT the guy and kill him, be done with it. But I /wave and let him go.
---
The VERY next furbolg I pull to kill, the rogue I just spared opens on me and kills me. 
---
I’m sure there are great, friendly people on the alliance side of the server. But I’m killing you all on sight when I have the chance now. Not even a little bit personal, I’ve just tried to love and ended up losing y’all.
---
PvP is always my go to.
---
Yes you'll rage more but it's far more authentic of a WoW experience. Getting ganked sometimes happens to everyone. There is nothing like the feeling of someone trying to kill you but you outplay them.
---
&gt;So the point of my post is to all my alliance fellow friends on Lucifron, if you find him kill him make a picture on his corps while dancing and share the nice little picture with all of us in the comments
---
... zu behaupten das ja alles nur ironisch gemeint ist, ist ziemlich dämlich
---
You should play a healer man :)
---
It looks fine, and I suggest intensity &gt; imp searing pain, cuz you get to aoe farm better with intensity, altho imp searing pain would probably be better for pvp
---
sounds extremely exhausting
---
You must be fun at parties
---
this is a joke right?
---
No human in the raid :(
---
I love how you managed to get a few of them to move with that final one even though the boss was already dead
---
Even more unless to give them detect invis because wtf does it actually detect...?

#  &lt;Peaky Grinders&gt; | Mograine | Horde | Casual /Semi-Hardcore
---
Hello everyone!
---
The **Peaky Grinders** is a levelling guild on EU - Mograine that is open to friendly players who are casual or semi-hardcore.
---
**Who are we?**
---
The Guild was founded by a few real life friends who are around their thirties who used to hardcore Vanilla WoW when they were students and want to relive the nostalgia. We now have a healthy mix of members who came from retail, pserver veterans and older players who came back after a (long) hiatus to play Classic (and a few newbies!). 
---
We have opened some officer spots as well who are ready to be filled in by people who actively engage in the guild.
---
We now have over 100 members with a steady active core of about 40-50 people, growing each day. Guild chat is active and always willing to help out with your questions and we also setup a discord with two voice channels for guild dungeon runs (don’t worry you’re not obligated to join the discord). Guild Tabard is live too!
---
**For who?**
---
The Peaky Grinders tries to target players who also have to combine WoW with work, marriage, kids and/or social life. Active hours are therefore 5 - 11 PM CET on weekdays and pretty much the whole day during weekends.
---
All levels are welcome but it’s a good thing to know that most of our players are now in the lvl 25-50 bracket.
---
All classes and specs can join! Play what you want as long as you’re willing to improve and are open to advice from the experienced players.
---
**What do we do?**
---
We focus on running dungeons together the most. Yesterday we grinded the hell out of Zull'Farak with the guild but you'll also find daily SM and Uldaman runs. As the lvls will increase we will also be looking out for more wpvp events.
---
**What about raids?**
---
The Guild Council is definitely planning to raid but we probably won't have standard times and will most likely check availabilities of the guild members to decide times on a weekly basis.  Once our members start hitting lvl60 we will figure something out.
---
That being said: Players with raid (lead) experience are definitely welcome to join us.
---
**Sounds like your cup of tea?**
---
If you want an invite or more info you can whisper the following people (preferably during our active hours ;)):
---
* Paine
---
* Firelord
---
* Erner
---
* Vicus
---
* Reubo
---
* Buts / Girlgonewild
---
Or: you can send me a pm here :).
---
Yeah, especially during leveling a lot of quests give food as reward, but almost never water. Meaning I often lifetap before eating as it is cheaper :).

The one where developers build in a backdoor: ElvUI
---
I've just stopped healing warlocks and orcs who use blood fury. They know the risks, the only heals they get are chain heal bounces.
---
Thanks for agreeing with me however one dude getting a slight advantage due to playing more under normal terms is not the same as people running around with the majority of the economy of a realm due to layering xD
---
Here you can take online courses so you will be able to grasp the basics of economics, free of charge! https://alison.com/courses/economics
---
1000g ? what are you talking about lol
---
Is it true it's full of stoners?
---
Can't acces it from work apparently. 
---
I've tried looking up a couple guides (Jame's horde leveling guide for instance) and it's not very efficient if you haven't followed it from the start. Maybe this one is better tho, I'll check it when I get home.
---
Nah man each brings it's own things to the run.
---
Also if someone is engineer he would be able to open it possible.
---
That's like a mage selling water/food to the party.
---
If you are doing a dungeon is group first player last. Always. More so in Raids.
---
The rogue would be kicked back in the day for sure. In fact what he did was close to ninja looting. If he was so adamant to have the chest loot he should speak about it before opening.
---
The hunter turned into major asshole dough, and got out of the picture worse than the rogue.
---
I haven’t seen anything but it is wow....
---
You got the Wrong Warchief. Thrall aint bad. Queen Bitch Sylvannas is the problem!. Kill her and Avoid her Wonder Boi Dramas.
---
I stopped at the end of WotLK and havent played since.
---
I am hooked on classic and will properly add it as my new hobby for a few nights a week and when i can get away with it.
---
I love the game and its all that i had hoped for.
---
Uhm, what do you use to capture gameplay with?
---
Check out those guides. There's also Dragonscale LW which specializes in Mail items, whereof the Black Dragonscale set is pretty high up there on the pre-raid BiS list. Massive Attack Power on every piece and some crit/hit set bonus, as I recall.
---
It's still possible to solo things, but you will be slower than other classes. So when I am specced holy I will farm through herbs/alch instead of farming mobs. You want to have a seperate healing and shadow set if you plan on respeccing.
---
Yeh this is so weird.  I am also getting downvoted for pointing out that most of my friendbase do the same thing since they have money but no time and still would like to play somewhat competitive.
---
I'm leveling my first shaman on NoggenFogger, currently lvl 15, pm if you'd like to play with me
---
How much for the boots ? 
---
I just loot them and want to sell them at the AH
---
In groups anything is possible but you have to talk first. Loot is loot, you don't remove loot without the groups permission.
---
I don't serve the UdSSR, nice try u communist pig
---
Take my silver totem brother
---
To be fair that might just work better. I was running SM the other day, doing it properly but the group wanted to pull a lot of mobs, and I have no AoE threat abilities and I can only tab-target spam sunders on so many. Healer said we could pull more so that's why we did it, but when I couldn't even hold aggro and all other party members taking damage, it was just better for the group if I went dps (with the occasional taunt here and there) instead too. 
---
It made little difference for the healer anyway since they were already healing everyone and we got a little more dps from it, so depending on how your healer feel and the overall group dps, running without a tank and 4 dps might be preferrable.
---
I am a druid that usually tanks I tell them to life tap  so I can heal them since I don't use mana that much and we can all move faster.
---
I agree if it is the healer healing it is not efficient
---
I quit a bit earlier, but basically this. Retail has no chance
---
&gt; First off, has the community gotten to point that joining now leaves you leagues behind? 
---
No
---
&gt; Second, any tips for this game? Iv played quite a few mmorpgs, but nothing quite as big as wow.
---
Use addon to show quest locatons
---
&gt; And lastly, is the community decently friendly?
---
Not really, I ran Dead-mines for old times sake, and was legitimately wondering if I could sneak into Stockades.
---
&gt; Guilds and pugs aren't even letting warriors be fury
---
What do you mean by this? I'm level 40 and have no idea what's going on at endgame - fury warriors aren't allowed in MC now?
---
Arcane blast does not exist in classic...
---
Downrank appropriately. Don't use your highest rank of greater heal or you will go oom very fast.
---
This is what happened with the guild I raided in,  in Vanilla. We got to Naxx and did it a little bit and people started getting really bad burnout to the point where we could no longer field enough to raid in general.

---
Hey, thank you for answering my questions.
---
Wc3
---
Even as a healer I much prefer the added flexibility of more keybinds (alt+ whatever) over a self heal button like that. My mouseover macros already make the heal target me if I have no friendly target selected.
---
Still worth it on a big pull as a preheal
---
 At least to me
---
Pretty good progress for having to work on the side
---
its not jsut him
---
Considering I can't seem to login anymore after the recent DDoS attack (Linux user), I've flocked back to EUIV and M&amp;B: Warband for the time being. Retail is a joke and the grind of Classic has even started to get to me. I had a few good interactions with people on Sulfuras, but I may not re-up, especially if I can't login on my Linux machine. Not installing Windows for one game.
---
Warlock pulls everything with siphon life at lvl 30 then proceeds to bubble themselves with sacrifice from their voidwalker.  
---
If the mobs don't die you can be there to bubble the warlock. 
---
Could also do this in dungeons
---
I even crafted a bunch of extra wool and silk bags and sent to lvl 1-4 fellow Forsaken.
---
If you have a computer that runs windows XP or later. You can run wow. If your computer is truly outdated , then you won’t be able to run it at max settings. If you just can’t run it smoothly even at low settings. Then your computer is probably 20 years old. At that point. You really do need to go out and get a new computer. You can get low end computers that outpace gaming machines from 10 years ago for only a couple hundred bucks. May not be able to run the latest and greatest games. But still able to run most anything else, even if it is just on low settings.
---
Level 38. I hope to be lvl 60 somewhere around the end of September.
---
I've been trying to convince my guild to move from Gehennas but they're convinced it's a dead server and they'd rather queue for 3+ hours....
---
So I'd love an answer to this to hopefully convince them to consider it more seriously.
---
I farmed the Syndicate up in Alterac from like 37-40 and had enough money for my mount.
---
I farmed there because it was quiet and I enjoyed killing those packs, was a few chests too but seldom anything good in.
---
I prefer humanoids as a Rogue as I can pickpocket them, they aren't immune to my poisons and I can sometimes disarm them.
---
Also I'm not a skinner, so no extra lewt from beasties for me.
---
if youre a healer, you can realistically go in -2 to -10 levels from this graph. rfc for example is probably -2, anything that 'requires' 58+ you could enter at 48-49 and be perfectly fine. MC or ony you could do from 55+
---

Is this affecting other games to because all day the Sydney Apex Legends servers were extremely laggy?

---
Healer here. Unless critical to win the fight, I don't mind letting arrogant DPS:ers die every now and then. Play stupid games, win stupid prices.  
---
That said; so far I've had mainly positive experiences doing instances in Classic. Most people are nice, and knows their stuff - both tonks and DPS. Wiped once in Deadmines and one time in Shadowfang Keep, but both was due to a bit of bad luck rather than any outstanding fuckery.

It is charming no doubt.

Microsoft have been involved in Linux for years. Contrary to popular opinion, it's in their best interest to treat Linux with respect as it's all scrutinised openly by the community.
---
ExFAT support in Linux is really, really useful. With .NET Core and the transition of Microsoft services into the Linux world, the sheer number of enterprise systems that want/need legitimate ExFAT support to handle communication with fileshares between Windows and Linux worlds is massive. Like, more massive than the entire desktop userbase.

where is phone?
---
Solus/Lutris here. Affected as well. Why doesn't Blizzard have a service like Cloudflare in front of their servers?

Guess you’re not so &lt;indecisive&gt; after all
---
I have heard this about 90 times the last weekend. It haunts me in my sleep and now at work? I am fucking done.
---
Or it's the tanks fault. Idk why reddit believes every tank player is a perfect player and never messes up. I shouldn't be able to pull off a tank with non-crit frostbolts, it's often because the tank wants to deal "damage" over just pressing sunder over and over. I've been pugging dungeons at 60 and it's very easy to tell a bad tank from a good tank, even during AoE pulls a good tank will keep threat off of me.
---
I mean that doesnt really represent the retail player base does it, Op most be at the top 1% of worst players since doing normal dungeons was barley worth doing at the start of uldir since you could handle Mythic 0 from the get go witch gave better gear
---
my jaw stayed open for at least 30 seconds. Glad to see I wasn't the only one.
---
Read the post again
---
I think I paid about 7g for mine. I saw a few on the AH for 7-10g earlier. It'll vary by server. When there are only 1-2 pairs, people will try to price them at about 15g, so just be patient as there shouldn't be any demand at those prices.
---
Just sounds like a Bad Warlock to me. If I wanted a Heal as a Warlock I would say "Only Heal me when I stand next to you, otherwise just focus on the Tank".
---
There is a big chance it was just a 14 year old. Always keep in mind that there are actual children playing alongside sometimes.
---
„Fly, you fools!“
---
No I don't care about that at all, prefer english speaking community, but I don't want to play on the US timezones. So basically looking for an english EU server that is "nice" , good population, good faction balance and PVP.
---
That is SO classic.
---
Oh man. All the memories floating back. 
---
I cant. I cant. I cant.
---
It is impossible to hold aggro. Did the exact thing described (warrior tank and 3 mages with slow etc) and the only thing I could contribute with was to round the mobs up first, use Piercing Howl for initial slow and then let the mages to go town. As soon as they started Blizzarding my aggro was off.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
'why'd you let me die?'...
---
"It's called self care sweetie"
---
It is really sad that MMOs are this dead were a 15 year old game can come out and be arguably better than all of the current ones. Like Imagine a MMO that is just as good as vanilla, just with this days tech...Sad.
---
I think the main Oce server is ally sided.
---
No it's not a cast, you're just using an object. 
---
Though it's probably not the best way to fakecast because a smart player will wait a little bit to get a feeling of what you're casting (what school at least) but last time I tried to fakecast the other mage was so quick I didn't have time to stop my cast so it might be worth trying.
---
Nah. I've pretty much only logged into BFA for guild raids since Classic came out. We also seem to have about half the raid size in BFA now than we did before Classic came out.
---
Also, a lot of people in my friends list who as far as I know hadn't played for years, are now playing Classic.
---
I was only ever referring to boes generally too though, you presumed I went specific
---
True. Druids have a high skill ceiling, best utilise it to make yourself stand out. 
---
Also, if blizzard do progress to tbc, druids and warlocks will become popular classes anyway.
---
That's good to hear. On Mograine atm and the twitchers are starting to grate on me. Holding out hope that Blizzard will eventually do paid server transfers!
---
Really? Why? Not enough to do?
---
I keep telling my friends to enjoy the leveling phase. Based on how they play, I can already predict that they won't have much to do once they hit 60.
---
How does the OS you use even come up in game play?
---
NPCs, the people you talk to and are scattered around the world are called NPCs.  The term mob is used more for groups of enemy NPCs or just single enemy NPCs
---
I didn't participare in the SM spam and was 16g short at 40. By the time I hit 41 I was able to pay it back.
---
Just quest and gather, it'd lucrative.
---
As warlock you have a lot of options, different minions, different curses. In PVP you need to learn when to use the niche abilities that are good vs different classes.  
---
Also try to practice with the spells of your minions, like Seduce (Succubus)  and Spell Lock (Felhunter, lvl 30)  these can be key to victory and it is best when you manually control them
---
That song was top of the charts in Russia for a few weeks about 6 months ago. Also - skibidi means nothing in Russian. Go figure.

This is fucked up.

I also cant comment on the forums (despite having selected 120s and classic characters, logged out and in, and browsed for hours), nor can I **post a ticket** (the last button for posting is grayed out for me now).
---
Blizzard really have decided they dont give a fuck anymore...
---
I mostly use https://classic.wowhead.com/ as it has guides to virtually every facet of the game. It has some great guides to classes, professions, zones, quests, levelling guides... you name it! 
---
Its helped me loads. I've got about half a dozen guides bookmarked on a tablet in front of me as I play, showing me where to go for decent quest items and what zones &amp; dungeons suit me at my level. 
---
And of course you are gonna need some addons too. Get the twitch client. Classic has it's own file separate from "retail" and there are loads of addons that will help you.
---
Shame
---
I wouldn't go so far as to say the last 10 years of gaming as a whole, but certainly the last 10 years of WoW gaming hasn't been as fun as the two weeks of Classic I have played so far.
---
Lmao what a weird way to define if someone’s being an asshole. You’re really arguing that taking a wholistic economic perspective is the correct way of defining being a dick?
---
That’s like arguing that using an impvorished country’s cheap labor is morally just because economically someone gains in the same quantity. I’ll tell you what, as ridiculous as it may be, at least your argument is original. Can’t say I’ve ever heard someone make it at least.
---
You can justify a whole bunch of morally destable shit with it too, so it’s pretty convenient.

---
We need an AMA with the man himself.
---
The layers are fantastic for their purpose. It was an absolute clusterfuck everywhere to get any quest done and the game was all about tagging mobs before others could, quests would take obscene amounts of time because there would be so many players camping mob spawns. It was brinking on unplayable a lot of the time.  
---
With appropriate layering you can keep an overpopulated server while having a reasonable player density for questing. You don't want too many or too few players and without layering it would be an absolute clusterfuck like it was on the private server.
---
The idea of unrestricted open world PvP in a game where strength is 90% determined by time spent playing is completely fucking retarded on all levels.
---
Exactly this.
---
Only thing I grinded for was pathfinding part 2. Why? So it'll be easier when I level up my alts for the next expansion.
---
Chasing after mobs and getting hit by the others in the back, getting less threat because the mobs attacking the mage are not hitting you and not getting any revenge procs either.   
---
Very frustrating.
---
The true classic experience!
---
ah the job satisfaction :D
---
they get resist instead
---
Yeah, follow a class guide. Your money will be tight as you level. By the time you're in your 20s you'll see those abilities costing a lot of silver and virtually cleaning you out every 2 levels if you buy everything. I don't have much experience with your class, but I think it's about the same for most; you will not need EVERY spell whilst levelling. And no, you probably wont need that 90/100g mount at level 40 like most others do. I'm a hunter so its debatable if I will either as I have my own run speed buff that's almost as good. But I'd still like to have plenty of gold as I grow, rather than worrying if I can afford stuff from the auction house.
---
I also recommend just having 2 collecting professions too; i.e. skinning, herbalist, mining. Even just selling to npc vendors and not the AH will help boost your income. Crafting professions are okay, but they do not generate a lot of gold, in fact they end up costing you materials just to level up. I tried leather working again just to see if it was possible to make money rather than spending it, but sadly no. My advice is to save crafting for your endgame and passing items onto your next characters (they call them twinks btw!).

I understand where you're coming from, but then isn't every boe item a greed roll? Because realistically, every character could go sell any item and get an equivalent value item from the AH.
---
I've always wished that rolling need turned the item into BoP.

Imo most blue or epic boes should be held onto unless you have someone who will pay good money for it, otherwise they’re getting it for a tiny fraction of the price it’ll be worth

Ha, I can't begrudge anyone if they did that to me, I'm sure they were laughing their ass off.
---
They'd still go on my kill-list of course.

You'll have to get one first anyway unless you were planing to take your time. Can't get the lock mount until Phase 2.

An Alliance was walking away from the road to avoid an incoming patrol, I noticed it and sapped the Alliance so he got aggroed and died.
---
Fair enough - maths checks out. 8 hours a day work, 7 hours (avg. in weekends) playing WoW, leaves 9 hours for sleep/life/travelling to and from work.
---
Sometimes I wish I could live like that - life gets in the way a lot for me. Good luck to 60!

Congrats dude, I did not expect to see you here honestly :)
---
Can't say for sure whether they actually removed it completely, but I certainly haven't seen it look anywhere near as good as in Classic for pretty much as long as I can remember. It really does wonders for the atmosphere.
---
Might also just be because in BFA (or really any expansion post-WotLK) I haven't really spent as much time hanging around the old vanilla areas.
---
I just started last night and played vanilla at launch. The community has been great. I was getting random buffs from PC's all night, and a dude was in my starter zone just making linen bags for people as long as they provided the mats.

---
They hardly ever do anything to help Linux; the Linux community has done practically all of the work themselves to make WoW run on Linux. We're not asking for help from Blizzard, we just want them to not actively prevent us playing on Linux like they're doing now.
---
The market share of Linux is a few percent, usually 3-5; which may not seem like much but with millions of players that's easily tens of thousands of people.
---
Why are hunters always worst?I had a hunter in dungeon complaining entire run about us ccing mobs and stuff despite run going smoothly.

He then wanted to skip entire two packs of mobs by a jump shortcut which killed two other guys when they jumped into lava .All to save 3-4 minutes.Ofc he run out of arrows cause his quiver was half empty before run

I saw it described as "You get to blame the hunter for everything that goes wrong in a dungeon, and they get to roll on all the loot that drops. That's the agreement."
---
And honestly? It's perfect.
---
This is a sentence completely lost to some Mages of today. A few willy-swinging streamers showing their SM cleave setups on Twitch have turned some of my dungeon sessions as a healer into a real nightmare.

I leveled blacksmith to 80 regretted it and started leveling eng. It's my highest profession already, easy as cakes to level up if you have mining.
---
world pvp is pretty much a mess that is closer to raid i guess. I am not a vanilla veteran to claim something... but i guess there is no need to adjust your build based on type of server.   
---
While playing solo u rather calmly die from sneaking rogue or wondering mage and accept it as part of experience. LOL.  But any other time if you  have a group and u'll see a rogue... DESTROY HIM! Use any advantage u can to hunt them down. All of this is part of fun.  
---
Hell i cant imagine how boring it must be to questing in STV on pve server. SOOooo boooooring. And on pvp it is a massacre! Bloodbath! World of WARRRRRrrrr! lol

me and another mage rolled 98, on the reroll i got 78 he got 32
---
The best Races for Mage are:
---
A: Gnome

H: Undead or Troll. 
---
If you're looking to get the most out of your class.
---
Sure the economy will inflate. That's a given. Gold **will** become cheaper, thus making mounts and skills cheaper, and NPC vendors more profitable.
---
Here's the thing, though, stuff **will** flood markets and it *might* become cheaper too. This means that if you hoard your reagents and loot, they increase in value, because the gold loses value, but at the same time they lose value, because more people get the stuff and enter these assets into the open market. Will the gold inflation be bigger than the loss of value from stuff overflooding markets? Will it be less? Even? To be honest, fuck knows which way this equilibrium will go. I'd say that some stuff will actually lose value in time more so I'd recommend you actually selling stuff without severely undercutting and being patient in your trades.
---
If I lose interest in classic probably the last thing I'm gonna do is to go and play retail, since retail simply doesn't have anything of interest for me
---
I know, I have both on different machines
---
I had a fellow paladin run by me with several gnolls chasing him in redridge last week and so I decided to help him. He didn’t even turn around to help me after I grabbed aggro. Just started killing else. 
---
So I used BoP and watched him get dog piled with adds.
---
SHES DEAD?
---
I think what has amazed me the most so far is the sheer number of *new* players Classic has brought in. As in, people who had *never* even played WoW Retail before.
---
I was running Gnomer (\*shudder\*) and overaggroed (#hunterthings). Next thing the Priest says "OMG, I thought my game bugged! What happened to your health!? You went from full to zero to full again!" - so I had to explain what Feign Death was (cause you can't link anything apart from items in chat). After playing since launch in 2004 I was honestly surprised that someone didn't know about it - turns out it was his first time playing the game. He and a couple of friends had decided to give it a try after seeing something about it online.
---
I always feel bad for killing warriors pre 60 honestly. As someone who has leveled 3 warriors to max level (one on pserver 1x rate, and two back in vanilla) I know the god damn pain of leveling. I just dont have the HEART to attack them. If anything, I usually hit the mob they are trying to kill. Feel for those poor bastards.
---
You will always find people getting 60 around the same time as you! There is no need to stress. There is a big hysteria around the getting to 60 part now, but The fact is most of us are just casual players and will not be reachin 60 for a While yet!
---
Why not?
---
As both having a Druid and a warlock alliance side. This makes me feel wanted

I totally agree with this. However when you would run full pvp gear, there is no spirit to double...
---
Technically impossible. 
---
There aren't enough regular quests, and the repeatable runecloth turn-in is not being unlocked until later levels.
---
You’re not wrong.
---
I mean they added layering to increase server capacity in response to people getting stuck in queue. There was a blue post on server capacity increase and the long queues were gone immediately.

You're right, seen this in some arena vod.

More of 60 i guess :P

Often times as a tank I expect and tell DPS to prioritize killing weaker mobs and then I don't even bother tanking those. There are a lot of non elite trash or caster mobs around that DPS can go all out on and offtank.
---
I really think in long run it will be better. It will be a total shit show when the layers are off. Imagine 3 times more people on the only layer or 3 times more queues on mograine.
---
Incorrect. Legolasxx007 is the correct name, because he is a secret agent too bro! /s
---
M+ skittish is far worse than classic lol.
---
Layering was a "huge concern" prior to launch because of the way they were testing it. You switched layers by being invited to a group, and it was easier abused in the testing phase. As well, people were posting pictures of empty Ironforge and whatnot as proof that "layering is shit". But those were during the test with less overall players anyway.
---
The key concept to realize is that Vanilla servers had a population cap of 3,000 players. Here in Classic, each layer has a cap of 3,000 players as well. You didn't notice layering because you're not supposed to. It's supposed to be invisible to you because the world is quite populated with a large of amount of people within a single layer. If you and your friends are on the same layer, you will stay on the layer unless you get invited to a group by someone in a different layer. If you get invited to a group by people in the same layer, you do not switch layers.
---
There are still some exploits with layering, but they aren't a big deal anyway.
---
Alright, 10g was the price i was going to try.
---
I haven't touched the game since Cataclysm and I'm loving classic.  It's the only reason why I re-subbed last night. It's the first time I've had a wow sub since Cataclysm ruined everything.

Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.

I would take the same spec but take out improved mind blast for improved mana burn
---
Sure. But it has been working OK since I started using Linux back in 2008 or so. If I won't be able to continue playing like I've been since then I will definitely cancel my sub until they fix it.
---
Wait until you hit 50 and young folks are going to explain "everything" to you :)
---
That’s true, unless you run some weird shadow dmg+spirit combo instead of or if you don’t have pvp gear
---
Draenor with Alleria and Turalyon
---
Uninstalled BfA yesterday to free up cpu space.
---
I was agreeing with you
---
You said that it has "0 effect on PVP" which is wrong. I said that it has a minimal effect, which is more accurate.
---
Live to win!
---
People are reporting that switching to ipv6 solves the Linux issue.
---
Use both, of course.
---
Imagine touching STV, i just lvld to 40 with southshore and arathi
---
How can you run it? I've tried wine on Ubuntu 19.04 and it crashes when I try to run it.
---
I think it is closer to 10-11 hours a day averaged out with the three days I was not able to play on accounted for. But I also think I played about 18 hours each day I did not have work.
---
Okay, I'm sorta proud of this. I wasn't even going to bother when I saw the Goblin make his announcement, but I turned around after a little thought and hopped in the arena. Took out a ?? level Troll hunter, a 35 Dwarf hunter and a 38 warrior jumped in on the fun. I bubbled, he tried to get the chest, I healed and clicked off my bubble, and stun Seal of command crit him to death. :)
---
I will check it out, thanks!

**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] Nethergarde Keep | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Likely one 40 man per week, most likely Monday, around 19-23 CET. Raid times are up for discussion still. (Plus optional 20 mans when they come out.)
---
* Loot council.
---
* A few more Warriors and Paladins are especially welcome!
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
Oy I am giving healthstones to most people who buff me
---
Cool man, I enjoyed the video. 
---
Two questions.  
---
1. what skills do they all play a role in this? So what are you doing exactly? 
---
2. how can I resist the monster damage?
---
Idk I play Alliance but I saw some screenshots from his Discord and a screenshot of youtube channels he subscribe and comments on(I checked it out) and both his comments and the channels themselves are pretty alt right. But best you can do is go to his Discord channel and see for yourselves.
---
Yeah I've never found this many leveling before. They started dropping once I started AoE farming in Tanaris and WPL
---
...fine, but im still mad at blizzard.
---
i guess i was still stuck on the "muh sekrit klub" aspect of it all, in my head i was the little farmer who was getting a highway built through his home.
---
Altough most of it is personal preference, what really made it easier for me was clearing the C, B, V, N keys and moving the menus to somewhere else. Those keys are incredibly easy yo reach and i use them for instant casts because you press them with your thumb. This way, you can use them while being completely movable, sk there's moonfire, insect swarm, fairy fire, all that good stuff on those keys.
---
For classic, i also have a keybind to move back to human form (shift space)
---
Whats important for me is availability of all spells at all time. Thats why my heals and dmg spels are always in the cast bar on the same icon as always. For example, regrowth is always on e, no matter bear or cat or human form. Same goes for every spell i have. This means that i need extra space for my feral abilities but it all fits on my end.
---
Im personally not a fan of mice with thousands of buttons.
---
I only have a mouse with two side buttons, one for autorun, the other is my alt key to enable self cast at any time without breaking my fingers. Hope this helps!
---
I live in the US, not the EU.  My old bags go to by bank.  
---
I thought bags were BoP?
---
Yeah, mages shouldnt make food and water for their team, warlocks shouldnt make healthstones, healers should only heal themselves.
---
The person literally said they were, as well as posting pictures of Asmon raging.
---
Your guildname doesn't fit your actions!
---
If there's nothing to do, then do something else. It's not like WoW has to be the only game you play. Log in when there's something to do or roll an alt.
---
&lt;Insert "If (pick one of the attackers) if your reason for feeling bad, then you must stop playing WoW" comment here&gt;
---
Not disrespecting - it's mad how one can spend 18 hours on a game in a day. I know because I did the same on Tuesday/Wednesday after release - up at 6AM and slept at midnight. The Thursday after launch I was back in work and I've slowed right down. Life "got in the way" on the weekend and I had family events to get involved with.
---
Haha, fun fact. I think majority of pvp priest will run both shadow and healing and will also PVE so they will likely have some spirit gear indeed :)
---
The cool but also annoying thing is those drops you get from those dungeons often carry you for a long time too. It's not "oh I got this but will replace in a few quests".
---
At least for my priest, I carried most of the drops from SFK up until my mid-40s when I got my tailoring up to crafter mageweave gear or run ZF.
---
What's your addons? :)
---
Threat Management is a group effort. There are many players who don't know about it, and they make it extra hard for you. Tell the to wait a few seconds before they attack
---
F****ng lunatic making my hands sweat like that
---
Apart from gnomes which are kos (PTSD) from vanilla I pretty much leave them alone. I find if I'm playing a rogue I tend to be more aggressive but most of the time pretty chilled.
---
Just dual boot into windows. What's the issue? I use Windows for gaming and ubuntu for everything else.
---
Depends on the sit... And my mood lolz i can quest beside an alli for sure but if i get a sense of hostility or that they a group i tend to gank one or two and vanish for a bit while i assess the area, maybe do it again if they attack other of my faction
---
It makes the game so much better. While I was waiting for the zeppelin from Undercity to Orgrimmar, I complimented this guys hat, and he gave me 1g (I only had like 9s at the time) for spells. :D
---
ah that would explain the purple lotus:  it's skill 210  and most people in ashenvale have herbing maxed at 150, maybe 165 for tauren.  Not many people would be able to pick it.  Also all the other herbs in Ashenvale are skilll 70-150, so those losses are out of place anyway, just a little trolling by the game devs..  'look what you cannot pick up'  hahahaha
---
Feelsbad, i havent gotten single 10 or 12 slot drop, and im lvl 40 still waiting for someone to sell mageweave in AH for non insane prices so i can craft my own 12 slots, seriosly who buys mageweave for 8s ea, anything above 4-5s is just wasting ur deposit money
---
I'll try that, thanks.
---
If your healing a warlock more than the tank and not understanding why that is then you just dont know how the class works.
---
Yeah right? Seems like an awesome crossfaction interaction.
---
Nah I blame blizzard, blanket banning non uUS and Linux users if some shit tier IT security.
---
Shadowfang, assassins blade, another one that I forgot
---
The thing is you’re pulling the one the tank has most aggro on so it’s not too hard for us to get it back. The hunters that multi shot on pull are taking multiple things from us, and the mobs are then running toward them lol 
---
I don’t mind one bit a melee class taking aggro from me because I can leisurely take it back after I get aggro on all of them and know the melee will be fine. Hunters will just stop what they’re doing to run around or just change to the target I’m on and then get healed and now it’s a save the healer moment.
---
Since somewhere in the middle of Cataclysm I had been subscribed for only the beginning month of each expansion excluding Bfa which I didn't even purchase. This was enough to realize how little appeal was left from the game I once loved.
---
I particularly remember that abomination of WoD where I had a super-hard time of even playing with my friend as we were in different phases of some quests all the time and then had my very own instanced castle which was anti-community and anti-immersion beyond belief.
---
Then Legion made everything scale, which was even worse. Like why would I even want to improve my character when all content scales to my level anyways? I didn't even play that entire month and stopped at Level 102.
---
what events do take place in vanilla? And are there event quests with rewards aswell?
---
Amazing how many barrens raptors can live without heads though.....
---
Gabe runs a platform that directly competes with Windows store. There was also a time where Valve was/still is afraid of Windows denying Steam access. Gabe has an economic interest in Linux. Blizzard only serve a fraction of what Valve does.
---
Once a week I try to give them a chance. If I see someone questing, I won't attack them. But I always end up regretting it, so I lose all remorse for those apes and kill them on sight.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
The people are Grade A, that's cool. But the game has a perfect amount of difficulty imo.
---
The game is just difficult enough for other people to realize it and help others, it's interesting.
---
Oh yes I remember good old times when I did this in Hyjal on 4th boss, never in Vanilla tho, will try for sure
---
Smh should be the 22 pound catfish
---
You arent wrong. They send kids straight out of tech school to work on the networks but it's still more secure than your average company network with contractors with DISA, F5, and Microsoft.
---
Hahaha nice work
---
Also, never walk on the wrong side or inside of the river.... One side is save death, the other side is a chill walk :)
---
Red = Dead
---
I kept saying this but I’m related to one such dumbass hunter and am leveling with him...
---
3 amigos from The Office.. Parkor!
---
Gets more fun after 3rd if its a fair fight tho.
---
But comon i cant stop myself from ambushing sitting people. 
---
People are actually sitting to be critted again!
---
I just leave them alone. If I got mana to spare I between fights they get a heal otherwise they don't.
---
The point is you want people who are getting carried to earn the same rewards as the people doing the carrying, and you're branding anyone who disagrees with that an elitist.
---
Hordler? Is that some kind of insult involving hordes and toddlers or just a weird autocorrect?
---
Druids do not fight druids (usually)
---
I like to do this while I wait for healer mana but I wait !
---
It is worth a lot
---
We had the same thing, only our cat dies in april.
---
My girlfriend resurected him by creating a NE Hunter and taming a lion, named him and now he lives forever ❤️
---
Another issue is people seem to have the mentality everyone needs to be at 100% all the time.
---
If they're anywhere from 50-80% they're fine.
---
None of those worked, tried earlier. Thanks for trying to help though
---
Imagination will have to suffice.
---
... we still drone the tits off people.  Having orange man makes absolutely no difference on this front.
---
That's only for people spell cleaving dungeons. If you want to do the same find a melee cleave party
---
create your own group, stop being entitled dps'er that are to lazy to organise other 4 players
---
&gt;Gnome Mage
---
Ah there’s your problem. No Horde can resist the temptation to crush a gnome.
---
Australian ignore ipv6 and only use Ipv4
---
Hey this is my server. 
---
Guys killing rag already meanwhile I'm still dying to scorpions im Desolace
---
Doesn't even know their own class, feels competent telling others how to play theirs, smh.
---
It's not about the subs. If they lost 0.1% of their playerbase but avoided all the negative publicity they'd probably happily take the trade.
---
Im 30. Taking a break for a few days.  There are so few legit quests between 28-32 and grinding mobs is incredibly boring.  Trying to avoid burnout.
---
My PC's official "name" is TOASTER-V2, as it replaced the 2012 budget PC I gamed on for 6 years, aptly named TOASTER.

---
You've never been more than a couple of weeks behind in WoW in terms of character progression. Classic WoW you could fall maybe 5 weeks behind at most.
---
Bruh how did u get elite playerframe to work I tried for hours ;c
---
I say it has 0 effect because, to my knowledge, your skill is maxed out and you can’t go higher than that even if you have the human racial/orc racial/talents/maladath/core hound tooth etc.
---
Tell them to attack the skull. Realize that nobody listens and attacks everything but the skull. Sigh, throw your paws up in the air and give up and just keep aggro on the skull mob whilst everyone runs around kiting the rest or if they finally decide to use some CC then that's actually progress. They've achieved next level enlightenment.
---
Never stopped retail. Logging in for the mythic raids, one weekly m+ and IE like i have been doing ever since i got rustbolt&amp;unshackled exalted. Playing classic outside of that but losing interest in it fast, with new path of exile league out and borderlands 3 looming over the horizon.
---
Turn it down to ”Classic” i preffer the old atmosphere
---
Moved from Firemaw to Earthshaker with my guild on the evening it opened. First night and friday, the server felt very underpopulated but now it reminds me very much of my old ”high-pop” server back in vanilla. More and more lvl 60s and a number of other Alliance guilds have transfered over. Regarding horde/alli-balance, they have ganked me in Ashenvale and we have ganked them in Southshore. It is nothing like the clusterfuck that was being chain-ganked on Firemaw. 
---
Some of our highlevels are feeling that they need to work harder for Lbrs/Ubrs/Brd-groups. But that is also the way I remember Vanilla, the constantly spam of 10 ppl needing ppl in town-chat was surely pratical but felt more like a pserver with mega-pop
---
This sounds like a problem with your playstyle again, not the warlocks. Why are you going oom healing a dps?
---
*ARCANITE REAPER! HOOOO!*
---
This is a weird assumption. Ofc i do this, but most of the time i get ”how many mages in group yet?” As answer
---
With Morsak?
---
Guatafuc sounds like he is trying to say "get fucked".
---
I tried to go through the Steppes at around that level as well, back in the day. Aggro'd a skull level spider from a mile away and just about shit myself. Never went back until I was the right level lol
---
Watch the WoW Radio interviews. They had him on last week. He seems... different. And depressed.
---
https://vimeo.com/358758684
---
Ghosts. No Joke.
---
Yeah, my guild (250 members) has three 40+.  I'm in the top 25 at level 30.
---
The walking dead approach... I can dig dat. ☺️☺️☺️
---
Many addons dont show up there. Just try /willitclassic.
---
Many had a menue being pulled up that way.
---
I personally only use vendorprices, classicdruid manabar and quartz since my raid frames are in the lower middle and id have my cast bar over them.
---
Thank you. I already knew other terminology like LF and stuff, I just didnt know what PuG stands for. But additional info never hurts :)
---
Google Remote Desktop
---
Yeah I’m leveling a hunter on the side and every dungeon it gets mentioned how it’s not a huntard behind the mask and it’s funny but at the same time unfortunate that we all just assume it’s a huntard until proven thoroughly otherwise lmao 
---
I even had to lend arrows to another hunter who was joking about me being the better hunter, game them a quick jab of “Oh yeah the good hunter stocked up. Here ya go” lol
---
Bruh.mp3
---
I have a /Curtsey one I use.
---
This man is a fucking legend. Let's all strive to be more like Chestnutz and his massive chestnuts.
---
I assume convenience and trying to do more than one thing at a time.
---
I felt this in my soul
---
RIP my man. That is definitely what I didn't want to do for Classic, because I knew what came wafterwards wasn't going to be worth it. That said, I'm about to hit 30, so that's the downside. 
---
Still, I probably would have burned out way before 60 if I did it your way. At least you know it's not healthy.
---
It was an example. Most script kitties use ICMP packets to DoS players offline.
---
So you've been playing for 15 years and haven't realized what threat is ? I'd rather have a dps do insane damage and pull aggro than spend an eternity in a dungeon.
---
&gt; getting carried
---
Fuck off back to retail with your "IF YOU ARENT THE TOP SPEC IN THE GAME YOU ARE BEING CARRIED" attitude. Literally fuck off. That isn't how the game works.
---
I hate such things i hope they get sued for that.
---
I don't give a shit about meta, i ran WC with a hunter and a lock pet tanking (i'm a mage) and we crushed it, last night i ran BFD with 2 enhancement shamens off healing, a warrior tank and a rogue and we crushed it, we had to play a little differently but that is part of the fun. When i get to higher dungeons i suppose i might not be able to fuck around as much but i'll try any tactic.
---
If somebody refuses to accept you into a group because of "the meta" they are morons and you probably don't want to group with them anyway, make your own group :).
---
i dont get this. you know about the "Find Herbs" skill right?
---
I am buying blues from the AH for my lvl 26 druid....  (no higher lvl character) And I plan to have 250g by lvl 40.   Some of us just enjoy the economic game and a few smart investments can go a long way.  You just have to check for underpriced money items, that are posted often at the start of the game.
---
Example: 
---
Let's say somebody finds a Tiny Emerald Whelpling. 
---
Ok a rare pet, a popular collectible.   it will be worth a lot eventually.    100g?  who knows. but let's say 100g as a working number.  
---
Ok so you will obviously not get 100g for it right now. people don't have the gold for those luxuries yet.   So the finder tries to sell it.  He doesn't find many buyers and nobody wants to pay much.  So in the end he sells it for 10g in the AH.. To me.    I resell it for 25g to somebody who knows it will be 100g eventually.  The finder has 10g.  I have 15g profit and the 2nd investor  waits and will have a bigger profit later on.  Everybody happy.
---
I can find one of such deals every day on average, and that eventually leads to me never having to worry about gold. 
---
It\s not free, you have to spend time, I am usually about 45 minutes  a day busy with this sort of stuff.  Time not spend leveling.
---
I think Naxx was the last one. After that you had ulduar where the game became more about complex boss mechanics.
---
Us Warriors gotta stick together. Doesn't matter which race we are, we all know the suffering of solo questing. If we meet outside of a scenario like this though, there will be battle.
---
Heal warlocks ONLY when you feel like you can spare the mana. We have Healthstones, Death Coil, Drain Life (many warlocks are drain tank specced while leveling and would often use that instead of shadowbolt after dots), Siphon Life and Demon Armor (health regen in combat).
---
Naturally, some warlocks over-tap and expect to always be healed, which is wrong and understandably pisses of healer. 
---
On the other side of the spectrum, nothing irks me more in a dungeon than being at 100% HP. 
---
We're mostly happy with just the odd Renew (or similar), really.
---
i had 30 gold at 35 and 70 gold at 40, and 90 midway through 41. i only quested and sold greens but trained zero spells. if you're saving from lvl 33 you're gonna be good
---
be me
---
level 29 mage
---
run into Stitches on the road
---
oh crap
---
oh wait
---
frost bolt kite back to town
---
Yes who's looted [Stitches' Femur](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3360/stitches-femur) now fatty
---
This level 38 is made the spec massively more fun, I'd suggest sticking to VW till 38
---
As a new tank (37 War)... Is there some good tip for AoE tanking (besides challenging shout) that I don't know about? Obviously I use demo shout but that causes very little threat.
---
People keep requesting big pulls but its very hard to keep aggro on more than 2 mobs reliably.
---
Man I was so sure vanilla would die of after a week and that I wouldn't even start playing. Started last week and it's been such a blast. Really hope blizzard and other gaming companies takes notes of why this was so successful.
---
They probably won't though. In their minds people want automation and mtx.
---
Possibly... lol
---
Aw man, positions like that do suck, I don't mean to accuse you of anything. Feel free to do this again one or two more months with a new artwork, and i'm sure someone will get you that sub! :D
---
How do you change it's name?
---
I cant rename any of my pets
---
Beoken Tooth has a 1.0 attack speed, Humar has 1.3. They do the same damage but Broken Tooth causes more spell pushback from the faster attack speed
---
Level 46 rogue here, having no problems joining groups at all..
---
Haha yeah. I know there here somewhere 😂🤣
---
Can someone please explain these layers to me? I constantly hear people asking for invutes to change their layer and I have no clue what it means
---
&gt; Everybody plays the game like he wants to Play it, if a healer has no relevant damage source and doesn´t want to get himself in Trouble he just won´t. 
---
I don't deny that. But how do you get yourself in trouble if you're DPSing with auto-attacks or a wand? Wanding and auto-attacking doesn't interrupt the five second rule and I am also only talking about dungeons, as raid healing is different. 
---
&gt; The few seconds Healer DPS will grant you won´t make the run smoother. Almost topped healer mana will tho.
---
As the game's history has shown it actually makes quite a huge difference in the end, especially if you are doing repeated runs for gear or exp. Trust me, that damage adds up fast. Heck, you admit it yourself you are doing it. The reason why people want healers to DPS as well is because it has become the norm over years. And private servers show that it is more than possible to do it while effectively healing and I can guarantee you the next few weeks of Classic alone will show it as well. 
---
Just answer me this question: what are you doing if your mana if basically full (over 70%), the tank is in  no danger and there's no big pull? Are you gonna stand around afk, DPS or spam heal the tank, wasting mana that's potentially needed for when things go south?
---
It's not really schooling other people. My opinion is just that dungeon and raid content is a group effort. Everyone should do their part as  best as they can.
---
"gatherer" will mark any nodes you have picked/mined of a resource, and also syncs with other players to build a library of all possible nodes, helping you plan a farming route or get an idea of where rare resources spawn. You'll be fine with both flicking between them every 20/30 seconds, or just keep herbs up most of the time. Minerals tend to spawn 99% of the time on large rocky things, not randomly in a field like herbs do, so just switch to minerals for a second or two when you're near a cliff or a mountain, then go back to herbs.
---
Or, you know, you could make your own groups.
---
Is it possible to get lockbox while fishing ? or is it only in floating wreckage ?
---
bruh....
---
You don't want to solo things as holy. The only exception would be farming DM plants with holy nova when it comes out. Consider rolling another character for that.
---
As for gear you absolutely need separate sets because all your good healing gear will have healing power on it, which does nothing for damaging spells. Hybrid gear that adds both healing and damage has much lower numbers than specialized pieces.
---
"Dragonborn" Knight
---
I LOL
---
I know, before WoW there was another game that simply showed minecraft gameplay in the trailer. Is there no rule for this??
---
I refuse to believe there's no more intelligent solution than banning a whole operating system.
---
If it's just a very short temporary workaround to have most of the playerbase back online, I can cope with it, but not as an actual solution.
---
Nah... he is saying that Ashenvale is great because its so terrible it makes the barrens awesome by comparison.
---
Tbh, I don't like more than 2 side-buttons on my mouse. I use higher sensitivity settings and pressing a side-buttons often messes up my movement.
---
Hah! Just reached lvl 40, look like a clown, broke af, but atleast i blaze it 360 to my quest objectives
---
I saw a tailorer named Gucci, making bags.....
---
Cat glaring at you makes this picture worth it.
---
Ayyy lmao
---
How can it be! Games are the cause of the violence!!! Lol
---
IDK how to. This was the default name.
---
The crazy DPS's stops around RFD/SM Cath I've seen.
---
There if I put a skull at pull, It's gonna be focused. If I only have one threat to up and the others only needing a shout spam and an occasional taunt It's OK.
---
You both should be ashamed of yourselves
---
Better story arc than game of thrones
---
When people make empty threats, it makes the victory that much more delicious. Reminds me of Cartman lapping up Scott Tenorman's tears.
---
I rarely engage and if i do it will be of an equal level, there is no honor in killing young.
---
Detente indeed.
---
I got the alliance welcoming party after stepping foot in Hillsbrad. Ganked by three people immediately. 
---
At least it makes the faction war feel more meaningful.
---
I sort of think the whole reason Blizzard finally launched Classic was to make people shut up about it since it was constantly brought up.  They put a smaller team on the project and took their sweet time, but the interest didn't die.  Interest in retail continued to wane.
---
I originally started playing WoW the weekend it launched because my friends that had played beta wouldn't shut up about it.  The last expansion I bought was Mists of Pandaria.  I never finished the questline there or got more than 1 or 2 levels on my character.  The last expansion I truly enjoyed was Wrath of the Lich King.  In wrath, I took a Shaman, Mage, Warrior and Death Knight to max level.  I was the raid leader in my guild with my shaman.  The rest of the characters were just my profession alts so I could make money.  We cleared all the Wrath content.  I kept playing into Cataclysm and leveled a Hunter and Paladin to see what the new world was like.    
---
Cataclysm is where things kind of took a turn for me.  LFR stuff replaced hanging out with my guild and downing content.  It became easy to tank everything, regardless of what spec you had.  I was interested in doing a tour of the 5 man dungeons when I leveled my Paladin and I didn't have to do much questing.  Queue as a tank in Dungeon Finder and clear it.  Levels were too easy.  Quests almost became pointless.  It was hard to keep up with where I should be because I could run a couple of 5 mans and be past the zone I was in previously.
---
I stopped playing before Mists was announced and then came back right after it launched to see if I could get the love back.  It only took me a few hours to realize that I was simply done w/ the game.  I logged out and only returned a couple of times to start new characters to mess around w/ the early game content but it was mostly pointless.
---
The instant that they announced Classic, I knew I would come back when it launched, which is exactly what I did.  WoW is fun again.  The levels are challenging.  The classes are perfectly imperfect in every way.  Everything *means* something.  I'm not mindlessly grinding levels w/ no fear of dying.  If I want to go to a 5 man dungeon, I have to plan it out and travel there.  Everything I do feels like an accomplishment, whether it's clearing all the quests in Darkshire or completing the Stockades.  I'm excited to be able to do Scarlet Monastery again in the future. I'm looking forward to Scholo and Strat.  It's not just nostalgia for me.  I loved WoW for SO long.  Blizzard *ruined* what I loved about the game.  They made everything feel totally pointless.  
---
This is their second chance...and mine too.
---
If the mage wants to kite some I just won't even bother going after the ones after him until the ones hitting the group are dead.
---
The way I see it is that it's raining free rage.
---
Wowee I'd love to see the comment that resulted in this reply
---
+1 for .net- dev here too in the .net stack.
---
Dwarf is *the* choice for both. Some guilds took would take dwarf priests over other options without looking at anything else. Though now that "knowledge" is more common and there are tons of dwarf priests out there already, it should be easier to get raid spots with any race.
---
The other day I did a quest where I had to kill 5 elder boards in 10 minutes, that was time sensitive.
---
You should start your own dungeon groups and title it as “NO MAGES ALLOWED” youd be surprise the amount of non mages whispering ya lol
---
Still cheaper to not invest into helping the Linux community than doing the opposite.
---
It's a sad truth.
---
what's the performance like compared to running wow on windows?
---
I started playing wow in wotlk. Played very heavily during cata, on and off during legion.
---
Classic is very fun to me even without the nostalgia. 
---
There are only two things i don't like.
---
1. Dishonorable kills need to get in the game quickly. Its super annoying being killed by skull players while leveling when you damn well know you can't do anything about it. Dont get me wrong, i love world pvp, when they are in my level range. But getting killed by a level 45+ rogue when im level 33 is just anti fun. I've heard this will be added soon, so this is just a rant.
---
2. This is my super unpopular opinion: I think dungeon finder would be a great addition to the game. Considering there is no heirloom gear, I don't think it would change the leveling experience all that much. Especially if they added lockouts in lfg, but you could still walk there if you needed to do it again.
---
I know full well I'll get some hate for my 2nd point, but at a certain point it's not about 'making the game easier' its just a giant QOL change.
---
\&gt; Yet I joined every battle I could, and tried to move unseen in the forest and gank every enemy I could surprise, for my beloved Ashenvale.
---
That is funny.
---
Yep, that's the thing. I believe the true "tourists" are going to be primarily the folks who rush to 60 and realize there's not a whole lot to do at lvl 60 once you clear MC. Sure, you've got profession leveling, ganking, and alt-ing but that gets old pretty fast. A vast majority of the game occurs pre-60.
---
When I go to Duskwood it just happens to be always on the road!
---
But I managed to avoid him because an npc patrol got his attention and I sneaked past lol.
---
Yeah just do one Sunder on this it will turn at 50%, let these dps run while you up threat on the 3 other baddies.
---
I've never seen anyone so determined to catch a boat hahahaha
---
why do you want the healer to be less mana efficient?
---
Just updated 
---
    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl 
---
from 64 to 128 (Windows 10 default) after seeing it mentioned in another thread.
---
    sudo service network-manager restart
---
I'm in.
---
You need to kill something like 3 mobs for the Dreadmist peak quest.  If you just approach it from the southeast it is actually the easiest that way.  Went once when all the mobs were dead and had 25 minutes left on my timer.
---
Turns out Blizzard was checking TTL values, which are different between Linux and Windows, probably to try filter out IoT devices.
---
Changing the default TTL value supposedly fixes this.
---
    echo 128 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl
---
You can add `net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=128` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` to make the TTL persist.
---
Can confirm. Road travel is safer than through the woods.
---
49, I feel like I’m so far behind but seeing this I guess I’m not lol.
---
If only I could sacrifice my gf, going to the gym, and job as easy and often as I do my voidwalker, I’d probably be 60 by now
---
31! I was pretty ill for the past few days, so wasn't playing as much. Otherwise I would of been 35-40??
---
I just had to respond to E). I forgot to do both on my first dungeon group, as well as not repairing before departing (I honestly thought durability only decayed if you died!), and running out of arrows. Surprisingly my group were very tolerant of the noob huntard who must have made EVERY DAMN HUNTER MISTAKE YOU CAN THINK OF!!! 🤣
---
All good sound advice anyway! Be a hunter, not a huntard!
---
i do use those too, as im often the solo mage of the group, but im teaming with a friend priest and warrior, priest does a good job with shields to allow me to fully cast blizzards, warrior can play aswell around me, by letting me kite melee, but focusing on problematic ones.
---
If you add a good rogue on top of this all, its just perfect.
---
&gt;In the end we were 5 groups there, 3 alliance and 2 horde groups and we all helped each other. Thanked and hearthstoned out all at once.
---
Absolutely disgusting.
---
I was just scrolling to find the odds-guy. Thanks.
---
Yeah this is definitely an opinion post. I tell them to spam it and I’m the healer. I want max damage and I manage my mana accordingly. More stress is more fun in a dungeon especially if we complete quicker. If I have to manage drink ticks and my first heal hits the tank at 20% and I end up using 2 mana pots in the dungeon due to being to tight on mana that a pat can result in death then I’m having fun. It’s about managing expectations at the start. I tell people to go all in from the start and feel free to chain pull and go all in on dps as long as we break combat just enough to let me drink. I’m on voice with my tank and if he needs to taunt something I mention it. It’s more rewarding for me to skid across the finish line at 20% health and zero mana.
---
The heal tank combo determines the pace in classic when in retail It's really the tank and the DPS's in high end M+.
---
It's never only one guy.
---
Is it just me, or are a lot of healers taking it as an offense when they see me use drain life? :) Usually they just top me off while draining. Like, don't worry dude, I'm healing myself and fishing for Nightfall procs :)
---
No way, we don't want link curve or GTFO in classic.
---
I thought the sitting crit wasn't a thing in classic.
---
At least on warrior forums peoples say that the sitting enrage trick won't work.
---
Chaosh
---
That is honestly the best part about the barrens.  Rather then knowing the 3 level range that everywhere else is okay for you can just go to the barrens until hillsbrad, hillsbrad until STV, and from there we are back on the 2-3 levels per zone train until 60.   Barrens is great.
---
Did you assume his class?
---
One of the reason I cannot play retail. Things get tough you can turn off pvp mode. Sorry that's a big nope from me dawg!
---
In that case you shouldn't play WoW, because you can't use any of it outside of the game.
---
"But it's fun", yeah, so is surviving a gank.
---
Classic is way better imo
---
Touchy subject bro. Just playing the game doesn't make you good. With that theory why doesn't everyone who works full-time own a house by 40?
---
I dont get why this is becoming such a big argument all over wow forums and here. Rogue lockpicking was always a dungeon utility when you are in a dungeon, groups would enjoy bringing a rogue because they can lockpick chests and doors granting extra loot + shortcuts, that was the value they brought.
---
I don't know the actual numbers, but since BT only scales with AP I would assume that it falls behind WW in leveling gear?
---
These posts really have me in stitches
---
&gt; All your progress will be reset with the next expansion anyway. 
---
Gear wise yes but thats how mmorpgs work without new better things you someday wonder why you even play because you have the best gear already.
---
Good that classic grind is so long to not worry about that but once i reached bis gear and have quite a bit of gold i would ask myself what to do then
---
No but I did assume they could use the summoning stone
---
From what I’ve heard, a lot of cannon rushes are being practised there.
---
Why would we do that to ourselves?
---
Did you make much money from these?
---
How did you source the agility elixirs?
---
Don't need more dps with 3 mages. Bear keeping aggor is way better than a fury warrior losing aggro. Ran both for hours already. Druid is far superior at least in these dungeons.
---
100% love pvp servers! It makes everything more interesting! To me it makes the world seem so much more alive because you have a constant REAL threat looming over you. I love questing in A- highlands just to see a random large scale BATTLE over some mobs. Its freaking WORLD OF WARCRAFT!!
---
All leveling is really.
---
Ah I love playing with rolls too. Kaiser, hoagie, bum, you name it!
---
Believe you actually do get mana faster while sitting.  It is just such a small boost it doesn't really matter.
---
You sound kinda butthurt and also you act as if they can't just make another character lol
---
This reminds me of the time way back in 2006 when my dwarf hunter barely, and I mean barely made the jump from the edge of the dock to the boat from Menethil Harbor to Theramore. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to repeat it again.
---
Honestly things just suck while you're doing them, but at most it'll take 20 minutes to farm everything up.
---
so this does show all characters registered by the addon, including twinks,bank chars and so on? 
---
Its does not recognize, that the characters were made by the same account?
---
ME SAY ALONE RAMP
---
Sadly I have 3!
---
At 30, I find myself with Blizzard, Flamestrike, Arcane Explosion, Cone of Cold and Blast Wave.  The AoE options are honestly stunning.  Love it!  I use Blast Wave &gt; CoC &gt; AE a lot in dungeons because everything dies while I'm still channeling Blizzard lol.
---
What does it mean to "cleave" a dungeon?
---
The kid should pay the money for every people working on the ddosing probleme, + the servers shut down time
---
If he can't he go to jail
---
Is that how it works ?
---
Explore the nature.
---
God that's is brilliant.
---
Thing is that as a tank we don't see immediately if you're heal spec'd or Shadow, enhancement, retribution, feral or whatever.
---
If you're bored tell us. I can tell you that if my heal say that he's bored he won't ever be bored again and will most likely raise some damage dealers ^. ^
---
Shhh... they don't like this kind of truth here...
---
As a fellow rogue, I do this with rogues only. Any other class can get fucked, stop tagging my mobs I'm clearly running to!
---
Lol no that’s not even close to how that works
---
It has been a common issue. If you look at the big forums on the blizzard website. A lot of topics have been opened about it.
---
Yeah I don’t understand why everyone in this sub seems to be proud of selling stuff super cheap. Like, if you wanna troll other sellers, sure, so be it, but it’s just that, trolling. So don’t be surprised people are getting annoyed.
---
There's little difference. Most likely you're not even going to lose 5 fps. DXVK has improved the life of Linux gamers so much.
---
However, it depends on your graphics card being able to use Vulkan so you can use DXVK (which allows you to run DirectX games via Vulkan). All modern-ish cards and integrated graphics can do that, you'll only run into issues on older systems. On those you would have to rely on plain old WINE emulation without DXVK, which results in drastic performance downgrades.
---
Ha. Had a level 13 in SW whispering for 1g so he can respec because he “messed up his talents”. All my guildies were mentioning getting whispers from the same guy. I humored him, telling him to go grind and by DM he should be able to afford it and he told me his character was unplayable. Funny stuff.
---
They already did something
---
Song name please.
---
So the real question, who won it? and which guild consumed the other?
---
I just left the under city in retail and it started to rain.. yall are starting to Mandela effect the shit out of everything that's in wow.
---
Hello, Alliance player @skullflame right now.
---
I am sitting in a guild over 100 members.
---
There are much more guilds/alliance players than u think. there are 10.000 vs 26k horde right now.
---
Explain please? I haven’t heard anything and these whispers continue.
---
best. dungeon. ever.
---
PALLYPOWER!
---
OT: does anybody know a good Add-on for Pally Buffs?
---
Yes, it shows all characters, there’s no way to identify if characters belong to the same account.
---
It's again quite a different thing to just block Linux users for no reason at all and blocking Linux users as a quick temporary fix to prevent DDoS attacks.
---
There is no rush and you should really focus on getting that sweet nostalgia tingling. I'm still trying to enter my old elementary school so I can play after my lectures but the police keep showing up saying stuff like "dude u look 30 tf wrong wichu?".
---
What's S/O?
---
When I log in it says the addon has a lot of errors and might slow down game play. I don't notice lag but I do notice my mouse not selecting things sometimes and stuff like that

You save time by not having to go there. Time is money. Really simple concept
---
And a complete burden on the group who carries him.

Seems this experience is on both sides. I, for one, see no value in ganking a solo quester when I’m in a group but if you try to gang-bang me and I come back with friends, be prepared for me to corpse camp you until you spirit res! Dishonourable combat must be suitably punished! 😂

It won't prevent stupid people from whispering, tho
---
Not everyone has to enjoy the same aspects as you. I personally enjoy the endgame over leveling
---
Bud you have serious issues if you think any of us  are clueless while you’re going around spewing this garbage.  You should be embarrassed by your words
---
Need on some more Boe epics just incase!
---
Ok, bud. Have a good one.
---
That’s crazy, man. Have you ever done DMT?
---
Oh you already cleared all? Good job man =)
---
nearly the same on PCs with at least decent hardware
---
i lose arround \~5 FPS
---
 (dual boot have windows and pop!\_os installed)
---
That’s my favorite jump in the game!!
---
You can survive with an epic mount, you’ll land in the water.
---
They just blocked the default TTL as the quickest fix.  It is easy to work around for both players and attackers, so they are definitely working on a better solution. For now this is either no Linux players or no players at all.
---
same :) and I've killed him twice since because I saw horde hunters trying to tame him.  
---
For the alliance!
---
Nooo wayyy someone was mean online! Alert the presses.
---
Undercutting by 5% doesn’t mean putting stuff at vendor price like everyone here seems to be so proud of
---
Even if it's not, there's still the part where the heals them self give more hp than the mana cost
---
I can't really pinpoint one thing and say "do this thing that classic does and your MMO will be better for it", because many of them just seem like bad design decision once you isolate them, however in the environment they exist, all these flawed decisions seem to support each other. I believe that what makes Classic successful compared to modern MMOs is the naivety with which it was designed. Neither Blizzard nor anyone else really knew how design an MMO to retain players with least amount of effort and entry impediments. I also can't point out one thing about BfA that was a deal breaker for, aside from saying that the whole thing felt like a skinner box designed to remove all sources of frustration and inconvenience, aside from those that would get me to log in the next day.
---
Shrug most locks I play with can figure out the amount they can get away with before dying . Unlike retail most fights do not have a bunch of random dmg thrown at dps. As long as dps is not in cleave range or pulling agro they don’t take much damages. With that said as a priest I never break my mp5 to heal a life taping warlock. He/she can wait till I next heal the tank for a heal .
---
It's the current melee DPS meta, where you essentially just bring either 3 or 4 warriors with Sweeping Strikes, Ravager and all that good AoE shit, a healer, and a class that complements them (feral druid, enhancement shaman, etc) and essentially just plow through the dungeon because Ravager is stupidly overpowered.
---
I didn't get a single whisper of that kind and rarely saw something like that in /1
---
&gt; I’m lucky if I can go 10 minutes without getting a whisper. 
---
Sure...
---
Significant other. Wife / Husband etc
---
Level 20 on my main Mage, and level 5 on an alt hunter (it's pseudo banking and disenchanter in IF).
---
I don’t understand why people need to name their characters this way.
---
As a shaman, it's my dps plummets if I don't make sure tank has everything since mobs will literally kill my fire nova totem if they aren't
---
I forgot how many quests there were that sent you to the middle of nowhere in the most random zones. Doing the Shaman quests for my totems was like that, I would get my next quest and it would be telling me to go to Tarren Mill and then the next one sent me to some shrine in Ashenvale.
---
I said "What the hell, this makes no sense, it's going to take forever  to get there and the mobs in that zone will probably kill me over and over again, this is fucking great"
---
confirmed fix
---
Man I don't mind if someone sends a message or whatever afterwards. But not to get onto alts or friends to harass someone.
---
Big McThankies from McSpankies!
---
This sounds like it might get better as these exploiters realise then
---
I think it will be hard now.  I intentionally no-lifed the first few days and was way ahead of the pack just to tame him easily and avoid the madness.  Now i've slowed down and am playing 2-4 hours a day but the first week was 10+
---
A night elf? And a hunter? Man... you know he is a scumbag player.
---
retail bad classic good
---
Honestly. Bidding is pretty useless in this game. Buyouts are the way to go. It may cost a little more. But you guarantee you get the item without having to babysit it.

Hey did your mommy make you feel better about fucking someones life up for 3 years. Mr I do no wrong. Seems odd my credit cards you opened still not paid you still have my phone no deposit back for the house since you knew you were leaving not fair that I get shit taken because you are a immature brat. Btw nice car you got must have been nice asking me to take a day off me losing money I didnt get back by the way just so you could have some new pos cherokee. You could pay the banks you over drafted back too so I can get a bank account open. I can open one with regions but they will take money out of mine to cover yours. But I guess you need someone to fall back on. Sure wish edward Baker could learn to manage his money and act responsibly. But then again if you were responsible youd have a nice car not a base cherokee pos. Wouldn't have banks all over overdrafted wouldn't open credit cards in others names would pay Bill's on time wouldn't half ass shit you do. But keep going how your job is so hard. Drop and hook dude. If your job was so strenuous I dont see you gaining 70 pounds. Oh wait that's right you sit holding a steering wheel for hours. Guess it must be nice to fuck everyone over but your druggie whore mom because she abandoned you as a kid will swoop in to consol you now. Haha it's not even real who is ok with their friend kid parent whatever being a complete and utter dick. Shes just using you to make herself feel better you are too dumb to figure it out. She feels guilty so she says it's ok threespeed. It's ok to commit credit fraud it's ok to ruin someones car it's ok to not pay rent and Bill's and lose everything cause your a idiot. Instead a real parent would tell you to straighten up. No wonder you run to her or grandma they tell you are a good boy and pat you on the head no matter what you did. Cause poor threespeed. Well keep running to them have fun with your whore nikki. Doubt it's a coincidence we start having issues after she shows back up in your life. But hey give her a std too sure that be nice dont tell her you have one either cause being honest is for suckers right.
---
Fair point. Some people are desperate to be toxic, and it just makes them seem like middle school tryhards.
---
As a druid tank I swich out to pop a rejuv on my warlock buddies , after all you give that sweet sweet stamina buff from your pet, its the least I could do :)
---
Might be wrong but I remember "chance on hit" weapons having a PpM (proc per minute) value. Meaning speeding the weapon up doesn't actually give you more procs.

Why do people play chess?

Why did this thread get unpinned when it's only a day old?

Less features, less things, but immensely more rewarding doing or achieving anything in the game. Less convenience, more community.
---
haha okay thats a relief!
---
Nothing too creative. Found a Ally druid in cat form, about half hp running past the ogres in arathi. I threw a distract, turn him into a pack. Seems he was on auto run, because by the time he reacted, it was just too late.
---
Then of course the random sapping of people. No trinkets, no getting out of sap for you for the next 35s. Stunning people in combat, dragging mobs into mage aoe (works with both sides :D) and vanishing.
---
I just wish clothies can stop drinking. Regardless of how many allies are around, I don't care if I die, If I see a clothy sitting, I can't resist it.

This.  If you're not a pvp'er its really not a big deal but in pvp it will help push back casts
---
I asked my buddy what happens when he is in a situation like you described L30-40, he only replied: "I am druid."
---
It hasn’t happened to me on my alliance character on Hydraxian Waterlords, But on Golemagg, on my Horde character it has been happening several times per hour. As the other commenter said though, Looks like blizzard have done something about it. So hopefully as the exploiters realise that it is no longer viable to layer hop, the whispers will cease.
---
I'd tap that
---
People in this sub keep praising the classic community but then we get posts like this one and all those comments on it. Makes me want to stop leveling my warrior. Or leveling anything in classic for that matter.

Hey guys,

Is this talent tree good for single target leveling?
---
I was looking for a good talent tree and I thought this was pretty good? Looking for some confirmation.

To that we agree.

Way to go Blizzard. You totally care about your customers...

Play with your friends. You won't regret it. After they touch you the basics you can still convince th to try out a pvp server. But for the first time it really doesn't matter.

colleague also play with this pen thing... werd af
---
A Molten Core dog with a retrousse nose
---
Or you throw nades+bombs on enemies to avoid repair costs.
---
This sounds like your DPS is shit and doesn't know how the aggro system and rage generation works.
---
Start marking targets with a skull and tell them to focus this one. If they pull aggro anyways just let them have it and tell the healer to let them die. Maybe they learn after a death or two.
---
\#NeverOOM because of my \~170 spirit @ lvl 42 :D

I did put the 5 points into the mana reg talent from the shadow tree too, although it's quite hard to get the finishing hit on mobs when a bunch of angry dds are going for the penismeter crown :P
---
WHAT THE HECK THIS IS WHY I CAN'T LOG IN AND GET WORK DONE NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN?? BLIZZ WTF I WANT TO NOLIFE
---
Sub and tell us your opinion next week (or two..)
---
&gt;but in my eyes are sort of cheating
---
Please just quit the game. I've seen a lot of people saying this total rubbish. Almost always from kids who never even played vanilla... news flash... addons existed weeks after the game did... and lots of people used them just as people use them now.
---
Absolutely not "cheating" and if you don't like them, just don't download them. Have fun getting shouted at by your RL though.
---
Why the fuck did you even do it if you didn’t enjoy It? Classics end game is worth shit at this moment, why even force yourself doing something this useless and unfun?
---
Change to IPv6 or change the default TTL. You will find a copy-paste solution in other comments.
---
....
---
Yeah, I think the problem was that it was competing with WoW when Wow was at its strongest. I don’t remember that part, though you had to commit to your kills... especially the healer classes.

Shortly after becoming a God himself. Like all in this world though nothing last forever and we both know hearts can change. Papa Jeff Kaplan, true God of men, was needed elsewhere. We are the last of his following and crusade to spread the word of Jeff.
---
Kaplan's crusaders is PVE focused guild that plans on raiding semi seriously in classic WoW. We want players who enjoy the group aspect of the game and have fun joking around but still have the desire to actually finish something. We plan to accept any spec for any class for raids and don't really want to enforce requirements spec wise unless it becomes a legitimate problem to completing content (like fire mages in MC). We want people that embrace off-meta strategies. It's classic, enjoy it. No real need to min-max everything just do your best with what you're using.
---
General rules: 
---
Don't be a dick
---
Add-ons are acceptable but will not be required
---
No harassment
---
Discord is required but a mic isn't (unless raid leader)
---
Listen to officer instructions during raids.
---
Come to raids prepared.
---
Any negative comment about Jeff Kaplan results in a insta g-kick. 
---
Raid time: Saturday 3pm-7pm possibly another night as well (likely Friday or Sunday) 
---
Member expectations: 
---
No experience required but be willing to learn and listen.
---
Never purposely troll the raid (Not the tank? Don't pull the boss)
---
No ninja loot
---
Don't expect free loot. It's a group effort
---
Come as prepared.
---
Loot rules: TBD 
---
Officer slots: We are in need of officers
---
Raid leader: Expected to know all fights and lead the group through the raid. The raid leader will have to work within the guild rules (can't require add-ons etc) and the raid is the raid leaders responsibility.
---
Class officers: Expected to know a lot about their class and help the raid leader with any questions they may have as well as having a clear understanding of what's needed from your class each fight and helping the raid leader manage the raid. This includes gear requirements and a class officer should be familiar with BiS and what's required of a class to raid in regards to consumables, gear, etc. That said, specs should remain a personal choice as much as possible. (Yea ban fire mages in MC, but if the choice is something like arms warrior vs fury, leave it to personal choice.)..
---
Mate you for real idm trying it out.
---
Thank you! Seems like its mostly communication
---
Hey, I've been tethering using my 4G mobile plan. Having the exact issue as you're describing but I also tried another 4G plan and it still didn't work. Granted, both those plans use the same provider in the Uk: O2. 
---
I've also tried logging in with a different computer and still doesn't work. Using a different internet connection though, it does work. 
---
So the problem must be related to my mobile network provider I imagine.
---
I found warrior to be a bit harder to keep aggro with than bear ...
---
how do people do these? cant stack 6+ quests without empty bags. addional info: i am a hunter :(
---
With a gtx2080, I'm synced at 100fps (3440x1440) to my monitor refresh rate. I've never seen it dip below this in windows or linux
---
I bet Mor'ladim is right behind you &gt;:]
---
Where/who did it drop from?
---
I think it adds to the experience. there were DDoS attacks in WoW Vanilla why not WoW Classic?
---
I was a sophomore but didn't play until after I graduated in high school. It was July/August when I started to play, my freshman year of college, 2007. 
---
I started when I was 18 and I'm 30 now. LOL
---
unlikely to find anyone with the talent and the skill and the weapon before lvl 25/30, but yes i was referring to shielded shamans :)
---
How is any of this suppose to work? It isn’t you who is getting DDoSed, it’s blizzard servers. There is nothing you can do about it when server is under fire. If power cycling pc or modem ever worked for you then it was pure luck and server went back online in meanwhile. 
---
If there was scenario that some people can connect to &gt;&gt;&gt;particular&lt;&lt;&lt; server but you can not, then changing the network could help. Simpler solution would be to find VPN cross country and use that instead for that matter.
---
Please elaborate what warriors do in this specific scenario?
---
People overreact wpvp so much... People rarely attack each other and instead choose to quest and level in peace 99.9% of the time... I'm at lvl 46 on Flamelash and I was in like 7-8 fights I think... That didn't slow me at all compared to 4 days /played...
---
Fair point! Following you thread I was a bit curious and started googling, seems like the realm is fairly balanced. Not that it makes much of a difference right now. 
---
Still interesting to see!
---
They already did. Thus it is weird.
---
Well, for every story like this, there are countless counterexamples.
---
When I quested in STV, funnily enough, exactly the same quest, I pulled 2 mobs and got attacked by another patrol of 2 as well. An orc shaman was watching this entire time. When I'm at ~200 hp and 1 of the 4 mobs remaining, he frost shocks me.
---
In Tanaris, I went into the hive for Scrimshank Redemption. I meet an undead mage and we take turns pulling mobs and getting through the hive. Before the gear we seek are 3 mobs. I charge in, expecting the mage to help once he finished drinking. Instead he attacks me after I killed two of the mobs forcing a 5min run back into the hive on me.
---
He's around there somewhere
---
Maybe some of these exploiters haven’t realised yet
---
I was tanking for the first time in a dungeon yesterday with my warrior alt. Everytime I got more than two mobs at once the mage threw in a blizzard. I feel like other MMOs including retail have conditioned people into "Three mobs and more = AoE spam time".
---
wheres my 'casual leveling' guilds on golemagg, my options are currently hardcore raiding and pvp guild where ill feel inferior to rest of the people constantly or a complete clownfiesta where youll find 2ppl to do SM with, on a good day at peak.
---
As a Linux user, I want to apologise for that nutjob.
---
I hava fever -- and the only prescription is... shit.. Im OOM. Cant Cure Disease. Yall on your own.
---
In ye olde days I was a pretty friendly guy, /wave'd to hordes and helping if I could..
---
But I would go out of my way to fuck up an ud rogue's day.
---
Oh man, sucks to hear that, i'll update OP with this thanks!
---
Karazhan and caverns of time with Mt hyjal raid could be added without having to add Outland etc. They could add Mt hyjal in the world as well.
---
Also no damned blood elves or space goats please.
---
Then they could do something cool with uldum that wasn't the desert zone. In classic and vanilla the uldum entrance show it to be some underground stuff.
---
It's a lot of extra work for not much return
---
The good news is you are consistent, the bad news is you are wrong on all points.
---
having a feral tank really makes a difference at that boss. I did this dungeon multiple times now, twice as heal, once as feral tank. In my groups as healer I had a warrior and a feral tank. That warrior was raped hard by that boss. After the dungeon he took a shower and cried in fetal position. Healing the feral and tanking him as feral was absolutely no problem at all.
---
Smite spam is a viable way to lvl tho.
---
I don't wanna sound like an asshole but going ret is probably gonna be rather painful experience since many view it as unviable meme spec. I honestly can't speak at all for how accurate that might be, but if you wanna make it easier on yourself try healing since that's what other people look for in a paladin. It's shitty but what are you going to do. I'd like to raid as enhancement but that's not gonna happen either.
---
Just so you know before you make larger time investment on the character
---
Funny that. I've only had engagements with alliance when I'm already low hp from fighting mobs.
---
The mage in this picture started it. Little shit.
---
a gold already?
---
I honestly don't even know what there is to exploit. They don't really gain anything.
---
Arathi highlands top left side fire elementals, but for that amount u need good AH prices xD
---
Moonfire costs absolutely ridiculous mana.
---
I'll use my own 42 druid as an example. Deep feral spec, 1 point in balance for Nature's Grasp, currently getting resto for Furor. Your typical leveling druid will most likely carry a simillar spec, with 5/5 HoTW. 
---
Highest rank of Healing Touch heals for 958-1143 and costs 405 mana.
---
Highest rank of Moonfire costs 235 and does 117-137 instant damage, and 212 over 12 seconds.
---
The most mana efficient spell available, Starfire, costs 230 mana and does 293-348 damage with a 3.5 second cast timer.
---
The reason not to spam spells is to regen with spirit. And I gotta be honest my dude, I value keeping the group moving and balancing my mana accordingly *a lot* higher than nuking a pack and then drinking. It's typically either-or, in a level appropriate dungeon.
---
I knew this guy who was 85 when vanilla launched. So you’re actually pretty young.
---
In my opinion it was probably the best expansion - I think the issue most people have is the "uh pandas" feelings and the 15 months (iirc) of Siege of Orgrimmar.
---
Genuinely had something for everyone.
---
At this point I’ll take it, shit
---
Now take this advice however you want. If you had your guild all right click report him you get him muted and completely fuck him from getting a group. The choice is all yours. You can be the nice guy and ignore, or you can get a strike on his account and get him muted. Ball is in your court.
---
How do you play the AH? I’ve never understood it
---
Tanking and for context I did have a shield
---
Warlocks actually only have 1hp, the rest is just green mana.
---
People who playing classic is old player base, mostly chill people. But everyone is playing for now I guess.
---
Speaking of rewards. I love getting dungeon gear! I can realistically farm a dungeon for a specific piece of gear, like Hypnotic Blade from Library, or the staff and gloves from ZF. I don't have to grind all the other dungeons available to me while hoping that my key turns into a ZF key, then hope that my item drops and that it titanforges a bazillion times. A Hypnotic Blade is a Hypnotic Blade.
---
My guess. It was a Night Elf Hunter and he was exactly what their demographic is. 9.
---
I have never experienced this, nor has anyone I know... do you have some sort of LFG addon or something?
---
I’ve never actually done this but threatened too; when a DPS was pulling mobs ahead of the group, instantly spamming AOE etc. I just said you can tank now since your trying to anyway. The group had my back though and we completed just fine.
---
How did you get the Sinew? Thought Azuregos wasn't released until Phase 2?
---
Just one that will give 0 honor.
---
Someone in the clip needs to repair their armour haha
---
I will be watching this meme templates career with great interest.
---
You thought Ice Block was our best defense!? THINK AGAIN!!!
---
do kids ask you to play classic with them?
---
I don’t use any addons
---
It only shows percentage. No way of seeing the numeric value. There are some addons that do that, but are not 100% accurate.
---
I've had some people quit, because they can't be bothered with classic and it's 'inconveniences'.
---
One players exact reason was the stringy vulture meat in Redridge. Farmed them for an hour and rage quit to never be seen again.
---
Another has rerolled from a 50 mage as he got bored spamming frostbolt and started levelling warrior. Now he barely logs on which I think is due to attrition.
---
Me on the other hand is absolutely having a fantastic time. So life moves on.
---
Mounts and flying mounts ruined the world.

I like how portals, lfg and other shortcuts ruined WoW's sense of community and exploration but on the other hand everyone appears to hate it.

“Trying to raze Ashenvale” is a but too strong of wording. Ashenvale is the closest source of lumber to the Horde capital of Orgrimmar which is why the lumber mills there are vital to the Horde’s survival. It just so happens to be a sacred forest to the Night Elves.
---
In WC3, when the Warsong Clan first arrived in Kalimdor and tried to harvest lumber from Ashenvale, the Night Elves attacked them without explanation. Push came to shove and long story short, Grom killed the Night Elves’ demigod Cenarius which basically led to a never ending war between the races.
---
After reading this thread I’m fairly confident that none of the posters have played a rogue at cap.
---
After seeing posts like this I feel so lucky, about 80% of the time people are nice and talkative (is that even a word?) in retail aswell in classic. Thought it was because I was WAY overgeared for the content so logged on a hunter and made it a mission to get kicked, ninjapulled and everything, even caused a few group wipes here and there. What was I met with?   
---
Helpful tips and understanding comments, people must think I'm a girl or something xD
---
I have been playing WoW from 2006. At WotLK I first time got into end game and raiding scene. In every expansion I have played game at least on casual level (some expansion I just haven't had time/interest to raid). Also I have been GM of our guild which has been more or less operational since MoP. And yeah even BfA has flaws I have still been playing and raiding.
---
Up to this point. Currently I have no interest to play retail. I know I will return there some day but now I am all in Classic. This is just way better version of WoW.
---
/who searches are not layer restricted.

---
Any good?:
---
\-Actually plays Classic the way it's supposed to be played
---
\-Chillest voice there is out there
---
\-Strong opinions about how WoW after WOTLK is actual trash but Classic is the best version ever. Doesn't rub it in your face that much though
---
\-Quality stream, best streaming layout there is out there
---
\-Good music (from Jazz to Hip Hop)
---
I've played WoW since around 2004/05. I quit about 5 months after BFA launch and I genuinely don't remember a single interaction with another player during BFA. I had very few during legion as well. The only way you're going to get human interaction in retail is if you're in an active guild. 
---
I can't speak for anyone but myself but honestly, the general consensus seems to be that there's a lack of any sense of community in retail.
---
Well unfortunately that isn't always the case. Sometimes I don't even have a group AoE capable.
---
Most of the time I can't even get a tank to pull from one pack to another without like a half minute pause for no adequately explained reason.
---
What an edgelord you are, how was the newest my chemical romance album?
---
I did feel bad for a second but I hate horde hunters :)
---
Whats the highest lvl of mining you need to be to get to 150 engi?
---
Not going to lie, Classic has brought back that old MMO feeling. You have to work with people, you have to be part of the community. It's the best. I thought I grew out of MMOs - it turns out MMOs just haven't been the same.
---
Frost.
---
All I'm getting so far is people that zerg me 3v1 while I'm fighting mobs and then /spit. Haven't seen any even PVP for like 20 levels now.
---
Maybe a dumb question, but how did you manage to remove retail without removing classic?
---
I played BfA for two months and had plenty ... but I am not shying away from starting communication myself. Nothing prevents you from doing that.
---
&gt;I can't speak for anyone but myself but honestly, the general consensus seems to be that there's a lack of any sense of community in retail.
---
Yes, that is true. I think this is mostly the case because of cross servers and piss easy content, tho.
---
Am lvl 19 and just finished my first DM run in 15 years. 
---
For me its the jurney which is the whole experience
---
Didn't for me
---
Proper lifetap is crucial to maximise dps in dungeons and raids. I allways bring both food and water and after fights i dont expect anything but a renew. But IN fights there is many situations that require lets say a hellfire and i WILL tap down to 30% if need be to get it off and save the pull. In those situations i will require healing. Ive played a healer on private servers and i never get the complains, healing a lock who lifetaps properly is just effiency and more dps outout. A healer heals, it is your job to heal. Do you not heal when a fury warrior uses bloodfury and takes more damage cause its HIS fault or do you appreciate the extra dps and throw him some extra heals? Outside combat every lock and player generally should bring food and water, but if a warlock lifetaps to get shit done quicker and the healer has mana and the situation under controll you better heal.  And not to be salty but if you actually shield a tank in classic you are in no position to complain about something you clearly cannot comprehend.
---
I don't think I'm missing the point. If we had to say what lawbringer was best for out of healing, dps and tanking, I would say healing. Whether or not it's better than other pieces of gear is something different and not being debated here.

---
Endgame in Classic is what you make of it. I guess you could say the same for retail but honestly, it's a lot easier to enjoy yourself when the community is there and happy to interact. People talk and trade and go on adventures together all the time in Classic. Kite Kazzahk to the enemy faction capital, raid enemy capital, murder guards in booty bay to increase your blood sail rep and earn a title. I mean those are just a few things off the top of my head but when you include an aspect of community, the possibilities are endless.
---
ahh yes... out of those 8 fights i mentioned probably like 6 were in stv :D
---
On Bloodsail?
---
I love the new one, saw con.
---
It's cool, people are also low key retarded. I ripped off the name Damaroth from unreal tournament and people in WoTLK called me Damaru in vent, because you know, words are hard.
---
By the limitation of the API this is not possible. You can't get the position of an enemy.
---
I'm all for Classic+, however, I think that would also need to include class reviews *(not necessarily balancing)*
---
Oh and it would also need to include a Bard profession!
---
"Sorry I'm killing panthers for a quest"
---
I'd be interested in this too.
---
I play horde on the server. And I see the alliance skum everywhere. Don't get why ppl are so "scared" to change...

Bloodspill is not always the best way. In the words of a wise, green non-Orc: “Anger… fear… aggression. The dark side are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”
---
What map add on is that?
---
It’s 50/50 you either get it or you don’t
---
What if I told you warriors can tank with a 2h in defensive stance while leveling?
---
Mostly. Your armour alone is enough against mobs around your level in a dungeon, and the added damage from a 2h both helps with damage and therefore threat. And it helps clear the place faster.
---
You definitely want a shield though to quickly switch to it for shield bash, block and wall where applicable. Usually against casters and when a lot of mobs get pulled and you need to hunker down and use challenging shout. But if you pull properly that's rarely needed. I've ranked most dungeons without needing to change to a shield and the healer has enough mana and time to spare some extra DPS as well.
---
Wotlk Dalaran was really small.
---
reddit, the vocal minority in an echo chamber of validation. they arent mutually exclusive. still raiding retail, still leveling classic. its all good. both games have good and bad bits.
---
As long as it's a standard emote yes, just not the /me ones. All typed text gets transformed into gibberish (which can sometimes be used to your advantage, look up alliance&lt;-&gt;horde translators).
---
Never being more happy with old Azeroth
---
Believe me I tried to communicate with people during M+ runs and even while just leveling... nobody is interested. 
---
And the fact that xrealm and easy content are the reason for the lack of community is kinda irrelevant. The fact still remains that it has a detrimental effect on the community.
---
We used to get some guildies together and go there for a lvl 40 mount jump.
---
Thats why it should be stated beforehand.
---
Sweet.
---
I’m not sure if I’m living in a wacky alternative universe. But this is a really easy video game, and you should be able to play it any way you want without people back seat min maxing you
---
Doubt. Too full of classic memes.

need a little higher level for mage to truly shine. shatter + ice block + ice barrier + cold snap are OP and let you burst down just about anyone

Worked for me on Manjaro with Lutris. Updated the value, followed by a

instead of the sudo service one.
---
The idiot osrs community allowed it to be turned into eoc
---
Nice view of Desolace
---
It still wouldn't be hard. Yes, there were class buffs. However, people like to conveniently leave out that there were also nerfs (reduced caster crit damage, AP normalization, certain OP items were nerfed etc). MC would be a bit harder, but it would still be easily puggable.
---
What about shift into cat form for a few seconds then?
---
I'm giving my druid friend shit for standing around when no one needs healing lol.
---
Oh right i didn't check what the other Thread was and kind of just assumed it was some General Information/PSA/Mod Mail Thread
---
I’ve grouped up with so many people for quests and I haven’t even got to the Deadmines yet. The community is great. Everyone I’ve met is friendly.
---
99%chance of it being script kiddies with mommies credit card for a bot net
---
LFG was great a great adittion solving a growing problem to people leveling up.  
---
The people leveling got stretched out from 1-60 to 1-80, and with many players starting to get Heirloom gear they'd zoom trough the leveling much faster.  
---
This resulted in less people being available to do dungeons at any given level bracket and with many zooming trough them fast enough not to want multiple runs because of their heirloom gear xp bonus.    
---
Oh and the gear would also be less intrested in running the dungeons.  
---
But it also completly destroyed the need to find groups at max level and once they made it cross realm it was over and done with any reason to be social in dungeons.
---
Never heard but gonna check them out!

I literally never heard of that in any priest guide ever. I also haven't levelled a warrior so I don't know that bubbles stop that.

And yeah I'm level 30, still leveling, never said I'm a priest expert. I didn't play priest in vanilla. But I do know how my mana regen works, which is the point of my post. My post isn't about rage generation.

wtf is this ridiculous elitism? How am I supposed to know something that I literally can't know unless I'm a different class or someone happens to tell me?

Facts
---
I had this happen to me a lot one day when I was selling Robes of Arcana for 6g. It was cheap compared to AH prices at the time. But boy did people get angry at me for selling it at that price. When I told them to just not buy it and stop writing me, some got toxic. So I just put them on my ignore. Then they proceed to do as posted above. Eventually a guild member did this and started ranting in the guild chat. It became such a drama that the GM was PMing me asking what was going on. He sided with me, probably because I was very calm about it. 
---
I did sell 10 for 6g per piece.. Only costed me a shit ton of hate xD
---
That's cool, but the one on the right made my sides orbit into Westfall.
---
Actually people are. They blackmail sites and tell them they’ll stop if they pay up, and yes some sites do.
---
that is great
---
You can mine a small spot and change the layer via invite and farm that spot again. I did that thing in suramar on retail in a small cave. Every invite got me some ores without walking around
---
Same thing with AOE farms, you don't have to wait for new spawns if you are able to switch the layer. Really nice for mages
---
Oddly enough, every single vendor in Azeroth will pay exactly 2 silver for it. But that's only for stacks of five of this dude's jaw. A single one is only worth 40 copper.
---
# Ænæs
---
Sounds like you really messed up.
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes
---
3. Don't play alone. You're less likely to be targeted if you are in a group.
---
Are you doing easy shit like +1-3s? I always had communication past 8s, or even lower at the very beginning of BFA
---
Can you still vanish fall damage in this patch? I know back in vanilla on rogue I'd always just jump off freewind post and vanish the fall.
---
Day 10: Starting to wonder if there's some kind of mind controlling subliminal messaging going on within the game... Can't stop thinking about anything Classic related. Dreaming of logging in the next day and falling asleep to the log in screen music. 
---
This shit is like heroine. Considering quitting my job and abandoning family to go hardcore. 
---
In all seriousness though, it is really tough to control the amount of time invested lol.
---
0/10 they replied in the wrong order
---
Poopsock and friends to level them while they were asleep.
---
1-20 its no difference so if u dont plan to play further than that Quit the game
---
Same, my guild used to raid through ashenvale and that jump was our award
---
Interesting.
---
Separately, there's a different fix - changing IP ttl from 64 to 128.
---
It's much easier to hit up groups for the 17-32 level range - mainly Deadmines through to Gnomer and early SM. Anything past that, there just isn't the population yet. Most who transferred were level 15-25. The rest are rerolls who are moving their way up.
---
Primetime searches revealed a high of 800 Ally last night, to a high of just under 1200 for Horde. That pop is doubled from Friday's scans. Take that as you will.
---
I agree that if the numbers stagnate at the population it's at now, the server won't be able to sustain all levels of content. I wouldn't mind if 2 or all 3 new servers got rolled into Earthfury so we can grow from Medium.
---
Druids are healers. Of course you can have fun levelling as bear, but don’t expect things to get better at higher levels. You would  probably have to find nice people that accept the downsides of your abilities as tank to not be toxic. I tried to be feral in vanilla and just got discouraged because it just does not work right in a high level dungeon or raid setting.
---
Yeah it's pointless. Most posts and responses are. Just like yours :)
---
Indeed. Seen a group zerging one or two Horde players turning in quests at the camp a couple of times.
---
You are a disgrace to the Horde.
---
People that were 18 in vanilla are only 30 now
---
You would enjoy Silverpine Forest :]
---
Yea I always try to tell the healer don't should heal me unless chaos breaks out but my friend who plays a lot of healers means it's a healer reflex and it's hard to ignore super low life bars all the time.

46 int on retail? My cataclysm 2h weapon on retail has 25 Str and that's 3 expansions in. It never ceases to amaze me, what they did to the game.

I was playing the goblin healer class, as I remember. It really missed being satisfying for me!
---
I would really like the public quest type in WoW classic's world from Warhammer. Like the ones in Rift and such. Warhammer's public quests always felt so epic, though unfortunately not complete-able, it seemed to me, as soon as people weren't around in the same zone.
---
Stockades are actually amazing with 4 mages 1 healer. Each mage takes one room, you meet at middle, nova there and aoe it down. But the drops are meh, that's for sure.
---
That's true and their abilities are also melee oriented. It's still crazy that a priest can out dps a warrior in the early levels without casting a single spell.
---

Because my brain I severly fucked I recognized that over and over again I cant play a gain for the sake of playing the game. I Need to be the top  1% an dedicate my whole life into the game just to get frustrated and quit 2 months after ( at max ) so I can wait for the next game or server to start and do the whole thing all over again. I should see I shrink I guess.

Unfortunately this won't really help against a DDOS.

There is a simplicity to Classic’s graphics. They do more with less. Things are less overdesigned - e.g. Silverpine Forest.
---
I get that friend. I am doing the same. However buying greens that arent that good- for use, when you will out-level it pretty fast is a bad approach- its good for me but bad for the player...but then again..if the player who is buying the greens is getting a value out of it mentally and in game..I guess its safe to say: Who am I to question the value add and decision making of other players.   
---
You answer made me thing a bit..thank you for that!

I ask for only two seconds of threat building before DPS starts mauling random targets in complete denial that a calculated target marking system is in place, but what do they do? They attack my ranged pulls two seconds before the shit gets to me, giving me 4 less seconds than I need to build threat before they flail around for the next minute OOMing the healer before doing it all over again.
---
Our hunter confirmed the book had a 2 hour trade window.
---
Guess the guy didn’t like the hunter or had ulterior motives, lol.
---
Hmm I see. What do you think about shamans?
---
You sound mad.
---
I give a pass in DM on people learning their threat levels, starting in Stock I whisper the healer to let them die after the third warning. My conse will keep agro off the healer so I just keep it under the hunter and otherwise ignore trying to snap agro back. You pull it, you tank it.
---
You do realise that you've just compromised this hiding spot?
---
When I played Vanilla Retail I kept creating new characters, because everytime I saw other players do cool stuff with their class I was convinced it would be more fun than the class I was playing. I regret that course of action a lot. 
---
I understand the idea of leveling 2 characters, but personally I don't think it will work out that well. You'll be doing the same quests twice in a short period of time, you'll mess up keybinds and mechanics, progress might even feel slower. 
---
Maybe you could "distract" yourself with professions? Take a break from questing and instead work on your professions. 
---
I get a lot of satisfaction from working towards one "perfect character" (fully skilled in professions and weapons, getting Exalted reputations etc). I would get a lot more satisfaction out of that than having several level 60 characters
---
I dunno, people can talk about streamers to watch etc

My alliance guild has a system where if a guild member is attacked by a horde it’s a CODE RED and we are to avenge him by killing at least one horde member within an hour of the attack.

However if a horde helps you like the one in this post, it’s a CODE RAINBOW nullifying the CODE RED.

I've only been playing 12 days but I am having so much fun. My server community is chatty, engaging and helpful. I haven't joined a guild yet, but I have several new friends added who I've met through grouping up (and not just dungeons either!) and crafting items for. 
---
The chat channels are full of conversations! Not just LFG and trade spam. People actually talking to each other! And not just about the game! I cant recall the last time I saw a starter zone in a game look this way.
---
 It's like I just stepped out of the TARDIS back into 2004. This game is fun for me again. I haven't been able able to say any of this about retail since the Lich King days. 
---
Sure it's not perfect. That's why things were altered over time. But as time moved on so did the demands of an ever-changing playerbase. Bigger, better, faster, more! Less hassle, less travelling, cheaper, easier, less grindier....
---
Better though?
---
What did that dev say in that now infamous Q &amp; A video?
---
"You think you want it but you don't." 
---
Well that's very true to a certain extent. The travelling is annoying and the grind... oh my God the GRIND! But right now the majority of us don't care. If and when we grow tired of it retail with all its QoL training wheels is still there. But I don't think I'll bother. Thanks!
---
Really? I main rogue, and I see vanish as a last resort (esp. since it now costs resources), after evasion + tea + hpot failed and running away isn't an option. I'll die with it up just because I don't want to waste it.  
---
If I have to use it while someone's helping me, I'll just regen energy and cheap shot back in, maybe throw in a bandage too if I'm really low. I just don't see why you'd just leave the one saving you to die.
---
I use neatplates.  Pretty much same thing.
---
Dungeon leveling actually puts me to sleep... I could grind and quest all day long but I tried to get in on the aoe grinding in sm and by run 3 I legit was falling asleep in my chair

What?

Thanks! Although you haven't mentioned the dungeon, I think I got it. lol
---
You use your DoTs, throw voidwalker in and wand attack, once soul tape is talented you can use some spells like shadowbolt and use soul tape to get boosted mana regen when mob dies

oh ok

I didn't say rolling another character for DM farming (that was only mentioned in regards to holy nova), but rather in general - if you want to have a good farming option and don't want to respec back and forth, then rolling another class (cough mage cough) is better in the long run. Trying to farm mobs for gold as holy is generally a waste of time, I'd rather sit on the auction house.
---
Waaait, that looks suspiciously like 10 graphics, not classic 3.
---
I notice it has a voting system but doesn't seem to be sorted.
---
Similar to I think the ability to sort by top and sort by new could be nice to get rid of the spam of people posting basic macros when engineered ones exist.
---
it takes like 15 seconds to kill a single mob and then you're oom and have to tap but then you need hp so you gotta drain life which makes mobs die in 30 seconds.
---
meanwhile mages chunk mobs hp like 50% in a single frostbolt and move on to the next one

How do you zoom out that much?

Idk I think your average player is going to hit 60 in 12-14 days /played, playing 20 hours a week that’s almost 4 months of game time. I don’t think people necessarily remember how much time this game takes, or how long it’s going to take your average player to level compared to the speed levelers you’ve been watching on twitch
---
it goes both ways, though. Let the healer reg mana but also don't stand there doing nothing while the healer is drinking. The healer doesn't have to be at 100% when you pull. Drinking doesn't stop when the fight starts.
---
Thank u, I didnt realise u could uninstall one without the other

The quest where you go to kill Troggs outside a cave, and then you go *inside* to kill slightly different Troggs, and then after that turn and you have to go back to the same cave and kill more Troggs further back in the cave nearly killed me until I found out that my level 16 Mage quest was to go back in that same fucking cave.

Congrats man, good choice on server btw, recognise the guild name!

right...they were a mage and i was a priest lol it wasn’t like they were a melee actively running to attack it...we both happened to target and cast at the same mob and he got mad as hell cuz i fucking hit it first i guess

Your ideas are great in theory, yet it won't work. They tried capturable fortresses in tbc i think. There is the thing called faction imbalance. Some servers became alliance favored some horde. It happened in the past and the past ll repeat. Instanced pvp is, how they solved that issue.
---
You have to treat everyone like a potential fight, until youre safe. You dont have to be the first to hit, but you always have to be ready to swing back
---
That's not right it's conpletely situational. I regulary compare my dps with immolate +corruption + CoA + wand vs immolate + corruption + CoA + shadow bolt. Shadow bolt is 3-5 dps higher so far on lv 24

Everyone waiting to move until everyone else has moved. Just move and it will eventually fill up. It is not dead but there is room for more.

Play whatever version of the game you find more fun.

I'm playing Balance Druid (dumb idea, I know) and I've reached the phase in leveling right now where I'm extremely struggling with mana and a large portion of my time is either drinking or simply waiting for my mana to regen. My problem with buffing people isn't only that it costs mana, it also interrupts my own mana regen for five seconds afterwards, which is really annoying. I still buff Warriors and Priests that are leveling solo because they really need it, but not other classes unless I'm just running around with full mana.
---
Cant make people play the way you want
---
Will do thanks !
---
The option is plays what you want to play? You pay monthly you can do whatever you want. If you want to help out your mates in retail do it. If you want to level in classic do it. No need to overthink everything xD

Thousand needles looks great too, but ONLY at night, with a full moon.

It started in The Park in Stormwind. An RP-PVP event on Grobbulus a few days after launch honoring the fallen of the Second War turned from a solemn procession into a patriotic frenzy. Hundreds of people ran (nobody had mounts yet) from Stormwind, through Elwynn, across Duskwood, and through Stranglethorn. Everyone collectively defended the lower levels from the apes and raptors of the jungle, but we lost a few men along the way. Once we got to the docks, some people couldn't help but attack an unsuspecting Darkspear waiting for the ship. The Goblin guards cracked several skulls before people realized they shouldn't cause such a ruckus.  
---
A low level Tauren waiting patiently for a ship in Ratchet was greeted by several hundred alliance pouring out from the ship screaming and casting spells. Everybody charged the crossroads in an enormous unorganized mob. Despite superior numbers, the Horde Guards at the Crossroads sliced through our ranks like a knife through warm butter. A brave Dwarf hunter held his ground somewhat but he too was cut down. We all retreated en masse back to Ratchet. Along the road, I had a funny feeling I was being followed.   
---
Our attack was beaten soundly that day, but, we easily defended Goldshire from a Horde counterattack!
---
Doesn't sound too bad. What's the recipe like, 5 bolts a bag and 5 cloth a bolt?
---
fuck sign me up
---
Yeah you just gotta read both extremes. Double the content at least!
---
That's why you don't/won't have a mount at 40.
---
&gt; meanwhile mages chunk mobs hp like 50% in a single frostbolt and move on to the next one
---
Yeah... no, unfortunately. I mean it starts being kinda true once you have 10 points in Ice shards and Shatter but even then you have 50%+base crit chance which means you're not really critiking consistantly like in retail.
---
Hi, thanks for your comment.
---
I'm sorry you believe this is fictitious, it's not my intention to spread any sort of 'classic good/retail bad' propaganda. I actually really enjoy retail, the action elements and instant gratification gives me a real buzz and it's got much more pick up and play appeal than classic.
---
You and the other cynics are absolutely right, perhaps I did something to offend the group? I've played Ret most of my wow career, so my more recent change to holy has been somewhat wonky- there is every chance I was doing something incorrectly.
---
I hope the perceived attack on retail didn't hurt you personally.

Cheers.

Hello, I'm a very new player. Never touched WoW in any form or version. The reason I'm joining now (trial version, for now) is that I really miss the mmo feeling and I thought that WoW Classic was the one I ought to try someday. I'm looking for new friends to play with, especially in the evenings and nights, and maybe join a guild in the future if all goes well. 
---
My irl friends sadly don't wanto to try because of paying, so I'm left alone here and I said "why not try to make some friends in a different and new environment?"
---
I have no idea about the game yet, so If anyone is down to have a noob friend, I'm here and please be patient :^)
---
Play what you enjoy, it's a video game guild.
---
EA and SF are the only signficant pvp racials ally have, and for PvE you should always roll human for melee. This means mostly only casters have access to decent pvp racials
---
Stun resist is amazing, especially on warrs where it can stack with Iron Will to give you 45% chance to resist stuns. Orcs are also go to melee dps' so you find a lot of orc warrs and rogues. Then there is wotf which is THE premier pvp racial.

Let the loot parade begin

There he is, the hero to your call. The man that opens to the door to Fear's knocking hand and convinces it that Courage is the only option. He maybe only half through his journey, but he wears his factions colours with pride. Charge in and ask questions later he says. Theres no honour in running he says. There might be 6 players circling his comrade, but all he sees is the Blue and Yellow of his home and his family. There's no time to get Well Fed now, for he heeding his call.

&gt;I sort of think the whole reason Blizzard finally launched Classic was to make people shut up about it since it was constantly brought up.
---
That's not how companies work my man. They only care about $$, and when their market research team figured out that it'd be possible for them to run Classic without completely cannibalizing retail (= make money overall), they went for it.
---
Too long, did not read.

---
Not sure what would make you say that? I have been leveling almost exclusively in dungeons, and in the groups where the dps are not pulling threat, lifetaping and not healing, or standing in mechanics, the tank can basically chain pull through the dungeon. When the dps does not do their job well they get to sit and watch me drink more slowing everyone down. I don’t have to “work hard” for us to do efficient runs which is what I am more concerned with.
---
Looks like elvui
---
out of the MMOs i played, the only ones that really compared to WoW were runescape and age of conan - because being out and about in the world actually came with consequences.  Especially in runescape where dying generally meant you would lose a lot of stuff.  the RS quests were also on a whole other level since they were fewer in number and much more hand crafted
---
AoC was pretty similar to WoW but just had a bit more of a brutal nature at times.  I loved it, but unfortunately it ran out of content before u got to max level
---
Warhammer online was a lot of fun but it felt very outdated by the time it arrived

What addons are you running? I like the energy and health set up and would like to do it myself!
---
I did a lot of SM runs when I was in the level range for it, I've got a couple of reasons for that:
---
- I wanted about 6 items from SM.
---
- My warrior gets beat up pretty badly and chews through bandages and food while solo.
---
- My friends or guildmates invited me along and it's nice to hang out with them.
---
- Many of the quests I had were higher level than me and it was nice to grind out some experience to make them easier.
---
- Also meant I didn't need to mob grind much at all.
---
Lol yeah some people really don't get it.
---
My group almost kicked a mage because he wouldnt polymorph the marked target.  
---
They just didnt realized the mage can not polymorph an elemental...
---
I did get kicked from WC the other day because I didnt sap some raptor even though I made it clear it doesnt work on humanoids.
---
They also tend to forget sap doesnt work in combat and they bitch about that too.
---
Some people just lack knowledge about other classes and spells
---
Most people dont do the mallet quest because they dont need to. You outlevel gear quickly.
---
Just kinda odd that literally NO ONE in the entire thread has experienced this lol.
---
We all make mistakes right? I only just found out there’s an auto walk feature after about a day play time... :-)
---
That is more an issue with your tank under pulling/pulling too slowly than anything else.
---
So should I swap for a build that has shatter? 
---
Is there no "best" all in one or build mostly everyone follows? It's going to cost 5 gold to reset talents which is very pricey so I can't afford to make mistakes.
---
I usually open with blizzard as cone of cold requires me to be literally ontop of the enemy for it to hit.
---
I haven't used arcane explosion at all, I can't find a key to put it on that I can reliably reach and use during combat. 
---
I try to drink after every fight but usually my team will run off without me so I have to stop drinking to keep up or they'll pull when I have 50% mana. How do I tell when a tank has enough aggro?
---
Do you think I should swap my build or continue with it?
---
Murphy’s Law states this would only ever happen when they have 1 light feather.
---
What are these even for? I've got the 19 taking up space in the bank b/c I'm worried if I sell it I'll have to spend 4 hours fishing for a new one once I figure it out.

You’re honestly lying to yourself now

&lt;The Struggle Bus&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual 
---
**Overview:**
---
The Struggle Bus was born out of a love for MMOs and community. Currently a FC under a different name on FFXIV, we have formed a guild for casual players that may want to eventually get into raiding. We are a no drama guild (Then again which guild says they have drama). 
---
The ultimate goal is to be a community that helps each other (or just sit in guild chat and make snarky comments, I am a guild leader, not a cop) and hopefully get into 40 man raids. Consider us if you want a friendly environment (Which guild honestly says hostile environment?) and have people to run dungeons with that won't tell you to reroll because you are trying your best as a elemental shaman. 
---
The Struggle Bus! Where we all come to laugh and cry over our dead dreams from 2004. 
---
**Raid &amp; Dungeon Times**
---
Currently under work, we have a few people on of various levels at night. I was a former raid leader of a progression guild on Khadgar back in the day so it is my hope to once again take people through 40 man content. I also raid lead in FFXIV. 
---
**Rules &amp; Player expectations**
---
Just be respectful. Most of us are older players but will gladly accept anyone that wishes to be part of a growing community. The only expectation is to be friendly and that is all! 
---
**Contact:**
---
Feel free to add me on Discord Yngve#8327 or contact me in game in the evening Dorìan. The Struggle Bus is real as I forgot to make people officers.
---
alliance here.  Horde on firemawEU seem to only play in groups of 3-5, questing on mobs that are like 8 levels below them.  everywhere I go we seem very outnumbered and out-leveled!
---
If you think this is a nonissue just leave the thread alone
---
Herod had 50+ in all these zones.  Yes, it's early - sometimes I play early though.

And once you finally get onto a ship to get out of the rain and spend a cozy trip below deck you realize the whole fucking ship is somehow not rainproof and it just rains through the deck.

Yeah always plan the shortened version of your name in advance. And, always imagine your are a complete moron with no knowledge of literature looking at your name haha.
---
Nope.  Have not even logged in.  Not even thought about logging in.  I’m creating a new ‘life’ in classic on my picked server and with my new guild.  Pretty much averaging a level a day so I’m making steady progress and loving it. (Even if I do look like Rincewind tribute act).

No. I'm asking that since it doesn't work, are there any other tricks that do?

That looks amazing!

Stoneform is low key the best pvp racial in the game.

Not a rogue but I saw 2 horde on the final wave of the Gorilla fang quest in STV and as it came in I killed them both and stole the heart Item.

If I remember correctly during my achievement completion phase about 10 years ago, you fish in them and you will get a crate every time.

I'm assuming you can make bank from the crates since they posted this brag thread.

As a Spaniard I knew he was Spanish (or south American) when I read "guatafac", which is comedu slang for WTF.

Also, while Spaniards do need our own server for social purposes, we are, at the very least, able to have a simple conversation in plain English.
---
I suspect a teenager with low school grades or, most probably, soft drugs/booze usage. Or both.
---
People like this are everywhere, I just feel sorry for them.
---
Where is this "list of tracked buffs" configured?
---
Also, if your tank is slightly underleveled, don't try and pressure him into pulling more while he's telling you that, since he's underleveled, things can turn to shit real fast with a row of unlucky misses/parries/dodgs etc. All you're doing is making yourself unpopular, and you want to be popular with tanks.

I'm obviously aware of that.
---
Entirely depends on how you play.
---
The Dots are really mana-efficient but take a long time to actually unfold their damage.
---
But you can use that time to spend time outside fo the 5-second rule.
---
So if you play it more like a priest and less like a mage, you'll have very little downtime. If you want to nuke down your enemies ASAP, you'll have a lot of them.
---
So what priests do is called frontloading. You cast all your spells early on and then just wand for the rest of a fight. You just do it in reverse order for the Warlock because you'll want your pet to keep aggro as long as possible. You might even choose not to use all of your dots to increase the chance of your pet keeping aggro at the expense of killtime but for giving you more time to reg mana and losing less HP yourself.
---
Also between fights try to balance out your mana and your HP with life-tap. You have a buff that generates HP passively. So having full HP is a waste of the passive regeneration. Essentially both your health- and mana-regeneration flow into your mana.
---
Take the energy you just put in the post to find a bette guild.

Problem solved.

Finally Yoda.

Sorry man. Same story for me. Cat made it from vanilla launch to 2 week short of Classic

Unless you're Cloth maybe, Plate on the other hand...

Gonna defecate into a brown paper bag set it on fire on his porch. DON'T LET ME FIND YOUUUU!
---
Thank you for this detailed answer! It seems like you have your shit together could I pm you for further tips ?
---
There are no kids playing this lol. Have you tried showing this to a kid now days? They laugh at you and at the game. Omg its soooo ugly bleah :)

 Only bitter adults :)

I won my Ravager with roll of 3. Because the other warrior in group miss-clicked and greeded.

actually gives 50% with iron will - everyone has a base 5% resist chance for stuns (so basic orc has 30% total stun resist, not 25%).
---
Glad you realized it's your fault and deleted your post.
---
I don't know what I'm supposed to see
---
Is this rain just a filter ontop of the image? Des retail have no "3D" rain with impacts on the surface?
---
So your first toxic experience in classic was ... you being toxic?
---
Nowhere good really, there aren't a ton of contested areas where you'll find lvl 15 alliance.
---
Redridge would probably the closest, but that's more level 18-22.
---
Scariest image ever
---
Hey mate, I'm familiar with the differences between being a fan and worship, I'm worried you aren't. For example, coming into this already passed thread to defend this streamer, calling him awesome and generating a perverse sense of happiness when you see other "haters" is streamer worship and borderline sociopathic. I'm glad you found someone that entertains you, being a fan means you can enjoy this person and share your enjoyment with others. Stepping into a thread and blindly defending is worshipping.
---
Hope you find more to life than this.
---
I hate when I have these dreams, falling for so long only to internally scream when you are about to hit the ground.
---
&gt;but the expected answer to a ddos attack from a multi billion dollars company is to just buy more bandwidth instead of fucking customers so all in all i'd say it's legitimate.
---
Really? I wouldn't have expect any company to try and consistently run on enough bandwidth to combat DDoS attacks over temporarily blocking a unsupported platform.

I would not say that current MMO's are dead. They are different and catering to a different audience. And that is fine in my book. I don't get why people scream for that "one MMO, that rules them all" because this will never really exist. You have people more interested into world PvP while others hate it. Some like raiding, others have already enough to do with Dungeons. Some like to spend hours every day to play a game, others only a couple of hours per week. It's really not that black or white.
---
There are people who will not enjoy Classic. And the reasons for that can be pretty much anything. The only signal this "experiment" should send to the industry is, that some people don't like to have the game holding your hand constantly. If Classic should be a success on the long run, we might see way more MMO's in the future that follow design choices that were more prominent 10 to 15 years ago. Instead of Theme Park MMO X that plays exactly the same as everything else, only with a different graphical design.

bro its a game lmaooo

Hm.. the last Paladin I encountered during questing ninjalooted my chest while i was fighting.

Not safe for orc

Just charge for heals. Mildly wounded 20c, 50% and less 1s = profit or they just won’t ask you for heals again.

Wrong post

I don't know how I can check how many TTL packets i'm sending, but this would make sense. Seems like Android might be my limiting factor, as the device i'm now using to successfully connect is an actual Verizon Cellular Hotspot
---
If a warlock is really at the stage where they are spamming life tap and getting aggro, then just let them die. They'll get the message.
---
What lvl can u go to hillsbrad?
---
Ah yes, “sapmybutt” complaining that another person is toxic and immature and then runs to reddit to cry about it.
---
Lmao
---
holy moly you're a comedic genius
---
how did u deal with dungeon reseting? did u need a party?
---
Did you even play vanilla?
---
Oh that’s hot.
---
There are some wild posts on this sub today lmaooo
---
Vanilla was literally designed to be a casual mmorpg.
---
But I thought there wasn't anyone on the servers, so who is going to complain?

Orrrr post it using your computer?

This guide is super helpful for getting both done at the same time!

Something else I don't see in the answers so far: Guilds always recruit and players always do dungeons (where most of your pre-raid gear will come from). 
---
Even if you are late to the 60s party, 80% of the people will be still doing pre-raid content - farming mats and gold, out of boredom, gearing up alts or helping friends/guildies that recently dinged max level.
---
It won't be late even to join top guilds (if that is your thing). Everyone is always on the lookout for fresh talent.

you glorious son of a bitch

Does putting your penis in a vagina (or another butthole yay 2019) suddenly solve all mental issues?
---
I never attack horde while questing. But if I get ganked while questing I don’t do any thing but harass/kill the horde guy that killed me.
---
To be fair, it is in BRD. I can’t blame them for not telling you where to go.  It’s a damn maze.
---
Like dust in the wind...
---
As an aside, what add-on shows your energy gain bar and your druid mana bar in your unitplate?
---
they already confirmed cross realm BG's from release of BGs.
---
b-b-but you cant just dismantle my one fragile point like that
---
b-BFA IS THE REAL GAME CLASSIC ALREADY DYING
---
Nowhere in my post did I say they should deal damage with mana. I said they should either auto-attack or wand.
---
Here's the direct quote: 
---
&gt; It's not difficult to just auto-attack (druids/shammies/pallys) or just wand (priest) inbetween heals.
---
That's a valid point. So no transmog on PVP servers and BGs.
---
All blood elves are high elves that fallowed Kel'thas after the events in WCIII RoC. There are high elves that are not blood elves - i.e those that stayed in Dalaran and continued to have a source of arcane instead of fell. #getyourfactsright

Old style mmo where all modern mmos are hand holding solo adventures? Tyvm i will play classic (please send help I can't stop. 40 today so i finally havr that god damn demon horse)

Stalagg is consistently high pop, and we get que's pretty much every day. Something definitely changed last night, seem to have lost a few layers. A lot more players, and attempting to layer swap is much less effective.

Its called tbc servers, this vanilla+ doesnt work because its going to lead us to retail again at some point, and thats not taking into account the powercreep, in naxx it was so out of control some items were bis even on wotlk.
---
I don't "hate retail" though. 
---
It's almost as though you didn't read my comment at all, and just want an excuse to say something shitty.

Which would be awfully ironic considering the topic.

Christopher Walken is a legend. He's also a level 55 Priest.
---
Golly co-operation. Like dark souls
---
In basically all dungeons up to mid-50s any class that can heal can do it regardless of spec, same for tanks. My shadow priest and ret pally both do fine healing, and my arms warrior is fine tanking. You'll be fine :)
---
BGs will be cross-realm.

Elk meat

It’s 8 am dude

Nah it's definitely true for me. Buying spells when I never used them and deciding to increase my tailoring etc. Probably would have been able to afford it by now if I hadn't spent on silly things. Also reagents for teleport I must have spent a lot on them but teleporting is so damn handy

Thanks for the fix, worked for me on Fedora 30 also.
---
Have had several instances of Horde just waving and not wanting a fight, which was nice because at lvl 31 I was still undergeared as a paladin and couldn't really do anything PVP-wise.
---
But then you get the occasional rogue or warrior that thinks they want to try something.  And then the pesky hunter that you can't outrun while/after bubbling and stunning. /shrug  
---
I usually run from fights because I just don't care at the moment, I am already struggling to level while everyone passes me, I don't need to waste more time fighting people, haha.
---
Granted those number seem way too low, but what’s a “healthy” player count at 730am on a Monday for a EST server? How does that compare to the big 3?
---
Missing some key features that you might want to have if you are using it for something else than just standard business stuff.
---
Also it's not available for regular customers, so you have to get a pirated version.
---
The licences that are offered to end users are what I would consider scam. The OS is literally bloated with adware (yes, I consider unwanted bundled software adware), but what's worse, they are legit stealing your data and fucking up your drivers/routines. The consumer product is pure cancer.
---
You got a valid point. 
---
The way i see it is although it’s in game its referencing real life “scenario”
---
You (iceblocked) attempting to hide / encase yourself from the life troubles. 
---
Chestnutz aka big boi saviour (classicwow) is coming in attempting to help distract / remove those things.
---
Re-reading this makes it sound way to deep, was more of a morbid humour thing.
---
How did you take a screenshot of your keyboard?
---
Yeah I'd truly hate transmog to become a thing.
---
It’s also a reference to the office.
---
I've created a new chat window that includes everything except for the public channels (general, trade), save for World Defense. It's a relief being able to switch to that whenever I enter the Barrens or any capital city.
---
I had played on a medium population private server on and off for couple of years, and while the Barrens was still pretty bad, I had completely underestimated just how bad it would get on an official one, bustling with hundreds of people.
---
You know Alliance can tame it too, yes?
---
cool were the chests worth it? are they safe to open solo?
---
Yep.
---
Basically because of the last boss. He's like level 26 or 28 (can't remember which) so if you're 18 you just won't do any damage on the hardest fight of the dungeon. An 18 healer would maybe be ok though. 
---
I agree for the rest of the dungeon though!
---
I LOVE THIS!&lt;3
---
I'd stop accepting any sense after the "your"
---
Same goes for people speaking in "boi" or "yeet"
---
Horde one for this book is in DSM so not even that annoying...
---
&gt; (in general more adults with more money use linux, a lot of those people are nerds who like games)
---
The fact I am a gaming nerd is the reason I don't use linux. Maybe this is a outdated view but certainly 5 or so years ago it just wasn't worth the hassle, I would gain little for potential functionality issues across a variety of games. I'd rather be playing than troubleshooting.
---
I work with enterprise nix in my job so it's not like I would be uncomfortable using a GUI overlay.

i'm retarded, realised i had a totem of infliction off hand

And its you being toxic

Or contact me directly for one in trade for a month Sub.   
---
I have plenty.
---
I am level 32 and still not sure what to do.
---
I'm so over the "Can I get a layer?" in guild and general chats.
---
I assure you that way back in 2008 the dungeon finder feature would pass a poll like this. That doesn't mean the dungeon finder was all that good of an idea.
---
I'm about half done with Darkshore. Im ready for the bloodshed in Ashenvale lol
---
For noobs yes
---
1.12 is the last patch, and is also the patch that classic is based off. Due to everything in the game being available in the game in 1.12 however, blizzard has split classic up into 6 phases that loosely resemble the original patch release schedule.
---
Indeed, and I am extremely confident I will win this 1v3 under their tower!
---
I play EU Alliance, I can only play evenings/nights, I haven’t really settled on any server yet so feel free to add me I’ll happily roll a new character with you
---
I didn't need imp. Sap, i use Distarct.
---
It works for me too. (Archlinux &amp; wine 4.1)
---
Level 28 and my skinning friend has twice my gold already. You are on the right path.
---
Was killing the elite ogres in Alterac last night.  Things are going well, full group, decent comp.  We finish off one of the named mobs for a quest, I am OOM.  Group goes for the next right off (I don't blame them, heavy tag competition from both factions).  Problem is, someone pulls about 4 adds.  In the end, a rogue and I (shaman) survive and res the other players.  If I had mana to start, no one would have died.  Please wait on mana.
---
3 - 4 hours.
---
The mistake you made was trusting a rogue - faction has nothing to do with it
---
Forbidden - Benediction
---
very chill new guild looking for kind players to help each other and make lasting friendships as we progress through the game.
---
https://discord.gg/zw9QZR6
---
Yeah, that'll make up for the 30k rep I'm missing till exalted.
---
I miss maybe 6-8k from not doing Teldrassil and Ashenvale.
---
And Band-aids, dont forget them
---
This is true, idk why he was down voted. The one in loch modan is also a hunter.
---
My work buddies all agree that a vast majority of retail players will go back to retail once they're at 60 for a while. Up until that point, they're fine, but once they hit endgame and get bored, they'll be out. I'm hoping that isn't the case.
---
Trust fall is NOT by any means the last quest in that chain *shudders in priest*
---
Those are some nice statistics! Comparing those to the Pserver raid composition (for the horde side) we get:
---
Warrior -2.98581769436997
---
Mage -0.750938337801609
---
Priest -0.281608579088472
---
Shaman 0.246246648793565
---
Rogue 0.426916890080429
---
Warlock 0.608552278820375
---
Druid 1.00699731903485
---
Hunter 1.72965147453083
---
So Horde has not enough warriors and way to many Hunters and Druids compared to raid spots they can expect.
---
Ofcourse not everyone will raid and a whole lot of these characters will never reach 60. There are a lot more variables then just these.
---
Honestly the real problem was that people above the level couldn't do it without causing massive XP loss.
---
The real solution is allowing anyone above the level of content to help without:
---
* Causing XP loss
---
* Making the content trivial
---
* The high-level helper not gaining anything from it
---
If those were fixed old content would be rerun more often, because the lower level dungeons are still fun, but its trivial now and you're not really helping anyone.
---
On the other hand it's important not to scale everything otherwise all progress in level and stats becomes meaningless and feels really inconsequential
---
Just curious, when it says “up to 40” what does that actually mean? That it could be less than that?
---
ideal place to train some weapon skills then
---
Ya, it was just a trick to get fools to move.
---
You will have to reroll back on Herod soon to play on a populated server. In the mean time queues are very slightly less.
---
I love this damn game.
---
As an original vanilla player, I did like the addition of achievements just to personally track things I've done.  However, they shouldn't be able to be linked.
---
Even to add on top of this, I would wait for bgs after a little bit, the markets gonna flood with people saving this for the very same time you are and yes rogues are gonna be hungry for it, I would personally wait to how the market is after BG's release (If its not flooded sell it, but If it is wait for it to be really rare again till you got new twinks fighting over it/spamming chat for it etc)
---
"You know your pet's growl is on right?" "Yeah"
---
Between the pet and Earth Shock we were doing things on hardmode.
---
I strongly recommend leveling with a succubus once your VW starts having aggro issues in the mid/late 20s and using the draintank method. Basically send your succy at a mob while you CoA+Corr, then drain life 1-3 times. Lifetap (and dark pact once you get it) while you’re running between mobs or looting. Stack as much shadow damage as you can to make your drain and dots more efficient. Disable most/all of your succy abilities so she can feed you mana via dark pact and also have mana to seduce as needed. Getting comfortable with seduce (it should be hotkeyed) will pay dividends later in PvP or dungeons.
---
If you do it right you’ll have no downtime and kill a mob every 20 seconds while grinding. If you have decent +damage gear for your level you should also be able to hit a second target with Siphon, Agony, Corruption, and Fear and it will come crawling back to you with barely any health after your first target is dead. Obviously don’t do this in crowded areas with social mobs and be sure your pet doesn’t grab extra stuff chasing after it.
---
&gt;All blood elves are high elves that fallowed Kel'thas after the events in WCIII RoC. There are high elves that are not blood elves - i.e those that stayed in Dalaran and continued to have a source of arcane instead of fell. #getyourfactsright
---
Could you elaborate a bit on the gift voucher from the original Collector's Edition? If you bought it and used it 15 years ago it's still available to use in Classic? Also, send ~~nudes~~ pics please &lt;3
---
Happy cake day.
---
I did this recently with the basilisk things in the Shimmering Flats as I was a couple of levels too low. Spotted the horde guy doing it and helped him, then after once I tagged he helped me. This was PvE though.
---
&gt; drain life will certainly give more health than the mana cost if talented or the user has even a small amount of SP
---
Sure. But even 5/5 talented and with a small amount of spellpower, we are talking something like a 230 health return on a 185 mana invested for rank 4 drain life. It isn't bad, but it isn't some miracle method for infinite ressources - especially because spamming drain life will have you steal aggro pretty quickly. 
---
In my experience, it is more efficient to just pull several mobs at a time and spam DoTs then drink or bandage than to wait for voidwalker aggro and slowly wand/drain every pull.
---
The first page and I’m on mobile
---
This is the bane of my existance as a tank in classic. The worse part is my group of friends does this to no end: "I am not doing anything, I am just dpsing". Here are some more annoying things:  
---
* I often dont even get to pull a mob because someone hits them as I am running up to them
---
* Hunters just spam multi-shot as much as possible
---
* Warlocks dot every single mob often well before you have a chance to build threat
---
* Pets pull every mob imagineable
---
* Mages want to AoE everything
---
I am not saying I am an amazing tank but life sure is difficult as one.
---
Yeah spending time on &lt;10k viewer streams raging about asmon accepting gold :&gt;
---
My entire friend group did go back to retail. Most of them last played in MoP. I am the only one left playing Classic.
---
I mean I did it all week with wool cloth and was selling that shit like it was nothing so yeah it is
---
Only those foolish enough to level as MM
---
i’m pretty sure the weather effects are less pronounced though?
---
I understand that rogues have more CC and do more damage, but druids have survivabilty, mobility and heals.
---
The power of the infinity bags
---
Not really the strangest, but I just couldn’t believe the incompetence. I had done a few Deadmines runs in Classic at this point, already; so I knew that it was a cake walk even if you haven’t done it before. I got in a group and instantly noticed that two people were only level 16. Not a huge deal, so I stayed.
---
These people wiped us 4/5 in Deadmines.. I was shocked. Not only that, the tank hardly took any initiative and seemed very timid when making pulls, even considering that it’s Classic. It also got on my nerves because they kept laughing it off, as if we were there for progression and the time we were wasting was understandable. Honestly a horrible experience, but I guess I can’t blame them if they’re new.
---
Good one, made my day
---
A huntard told me the healing mattered to heal his pet. So yeah.... 🙄
---
As a mage I can say I'm totally jelly of that. damn
---
You’re honestly just on reddit to be a sjw so I’m not going to dignify that with a response
---
&gt; Streamers influence this game a lot even on this level
---
You say this as if people weren't exclusively running SM from 30-40 in the original days of Vanilla. 
---
It's fun and efficient leveling with some great rewards for most classes.
---
Don't under estimate pugs, as long as they know the fight and have the right composition, it's not too bad.
---
Played quite a bit with my youngest boy, every so often he’d disappear, finally found him in the tram station shooting rats, for HOURS.

Me :)

upvote for guild shenanigans
---
&gt; Is it worth keeping good twink stuff for phase 3
---
&gt;  Blackrock Champion's Axe which is a lv 19 BOE with +8 Str. Is it worth keeping this to sell it to twinks
---
no. cruel barb is a 1H with virtually the same stats. twinks could also use a shield with a +7 stam enchant.
---
Most players will still never see that content.  Just the process of gearing up and collecting that many players for a 4+ hour commitment is enough to bar most people from entry.
---
I think new raids would be silly for this reason.
---
imagine playing WoW to pve 😂😂😂
---
You on Herod OP?
---
Cut out the UI and we have a new Meme!
---
If you have a wand a void walker and spec affliction you never use all your mana
---
But rested xp is "only" 2 full levels right?
---
You had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
That racial pertains to melee swings
---
Yes I too enjoy having ads and software I don't want forced onto my machine by my OS vendor.
---
Or just one that isn't terrible
---
They got me in the first half not gonna lie
---
Wear more shadow damage gear. In my 50s while draintanking my drain life cost 300 mana and did 530 damage+healing.
---
Only place I've noticed it is Tirisfal chat, but the only Orc/Troll I've spent any time on so far was on a low pop server while all the realms were going up and down on Saturday.
---
I haven't spent any time in Northshire or Westfall, but human starting zones are usually pretty full of nonsense too. Only place I've seen the Trump stuff is horde, though.
---
a couple of hundred casters at the auction will burn your eyes, video card, and house

Look through the key bindings you can bind a key for every icon. I use f1 - f9
---
I’m 60 and already cleared most of mc and those stats made me salivate. Staff of dominance dropped tonight too and I lost the roll by 2 points :(
---
in another 15 years. WoW Reborn
---
If I've learned anything from my time in MMO's, then it's the fact that people don't just do things because they are fun. At least not for long. There needs to be a considerable reward for high level characters running low level content otherwise nobody will care. Maybe if you want to help out a friend, but certainly not for total strangers that just asked you nicely to run a dungeon you gain nothing from.
---
I thought OP was Ljuginte.
---
It's the really the only way this post wouldn't have been a spectacular self-own, because literally everyone else involved in that conversation comes off like a colossal idiot.
---
That’s not how racism functions irl.
---
or if you are a warrior tanking more than 2 mobs. Spam Demo Shout and never lose threat no matter what your dps do...
---
Agreed, I am currently at work and have not been able to verify the two major solutions found.  As soon as I'm home and can test both true IPv6 and the TTL change, I have to assume these are selective  solutions.  They do however look very promising and I have high hopes for the short term.  Blizzard does need to fix this though.
---
Hmm. Nope. The mount tunnelvision started about friday
---
parasite leeching some work of others to make some money, using other people content.
---
huh? Could you explain this please? A backdoor?
---
Aw man, that's really sweet of u to say! :D
---
I have more self-respect than that. Windows is malware.
---
Awesome story, was thinking about that 1 too when it comes to bombin spots when they are taken by an other ally..
---
But your story is great :)
---
I have absolutely no idea what any of this has to do with SJW lol
---
Thanks! ♥
---
I LOVE SELLIN’ BLOOOOW
---
As a hunter you are only interested in the stats of the melee weps. What type it is does not matter.
---
I see no problem with one race having two factions in different sides of a war. Makes it more believable. The nazi and the american armies were both humans (as far as we know).
---
Druid or Shaman?
---
This makes me wet.
---
As a player and a developer, it makes sense to do TBC is classic does well.
---
That being said if classic did well and TBC did well I personally think that though the next logical step might be to go into WoTLK and stop there, that maybe instead, do a classic+ where they do elements that did not occur in classic but they wanted to.
---
An example would be the emerald dream or do it in a way where it does a classic 1.5 and fills in elements between classic and TBC that way you could then go into WoTLK but do another classic+ after that, which would fill gaps between TBC and WoTLK.
---
You could then have a classic and retail experience where "wow2" would be something that brings both concepts together, in maybe a moba like / doing co op scenarios from the lore, fashion.

Don’t even need to look at the image and I already know it’s about stitches.
---
sadly not familiar with that quote lol
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
I got more joy and excitement from a 6 slot bag drop in classic than literally anything I got from BFA in the 4 months I played.
---
I know... No offence meant
---
as a hunter the axe skill is fairly useless imo
---
Warriors are in fairly high demand, as the best raid tank, as well as a fairly high DPS class, they excel in multiple roles.
---
what resolution do you have? I am using elvui too and there is no way i could have the "layout" in the same way as you while everything is still big. Is it more than 1080p?
---
no, Firemaw EU
---
Exact reason I left stallag as Ally when server transfers opened.  There was simply no way to level from 30-40 but SM because it was impossible to get quests done.  Unless horde active pop falls off hard I'd honestly expect the ally pop to become non existant outside die hard pvpers there before much longer
---
As a hunter you should only consider a weapon when it gives you better stats such as agility. Hence the term stat stick. Basically your weapon is just there to provide stats to boost your ranged damage. It might seem odd but it would be worth it to take a lower dps staff that had more agility than an axe.
---
Linen bags on my server are being put up on the AH for less than their vendor price. Can literally buy them, vendor them, and make a few copper.
---
Not worth the effort for a few copper. It does leave me having to decide whether or not I need to believe those people are doing it intentionally to help out the lower level folks, or if they're just dumb, though.
---
2 Hours left. We should be working instead of browsing reddit
---
"just started"  
---
I'm pretty sure my post states my ilvl is 370 and my comments mention that I started at the arse end of TbC/start of WotLK?
---
So, at this point either your reading comprehension is pisspoor or you're just trying to troll me?  
---
Either way your case and point of what's wrong with the community, gross, toxic, and trying to pick a fight over nothing at all. You're getting so defensive and personally offended over my experience of retail, see a doctor dude.  
---
Peace out mate.
---
First time I’ve ever seen WOW gameplay
---
Craving to level up with my friends who have never played Classic before.   
---
Now 5 of them are playing while I sit here in retail WoW..
---
I like Quin but the played up raging gets to me a bit....you dont have to shout to be entertaining
---
This story brought a tear to my eye. 
---
For the horde!
---
But they've has the tech for fishing lines since vanilla launch...
---
How viable are druids at their different roles in clasic in PvE? Are they able to hold their own as all four categoies?
---
I read "achievements" and was like oh okay that'd be cool to track progress and shit and then everything below that I was like "FUCK NO FUCK THIS ABSOLUTELY NOT"
---
It's not the streamers,these are leechers that use popular streamers content, upload on youtube to make money.
---
For pve, it’s worth less than +1 AP.* For pvp, it’s a negligible bonus. 
---
*If your job is to swing nightfall and get some auto-shots in as well, congrats; you picked the least bad option.
---
&gt; That shit was harder than bc
---
I tanked all that content, and 100% don't agree lol.
---
He was from Bucharest too, so I'm sure he just got shipped the fuck back and is still doing that garbage.
---
Troll hunters for life!
---
Invest now.
---
Wtf is this audio?
---
Have fun with that epic mount though
---
Old [Napoleon Dynamite](https://youtu.be/dhv8Cfzv-04) scene from the vanilla era.
---
I'm not so worried about healers dpsing, save for using dots, because it can trip you up with the GCD. It's not a big problem if they're good, and if you've got a paladin who's judged the mana on hit seal (the name eludes me ATM), then go for it, but really their damage contribution is so minimal it's not that big a deal.
---
The whole point of the Need system is for people to be able to need on items that are an upgrade for them.
---
That is literally the entire reason that the Need button exists in the first place.
---
If you just want the item to sell it, then you want it out of greed.
---
Did you know there is a button for that too?  It's called the Greed button.
---
We had a herod MC last night that went 8/10 and mageblade dropped too. No one in our guild won roll :(
---
Oh fuck off lmao
---
Keep thick+. Thick is used in all of the specializations, rugged is used in runecloth bags.
---
Yeah, but that's not hard to do yourself if you plan on it tbh
---
I am back on retail. I personally prefer it over Classic but that is not me saying Classic is worse or not worth playing... I do enjoy Classic still because I like the challenge I just no longer have time for that grind to get to end game.
---
I did this in vanilla and recast it a few times. You can't make it to Darkshore :(
---
&gt; For our run however the warrior wanted to tank and the shaman wanted to dps
---
If someone wants to DPS and they just so happen to hold threat for every pull, then they *are* the tank by default whether they wanted to be it or not. Heck, I've been healing 4 "dps" groups because the difference between tank and dps is so slight pre-50.
---
Might not be a good thing to say, but you can always go to ff14 like I did. I play it on Ubuntu 18.04 without issues.
---
It would be hard to scrap flying in WOTLK without redesigning significant chunks of Icecrown and nearly all of Storm Peaks, but I have to admit the idea of being forced to explore those areas on foot alone would make them all the more impressive and intimidating.
---
As a hunter your primary concern with your melee weapon should always be the stats. The +skill with axes only applies if you are attacking with the axe. As you level your looking for agility and attack power on your melee to improve your ranged damage.
---
How do you delete someone else’s post?

Record your gameplay. Review the fights later on, you'll probably notice a lot of obvious things you could've done and might remember to act on those analogous situations in the future.
---
I've been doing SM runs with 5 paladins in the group.  It's hilariously easy. Everyone can heal.  We have every aura on.  We have every blessing on each other.
---
All hail Lord Inglip
---
that’s what I assumed, yet I also stared at it for a while like ????
---
SFK up to 30? i went there at 28 and oh boy did i get nearly zero xp.
---
This is awesome as hell. Wish my friends still lanned or wanted to group game. Most of us are just soloing classic. Still fun but definitely miss this stuff
---
Just arrowsss
---
You are correct, but when you are leveling and trying to save money you should be killing everything anyway.
---
Nah, the AOE fear "Howl of Terror" maybe? Don't recall.
---
Ah that's some good news! I mean, yeah, 5.3 is still far away. But it's a good thing in general that it happens.
---
Except it's not really saving you any time.  Those items come from quest hubs.  You'll need those hubs at some point, if for nothing else, then to have the flightmaster waypoint.
---
I play on horde so a good example is you'll need Brackenwall Village flightpoint eventually, and as a horde player you'll definitely want the Shadowprey Village flightpoing in Desolace for the other book.  
---
And for what it's worth, it's easy for you to make bloviated statements here on reddit about how "you'll pay 20% markup to save you 20 minute trips", but will you really?  In a new economy especially?  I highly doubt it.  For one, you used the alliteration staistical fallacy:  (15 minutes can save you 15% or more at GEICO!).  You used 20 minutes, and 20 percent as an example that "seemed right" in your head.  But in actuality isn't.  Your brain just saw 20 and thought "ooh that's a good number".  But generally speaking, your average adult balks at taxes IRL even at a measly 4-6%.  (i.e. most states sales tax)
---
The one you really have to worry about is the 200 pound catfish.
---
&gt; Sure, but these bosses lived for like 2mins while almost zerging them without doing a proper strat.
---
Well, thats MC for you.
---
Thanks! I really appreciate it!

yes, but TSM is far from simple.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks, I would say no transmog whatsoever.
---
We already have pets tho
---
Its only a grind if you make it a grind. Classic isn't about being 60.
---
Hide that.
---
I'll put it this way. The cost of trying is needing a respec and to grab new gear. Long before you're crazy geared you'll know if you like it.
---
Power to you mate, go test it out :)
---
While Harry the Paladin on the bottom of the pic is said to be still fighting with his own hammer for dominance.

i mean who doesn’t threaten you over a first aid book from time to time
---
Keep this shit content between yourself and the twitch fanboys.
---
I've been healing all dungeons (dinged 30 last night), you're fine speccing shadow :)
---
I've specced shadow up until I got mind flay now I'm putting points into discipline for PW:F and PW:S boosts and more mana/utility.
---
From what I've heard and felt so far, this is fine up until 40-50 when it might get harder to do dedicated dung healing without speccing into the right trees more.
---
Just be aware of mana costs and strength of heals (most people will use lower rank of the same heals on the skillbar for mana conservation/weaker heals) and not to go crazy on dps while healing or you'll be OoM before the end of an encounter which you do not want. Having mana throughout the fight is EVERYTHING.
---
/cluck
---
What's played? 15 min a day?
---
You can see they're on Razorgore in the bottom, and I'm guessing horde since he joined Barrens chat.
---
Good chuckle there.
---
Honestly TSM is going to be the most fully featured, and the info it slams in your tooltip is useful. While you may not want everything it does, you may eventually grow into it. I find the sniper feature to be useful for finding cloth and other raw mats that are priced "too low" and I snag them and relist at a higher price.
---
And?
---
Server: Thunderfury
---
Faction: Horde
---
Detail: Level 24 Priest
---
Experience: First time WoWing!
---
So, in the great launch server debacle of 2019 i rerolled onto Thunderfury. looking for other folks progressing at this sort of pace, that i can group with and practice my group healing on before i finally try a dungeon. or just to quest in general :)
---
You get 55 silver for every 5 shellfish you hand in you also get random boots drop from the cage and kill the monsters you can also get a fishing rod which sells on the AH or you can just vendor for another 33 silver
---
I don't get it.
---
Guaranteed if you put 50g in a trade window with anybody complaining about him they'd accept it
---
Was the secret to your success Hot Key Binding = 1?
---
to be fair, this is nothing like the private server experience either. it's something different entirely
---
You will only get invited as healer, MAYBE tank but you will most likely get declined a lot as tank. Out of the 4 healers, druid is probably the least desired. Druids really took a hard hit by the "hybrid tax" since they have 4 roles instead of 2 or 3 as the other hybrids. Hybrid tax = the more roles you can fill the worse you will be at each of them outside of your "designed" role i.e healing pretty much since all hybrids are the healers and all their tier gear are itemized towards healing.. only exception to this are warriors, they can't heal and they're the best tank and dps.
---
Dab the haters. I won't listen to your video because I don't care either, but these other guys are jerks and I'm the cool dude that encourages you.
---
Howl of terror is a 2 sec cast, slower than normal fear. I don't use it much at all.
---
Earth elementals in badlands. Vendor everything except earth element, sell that on AH. You can make around 8g an hour. Went from 30g to 82g in two days grinding when my friends were not on. Sometimes the spot is a little packed though :(
---
You should be tanking with a 2H, a shield is only used in specific situations as an oh shit button. Anyone who thinks otherwise is ignorant and should go read the FAQs on the fight club discord. 
---
Op join the classic warrior discord
---
It buys them some time, while without that block, no users would be able to use the service on a satisfactory level.
---
That's a simple decision.
---
I guess the strangest "party" was myself as a nelf hunter, a nelf priest, human warrior, orc warrior and and orc hunter. We did the quest for Whirlwind Axe for both of the warriors without much friendly fire.
---
I have 1 to 6 spells then bind when i hold shift+1 shift+2 etc also till 6 and same with ALT. then few mouse binds ( 5 binds on mouse ) and extra spells on V and B and shift+B. if you level up one toon and play even semi consistantly you will develop muscle memmory. and you wont think about presing alt+3 for X spell but u will think presing X spell and fingers will do they work.
---
For pvp it really just comes down to your skill and that has been a fact for years. Managing CDs and cc is what’s going to make the difference in any 1v1 or 2v2. Just practice practice practice
---
AFAIK The main problem of DDoS/DoS is that you can forge senders IP (attackers IP) because you don't need any answer. 
---
And also its probably zombie computers (random computers infected by attacker virus), that makes it worse.
---
So very hard and not worth the effort IMO
---
Sorry, who's Yogg?
---
lol almost downvoted.
---
&gt; Well, I'm definitely not buying the ad filled consumer version, so yes, there is a way to get it.
---
Not legitimately.
---
&gt; I have no issue whatsoever with shadowplay or CUDA. Neither does anyone on MDL forums.
---
It's missing Media Feature Pack - that's what it's called. Without it, it doesn't work and it often doesn't play well with it. Without ~~spending~~ wasting too much of my time, I can safely speculate that some other components are missing from that version as well.
---
&gt; I guess security updates keep the most amateur of hackers from stealing your data, so there's that.

It made me laugh after years of seeing that tiny purple bubble only to see the actual floating Dalaran being a fucking *massive* city. I didn't know much about the lore at the time but when I came across that bubble I assumed Dalaran was, like, one large house.
---
I rezzed someone in duskwood as druid yesterday. Died right after the cast. Came back to find they didn't even accept it.
---
wow. +1.
---
Totally impressed at the timing there.
---
Thanks for the encouragement!  I don't need you to listen to it necessarily, just watch it on mute ;)
---
it's a retarded design choice? Obviously the reason why the level cap got increased in the first place.
---
Uhhh I wish I knew that... I always just gave my pet the meat I found. If I didn't have any I gave him the highest one I could use myself.
---
I'm sure there is a "best way" but you'll have to ask a better hunter for that :D
---
Are you implying that 100k people can't be trash? Lol
---
They are trash.
---
I thought he was trying to say Elevator, go up and down...
---
Oh for real? I remembered it having it for some reason. Maybe they could edit it for no flying? I dunno, it's fun to dream though :)
---
What rotation and addons do you use for healing?
---
I know mana is the thing in healing but want to know how to manage it so i can heal the full dungeon ( farm ) run.
---
True!
---
It's weird I only get it with WoW but I guess it is the social nature of the game in terms of forming relationships. I play loads of other 'retro' games and just enjoy them for what they are.
---
For WoW? You have one?
---
I mean the guild name checks out
---
All I see is that damage as a 39 rogue. 🤤
---
Funny, you should have timed it with a /wave too.
---
&gt; Unless you're really bad at PvP I suppose.
---
Or you're just on the outnumbered side.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. I rolled PvP, I enjoy PvP, and I don't mind getting ganked. It's part of it. But 90+% of the time when you die in the world it's not because of your skill level in PvP.
---
What a hot take.
---
Done!
---
Shamans can still use staves without the talent, and are likely rocking Crescent Staff at that point(or once they finish their first WC run)
---
yea with bows you will just wont miss so offten.
---
Yeah I found a blue post to back it up. Weapon skill gives you at least 1% extra hit rating.
---
Got no time for having alts.  Leveling and getting gear takes too long.
---
VPN worked for me, thanks man!
---
Alliance paladin on Windseeker looking for others who play after work or on weekends. I'd love to add more people to my friends list for doing dungeons and group quests. I am a healer. Message for battletag.
---
CAREFUL, NED, CAREFUL NOW.
---
I have already done the leveling so many times I have no interest in it anymore though. I know I am probably in the minority here but I have just leveled characters so many times I am not sure I want to do it again.
---
LMAO no he is not. 
---
Get better taste
---
I personnaly use Q for combat, E for berserker and R for defensive. 
---
All stance dependent spell are binded to 1-9 and in the first spell bar (the one swapping when changing stance). 
---
All Other spell are binded on shift + 1-9 or W-X-C-V-F-G for "ho shit" spell.
---
I have a 12 buttons mouse so it really help for spell binded to 5-9 and basically only use it, never 1-9 on keyboard.
---
Did you just notice this reference? Lol
---
Either way, great video :)
---
Player, gear, fighting environment... there are a lot of variables that can change the fight. Also best depends on what kind of pvp you desire to have. In terms of killing rogue is better, however, rogues lack mobility that defines druids. In a wide big environment druid is superior even if he cannot kill the rogue and ran away. In a small room, well :)
---
World pvp mostly not based on numbers but skills and practicability (if this is a actual word). These are my subjective opinions tho.
---
You me?
---
Thats how you play the game. As cliche as it sounds you just gotta git gud 🤷‍♂️
---
I would too!
---
What's the reason in why they are doing this is a common question.
---
Who knows maybe they are retail fan that has thrown their whole life at wow, and now classic is the new hot and they are butt hurt they can't show off in retail anymore as in no one there? Who knows.
---
I know, we all know the whole ddos thing is a pain no doubt.
---
However i feel it's backfiring on their objective of breaking up the community in that its only bringing the community even closer together on global topic for us all to talk about and share in game.
---
You're free to speculate as much as you'd like, I've been using it for a year and it's the most lightweight OS I've ever used, especially for gaming and editing

Isn't that true for every subreddit tho?

In fairness I didn't have any points in Improved Blizzard, so they weren't even slowed as they all aggro'd me at once. That would have probably helped.
---

---
Mmm, no. No the min maxing is not intense.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about staves. I stand corrected, thanks.
---
Sly
---
There was one today in general chat. Homie posted up in alterac mountains “so n so is blacklisted! Orc hunter!”
---
So I asked why. He replied I was mining a node and he lead a pack of yetis to me and feign death and the yetis aggro’d on me and he mined while I fought them off
---
You allow Alliance player to help first, then you pretend to help, but finish off said Alliance player.  That's the only way.  The Horde way.  ZUG ZUG!
---
I miss doing shit like that. Enjoy the adventure man
---
*earn this...*

---
Flirting with disaster, I like it!
---
My census plus results are up to 18000 characters... Is mine a bad data set? No way benediction is that much higher population on horde...
---
As mentioned, maybe try playing a class who's entire thing is to jump people from stealth when they can't get an even fight. Or, you know, play alliance and you'll have plenty of opportunities to get ganked by UD rogues and fight back.
---
I see whut u did thar
---
Gimme the Sparknotes. I like supporting the little guy, but I don't have time to listen to this right now.
---
Im playing there quite casually alliance-side, moved from Firemaw.   
---
People need to keep in mind its a new server, new players join and begin levelling every day :)
---
Orange. With a hint of raspberry
---
Quest.
---
You get more and more gold as you do quests, vendor stuff etc. 
---
I dinged 40 with ~35 gold in my pocket. I bought my mount around 45, and i've dinged 50 last night with ~120 gold in my pocket. 
---
I have not grinded anything meaningful (i think longest was like 1hr grind at some point as i was waiting for guildies).
---
You blew your load way to fast. Just go stand on the IF bridge in front of the AH to swell your epeen back up and start an alt.
---
Does he stream?
---
As someone who is playing a hunter for the first time...yep. If you can avoid my pet and get inside my range limit without letting me boop you with an axe, I am toast. I just wish people actually in my lvl range would attack me. Not much anyone can do when ?? Rogue backstabs you.
---
low quality high effort, i like it
---
what server?
---
I did ZF with sourskittles!!
---
I prefer escalators and eels.
---
Or to outlands through the deadmines!
---
Made a char on noggenogger this weekend, can confirm. People are .. different.
---
IIRC, the first time you try installing something that’s not from the store it prompts you that option.
---
Windows 10 S is a more secure way for windows to operate but you can opt off.
---
Shadowed unit frames as someone else suggested.  Everything can be adjusted to look how you’d like.  Mine look like the elvui unit frames, but without all of the other stuff it alters and adds.  
---
SUF felt a lot easier to tweak to get the look I wanted than elv.  
---
Elv is basically a replacement for unit frames, titan panel, bagnon, nameplates, hotbar,  ct buffmod, and sexy minimaps.
---

---
I don’t have the link but a good tip to go by is farming animals that are in large quantities, because the grey items they drop normally go for quite a bit of silver. Otherwise you need to farm humanoids that are high density. You’ll get silver and cloth
---
kargoz and punkrat have been my main resources in wow classic preparation. Madseasonshow added here and there. North is a well known gnome mage expert who has helped put together some guides
---
Like that has ever happened in the history of the internet lol
---
If someone's getting thier jollies stopping you from gaining accomplishment. The point of playing is the gratification of accomplishing that thing despite all the hardships!
---
*poof two items appeared*
---
Imagine what kind of person does this.
---
'tis magnificent. Do this (but to filthy horde-children ofc)
---
And yet, the NE Wetlands run is still a thing.
---
Grey drop? How much gold for that?
---
Northern STV the tigers and panthers drop whiskers thar vendor for 7s. 
---
Desolate the basilisk and centaurs are not bad to grind.
---
Farm SM GY
---
I can verify that i dinged 50 last night and tried to find it on my warrior, and couldnt.
---
There's a repeatable quest in Desolace where you swim and open cages to collect fish. 5 fish is 55 silver. Not an awful return, and if you have a swim speed buff and underwater breathing, you could do some damage I think.
---
I mean at max I get a 50 silver turnaround so I only ever bought 2-3 books at a time considering they were 90s. Several people like this guy already had 10 books on all day. Was just selling them cheap to earn a couple gold for my mount over time
---
The risk was so high yet the reward was so low
---
I vividly remember being in Best Buy on 11/23/2004 and looking at both the regular and collectors edition, trying to decide if the collectors edition was worth the extra money. I thought to myself "*I probably won't be playing the game in a month, I'll save the $20*" and just got the regular version. 
---
Well, that "month" turned into about 9 years as I played into MoP, and here I am 15 years later playing Classic. One of my biggest WoW regrets is not spending that extra $20.
---
Your thinking to much into it. Besides hunter and lock most classes have challenging leveling. Don’t worry about endgame, it’s a long way away. 
---
On top of that, there’s no rush. Play something, if you don’t like it reroll. I’ve rerolled 3 times. Just jump in!
---
Balance changes are possible, but also a lot of the performance issues of certain specs are due to poor itemization. Maybe the new content gives druid tanks a tier set and there's no problem anymore, even without balance changes.
---
What opperating system.
---
Are you tethered to a phone/hotspot
---
The game looks more like a mobile game tbh, 15 years is a lot.
---
Are locks really that rare on alliance I have literally heard that more than once. Do rogues have a good air farm or anything similar?
---
2 hours ago most everyone is asleep or getting ready for work...
---
They didn't get rid of paint, but either way you can just paste it directly into imgur or the reddit "submit link" page.
---
BRO. THAT'S WHY ALL MY WATER KEEPS FUCKING DISAPPEARING?? I been playing this game since Wrath...
---
well its classic so its gonna be a grind anyway. Just roll druid
---
Enchanters can craft wands. He's talking about Lesser Magic Wand and Greater Magic Wand. You'll find them on the auction house, or similarly you may seek out an enchanter to make you the wand(s) if you bring them the materials to do so. See Classic Wowhead to find that information.
---
&gt; Mid level ret aint nothing to fuck around with.
---
Tell that to the 36 pally I repeatedly put into the dirt while he was trying to gank me (31 shaman) trying to kill some yetis. 
---
Purge makes paladins a wet noodle, couldn't be easier &gt;:)
---
You need battle.net on the flashdrive. Log in and then launch wow
---
Do you have an internet connection?
---
I could completely understand why this was an assumption, because any time you eat food or drink water or whatever mages use for mana, your character does in fact sit down.
---
Hopefully we can start defining "LFM SM Catheral, classic run".
---
you're taking a video game way too seriously.
---
You say that from memory, 15y of memory. While blizzard says this was how it is. Who should I trust hmmm?
---
Also no use whining about it while you get ganked by warriors and can’t escape. Better learn to do it again or delete your hunter tbh since it’s really important to be able to do it consistently.
---
What class?! Depending on what class you are you can look up the most optimized spots for you! My plan is to solo run SM LIB first 2 rooms over and over for a level or2....since the AH is soo young and still very unstable you can’t rely on that so you basically have to pull gold from the game itself
---
probably need battle net running in the background as well?
---
That's based on the mage's point of view, though. Not the warrior hero charging in. 
---
Since he has a WW axe, he's probably somewhere between 30 and 45
---
Best moments in Classic are when others come and help. You just feel relieved for some reason.
---
On a public wifi, windows 10
---
That makes me a sad orc. I really wanted to smash extra hard going to 60 using the crit trinket.
---
Uh, yes
---
While it sucks to get ganked by some high level hunting low levels.  There can be some pretty fun encounters with groups similar level. I haven't reached a PvP zone but I remember the battles in hillsbrad back in vanilla.  Seems like the yeti cave was a big war zone
---
Do you mean 'enjoy farming epics and rare drops in MC for the next two months'?
---
Yeah I think i flew between sepulcher and UC 4 times in like 30 minutes... I guess i could abuse the unstuck system to get around the 1 hour cooldown for the hearthstone.
---
Yes Tree's and tree trunks don't do their Job as tree's.
---
They would much rather be "Air" in a Brownish Color.
---
can't blame them... they didn't choose to be trees
---
It's annoying though since you can't change windows settings at all without it activated.
---
I bought a laptop while living in Korea and it turns out they put on a business license version of windows that requires renewal by a server admin every three months. I have lived with it but it's obnoxious.
---
Another though... maybe it's just autoloot being too slow?
---
That's quite the hard counter. Cant purge if you're stunned for 6sec while I bop your head off with crusader cits tho ;)
---
I just drink soylent so I don’t have to decide
---
Honestly those were so much fun despite their difficulty.
---
We had to actually CC for the first time since magister’s terrace! 
---
A few guildies and I managed to grab the volcanic stone drake after a week. While cata was the nail in the coffin for me, (quit before firelands), early cata was some of the best wow I’ve ever played
---
That sounds like fun. I've been getting too many tryhards/:
---
Rock elementals in bad lands or farm ogres for silk
---
No one cares
---
Dances in elemental rogue
---
Poly the pet and just freeze the hunter and stand in his dead zone. Cant do anything when I'm frozen in place and you get in my dead zone.
---
I didn't know that when I made the video, but yes you are correct!  I'll have to change that later
---
I'm not asking for opinions or proof; OP had an issue with druid tanking, snarky commenter just said "play warrior" and my question to snarky commenter is what abilities does a warrior have that would have corrected this situation in comparison to druid?
---
My guess is the rogue does.
---
Linux and Linux based OS devices are the lions share of all worldwide traffic.  In that sense Windows itself is a minority.  Your argumemt is completely incorrect.
---
Also, Linux continues to gain on Windows in both every day usage and gaming usage daily.  In the last year it has doubled it's cumulative numbers as an end station directly taking from Windows.  This is why many companies have begun shifting development to open source such as Vulkan for gaming.
---
In a true sense of the word minority, as far as network traffic goes, it's windows that's a minority, it's also the host to the most malware.
---
Herod is still a full server. Of course theres going to be 50+ everywhere.  You can't expect a server to be populated yet that just opened
---
Anybody have page 8? I have extras for pages 3, 4, and 6

Remember that mob that aggroed you and ran away? Well, he's now killing you in spirit by not alllowing you to eat, drink nor res people.
---
Dumb question, how do I access the UI like that for the add-on?
---
Really makes be believe that Blizzard or whom ever provides the AntiDDoS service is not of professional or experienced character. As a network engineer with experience in AntiDDoS and Firewalls i can say that problems like this should never happen and this is clearly a quick fix because they did not know any better than to not allow lower ttl or they have extra hops behind that uses the hops without "adding them back" as any sane solution would.  
---
The person that made the filter really needs to read up on their regex expressions and re analyse the packages coming through as they just went for the quick and dirty fix instead of doing a quick test on a test server with legitimate login session (heck most products have a learning feature for this).
---
It doesn't though. Ganking only leads to frustration for the person being ganked. The reason people do it is because they get enjoyment from ruining someone else's time. Nothing else.
---
Sad part is Activision really thinks people will go to retail after Classic...
---
That’s what i said :-)
---
Just get reported enough in a short period people were reporting me for my guild recruit macro earlier today. I must have reached the threshold as I got muted about an hour ago.
---
Lol really?! I’ve done ctrl alt prt screen for decades TIL
---
I can’t imagine leveling through twice so I just want something to hit 60 and keep geared through the patches
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
*Why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?*
---
I’d take the achieves and pets, and maybe a guild bank but that’s about all I can think of. Definitely never add flying or heirlooms
---
After a class rebalance, adding a bunch of horizontal progression in the form of mc/bwl equivalent 10/20/40 mans to give people more ways to gear up for naxx would give people more content to see without stacking higher ilvls on the top players.
---
It would give a place for them to add additional sets as well, giving more gearing options to hybrids who have to scavenge random pieces together to try and make working gear.
---
Personally I would love some classic+ but I think that it's at least 5 years away from being something that's even considered. They have to run out the phases in classic, adding BC and Wrath servers would be easier and they are just as in demand if not more so than classic+, and then there's a lot of discussion to be had about what exactly classic+ would entail. It's fun to think about but holding your breath for it is a bad idea.
---
That's the most Rita Skeeter headline I've heard so the content of this must be absolute bullshit
---
Click click their portrait and click inspect
---
I did these quests in a 5 man, there were 2 other groups present. It was painful, funny, but painful.
---
Anybody who expected the game to fail after two weeks is just being silly. 
---
Let's look at it in 6 months to a year and see how the population is holding up.
---
It's going to be a success and will hopefully lead to future classic expansion servers (BC, LK)
---
What level were they? That's seriously not cool.
---
I agree with you.   Let people transfer one or two characters from the classic server to the BC server.  This way you have 2 toons at 60, and can level some from scratch if you choose.   Leveling to get to 60 wasn't bad in BC IIRC because they lowered the XP requirements
---
I'll clear my bags, go out on a skinning mission and by the time my bags are full of trash and the rest I'll head back, I was making 2-3g just off grey items
---
I don't find it bad.
---
Like you say you have good sustain and can solo even leveled elites with relative ease.
---
Your kill speed will pick up at 20 with SOC if you keep your weapon updated.
---
Garbo item
---
Those are not friends, rather people you know.  I'm guessing you go to school with them.
---
Stopping to rez randos is great, if they aren't afk they're always so grateful you saved them the run
---
what? where?
---
Source? Asking for a friend...
---
If you like trees you should check out r/MarijuanaEnthusiasts
---
Chloride got to stay on and Sodium got stuck in a queue. The quest mob popped up and you were DC'd :(
---
That's completely reportable. That being said,  just ignore your chat window for a bit and they'll shut up. I usually scroll mine up so i can't see any new messages. Eff those guys.
---
Where do you get 0.0% from?
---
Aren't transfers free now though
---
only ONE shield? you have a main hand slot for a reason. get a 2nd shield, asshole
---
Generally speaking, people who complain the most are those who know the least.
---
ie.: Those who know what they're talking about understand the source of the problem and know that, in this specific case, it's not Blizzard.
---
Or they consistently rolled so badly that everybody died.
---
thanks
---
My friend says in vanilla he didn't realize there was a tram so he, Rogue nelf, ran from wetlands to redridge, to duskwood....., to westfall... then elwynn to stormwind. Said he died tons. He was like lvl 10ish.
---
The have plenty of servers. Instead of opening new ones to xfer to they should have opened xfers to existing low/medium pop ones. I play on smolderweb during peak hours there is about 8k players both sides on. We hit a que one time but was less than 30. Easily have plenty of room for xfers  
---
The only reason I can think is for name purposes but those who xfered probably care more about their progress than their name anyway.
---
Had crowd pummler drop, melee dps rolled against me and won. Then mekgineers 2h dropped and he rolled again and won. How messed up is that? So now he got 2 2h weapons that were better than mine
---
Are you sure about that claim? Cause for other games I've seen Mac has like 10 times as many users as Linux. Which is still nothing compared to Windows, but much more than Linux.
---
Fair point.  I'll be sure to keep our titles more informative going forward. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Its decent for twinks &amp; leveling, Id say you might get 50g if someone REALLY wants it.
---
On my server someone has been listing it for the asinine price of 250g and of course nobody is buying it for that.
---
With all the unobtainables I lost interest in retail. I Will always feel like I lost and am behind.
---
If you take that quest but don't hand it in, you have a fun toy that you can make fluting noises with whenever you want.
---
There is no going back. I'd simply pick up a different game.
---
To be fair, drop rates on quest items are probably the most frustrating thing in the game while leveling. "OH, YOU MEAN THE BIRDS WHO CLEARLY HAVE BEAKS AREN'T ALLOWING ME TO RIP THEIR BEAKS OFF AFTER MURDERING THEM? COOL!"
---
But yeah, otherwise, the inconveniences are manageable.
---
What sucks is almost no xp while doing that
---
I'll hunt you to the ends of the earth if I have to! Do you hear me? To the ends of the earth!
---
A) If we apply this logic to the everything, then everyone puts everything at vendor price on the AH and there’s no more point farming anything or trying to corner a market. Everyone is complaining that the economy sucks right now and you purposely contribute to it...
---
B) You would probably sell just as well if you put them just below the other sellers. Right now you’re making like 10s per book after AH cut. That’s nothing.
---
This is pretty much the definition of gatekeeping, lol.
---
Newer players/ones that cant no life it shouldnt be completely fucked over.  Yes, players that put in more time should probably be able to get better things, but it shouldnt hinder newer/more casual players to the point where they cant get anything done.
---
Fk no.
---
I freaking love co-operation on pvp servers.
---
Once I was grinding mobs with my lvl ~50 female troll rogue, and a couple of female nightelves were also grinding mobs at the same location - we'd waved and stuff and were grinding together in peace.
---
Then a hunter came along and marked and murdered me, I guess that hunter felt confident against revenge with other alliance around because it stayed to kill mobs. After rezzing I stealthed up on the hunter and brutally murdered it while the two nightelfs watched impassively, the power of friendship being greater than factional allegiance. Then we all went back to grinding and the hunter didn't come back.
---
Edited my original comment since it came across as rude, my b.
---
Sit while drinking or just sitting?
---
ive known them all my life, i gotta go where the numbers are.  Its just annoying because that was our original plan but they were being pussies and didnt wanna play at launch
---
Only two if you're lucky.
---
Just making sure. You know drinking gives you mana back quick?
---
Sorry, Sodium is the slave, so it takes a second
---
No note editing a 4 monitor shot down to a tiny image! You sir are a god.
---
Honestly it’s all based off your group composition. Some groups I need to burn all my mana every pull and barely keep ppl alive. But if everyone in your group is appropriate level they’re all pretty easy to heal tbh. I honestly think healing is way more engaging in dungeons than dps’ing.
---
Damn. Ballzy to start your youtube carrier with a clickbait like that, but brave nonetheless.
---
My thoughts : 
---
\- The clickbait title could be better. There's a mix between present and future in the first part that make it sound weird, and it's a little too long with the "gives his thoughts" thing.
---
\- You've got a nice voice for commentary. The audio is pretty good throughout the video.
---
\- The way you describe your experience and opinions of the game seems like you should stream instead of being a "critic".
---
\-  "If you're not playing on a PVP server are even playing wow ?" with that tone makes you sound like a gatekeeping douche.
---
Just my thoughts
---
You are the one from my dreams
---
Life saver
---
I'm kinda itching to make a new character in retail and try to play it like classic, at least to try and gauge the differences. So no heirlooms, no dungeon finder, etc. 
---
Though I gotta admit, I probably won't be able to resist the mount until 40.
---
I am sniping twinks items for a few gold and going to resale in a few months for 10x the price is not 100x
---
Only from a few specific servers to a fixed destination.
---
Yeah last hitting for that spirit tap can be a really son of a bitch. Still working that out when I got something like a warlock in my party.
---
It's as bad as people make it out to be. Your rotation is pretty much just auto attacking and occassionally casting a seal and using judgment when you can. Its very simple and most people find it boring. I think it's a little better than warrior because you can keep yourself alive for a lot longer but it's not much better
---
This guy tanks.
---
Np. He's easy to miss, but also the star
---
Teh best post today.
---
In related news, getting to Ashenvale through Felwood from Moonglade as a 25 druid is NOT a shortcut for taking the free FP to Thunderbluff and then going back up through The Barrens.

I re-learned this the hard way... but I have the Felwood FP now!

Paying for Windows in 2019
---
Well, I've never played WoW before and I've only started this past week soooo...not yet? I do plan on giving retail a try, but I'm loving classic too much right now to take the time.
---
Get the pitchforks gang, we have a Windows user with a superiority complex!  Joking... A little.
---
Linux users have chosen this OS in preference to have additional security and privacy.  We have a right to do these things.  But thank you for stopping by.
---
Not sure then, maybe open a ticket with blizzard
---
It seems like pets can really mess up the aggro and leashing, I've had lots of times being chased to ends of earth where both me and my pet don't touch them but they seem to ping pong between us in threat somehow.
---
You’re forgetting dark shore is a 12-20 zone
---
The guilds who advertise themself as “hardcore” are equally as lame.
---
Druids can level straight Resto and quest easily. (You just use bear form and pop out when you need to heal.)
---
You will kill things much faster as another spec, but I’ve never really wanted to play the other specs.
---
Ran DM with guildies for the first time a few nights ago. Everyone but myself was over 50.
---
Are you mentally challenged? I would say the other word but reddit police retarded feeling might get hurt.
---
haha fair enough it's true.  my main use of the tram so far has been last thing before bed, quickly getting higher tier engineering stuff from IF before logging off in SW!
---
Codes still work? Do used codes work?
---
If I remember correctly, conjured items disappear if you're offline for 15 minutes.
---
I use the CensusClassic addon, so atleast for my faction (alliance) they should be pretty reliable.
---
Ugliest fucking ui
---
Only to a specific server that blizzard sets it to. Have a friend that wants to transfer to my server so we can play together. My server is low population, but it’s not an option for transfer unfortunately.
---
S
---
I feel a bit bad, but i havent logged on for a raid since Classic came out.
---
I guess my retail guild finally killed Azshara (normal, lol) and a couple of heroic bosses, but i just cant be bothered to log back on.
---
I did the tax and change in my head
---
I've seen an unopened Original CE for sale for $3500 on eBay.
---
You can definitely see Nessy swimming around in the water which I’m guessing would’ve been a raid boss at some point. How cool of a concept that would’ve been to come into fruition.
---
I saw so many good pallies that my fucking alt is going to be a pally. Once they can start aoe farming with the rec bomb shit becomes insane.
---
While I think they might open up transfers, I think they probably won't let people move to the highest population servers.
---
Letting people crowd into a high pop server is basically a good way to finish off any of the lower pop servers.
---
I mean with non brain dead tanks that now that shout is busted in 1.12 you can. Just bring real dps classes and you will be slamming dungeons.
---
Brilliant move just like diablo mobile right....
---
If you think you are OP against rogue, wait until lvl 40 with dire bear form. Just sit in that and maul him to death
---
I wouldn’t say 33% is within margin of error for something that is purely farming 2-3 items from 1-2 mobs. That’s quite a huge difference tbh. 33% more time. If starting from 0g that takes 7 additional hours to hit 100g...
---
Honestly doesn’t matter. You do enough healing fully specced shadow for all dungeons up until 60.
---
Don't unless they ask or unless they are dying. If fewer mobs are hitting them they are generating less rage, dealing less damage, putting out less threat.
---
Ah ok, saw i could do it so I assumed everyone could
---
So you don't have to even delete your warlock?
---
What's the point of the post
---
"The Gang goes to the Crossroads"
---
Toxic people being toxic to other people, who'd have thunk it.
---
Really?
---
Yeah, I've had good tanks in DPS spec with 2h.  Because they know how to LOS and do pulls methodically.
---
Found from an old post from a rogue using. 
---
https://github.com/ericraio/vanilla-wow-addons/tree/master/w/WeaponQuickSwap
---
This is what the macro looks like--- /script WeaponSwap("Skeletal Club", "Buzz Saw", "Big Bronze Knife", "Buzz Saw")
---
I use it for my rogue to equip dagger for ambush
---
RIP your gold then.
---
i havent met anyone who would regret playing mage. +for gnome mage is 5+int. in raids as shadowpriest you will hard time to get so you will be mostly asked to heal. in pvp priests are one of if not the strongest 1v1 class.
---
I'm more than willing to deal with a half baked story, it's fun for adventurers to roll with that.  So long as the dungeon is good ;)
---
*laughs in psychic*
---
Dinged 40 with only 32g. Farmed spiders in Arathi for silk, elementals in Arathi for charms, rock elementals in Badlands. Mobs in shimmering flats and Tanaris also drop trash which sell for a lot of silver.
---
To be fair to you, I both forgot entirely about the concept of "wands", and demon grimoires. For like.. 15 levels. Well, the demon grimoires was for 26 levels, if we're being honest here.
---
Thanks, have heard about this one and am sadly alliance!
---
It depends on who gets the drop on the other.  Highly skilled rogues will 100-0 to you without any chance to respond, especially without any pvp trinkets.

Maybe it’s because I’ve been more casual this time around, but I’ve found people in general to be more tolerable in 2019.  Barrens chat is arguably worse, but all of the groups have been much more patient than I remember in 2004.
---
Damn that’s really dope
---
Doesn't sap remove you from stealth unless talented as well?
---
Wouldn’t call it slow but it is damned dull.
---
Yeah 5 days of game time not necessarily 5 days. It's still a lot of commitment for some people. Only level 33 on my character. I'd be gutted to have to start again
---
Using Debian and this seems to be really working. There is only one thing that is worrying me: I hope that this kind of fix ins't bannable behavior in the eyes of Blizzard?
---
You think you do, and you still do, but maybe just a little different than you thought.
---
They took those slots from retiring the keyring and guess what we're getting back in one of the phases?
---
Yeah we know, was posted to this subreddit a few days ago
---
Traveled all the way to Dun Morogh just to tame one of the black boars. He's been stabled since level 23 when I got Humar, but brought him back out last night and will take him along on my solo adventures until 60. The fact that he's tough, eats *anything*, and has the best idle emote of any pet *ever*, makes him a pure winner - even if he can't hit as hard as other pet breeds.
---
Ty kind soul
---
Very Nice! By the way, what interface add-ons do you use? I loved your interface, it's just that I'm looking for.
---
typical, instead of making the game better everyone struggles to make it worse. We are our own worst enemy in this game.
---
Lmfao you're on an RP server and picked that name 😅
---
Ive personally never been in a group that wants to roll on locked chests
---
Restarted my phone, restarted my computer and it worked. I guess it was that simple...
---
It's also mentioned by name within WoW vanilla itself.
---
If you don't know things don't mention them and get offended when it's pointed out that you're wrong..
---
Honestly aoe farming cloth is your best bet. There's a nice chill spot in alterac that drops really good mageweave and silk in a lil farm just next to Lordamere lake (https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2246/syndicate-assassin)
---
I farmed there for 2-3 hours on a full pop server (whitemane) and only saw an occasional alliance player coming to do the quest thats nearby. The assassins are stealthed but once you learn their spawns its easy to predict where they are and the henchman stop and whirlwind a few times in place making them super easy to kite. I made around 30g and gained a full level in the process.
---
Vuhdu kinda does it for you. You just type in what spells you want under which clicks in the options tab. So for example if I left click someone’s portrait it uses heal, if I shift click it uses greater heal. Alt left click is dispel magic alt right click is abolish disease, and so on.
---
I definitely do agree with the idea that expansions never really combined itself with the older content, it just abandoned it. This just kept piling up over the years,Thats why classic is so comprehensive by itself, the economy is pretty consistent from 1-60 versus retail where gold for a standard mount/training can be achieved in seconds by a max level.
---
To be fair though, there wasnt really any other route blizzard could have taken, even in hindsight. Forcing players do to old content is not practical and just performing small incremental changes may not have been as lucrative/fun.
---
Good call...blizzard loves accounts with multiple strikes
---
Looking good!
---
You obviously can’t be told shut the fuck up
---
That's pretty shitty dude. Tanking when your new is already stressful enough. I don't exactly know a lot about classic warrior but I'll attempt to scrounge up something and hope I don't sound like an idiot.  
---
I see a lot of Warriors actually using Battle stance over Defensive for trash pulls as it gives you access to thunderclap without burning rage by switching from defensive, and threat is a bigger deal than the survivability. You might want a macro though for when your taking a lot of damage. Er, something along the lines of...  
---
 \#showtooltip Shield Block  
---
 /equip (one handed weapon name, shift click it with the macro window open)  
---
 /equip (shield name, same thing)  
---
 /cast \[stance:2,equipped:shields\] Shield Block; \[stance: 1/3\] Defensive Stance   
---
This should swap you from battle stance to defensive. Also if your groups heavy on melee Battle Shout is good threat generation. Else demoralizing shout is fine as well. Don't rely too much on Heroic Strike. It will rage starve you badly.   
---
Again this could actually all be complete garbage so if so disregard. Either way I wish you luck and don't let these people stop you from doing your part to help!
---
I recommend using judgement after most heals. Be efficient with your 5 sec rule. You can use 3 casts at the same time.
---
That rogue made very dumb mistakes, you would have been gone if it was me ;)
---
Impressive jump.  But I'd imagine only the bravest souls would dare to play Horde on a pvp server in the first place.  That must be rough.
---
No...  
---
Blizzard is true and loyal to their PC community.

(you guys have phones right ?)

Oh, huh, i'm glad you're on! I still am unable to connect using my regular tether sadly, so it looks like i'm stuck borrowing a friend's for today

Damn dude RIP your character if you really did, incoming ban.
---
Blink into the dead zone, nova hunter and pet.  Poly pet.  Cast a nuke on the hunter and then just kite him in his dead zone with instants.  It gets a bit trickier if the hunter has scatter shot.
---
Did you type a stutter? You typed a stutter. Have an upvote.

the only difference with army IT stuff is if it's designed to be "on the move" or "on the halt."  For when you have servers in the back of a truck.  They have to have shock absorbers and springs.  The drives have to be solid state.  Things like that.  So it's not even the computer parts that are tested to do this stuff.  It's the containers for the parts that are tested.

You know it’s classic when a war is using staff and leather head and no one writes about it
---
Exactly why I’m keeping the guy I have on Whitemane don’t mind the queue use it to do stuff before I sit down and play
---
You give him one.
---
To classic sure, but there are things with BC and WotLK that we’re largely considered to have ruined the atmosphere of the game, and flying mounts was one of them. It isn’t like classic where people overwhelmingly refused any changes. For people who would want it brought back, you are likely part of a minority that would want WotLK left exactly the same. Also you don’t have to be so smug.
---
I definitely heard a guys flute in the tram last week.
---
as a priest healer, every time i see a lock in group. i let him/her be, they only got a shield and hot, that's all xD
---
Yeh the other day we did it with tank on 22, me mage on 22, priest healer on 21, shaman on 20 and some other dps on 21 i think. We smashed everything up to last boss. I am fire but have the +6% hit from frost. I barely damaged the boss. We just couldnt take him down before the healer went oom.

Jealousy is a hell of a drug. I think we can all forgive you for it.
---
World PvP is almost always opportunistic, and rarely fair. You'll find a lot of people will jump you when you're already fighting a mob, generally because they need that advantage to win ;) Likely the same type of person who whines to their guild that you 'cheated' by popping a potion and negating their advantage! Personally I don't 'gank' like that unless I have prior beef with a player, because there's not really any challenge or sport in it.
---
Anyhoo, it's possible the Hunter was after you but I'm inclined to say he wasn't, because if so he could've hit you with a Concussive before you were in Charge range. Either way, certainly sounds like you caught him with his pants down.
---
During tbc, i was getting polymorph turtle in ZG with 3 pvp buddies. I tagged tiger by incident.
---
We killed it and it dropped swift zulian tiger but we had masterloot on (me) because i needed to loot the crocs for some reason.
---
We did a /roll after some guys were outbidden to pay every one not to roll.
---
Between every roll there was a pauze because every one was scared to lose
---
The first guy rolled 1, followed by a big fat *sigh*
---
The second guy rolled 85, imagine the yells on teamspeak
---
The third guy rolled 86, imagine the yells on teamspeak now...
---
I rolled 87, what, the, fuck.
---
The only thing on retail hurting me to leave behind is this mount with this story.
---
I should still have a screenshot of this on a harddrive somewhere.
---
What am I looking at?
---
Intimidation, hopefully not vs Orc...
---
Don't you toy with me!
---
Never liked them tbh
---
how much of the hour CD on your hearth did you have?
---
Lol don’t talk about stuff you have no idea about. There are countless videos online of how it should be.
---
(For leveling.)
---
We had a player named Anabolik in guild who was a trade chat troll. Some super clever person in trade called him anal-ball-lick. And he loved it. 
---
We even referenced back to it when we met up at comic-con 6 years later. He still loves it
---
I'm not saying that it a inherently bad strategy, especially if the healer can take it, but that's not exactly tanking. You guys were just running the dungeon with 4 dps.
---
I mean, of course you will generate lots of rage if you take *massive* damage, and that will make it easier to spam demo shout. 
---
However, don't expect every healer to be fully on board with your strategy, especially if what the group is asking is for a **tank**.
---
Nope.
---
What happens when you shatter combo? ( nova, fb, coc, coldsnap, nova, fb, coc)
---
The did so many things right with MoP. Tbh I loved the fresher setting anyway, but that was only one small thing that went so well imo. It remains my favorite expansion with my fondest memories.
---
Hmm. Well, true. 
---
Im probably going to level 55-60 in BRD to get an early start on loot. But people are probably not going the ‘aoe farm meta’ once they’re High enough level. I hope.
---
nice.
---
What frosty guild you refering to?
---
I'm not a PVPer by any means, but I couldn't imagine playing this game on anything but PVP servers. The threat of players adds so much to the world and alliance vs horde conflict.
---
I love it for the same examples you've given. Over the years I've had so many stories of one person ganking another, and then rallying the nearby players to go rough them up. And before you know it we've got a 30-minute battleground of sorts in the middle of the road right outside of a questing hub.
---
It's just so much fun. Yes getting ganked sucks. But people act like it's the end of the world. 95% of the time you get ganked and that's it. It's a couple minute walk back to your body. Most people won't camp you because they have better shit to do. I've been playing this game since 2005 and I can count on one hand the number of times I've been camped on a PVP server.
---
Not everybody is out for blood. And even if you get camped, you can take 30 minutes to log out, go take the dog for a walk, get food, go to the bathroom, whatever. By the time you get back the camper will have gotten impatient waiting on you to respawn and moved on.
---
Play PVP servers. They're so much more interesting.
---
&gt;assed on it because of 
---
I was in a group the other day where a mage rolled need and won the Cruel Barb because "mages are able to equip swords." He then proceeded to call the people complaining about his roll "cucks" and then won the roll for cookies Stirring Rod before hearthing out.
---
that's why the Pizza timer exists xD
---
1) The person I responded to was apparently calling out their same faction players for ganking people on a PvP server. Not getting ganked. If you're bothered by other people ganking other people then maybe a PvP server isn't for you. I don't get why this should be taken as an insult either - there's nothing that makes you "better" because you like everything that comes with a PvP server. It's just a preference. 
---
2) I have zero issue with skulls ganking. It does get silly when it devolves into long term camping, but again, just log to an alt for awhile and wait for them to go away. It's part of the experience, and part of the satisfaction of progressing along in classic is the struggle along the way. IMO. I might get frustrated or annoyed by a skull ganking me, especially multiple times, but at the end of the day I have no problem with it.
---
Enjoy the game?! WoW is not for fun.
---
Love it when they delete their account after this
---
So happy someone clipped my massive fail! literal perfect timing
---
This only from glancing at wowhead but it seems raptors have the best vendor trash loot.
---
Warlocks also laugh at food/water, questing using mostly dots and wand.
---
Ya know, unpopular opinion...
---
But if people played like they do in classic in modern wow it wouldnt be so bad.. blizzard gave us shortcuts, everyone takes them and complains about x,y,z.
---
After playing classic the last two weeks or whatever it's been and going back to retail to level a new character today for an hour..
---
 it's not the game that's bad, it's the people.
---
burning crusade and wrath were the cats tits, cata is where it went downhill, toward the end of cata the game was unplayable
---
Yea, I gotcha 😉
---
At least least you're not as dumb as the guy I met the other day who was still using his level 1 spells at level 10.
---
Dont run software off a USB drive.
---
The argument that anytime you repeat an entertainment experience then it is only because of nostalgia, is only an argument that comes up when talking about video games. Also covertly tucked into the accusation, is the assumption that old video games are not worth playing these days.
---
When people go to baseball games, is this only because of nostalgia? Considering most people played baseball as kids, it's probably a component. But baseball is also a sustainable billion dollar business. At what point does it become something other than nostalgia?
---
How about movies? When I rewatch Avengers Endgame for the 5th time is that only because of nostalgia? Can you be nostalgic for something that happened six months ago? What about when I rewatch the Wizard of Oz? That came out before most people were born. Are we just being nostalgic for the 1930s?
---
When people beat Dark Souls and immediately repeat the game on NG+, are they just being nostalgic? Can it be nostalgia if there is no time gap between experience one and experience two?
---
Anytime you do something for the second time you will have memories of doing it the first time so you can say there are elements of nostalgia. The charge is unavoidable. Yet people do things more than once, all the time. People flocked to vanilla on private servers and have been playing it for years.
---
At what point is it something other than nostalgia? Can old video games be fun in and of themselves? Does art and entertainment only have intrinsic value if it is brand new?
---
How? I have to config it?
---
Yes, that is an issue. But that doesn't mean no one talks.
---
\[Interlaced Cowl\] ftw
---
Don't forget to roll need on every weapon y'all. Live up to the hunter legacy. :D

31 Warlock LFG Guild to raid with on Myzrael - 
---
I raided in classic from MC all the way through AQ40. I'm older now with a family so I can't commit as much time as I used to however I plan to raid 2-3 nights a week. I can't raid until 6-7pm PST so looking for a guild that has a schedule that fits for me. I am good at this game I played it for a long time and know the fights well.
---
Do you play well, do you have a good stuff with a bit of spell damage? do you wash your hands after picking your nose? who knows?
---
Honestly it's the leveling phase. You shouldn't judge how well you're doing with comparing damage in a dungeon, this shit is for max level.
---
Yes of course but also you are not giving away your real character name.
---
I saw someone with epic riding last night. That's the real wtf.
---
Thanks for putting me in place fellas. Reminds me i have work to do :) 
---
Have a great week!
---
Like not even $1. It's $15 for 30 days, so $0.50/day, and half a day = $0.25.  
---
&gt; Sure thing, where would you like your ~~$1~~ quarter deposited sir?
---
Ya cheeky son of a heck!
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99994% sure that Land2600 is not a bot.

I think people remember the Paladin being boring, the play style is not very engaging.  This probably makes Paladins *seem* slower, when in reality, they’re closer to the middle of the pack.

so where do you put this macro in?    in game?   or on your keyboard?
---
&gt; If someone drops to 30% mid fight I'll generally need to heal them before something kills them.
---
No. Warlocks have healthstones and drain life.
---
It’s very mob dependent make sure you dot all the mobs and you will only see a jump in dps when you get shadowform but then you’ll be ostracized from group lose lose situation
---
I still see a majority of servers either Full or High still every night, don't think the nostalgia is wearing off yet.  I wasn't on retail to begin with, so until the next xpac is out to try, it's all Classic forward for me.  As stated, I can't wait to get home and level each night.  So many fun and interesting interactions in an MMO that I haven't had in a very long time.
---
It has massively for me on razorgore. Queue was 4-6k at peak and now its 100-200
---
It is impossible to hit exalted with any race rep in Classic without doing cloth turn-ins.  The reputation numbers are not there.
---
The hearthstone cast uses the same animation/color as nature magic if I recall (pun unintended) correctly.
---
Ex-WoD, I feel the same way.  Grouped with someone to grind through a quest area, went our separate ways, and the met them again 2 days later.  That never happened with live, everybody was a stranger.
---
I've also been giving (and gotten) random green drops to randos I pass if it's an upgrade.  That has literally never happened since vanilla.  Ever.
---
There's a sense of social camaraderie in classic that isn't in live servers any more.
---
That would have been awesome
---
I’ve been at the beach all weekend, and all I can think about is going back home to keep leveling my priest. Four more hours haha
---
That's not how you upvote
---
Silk isn't even all too hard to get. Just doing casual questing and grinding, I've probably already sold off 3 or 4 stacks by level 31. Also undercutting is just how an auction system work. Do they not realize how capitalism works?
---
Yes.

---
#####Newly formed guild recruiting players of all skill levels interested in a casual raiding experience and having friendly people to play Classic with.
---
***
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
**&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** is a North American based Alliance casual raiding guild occupying the Pagle (PvE) server. As a guild, we look to maintain a focus on understanding and supporting your guild mates as we all traverse Classic raiding together.&amp;nbsp;    
---
Some of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and gaming buddies!).&amp;nbsp;    
---
If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#☄️ What we look for in members ☄️
---
* Mature individuals who are willing to be kind and understanding of each other in order to create a comfortable guild environment.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Players who are looking to clear raid content, but don't want to push themselves for server first.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Social members who are ready to hang out and run some dungeons or chill out on the Minecraft server. We want Classic to be what we all have in common, but make friends for other games here too!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Members that will be proud to be a part of **&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** and care about the reputation of the guild they belong to.
---
#📜 Requirements and Rules 📜
---
* You are required to listen in on Discord during raid time. We also ask that you have a functioning microphone and that you either use a well configured noise gate or use Push-to-Talk instead.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Show up to raid with a good attitude. This includes patience for newer vanilla players and a strong willingness to learn!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Be kind to those around you, both in and out of the guild. We care about our reputation as a guild, and we expect you to as well!
---
#📅 Guild Events 📅
---
**Post Launch:** At the current moment, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.
---
#⚔️ [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) ⚔️
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 9:00pm - 12:00am Eastern Standard Time (EST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 12th (we will re-evalute as necessary). Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This should give members enough time to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing! Roles are first come, first serve as we establish the guild. We are currently recruiting all positions and classes __besides tanking__.**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 14 Melee Damage, and 14 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
The loot system is a rotating loot council comprised of the Guild Master, a selection of two random officers, and two random guild members. The piece will be awarded to the guild member who the council believes will make the biggest impact on our progression. Be ready to put the guild before your ego! You will get pieces, I promise.
---
That about sums it up! Below is a link to our application, again. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, message me, or find me on Discord at **Marotheit#7401**. We hope to see you soon!&amp;nbsp;

Do you know any place pre-40 that i can farm for my mount?? I’ll edit my post. Thank you for your answer. I’ll def check it when i hit 60.
---
Tried it after the last stress test while waiting for the launch. Found it extremely unsatisfying.
---
I agree it's a dirty tactic. I tried using auctionator, way too complicated for me.
---
Excuse me its 2019! You can not identify as horde or alliance! not male or female. Grow up sir
---
Levels and items. I've been more excited over green upgrades with half of the stats I don't even need, and 8-slot bags, than anything from Retail in years.
---
I think he's a little confused. Many of Blizzard's products prominently display Windows/Mac support.
---
As for other games...yes we all know it's mostly Windows. But Mac support is there. Linux support, well heh yup...
---
Although the profits aren't huge, I've made a fair bit of money buying cheap linen on The ah and turning it into bags which I either vendor or auction depending on what they're going for at the time. Typically make between 50c and 1s per bag. It's a shame the same doesn't really work for wool or higher.
---
Some usefull addons that will help you a lot in wow classic:
---
Vendor Price- In classic, you cannot see how much gold/silver/copper an item is worth when you mouseover it in your bags. 
---
ClassicCastBars- Again in classic you cannot see the cast bar of an enemy when he is casting. Super usefull to know when you can interrupt a spell or in general know what is happening.
---
ClassicAuraDurations- You cannot see, when you apply a DOT ( Damage over Time) on your target how long it lasts. Usefull to be able to see that so you can reapply it for example.
---
Questie- Absolutely mandatory unless you want to spent months till you reach lvl60. It basically shows you on the map where quests are and where current quest objectives are to know where to go and not read the quest and search like crazy to find.
---
Bartender: You can change and move your skills bars how you like and make your own unique UI. (not necessary)
---
There are a couple more, but im at work and cant think of them, but those are rly nice to have.
---
A couple of tips while you start your adventure in this amazing game.
---
I saw in the comments below that you are going to play a mage. First of all great choice. An amazing DPS in dungeons and raids and an amazing pvp class. Note that 15 years ago people didnt know how strong some classes are and didnt have the experience that we all veterans have atm, thats why you will see a lot of mages and rogues, which might reduce the changes some times in dungeons or raids to get loot cause you will have a lot of mages in them. 
---
I would take skinning and tailoring. With skinning you will skin a lot of leathers from beasts you will kill and you can vendor those skins to make some money while you lvl up. Tailoring is amazing for cloth classes and you can make your own cloths, this is very important cause getting good gear is not always the case and having a profession where you can make items for yourself or for others to sell is always usefull. You can later remove skinning if you dont want it anymore and lvl up enchanting for example when you have more gold and are experienced with the game. Enchanting is imo for a begginer plus for a fresh char not a very good idea, cause all those green and blue items you will disenchant means you loose a lot of money rather than vendoring them, which means less money to buy skills and eventually the mount. 
---
Mount is needed and try to save money to buy it as soon as possible. As a mage your only mobility skill is blink and since the game has you travel so much you need a mount to move fast.
---
Buy only skills that are only going to be at the moment usefull, they are expensive and you will find yourself loosing a lot of money for spells that you wont use very often. Buy them later when you have the gold.  
---
Mages are great for aoe grinding. At around lvl20 you start to get the good aoe spells. Check a video guide on how to do that. You will earn a lot of gold and experience and you will definetly have fun with that.
---
Watch some videos for talents to get an idea. Try not to make a mistake cause relearning talents costs gold and its not something you want to spent for at the early stages.
---
I guess the last thing is to tell you to take your time and enjoy the game.

Birds of a Feather is a guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. 
---
🕊🕊🕊🕊
---
We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years. What we are looking for: Someone who is dedicated. We require 80% attendance otherwise you may be subbed out. We understand things happen but just don’t make a habit of it.

🐧🐧🐧🐧

We are recruiting someone who can raid on 🕖 Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 7PM EST to 10PM EST 🕙, with a good attitude, is mature, is willing to help others, and is willing to learn and ask questions. We aim to start raiding on October 1st.
---
🦃🦃🦃🦃
---
How we operate: As stated above we will be raiding two days a week from 🕖 7-10PM EST on Tuesday and Thursday 🕙. As for loot we will be running 🏛 Loot Council 🏛. The team will decide how to distribute loot based on several factors including (but not limited to): Attendance, performance in raids (Moreso your ability to listen and do mechanics as opposed to pulling high numbers.), what you contribute to the guild (helping other players, crafting/enchanting things for people, etc.), and just helping the guild in general.
---
🦅🦅🦅🦅
---
What we are recruiting for raids: We are still fine tuning our raid roster, and as such applications from all experienced raiders are encouraged!

I would pair the respective crafting with the gathering profession, to be honest
---
Probably the groups of 3 mages a healer and me that expect me to hold Afro against aoe 1s into a fight good times lol.
---
Bloq num on/off gang
---
I think it would be very long and lonely. The best part about Classic is that the leveling areas are full. Example: 
---
You can do DM very quickly. If you did Dungeon Finder for DM you would be in a group full of heirlooms. If you tried to find a PUG in your server it would take forever to find one!
---
LAWL.  
---
im just writing its a tactic... and im talking about your post not others.  
---
Yet there you are with another cry post.  
---
k thx bye
---
Damn, I wish the game were new to me like that. I had so much fun discovering the world, and that feeling when seeing mere level 25 stuff that seemed like unfathomable power. Guildmates linking loot with stats beyond +10 and all of us drooling.
---
It's absolutely insane the number of people that won't do anything except META runs with 3 mages, or shamans and warriors, etc. They spam LFG and would rather look for half an hour for a third mage than dare to attempt a run with any other class.
---
Also annoying are the people looking for only levels on the higher end of the spectrum in order to complete a dungeon. "NEED DPS SM CATH, LEVEL 39+," or "HEALER NEEDED FOR SM ARMORY, LEVEL 36+ PLEASE" while I'm out here farming cath with levels 35-37 in around 20 minutes. 
---
Both of these are definitely not in the spirit of Classic. Wish these people would all find each other in a "META ONLY" guild and stop spamming LFG.
---
The anti-Keanu Reeves.
---
Sounds like your back peddling. This post is obviously 100% serious.
---
If they were smart they would use the hype generated by classic to slow down retails development and fix it but I doubt that blizzard is capable of thinking that far ahead these days
---
https://imgur.com/knxYAVE
---
Also nowhere near as good as Undead.
---
Not for the first year and a half, and even then, there was a 6-month cooldown. I'd be alright with that, as long as you can't server hop at will. Also, true Vanilla means no name or faction changes.
---
PUGs working already?damn
---
TSM? Sorry, I’m not super up on the mod lingo.
---
oh really?    i didnt know this.     so i can stay as a DPS while i level?
---
Are you 11?
---
Well yea, and I don't mean to be cruel but its like people in the 80s thinking laserdisk would take over and be great and in the end no one used it for one reason or another. Ignoring and abusing are 2 different things, as far as blizzard and other companies are concerned it doesn't matter what the community does linux is still not official supported by them and that is all that matters. It took most companies like a decade to accept people gamed on Mac and many more years to get things to work on it. I think its also a bit of a stereotype that only nerds and business databases/IT people use Linux not "normal consumers."

It’s just has to be muscle memory. Also people use the back button(which is slow)instead of straffing or using mouse.

I was wondering if this was going to happen lol.

Didnt work, cant log into the mobile app aswell without the home wifi, apparently other people are experiencing this aswell, the thing is i dont see blizzard addressing the issue anywhere
---
Do what you want... Shouldnt feel guilty about something youve paid to play.
---
Wing clip, conc shot, kite, swapping into aspect of the cheetah to get range on melee that can't daze you, bombs, FD/trap.
---
It's all about kiting them, if you let them get into melee and can't wing clip to get away then you're screwed. Kiting is like, the whole point of the class.
---
Wait. What has spitroasting to do with barbeque? I was talking about movies.
---
uhhh i wish. ive played on pvp servers for too fucking long, and nahh that never happens. how it plays out is this: get ganked by some1 with a huge level advantage while you have a mob aggroed...and the story ends there. run back to corpse and hope the guy was just passing through and not camping.
---
Oh god that quest. So not worth it lol. I tried for about 1 hour before just giving it up.
---
Hmmm, I was actually wondering that the other day - using Elvui, and haven't seen it. Anyone know how to enable it?
---
I bound mark skull onto a key, makes I reaaaaaal clear what I'm expecting does to be hitting so I can build threat on the rest
---
"fatigue" once you get i to deep water you get s fatigue meter. It functions the same as the breath meter when you go under water.
---
When the meter runs out you take damage then die.
---
the merer goes away when you return to the shallows.
---
Lol yeah dude I’m a red maga bro nazi for not wanting people who don’t interact with the community and just flame all the time (see: dota 2). People are too obsessed with politics. I’m talking about wow
---
i mean, its not as far as you can go from sounding like "anus". you can call yourself "wall" and no one will say you sound like "anus"
---
Can confirm. Recently quit a sick iron man acc to play wow as my only game (exception tears of guthix once a week lol).
---
People can see you holding it when it's equipped.
---
my brother SWEARS that simply logging out and in resets the drop rate some how. Every time he does log out and comes back in he magically gets his quest item from the next mob. I've been chalking it up to coincidence.... but I think he may be on to something haha
---
Happened all the time in vanilla

You both act childish.
---
Maybe you can both go play BfA ? :)
---
Also its been years since i've played but I believe you can also either press ctrl+z or alt+z to turn off the hud for a more full framed picture if you're going for something artsy.
---
you dont need a dungeon but you make lots of gold in dungeons. RFD
---
What is layering??
---
Sure, ZG (and AQ20 to a lesser degree) did work as a decent catch up mechanic but it's still a requirement that you raid. For PvP the difference between a guy in dungeon gear and a tier 3 character is just massive, so in that sense TBC fixed that with resilience, which is the route they'd have to go if they kept releasing post tier 3 content.
---
The paladin is my favorite because *he's trying really hard to do his best, okay!*
---
Wait till you get the shoulder and helm from Herod. Looks so badass.

---
You're not being judgemental, as that implies conclusion based on evidence, you're being prejudicial. You're drawing a biased conclusion based on no apparent facts and just presumptions.  
---
I tend to sometimes get attached to npc's in-game, but it is only an ode to storywriting/storytelling, not an actual relationship. Any mentally healthy person can tell the difference between real and virtual "relationships".  
---
I care about my character, I care about my character progression and I see it as my persona inside the world, but I know to differentiate in-game to real life, and I feel most people do. The fact you don't consider this while judging others, makes me think you yourself are struggling with differentiating, and are only confirming your "normalness" to yourself by putting down others that you deem "not normal".

How playing alliance feels like in every contested zone
---
it's a keybind, numlock by default
---
How and where do you setup the WASD in big screen? can you screen shot that I only get to a default where I can't move... Or I need to hold down the steam logo to get my custom screen. and really hard to config with no controller. half screen I can't slect with the mouse pointer...
---
While I'm an older gamer who loves the ease of solo play in retail too much to leave, I am really glad that so many people are getting so much out of Classic now.
---
I don’t see almost Anybody talking about difficulty. The amount of knowledge out there, mixed with the increase in player skill, makes the game incredibly easy in comparison to how it used to be. Also I’m sure there’s “rose-tinted goggles” about how hard it used to be, and it’s become legend now. 
---
Yeah maybe he is talking to the trolls, but I think most people are determined to hit 40 or 60. So yeah we will see how big the servers are in 6mo when most of the people are 60
---
nice legs xD
---
I would wait it out a little longer.
---
People are probably waiting to see how many transfer off the full servers to see if the queue reduces there, some groups may be getting ready to transfer over since it’s still staying full enough for queues.
---
Sounds like his plan worked - you got pissed off.
---
My simple solution. Keep everyone level 60. Release TBC and Wrath but with scaled-down / revamped loot that keeps it on par with Naxx. Put in the MOP Talent Trees ontop of the WOTLK talent trees. So, you receive passives as you level up but every 15 levels you get a new active skill to help your playstyle. The easiest way to make the game feel completely fresh with minimal effort. 
---
BUT, that depends what Blizzard sees Classic as. Is it to preserve history or is it a new game? That's the difference between going through TBC -&gt; WOTLK -&gt; Cata again or forging a new path. Considering how mad everyone is at BFA, It will be tough for Activision to sell us on new content that's free from predatory practices.
---
Finally just got my mount at 44 haha
---
I mean, I'm level 50 with 200G mostly from skinning. It's not inconceivable I'd be able to get the rest from the rate I'm selling leather.
---
That was beautiful

I'm looking for level partners! I have a level 21 mage. I've been questing around Lakeshire but I'm also happy to explore other zones (including Ashenvale, if anyone has the desire). 
---
I'm in EST and would like to be off by around 1 or 2AM, but I can start any time from the late afternoon onwards. It doesn't have to be a marathon - I'm just as fine with going slow and taking breaks as I am with knocking out like eight quest objectives before heading back. 
---
No pressure. :) I'm pretty chill. I'm happy to chat but it's also fine if you're not.

LMK if you're up for it!

I just imagine that undead warlock from the first wow trailer burning the forest around him.. then pausing the advance of flames for a moment while he picks up a silverleaf, carefully places it in his herb sack, and then nukes the spot where it was growing.
---
No one will ever know or care tbh. I recommend shadow until max level to be honest to make the leveling grind easier.
---
hahaha oh god we've all been there
---
This is false. The various ranks of hamstring reduce speed more making pvp easier. The higher ranks of demoralizing shout reduce more AP. To scale with monsters as they level. After 40 you should train skills so you never have to worry about it. With that said it shouldn’t be done until after mount.
---
Yo iddqd! Love your OW stuff! Congrats on the mount. :)
---
WoW Classic but with graphics like this.
---
are you ok
---
It has a few but nothing intrusive. It’s more of a graphical overhaul but it’s easy to drop any other addons into it if you wish.
---
Til. I always had to edit my images. Now I won't have to.
---
!RememberMe "1 day"
---
I disagree. The realm forums and Discord servers are a great way to call out ninja looters and scammers. Do it enough times or on a rare enough item and people will remember. Being able to pay a few bucks to make it go away leaves little necessity to act decent.
---
Just to be clear, I'm not talking about infamy via DK's, corpse camping, etc. I'm talking about those few that benefit unfairly at the expense of others' efforts.
---
TBC is by far my favourite expansion. Played private server on vanilla tbc and wotlk and i must say tbc is just so good.
---
So are they tunneling ping through an established client connection.? 
---
Otherwise It would seem that if they’re pinging your IP they would get a response from your router/firewall if any response at all (Unless you’re a genuine mad lad and have no router/firewall). I block ICMP at my edge so pinging my public IP will result in nothing but timeouts . 
---
Also, this doesn’t seem to be a reliable method of detection. I run several ‘nix boxes of varied distressed and all of them are coming up with a 64 hop TTL.  So YMMV if this is actually how their doing it.
---
Silverpine I guess...
---
Have my upvote. The overwhelming majority of negative interactions I’ve had have been from people from retail.
---
Tip for even veteran players:  The Tram is always faster than flying to Ironforge, and it's free, too!
---
WTF the first comment as well...
---
Friendly much People are.
---
What a dck move by the Warlock. Just not ever help him again. Be it in a raid or in the world. Just don't touch him at all
---
Why do you want to play pve? I'm not saying its a worse choice over pvp, i'm just curious. Most people prefer pvp.
---
Probably more likely that the new guys to his guild/group left their old guild because they had people playing classic and weren't able to get enough for raids anymore.
---
They don't have very good race specific priest spells. I don't think it'd really matter in the long run though.
---
Yea. I figured that aoe wasn't viable, I just didn't know if there was any tricks that could make it work. I always get worried bout fear juggling, I always feel like they will run into a group of mobs and pull them too. Guess ill have to watch a video on how to do it effectively
---
no
---
They weather effects are still in game and look as good as ever.
---
Yeah, retail has pruned everything into tight boxes. Basically every healer is a hybrid class in classic.
---
The irony is that even in retail a good pure healer is dpsing.
---
Me and my brother put wow.exe in our non steam games library. Installed steam link on our phone and connected to our pc while on the same network. After that we've been able to log on at work to do simple quests, grinding, and profession stuff.
---
Honestly it's been awesome to have open at work to peak down once in awhile and pick a flower, or catch a fish. Lunch times are great too!
---
Me and him are actually talking about making an add-on for better mobile controls and ui.
---
I mean you just did it too. And duskwood is like that if you don’t run back and forth to wetlands. 
---
My advice find a group for it and have fun
---
I'm not arguing with anyone. Your behavior just reminds me of an adolescent or someone with an underdeveloped capability to handle simple mental strain, like for example, understanding why one would be frustrated with using the AH functionalities to waste people's time and rip off newer players.
---
I've observed that on RP realms the majority people get pissed for rolling need on items you don't equip. I don't think RP'ers are naturally practically minded.
---
Yeah I think it may also have to do with the fact that I would imagine a good chunk of the server pop is now questing in those 30 - 40 areas like STV. so it's just super crowded.
---
I went to STV at 31 to farm trolls for the warrior quest. first night I only got killed maybe 3 times. otherwise I was left alone. just a whole lot of waiting for mobs to spawn and getting lucky enough to tag one.
---
The second night when I went to finish up. it was nuts. there were several groups of horde killing anything in sight. I had to leave and come back. but I did finish. went back yesterday to do some actual questing and it was just impossible. Horde everywhere. I spent two-hours fighting horde rather than questing lol. it was fun but I didn't have much progress to show for it.
---
Instance servers held strong for quite some time. :)
---
Yeah, just don't make it too obvious or stupid. This was a chase through the sewers at level 3 and the guy running was critically hit twice with crossbows, as well.
---
Pvp can be easily sought out once BGs are added, if you don't want to get ganked and do your own ganking out in the world then roll on a pve server
---
Fair enough amigo, you have a good one!
---
We're gonna need to see that one.
---
The only fun in wow i had and still have in bfa is GOLD. GLORIOUS PILES AND PILES OF GOLD
---
It hasn't been removed. People are stupid and spread false information
---
It looks cool
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
Same, and once you know how to save and double up on quests it gets better. There are still some annoying run backs, harpies anyone?, but I think it’s a pretty good zone.
---
Wtf are you talking about
---
You could just try to be the one initating conversation. Some people will gladly take it, others will keep beeing mute. 
---
I experience kinda the same in Classic, tho. I had dungeon visits where barely anyone said anything.
---
I was born feral, deal with it.
---
It’s because the botnet is made of IoT devices. Which usually run Linux.
---
I say some crude shit and don’t get banned that comes as a surprise

Idk how much my 5min pali buffs help but I typically try to get everyone I come across excluding quest hubs cause theres a lot of people usually.

EIGHT DAYS IN THE WEEK BECAUSE I GO TWICE AS HARD ON SUNDAY LOL UPDOOTS TO THE LEFT111
---
Peggle Classic because peggle is good.
---
True thanks for correcting me. She was a Herbs, Food &amp; Something Vendor.
---
yeah, I get that, but when I strafe and move I seem to still get hit as often as I dont. Does this tactic actually work in classic?
---
Why not? A game developer in the late 90's/early 2000's definitely had a decent Compaq or Thinkpad.
---
That isn’t the issue. The issue is the run to Ironforge takes forever, level 20 or not.
---
Basically NEs are not supposed to meet up with everyone else until like level 30 because that’s how they have them mapped out.  It’s really strange TBH.  Darnassus should have a portal to SW IMO.
---
because 5% AH fee? 
---
Let's take OPs example.
---
Book costs 90s to buy from Vendor. I guess it was listed as 1G then (5s Ah fee, 5s profit). If I buy it for 1G from him via AH, then putting the price at 1G10s nets me even less than 5s profit, so I need to sell it for a minimum of 1g15 to not have the same crappy margins as OP was criticed for.
---
OP could easily put it as 1G10s, make 15s profit and still undercut me. and since it's a vendor item it can be done endlessly.
---
But then again, supply and demand and all that. There's also the risk of buying too many and the market stopping to need them/people stopping to buy them from AH as well as the sunk gold in the books that now sit in your inventory rather than paying for your mount.
---
Yes that is exact. This is why this little trick is most efficient if done by a drood.
---
Not part of the Alliance. They are/were a city state who supported the Alliance against many threats, including the horde.
---
here is my ultimate point - its not hard to *not* block attempts from linux users from developing their own methods to achieve compatibility. in fact with proton it barely takes more than making sure some settings are correct to have your game work on linux via proton. 
---
linux users are used to making their own path towars their goal, leave us alone and we'll be just fine with out own homemade solutions but dont simply pretend we dont exist.
---
Let's all take a moment to talk about Chris Leals rogue name
---
There is 2 ways up to the arena. And then the way to baelgur (big giant). Or via fire ele boss.
---
I however also remember different ways in the grim guzzler tavern. To get through the door. Ways that ain't in classic. But that could be just my mind playing tricks.
---
The quest writer prabably could not figure it out either.  I'm sure he was was running out of ways to say go grind more mobs.
---
I'm aware of Linux, it's just hardly better for WoW. 
---
It's not officially supported and because of that Linux users have been unable to connect for the past 12 hours and are in the dark from Blizzard because there is no official support.
---
Speak for yourself, this is an awesome yet situational buff, I can only survive 2 fights underwater before needing breath
---
In cath I’ve gotten 80k exp a hour. Lib was around 50k
---
I am going to say yes, they are.
---
They add so much utility, and streamline your game play so much. You absolutely can do everything manually, but I honestly think you are doing yourself a disservice by not using them.
---
Having a Taunt macro that will cast defensive stance and taunt your mouse-over target, saves you 3 clicks button presses and saves you from having to potentially miss an attack on your active target.  That is just one example.
---
I think macros are one of the easiest means of game knowledge as skill expression.
---
I “did” stocks yday as 23 tank. 
---
Started with sword spec at only 50, and ended with the last boss lvl 29 who two shotted me. 
---
Me were a bit low, so we didn’t manage to kill him as respawns happened.
---
Yeah mate!
---
I’ve been cruising and stomping as a Retadin and pulling aggro the entire time from my warrior tank friend.
---
I love this game!
---
You want the slowest weapon possible. Damage from your non-auto attacks is based off the raw damage amounts, so a weapon with the same DPS but a much slower swing rate will do more damage overall than a much faster weapon.
---
Why sadly? If post 60 is more fun for me why do you care?
---
Inferior to exp per hour?
---
I mean I’m the grand scheme of things, classic is easy enough that it doesn’t matter. But the NE priest racials just aren’t nearly as good as dwarf or even human.
---
Strats that have been there for 15 years already...
---
All those first impression and guide videos...
---
Haha that would be perfect. Immediately gets out of character too and skips over to it. Then starts laughing evilly again, burning the entire forest.
---
&gt; last 10 years of gaming combined
---
Holy hyperbole batman, you mean to say over the last 10 years combined you're literally not enjoyed it - the total amassing of all the fun you had - as much as the past two weeks in WoW?
---
Using macros is optimal, but you don't have to use them.
---
Just have a look at Wowhead for some macro examples. You may not realize how helpful some are. As an example, you can:
---
&gt; Intercept/Charge: 
---
&gt; It either charges/intercepts, or puts you into the correct stance, another click and you charge/intercept. It will also leave you in zerker while in combat...
---
&gt;     /cast [nocombat,stance:1] Charge; [combat,nostance:3] Berserker Stance; [nocombat,nostance:1] Battle Stance; [combat,stance:3] Intercept
---
&gt; Any chance you could add the ability to dynamically filter the graphs?
---
Yeah, that's one point on my todo-list for the next days if I can spare some time after work this week.
---
Do you know if there's an easy way to cancel shooting apart from moving? Would love to just be able to hit heal in the middle of shooting without having to manually cancel the shoot first.
---
Most Warriors roll Orc- Orc get extra 5 points in aces which makes them miss less.
---
I'm using a cat myself. It dies alot if I'm not the same lvl as the monster. I'm thinking about swapping in a tank pet. Petopia has a graph showing pets plus/minuses for atk/hp/def
---
You need a break from the Internet, sir, and self reflect with your life choices.
---
the weird part about your entire tirade (and your posts defending it as such) is no ones attacking asmon, I think he's a fine enough dude and glad he found what makes him happy.
---
If you read my post without the vitriol worshipping you've got injected in your veins you'd notice all I'm calling out is (and its streamer agnostic, btw) that someone, *ANYONE* hitting 60 shouldn't be this celebrated.
---
That's all my dude, glad your life is fine.
---
I have a horde alt that I level only with friends. It will take quite some time but eventually she'll get to appropriate level and I, as classic-alliance main, can read ;)
---
Once you start using macros you'll see them as just another button. I hate messing with my UI too much but macros will 100% make your life easier. Even if it's just one to use certain things as they come off cooldown.

Yeah greenshot is the ultimate solution here IMO. Especially against the excuse that people using imgur app can just instantly post a picture taken with their phone.
---
With greenshot you can do fullscreen or "snippit" style screen shots and have them automatically save to your chosen location and also have them automatically upload to your chosen picture hosting site. Honestly works like a charm.
---
Id give it a little time. With the DDoS happenings all weekend server pops were down all over. 
---
They also did something with layering as there were so many people around on Rattlegore that I could barely get any quests done both Sat and Sunday due to zones being way over populated. Might as well been a 40 man raid group in DM, not a single NPC alive all the way to the instance portal both times I went in.

No you’re breathtaking!

You started arguing with me, when you made your first reply to my comment.

&gt; AH functionalities to waste people's time and rip off newer players. 
---
Its not wasting time, nor is it ripping off newer players.  
---
The low start bid is to list the auction more on top, or to make it more attractive to bid on.  
---
If nobody did bid on it, the original seller of the item can cancel the action, to prevent it from being sold on the last second for 1c.... this is an in game functionality.  
---
Its just to bad you didn't get the auction for the low price you wanted it for.  
---
This is not in this universe or any other universe wasting somebodies time or ripping new players off.

I’d feel guilty scamming noobs who don’t know those bags are cheaper at a vendor. I would say good on you like I would to the robe guy but this is different, shame on you.

2 gold for a quest? I am trying so hard to get a gold, what
---
Some but not all of your abilities use weapon damage rather than dps in damage calculation. A weapon with a slow swing time does higher raw damage as compared to a fast weapon with identical dps. In short, a fast weapon will dilute the potency of certain warrior abilities.  You can do a quick Google search for a list of specifically what abilities are affected.
---
Not solo, but duo farming with a pally is pretty good

I hate the wow ui, so I use Elv UI. Other than that I use DBM and Atlas(loot) and some glass specific addons.

---
GROB MOB
---
My search menu broke a couple weeks ago and loads infinitely.
---
They have been dropping a lot it seems. I know of 4 of them on thalnos.
---
Oddly enough in the game I DM, the Paladin is the one who initiates the murder hobo activities of the group.
---
I'll freely admit I was someone who said this before starting classic. I remembered there were tons of things that were problems with Vanilla that they had fixed with QoL in BC and WotLK without really hurting the base community feel and stuff. I had fun in Vanilla, but there were always things that I would look at and think "thank GOD I don't have to deal with that anymore."
---
Now, playing it, I've changed my tune a little. There were definitely things I was nostalgia-goggling over about my time in Vanilla that are still frustrating to deal with, but I've also realized just how much was missing from the current MMO world. Phased servers, cross-server play in the world, group finders that removed the need to interact with the community...while all of them are super convenient, they really killed the feel of an MMO. I still feel like there were some QoL updates in BC and WotLK (specifically meeting stones being able to summon) that were positive changes, but overall I definitely have gotten over my "it's just nostalgia" feel about classic.
---
I made the switch too! I have been horde since Lich King and now I am doing alliance!
---
I just feel as though they may not have been able to come up without a lot of the quest ideas without looking at the world.
---
I was totally expecting a "You have been disconnected" right at the end.
---
Thats the power of the pally *hairflip*
---
Fish in a bucket. Forgot about this.
---
They’ll more than likely add something later on when players complete all Raids/quests etc. the player base will start dying off unless they add more content. A good example would be 2007 Runescape being added and how they continue to adapt to the classic version.
---
Hang in there might be more than one of that guild name, golemagg here lol
---
Sure you can. Shadoweave and warlock quest weapons are a good chunk, plus potentially getting shadow wrath drops yourself, via guildies, or just buying them if they’re not overpriced on the AH.
---
Yeah I've only done SM once for the quest... as Alliance it is one of the hardest places to get to lol.
---
/r/AccidentalRenaissance
---
So you’re saying they flat out lied when they said /who pulls everyone from the server, not just your layer?
---
Maybe D&amp;D is rubbing off on me but what genre has a combat healer that is pure healing? Aside from some modern games like Overwatch I can't think of one. There's also the issue that if there's so much unavoidable damage you're constantly healing there isn't much room for mistakes (like back in the day where boss would do like 3/4 of the tank's health in a swing and you needed a holy pally).
---
I honestly don't mind the change of pace from whack a mole but I really missed hybrid classes. Classic healing is much more about efficiently dealing with damage than quickly topping off healrh bars.
---
Of course, even in retail a good healer (also with a good party) is dpsing (usually with a bland rotation too).
---
Do it, you won't regret it in the slightest
---
I’m skinning as well, are you just vendoring it? I am at the moment, just wanting to know what to do as I get higher. Should I be making light leather with leather scraps before selling it?
---
Now you learnt a valuable lesson : Ask people for advice
---
Perfect, do you have a copy of a 15 year old game and a 15 year old OS?
---
Can't google something you never knew existed.
---
Your persistence is "inspiring"...
---
I agree with you about having the right to use linux and it being far more safe for personal security. But I would say you have no right to play the game and blizzard has no requirement to make the game play smoothly for you either. Imo if you are a gaming linux user and you are not duel booting with windows for many of your games you're doing it wrong.

Yup, thanks for confirming you people are assholes
---
Battle shout generates more threat than demo shout (if number of mobs &gt;7), and doesn’t need to be in range of them. It does have to be in range to buff the group though, and works even better if there are pets in the group receiving it. Sounds silly and backwards, but it works!

No, I'm 45 years old. But when WoD came out I actually took vacation and spent the week at my buddies house. I've known these guys for 20 years. Its not a big issue. I'll just find a guild in the server I'm on and hopefully get to raid with them. That's my goal. I want to raid. I didn't start playing until Wrath.  Want to experience classic raiding

**&lt;ZANCOR&gt;[HORDE][FAIRBANKS-PVP][SEMI-HARDCORE RAIDING][PST]**
---
**We are recruiting for two raid teams, both teams will be raiding at the same time!**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you’ll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We’re about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we’re not improving, then we’re not doing our job.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**

First and foremost ...we’re a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We’re not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren’t for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don’t care if you’re new to classic, as long as you’ve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday(Optional cleanup AKA “The Chungus Raid”) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 3 patch.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don’t need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you’ll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run. Our goal is to get our first raid up by week 3 or 4 of release, we’re not expecting everyone to bend over backwards and get to 60 and get geared up by week 1, but if you want to, you’ll have some buds to play with along the way.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we’ve done this before… Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We will be using EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each week to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
Raiders can bonus EP each week for showing up early, with world buffs, and by contributing raid mats to the guild bank.
---
**What are you looking for?:**
---
**High Priority:**Healers, Melee Dps
---
**Mid Priority:**Tanks, Hunters, Warlocks, Feral Druid DPS/Offtank 
---
**Low Priority:** Mages, Shadow Priest.
---
**Admittance into the guild is a not a guarantee for a raid spot. We are over-recruiting so we can form the most effective raid roster.**
---
*Exceptional players of any class are encouraged to apply regardless of class priority need. Raid spots are not set in stone and can be contested. We are over recruiting so that we are guaranteed a full roster by at least week 3-4 to begin raiding.* 
---
**That sounds great! Where can I sign up?**
---
You can start with telling us a little about yourself [here!](https://forms.gle/cRucWvvKFSCrFDCb9)
---
You can also visit our discord if you have any questions. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/PC9TQv4)
---
Yeah, everyone knows only trade goes on in trade chat.
---
You one of those people who whines about conversation in LFG?
---
If I get a shield at low health, I wait until I get some heals or something dies before I try to remove the shield (which you can do by right clicking the buff as the warrior).  Usually I’ll let the shield sit for a couple seconds and if it’s still there remove it to generate rage. Generally if I’m getting murdered I have enough rage from almost dying to be ok for 3-4 s of shielding in emergencies
---
There are no nerfs coming, just more content. MC is already easier now in classic compared to early vanilla however, due to certain items being buffed and most specs being revamped to be more useful during the original patch cycle of 1.1-1.12, and all of those changes are in classic from the beginning
---
The warrior in our raid got the book, and couldn't trade it.  I think the issue is the master loot filter.  The other person may have had greens on master loot instead of only rares (in our case) or epics (in your case).
---
Blackpill
---
Indeed. Assuming people are in it
---
Just tell a healer to not heal you unless you are lower than 20%, works for me ;)
---
&gt; But as a Lock, I'm Dot, Tab, Dot, Tab
---
Mouseover macros man. Tab targeting is just asking for trouble.
---
Yeah.  SFK is more like 25 max to get XP off all of the trash mobs.  The early part of the dungeon they’re only 18-19.
---
36 is the first real step towards being able to do multiple mobs. Whirlwind takes you from a 0% chance to a 1% chance of taking on 2 mobs.
---
Dont worry, atleast you didnt que deadmines at lvl 17 without spending money on lockpicking
---
You may have left General at some point, then entered a major city. That would probably switch them.
---
You have the full freedom to use your pc how you want it? Just like companies have the full freedom to not support Linux
---
damn i would definitely play that game ;o
---
Weapon procs were actually good back in Vanilla (some of them, anyway).
---
I meant general ^ and because a lot of the time it was a simple question that could’ve been answered in seconds like “where is the weapons trainer or where is this merchant”
---
It's not like I haven't tried it, along with numerous other options. Fact remains; it's not available and there are better options out there.
---
Brutal mogging
---
That would be sick. Especially if they use the unreal engine.
---
Bye Felucina

Well who ever parry wins ;)
---
DI
---
That's how drowning works, but most people can't write about it after.
---
Oh, well that's fine. I honestly don't know why there would be animosity between both groups.. because I'm sure 99% of people here have played retail.
---
I'm saying there is a specific circumstance that causes /who to show your layer which is likely a bug the person making the post was unaware of.
---
From what I remember in open world it worked that way too in Vanilla.
---
If you were attacking a mob and ran off in fear you could finish it, if in the time it took to come back you didn't finish it and came in contact with other mobs it would aggro them onto you.
---
In dungeons it was different, a mob running off into other mobs was instant aggro of those new mobs onto you.
---
I’m not worried about finding someone to play with because as you said there are always alts or new players but if all the alts still have the rush mentality it doesn’t improve my play experience. 
---
You already see it with people only wanting cleave or AOE classes for groups because it’s faster and more efficient. 
---
I still have hope that Classic gameplay with force at least half the people down enough for me to have fun while leveling. It’s done a wonderful job pushing players to group up so far while outside of dungeons.
---
&gt; Arena and BG's are arguably horrible for the "world feel" and open world PvP in WoW. It takes a lot of potential out of the world by sucking players out of the world and rewarding instanced PvP with insane loot rewards while having no counter-balance for open world PvP.
---
Maybe the fact that WoW PvP grew as fast as it did after arena was implemented is proof that most people don't care about world PvP as much as you think my dude. Arena's pretty awesome, it gives an opportunity for skill-based gameplay to actually matter, and offers rewards without being a mindless grind like battlegrounds.
---
&gt;  Also, there are no real incentives to world pvp like there are instanced PvP, and that should change too.
---
PvP doesn't really need that many incentives. There's no honor system right now yet people are out there fighting each other. Most people will never reach a sufficient rank to buy gear during vanilla yet they do battlegrounds. Arena skirmish was a thing. The fun of PvP is what people are after the most, and it turns out that random world PvP isn't the most important thing in that regard.
---
&gt; Not only that, but "competitive" (or e-sport) style PvP eventually hurts the game as well. It forces bad balance changes that eventually make the game shitty for the sake of the e-sport(arena) balance
---
"Bad" balance changes? TBC was almost universally praised for having better balance than vanilla, which had 2 classes that were so much better than the rest and hybrids are mostly worthless. You're extremely biased here.
---
&gt; (Resilience was a big change that was generally bad, among others).
---
lol wut. Resilience was generally very good, going into WSG and getting steamrolled by the tier 3 mage because PvE gear is better in PvP than PvP gear was just bad design.
---
&gt; They could also make awesome world PvP incentives as well, like capturable fortresses on each continent that have NPC/Player controlled defenses(catapults, etc) that when captured, you are able to "sign up" and invest say, 5 gold, and get a gold return based on how long your side defends the base. They tried this with capturable towers in eastern plaguelands but they implemented that half-assed as well.
---
They also tried it with Hellfire Penninsula, Zangarmarsh and Halaa in Nagrand, with fairly decent rewards to start with, and nobody bothered. And with multiple objectives and siege based battlegrounds like Strand of the Ancients, which are among the most commonly blacklisted battlegrounds. Wintergrasp is the only objectives based BG/zone to ever be popular. People really just don't care about objectives that much, they prefer killing each other, which is why they instantly abandon flags in AB etc and why arena was so popular, it took the filler out of PvP while offering a semblance of balance.
---
&gt; Basically, shit's fucked and no one's really talking about it.
---
Shit's not fucked, TBC kept building off the success of vanilla. You have a niche that you like, which is fine, but viewing the entire game through that lens and saying it's fucked as a result is not really all that objective.
---
So, that horn is consumed on use for some reason. If someone manages to tag your kill, you have to wait on someone else to summon it for you. That was a fun 20 minutes.
---
Can't get into an SM run to save my life as a rogue.  All anyone wants is mages.  I don't understand why people want to plow through everything so fast.  What are you actually gonna do when you outlevel almost everything in the game?
---
My first character was a blood elf . At the end of the quest chain in the starter area it asks you to go talk to sylvanas in undercity.
---
Instead of using the teleport orb right behind the quest giver , I walked all the way through the plaguelands . It was painful ;-;
---
Fuck I love classic
---
Yeah bro whatever come at me when you get your carrot on a stick but in the meantime have fun eating my dust.
---
What map addon?
---
As a warrior i can confirm
---
Srsly though! Hell I just dig the wierd items with +fire/healing/shadow bonuses...makes it feel more like D&amp;D, and the miss/resist/parry can be annoying but keeps one on their toes not knowing if that 1 extra mon or 1 last spell will be you loss or victory.
---
The actual class uniqueness, the fun to race for workd chests....like srsly wtf Blizz.
---
Fucking took all the cool immersive stuff out to appease the casual kiddies.
---
my favorite part when i play a mmo is lore but for me the way ff14 does it works way better, and the way i see it is that the linear main story has the role of building the foundation of the world, with a plot that you can easily follow and know that if you read it its important later on(minus the slog that happend at the end of ARR) but during that story you get to see new places and get attached to some character, which in turn makes you want to explore the lands where they live or find more of their story.
---
So far for me it was pretty difficult to follow the story in classic, started out reading all the quests and making a rule to not instal any addons and it was fun for a while but then after a time i realized that it was just slowing my progression and made me walk to the same spots too many times, so i ended up instaling questie and not caring too much what the npc's have to say
---
And its not just in classic that i ended up not caring too much about the story, the same happend with gw2 even doe at the start you have that vision that makes you strive to find out what its all about, but going from place to place i ended up even forgeting about the main plot and just grinding for xp.
---
So yeah, i might be in the minority here but i think having a main story easy to follow help alot in getting invested in the world and wanting to know more about it.
---
ya I can only get off if they love each other
---
What kind of question is this? You get both with one sub, there’s nothing wrong with checking out retail too. You can be on both subs as well, believe it or not.
---
People don’t have to know you play retail to say “go back to retail,” it’s just a stupid ass comment people make when they are being toxic.
---
Trust me there are plenty ways to spend that gold.
---
Smolderweb has an active population both sides last census was 5k horde 3.5k alli during peak hours. The server usually says medium-high
---
Regular /who does. Adding the z-“zonename” does give you a trimmed down list though so it does potentially show just your layer.
---
I almost rage deleted my character last night. Every quest mob in arathi highlands is camped. Level 60 alliance players killing every horde in sight and corpse camping. Dungeon groups falling apart after one bad pull, people only wanting certain group comps. This is not the classic I remember and it's definitely not fun for me.
---
Best of luck to you! Tanking sucks for this reason lol but I still do it, I must hate myself :D It ends with more coordinated groups but you probably won't have those for a while, stay strong!
---
Are you leveling his skills via warlock books or all level 1 skills ?
---
After playing Shaman on Classic, how on earth am I supposed to go back to playing Shaman on retail lmao. That's the biggest kick in the nuts for me, trying to play the classes on retail after playing them on Classic.
---
Because the bosses in SM drop great gear. Especially for melee characters like warriors that are very dependent on it to have a good time. Getting loot is fun. It's also great, stable experience at a stage in game where you begin to have fewer and fewer quests, most of them sprinkled all over the world and in contested zones. While I personally wouldn't run the same dungeon over three times, I can see why some people would choose the non-stop action over the more slower pace of walking, flying, eating/drinking and collecting turtle asses.
---
Deadmines is serious business!
---
Well, I have been thinking about running a Tauren/Troll Warrior... I'll keep you in mind ;)
---
Apparently ve’il was added in 1.11.1, but we are on 1.12, so I guess he should be there. =/
---
I'm trying to get into goos tanking habits early, mark, los pull, generate threat and sunder, shout a lot. But it's rough
---
Thanks man.
---
Yeah, god damn glad I double checked and can learn it in SW. I was about to get in my shoebarus to Darnassus.
---
I had something a bit similar, but ended poorly. I am a undead priest in hillsbrad foothills which is just an utter warzone right now between horde and alliance. I've found a quiet place to kill some mobs and see a dwarf paladin fighting a turtle.
---
Wanting to be friendly, I put shadow word pain on the turtle and start wanding it. Because the turtle was so close to him I can see he initially thought I was attacking as he moved to run away but then once he saw the pain on the turtle he stopped and started killing it again. 
---
In rolls two orcs, who see me presumably wanding the paladin to death as he fights a turtle. 
---
I was not able to stop them in time....sorry little dwarf. I tried.
---
Deep
---
Get this man an int buff hes turning into a low intelligence meatshield
---
He says on a post where the OP posted detailed evidence of this happening.
---
Lmfao
---
Vanilla is also super...well...vanilla. Like the number of spells every class has is so basic. And the PvP isn't nearly as fun as it was around wrath.
---
People forget that WoW hit and sustained its peak numbers (by far) after TBC and started losing people around Cata.
---
Much better explanation and proof than the forum post from 3/4 days ago, thanks for digging into this further and not using a high traffic zone like org :P
---
Because we've had 15 years to study mob AI and play around it
---
How can I do this for my realm?
---
I mean you're asking a Classic subreddit, so basically you're asking in an echo chamber
---
How are you (and others) gathering this data?
---
Judging how half the servers are still full and the other half medium I think not...
---
The PVE world is really not even in Warcraft.  If orcs and humans are not fighting each other, then you have a completely different game than Warcraft.
---
Yes. This is with torment level 3 at level 31.
---
I'm considering rolling a tauren or troll warrior, so I'll keep this realm earmarked for horde methinks
---
Not at my PC but think I use this. 
---
` /equipslot [equiped:Sword] 16 Name of dagger 
---
 /cast Ambush`
---
Then I do the opposite for SS or whatever.  It has worked for changing mh and oh but the slow weapon can’t be labeled as mainhand.
---
Balls made out of arkanit
---
That would look awful with characters clipping through each other, and also will lag and use enormous amounts of VRAM if more than 10 characters (in different gear) present on the screen at the same time
---
Think the spurs add more speed than the carrot too. 3% carrot, 4% spurs, 2% glove enchant. But there seems to be a bit of confusion on the actual numbers in the wowhead comments.
---
Halves, haves, halfs.
---
The amount of things I've seen and said it chat makes me skeptical
---
I love tanking! I like taking care of people, but OOf owie, ouch
---
Do you have points in improved voidwalker?
---
Voidwalker isn't meant to be a full on tank, it's meant to initiate and hold aggro while you DoT and get a few shots off. You will eventually take aggro, but points in improved voidwalker helps.
---
Just a massive tip which you'll find so useful for druid on top of keybinds. 
---
Macros.
---
Seems a daunting task but if you macro all your spells which are out of forms, you'll have such an easier time.
---
Put all these spells on your second action bar above your main ability action bar. All of these spells for me are on my shift key and call contain :-
---
#showtooltip 
---
/Cancel form
---
/Cast
---
This way you can come immediately out of form, cast a heal and get straight back in.
---
As a lvl 31 paladin who’s been healing dungeons I wish more warlocks would life tap to regen mana instead of wanding when I’m sitting at full mana watching the tanks hp bar slowly move. It only takes one holy light to top the lock off at 30%
---
The same mage rolls need on both, lol
---
Thanks for the info, someone also noticed that on my other thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1cs1x/classic\_realm\_statisticswebsite/ezm6s13?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1cs1x/classic_realm_statisticswebsite/ezm6s13?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I'll fix that after work. I think i messed up copy pasting some realm names :D
---
This comment is audible
---
Seems like a lot of people I know are enjoying Final Fantasy, including some that played Vanilla WoW, but it also seems like a distinct experience from what most Classic players wanted.
---
Settle down. You were the one accusing me of spreading lies when I’m saying I’ve tried myself and it doesn’t work, the maker of the addon says it doesn’t work and multiple people responding on curseforge say it doesn’t work. I’m sure we are all lying?
---
All you had to say was you got it to work instead of accusing me me of lying.
---
no one is raiding right now. Hold your stacks until people need to purchase consumables. people are too interested in grinding and saving there money for mounts right now.
---
I will admit I only started playing this week, so I am probably behind the curve on the largest grouping of players. But FYI...
---
I was 24 horde on Stalagg fighting in Arathi. I can see how zones like Stv are probably a mess right now.
---
Honestly
---
I'm a mage bro, I'll just nova then block so they all attack you at once. The rest is up to you.
---
How different itemization will give your paladins ability to tank. I mean if you put mp5 on their gear so they dont go oom, they will have less stamina etc than warrior ie. being worse. 
---
I mean it was already like that in way in tbc, but at least paladin exceled at aoe tanking
---
So many Taurens when somehow my realm is like 65% Undead
---
This was still viable in TBC, I made my epic flying money from it with plenty left offer to buy the deeds to the Thandol Span!
---
Yeah I know what I got myself into, I was mainly referring to stance requirements.  EG I couldn't even Charge to engage as a tank until level 20+ when I got Tactical Mastery
---
Just wait for Un'Gorro.... I hope you dont have a dinosaur phobia...
---
I’m on Earthfury as well. We have a guild that we are recruiting for and though it is quiet, there’s been plenty of ganking and new players popping up. I think it’s very instinctive to jump off Herod, and then in less than a week call it quits. I can’t speak for you, but we play for the long game, the population has increased, and if it doesn’t get to a certain threshold on its own they will merge it. No worries here, we found our home.
---
If thou rolls a nelf, thou shall take The Pilgrimage and show it all respect. Thou who cheats The Piligrimmage shall be exiled from darnassian society and might as well become a foul highelf

On the contrary, they wanna kill you as much as possible so you have to spend money for them to repair your gear!
---
How do I get to SFK as alliance at that lvl?
---
Right-Click Report works great on them.  Cleans up my chat window too.

Yes, it's wasting people's time. If the AH had a function to sort by buyout without downloading an add-on than maybe I would consider your immense intellectual prowess regarding the debate, but alas, there isn't. You are using a lack of UI functionality to get your listings to sort to the top for the purpose of getting people to just buy your items rather than sorting through the rest. 
---
Being able to spam all of your mats at the top of the page without being able to sort them out is bad enough. Being able to rip down your auctions knowing you're going to from the get go unless they get bought out is worse, and it's abuse of the AH functionality imo.
---
Is this a new copy pasta?
---
Is that the warrior wanting to DPS or the group wanting him to be prot?
---
Can't really level as prot.
---
Its been a real pleasure.
---
RIP Uncle Phil
---
If the population holds (unlikely, I know), I would love to see them instead branch off into an alternate timeline with it's own expansions. With how they've handled the lore in the retail expansions I'm sure many people would be welcoming of a do-over.
---
&gt;The number of spells every class has is so basic.
---
All of my characters so far have more abilities than their retail counterparts, I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Talents and abilities were pruned to nothingness in retail.
---
Nice pally sword!
---
Here's the thing with warlocks and it's something that really annoys me.
---
Have a set of int gear in your bags for dungeons. If you're life tapping so much in a dungeon that your life is constantly at 5 hp, I'm not prioritizing healing you over the tank, it's just not happening. And when you life tap you contribute zero damage to the dungeon during those GCDs. 
---
So do everyone a favour and have a set of int gear so you will have a big dick mana bar that will require you to life tap less.
---
Just because you are a DPS class doesn't mean you only need one set of gear.
---
No, it needs to be a repost of a repost of a repost with watermarks from 3 different sites and pixeleated so god damn much you can barely read it.
---
IDKFA
---
You should be able to heal without issues, and as other said, you can put sole intel or spirit pieces. But also please buy water because since you are in wrong spec, you will need to regen a lot
---
Yeah thats only reason i like classic. When layering bless you you can meet same people which is good. Outside of that its bring rabbit ears x 10000. No way im doing this again. Maybe after bgs will be a thing.
---
This has happened -- and will continue to happen -- with any popular game that will ever exist.
---
Try saying something like "Overwatch is a fun game" on any popular forum.  You'll be bombarded with people calling it trash garbage and rating it 0/10 etc etc.  People have been saying "game is dying" for over 2 years now.  One of these days, Overwatch will die.  As will Classic WoW.  It's inevitable.  And when that happens, whether it's 1 year from now, or 5, or 30, those people will get all smug, saying they "called it."
---
Basically, you just ignore those people.  They'll never shut up.  But I believe it was the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, in one of his private messages to his contemporary Catilius Severus, who mused:
---
&gt; The haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate  
---
&gt; I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake shake  
---
&gt; Shake it off.  
---
&gt; I shake it off.
---
Thanks for introducing me to the Auctionator/Auctioneer apps with this post! Can't wait to go home and add it!
---
We haven’t even brought up the pvp aspect of the game at all yet either hahaha
---
[Welcome to the loop](https://i.redd.it/4i8d7djfsel31.jpg)
---
You can say it's different ways of playing, but i think it's more of a good vs bad situation. 
---
The healer can stand there afk and only cast healing spells, and you'll complete the dungeon.
---
The healer can do dps while still keeping everyone alive, and you'll complete the dungeon faster.
---
Play however you want, but one of those players is worse than the other one.
---
I wish the mages I play with had that mentality
---
That you would have to compare with somebody else that play on the same server, have the same ISP and lives in your general area. I mean you can power cycle pc, modem, router and your fuse box all day, but you will still be routed the same way because once signal passes your demarc, it is out of your hands.
---
Because the "Classic" community isn't as good as they pretend to be, or try to make themselves out to be.  They're honestly worse than the retail community at this point.
---
I'm enjoying Classic for the game, but the community is as terrible as I remember it being.
---
Pfft, I'm level 15 and I absolutely dominate multiple mobs... 3-4 levels lower than me.
---
I'll try that later.  I was using a /script to swap 16 and 17 but it would get stuck periodically and I couldn't apply poisons one one slot until I relogged.
---
Oh I take penis.
---
^^^wait.
---
You're right, and it does make it difficult.
---
I knew this would happen. There isn't a single secret farming spot or method that hasn't found it's way into a guide.
---
Pirates in STV are a good choice. Good green drops, and cloth to sell / craft and sell etc.
---
You commented on his post! Hahaha
---
He was minding his business making a comment and you initiated the conversation between the two of you. What’s the point of commenting if you’re gonna cry when someone says something back?
---
Thank you so much, I was just looking for some good priest add-ons.
---
S T O N K S
---
Noice!
---
Why are you in duskwood at lvl 4?
---
I thought DM was locked until a later phase? Is there a wing open already?
---
When I leveled a lock in the past I just used the vw to bring me more victims to dot
---
Or the community can come together and solve the problem, like we did. All while not being spied on by MS.
---
He was trying to let the mob get the killing blow so you would lose durability.
---
Heya, sorry it took a while to respond to you. It looks like you have a store now - are you planning to add prints for purchase? I'm not sure how I could purchase the Sarkoth print otherwise :/
---
The majority of healers do this now.
---
I've gone full tank spec on my druid just for dungeons. Whilst it's incredible boring, if you want to hit 60 in as little time as possible then dungeon grinding seems to be the way forward.
---
At the moment I'm 49. 2-3 hours of dungeon grinding will give me a level. Going back to questing solo I'm looking at 4-5 hours .

WoW Classic is challenging and requires research to be good at. Look up the information yourself if thats the issue. Asking the same questions over and over isnt going to spell out well. Millenials are the primary people playing this game as we grew up with it. We dont have much time for BS. Going into dungeons or PvP scenarios and having completely incompetent people is frustrating. Nobody has time to babysit. Git gud
---
Play what you want, how you want, this game isn't going anywhere. I have a 30 lock, 25 warrior, and 22 druid
---
But... my paladin only heals in pvp :)
---
Why would you play every single class? There wont be alot of people who would want to create 9 classes and raid with all of them
---
*Read*
---
I don't think the hybrid tax was ever in effect in WoW.  It's more classic being classic effectively - druid doesn't have a normal Rez that's the only reason they aren't wanted as much.
---
You need a DPS with a Rez if you bring a druid.
---
That and on raids druids hots don't stack in classic...
---
From a healing perspective they are fine.  I think they have the only insta heal and best emergency group heal.
---
There's a bunch of other things too like innervate which are important.
---
This is the right answer.  I loved Wrath but it was where many features were introduced that people claim killed WoW.

Dropped on the 2nd kill for me on two different toons lol
---
Apologies, I misread your comment and didn't realize you were comparing it to Wrath. That's very true.
---
I was (wrongfully) comparing to retail in mine.
---
Sap enemies as they are going for herb nodes. Loot the node and run away. Even though I could more than likely send them to the nearest graveyard, its just so much fun to do this to the same player over and over again : ).
---
This was at 60 on Northdale, RIP Noobslayer!
---
Ya I know the attacks hurt this weekend. but last night on a Sunday at 8:50 cst on est server there was a 67min que. I got in right the 50min mark.
---
Maxing water gives my computer heart palpitations.
---
I’m more worried about the fully grown adults that act like this..
---
Had a 20+ year old dude shouting homophobic remarks at my 12yo brother over a game the other day.. they were definitely middle-schoolers (about 15 years ago though)
---
I think you did a pretty good job actually.
---
Did they post on this? Any idea how long?
---
Agreed. Classic is everything I’ve waited for. Glad it’s back and it’s real.
---
Read = Dead
---
I don't know wtf the rest of you are talking about.
---
Thanks, and you had Instant Replay running in the background no? Trying to figure out how this stuff works hehe
---
oh god 🤕
---
this definitely happened in vanilla too, so.... ????
---
jeez how are people at end game already? I'm struggling to hit 20 over here lol (i just started this weekend)
---
I'm all for cheap AH stuff, but at least post it for enough that you don't lose money on the AH cut
---
Snipping Tool is 100% better and more user friendly than PrintScreen.  Fight Me.
---
Warriors are the *only* viable raid tanks in Vanilla.
---
Fury is also very good DPS.
---
Arms can crush in PvP.
---
They scale exceptionally well with gear -- they're a slog to level and start gearing up, but as the gear gets better, they just hit harder and harder.
---
They can use both Sulfuras and Thunderfury.
---
There's also something of a 'mentality' about Warriors. The big beefy motherfucker rocking the heavy plate and the biggest, baddest weapon. The crushing melee fighter taking names on the ground. It appeals to a lot of people.
---
Can't say I've had any issues with it so far. Using it came about out of necessity after the KOS Word document I was using started getting a bit too long. Can you confirm you're using the Classic version?
---
Cheers! I'll look at the tree and figure out these abbreviations now haha
---
You just keep tanking that ore, like a boss!  Who else is going to save us from the rampaging iron?
---
Sure, I can agree with that stance on it.
---
Already got my mount hehe
---
AH SHIT here we go again
---
No problem always happy to help! Just don’t feel too restricted play it the way you enjoy and pick the spec that looks the most fun to you. Ultimately classic gives you the freedom to do that and still participate in dungeons, join raids, etc. if you enjoy the spec you play it’ll make the leveling experience that much less grindy and more fun, which personally is where a lot of my enjoyment with classic comes from.
---
&gt; But it was a cool story so it gained traction and sparked conversation.
---
Thank you for explaining why a shitty picture wasn't downloaded. Hint: it had nothing to do with the picture!
---
&gt; There wouldn’t be a need for posts like this calling people out of every phone pic was downvoted to hell and only seen by sorting New
---
We get it, you don't sort by new.
---
Seems you should get it in the mail.
---
Even better--the shortcut in MC. It's a hunter rite of passage.
---
On paper the class is pretty easy, but there's a lot of stupid little things to be mindful of that can wreak havoc if you fuck up once.
---
This is just simply amazing.
---
Have you been banned yet? Or do you think you will in the future?
---
Yup, it does make a huge difference when you know what the gear looks like and then see that warrior wearing Shmourne etc. I mean thats what you are grinding for
---
if I had to pick one thing, from BC onwards, that ruined the game, it was flying mounts.  It trivialized the world, made you not have to travel through it, just over it.  On PVP servers, it completely removed the danger from the world.
---
The other thing was when they removed world pvp and pvp servers and went with this bullshit they have now.
---
Alt whore here
---
Don't worry about it
---
The game has been out for like 2 weeks not even, phase 2 won't be out for months, if anything start banging out Alts now, because come Honor system introduction in Phase 2 leveling will see a spike in WPvP (assuming you're playing on a PvP server like it's meant to be ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Why say few word when 😂 do trick?
---
cringe comment.
---
I think some servers had issues yesterday too which is why I rounded to 2
---
Friendship with the enemy is not to be encouraged.
---
Blizzard messed up in the way they did this. It was like a used car sales tactic - it’s free and you gotta do it now or the deal won’t be as good. Those were big warning signs.  The adult way to do it would have been to: 
---
- announce free transfers would be happening starting at a specific date at least one week I advance and lasting for  a month 
---
- Allow you to transfer back after a period of two weeks of a waiting period if you transferred a character that was over level 20 originally and regretted it
---
-  during the lead up to the transfer time, allow any player from Skeram or Herod to hold their current name Earthfury for 1g per character for the first week of transfer. Before the lead up, the other player on Herod/Skeram with the same name could outbid you. This way, when you transfer, you know you have that characters name, even if you do it a week after the transfers start
---
- same as above, but hold the guild name
---
These three things would have alleviated the following concerns:
---
- how do keep my name with certainty, even if I transfer a week from now
---
- what if I don’t like the new server
---
- let me plan for this and not pop it on me at 4 pm on a Tuesday 
---
- let know know I don’t have to transfer right away but have a week to think about it
---
Yeah I did ok on the bears but I must have killed at least 30 spiders for that one item.
---
Im torn between my 39 mage, AoE grinder and my 21 Paladin, jack of all trades.
---
Perfect size to fit all the roids in....
---
I never touched BfA, just always heard how bad it was but never really paid attention to what was going on. Why is BfA so unfun? I heard 8.2 was supposed to make it better.
---
Something to aspire to right there.
---
I've recently moved into Ashenvale with my WL, and sure am enjoying picking people off - majority of them being Nelf's makes it somewhat more satisfying.

---
Which is a shame and as someone who grew up to resent getting the shit slapped/ass whoopins I received as a kid I'm glad you're sticking to your guns OP.
---
Even if there's a chance you may be a dirty Horde player.
---
Yeah, I have been invited into a lot of groups when I put a LFG for DPS RFC / WC and when I join there is no other tanks. That's really the only problem I have had so far but I feel once I get to level 40ish and I can cleave everything down in dungeons, it might be better for me to just DPS. Tanking just doesn't interest me unless I am off tanking a mob or two in a dungeon when we pull a big group.
---
We can only hope haha!
---
PvP for life &lt;3
---
Pretty dope!
---
If you've been active on private servers at all, you would see that TBC has historically been the least successful. Granted the core code is harder to replicate and results in buggier servers than vanilla or wotlk, but take that for what you will.
---
Git gut ;)
---
More like
---
Tbc&gt;vanilla&gt;wotlk&gt;hello kitty&gt;other stuff
---
I chose a hunter for Classic since I knew leveling is easy and in like ranged dps. I had a hunter and a priest when I played before. I want to have both dps hunter and discipline priest, eventually I'll have both at end game. :)
---
They only way you can get better at the harder dungeons and raids in retail is by experiencing them (and gearing obviously). Don’t worry about a bunch of spazes nobody’s first run of a instance is gonna be perfect just do your best.
---
Yeah I forgot just how many of the small stuff wasn't in vanilla like your targeted NPC showing up in the mini map or the flight master showing up explored areas of the world map.
---
Psychic scream and that shaman will be dead before he can touch you again.
---
I'm with you. I don't think many of them have played. I did see someone Saturday looking for a LBRS run "58+ only, anything less will be ignored" Dude was level 57 himself.  The retail mindset will stick through and these players will cap dungeons. Soon it will be must have full epics, or BIS.
---
Maybe as a DPS. As a tank or a healer, dungeons in Classic are far more difficult than normal dungeons on retail.
---
I'm on fairbanks, was in duskwood, darkshire last night.
---
group of horde south of darkshire, in view, just ganking people. I'm too low level, I decide i can fly to SW, and get some people in on the action. 
---
get to SW and i out something like
---
"group of horde in the 30s, on ?? ganking people just south of darkshire if anyone wants in"
---
i get a reply
---
"@wrenagade why don't you just switch servers?"
---
uhh.. what? I wasn't even complaining, just calling out where horde was lol
---
alliance is way more toxic than horde imo, but i still enjoy alliance more, they are just dicks
---
I don't think it's wrong at all. If you want to raid or properly PvP it's better to have an active guild / large guild with a good leader.
---
You'll be surprised how insanely difficult it is to get 40 attuned people into molten core
---
Yeah, afaik there isnt a great spirit mace drop until lvl 40 Sm Cath
---
If buddy takes the AH game *that* seriously, I'd hold their niche of the AH hostage for a couple G.  Gimme 2g or I'll be undercutting you every day at vendor cost.  Screw the deposit, I'll eat the loss. Hell I'll load a lvl 1 alt up with funds just to buy the book and mail it.  Shit I'll give it away for free.
---
Should've taken the 1 sale loss and not bitched about it; now it cost you more.
---
Would you settle for a screenshot on my phone of the picture taken on a phone instructing how to take a screenshot without a phone?

---
Traitor
---
your loss, you will have plenty of time to stumble around
---
Yeah one honor hits large scale world PvP will be happening all over the shop. I prefer PvE but it's optional and with the time I have to play, I'm not interested in being ganked (even once) and interrupting my flow.
---
Also as a warlock with life tap, I can't imagine the pain of life tapping and being ambushed by a rogue!
---
This is just the mentality of retail in a nut shell. Everything is about the player and not the group. 
---
These people won’t last long.
---
I played over 24 hours Friday/Saturday/Sunday. I was hearing WoW while I was going to sleep last night. Thunder claps, crits.
---
Ooh i’m Oceanic aswell. Us Aussies tend to be quite heavy on the off-handed insults and comments but I haven’t found more then a few malicious dickheads out of the dozens of wonderful people in this game.
---
Dude tell me about it.
---
I tank so many dungeons where the DPS just go balls in as soon as I pull, all target different mobs, and it's just a mess. Everyone is taking some sort of damage because of it. So the healer has to heal everyone and top them off. I tell the DPS to cool it for a few seconds when I pull and they tell me to just hurry up and pull, it'll be faster if they just go all in.
---
Thing is, after every pull our poor Healer has to drink since the DPS took so much damage. Thus making the run much longer than it needs to be. All they need to do is give me literally 3 seconds, and target skull...
---
Let them die, that's how they learn.
---
* Your BFF, a healer.
---
&gt;hey on Miks scrolling battle text are you able to remove the targets name and see only the healing?
---
What is the aggro radius of pets? It seems to be far less than a regular player's radius, but I can't find anything online that says exactly how many yards it is.

I used to talk about bringing classic wow back in MoP days. All the time. My friends would always say I was full of shit but here we are. I have no doubt something like this is going to come to fruition. Blizzard most certainly has the money to make it a reality. And they have a massive customer base who would buy it.
---
This is the right way to do it; murder them as soon as you've finished while hopefully leaving their quest unfinished.
---
Yes the people are big problem but what can you expect?
---
Better community, well until we lose the people on the hype train. Cant wait for them to get bored and go back to playing league.

Enjoy your prison time!

Wow was released half of my lifetime ago..this comment really makes it sink in for me.
---
Nice idea. But my wife hates video games. We all like different stuff and that’s ok. She travels sometimes for work, and that’s when I play.
---
Not to mention if Blizzard lowered the pop cap back to launch levels Herod would be back to 10k queues, and the queues will go up unless blizzard abandons layering all together.

But at closer inspection it seems that the "old" will be the one released in phase 2 and the new one not until phase 6. :(

I ended up getting GM sword when they made that a point grind instead of a rank.  I believe that was part of the BC pre-patch.

Groups are not falling apart after one bad pull.  People are taking nearly any group comp (did an SM Lib run with 2 mages, 2 priests, and a warr last night).
---
Nobody is camping/griefing but there is lots of WPVP happening in Arathi, Hillsbrad, and other places...  
---
Maybe try a different server?
---
I mean, sure I can wand if you want, but when you're on half health and I don't notice or miss you because I wasn't precasting, it's on you.
---
Eh, that would just slow things down more. I'm like 5th on the threat meter at that point...might not even be ahead of the healer.
---
I started playing WoW during TBC back in 2007. I played steady through to around when Icecrown Citadel was released in late 2009 / early 2010. I tried to come back during MoP but I grew bored of the game and felt that I couldn't keep up with all of the changes to the game, so I didn't enjoy it as much and stopped playing again.
---
I grabbed WoW classic last weekend after watching streamers play, and I feel like I'm back in 2007 and just discovering the game again. I can't wait to get home and play more.
---
I mean, no.
---
All that casual trash was added after TBC and even so, addons have existed always for WoW. That's how you get those features.
---
kind of my point lol, its always been 16 and you can't change it.  I would like it to be something I can change
---
I didn't do much config with Luna and the party/raid frames light up when there's a debuff that I can dispel
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
&gt;Is this what the Horde stands for? Murdering pilgrims in foreign lands seeking to develop their creative abilities?
---
Alliance pilgrims are fine.  Gnomes can fuck the fuck off.
---
Having someone targeted isn't usually a sign of aggression on its own. It's more about keeping an eye on that player so you can see what they're doing.
---
Owls, vultures and bats for me. With screech my pet can keep aggro on 2 or 3 mobs with ease while I multi shot them down
---
Hey, I'm so sorry. My cousins (well, my cousin and his wife) got me into WoW in 2007 and his wife passed unexpectedly right after the Classic announcement was made. We were all so excited to play together again, but my cousin can't really bring himself to try now that she's gone. 
---
I feel you. It sucks. :(
---
Just makes me want layering removed already.
---
Well actually everyone then can get upgrades since they can buy other boes.
---
I have to recommend Benediction - WPVP is super active, we're right at that sweet spot where we always have a ton of people on, but not at queue level.
---
as a healer, lifetapping warlocks are the worst. your mana is not more valuable than my mana; sustain your own hp.
---
Wow. I’ve been trimming my other monitor out with pain for literally years. I feel like a dumbass
---
Named kaz modan and have Horde flair but talk about killing Horde.
---
Also, come at me you little bitch. Hunters are food for me @46.

Wolves are great, definitely not one of the "bad" pet types that people will lament.

I've been trying to decide between and wolf and a boar myself.

Fuck the meta, I love the class fantasy of being a Priestess of Elune.
---
Really fun little video and you got to the point. I love the lack of a 5 minute intro.
---
Yep, last night the global chat on horde side was actually buzzing. It’s kind of iffy for groups above SM right now, but the amount of RFC and WC groups forming speaks well of the longer term.
---
not initially, once it was clear i wasnt getting any help, i nova'd and tried to run, still doesnt change the fact i helped him when the mobs we're tagged to me, maybe im just too nice, im the sort of person that nova's/cone of cold's people pulls as im walking by just to be helpful
---
Issue is no one has gold to buy that stuff right now. Along with the fact that half the population has the same idea. Best way to make gold right now is to buy the insanely cheap mats from the AH and get profession skills up
---
IIRC it's unreadable to the opposite faction
---
Then you were gods amongst men. Doing the heroics in quest blues and normal blues required CC
---
Classic is pretty faceroll as far as PvE goes my man. You could always weave melee attacks in between shots by running in and out of range to keep yourself entertained.
---
Are you on a PvP server? Because in PvP, Hunters have one of the highest skill ceilings.
---
where I live I can only get pizza pizza so its normally just pep and cheese
---
Lol you’re really arguing if the person actually enjoys it or not? Maybe you don’t understand but that doesn’t equate to “can’t be true because I don’t agree!” Yes, people like actually walking around because everything isn’t so simple and immediate. Makes everything feel more earned through your actions by the time you do get your mount.
---
It should really be listed as 4 instances.
---
GY, Lib, Arm, and Cath.
---
Kek. Tinfoil much.
---
Thanks a lot! I was afraid the experience would be reduced for no doing enough damage!
---
7. No life
---
I would love to have you in my group. Unfortunately I’ve had so many negative experiences with rogue players already I really hesitate anytime a rogue whispers me to join.
---
Thank you, actually didn't know how to as only one screen :P
---
Cloth. Farm all of the cloth. There are people in each city that take donations and the gives out rep.
---
Healers and the pve encounters in xiv were literally made with healer dps considered and added in. Healers in classic aren't. They aren't going to waste a large portion of mana to do an insignificant amount of damage. They auto or wand and that's it. You just have to get used to there being downtime.
---
There's a way up the mountain from there?
---
&gt;Thanks a lot! I was afraid the experience would be reduced for no doing enough damage!
---
&gt; But in the top left of the image (Which is NSFW) is a massive pair of balls 
---
Ha ha ha ha! Fuck me, I laughed at that, wow.
---
I believe that you enjoying it and i love servers being a thing again. Im just wondering how people can be amazed that they have to run till lvl 40.
---
I never said that i want ONLY wotlk.
---
It doesss. Even when you get shadow form that helps. Issue I have is hunters if I can't get in there dead zone I just die.
---
I don’t think he’s a troll
---
Sometimes only 2 pieces lol
---
This is ruining my *immersion*.
---
For shits and giggles, let's do the full math on lost game time alone, shall we? (Because I'm bored.)
---
Each instance has a 20k capacity before it's locked, currently, right? (I'm not finding hard numbers off-hand, but that's the number I've heard, and I recall seeing them increase it in response to 10k+ deep queues. If you have hard numbers, I would be happy to adjust my calculation.)
---
From what I've seen, there seems to be more or less a bell curve of low-&gt;medium-&gt;high-&gt;full-&gt;locked, with medium to medium-high (ie - borderline, with a few dozen people tipping it one way or the other) being at the peak.
---
There is, at this point, [73 total realms](https://www.pcgamer.com/wow-classic-servers/) according to PC gamer. For easy math's sake, let's say there are 80. That article is a week old, after all.
---
So, we have 5 levels of capacity, and we can assume that locked == 20k people, giving us 4 ranges. Assuming the ranges are distributed evenly, it means:
---
- Low == 0-4,999
---
- Medium == 5k-9,999
---
- High == 10k-14,999
---
- Full == 15k-19,999
---
Let's assume 80% are in the high-medium to medium-high position (so around 7,500 to 12,500), and again for math, let's say it averages to 10k.
---
80% of 80 = 64 servers with 10k people, or 64k total people
---
That leaves 20% (16 servers) in the other positions. 
---
Now, I think it's safe to assume there aren't 0 players on any low-pop servers, and odds are good that no server sits in low-pop for very long. I know I've seen days where there are no low-pop servers at all. So let's assume 4,000 as the floor. This is probably also a small number of servers at this level, and I suspect they don't stay that low, so let's rope them into the low-medium group and use 5k even for them. At 5% of the servers, or 4 servers, that's 5k times 4 or 20k people.
---
There are some servers that are known to lock, right? I think Herod is one of them, not? I've also seen one or two others lock (Windseeker, I think). They're extreme outliers, so...what? 3, maybe 5 total at any given time during peak? I don't have much of any insight into the European region and I admittedly don't look at Oceanic, though I doubt people wouldn't filter to lower-pop servers at least some of the time, reducing the total number of locked servers. That said, 5% of servers would be 4 servers, which seems reasonable - 1 for Europe, 1 for Oceanic, and 2 for Americas (on average). 4 servers at 20k people, or 80k people.
---
That gives us the final 10% somewhere in the full range. 8 servers, averaging to 17,500 people each. Since there are more people than anticipated, let's assume 18,000 each. 18k times 8 is 144k people.
---
So our final numbers are:
---
64k + 20k + 80k + 144k = 308k
---
The downtime went on for roughly two days so far, correct? At $0.50 per sub, per day, the translation is easy - $308k just in the lost game time for a 2-day outage.
---
Is there something above grand larceny? I feel like there should be.
---
This is exactly right. Shamans and mages were recruited heavily during that first patch.
---
He is my twink, yeah. Created back in vanilla spend countless hours fishing and farming the arena grand masters. Then they added heirlooms which unfortunately ruined twinks.
---
THey still had class identity in tbc though. They still didnt do as much dps as pure dps, still offered alot of utility. They gained really cool buffs which were spec only buffs which helped the party alot. That and the fact that you had smaller raids made them more wanted and the disparity between hybrids and pure dps classes was much smaller. You still required ele sham, bala druid, etc etc. So over all hybrids made like a third of your dpsers in a raid which was pretty good i think.
---
I was there for Chestnutz 2019..., you all don't even know!

What would you call difficulty?

Is there a wow classic compatible version of auctioneer?

I am glad the weekend is over so I can get back to work and neglecting those people.

I know, right? It actually feels like an MMO again rather than a set of isolated instances.

And it won't ever happen in 5 mans. You need to get in and get a revenge up as fast as possible and even then a lot of dps decide to start attacking before you even get a chance to hit the mob. As if your simple presence is enough to generate threat.
---
‘It’s going to be worth it’
---
Whispered the wand.
---
 You literally can't switch off PVP in game. You'd have to change to a completely different server. If you're in a contested zone, you're fair game.
---
exactly what i thought of lmao faker v ryu
---
Honor system p2, select bgs p3.
---
even though it costs 2s I rebirth every friendly corpse I come across
---
&gt;Simply run and stand on top of the tank until they taunt it off you.
---
I run to the tank, make sure the mob isn't sitting on anything, and jump in place until they taunt it off. Ease of targeting and noticeable actions makes it easier for them.
---
Figured! Now worries.
---
I remember the first time I lost a level because I died shortly after a ding. Terrible feeling lol
---
No addons
---
Bartender and zperl have been my addons since I can remember.  I started using Vuhdo for healing a year ago too.  Used to use healbot, but that died.
---
I tried to tank RFK as a 27 warrior and they kicked me from the group because I couldn't hold aggro from the lvl 33 shaman casting earth shock every time the CD was over.  Shams, you cause a lot of aggro plus dps is allowed to take damage... just an fyi
---
What's the logic here? Only rogues can open it so only they get the loot? How do they get to the chest in the first place?
---
My phone doesn't have those buttons.
---
I'm alliance there and a mid 40s warrior. I'm hetting ganked constantly and it is obviously a horde server.
---
I look at the numbers and im like... wow maybe its because warriors are targets and im only thinking about the times i was overrun...
---
Then i look at the pop data for that level range - oooh yeah im right. 
---
Also, all the fast levelers are mostly mages and hunters - warrior life is rough right now in open world.
---
Which is the addon to see what the other guy is casting?
---
Someone you boink on the reg
---
What is the Duke of Lumbridge doing in WoW?
---
ugh flying mounts, those are in retail
---
Macro shield swap on casters, use it on bosses that will crush you.
---
The longer a mob lives, the less damage it does. If it dies 20% faster, you've taken 20% less damage this fight, more than your 10-15% shield mitigation. I'd rather heal a mail/plate warrior with a 2h in def stance than a rogue/mage/etc that took aggro because warrior was taking poo for dmg or doing poo for dmg to hold aggro.
---
Obviously don't take this to the extreme and watch healer mana. If your priest is wanding and you're sitting above 90%....2h would've prob been better for the fight.
---
I got a quest in Desolace yesterday to kill centaurs and collect their pendants. I went back to read the quest description and the dude just wanted me to kill the centaurs, but while I’m at it grab their pendants so he could “throw them in the fire and laugh.”
---
The undead creeper?
---
I use 1-5 hotkeys standard for my most used abilities. In the interface you can enable more hotkey bars, enable them. I have one of those bars configured to my mouse side keys. I use keys 1-9 on my mouse a secondary hotbar for less commonly, but still fight critical items. This enables me to have instant access to 14 keys without moving my hand off wasd and my mouse. Takes time getting used to it and at the begining you wont need all of them. As u level just keep adding the most commonly used ones to where they feel comfortable for you.
---
No matter how well you layout keys and macros it's going to feel awkward. Setup and play with it for a while until you begin to learn the muscle memory and it will become very intuitive very quickly
---
Honestly I'm doing pretty good just hoarding grays and selling everything. Everything.
---
That’s not a thing
---
I always throw a renew on the lock when their mana is low so they can keep up the deeps.
---
If you are soloing... ideally targeting NPC's 1 to 2 levels below you are going to be your best bet for grinding as a warrior.  Make sure you always have the best food you can get to reduce downtime.
---
I am currently a 31 warrior, but my wife is playing holy priest, so we blast thru everything.  If you don't have access to a pocket healer, If I was you, I'd grind to \~level 30, get into SM and do dungeons to 60.  The dungeons starting at SM kind of roll into one another level wise (SM GY-Cath, RFD, Mauradon, ZF, BRD, etc...) and you'll be better geared in the short term when you have to venture out for the occasional quest.
---
Now if only I could get my Netherwing Dragonling pet from TBC collectors edition I bought way back when lol
---
I just leave when I'm not looking for a group.
---
no you can do it, it's just shitty. you need to be standing completely still and spamming a fd/trap macro for like 1-2 seconds before it works.
---
Because I could pick up Expert Fishing in Booty Bay too.
---
19, currently lvl 31 trying to farm mats for WW quest.

&lt;Lost Crusaders of Salt&gt; | PvE Horde | Pagle Server | Semi-Hardcore Raiding
---
&lt;Lost Crusaders of Salt&gt; is aiming to be a fun-loving, dedicated Semi-Hardcore guild that is focused on good, steady progression through end game content. We are more concerned with people's numbers than hardcore min/maxing: if you can take some crazy one-off build and make it look good, we don't care. Numbers &gt; Spec.
---
We are currently accepting all levels and classes at the moment, and both Vanilla Veterans and Newbies are welcome.
---
We're not expecting people to sign up for every single raid night. Real life is a thing, and it needs to be addressed. As is burnout. We respect and understand if you need a night off just to recover. That being said, we ARE expecting you to show up to every single raid night you sign up as available for. While we understand real life can happen, and missing a raid is not the end of the world, it will be an issue if it happens too many times.
---
We are planning to raid on the following days and times (All times Eastern):
---
Fridays: 9:30 PM-1:00 AM with 12:00-1:00 as Overtime
---
Saturdays: 8:00 PM-1:00 AM with 12:00-1:00 as Overtime
---
Sundays: 8:00 PM-11:30 PM
---
If you're interested in joining or have questions, please join our discord, seek out Muhkow on the Pagle server or reach out to me through Reddit here!
---
I don't think a rogue is a fair comparison on a classes ability to drop agro...
---
That was just one example of a popular, high demand enchant. I’m not sure about tailoring patterns, nor where all the high demand owns for each profession specifically drop.
---
100% kinda like a battleground but 5 vs 5 and the classic 3 lane minion wave tower stuff. I think it can definitely be cool to see how that would fly jnvanilla. Easier to balance too!
---
But then since no 2 situations are ever the same then all equivalencies are false. Hence, your argument is false.
---
Jesus, for 100g I'd fuck off to wherever you like.
---
Ah yes, someone is an asshole for telling someone that's being an asshole to get fucked. I see now how you logiced yourself into the position you have. Big brain.
---
I support any story that ends with Horde killing Alliance. 
---
You are a beautiful traitor.
---
I remember raiding stormwind back in the day and then attempting to raid the true alliance capital, stacking hundred strong in the tram.
---
Good old days.
---
lol you followed me? Can't get enough huh?
---
Same reason you set up a trust to collect your lotto winnings. Just keeping that privacy and silence is nice.
---
Sometimes when I’m in Shadowform and press the spell to go out of Shadowform it won’t work unless I actually right click the icon in the upper right corner, other times pressing the spell button again works with no problems. Anyone know what may be causing this or a solution?
---
I dont think anyone really expected that, it was usually said about 2 months in the population will dip.
---
Just enjoy the game mate, no point in trying to attack Classic haters
---
The for tend to stand quite a distance behind the tank. If you maybe had a Bow? You could pull from farther away? Gives them less chance to pull extra.
---
T1 was terrible for a mage. A set of random pieces was better. Which made me sad because 8/8 wasn't as hard to get. Now t2 was awesome.
---
Why would that make it impossible?
---
Dodging other premades and steamrolling randoms isn't exactly engaging content either.
---
Is that before or after you sacc'd him to save your own ass? We all know what goes down with voidwalkers....
---
this is a great screenshot lol
---
If you're trying to catch a zepplin while it's leaving, there's a small platform on the back you might be able to jump to at the last minute.
---
Ok so you just like farming and grinding but you want this while leveling not in endgame. Because BFA is grindy af.
---
This is amazing grats on making it!
---
Funny story: most of the time I was in Dalaran/Northrend so I used a flying mount, the deathcharger sat unused in all my characters.. 
---
As long as its less than what you pay at a drinks vendor it's up to you! Bare in mind it disappears when you log out.
---
My brother who I’m playing with just hit lvl 33 on his human mage and has been going on lately how he “hates alliance so much” often talking about how he has to associate with “dirty little gnomes” and always goes on how he “hates this” after seemingly getting constantly gangbanged by what feels like a vastly more populated horde side outnumbering him and killing him.                                                                   I have it a bit better since I’m a rogue and can often stealth my way out of trouble but I’m already level 49 with my mount, 300 professions except fishing and a healthy 100+ gold stack. I too like horde more than alliance but it isn’t something that I care enough about to reroll.... I’ve tried my best to stop what I’m doing to go to him and destroy the hordies who camp him and escort him to certain flight points but he seems to be wanting to reroll more and more regardless.                                                          So basically TL;DR - yes some people want to reroll
---
It's quite disappointing really. I'll never learn of all the trees in the world.
---
accept when you look up the comments from thottbot on this quest and all from 2005 is about this line
---
Because you played classic like retail.
---
There will come a time when you join one of these groups and just watch your xp bar slide across your screen at an ever increasing pace. At that point, you will see and understand why it’s just a lot easier and quicker to do it that way. Questing can be fun and relaxing, but doing 12-15k/hr on questing compared to 40k+/hr in dungeons.. doubles and sometimes tripped xp gain over your play time.   
---
    
---
Plus those of us that have played pservers since 2010 have done the quests before, if not several times, so there’s really nothing more to “experience” other than social interactions.
---
I stopped playing retail at the end of spring, and only logged in to check mail, etc., I told myself I'd play, but didn't.
---
I play classic and even though the stretches between checkpoints are huge, and I have to run all over the GD barrens to get quests, and once I'm done in an area, I somehow find *another* quest for that same area that I have to run 20 minutes to go back to, and I keep dying ever time a humanoid runs away and tells all his bros that I'm beating him up...
---
I tell myself I shouldn't play for more than 2 hours, I've got stuff to do, but all my free time evaporates into playtime.
---
Don't. I did that with my 28 rogue, sold everything off him, donated to my guild, deleted my character and the next day I wanted him back, so I restored him. Now he's naked and useless. I'm levelling up my priest so I can dress him up.
---
It's not though. Classic wow is already a *massive* game that compares in the amount of content to games like skyrim, GTA, the witcher... games you can sink hundreds of hours into easily. It has a well crafted progression curve with a satisfying beginning and end. It doesn't "need" more. And again, there's a ridiculous breadth of content and replayability outside of the endgame (hell, relatively fewer people actually raided to a significant degree in vanilla). And if you really do manage to get through *all* of that... You can put the game down for awhile like you do 99% of games eventually and explore other titles. It's not like you need to make a career out of a single live-service game. You might even revisit it in the future, lord knows people are still replaying Diablo 2.
---
That dude is ugly
---
I mean, it's very "nice" graphically, but it's super bland and uninteresting to look at honestly. It's nice as a concept, but it's missing any kind of flavor to make it "wow-like". Feels very generic fantasy.
---
Check out this thread:
---
There’s a ton of useful tips and general info here from seasoned players for newcomers.
---
Also, classic.wowhead.com has a lot of guides worth reading as well.
---
Just google vanilla (w/e class you play) guide. All classes have been min maxed to death on private servers so all the info is out there
---
I know you're joking but I carried 3 different shields during TBC and two shields at all times during WotLK and Cata. Having the right shield is important. Having the spare shield for when all that blocking causes it to break is important, too.
---
I play a warlock and I’ve never had a issue getting into a group. In fact most people will want you for the mere fact that you have summons and soulstone
---
It's commonly known that everytime a player rezzes at a graveyard a puppy cries.
---
Way to keep puppies happy!
---
Half that group will be dead before they realize he's there. The others will be feared and mowed down individually.
---
damn
---
They also imprisoned the blood elves there, from wence the naga rescue you. Elfie boys should have taken the hint and stayed away.
---
Market PvP will always be the way forward, 30g is tied up in a Nightblade I got off of someone selling it in Trade chat.
---
Same issue
---
I can’t even remember my OG email. Wonder what’s on that account if it’s even still around.
---
He got nothing on my raw slitherskin mackeral.
---
Battle shout is very good for aoe threat while leveling. It generates threat based on how many people are buffed, split among all the enemies equally.
---
As another post suggested, prehot yourself before every pull to “cheat” some free extra threat. When facing 4 or more targets spamming demo roar is the way to go. When facing less targets mark the primary one with skill and start tabbing after 2-3hits (pull with faerie fire and do a demo roar first thing)
---
2h tanking is a private server meme, groups in Classic won’t put up with it
---
Oh, so everyone is going to get used to it, they'll fix it, and then it's going to be fucketyrama agogo when everyone still expects holding packs to be a piece of piss.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
Yoooo was this yesterday?  There was a huge Horde raid into Westfall of levels ranging 17-30ish.  I'm ally, general chat to trade chat in SW blew up. By the time I got there to see what the commotion was it looks like Westfall made their own raid to counter.
---
Oh well, fun times. Hope you got some good drops!
---
When did you have the car accident that gave you brain damage?
---
at 30 and 32 when i went all mobs were so high they resisted nova. i think basically just one didn't. and pretty much everywhere i blinked there was some other pack of spiders, crocs and whatnot that joined the fun. plus dazed ...
---
I pay them with the honor of feeding a champion.
---
Since when?
---
It sounds like the only issue is you’re on a pvp server. If four of the last five deaths were to players then that’s your answer. 
---
Warriors are very vulnerable in world pvp. They have no escape, no heal, and low mobility. 
---
I would just suggest keeping some potions on you and saving them for gank attempts. Stun (if you have one) and bandage up while they’re stunned. 1v1 a good warrior is terrifying. Because of all the lock downs. 
---
You can also be proactive and gank them first set your dominance down, show you have control of a mob camp/area. It can give you a psychological advantage. Although it can also end up with you getting pushed out if you can’t contend or they have friends or higher level guild mates. But if they’re waiting until your weak they’re likely afraid to fight you at full strength. Us that to your advantage and take the fight to them. 
---
Other than that I’d stick to lower level zones for solo, this way the mods won’t be kicking your ass so hard. Or party up with some randos and own the area.
---
What class is it? Has it been the same person?
---
Js hellfire isn't as efficient early on as r1 rain of fire because the toll it takes on you and the threat it deals.
---
Switch it up until the healer has a greater mana pool (and the retail healers learn to downrank) as well as tanks being able to threat constantly.
---
Better news is r1 rof is still effective AND you tap less per encounter. Leaving windows during a fight and out of it to balance your hp/mana with a  HoT.
---
You can also yell back. When nobody has a threat meter.. it's pretty hard to tell when you are actually going to pull. 🤷‍♂️
---
On my server people are selling them for below the vendor price...
---
Yeah you do you buddy. I top DPS charts and /dance while everyone manas up. I don't stop til the blues drop.
---
 Just added a couple days worth of scanning for Dragons Call Alliance
---
Healing SFK Heroic pre-nerf (patch 4.0) is difficult, you had to use all of your abilities and cds, mana pots and be smart about healing others than the tank. I did the Pyrewood village quests solo. It was hard at lvl 15 as a rogue, but at lvl 17 it was just slow. So to answer - difficult content is this one that makes you play at your best, one that you have be 100% and which would take a while to outgear/outlevel. And by no means i was not the best pala healer back then, but i was really giving it all. In classic if i can't do quest now, i can later, if i find party, thats good, really good, because you have high chance of meating super cool people. But if i can't i just lvl a bit and do it. Yes there are some endgame quests that a hard, but given all the info we have and that a lot of the players are simply better ( MC + Onyxia week one kills) those quests might be that difficult as before. And yes i die a lot, due my mistakes, actually i am happy i have the crippling poison so those pesky runners can stay put.
---
It depends what water you want. I'll happily always give ranked down water for anyone who wants it, because I can make 60/60 in 10 seconds. But when you hit 40 and get a new conjure water that takes 500 mana to create 2 drinks, that would be a solid 5 minutes of conjuring to create 60/60 of good water. 50 silver is pretty generous either way though.
---
Here’s a Nightelf hunter using a gun.
---
No. I hope classic doesn't turn into TBC.
---
Warrior is godly and the warrior tutorial "1 - 31" weeds out the gods from the weak all jokes aside yeah your gonna die and yeah your gonna cry, You stop after most pulls sit down and unpack your amazing lunchbox filled with mana buns. Then you go back to demolishing swines and heretics in your pathway Warrior is top tier PvP mate dont know where you got them being garbage from after the tutorial warriors and easy running's
---
Ugh, Night Elves are always so dramatic when they die.....
---
It’s just two different games. People need to realize it. They’re both WoW, but they’re also completely different. Most people I know who are sticking with retail &gt; classic are people who joined cata and later. Most people playing Classic &gt; retail are the people who actually played vanilla or tbc (maybe even wrath) and it appeals more to them. Both are good, but they appeal to different audiences. 
---
Also right now everybody is playing Classic. A lot will go back to retail when they hype dies down, mainly the first group. Most of the people in the second group mentioned above are sticking with classic and only classic.
---
Can't charge while in combat  
---
Not enough rage for intercept  
---
Permanently slowed  
---
Warrior: Guess I'll die.
---
Anyone know an alliance version?
---
Can someone please go take J Allen Brack's computers and phones away from him for a few days?
---
The only post that mentions scatter shot.  Listen to this person.  No minimum range.
---
Maybe the 1st time, but Gold runs were how I wound up running most Pug raids in LK (not sure if I did any in Cata, I don't think you need too due to LFR's)
---
Anyways, do you really want to gain a reputation on your server for ripping off 20-30 other players (who WILL complain about it) without any way to transfer servers. I do hope they keep characters server locked for a while (aside from migration from Full ones.)
---
But yeah, you could have other ppl bidding up the prices, but at the risk of 'winning' the bid.
---
So that’s what it was!!
---
Oh snap, I'm on Herod.  I'll be sending this guy a gift package for his efforts when I get back on after work.
---
I walked through burning steppes when I was lower than 20. It was empty. I died a lot and became frustrated. "How the fuck these people be talking about going to Ironforge when I couldn't even walk through this shit?" then I found out there's a tram...
---
someone's bound to do it in skyrim, and probably before TESVI comes out.
---
just sitting.  
---
So, during dungeon parties, I was sitting anytime I could but drinking only if I got low mana.  
---
Even in the middle of a fight, I sat instead of hitting the mob with my wand. In fact, that was in a moment like this my friend asked me "bro, why are you sitting ? Use your wand at least, even if you're oom".
---
There are at least a few quests that don't take themselves too serious. I also like the hillsbrad - kill murlocs questline for alliance. 
---
First one is basically kill X murlocs. Second quest is kill the same murlocs again and bring their heads as proof because the boss doesn't believe the quest giver that the murloc issue is handled.
---
I havent spent more than 50mins in quueue while im driving home from work (1 hour drive) so i havent been waiting countless hours in queue either. Im playing on EU Shazzrah
---
If it wouldn’t add up to much then why nit just reimburse the players?
---
Kek
---
Yeah you guys just had people on epic mounts ganking level 20s last night. Ill be in Ashvale tonight. Come get it :)
---
We made it so everyone can recruit and we have dedicated recruiting officers!
---
It’s just not a thing with classic. Vanilla was only your server for battlegrounds.
---
I've been using this guide personally : https://i.redd.it/wgcyg1un7fh31.png 
---
Found it on this sub before launch. I'm doing my own talent build but for training skills this has been my go to.
---
Yes I’m just saying farming the mats might not be the most efficient and you won’t actually “save” money.
---
One or two hander?
---
Either way, 19 is pretty low for lvl 31. That's less than westfall staff you get as a quest reward.
---
Maybe stop by razorfen kraul, try to pick up a corpsemaker with 29 DPS or a 23 dps dagger.
---
the whirlwind axe is supposedly pretty hard to get without someone carrying you afterall.
---
if you're alliance, there's the bonebiter axe quest at lvl 34 too.
---
Icyveins is the best imo
---
Male Dwarf Hunter. The 9nly way to go!
---
I use ReddPlanet from the Windows 10 Store
---
The OPs pic is the correct use of past
---
That’s literally not what I said lol
---
Hunter is probably one of the easiest PVE and an enjoyable play mode too
---
i spent 2 hours 1 gold and about 50 bags to new players lvl 15 or less on kurninaxx
---
Herb/skinning is good. Just have to make sure you are lvling them together as im 260 skinning and only 40 herb lol!
---
Well, yeah... He's a warrior dude.
---
Any meat. The only thing that matters is the level of the meat vs the level of your pet. Feed him, and check your combat log and you'll see him gain happiness. If he's gaining 35 happiness per tick, it's proper level food for him. If he's gaining 17 (I think), it's a bit low, but still works. Just not as effectively.
---
Additionally, read up on mob threat, aggro management, and how it works.
---
I'm not going to lie...I'd SLI my 2080ti for unreal wow.
---
Be prepared for the worgens, they're terrifying!
---
Seems pretty decisive to me
---
Glad you’re enjoying the game. Every class has its ups &amp; downs. You just have to find what works for you :).
---
Awesome glad to hear it! :D
---
Not sure if troll?
---
Mages are one of the best solo classes.
---
Warriors are litteraly one of the worst?
---
Some content can sure, not all. You post a vid of you doing endgame raids in greens and holding your own ill go back on what I said.
---
Excellent keybinds brother
---
Yeah, I remember someone a couple years ago who did something similar.  He'd always post that he's always going to buy X type of leather with CoD.  Since it was a fair price within the market, a lot of people just sold their leather straight to him.  He then created stacks of some item he could then vendor and make a profit off of.
---
What patterns do you use to create/vendor with?
---
&gt; The only good horde is a dead horde.
---
ftfy
---
Best advice, go on YouTube and look up a content creator named MadSeasonShow he has very in depth and detailed videos on this subject. Enjoy
---
I had the very same experience last night and thought that this post was about me :D
---
I personally have been liking leather/skin as a rogue and it's similar enough. You can make gear as you level to help you out, AND it's better money than people give it credit for.  You can make your leather into items that you can then vendor for a decent amount. I'm at lvl 34 right now with around 30ish gold from doing this. 
---
Skinning/gathering prof is technically more money, but it's more convenient to have LW which you'll probably switch to eventually if you take skinning so you don't have to go back and level the low lvl portions of the profession.
---
if we assume they started in 2016, we got time to upgrade our computers
---
I heard the pop was in the hundreds last week.  What's it at now?
---
What
---
Did not know about the spirit / troll racial interaction
---
Leveling as shadow priest and I think I’ve pretty much got to rotation down for healing.
---
Sometimes I have trouble knowing when to use shadow (bc breaking polys) so should I just be shooting and healing pretty much this early?
---
Because mortal strike is a high priority debuff that will knock off more important debuffs available in the raid.
---
Axe
---
Now you’re just trolling
---
Well that is just being dumb.
---
I crit in my pants is annoying too me, plus it is the 10th time i see it, so, not original. Jazz club is cool, i saw Booty Baywatchers
---
I can hear this screenshot, and it makes me smile.
---
The charge that signals oncoming doom for all involved.
---
"GOD DAMN HORDE"
---
good point. Would be awesome to be that guy, if that were the case
---
ok i turned on capslock then pressed A, then turned off caps lock and pressed l, then t, then turned capslock back on and pressed P, then R, then T, then S, turned capslock off, then pressed c.  Still nothing.
---
You dont even need a tank for rfc
---
&gt; Literally 80% of quests are collect x number of items with mediocre droprates, or collect one item with an abysmal droprate.
---
Hmm, let's test this hypothesis.  Let's count [quests from Tanaris](https://classicdb.ch/?zone=440) and see how many are actually of this sort.
---
You have the Egg turn ins, but I'll count them all as only one.  They're not kill mobs quests, you loot eggs around the world and bring them back.
---
Mux Manascrambler: 6 quests, looks like 1 is a 'harvest' quest while the other 5 are not.
---
Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle: 6 quests, 2 are typical 'kill x' quests and 1 is a 'harvest' quest.
---
Alchemist Pestlezugg: 5 quests, 1 is a 'harvest' quest while the rest are not.
---
Stoley: 2 quests, neither harvest
---
Sprinkle: 2 quests, neither harvest
---
Krinkle Goodsteel: 1 quest, not a harvest
---
Marvon Rivetseeker: 4 quests, 1 is a harvest quest

Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser: 6 quests, 1 is a harvest quest

Yeh'kinya: 4 quests, none are harvest quests

Security Chief Bilgewhizzle: 1 quest, not a harvest
---
Tran'rek: 3 quests, 2 are harvest quest
---
Andi Lynn: 1 quest, not a harvest quest

Tooga: 1 quest, *not* a harvest quest

WANTED quests: 2, not harvest quests.
---
So it looks like I added up about 45 quests, skipping over all of the later phase raid quests, and of these 8 are typical 'harvest x' quests.  Then there are some typical 'kill x' quests, while about HALF are just talking to people, traveling to collect uniques, you know, stuff with real lore.
---
Sorry, the numbers just do not support your position.  I think this is pretty typical, WoW has a *ton* of lore quests that people just blast through and don't read, then get bogged down by collect quests and whine about the game only having one type of quest.

&lt;Daybreak&gt; Raiding: None yet, most players in CST

We're a brand new guild, just started Friday. We have a mix of new, returning, and veteran players. While we are interested in raiding long term, hitting 60 as fast as possible and clearing MC and Ony aren't our biggest priority. I'd love to get a healthy enough population that we can all level together and grab a dungeon group or any quest help whenever we feel like it, and foster am ore laid back atmosphere for new players and players that are just getting back into the game alike. 
---
If you're anything like us, then classic has brought back a feeling for you that was nearly forgotten- a sense of camaraderie with nearly every player you see, knowing that you're going through the same shit together. Neither of you powerleveled with heirlooms or bought a boost from the cash chop. You both got to where you are purely from putting the time in. My goal for Daybreak is to keep that kinship alive and foster the authenticity of the OLD WoW, the WoW we all fell in love with!
---
I remember liking AoC in a lot of ways. Too bad it was an unfinished buggy dumpster fire of a game  &gt;&lt;
---
And people who care about their privacy and security, believe in using primarily open source software, want more options for customization, want a more powerful command line interface, want an easier time interacting with Linux servers, prefer the filesystem layout and userspace of Linux, want the ease of use of a package manager, and want an OS that uses significant less resources at any given time.
---
So yeah, poor people I guess.
---
&gt;As soon as any mob reached melee they would 3-shot me
---
If a mob is hitting you 3 times, that's the problem. You can usually get off 2-3 frostbolts, then frostnova, run/blink away, more frost bolts, fire blast to finish off if he gets too close..
---
Pvp yo! Don’t miss out on that exciting action at end game! Adds a whole new level of awareness during open world play time.
---
I'll send your ass to the shadow realm
---
Maybe it depends on where in the zone you jump from because I've made it before
---
Oh behave!
---
Just equip your 2 hander and dps. If everyone is unloading mobs with die fast anyways and healer shouldn't have trouble. Easier to go with the flow rather than fight trigger happy mages imo. When you have 1hander and shield you do less damage, generate less threat, lose agro, and dont get rage from damage taken. You may have better luck spamming sunders and revenge with a 2 hander instead. Killing things faster is better in lower level dungeons rather than trying to tank the "right way"
---
&gt; Youre actually the first person Ive seen that said "yeah I love classic and Im its target user, so Ill heas back to retail now"
---
They didn't say that at all. Try reading.
---
Thats exactly what you said and its why you got downvoted
---
I was showing my friend, who doesn't play, about this.  I showed him Booty Bay, then we ran through Darkshire, and up to SW, and went around the city.  
---
Then i showed up how far we had come on the map, how narrow the area we saw was, and the amount of detail in that small area.
---
He was quite flabbergasted.
---
I believe it does, but I could be wrong. They also have a specific download for classic as well. Profiles are transferable from retail to classic as well.
---
Can you do it manually?
---
Blizzard's in this for the long run.
---
&gt; "One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, we’re in the WOW Classic business forever. **Once that starts, there’s a commitment on our end that we’re going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft**. I think there will be people that come and do the nostalgia trip, they go to the Barrens and find Mankrik’s wife, and then they’re done. That’s fine. Some amount of people, however, are going to create a new Classic community and that’s what we’ll be providing.”

---
Bought pickpocket for my rogue as one of my first abilities. Got a red 6 slot from a frostmane troll in starter zone. Now EVERYTHING gets pickpocketed!
---
Once in vanilla I was playing a female troll rogue, about lvl 50, and was grinding some mobs with a couple of female nightelfs, we'd waved and stuff and just got down to culling furbolgs.
---
Then a hunter came along and marked and murdered me, the hunter, perhaps feeling safe from revenge due to other alliance around, stayed to kill mobs.
---
I rezzed, stealthed up on the hunter, and brutally murdered him while the two nightelfs watched impassively, the power of friendship more important than loyalty to faction. Then we went back to grinding mobs. The hunter didn't come back.
---
I'm PVP forever, I hardly ever gank alliance except revenge but I love these kind of interactions that the possibility of killing each other enables (FWIW, it seems most players who are grinding/questing are mainly interested in not being killed and if you show non-hostile intent like by /wave they'll leave you alone, after all no-one really wants to waste time on graveyard runs and killing is a surefire way to get revenge-killed).
---
oh jesus dude no.... hes trying to get passed the que, he not reminiscing about the past.
---
&gt; a suicidal lock who was life tapping like crazy.
---
I try to tell Locks to tap, as my mana regen is nice and high due to having WAY too much spi.  
---
But some don't understand the kink and just tap a couple times, to half health (and like 40% mana), and be done with it.
---
Then there are others who don't care about the safe word and tap down to 5% to get all of that sweet mana they crave.
---
God you're a retard
---
The amount of people sharing low-quality pictures and expecting people to appreciate it is wild.
---
The thing about that gets me is this- blizzard announced days before that Herod was by far the most popular server either name reservations, and the queues would be horrendous, and that was before you had built a community and before you even were level one, and folks still chose to  why on Herod. Therefore the only conclusion one can deduce is that either folks are ignorant of this queue from the start (and even if they were they would have realized it the moment they started), or they really don’t care and want to play on Herod with the queues.  What would change someone’s mind at this point if they thought that way from the start?
---
^this. Passed is an action in the past tense, past is a preposition.
---
You passed a sign.
---
You are past the sign.
---
Was not a weekend but close to that :P
---
Yes, you can also do stockades soon or wailing caverns if you're horde and Shadowfang keep. Especially on a guild run. I've noticed there are a lot of level gatekeepers for parties, but I being a rogue can usually out DPS people 2 or 3 levels higher than myself.
---
The fair market price of Linen Bags is always between 2 sliver and 5 silver, since you can sell them to vendors for 2 silver, and you can buy unlimited quantities of an equivalent item from vendors for 5 silver.
---
I remember calling them bubbles because of Dark Age of Camelot (in which they were little bubbles) but after 15 years of WoW I've eventually come around to bars.
---
I heard that people dont like arms because of MS debuff
---
I think about it, but then remember that I have a more interesting rotation than rogues, the essential toolkit of warriors, healing capability and a owl nuker
---
Hahah, this is one of those things that you think of in your head like "oh it'd be hilarious if this screenshot was captioned like this", but you never actually go through with it.
---
Glad you did, OP, glad you did.
---
ElvUI is doing OK at the debuff timers and cast bars, some still haven't been added (moonfire still does not have a timer).
---
classic didn't have inbuilt API for it, so all ticks counted by addons are best guestimations.
---
honestly its a bit cheaty for vanilla, since thats what mages Detect Magic is for.
---
He was tapping down to like 10-20%
---
No you’re breathtaking! Wait am I in the right place for this?
---
Looks planned. You see that circular cursor movement too often, they need to find it after being tabbed out setting up the recording.
---
Yup im in that much disbelief.
---
We did all those without crazy consumes in vanilla, I remember twins was first time we felt flasks on tanks were necessary, none of the dps used anything before that.
---
Paladin
---
lol me and 5 other alliance were boarding the ship to ratchet when we realized there were 3 horde priests waiting for the same boat. when the boat arrived we immediately booked it below deck, where after a while one troll priest waddled down and stared at us for a bit. tensions were high, and the next thing i knew he got obliterated for looking at us wrong. once first blood was drawn all hell broke loose and we killed all the horde above deck out of spite
---
Battle shout is great for aoe threat tho :P
---
Lol, there are more devices running Linux than any other OS. Your Android phone runs Linux.
---
Nah, then I just don my fancy dress and go healing full time.  Still awesome.
---
Cower isn't even needed. Just turn growl off.
---
It's actually so simple. You can just paste the screenshot straight to imgur from the clipboard, or save it in paint then upload it through Reddit.
---
"your" game
---
Zero.
---
Looks like a canadian lumberjack. I know it's supposed to be fire, but it looks like a maple leaf to me
---
At the end of the day, I doubt anyone will leave the group if you swiped the loot as a rogue. Most will just want to finish the dungeon instead of ruin the group. Unless you got some crazy good boe. 
---
Therefor, if I was a rogue. I’d just swipe it.
---
Every single PvP server will have 60/40 horde favor these days.
---
For the first time in 14 years i've gone alliance and let me tell you, Even on Mograine EU the ratio for hordes to alliance is insane and at launch this was the most balanced PvP server on EU.
---
Can't wait for phase 3 and we get BG's so i can literally stop getting outnumbered. Gonna be incredibly fun seeing hordes whine about queue times seeing as there is a huge horde favor overall.
---
Thanks for lowering my skeram queue!
---
The thing that always gets me when people talk about games is when they use the term "grindy". 
---
Name 1 game that doesn't make you play it over, and over, and over again to get good at it....
---
All GAMES ALL GRINDY
---
&gt;do larger servers have any noticeable impact on finding groups for content?
---
Very very much so. As time goes on the server populations will decline and the low pop ones now will have even less later. The full ones will turn into normal high pops. A high pop server has groups going all the time while a low pop server you may have a handful, and maybe not even at your level. 
---
I prefer the larger servers because the benefit of actually getting into groups is usually better than the reservation of farming for mobs.
---
Honestly, I don't care much for the nostalgia n all that. I'm just excited to play an old-style MMO (slower deliberate play, more focused pulls, mana management, talent trees, etc). I miss the EQ days and style of MMO, whereas everything today is high-octane fast content.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of games like Wildstar (RIP). I get why games have shifted into the realm. It's just refreshing to have some more strategic and community focused rather than muscle memory rotation and mechanics.
---
They might be too high of a level. You also can't MC druids
---
@OP: 
---
If you play solo, then Hunter/Warlock/Feral druid are probably easiest to use. Hunters and Warlocks are also used in dungeons/raids while feral druids might have a bit more trouble finding a spot (in pugs mainly i mean).
---
If you play with a bunch of friends, then any class with healing (Shaman, druid, priest) or mage will work great, as you make up for your squishiness with your friends' dps.
---
If you primarily want to focus on pve, then all classes have a presence, but some are only wanted in a specific role (i.e. you might have trouble being an elemental shaman in dungeons, but you will always be wanted as a healer shaman).
---
Warriors are kings of tanking, but they are a massive pain to level, especially for new players, and especially for solo players.
---
Based on your description i would recommend to pick between:
---
Hunter (super easy solo, range + pet)
---
Rogue (melee, no self healing, but stealth is amazing)
---
Mage (caster, can make own food/water, can teleport around cities, can go out of mana if not managed properly)
---
Not just reflections. Ray traced reflections, which these are not. It does much more with lighting as well.
---
My rogue takes fishing very seriously, little dude needs his Deviled Goblin Clams!
---
I never said it was too hard, or whatever you’re implying. I PvP in desolace last night for 6 hours. The difference is that I was getting quests done at the same time because there was not 300 players there, there was like 30. 
---
Also who cares about votes on reddit lol Jesus
---
What actually happens in the case of a tie?  Havent seen one in years
---
Now where do you guys think the best guides are at?
---
I’ve been frustrated as an old school tank I can clear fairly effectively one group at time with full cc but now the community is just stuck on an aoe mindset. Personally I’d be okay with a change where elites one punch the mage that blizzards within 1s of pull.
---
wait you dont have to klick the blobber?
---
Razer Orbweaver gamepad
---

---
Corsair Scimitar pro
---
A MUST have for mmo's for me these days.
---
I loved doing stealth runs with only druids/rogues.
---
It’s bad though. With 3 sunders I still can’t hold Aggro sometimes after taunt wears off. Tanking below level 40 is a serious skill and any big hitter in the party could ruin it.
---
It definitely works differently. There’s no glancing blow in pvp for example. So at the very least we can agree that if weapon skill above max applies, its consequence is vastly inferior to what it does in pvp.
---
Only one of the channels you're complaining about is the lfg channel.
---
I turned this on after I kept missing the Defias traitor to other people when he spawned because they were clicking accept when I still needed half the quest text to appear.
---
It literally says that in the game. Check the quest text for "Mok'thardin's Enchantment", the step looking for gorilla sinew.
---
And worst of all: devs get extra paid for making this slog(if i paid for the skip)
---
Deal
---
I’d rather graveyard cheese to save 20 min of running than endure the 20 min of running
---
I’m maining an Orc Lock this time around and every time I fail the attempt to pick a herb I figure my massive Orc hands just smash the crap out of it too roughly and thus failed the attempt.
---
Yes, definitely hold onto it until phase 3 at the earliest.  Battlegrounds come out during that phase so that will be when people begin to create and really gear their twinks.  This is THE best one handed weapon at level 19 which makes it incredibly desirable for various melee classes and most notably rogues which are one of the most commonly twinks classes in that bracket.  It will easily be in the low hundreds of gold by that point.
---
Tethered to an android phone
---
I disagree. Having a fat Mana pool is great for when things get hairy, it helps you stay in action for larger pulls, and as a direct result means you can do dungeons significantly faster.
---
Well I'm just telling ya what AH price on my server is, but clearly price will fluctuate per server. Farming these eles to sell the charms is probably good income on some servers.
---
Same here - I had nostalgia for one day, then I created new memories instead.
---
Chest in dungeon, Rogue opens=everyone rolls. BS key = The one that opened gets it(if that was the only way to get it opened)
---
Every person tali8ng US politics in general chats.
---
Yea so many times I afk'd too long on the Tram and came back only to realize after zoning through that I had just came back to where I started. Doh!
---
Thanks man I’ll gonna try it tonight/tomorrow.
---
Many thanks for the help man ! &lt;3
---
Ye but where do they even go?
---
I started as BS/Mining but guildie told me bout how lucrative skinning can be if you don't have LW'ing and my god I'm not even 32 and I already got enough for my Mount almost.
---
should have just explained the situation to the boss so he would fire the bastard
---
If they got all their mates to send nice messages it would still spam OP's chat box. It's the targeted harassment that's the issue, not "mean".
---
Join a guild. Ask guild for party invites. Enjoying layering. Profit.
---
PRIEST! PRIEST! PRIEST!
---
Tram!?! I've been running though the tunnel this whole time!
---
People look for groups on local, trade, and world on my server
---
They still have that hopping idle though, all them ‘Teldrassil Apologists’ get off on it.
---
 Remember that no matter however you have ”**passed** the time” you have never “**past** the time,” not even in the distant **past**. “**Past**” can be an adjective, a noun, a preposition, or an adverb, but never a verb. If you need to write the **past** tense of the verb “to **pass**,” **use** “**passed**.”
---
I went to STV for trolls: Multiple groups killing trolls for the multiple quests requiring dead trolls. Joined a group.
---
I went to Arathi for elementals: Multiple groups killing elementals for the multiple quests requiring dead elementals/people doing this quest. Joined a group.
---
Went to Cyclonian: Multiple people killing Cyclonian for the one quest requiring a dead Cyclonian (this quest). Joined a group.
---
Luck? I guess. More like busy server with bunches of people doing something popular.
---
Bad hunters i'd guess :D
---
this is honestly  what i expected wow to look like by now &gt;&lt;
---
You can cancel it. In private servers you werent able to.
---
Oh man, I did the quest line for the Seal of Wyrm last night, it must be one of the better ones.
---
Not necessarily.  If you aren't planning to raid just be a reliable group member and you'll end up on some friends lists or have people remember you.  I add most of the solid group members I meet to my friends list as long as they are chill.  Since I'm tanking as I level, finding a group is no problem, but if i'm trying to fill out some DPS spots, you bet I'm going to whisper the people I know are reliable and not jerks directly first before spamming general chat.
---
My theory is that they got banned for messing with streamers so they decided to DDOS the servers for revenge
---
Sadly it really is. I watched a streamer the other day farm the same 3 thorium nodes for over 30 minutes by bouncing between layers with his guildies.
---
I did the above and it worked for a bit. I loaded into an instance and it refused to load then booted me, now the same issue.
---
&gt;My favourite though was when someone got all angry at me in my whispers because i 'took' his friends name.  
---
I've had something like this happen to me on modern WoW, on an RP server. Some idiot whispered me all "you're not the real &lt;name&gt;." and im like ... "&lt;Name is randomed. If you have a friend repping a random name, you should go yell at the other 203421 people with this name on all the servers too."
---
I hear ya. A function like that would make my year.
---
Farming reputation is the most frustrating part for me. But yea drop rates get ridiculous sometimes, collect wolf paws 100 wolves dead later...1 paw lol.
---
How would you word if if you wanted to cancel SF cast fear ward on target, then cast Sf again to reapply.
---
WoW storytelling has never been about player choice.
---
Isn't he openly on TRT?
---
Congrats on having the self discipline for only playing a few hours a day.
---
Green shot is my favorite
---
I am an "old vanilla player" meaning I never bothered with private servers so my knowledge of classic is over a decade old. I have picked up exactly where I left. Always completing quests in areas, running dungeons once or maybe twice at max. I am only level 36. A lot of my guild is 50-55+.
---
I just enjoy it more this way despite it not being as efficient. There is still plenty of time to hit 60 and experience everything. As long as I can do the raids before phase 2 I have accomplished what I wanted to.
---
Yeah I feel like the vast, vast majority of people playing Classic right now came back to WoW specifically for Classic and haven't been playing retail for months or years. The only way I "go back" to retail is with a stellar new expansion next year.
---
Honestly nobody knew the game was going to be the massively popular cultural phenomenon it became, even Blizzard and the industry were completely unprepared. I remember they had to recall boxed copies from stores until they had installed more servers to handle the sheer number of people logging in so I had to get a copy on eBay.
---
I'm so glad Post Malone put this man on the map 👏
---
50
---
Then, tank as enhancement shaman /flex
---
Oh for sure.
---
You point out the argument is flawed as soon as you mention songs, movies, and books.
---
To be faaiirrrr.
---
That’s the core problem. Flying is inherent to BC. This unfortunately removes most endgame wpvp scenarios.
---
I would love to see a mod list you have going on. I love that UI set up.
---
I looked at my quest log, I thought I was here. But as it turns out, it was way over there.
---
There's no other way, the way threat works in classic the only way to pull info is from the combat log, but it isn't shared.
---
What a flex
---
Health regen is increased by spirit.
---
Sitting down gives somewhere around +20% extra regen.
---
You should get into a guild. They will help you get settled. There is a steep learning curve and its a lot easier with a guild to help you along.
---
Today is 9.9.19
---
Neatplates is really.... neat. It displays your dots with timers on the enemy nameplates as well as percent health and threat
---
Let me guess you tried to tank something as an undergeared arms warrior and got shit for it?
---
its even worse. Shield block is a huge survival spell because blocked = not crit. In my experience as a healer wipes happen mostly due to spike damage and unlucky/stupid pulls. Both can be survived with a shield. 
---
If your going in a guild group where everyone is using voicechat and the players knwo each other go for two hand, no issue there. but public I'll always recommend shield. Even if the shield is a 10 level old green.
---
I agree, but it's spamming to the point where it's getting difficult to find groups
---
why do you hate either of those things lol
---
Is... is that legal?
---
Theres incredibly good gear for warlocks at 60 that requires tailoring. Must have imo.
---
Unless you’re spamming Holy Light your mana’s going to outlast your casters (and a prot paladin’s) mana pools anyways.
---
In short: Yes! I played 1,5 hours yesterday, leveling a gnome mage to 7, almost 8. I’ve been thinking of the experience all day, and I have come to realize that WOW is about the journey. And the journey is terrific from the get go; the lore, the gameplay, the art and the sound. Keep in mind that I also played in the vanilla days, raiding MC, BWL, a bit AQ and nax. The experience last night was at least as good as any I’ve had.
---
&gt; I feel like wow died with the lich King
---
It did for me. I grew up playing WarCraft 1 - 3. Vanilla - WotLK told the same stories (plus a TON more). When Heroic Lich King was dead at my feet, I was done with caring about retail. 
---
I've tried retail several times in WotLK, but each time only lasts a few months tops. I also never raided serious after killing Heroic Lich King. I feel like that's where the story ended. Deathwing? Pandas? Alternate Universe? Faction War between the Horde and the Horde with the Alliance there too? None of that grabbed me and immersed me into the game with I was in Vanilla - WotLK.
---
Classic will be whatever you want it to be. If you want to level slowly and enjoy the ride, then do that! There's no rush unless you want to rush. Reaching max level will likely take you around 8-10 days /played, so playing 2 hours a day will mean you'll hit level 60 in 3-4 months. Once you're max level, then there are dungeons, raids, PvP, professions, reputation grinding... there's always something you'll be able to do at your own pace.
---
Why removeedd
---
I honestly hope you are right or this blacklisting us would be for nothing.
---
TRAITOR!
---
&gt; enjoy the slower pace
---
I think thats the secret right there.  The pace in Classic is so much slower that folks don't mind taking a minute to help out, especially if it saves time in the instance.  Retail is so rushed, especially when leveling, that most folks cant be assed to put in the effort.
---
Yeah it was, but it feels extra bad by 2019 standards. Almost feels like phasing when you're walking up and can see players/mobs/etc fade into the screen.
---
Troll masta race! Too bad my friends are alliance! QQ
---
I'm not a vending machine.
---
Do you mean rain of fire ? Hellfire is the one that damages you
---
I totally did this back in Vanilla as a Rogue. Discovered the pass to Burning Steppes and was all, "Ohh where does this go?" Soon as the Imps of Doom spotted me I was fucked. It ws literally after I die that someone in Redridge goes, "Dude....take the tram in SW if you need to go to IF."
---
Arena is just 1/5 of the way on though :)
---
With little to no bonus healing you'll have around 2 to 2.5 hpm for  pretty much all spells, with higher ranks typically having slightly higher hpm. Downranking can potentially minimize overheating if you're bad with cancelcasting or poor timing, but will cause you to spend far less time outside of the 5 second rule so your mana will suffer. Honestly it's not worth downranking because mana is quiet precious when leveling.
---
No, that would open a loophole for cross-faction ingame chat. It shows up as *[Player] makes some strange gestures*
---
Yeah honestly a huge part of WoW's success over time is because of the graphics, not in spite of them.
---
Some of them have no aged well and needed updating over time, but the graphics being stylised is something that has meant it's aged incredibly well. It looks as good today as well it came out, whereas if you compare it to most games that went for realism in 2004 they have taken their age a lot harder. Like [Far Cry for example](https://youtu.be/nkokvHtbZFI). A good looking game for its time, but still.
---
WoW never looked amazing, but the stylised art style has held up pretty well over time, and means you've always been able to run WoW on a toaster. I'm running classic when I'm away from home on a netbook that doesn't have a graphics card and getting 60FPS in Ironforge and it still looks pretty good
---
My local Walmart ( very rural area ) still has 2 unopened old AF vanilla  world of warcraft big game boxes with the velcro ,  may go get them tonight lol
---
Need before Greed. How hard is that? If you need an item to use it, then you need it. If not you greed it. If everyone has the same amount of need, like for an epic mount or some other general item that happens to be bue or purple or whatever, the everyone needs or everyone greeds.
---
Sorry if this requires a level of communication with your raid or group members. Hate to inconvenience you by forcing you to type something to make sure everyone understands how the group is going to function. 
---
And sure, if you have a group and you all want to need or greed everything for everyone, go the fuck ahead and do that. As long as everyone understands how the group is going to work. The problem comes when people assume they understand what "need vs greed" means and everyone has a different fucking idea. 
---
My whole point is the intent of the mechanic was to make sure people didn't ninja shit they don't need and to let people who will actually use an item get it over someone who is just going to sell it. Since it pops up with every uncommon, BoE BoP or whatever, I'm assuming Blizzard meant the mechanic to apply to everything that requires a roll. If your group wants to do it differently, that's your prerogative. But make sure it's understood. It's when it's not agreed upon the same for the whole group that problems come up.
---
I only really use it if I get the Nightfall proc. Get to use my highest rank Shadow Bolt for big number.
---
If shit hitd the fan and it's life and death then I'll use Shadow Bolt.
---
I think thats what happened on Pyrewood Village server, fking password protected world chat
---
My mage back in vanilla launch had this. It was to me one of the coolest things for a mage.
---
The weekend after a release, someone usually ddoses
---
It's copied to your clipboard, much like when you copy text. When you create a new thread and choose link, you can paste it directly into the box.
---
Then someone messed up I think, how is the extra attack power just 3 dps?
---
Nah, demand is pretty much sated and Blizz covered it as best they could.  The only reason queues have been a problem is because people aren't rolling off servers like they would under normal circumstances, otherwise they populated as normal and hit their limit at 35 servers.
---
Years ago I did the same thing only I swam from wetlands all the way to stormwind.
---
Yeah, you were right to spot the obvious. That's definitely the right place to do this.
---
yep
---
Honestly it's exactly what I expected. It's fun to play but the lack of some qol features is jarring sometimes. I really just want BC classic because I think it's the best balance of the vanilla design philosophy, class balance, and qol features.
---
Yup. Never had trouble as Lock here too. We are actually preferred in most cases due to Summons, AoE, stones, imp buffs etc.
---
Didnt you know you can quest within 40 yards of another  player!
---
I will seriously look into what class would fit me if I'm gonna start for real! I need to find something that really clicks for me I feel, feels like that is a great takeaway so far. It's the case with many RPG's, so nothing new really :)
---
It is very different from private servers, and honestly not really necessary unless you're trying to take down a particularly tough mob by yourself. Not really useful for grinding most of the time because you need a lot of space to move around. You should feel like youre very far from melee range because of leeway. It's difficult to judge the distance at first but you catch on.
---
I started playing in 5th grade during BC and played through Cata. I think that at the time I was frankly to young to understand a lot of concepts like stat priority, how to use an efficient rotation, mana conservation, etc. Coming to wow Classic has been a huge refresher, I’ve played a lot of MMORPG’s over the years, but the sense of community and grind really feel like something else. Not grindy like a Eastern MMO, not too dumbed down over years of casual changes. The dungeons have always been my favorite, and healing in classic is a super fun time. Glad I decided to hop back in.
---
I can connect, but it says I have 3700 ping and the game hard freezes for like 15 seconds every minute or so.
---
wasn't trying to be snarky. people often give their bank alts bank names like Morganchase, as in JP Morgan and Chase Bank. on some servers you will find bank alt guilds. helps manage resources across multiple characters also means you don't have to send your main back to the major cities all the time to do business, you just mail items to the bank alt and let them deal. saves a lot of time.
---
Richard? That you?
---
yes, selling your account is a bannable offense. It's happened to players who purchased accounts for thousands of dollars.
---
I use a 2 handed shield
---
Personally, just because people get *so* offended by the general non-use of the Print Screen, I enjoy seeing reddit posts of someone's photo of their screen, because I know it irritates people.
---
I love it so much more than I thought I would. I especially like training and leveling my hunter pet and keeping him happy :D I enjoy having to figure out where to go (I don't use addons) and having to travel around to the trainers. I like seeing tons of people just walking around. 
---
Anyway, yeah I like it a lot.
---
Aren’t you more fucked if you miss your first swing as a 2h ? The speed of 2h is often 3s+ so if you miss you can’t do anything for that time, with a 1h the next swing would come much faster.
---
The wand gcd is infuriating sometimes. Even as a mage, because sometimes it's difficult to stop wanding. Like you toggle autoshoot but you fire the last shot, so you panic toggle it again and now you've fired another shot...
---
I'm going to agree with you as a healer here.  It's all about the pulls.  Everything needs to be LOS pulled.  As small a group as possible so DPS can focus on one at a time.  I could care less if there was a tank or not as long as it's someone with mail/plate with aggro.
---
Best solution ever for sensitive people :)   
---
I don't even report or ignore, i just go to the "move on" part, i can't even imagine my self caring about what a guy/gal can say on "internet", a person that doesn't even know who i am xD
---
Such a waste of time pressing 2 buttons just for nothing.
---
But..this is already on the frontpage?
---
I have very similar screenshot from server launch. Ran from orc starting zone to northshire valley with a huge amount of humans chasing me around the area for a few minutes before dying
---
RNG is RNG.
---
I play every day, I say only raid two nights a week because there are 2-3 days a week where I can only play ~3 hours a night as opposed to 4-6 on most other nights. 
---
Yeah, that makes sense, thanks for the info!
---
Or you blew your load early, on a bag that you will replace in less than a week.  No shiny legendary for you
---
I only went back to retail once, and that was to remind myself how I mapped my hotkeys. I think I'm done with retail if they want to continue down the modern desgin philosophies. Retail is just that much more satisfying to play.
---
I do it basics all the time except when in a fight because you need to strafe and such.
---
Shaman have extra threat generation on attacks via Rockbiter buff, and 2x threat generation on Earth Shock, an instant cast. Warriors ofc have more tools at their disposal, but also require rage generation whereas Shaman go in ready to aggro straight away. Pros and Cons to both
---
He was begging for that to happen. What a dickhead. Good work, OP.
---
Running through Lutris with DXVK I've had superior performance to my Windows contemporaries - during the Grobbulus Server Opening Ceremony we had hundreds of people in the same layer in one location, and my client was handling it better than other people in my guild.
---
It killed itself.
---
Combine with Omni-cc to get the icon timers.
---
Haha. Between life and home and Netflix thats about what I have in gamingtime
---
And your progress in classic is forever?
---
Someone recently hear about nihilism or something?   I pity you for being such an edge lord. I bet you hear people talking about sports and every time you gotta chyme in about how it means nothing.
---
Yes, really. He's fine for an amateur.
---
That's literally one of the game tips on the loading screen as you go from character screen to the world.
---
I don't have an answer for uniformity, but if you log out after making changes, they should be saved. You only lose them if you're DC'd or the game crashes. A quick log out after major changes is always advised.
---
Not to mention the large population of other 60s that make being level cap fun not existing yet
---
Old gamer here... Do yourself a favor and try classic. I used to think I preferred solo too..I was wrong.
---
I'm slowing down leveling so I can fully immerse myself in spooky mode during spooky month ( late september /October) in Duskwood.
---
It can if you combine it with classicauradurations
---
Wow saves screenshots with prtscn so not necessary.
---
Do you really play at this low res?
---
Really going for the Classic experience, eh?
---
I'm still only level 28. 2 months from now we'll still probably be in phase 1 and that's a lot of time for leveling.
---
Do you have classic graphics mode enabled? Cause that could cause it?
---
might explain it.
---
Yeah true, once I finish my SM runs I'll be set on a weapon for a while, the Toxic Revenger is starting to feel weak.
---
From watching all the warriors on stream get kited to death. .-.
---
Simple answer Yes
---
Long answer, How could blizzard possibly know.
---
Sometimes you have to grind before switching zones, or you can travel to a completely different area. Check out the chart I linked below.  https://i.imgur.com/IGxVdVc.jpg
---
The first 2 days were just hard to log on. But I was leveling through a bunch of different classes to get a feel of which one I liked. I think the most enjoying and frustrating experience was probably on the Hunter. Started a Night Elf Hunter and it was hard those first few levels. Having to get accustomed to the dead zone, no pet at level 1, low damage, etc. Anyways the hardest part came once I left the NE starting area. It was a nightmare and the hardest part was yet to come. Having to get inside the cave to get the head of somebody was really challenging. Came across a few others that were having the same difficulty so I invited them. We finally got him down and then someone else was probably waiting on him to spawn and missed out on the tag so I invited her and we helped kill him again for her quest.
---
We then continued questing to get to the Furblog quests and came across another who was having a hard time in that cave. We were a party of 5 and spent a good 30 minutes and more in there getting lost, trying to find our way, the quest objectives and then picking up a new quest and losing our way again. No one complained, bitched out it or said anything. However, I definitely would never have been able to get through it alone on a Hunter. It was the most frustrating gaming experience. And yes I ran out of ammo towards the end so was stuck using raptor strike and auto attack. 
---
We finally continued to quest together till I got to level 10 and had to start completing the Hunter pet quests. Every one decided to take a break and I needed one as well. I have not logged back since that day which was a week now. 
---
If anything Classic thought me that the game was rewarding simply cause of our random interactions with people and grouping up to complete quests and people were just a lot more patient and understanding. The game play sucked, was frustrating and just not rewarding or worth it. 
---
Must also mention that I was playing a Mage and a Warlock before picking up the Hunter and the Mage had it worse. Out of mana every pull, dead on pulling more than 1 mob; which was hard to avoid when you have to go through an area with other mobs constantly re spawning. Was even worse getting into the mines in Elywnn Forest. That is just not fun or even challenging. Its just tedious and I would not consider that "fun and challenging" today. 
---
Of all the classes I actually did level to 7, the Warrior was surprisingly the easiest and less painstaking. I could pull 2+ mobs and still come out alive which says a lot. 
---
So fun experience was simply only fun when it involved other people. It was never fun having to quest or level up alone.
---
You should be lvl 22 when you come out of silverpine. If not keep grinding mobs until you reach lvl 22, after that get some quests at tarrens mill and do all the ones in dunhold + mob grinding.
---
I lucked out, and had 2 priests show up.  So easy with fears and heals :)
---
80% of my play time is on the weekends. I get a few hours after work some nights.
---
Snitches get Stitches.
---
Well everyone gets Stitches, so stay off the road.
---
Biggest issue I saw watching this lol. Wand is a pretty important move in vanilla should definitely be keybound somewhere.
---
Head on over the Barrens
---
Hes right. No need to use a shield till like lvl 50 stuff
---
Hard disagree. The appeal of mmos is the community. LFG/LFR, cross-server groups, and instant teleporting to the dungeon destroy the community aspect of the game. If you did bad things in a group back in the day, people would post on the forums about you and your reputation would suffer. Other groups might not take you because you're the guy who's a known ninja looter. Nowadays who gives a shit? You'll always find a match in LFR.
---
Such a bitch move to whisper someone and then immediately put them on ignore before they can respond
---
Some will.  I've been tempted.  I'm enjoying the hell out of Classic, mostly, but I also spend a lot of my time frustrated at the terrible design choices and rough edges that, admittedly, I knew I was getting into when I dove into Classic.
---
But honestly, who cares?  Some will play retail, some will play classic, some will play both.  The farmer and the cowman can be friends.
---
I don't see every server listed, are there plans to add more? Or is it just the fact that no guilds on my server have gotten on there yet
---
Btw, it looks like james guide is part of the wow-pro addon. If you don't like addons more power to ya! Just thought it may help someone.
---
I take it you dont have a kid, and honestly I don’t have one either, but I can’t imagine life making more sense than having an offspring. I imagine that’s the purpose of life. I’m from a 1st world country btw.
---
I haven't yet played today, but so far, I have not suffered any of your problems.....
---
I'm almost certain (at least 90%) of people were doing that, some did sell at a loss but a majority did include the AH cut. But this guy was just like post it for double or more like make a profit or your failing at this game
---
I've got a ticket chain five responses long trying to get my name changed because it has the misfortune to be mispronounced as a certain sexual kink. 
---
Let me just say that, while not all Blizzard GMs are fucking useless, these five twats sure are. I'm starting to think it's one person changing his name, if there were five separate entities this fucking stupid coexisting in the same place it would burn to the ground within a week.
---
I don’t think one is always better enough to make for a definitive answer, I think stoneform makes for a better anti-rogue ability and this extends to hunters too. If you aren’t too worried about rogues then it looses some value.
---
Really incredible
---
You should move to The Barrens and Stonetalon Mountains to continue leveling. From there, you will be a bit higher to start Hillsbrad and also Ashenvale (which is close to The Barrens)
---
Unlike Retail WoW, you will receive quests that ask you to travel to various areas that will outlevel you before you can begin. 
---
After the beginning zone you’ll be expected to travel from various areas just to level up. 
---
Best of luck!
---
You can head over to the barrens to level up some more then head back and finish off Silverpine elite/SFK quests.
---
Does anyone else ever reminisce on stuff you've done and question whether or not you have special needs?
---
Yes but sadly common sense is rare these days.
---
One of my pet peeves for this game. Ppl group up and just up and leave when they finish their portion of the quest without waiting for the rest of us to finish. super annoying and i keep a list of ppl who do that.
---
Weird, I dont have this issue and play with ~80ping
---
My savior. &lt;3
---
Not a tank (I'm a huntard) but I've had some success by marking something with a skull befroe pull and requesting that aoe not start until the skill is like 50% hp.  this gives the warrior a few cleaves, clap, demo etc.  i usually mention this right before the dungeon starts
---
Still seeing mostly mage/warlock tho going too hard too early lol
---
Nice clicking.
---
Uh... Better damage, better threat. 
---
There also is gear specifically made to aggro multiple targets (TF being an obvious example). 
---
That said, yeah, I don’t play a tank but the good tanks I’ve played with over the years definitely hold agro better than the worse ones. And the same person did better with better gear.
---
God, I payed FFXIV up though stotmblood, but what they did to scholar is just unforgivable. They literally robbed it off it's identity. Not to mention I heard ast got dumbed way down too. 
---
I'm so glad classic is back to scratch that itch, because I refuse to give square any more money. 
---
Sorry, I'm just salty af.
---
I think NCSoft killed it, not the community. Poor management decisions, very poor version control (i.e. dropbox ffs), and a lack of consistent staff. It was the Anakin of MMOs; destined for greatness, fell to the darkness.
---
A lot of times you're able to start a quest that is higher level than you. But probably easiest to put them off until you're the appropriate level. There should be other quests that are closer to your level, maybe some left over quests in the zone you just left, or in other zones. Try the Barrens, for example, should be lots of quests available for you there.
---
thats just the customer service experience
---
Take the Zeppelin and head to Org then make that run to the barrens. If not for the quests then for the classic wow environment.
---
mine seem fine
---
Nah, it's because most of the quests that contain the unique elements are hidden in a such way that you would never be able to find them without knowing they exist/walking every literal inch of a zone.
---
I leveled a paladin and a warrior to 60 in vanilla. This time around I'm using one of the classic guides that someone else made, and it has me go pick up quests that start from backpacks hanging off trees, tiny books hidden in the tops of houses, a single bottle on a huge stretch of shoreline, etc.. 
---
Btw, none of these these things have question marks over them, or appear to be any different from the other debris you run across in the game. Some of the things don't even give you a question mark when you hover over them -- just a cog, lol.
---
And these are the quests that typically start a long chain through multiple zones or have you go somewhere you otherwise wouldn't.
---
Ah
---
You are no human being sir.
---
The mitigation difference with shield is noticable.
---
I confused a Mage earlier today by requesting something like 400 Water as a Warrior.
---
I felt bad for the guy who had clearly leveled very rapidly yet didn't understand that water was tradeable as many times as nesiccary and that I was gathering stuff for my healer as we were about to invest 4-5 hours in Stratholme runs.
---
Only flawed in dungeons with respawning patrols. Not all have them.
---
Plus, mostly rogues have this issue and they can stealth past.
---
If that's the case, then Retail would feel much greater achievement than Classic because endgame is more "difficult" in Retail.
---
let me guess, they "cut into your profits"?
---
WAIT FOR 4 SUNDERS
---
Not in vanilla at least, I got a bunch of mail returned to me the other day with my bids saying the auction was cancelled.
---
Quest was made at 1645 on a sunny friday
---
No to hell with the horde, for the alliance until I die
---
This is the button for a screenshot in wow...
---
i played WoW since my early 20's and now i am in my mid 30's. I have to say that classic has brought back the fun into mmo's again for me. The sense of achievement and excitement is back again.
---
It’s funny because it’s not a screen shot
---
That’s the true power, these guys are literally trying to harass someone on a game for playing the game in a way that they view as “bad”
---
Who gives a shit, they’re not the type of people you wanna mess with in endgame anyway, because they’ll cry and rage. They’re not worth the time they spent writing the messages, and should be treated as such.
---
And I hope you don't ever!
---
Any streamer I watch has the same noticeable delay on casts/wanding/looting/really anything. And a lot of notable players have stated how spellbatching will kill PVP, which I am inclined to agree with.
---
I think you should try to run wailing caverns to get some gear if you're having trouble in the next zone. It will also give you lots of xp if you do all of the associated quests. Wow head has a dungeon quest guide if you dont know where to find all of them. Hope this helps!
---
Yeah... one of my guildmates is specced prot. That SM Cath run took about 15 minutes longer than it should've. Would've been better off running with him Arms + WW axe smashing down mobs with globals.
---
Hasn’t happened yet. Was in brd it was like why even put a skull mark everyone’s gonna attack their own mob while the mage spams aoe.
---
The stance requirements are what makes warriors fun to play and good stance dancing is what allows exceptional warriors to stand out. Blizzard catering to this type of complaint is exactly why retail wow is trash(in my opinion of course)
---
If you go to your discord a) it becomes less of a ghost town and b) you will find the census data you seek.
---
Anyone upset about undercutting is bad. They should just buy yours and repost it at a higher price if they're so convinced it will sell.
---
Same happened to me. :D She just kept wondering why I was crying lmao.
---
I mean they give you multiple potential builds per class and tell you exactly where to put each talent point and why, that doesn't seem too "general" to me.
---
What lvl are you? Been playing there since friday, was very quit first day but since then I’ve had no problem with groups. But my guildies at 60 say there aren’t many 55+ yet on the server
---
I watched that episode so much. 
---
I would go onto DirectTv guide and search for it to see when it would come out next and I would schedule my reciever to watch it. I was like 11.
---
I've never heard "seafood army" before, but that's absolutely hilarious.
---
Surely you aren't still subbed just to do tears every week? If so then I admire the dedication to no xp waste
---
I mean you're only always staring at the back of his head anyway, right?
---
Lol, what section of leveling does a warrior need a 500g shield?
---
Also back to the SoJ.. You gonna give it to a warrior if its an upgrade over their current 2h weapon? I mean, if the rogue took the staff when it was a clear upgrade for the warrior, he's clearly a ninja... Correct? Lol.
---
I had this tonight in ZF. Doing a boss 3 levels higher than us, no demo shout, trying to hold AOE threat on the basilisks boss with battle stance and thunderclap whilst everyone is tanking 1 mob and then getting toxic when people were trying to offer assistance and then rage quitting.
---
suprisingly decent, it's like new expansion for me
---
Right, makes sense. I wasn’t saying you should aoe right away. Just that you can single dps right away. Or slowly channel aoe (so no multishot/CoC, yeah).
---
Best fun I have had in SM was repeatedly fearing Horde through the Arms and Cath portal with Psychic Screen. Some people would take so long coming back out my fear was ready again and they would get into a loop for almost 2 mins (four Psychic Scream cooldowns). No mercy.
---
But Why Is Level 50's Looking For Deadmines And Level 19's Are Looking For Dire Maul? :////
---
Yeah, I also don't mind acting as a mana battery sometimes though. Sometimes when the tank is well geared and high enough level, the mobs just don't hurt them very much. With the extra mana, I'm happy tossing a renew or even a heal over to the lock if it enables him to keep shitting out DPS and moving things along.
---
I have been very lucky with gear and I have a shitload of spirit, so I'm happy to spread the mana.
---
Feel free to make your own group
---
Thank you for writing this i honestly didn't know
---
Exactly, people remember Wrath dungeons when people accumulated serious gear.  The other problem Wrath suffered is that the ICC phased lasted forever only with Ruby Sanctum to keep people interested.
---
Hate ppl like that. They are probably like 13 and havent sufffered any consequences from "trolling" IRL
---
why
---
You can't change lock pets, only hunter
---
Because of idiots like you?
---
Also, get a shield.
---
25 AGI gives 50 AP with ranged weapons, but also gives you some ranged crit and defense. So technically the AGI would be better, I think, but I'm not 100% sure; I don't main a hunter and theorycrafting is something I'm not great at yet in Classic. :P  
---
But I think it's 2 AP for every 1 AGI with ranged attacks. The straight AP would help with your melee, though, for times when that comes up.
---
Thats the joke.
---
Dang. Yeah I only died to mobs(went right at 30) then in her cabin two level 38s scared me but left me alone. I now plan to treat her immediate area much like druids treat moonglade
---
Tip-toe through the tulips with me 🌷☠️
---
Ya bud. Have fun leveling at your own pace and worry about end game later
---
Hey guys! Thanks for the quick imput.
---
I'll answer most questions directly here:
---
1- i'm lvl 25
---
2- I'm not really concerned about the XP but the PROFFIT, what u guys think gives the best proffit overal? Humanoids or Beasts? I mean, humanoids drop money every kill, but not so many greys/whites that you can stack and sell while Beasts drops a lot of gray/white stuff like fur, meat, etc that can be stacked and sold to npcs.
---
So, of the 2 classes, what would give more proffit/hr?
---
He can most certainly be banned for purchasing a account.
---
Your best bet is probably to come out of Menethil to Auberdine and then treck south. Anything east of Astranaar is high lvl mobs (25-30) and 25+ lvl Horde.
---
Pretty sure ago comes with crit. So if you have to choose between 50 ap or 25 agi you choose agi because you will get crit too. But I could be wrong cause I’m an idiot sometimes. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
No i was wanting to check for combat or enemy target and apply Aspect of the hawk, else apply Cheetah  
---
I wanted 
---
    /cast !Aspect of the Hawk [harm]; !Aspect of the Cheetah
---
which should allow you to check if you have an enemy targeted and apply AotH, otherwise apply AotC.
---
But it won't allow you to cast the Aspect spells with any kind of conditional that I found. I tried just running just 
---
    /cast !Aspect of the Hawk [harm] 
---
and it just doesn't do anything when pressed.
---
I'd reroll.
---
Yeh now when you play that way you’ll get an angry rogue complaint about WC taking 1h 45min without a wipe.
---
Why are you joining cleave farm groups if you want to do content and not optimal leveling routes?
---
lol says the kid who thinks amazon will lend twitch their legal team.
---
Idiots Like ME KNOW VC = Dire Maul IDIOT
---
I can't see these at work as imgur is blocked. Stupid but whatever. 
---
50 AP gives you, as a Hunter, 50 AP to Ranged and Melee. 
---
25 Agil gives you, as a Hunter, 25 AP to Melee and 50 AP to Ranged, on top of Crit(\~.5%) and some degree of Dodge.
---
You could potentially end up with more rage due to taking more damage.   
---
You're right about the weapons being normalized with regard to weapon type. The caveat to this general rule would be horde side with windfury. The extra attack will generate more rage with a slower weapon than a faster one.
---
This time he took a picture of his monitor though
---
100% not an expert lol. My statement stands!
---
`service` on Debian-based systems nowadays is a compatibility tool provided by the distribution. It's capable of handling old sysvinit services, as some packages may not yet have migrated over, but it's also capable of dispatching the job over to systemd if you tell it to do something to a service managed by systemd.
---
"skills" - no, its literally just doing an efficient grind and playing unhealthily long sessions for a week - and doing something thousands of people have already done 10 times over
---
i've been to diamond league in SC2, that is actually difficult
---
Eh, it's not like you need a tank for most of these dungeons anyways, it just speeds up getting bigger pulls.
---
Earlier today I was grinding some beasts for skins to sell in a higher level zone. I’m a warrior so pulling more than 2 is basically a death sentence for me. 
---
I had a random priest invite me to group, buff me up, share a friggen kill quest for the exact mobs I was grinding, and then drop group and send me off with a wave. 
---
Most of my interactions with players are just as wholesome. People seem to be much more willing to take a few seconds and help.
---
Clever thanks
---
Probably cost a raid tier.
---
I think same-faction griefing is still bannable. Don't think this would count, though.
---
Oh god that makes it so much better.
---
When will they learn that you’re not supposed to beat cancer, you’re supposed to team up with it against the real boss?
---
Uh, yeah? They kinda fucking own them.
---
When I saw they were opening free transfers I was pretty excited, but I think they went too far with how many new realms they made. I think if they would have made like Faerlina/Herod/Stalagg/Skeram into a single realm, it would be better off
---
Right? That wand is a good upgrade from my Greater wand from enchanting
---
Dogs folded, kids watered and homework been cleaned! Am all set!
---
I didnt. I Joined full clear groups. Apparently a lie cause they just wanted a warrior in
---
That's a nice theory, but some of us would like the chance to learn how to do that, and we aren't getting it.
---
Agility is the same as 2 AP, but slightly better too as it also increases Crit and Dodge.  I personally think the Crossbow is probably better if you are using AiS, since it is slower, but neither is the clear winner here.
---
Level 19 priest at the time doing laps in Mulgore to try and level my damn herbalism. Doing the usually fort buffs on passing lowbies as I make my rounds picking flowers. Give fort to a hunter as I'm heading towards a peacebloom node.  Get aggro from some dumb cat so i proceed to kill it and grab my node. Said hunter from earlier shoots a couple arrows to help out. Small green pouch drops. Open trade with hunter and give him the pouch and a couple stacks of heal pots. Peace homie, thanks for the help.
---
Yeah near the level cap. This is a quest for the dungeon Blackrock Depths which is like 55 - 59. The boss it mentions is level 57.
---
lol I did this the first time I was leveling a Hunter.  I main a Warrior.  Had no idea the stupid pet was going to take the long way around!!  I can't remember what dungeon it was, but I was SO embarrassed.  Luckily everyone was nice about it.  Ugh I still cringe thinking about it!!!
---
Thanks. I've got one to toggle between both, which is quite handy.
---
I just wanted to assign it to an action I would be using often anyway, like jump or strafe.
---
Saves me having to remember to click it manually
---
Yeah, if you don't mind leveling up taking a long time and then running lvl 60 dungeons for a long time.  You won't really be raiding, but by the time you get to 60 and get dungeon gear, a new tier of dungeons will be out to do.
---
WIN + SHIFT + S for instant access to the snipping tool!
---
Blue was for an offhand that increased fire magic so I gave it to the mage in our party.
---
Yeah, it's a nice experience.  
---
I saw 38 palading struggling vs 42-42lvl mobs, so I helped him take them down. He bowed and started waiting, occasionally turning behind to look at me. I understood everything perfectly, and we started tagging the mobs in turns. In approximately 20 minutes, we completed our quests, waved and bowed to each other, and hearthed.
---
I am a friendly player and won't attack anyone first while leveling, so very often I am ganked and being spat at.
---
Friendly encounters are definitely refreshing.
---
lol you're the one upset because you can't play a videogame.
---
Hey! Fancy the Bard was not a dick. He was on the Good Team.
---
Until level 60, spec doesnt *really* matter for shit. You will probably dissapoint instance groups if you do dungeons tho
---
What part of Im gonna make guild groups did you miss? Have some more lemon

Same. I did the early 8.2 grind so im good there. Raiding is still a blast and I never run more than a few m+ a week anyway. Alts have fallen off a cliff with classic but thats fine, those are just for fun anyway. B3 and Classic are gonna compete for time. Hopefully im raid logging classic before cyberpunk drops.
---
Too poor to drink... Lmao
---
I'd say the opposite. Retail sucks ass if you can't finish all your chores, classic is fun to just log in and fuck around.
---
Retail becomes "good" when you've capped all the busy work, because you can just do content you like, but that takes a long time to get to.
---
Think I'll just skip it then, thanks for the quick and detailed response!
---
with hunts are bannable be careful
---
I mean if you're on the higher end of the level req for the instance, have a good group with solid dps and a good healer than yes, you could probably get by with a 2h until a boss that hits hard.
---
You're obviously senil if you already forgot what you posted. You didn't come and say you like it better you said you take pity on op (or anyone who feels pride) for daring to feel like anything at all in any video game is an accomplishment. You called classic players trash. Claimed everyone was bashing you. Maybe a little lead poisoning effecting your emotional state and memory? Im sorry they still let you play with lead paint when you were a kid.
---
In the future you should ask the group you joined if it is a speed/farming run or a full clear. Might help you avoid this situation.
---
How to become very unpopular 101.
---
Even without dying, plate should cost more for tanks since they get hit more.
---
I tank as a bear, usually lose 20-30% durability just from being hit.
---
I personally would find something else to do/play
---
I just wouldn't feel the satisfaction of progression enough if I only played 8-16 hrs a week
---
Don't level as prot. You can tank fine as arms for levelling - if you go prot you'll hate levelling.
---
I was lucky enough to find every piece of Scarlet in there, 6/6, however, I still managed to hit 40 with just 3g to my name and 40g worth of abilities left to purchase.
---
Also a Tauren Warrior, we’re twins! I’d send a screen cap we’re I not 5000th in the queue 😂
---
You missed some quests along the way. Go back to the sepulcher and see if new quests are available.
---
Sometimes you'll get to a quest hub before your level is high enough to accept all their quests. If you continue forward you will have missed out on experience, levels, and gear.
---
Oh, even before the sepulcher. Check that hut at the far north, right by the border to tirisfal. There are also some quests up there you could have missed.
---
Shame. 🔔🔔🔔
---
I haven't been involved with addons in quite some time, but afaik they took they addon API from retail and added to classic, so it shouldn't be that hard to get it working.   I might have to remove references to: Pandarian, Goblins, Bloodelves, Demon Hunters, Alliance Shaman, Horde Paladins, Death Knights, but that shouldn't be too hard at all. Or it might just work with a few line changes to reference the right version of wow classic.  I'll look at the code tonight, I wish I could now, but I can't sadly till I get to my computer at home.
---
What error is it saying when you try to launch right now (with no other addons running).
---
That's what I said. A month ago. Don't be a weirdo.
---
Do not spec prot for leveling. You can tank as arms just go d stance and put on a shield and 1h. It is perfectly fine you just need to know how to sunder, taunt and hold aggro on multiple mobs. None of that takes prot points.
---
Just imaging that song playing in the background is wonderful.

Sounds like it thin3k you want to swap weapons, when in reality you probably want to use a macro to apply a specific poison to a specific weapon.
---
Why are you trying to coach me on aoe heals? I don’t need any advice from you on their usage, I was simply pointing out healers don’t even have that option for quite some time.
---
Additionally, I literally said in my post you take more damage with a 2 hander. Obviously a shield gives more armor, why are you pointing this out? My point was that healers have an easier time focusing one person than three, and 2 handers have more threat generation at lower levels.
---
Lastly, I have no idea what your example has to do with anything related to this conversation.
---
U knew that bc psychic is great!
---
Yeah... that Netflix sub is going to be cancelled soon
---
Yep. Legion finally made me quit retail for good. I honestly enjoyed the gameplay, but that was about it; almost everything else about the game, I hated. The endless AP grinding, the random drop legendaries that end up getting stuck straight in the bank because you got the wrong one, 4 different raid difficulties giving an illusion of more content, world content/questing being piss easy, etc. etc.
---
Not to mention each expac just kinda feeling repetitive, to some extent. I thought about the next expac and was like "it's going to be the same basic stuff all over again just with new dungeons and raids" and I wasn't interested.
---
I work in the industry, I can assure you that it does quite a bit. Most people who use Linux likely also use good privacy practices as well. Again, it's not perfect, but every bit helps.
---
Not an option as a shammy healer :/
---
Nah,  the key to enjoying PVP is gank gank gank, I gank way more then I get ganked, and that is fun!
---
One cool thing about wow vanilla was the Diablo ii influences.
---
Yeah it makes it really important for someone like a warrior tank like myself to get a ranged weapon, or some way to pull from range without assistance from another party member.
---
The hardest part is still getting party members to actually listen lol.
---
&gt; Stop hating on BfA for the way it looks; the game has never looked better
---
The art/environments and music of BfA are so good. Shame the game itself is bleh, because the artistic parts are just outstanding
---
I don’t remember ever having to repeat uldaman for any quests.  Then again I ran it so many times for enchanting over 15 years ago so it’s very likely my memory isn’t the best.  But game philosophy changes as the game is out longer so at some point maybe the changes their minds.  Ulda also has back door keys while BRD is still a massive dungeon even with the short cuts.
---
You’re not wrong. That place was an absolute nightmare. Still, I’m looking forward to it.
---
This. So much.
---
I have a macro that says /y This Ain’t Lifetap!!!!!
---
Don't be that warlock that only uses life tap for mana in a dungeon, nobody likes that warlock.
---
except male night elf. no fishing line til 1.07
---
Some content was blocked behind flying-only accessible terrain tho.
---
I'm not against flying as a mechanic, i'm against how it replaces any other travel forms.
---
Flying could be reintroduced in the future along an stamina bar: Yes, you can fly. For 30 seconds (Or 90 in epic mount) then you enter slowfall mode and the mount needs some minutes of rest.
---
This would alleviate the replacement of normal mounts for personal yets, while keeping flying in the game.
---
Yeah the Horde have a FP almost within Eyesight of BFD. It makes Zoram Strand a real clusterF to be around without stealth.
---
Right on, I think a lot of people have forgotten how important threat is or just dont realize because they're used to retail.
---
what kind of situation is this happening? 
---
I don't see how a warlock pulls aggro with dots if using kill order?
---
Are your tanks using kill order and you are only dotting the skull or are you tab dotting everything while the tank tries to tank it all of it or is this one of those cluserfuck cleave tanking SM spam pulling situations?
---
That is true. In the 1%er this time however.
---
Nah, if im doing a quest and you’re killing a group ill wait... but you’re dead as soon as i see you sit out of combat.
---
LOL YOUR SO MAD HAHA YOU KNOW IM RIGHT LMAO🤣🤣🤣
---
&gt;level 1
---
I remember ganking you guys back in the day. one of my friends Montolo I think ran with you guys at some point. Wasn't there a mage named soup in your guild? player names are fuzzy. But I remember the guild name. Everyone one i knew on horde would kill you guys on sight.
---
Nothing will ever be as dark as Duskwood during development. Needed a freaking light source to see anything there. It was so awesome.
---
That long running time between quests definitely gives plenty of time to yell things in general chat.

Well do get a shield.

Honestly, grow up. You encountered a jackass online. He won't be the last. Ignore him and do what you enjoy, as you're the one paying your subscription. Play what you want, how you want.

---
Agility is def a tanking stat, albeit a secondary priority.
---
Spirit is... less so. But everyone likes a lil spirit in their gear.

there's about 100 night elf priests in shadowmeld stacking levitates, which the lift manually removes causing it to fall again.

Sure. Play at your own pace.

I don't need to use Linux to talk about Windows 10. I literally never wait for updates. *Never*. To even pretend that this is an issue means *you* don't use W10.

And RAM? That's also never a problem. Even running 8gb RAM which is the strict minimum, won't be a problem for gaming.

You just don't know what you're talking about.

There is no way this is real. I feel disgusted if I have a plate or 2 and 2-3 cans on mine...

    sudo echo 128 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl

Shell stream redirection doesn't work with sudo. You need to do something like this instead:  
---
`echo 128 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl`  
---
or  
---
`sudo sh -c 'echo 128 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl'`

The meta needs to be adjusted mages shouldn’t be able to tank hits imo.

Bandages and vendor was the old tried and true method.

Why do you care, just don't watch him. 
---
Speaking of, can someone tell me why he is so popular, I really don't get the appeal, I watched him now and then in the first days after classic and he seemed like a regular dude who doesn't do &gt;anything&lt; to set him apart from the thousands of other WoW streamers.
---
Because you may not like it, but we all should see what peak performance looks like.
---
No! No, minimum wage is good. But the market will ultimately determine wages. In my area, some fast food restaurants are offering $10+ per hour. Chick-fil-A is offering $13 per hour! lol @ these folks downvoting me: "Any opinion that I don't agree with doesn't belong here!" But let's not go down this rabbit hole. I know this thread isn't the place for it. I recognize that I'm the one that brought the discussion here.
---
Also! I recognize your username from the other week. Always thought it was funny.
---
What did, saw
---
Yeah you cant go arms in raids only 16 debuff slots unfortunately. If ppl werent so #nochanges blizz would have removed the debuff cap.... oh well!
---
Using the IPv6 option wasn't enabled in WoW when I checked, although I did have it on. Turning it on didn't help. Rebooting after enabling then launching didn't help. Same issue, no changes. Found a website to "check my IPv6" and all was green except my browser "prefers IPv4" (sounds like a Chrome/Firefox issue right now that they purposefully set.)
---
They tried to do something like that with retail Warfronts. I think the concept is pretty cool but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. They are set at like LFR difficulty though so it really hard to tell. There is also no pvp mode which is....odd. The recently added heroic which are not queueable, so thats a start but its still just too easy.
---
does typing in caps make you feel like you're right?
---
As for Warhammer Age of Reckoning there's active and great maintained private server that's worth checking out: Return of Reckoning. Fun thing that's it's bassicly much improved over the years version of WAR.
---
Is your phone Android? because they are affected too.
---
Yeah last night I was leveling my hunter in Barrens and it sapped my soul. It's my 4th classic character through there, and I played it 15 years ago so I've had my fun.
---
I wanted a shaman to windfury lol, and that was a letdown at 30. I wanted a druid to cat form it up, and got bored at 24. Warlock gameplay isn't my thing, abandoned at 16. Hunter is 15 and easy to play but I just can't be bothered. PoE has a new league. WoW has annoying quest competition, dungeons that are just too long for me to sit down for, and raids I already did or don't want to wait a year to maybe get to. I look at the horizon of bland leveling and say... "Nah."
---
This is his job. He is a streamer. So yes, he has a very well paying job.
---
I don't even know how to respond to this. Mind blown.
---
*"Suddenly I realize that all of this, the charging worg, the incoming serpent sting, the warlock curse, the mass of horde coming to kill me, has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer..."*

I was expecting you to kill him off after you finished your part.

THESE LAND LUBBERS ARE TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT!

Yeah that’s pretty crazy.

I’m finding that the game has a whole new feel running on an ultra wide monitor at 3440x1900 with all of the settings on ultra.  The game can run on a toaster but runs great on an rtx 2080ti too.  Now if only they would add rtx support to this 15 year old game..

Wow, I'm sorry that happened! :( Admittedly, I would be pretty discouraged by that.
---
But one thing I've found that helps (as someone who has a tendency to be a perfectionist), is to just say to whatever is not "perfect," "it's okay; I have flaws too." We're all imperfect, and if we can learn to be okay with that, then I think we can be much happier overall. Otherwise, we'll always be chasing perfection in order to be happy.
---
Definitely wait for BG's in phase 2.  I think it's not going to be as much as you think because these servers are so crowded, there will be a big supply (and big demand), people will be farming.  We're way more market savvy now than we were 14 years ago.
---
Yes, if you have to compete with anyone else it gets awful fast. There are only like half a dozen total traps as far as I've seen.
---
Hinterlands, Feralas, Desolace, Swamp of Sorrows, Duskwallow Marsh
---
It's funny how the dumbest fights with no tangible rewards are so fun and... well... rewarding.
---
I had a long fight outside the RFK instance, me (pally) and priest against a Skull ?? Rogue.  We managed to juggle him between us using my bubbles like we were trading aggro, my priest had to flee through the portal and it was just me and the rogue wailing on eachother.  Despite being much higher level, i wittled him down (yay lack of power creep!) and he had to jump into the instance.  No one even died, but so fun!
---
Somewhere around 15-20.
---
I ignore anyone being annoying in chat.
---
Feralas and then Hinterlands.
---
Wahhh the open market has competition i don't understand capitalism stop doing stuff I don't like!
---
This is the third time this week I’ve seen a post like this. Where do you find these people mailing you gold and free shit?

It’s the amount they undercut is what annoys me. Like oh let me undercut this 1g recipe at 30s.

that would take no time to get to 40

My problems was they created such cool lore and thew away all the gameplay that made the previous games good (though cata was really meh).

When going in between  the cemetery &amp; Darkshire go to Sentinel Hill first. It’s a lot faster and you avoid stitches. Just take the flight each time.

I use a 2h opener and then switch to sword + board and it works pretty well.
---
Typically AoE pull goes like this:
---
1. Battle Stance, Equip 2H Weapon
---
1. Charge
---
1. Blood Rage
---
1. Sweeping Strikes
---
1. Berserker Stance -&gt; Whirlwind; by now there should have been enough auto-attacks to consume most of the Sweeping Strike charges
---
1. Defensive Stance, Equip Sword + Shield
---
1. Demoralizing Shout, refresh Battle Shout if needed
---
1. Shield block + Revenge
---
1. Switch to Battle Stance as the pull is almost over for Hamstrings and some rage for the next fight 
---
The opener is a lot of AoE threat, and switching for mitigation after saves on healer mana so I can keep chain pulling. There's some improvisation with the above steps such as using Cleave or using the shout before the stance switch to not waste Rage on the stance changes.
---
yes, viable is a subset of 'whatever,' which very well may include the entirety of 'whatever' depending on context. but you acted as if that context is its definition, which it is not.

I vendored until heavy leather. Heavy leather can get an extra 15-20s per stack on the AH.
---
Because they don't want people to have fun. They want people to share their ignorant faux-moral outrage at one streamer and his merry band of minions. They think they're making streamers look bad but what's really happening is people who didn't give a shit about either camp are going to turn on anti-streamers because they're the ones causing trouble and preventing us from playing.

Now you just need to grind an unlimited supply of Manual Crowd Pummelers.

You're preaching to the choir man, but it's falling on deaf ears.

I’m not sure it’s worthwhile to try to build up such a set at &lt;~lvl 55.  There are simply not that many pieces and they don’t give a ton of bonuses.  Better off sticking to int/Stam gear.

My alliance guild, Silent Affliction, just transferred from Herod this weekend. The ddos attacks made Saturday and Sunday a little shitty, but we're here for the long haul.
---
There is no way that Herod will be able to get down to a single layer with the population that they have. There will be more refugees, and the server will get some traction.
---
Agree with all of that my man.  So glad I finished gnomer.  Never going back there again, Ended up not doing a few quests.

Title says name. Post says face.

Just do like every mage cast blizzard before the tank even touches a mob. Seems to be the current dungeon meta and I kinda hate it.

Hey man its not my fault you don't get it.  You don't set the price the market does, people undercutting you is the market telling you that you're over pricing your shit.  If you think they are wrong buy out their undercuts and keep posting at your price but of course you won't do that because you know you're wrong.

It takes a couple hours of grinding to summon food/water? I thought you just go to a class trainer for that.

Of course I'm gonna let them, it's not like there's anything I can do about it either - but I shall exercise my right to complain! Like a true Englishmen.

*\*mumble mumble mouth full of biscuits and tea\**

I started grinding the rep at level 46, and it took me well past 60 - not really sure why I did it, other than that I felt bad turning in Feathers/Beads before reaching Revered.
---
&gt; I sort of think the whole reason Blizzard finally launched Classic was to make people shut up about it since it was constantly brought up. They put a smaller team on the project and took their sweet time, but the interest didn't die. Interest in retail continued to wane.
---
It was a reasonable choice, considering the circumstances. Back, when the question got asked during the 2013 Blizzcon, WoW was still over 7.5 million subs strong, outclassing any kind of competetition in the genre and even other games outside of the MMORPG world, despite the hate MoP got because of "pandas!!!!". WoD just got announced, as well as the warcraft movie being in the works. Diablo 3 had a disastrous 1 1/2 years and Reaper of Souls was on the horizon. Hearthstone wasn't released yet either and Overwatch was still a secret project. Also, there were no proper statistics in order to guage the interest in legacy versions of WoW at that time and the relatively small vocal minority on forums etc. was too unreliable. Oh, and I forgot Heroes of the Storm. Blizzard was on the verge of releasing 3 new IPs over the next two years as well as two expansions for two of their most renouned existing IPs. Why risk potentially wasting development money and time into a project that may or may not net a profit?
---
Then WoD happened. Initially looking promising, problems already arose with the philosophy of aiming to release an expansion every year. Then major things were scrapped or revamped, like the Gorgrond zone, the fates of the Warlords etc. Tanaan Jungle was supposed to be a leveling zone. Remember the shattrath raid? It was clear that the garrison tech devoured most of the development, which weren't completely fixed until months into the expansion. The general guess is that this is also the reason why everything at max level got centered around the mission table and the garrison. It also didn't help that the marketing was apparently so good, that the sub counted surged to 10 million at launch again. Let's be honest here. Who in their right minds could have expected **such** an increase in players just on the expansion launch, espceially since the game was steadily but slowly declining since reaching the height of 12 million by the end of wrath. Then the subs dropped down to 5 million by the end of 2015.
---
Speaking of 2015, what released earlier that year just after people realized WoD was shit? Nost, the then biggest private server. Their team set the standard for any private server after that. Their work ended up making the term "blizz-like" a meme eventually, just as much as "F R E S H". When Nost got shutdown there was a huge outcry, so much that the officialy forums, as well as MMO-C, reddit, wowhead and many more sites payed massive attention to it. And then the team got invited to do their presentation, while also offering credible statistics of player numbers and general interest. My personal guess is that by the time the C&amp;D for Nost got sent out the corporate decision over at Blizz HQ already got made to start the Classic project.
---
TL;DR: If WoD hadn't flopped **so hard** and Nost gained so much attention then I doubt Classic would have  happened (so soon).
---
You do, they take a cut that is different and considerably less than the deposit
---
look it see

You want to change vanilla. People don't like you for that.

I guess I'm out of the loop, but why are people so anal about screenshots here. I can tell whats in the image whether its a screenshot or a picture taken with a phone

Unless dropping that heal makes the group wait for the healer to drink.  Defeats the purpose of lifetap.

lol yeah thats been my life. Even If I did manage to get a charge. freezing trap... dead.

One of my takeaways here too. Great call.

cloth drops from humanoids. Wool usually starts showing up in the late teens/early 20s. You could buy wool of the auction house if you really want to level your tailoring up but that can be expensive and probably isn't worth it.

80 tailoring is fine for being level 10 or 11. Just keep questing and you eventually start coming across some wool.

1. How good is Staff of Jordan on priests and how long can you use it?

2. How many of you have rolled shadow at 60 for raids. I love playing shadow as it’s my first class in classic and want to raid with it. I don’t really know good rotations for raid bosses to not instantly go oom

Feelings have nothing to do with it, warlocks need to balance their life and mana - this feels like your justifying condemning warlocks through your own self imposed sense of obligation. Which is exactly the mindset im trying to correct with this post.

Considering that it's harassment, and not a joke, that's exactly what RCR is for.

Also, retail doesn't have the pre-Cata world, so going back to retail isn't an option.
---
&gt;The difference is that certain BoE epics sell for several hundreds, in some cases almost a thousand gold. 
---
Not at this point, and I'd argue that at the point you could get 1000s of gold for a BoE, there is even less of a reason to ninja these items because the economy is already established and you can easily farm gold.

I wonder if some of you folks arguing this even played Vanilla.

While I do miss the old days, vanilla EQ was *brutal*. There was no map. There wasn't even a compass (you had to train your "sense direction" skill, have a direction pointing spell, or throw a spare sword on the ground). Mob spawn camps were limited so they had to be claimed and farmed by a group.  You'd throw a couple spells, defeat the npcs, then stare at your spellbook for a few minutes to regenerate mana before the mobs respawned. There was so much waiting in the game that the developers eventually put in a gem-combining mini game so you would have something to do while waiting and we thought it was a great idea. 
---
 Quests were relatively rare, text-based, vague, and sometimes just didn't work right. Changing your bind (respawn) point required a caster player. Dying left a corpse with all your gear on it *and* took away a significant amount of XP, meaning you couldn't level up just by brute force. You respawned with nothing and sometimes needed to find a necromancer to summon your corpse or a rogue or higher level to drag it out so you didn't lose even more xp in a futile attempt to get all your stuff back. Mobs chased you indefinitely, until you reached a zone border (at which point they would aggro anyone else nearby the border). Travel required walking pretty much everywhere and hoping you didn't die before you could safely soulbind yourself again. The intercontinental boats had long wait times, often didn't work, and you probably weren't getting your stuff back if you accidentally walked overboard in the ocean. Crafting used a pass-fail system, where even a skilled crafter could waste extremely valuable materials failing to craft something due to the RNG. There was no auction house, so buying/selling often involved travelling to one of the trading hubs and actually talking to people (usually in the commonlands or greater faydark, due to their proximity to nearby ports, points of interest, and the wizard's teleportation spires). The reputation system means that you might be in an otherwise friendly area and then get killed by one NPC from a faction you unintentionally ruined your relations with. Or, you could start off unfriendly and spent countless hours grinding rep just so they'll let you in the front gate alive (where you'll then be killed by an NPC from a related faction with a completely distinct reputation)

I played it for more hours than anything else aside from WoW. When you bit off more than you could chew and a passerby saved your butt, they were saving you potentially hours of wasted work. When I would guide a lost player through an unfamiliar zone, they were genuinely grateful because they were likely to wander until they died and then have no idea where there corpse even was.  And I genuinely wanted to help them because I had once been in that exact same situation. It was the players against an unfriendly and grueling game world and this encouraged a kind of empathy and necessity for interaction and assistance.  The only place you really get that now are PVP-centric sandbox games like Ultimate-inspired "X"-Online games (e.g. Eve Online, Mortal Online, etc.) where you're far more likely to be ganked by other players than helped.
---
Reminds me of when I first played in BC, I was determined to get the flight paths I needed to go from STV to UC. Ran through all of the Eastern Kingdom as a low level 30. Good times, wish the world was still as mysterious for me.
---
Im at 19,206 when I filter out level 1 and im on horde benediction as well.   [http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Benediction](http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Benediction) shows 27k on alliance so our numbers sound right.
---
I remember my guild raided all the Horde cities the day Achievements came out at the end of TBC
---
"Oi mate! Fight me or I'll fuk ur wife in her stinker!"?
---
Yep. I just caught a really good moment at the time. Angle. Camera zoom. Reflection of the moon. It's all about composition.
---
Been playing this game since 2005 and have never heard of anyone using a mic for a regular dungeon. Typically only on endgame progression guild-only raid nights.
---
False.  Blizzards focus groups show you like achievements and leveling as fast as possible and getting lots of purple gear.
---
Is that on the cross faction AH only?
---
Or, better yet, buying it and relisting if it's actually under priced.
---
OP is whining about people listing items for too cheap on the AH. How stupid do you need to be? Take advantage of it or realize you're the one that fucked up.
---
Yeah even on the faction AH the deposit money is what you pay to list the item. You don't get it back when the item sells.
---
It won’t happen and the devs made it clear why. See their “not a bug”master list for their philosophy.
---
I feel the same way about the Alliance being evil
---
I actually found this back in work! I was a level 20 hunter and was determined to get a dragonhawk (I didn't know you needed BC installed) so I walked up the coast and swam for hours because it was safer than walking through the zones. Never got my hawk but I ended up here!
---
What a mad lad.
---
The downside to people everywhere is it's really slowing down questing, especially those of us that roll solo which is what I actually enjoy most about WoW.
---
You mean the arena right by the entrance?
---
Doesn't auctioneer list for like 1 copper less than the cheapest person? I always throw my silk/mageweave on the AH when I make my way back to an AH and list it for cheaper than the next person, and it instantly sells, which is great, because I want to learn my skills now, not 3 days from now.
---
Go hunter. Its very easy solo PVE and translates really well into PVP.
---
Don't forget all the headless hobby Raspberry Pies running around with default root password
---
Original vanilla nerfed parties over 5 to get roughly 5%xp. The reason people are 10 man aoe grinding is because somewhere along the line that was changed and bugged and people are getting ~15% xp per kill, making the massive speed boost and aoe output worth doing for that much xp where it wasnt worth it before.
---
Spamming 5 man dungeons in a party of 5 is still decent with a good party with an aoe comp. But I just wanted to clarify why it's an issue in Classic
---
Oh thanks. That's was fast
---
Dead man walking
---
He really isn’t anything special besides maybe his knowledge of loot drops within the game through the various expansions due to how long he tried or maybe will still be trying to collect everything he possibly could.
---
As far as why people like him it’s like a cult of personality. Everyone for some reason feel blessed to be in his presence or something it feels like. I’ve watched him on and off for a couple years for what it’s worth when I say this. He can be entertaining at times but he’s mostly just a selfish prick with a smile that people eat up. All his streamer friends and the people in his chat talk him up and treat him as holier than thou. You get something he wants you better give it to him or you’re gonna get shitted on.
---
Uhh.. Why?
---
Broiken tooth is still 1.0 speed
---
I hope they dont add the ability to see other players talents, I think that drove a lot of the toxic behavior for people to flame those they felt were running sub-optimal builds. 
---
If it shows your own I am okay with that.
---
There's at least one poop quest in every expansion
---
Must be sad
---
The issue is that number tuning actually isn’t enough to make these classes viable. Capped debuff slots is an example. But i feel like in 2019 you just need to find a group of people who don’t care enough and you guys will clear content anyway because..2019..
---
Running toward Desolace through Stonetalon on my 30 dwarf huntard. I attack a 33 warrior and a 32 rogue, kiting them down to the Chimeras and keeping them at range until they died. Before the warrior went down he decided he had enough with failing to chase me so he killed my boar before he went down. Just as my pet dies and during the warriors death animation i have a 36  mage blink on top of me and frost nova and laugh. He begins casting a frostbolt in my deadzone...and i have like 5% mana and a dead pet. 
---
But no fear, i just learned feign death! So I feign and grenade him. Already in cheetah and I'm gone. He is giving chase. No pet, no mana, no pots...nothing but my little dwarf legs moving as fast as they can. I run for a corner as i get cut-off on my pass to desolace by 3 more horde. Damn. I get to the corner and drink for about 3 seconds. Mage is still in hot pursuit and the others gave up. Mage thinks he has me, but walks into about the 3rd frost trap of his little chase thus far. I hit the gas and I'm gone again. This time i make Desolace pass and after a quick concussion shot to a warlock who gave up chasing me i get a chance to drink. The mage sees me. I see him. Oh but Warts the warthog is almost risen.  Mage blinks in...just as Warts rises from the ashes. Grenade to the mages face and I'm out of frost nova and in max range again. And i stay there at max range ruining every cast attempt until the mages untimely death that he chased me for 10 minutes for. 
---
The mage was on my kill on sight list for the rest of the day (honestly most horde are), but this one got special treatment as i made him/her proceed to regret ever chasing that little dwarf with no mana and no pet for so long. 
---
Damn I love classic.
---
Dude is on stream practically begging for it and said he didnt want to take gold donations but what do you know changed his mind
---
I’m happy with classic. Only will go back to retail if they reimplement a lot of classic-like features in it.
---
Yeah, poor drop rates are one of the inexcusable poor gameplay elements of Vanilla. Most other "outdated" mechanics can at least be explained with some reasoning that made sense for 2004, but not poor drop rates. They actively discourage you from grouping with friends. As a Druid, I've found myself declining most group invitations because I know I can kill mobs faster than most classes so being in a group inevitably results in slower gathering of quest items. It's a an awful mechanic, and definitely something that I'm happy retail fixed back in Cata(?).
---
Hello everyone, currently I am a lvl 25 Paladin on Bloodfang PVP server, obviously on Alliance.
---
I'm from Italy and I am a totally new player to WOW, so looking to learn, I'm looking for a guild who welcomes casual players interested in PVP. I prefer a tight community of few people that the guilds who seem to have hundreds of people who barely talk to eachoter. If any guild is welcome to shoot the shit with me along for the ride, I welcome it, just contact me ingame.
---

---
Deviate Delight in NA was 12k alliance chars to 10k horde last I saw census data. And that was after free transfers off of Grobbulus. Before that we were super Ally heavy.
---
The good old bait dollar in the tip jar
---
People playing this game are older and have a better understanding of what to do there won’t be any finger pointing till later on when people get bored of the content.
---
You’ll probably get a decent amount of wool just from doing normal questing and dungeons, so no real need to farm anything for it unless you want to. But your tailoring is quite high already for your level.
---
No, leave me alone.
---
We are 1.12
---
All pets are normalized
---
Pick whichever has good family and you like the looks of the most.
---
People were raiding below 60
---
I don't think it's a fact that they're overpowered. I think because tanks/healers, specifically warriors/priests, were in so little supply in vanilla that people rolled them this time around to try and secure more invites.
---
&gt;I'm asking because you are talking about sharing and I don't see any other way for people to "share" an item that will be bound to the person who equips it.
---
Exactly, you can't.   Which is why you let the person who can wear the damn item roll need on it.
---
Bear tanking is a lot of fun. The problem I run into is all of these Frost mages freezing things in place, which causes them to drop my threat and just attack whoever is closest. So now I need to try to tank a few in a couple places but can't pull them into the same place since they are still rooted. That and aoes over take threat swipe pretty fast, so it becomes chaos each time.
---
I personally think you enjoy retail after reading this. Are you a retail player mainly?
---
I doubt they can push the fidelity much farther with the current engine. That’s why we need WOW 2 so there will be room for improvement and a new engine gives so many possibilities
---
O ya!! I need to reinstall triviabot.  Loved that thing
---
Losing any potential combo points to disable fireball for 5 secs. Not worth
---
Just praying I get Mask of the Unforgiven as soon as possible
---
No, I'm not counting that.
---
Yes, seems buggy.. maybe visual... I will check combat log next time.
---
I thought everyone was all for a free market.
---
Did you pick the Whirlwind Sword instead of the Axe?
---
That was fun to watch. Yep all true. Poor Hogger HAHAHAHAHA
---
This is great! Thanks for putting in the time. Have an upvote.
---
&gt; I don’t really know good rotations for raid bosses to not instantly go oom
---
Mind Flay spam, if you have spare mana mind blast, but over the long-term mind flay spam wins.
---
Keep SWP up, and vamp embrace for most bosses.
---
I'm literally trying to explain to you how it is, not how it was or how you think it should be. This is how the community has been like for years. Everyone rolling need on SoJ is the normal thing to do. Like, you think a single guild that's actually taking on the game is going to blacklist anybody that rolls for jackpot items? Not even remotely, lol. Because that's how the game is and how's its been for almost a decade of vanilla wow.
---
I have about 5 some are gold chat spammers and other s are   
---
Salty players who think they know the game better than you and talk down on you "because they played Vanilla Wow back in the day"
---
Disgusting.

I let everyone roll but I always take the silver from the chest. Everyone wins

wow, someone is feeling daring today huh
---
The poor guy. I feel his pain.
---
This. As you need to do at least two runs for alliance quests anyways its actually a good way to split up the instance in "Quest run" and "Archaedas run"
---
Maurodon  is  similar.
---
XD
---
wow thats badass. any idea why they didn't do that in the game?
---
I’ll be honest Classic has made me itch a bit for retail for the much better end game content. With that said I have no interest in an AP grind to do it.
---
if i happen to notice a few wolves in close range, ill aoe and move on. the actual good spots are either taken or an enemy will getcha.

No one should ever PrintScreen again in this sub. Just to drive these people crazy. :)

+1 the 2nd fix worked.
---
If it's the DDOS problem, they haven't fixed it yet (tried less than half an hour ago). They are blacklisting all the Linux desktops and Android phones (tethering).
---
For Linux there's [a workaround found by the community](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1lncq/reddit_linux_wow_classic_players_are_getting/ezoopln/), for Android there are a few apps that can let you change the TTL but they all require the phone to be rooted unfortunately.
---
Amazing!
---
I do! That's my cleave weapon :3
---
I've still got alot of places to explore, but loving every bit of it as a new player to the franchise
---
Lol I think every warrior has a list.
---
I agree. Lately, I just feel guilty playing classic. It has nothing to do with the amount of fun, it's just the grind and the commitment. I could read a book or work out or fix something at the house for instead of 150 hours or so I would be sitting in front of the computer. 
---
I had three level 60s in vanilla so I do look at reaching 60 as "Ok, finally I can start playing the game."
---
You don't have to analyse the market, a quick glance at general sales and an estimation of effort required from yourself is good enough. Geez' who's gonna be that anal about it?
---
you sit on reddit all day strokin your neckbeard hippie boy ?
---
I dunno. People love to claim this, but hardly anyone did the hard versions of BC dungeons before they were nerfed into the ground.
---
Every goddamn mob having 360 cleave and being cc immune was frustrating as fuck. Invisible mobs that would show up and 1 shot anyone but the tank. Especially with timers involved.  
---
The Cata dungeons were hard, but they were tuned much better than the BC dungeons.
---
Okay good to know. I’d assume the skill after getting 5/5 TM is good too to keep generating rage every 3 sec.
---
Lol. At least I care enough about this game to get angry. Never happened in Retail.
---
So buy those auctions you see at a lower price and put them back at your price? It's not a difficult concept. You make them happy and then you make more money and you're happy. I don't want my auctions to sit around for 24 hours then get mailed back to me  for me to have to go list them again or vendor. So I undercut you depending on item a certain %. Like I said I'm riding on my mount farming more and more which means in time I'll be able to put up more auctions make more gold and be happy. My undercuts aren't 10s (unless it needs to be) but it could be 4s 50c maybe 6s, maybe just a measily 1s. but as someone else stated you get nasty grams. But my steed and I will keep on grinding.
---
Some people are such snowflakes lmao sorry OP
---
It should be. Tbh I remember stuff being a lot more deadly in vanilla.
---
What’s this rep grind? Classic noob here.
---
They might not offer it lol
---
Agreed, that entire zone really is an "I'm being chased by half the zoo" nightmare
---
I most definantly am haha. Rc bad!
---
Probably about the same here, boy is Barrens chat full of some shit.
---
Yep!
---

I agree my rogue brother. We must roll need on this for every hunter who Need rolled on cruel barb.

This sub should commit to never hit PrintScreen again... just to drive the screenshot people crazy. :)
---
Me, lv 24 hunter and my buddy, lv 20 hunter ran from wetlands to hillsbrad to see the areas we leveled in as kids. We used to play as horde, but went alliance this time around for something new. We made it to hillsbrad, and killed a couple lv 27 mages, priests, and shamans. Never had more fun in wow than last night. Classic is wild as fuck.
---
&gt; Geez' who's gonna be that anal about it
---
You, apparently.
---
I’ve seen it done both ways leveling up and at the end of the day it all comes down to individual skill imo. Had a 2H tank in WC who couldn’t hold aggro at all, last night ran RFD with a 2H tank warrior and he was amazing. Same goes with the warriors running 1h/Shield. 
---
Same skill disparity exists with your healer and it’s best to ask before you roll up with your 2H and end up wiping.
---
I got guild but i want straight healer who can discord and want be friends. Trying make memories and bonds. Let Reddit be how we connect lol.
---
&gt; "it's not retail so manage your threat or die" speech before a dungeon starts.
---
Eh not really. It's pretty easy to just AoE down entire dungeons at a time, and even as a clothie it takes a while for a single mob to get through my ice barrier and start lowing HP. And that's without taking into account slows, freezes, snares, kiting, and other defensive tactics. All in all, I'd say threat doesn't matter any more in classic dungeons than it ever has in retail.
---
They're not butthurt, it's just a way to finger wag at people.
---
there no rage leveling a mage.   warriors use rage silly
---
You realize all you Veterans made  retail how it is.
---
I hope they implement a poll System like Osrs has it.
---
Im glad you enjoying it.
---
So you're basing this assessment on quantity, not quality. How many notable quests have you scrounging items for turn-ins, *to include reputation grinds?*  
---
The Light's Hope reputations, the AQ grinds, grinding elementals for Hydraxian Waterlords rep. All are grind quests, all take a lot more time than most of the rest of the quests. If you're focused on the time it takes to complete the quests, rather than the number of quests, it definitely feels like the grind X mobs for Y items are greater.
---
Yeah, like someone else said, you can make it part of the story! :) I wish you the very best in your future adventures!
---
Oh wow, is that why wands have such high DPS?  I guess it makes sense if casters don't get any AP scaling for them.
---
I’m not sure how popular this idea is, but if they made a WoW2 that was literally just classic wow in a modern engine, I’d be all the fuck over it.
---
&gt;This is not retail/BFA so why are people treating it that way?
---
I bet a fair amount of the people playing classic started sometime after wrath where a lot of that became a thing.
---
Unless you're melee DPS, chances are you will be OOM because you're using too many high mana wasting abilities, and having to stop and drink after every pull which does less DPS over all. Staying paced is way faster than just burning shit down and having to drink after every pull/mob. Plus you waste healer mana (if the healer is nice enough to heal you).
---
Smooth is always way faster than clusterfuck blitzing, threat management is and always has been a part of vanilla and I've seen people kicked from parties from constantly pulling aggro. At lower levels it ain't big of an issue (but if everyone is doing it then it will just be making things difficult for no reason) but as you get higher it's something to watch out for, especially when certain classes can get killed easily and it doesn't help when some classes pull aggro and they use their drop threat ability (like feign death) and the mob makes a beeline to the healer, or a hunters pet growls then gets 1 shotted and then the mob makes a line for the healer. 
---
Getting into good habits at lower levels is better especially in PUG's where everyone might not be up to everyone elses level. If you're group that is skilled and experienced, that can handle it fine, but other wise it's just making life more difficult cause not every group is built the same.
---
You are clearly not that smart, notifications is a simple tool along with the ability to multi-task. You should try it sometime you ignorant moron.
---
I got killed by 4 different groups of hordes while waiting for a slow respawn quest pickup just before the respawn. The run back was perfectly long enough so that I could see them riding away on their mounts right before I could rez. Wasted over an hour just standing still in a cave and corpse running. Fucking annoying.
---
Imo it makes the world feel much larger and immersive. I made the trek from Darnassus to Sormwind and it took a while but was nice taking in all the scenery and chatting with some players i met along the way. It also makes getting that mount at 40 so much more meaningful.
---
I think this is number 8
---
I agree. I love the fantasy and playstyle of tanks. And I wish low level dungeon tanking was more representative of late game tanking.
---
I would be okay with tweaks after the initial phases roll out. 
---
The problem is there is if you homogenize everything you end up with retail... that being you lose all class identity. I would be fine with tweaks but let's be honest. Ret isnt viable short of an overhaul...
---
Shadow is okay... Boomkin is okay... Prot Pally is okay... tbh most the "bad" classes are only bad because they are not the top 3 in raw dps... the utility the bring though sometimes still insures they have a raid spot.
---
Buying/selling gold is literally the same as buying/selling any services. When I have my car worked on, someone else better and quicker at it (or with more time than money) exchanges their time for my money. Gold sellers play wow to make gold and sell it to people to pay their rent. Not really any different.

Whirlwind Axe IS a tanking weapon! I promise!

This guy gets it.

Idk what this helps me with but thanks for the smile lol.
---
Ooooh. Now this is a real pro tip.
---
Don't really care if I DPS, heal or tank! Just wanted to tank for dungeons.
---
Think I may just pick back up my level 24 feral and just bring that up to 60.
---
Okay but what is Chestnutz?
---
Thank you, you too!
---
Hahahhaha
---
Lol nice, you'll have the chance to get them again soon!
---
Seriously..
---
I believe most efficient.  It takes so much time extra to do guys a couple levels higher, so in the long run you get less XP over time.
---
Leveling a warrior main with a druid alt. Warrior picked up skinning and herbalism and druid is alchemy leather working. Since my warrior is usually always ahead my druids has the best gear for his level with leather working. It's been working out very well so far. 
---
The rest xp is enough to keep your characters on the high end of the zone mobs which is the best benefit in my eyes. This is especially helpful for my warrior being 2+levels ahead of the zone I'm in. Warriors need all the help we can get. Current levels are warrior 32 and druid 31. Planning on going to 35 on warrior this week.
---
The common misconception is that it's driving "us people" crazy. The truth is I'm trying to help you out. Feel free to imagine that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZn283W62VI) is me though.
---
You can also not have auto attack on by default
---
Totally agree. I love the tanking aesthetic.
---
You’re making so little sense. I feel like you’re slow.
---
They are viable in a casual setting.
---
Yes, you can use the spec even for smaller pulls in cases where you are questing. Also the good aoe spots can be open during off times or you can do some instancing with groups.
---
No reason not to go aoe spec for leveling unless you want a bit more single target damage and the random freeze proc for pvp.
---
Looks like those speedhacks from a while ago. Could also be lags.
---
Everytime you finish editing macros, type /reload ui.
---
A guy just helped me do an elite quest he didn’t even have yet. It was The Den quest in Stonetalon and took a little bit of time.
---
In return I went to ashenvale with him to help him with a hard quest I had already completed.
---
This type of thing seems to happen every time I play. It’s great.

I play waaaay too many classic games. Couldn't get half of them running in 8 or 10. I do have 10 on my laptop, so it's not like I'm avoiding it entirely... but I won't be using another OS for my gaming PC until I find games which I want to play, but can't without switching. I know I could just dual boot or start relying on VMs, but I don't have any issues using 7 so I just don't have a good reason to change yet.
---
I think that it highly offensive to the undead sense a lot of them have no jaws

Rattlegore Alliance. That explains it...I just recently started getting medium leather and haven’t even skinned any heavy leather yet. I’ll take a closer look at medium/heavy leather prices in the AH and go that route. Thanks!

I don't remember hearing about this at all

Man I can't wait in 2 more levels when I can do a full Mara run so I can get that bow.
---
As much as I like guns on my dwarf it's so loud

I thought Rogues got 1 AP from both Str and Agi?
---
It's draining as hell no matter if the party is frustrated or not. The counter point to "tell the tanks it's not a big deal" is tell the dps to calm the fuck down. This isn't MDI.
---
1 I mained a paladin from vanilla till wrath, never once did using a pot concern me. Have you ever asked if a tank had to health pot. yeah hypocritical of you doncha think?
---
2 lol at healers who dont wanna heal. Boohoo it's so hard! Who could possibly handle healing SM GY or deadmines! Defias miners hit too hard! Put a shield on! Give me a break. If you wanna wand mobs, go quest.
---
3 you dont understand that if a guy with a 2hander lost aggro he would have lost it even earlier if he had a shield you moron. That's a moot point.
---
I wish you luck on your journey, it's going to be rough on you I think. Maybe you will grow, though I doubt it as you seem to know everything already!
---
Very relatable.

My best friend who I met online in WotLK, became an IRL friend around MoP and onward, passed away about half a year ago.

We've been grinding WoW for many years together and he was super excited for Classic. I almost didn't end up playing tbh. It's not easy.
---
You’ll be good! I had a similar situation this weekend. Fresh 20, ready to run deadmines as a DPS with my new Druid cat form. Was definitely nervous because I hadn’t run an instance in a while. It took a long time to find a group, and once invited they asked if I could bear tank. I have zero experience tanking, so I let them know but said I’d give it a shot. Was super nervous I wouldn’t be able to hold agro and would die a bunch. People were super understanding whenever I lost agro, and I just closely follow the party’s instructions on who to pull/where to pull mobs. Ended up clearing without a single wipe, and I even got Smite’s Mighty Hammer! An unreal feral Druid weapon.
---
There are some dungeon drops that you will have for 10-15 levels so I think some of those are with rerunning for. In general though, running each instance in your level range for all the cloth you need isn’t worth it.
---
&gt;Druids also have animal forms.
---
So you want your healer to go oom from shapeshifting for some auto attack damage?
---
When I’m confident my mana is fine, I heal the Lock. When I’m worried I’ll need the mana, I do not heal the Lock. 
---
I have yet to have a Lock complain. 
---
If you’re stupidly life tapping to the point I’m wasting mana keeping you up, you need to be casting less expensive spells.
---
Yeah I've seen the same. I would guess that some players have forgotten how important stance dancing is or dont understand how to make the most of it. It is not existent in retail and I think it can be confusing to players that are new to classic warrior.
---
Does it fight for you? Can you command it like pets for hunters?
---
AH, vendors give too little for it. Once you get to higher levels the AH prices are pretty good, mountain silversages are over a gold each.
---
Guess you missed the blue post where they put in a hotfix to stop layer hopping by utilizing a progressive timer. They'll let you hop one, or two, but by the time you're able to hop to a third layer, the mobs would have respawned in your original layer.
---
me (20 warlock) and another 20 warlock buddy were questing and both low on health at the end of an escort quest. some unknown level warrior rushed in and tried to gank us but didnt go how he had planned, lol. We just dotted him up, feared, and kited him to death. Poor guy but felt good, lol.
---
painful  as this is, I also remember the patch where they changed quest items to guaranteed drops, and as an altoholic it literally killed any desire I had to make new characters for quite a long time.
---
Those gotta be some way back classic games.  I've been gaming since DOS but can't say I'm playing any games these days that would require Win7.  I understand where you are coming from at least.  
---
I'm sure ya don't wanna plunk down the cash for them again, but GOG does a great job at repackaging them to run on modern OS.  I've played Duke Nukem, Descent, etc.
---
If they went with the original patch and not the later the game would not get popular.  The game was more punishing.  Content harder.
---
I am 100% for new content though and minor changes.  Like, give paladin tanks a taunt so they can actually be used.
---
Resto Druid here.
---
Generally speaking, I always throw a Rejuv on my warlock that's life tapping.  The HoT is always best effort though.  How well, and how much, and how quickly i bring him up to full health depends on my current mana level and if i have summoned water or not.
---
So the thing about intellect is that it only increases your mana and crit chance, and you need a good amount of it(60 at 60) for 1% crit. Having more mana is always great, but you're also a warlock who can just lifetap. Spell power on the other hand actually increases your damage done. So while it can be a toss up on if you want slightly better sustainability or a bit more damage, I'd go with the damage every time. In general spell hit(before cap) &gt; spell damage &gt; spell crit &gt; stamina &gt; int &gt; spirit for a warlock. Obviously if an item gives a shitload of int compared to something that gives barely any spell power you should go with the former. The Hypnotic Blade + Orb in this scenario are *far* better.
---
not until you use a combo-generating ability on the new target
---
I'm enjoying it. One of my old EQ buddies (who has stuck with retail since Vanilla) refuses to play Classic. He said he would hate the absence of all of the QoL improvements. I told him that's what makes it great. He's still a hard "no" but I might be able to talk him into it. Let's see what the community is like in a month.
---
Tell the man he no take ur $3
---
I'm not arguing from an authenticity stand point.   I'm arguing that is the established norm, not whatever nonsense ya'll idiots are coming up with on the fly.
---
"Not enough rage."
---
Really enjoying everyone's responses of wholesome stories about their cross-faction encounters on here.  Should probably put a NSFW tag on this for the PvE players.
---
People can’t even log in right now via Linux...
---
His guides seem to be based on private server drop rates. I tried the jaguars he recommended in SoS and their drop rates are 1/4th what he said.
---
Dude, you giving out water is literally gold to other casters.  I'm glad you are having a good time, and just you being you is making the game a better place.   Azeroth gets another chance, and people like you are exactly what it needs.   No matter if horde or alliance, you are a boss
---
No it’s obviously the hillsbrad scepter drop rate
---
Stop texting to change the game. Play it or dont.
---
Omg you poor soul...idk what realm you're on but if your home is the Westfall server look up the Dunder Mifflin guild. We're all very willing to help out. Our highest level member is also a WoW noob lol.
---
lmao if that's what you wanna call it you neck bearded hippie boy.
---
your trolling keyboard warrior fingers are always ready waiting for that moment to spout out nonsense so you can rub your cheeto dust finger tips through your neck beard while readjusting your bottle cap glasses on your pimpled covered grease face.
---
3 sec cd on blink 4 sec left on Iceblock you can do it !
---
He could drown himself couldn't he?
---
I appreciate you put in at least a little more effort then the previous 8.
---
Just skip the first garbage content patch and go straight to ulduar
---
I got mine on my first run last night. Worth the travel time to get there as an alliance player. Good luck
---
I just swim/walk all the way to westfall, and visit the abandoned house on the great sea shoreline on the trip.
---
My raid is taking one shadow Priest to raids.  Ooze of Fairbanks mains a shadow Priest and is raid leader of a guild which cleared Naxx on pservers
---
Shadow is viable.  Boomy, lol RIP
---
I don't think it has much to do with when people started playing. It has a lot more to do with what people enjoy about WoW. Each version has things they do very well that the other doesn't, and they offer completely different experiences to players.
---
For example, I really enjoy the challenge raiding and progressing through a raid tier at endgame. It's pretty much exclusively why I play WoW, so I know that Classic really won't be for me. I'll play around here and there to visit old versions of zones, but that's it.
---
Here are some resources i've been using and ive been posting them for other people.
---
[Classic WoW Tanking and Threat Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOGCaOhCZvo) this is a good start to understand threat.
---
[So you want to Tank in Classic WoW? How to DOMINATE as a Tank in Vanilla.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04cVuaOsEjo) this talks about skills and and tips.
---
[Skarm Tank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ/featured) has some good gearing tips and more strategies on tanking as druid, warrior or a paladin.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scarlet-monastery-classic-dungeon](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scarlet-monastery-classic-dungeon) This is a mega guide that links to info about every dungeon and tells you the mobs to look out for and what the bosses do.
---
Sooo sp for damage... lmao 
---
But yeah this. Sp is technically always best... even for healers because it means your mana does more for the same amount making you more mana efficient.
---
Int only increases mana pool and crit chance...  which is needed for healers but still isnt better than just have stronger heals.
---
Healers should focus SP&gt;MP5&gt;Int&gt;Spi
---
Dps Should focus Sp&gt;Int&gt;Mp5&gt;Spi
---
&gt; Attack the same target as the tank 
---
My god. Please don't do this. I'm never actually looking at the kill target. It is going to die and it won't hurt anyone.
---
OMG, this was my first experience playing WoW so long ago. Killed 6 hours trying to guide my wife and brother in law that way. 
---
"Why is the quest to get to Ironforge so hard?" Still gets a laugh.
---
Seriously, good times.
---
All that extra mana is useless to a dead warlock
---
this is what i do; with my pile of  loot from questing and a dungeon run, vendor everything grey/white, AH anything green and up at vendor price +10%, rounded up to nearest whole silver value.  
---
there are players who are leveling and will appreciate the cheap upgrades, and there are players who game the AH and will appreciate the easy profit of reselling an "undermarked" item, and there is me: the player who is just happy to sell something above vendor price at all.
---
When you come up on hogger and the armbands quest and there's like 30 peoe around and everyone is teamed up and having a blast.  It's pretty great.
---
That's a good point! I hadn't thought of it like that. :)
---
I got it im againts flying too. But walking till lvl 40 is little stupid imo. But yeah its great feature because its classic.
---
You killed many threats of azeroth by lvl 40. Dangerous bosses, you helped with reducing population of dangerous animals. Like boars. And then you walked away like peasant. :)
---
No hate im glad you enjoying the game.
---
Personally would only recommend this as a leatherworker to sell Deviate Scale Belts, but it is definitely an option.
---
They may do this for retail but wont be for classic.
---
Even now? I haven’t seen anyone saying this shit since like day 4 and even then it was just one Druid who had a broken quest.
---
I think they added them back in Legion, but like the rain for example in BFA isn't as "heavy" as it is in Classic, with the extra fog effect it can get on top - which is a nerfed version of what Vanilla actually had. 
---
BFA is a different beast though, and IMO for that version of the game they should be taking weather tips from FFXIV - they have the best ones hands down for what Blizzard would want.
---
I’m sure it changes later on but as a warlock rogues just seem like free kills leveling. I’ve had rogues open on my while I’m fighting mobs and all I do is sac my voidwalker then dot and fear.
---
Lol?
---
Here is an example world-first 60, and if you don't think its a wide spread abuse you must have disabled your chat entirely.
---
Literally 10 people are calling out for layers every minute, to either respawn mobs or avoid any kind of PvP skirmishes. Anything that makes whatever their objective is more efficient.
---
Yeah I guess he could lol.
---
I’ll have to test this out later today
---
Not anymore it can't. Microsoft Word has all those extra menus and behind-the-scenes processing so Microsoft can gather your data for its monthly ritual data offering to Satan
---
#nochanges damn it
---
My alt priest’s name I frigoffricky.
---
&gt; the healer could be spending some of their mana/cast time on dps instead.
---
Yeah holy fire is such a great use of my time and mana lol.
---
Long ago I played an alliance druid on a Horde dominated server. I remember playing WSG and with randoms on alliance, we consistently lost because for some reason the horde were really good at it. However. I was pretty excellent at holding the flag. I remember extending a WSG game for over an hour giving my team the time they required to get their shit together as I was chased by 3+ horde. I don't remember if we won that one, but it felt good to take the attention of so many players because the Horde just couldn't cap.
---
And the usual things. People wall-walking to get on top of goblin towns to kill people of the opposing faction without the gaurds being able to get to them. 
---
The first week that the PVP system came out, SS and TM were an all out war for the entire week. Skeletons stayed on the ground for days, and there were infinite number per character, so it was just completely white between the towns. The battle front would push from one town to the other, then the gaurds got involved and pushed back to the other town.
---
Zeppelins for horde were NOT safe, there were no guards on them.
---
STV was nearly impossible to level through or complete any quests for Hemet.
---
One of the first times I went through STV I engaged a shaman who was at low health. He was five levels higher than me, so quite a struggle. I was able to barely defeat him, but he wasn't releasing to the graveyard which I thought was odd. Thats when I found out they can self-resurrect. I don't know how, but I managed to beat him a second time. (I was speced as spell power cause I was a noob), boy that must have been embarrassing for him.
---
If you look back, BC destroyed the meaning of zones and factions; 
---
- Suddenly both factions had paladins and shamans.
---
- There was no choice to zones. You started in one, went to the next, then the next (compared to vanilla/classic where you could go in different directions all over the world).
---
- Everyone did everything alongside the other faction, shared the same vendors/auctions and everything. It was like they erased the existence of factions just for the sake of making things easier &amp; casual friendly ... not realizing they were destroying everything that made anything unique about each faction.
---
... but BC was still good because the dungeons were spectacular. 
---
However, WotLK just continued destroying immersion and scale and meaning to pretty much of everything... and it was that trend that broke the camels back.
---
Pretty good dagger that can be soloed under the right circumstances.
---
This is how I see it, I love the leveling experience in Vanilla, but I've completed it on two vanilla characters, and one Blood Elf in TBC. All I want to do is get 60, so I can start the farming for everything else endgame wise.
---
Not gonna lie, if this was how WoW looked, I would quit my job and become a gold farmer.  I know graphics arent everything but imagine a WoW that was smooth, crisp and looked this badass?  Imagine farming boars for hours on end because they are the only mobs not being spawn-camped, and the boars looked real?  Or actually being able to see the tiny candle on the kobold's heads, so it makes sense when they say "You no take candle!"  Just imagine....
---
Vanquishers is a great upgrade. Wasn't familiar with sword of omen tho because I've been ally my whole life. Horde has it easier I suppose.
---
Haven’t enjoyed an MMO since Wrath. This includes cata (at which point I bailed ship after being a day one) and 5 other MMOs. Call whatever the heck you want... having a blast and excited to play every day when I get home. Haven’t even started raiding or join a solid guild which was for me the most vivid and insane fun socializing and accomplishing goals.
---
Preeeeeety sure this isn’t just nostalgia. Nostalgia is part of it but mainly the game in its original form is just that damn good.
---
Imagine being mad that someone values their time more than a few bucks in their bank account.
---
I was an altoholic for years until I started playing a Druid. Haven’t thought about rerolling since
---
Someone can explain? My realm doenst have queuques.. Is this for mining, skinning or to get more mobs?
---
I'd log off and wait in the queue for 100g
---
In a random bg you are lucky to have one healer on your team let alone a good one that team fights and keeps your melee up. Only in premades do warriors really shine.
---
Go here:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/instances
---
Click on the instance bosses you're interested in and note their levels.
---
Example: I'm 28 and interested in RFK, so I check the first and last boss levels. 28 and 33, which is fine.
---
I'm also interested in SM GY. Bosses range from 32-33, but my 28 tank can't find a group that will invite them. I have a feeling it's because 2H tanking is hot right now, which I don't do.
---
A mouseover macro is a macro that casts a spell at the target your mouse is hovering over, rather than who you're actually targeting. So if you're targeting the boss and want to dot up any adds summoned, you don't have to click them individually or untarget the boss. Or if you're targeting the main tank, you can just mouseover the dps to put hots on them.       
---
         
---
    #showtooltip Spellname    
---
    /cast [@mouseover,exists][] Spellname      
---
This will cast something at your mouseover target if it exists, or your normal target if there's no mouseover, or you if neither target exists and it's a beneficial spell like a buff
---
[Here's a video I found](https://youtu.be/Ig-opUGFZIw)
---
Dunno if its viable, I'm not high enough level to try it yet
---
Because op is making an obvious joke and you've taken it seriously to the point of rebuking. Hence retard
---
I mean lets ignore that co-operative play is in everyone's best interest and hold our allies' mistakes over their head like a weapon. This is the best way to group with players.
---
\*Captain America walks in\*  
---
\*sits down\*  
---
"So. You have decided to play on a PVP server. Again."
---
Wtf Runecloth bags are only 3g on your server? I'd actually buy them at that price over skills lmao
---
Usually that's what players tell a DM when they have meta knowledge.
---
Oh how the turn tables!
---
They don't know what they're talking about. Shadow priests can out-DPS hunters a lot of the time.
---
Come on bro did you read the rest of the paragraph?
---
I present you these beauts I got last night.

---
I was killing turtles in Hillsbrad up the river that runs by the WW axe quest.
---
Got jumped by 4 ?? Alliance.
---
Ran back, and waited in stealth as the dumbos tried to take down the red drake.
---
I waited, in stealth, and when they were all at 50% I ran in and popped Blade Flurry and a thistle tea and annihilated them, sprint then Vanish to hunt down and open up on the mage who got aggro from the drake.
---
I then watched them waste their time as they went up and down the river looking for me to get revenge.
---
Good to be a Rogue.
---
4. You have been at work for 3 hours and 27 minutes but have only browsed the new section of /r/classicwow
---
Honestly who gives a crap if it’s a screenshot or phone pic. If you can see what the image is doing to make it relevant to the post then it actually fucking worked as intended.
---
Someone hit 60 a couple hours earlier. AHHH SHIT, shut the servers down. its all ruined.
---
If you ever feel like removing some of the running monotony, there's checklist-like leveling sites that walk you through every step, start-to-finish. Ive still had to read plenty of the quests to see what to do, but it arranges everything in an efficient manner so I'm not backtracking the same path a dozen times. 
---
The one I'm using has really neat tricks that makes me view the world in a different way as well. For example, in the orc/troll starting area if you die in the northernmost part of the vile familiar cave (it's a really narrow window) your ghost will spawn in razor hill. Ressurecting there will let you pick up the Cul Tiras and raptor egg quests, cutting some backtracking out of the picture. Another part Im happy about is it minimizes the amount of dungeons you need to run, relying primarily on quests. This gets me seeing the world more rather than suffering through a dozen WC runs.
---
Well yeah, that way there's a stationary group that the mage can blink through and frost nova to drop threat... What the heck were you doing before?
---
I was trying to do quests there and the place was swarming :(
---
honestly id like bliz to keep classic servers of all of their old releases
---
You couldn't be so further from the truth and it's pretty embarrassing for ya to be so blatantly retarded like this. Also I shave and live above ground making FAR more money than you, can promise that. BUT you just keep on going and acting like a moron while I sit back and relax and watch you continue to make a constant fool of yourself.   
---
You should try logic sometime, it might help.
---
This is my new copy pasta
---
&gt;Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
---
FTFY
---
Not sure but he seems to deserve them being rustled
---
Each dungeon has a range. I think you can usually get away with having one party member on the low end, but this varies based off class.
---
For example, if you have 4 peeps at avg level and a low DPS you'll probably be fine. But if the healer is the lower level then you'll want either your DPS or tank to be on the higher side. If DPS isn't fast enough to burn down boss, then healer will run OOM. And even if DPS is high but tank isn't great, then you'll constantly need to be healing and also likely OOM.
---
My response to this would be that if the warlock is efficiently using the mana gained, the DPS increase would shorten the fight and the healer would be less likely to go OOM vs.saving mana for the tank and extending the fight.
---
2.65 is 2.65.
---
Well yeah hunters dps is bad.
---
This is why I like my go-to name. It was a randomed name from vanilla but it's always been available for me no matter which server I was on
---
Don’t give up! Got mine on my 5th run, and omg WF procs feel so good with it.  Was like a 15 DPS upgrade from my green axe 😂
---
Yes exactly
---
But you miss out on sweeping strikes and extra dps, functional, but slower.
---
I'm angry my Beast Slayer enchant doesn't work on Tauren lmao
---
The server I was on last night voted and DM is Deadmines for now until Dire Maul is out lol. VC was confusing the (surprisingly high number of) noobies.
---
so you're telling me that you have  access to a statistics that show what the majority wants?
---
My favorite is when people personalize a thank you message. I've seen a few /yells like, "Thank you for the buff, BadBoudica, you are the tops!"
---
But even just a simple emote is more than most give, so thank you!
---
It's not like there are constant trains of 30-50 alliance going through hillsbrad. 
---
My 1 hour jaunt through there yesterday took 4 hours because of ganking. I will never forgive alliance players. Once I hit 60, I will go out to my way to camp the ever-loving shit out of every single lowbie I can. 
---
^when classic gets you to hate the other side more than the whole expansion built on the idea
---
I was going to say to wait for name change service but the barber may come out too.
---
When I played vanillia I had a level 29 paladin twink that I loved to play. He wasnt crazy twinked out or anything I just hated leveling.
---
I accidentally leveled him by discovering a play on my way to the wsg battleground portal to look for new rep rewards. I was so pissed at myself for leaving him that close to the next level.
---
Well I decided to level him to max which changed to level 70 when tbc eventually came out and I still wasnt there with him. So when I finally got to 69 I made sure that I dinged by discovering a new place to finish with what started it all. I loved that paladin
---
also, create a damn cancelform macro for your forms so you can insta-switch to get out of slows
---
A lot of people have already said why it's a great game even if you're a so called casual.
---
I'll only say this: RP-PVP servers are amazing, and if you can spare $15 to try it out, do it. Unless you absolutely hate the game/graphics/lore/etc, you probably won't regret it.
---
What? Asking for affirmation doesn't mean it isn't the norm.
---
Left mid legion, came back for classic. Is it bad that I have yet to log into retail?
---
My kids and wife roam the living room, and they are way past my level;) I stick to the low level man cave!
---
And by "Game" i mean guy
---
Gaming chair that moves, wireless keyboard and mouse, ottoman with a hard surface mouse mat
---
So, it's not safe to open it in sandbox mode. Thank you for clarification.
---
Ive been tanking for 15 years and you just changed my life
---
Ahh, thank you!
---
Healthstones and Bandages is what I'm use to as a Lock .........

You know if you just bought as many as you could afford you'd be less poor.
---
The most interesting thing about this book is that it lists King Terenas as a rare spawn in Undercity.
---
I was beginning to worry that this sub does not know how to meta
---
That's the benefit of having played the old RTS games!
---
I don’t use an add on and I always undercut. Sorry my stuff is selling and yours isn’t.
---
I second this huuuurd. I was playing Vanilla WoW on a "I Buy Power" Laptop that was built strictly for music and I ended up playing wow w/horrible graphics. Now on a AMD Threadripper 1900x w/a 1060 6 Gig GPU w/16 gigs of Ram and I truthfully don't feel like its new but it's definitely pretty AF, like I've never witnessed Vanilla WoW b4.
---
30 Dwarf Prot War on Bigglesworth - LF a guild thats relatively casual, and active within the guild, and not super massive.
---
I won't be able to dedicate any raid nights because of work/family, but going when I can and getting into some PvP is always fun. Usually always down to tank a dungeon or 2 when I'm on.
---
What does that have to do with the post?
---
Agreed that one class per week isn't cutting it. Only issue with a daily rotation is having to double up on at least two days. 
---
Alternatively, we could stick with a weekly thread, but have top-level comments for each class and discussion below. So instead of one class per week, it's just a weekly "all class discussion" thread.
---
\*whistles\*
---
Yeah, the cellular connection is the only point that matters, I would imagine (unless iPhone tethering isn't having the problem, but I don't even know if you can tether on an iPhone... I know I tried it back in the day w/ a friends and it was horrendous at that time.)
---
Oh, so you ask a rogue to unlock the lockbox for you and pay them, yet you tell the rogue to give you the locked chest?
---
Interesting entitlement I see.
---
I love that he is ok posting someone elses name on reddit, but not his own
---
Lol right? Op's ignorance does not make classic less of a solved game
---
What?no parachute thingy?
---
Is this Stalagg?
---
Can't be. Not enough red.
---
I've only been in 2 hours... but yes.
---
I never played BC but what you're pretending isn't part of classic is exactly why I quit that game 15 years ago and didn't come back until many, many expacs later when quest design had improved. Playing through the goblin starting area a couple years ago after not touching the game since vanilla was mind-blowing how much shit had improved. There were still a few quests where I just went to Y and killed X bullshits, but there were also more unique and engaging quests that weren't just shoehorning random mob murder into a questline, if anything it felt like the mobs to murder were only there because they were in the story and questline. Whereas WoW is just a big map peppered with random monsters and quest designers seem to just pick a group to be the quest target almost abitrarily.
---
Is it hard to get used to? I’m pretty well adapted to being an active clicker (on targets, I still hotkey/custom bind my abilities)
---
Been playing since vanilla and I literally never noticed that. I guess my brain said *of course* they are attached with ropes or something.
---
Not for everyone
---
noone said anything because there isn't much to say? there are no elite quests, there are queues for killing named mobs for quests since not many people are there, best you could expect is what, the chicken escort quest? even asking for dungeon is done in LFG channel now. I have been in Eastern plaguelands for an hour, I have MET half a dozen people while questing, yet noone said anything in general for the same reason. 
---
You want your daily dose of barrens chat? Go to barrens.
---
I agree with one small caveat:
---
There is a large number of noobs in Westfall that refer to the dungeon in that zone as "DM". It has always been "VC" for the simple reason that Dire Maul will be in the game and that "DM" is reserved for that instance.
---
Wow classic just isn't working. /s
---
This. Or maybe DeM and Dim. Heh.
---
HandyNotes with HandyNotes_NPCs (Classic) plug in
---
I asked for water the other day in a dungeon because I forgot to get more, and the mage didn’t respond, then rolled need on gear he couldn’t wear at the end, and even I didn’t call him a rude prick lol. Some people need to chill.
---
Sounds like a chair problem.
---
Because the original Azeroth map was a janky mess.
---
https://i.redd.it/7uveo9ilea021.png
---
But but but dual wield fury is bad for leveling! /s if it isn't obvious
---
 I got sick of using the WC staff and swapped to dw fury at 25 my kill speed spiked immediately because my fury gen became immensely better.
---
Its a faction, not a team.
---
You got this correct. I still enjoy retail, but I don't care at all for the content that you auto-queue to get into (LFR and LFG Dungeons, and the expansion feature warfronts/islands). Raids and mythic+ dungeons in guild, even mythic+ pugs are fun. People whine about the 'gate keeping' that web resources like raiderio, but it helps filter people by prior experience if used correctly, and you still have to make social choices. The loss of server identity is a double-edged sword, as the region merger allows everyone to find people to work with as 'dead realms' were becoming a problem, but it does take away that sense of knowing people who do similar activities.
---
Same. I actually really like warlocks as a druid tank. If there is a pull of more than 3 targets, I have to lock life tap to low and hot him before I pull for free threat.
---
See i'm a shit tank and i havent ran into this. If you're getting that kind of vitriol and behavior, you are probably doing something wrong. People in classic generally arent toxic for no reason, unless they're genuinely pants on head stupid. Server rep matters too much for brainless flame to be justified.
---
Bandaids and life tap ftw
---
17 to be able to get in, level doesn't matter for healers (aside from greater aggro range if your group is trying to skip trash pulls.)
---
Yeah Light leather sells for crap on Kromcrush, the medium and heavy hide sell good though and honestly even if I'm selling it in the AH at vendoring prices I'm still helpin someone Plvl up their LW'ing.
---
There's no propaganda against having children. But it should exist, looking at you asia, africa and middle east.
---
Good man.
---
So you're agreeing with me that needing on all BoE items is not the norm.   What are you even arguing then.
---
We never camp, just kill as we quest. 
---
    - the priest
---
That lucky resist on the fireball at 5% lmao
---
Felhunter interrupt is melee range I think, I'm pretty sure he just LoS'd the MC and yea, the priest thought he completed the cast.
---
Obviously it has some effect on the economy (more mobs, more resources etc.) but my point is just that it accelerates the general progression on all the servers, because people are able to play much more efficiently than they would without abusing layers.
---
Yeah some guy dodging ganks on a PvP server might seem like nothing, but without layering he would either hvae to log off, fight back or change what zone he was lvling in. With layering you just get invited and keep farming meaning that you will play the game much faster than you would without layering.
---
I would go as far as to saying layering goes against the spirit of vanilla, yes it was a necessary evil to manage launch issues, but I think its about time to start getting rid of it, especally now that abuse is getting more and more widespread.
---
Or threat in general.
---
Most of the times taunts are just threat increases, along with dropping threat simply being a reduction, and not literal attention grabbing skills like retail (how often have you experienced the likes of a tank capable class or hunter pet smash the taunt button in a bad situation to buy the squishy a few seconds before the tank can get aggro back?) Makes a huge difference.
---
On top of that you actually need to significantly OVER aggro a mob to grab it's attention. This means that if you are tanking a mob and have 100 threat, the healer suddenly hits like 130 you in turn need to jump to 169 threat to grab it again!
---
Reroll imo
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
There's a reason shit like this ends up on Reddit. It's not the norm.
---
I have had a total of 1 bad interaction in classic so far. And that's more than made up for by the huge majority of people being much cooler and more social than I'm used to even in MMORPG-S.
---
Yeah, I have dual monitor setup, would be a waste of time for me to do it that way or anyone else with more than one monitor. Thanks though.
---
Yes I’ve had this several times. You can still move but your spells and the mobs go into freeze
---
It's been two weeks and I'm back to retail.  I agree though that most people forecasting Classic burnout where expecting it to take months.
---
I might be an exception though since I play retail with the same people I played with in vanilla 15 years ago.  The community that Classic players are so desperate for never went away for us, we just have to put a little more effort in to coordinate our schedules.
---
Yeah I don't hold back either. Happened last week in SM Armory runs (maybe cath dont remember which one) but had a tank ask we doing large pulls or small ones. I told him decent pulls play the safe side for the first few lets see how we do aoe wise. AOE was great mages and lock worked good together. I said Ok you can grab more, and after 5-6 times of me asking him we had to kick. I explained to him about the group wants faster runs we asked you to grab more (i would be 75% mana after pulls) There's a fine line, kicking people isn't necessarily toxic, but attitudes in trade chat, or if you're horde on whitemane and know the world chat fiasco. I think a lot of people's names because known in the community. It's like basic training I stick to myself so noone knows my name, or they know it for good (random resurrections, good heals etc) I think a psa would be amazing, i also think the people who do the things we don't like didn't play much of vanilla or even Wrath.
---
I'm in the same boat. Whats the best way to gain rep to access the flyer in bb? im at 1500/3000 and the little goblin mages only give 5 rep/kill
---
Its probably the biggest impact right now on the userbase and its "blizz's shiny new toy" -- there no confirmation of that, but its awfully suspicious that that lawsuit came down and here we are getting DDoSed a week or so later.
---
Def check out the game they tried to make, they didnt even really try. Even the names they changed, were to just other Blizzard names.
---
I play in vr with custom models that turns everything into naked nelfs
---
My favorite mage related harassment is when people act super indignant when I don't accept their invite when they roll up on me 2/3 of the way through a big AoE pull.
---
People are often excited to play remasters, or just go back and play an old game they used to play. However since it's an *MMORPG* for whatever reason there's no way that could be fun. 
---
It's some weird logic people use at times, I tell ya.
---
Yes and no. When they're told they don't need to be tank spec or in tank gear for leveling dungeons, they take it to mean all leveling dungeons, and so you get a lot of warrior tanks at level 40+ who struggle because they're DPSing-to-tank and haven't actually done much else.
---
I have ignored some chat spammers/bots.
---
Apart from that, whoever I would ignore because of toxicity/ninja/etc, I'm instead writing down their names on my blacklist. Hopefully a good AddOn for these people will show up.
---
Hahahahahah, first time I've seen that name allowed. Dude made it all the way 2 be able to make Mageweave bags. \*slow clap\* Guy deserves a medal.

---
I agree. But I think "the argument" is that its ONLY nostalgia and you dont really like the game. I mean, you're right, there's obviously more here. But their argument is that you didn't even like wizard of oz in the first place, u only liked it cause u were x age when you first watched.
---
I would think classic is the same as any game. It's fun. People will play. Some will prefer retail, some won't. Some will burnout quickly, some later and some not at all.
---
For the amount of ppl that resubbed strictly for classic (myself included) I cant imagine itll ever get to the point where blizzard isn't profiting from it.
---
Let's all point and laugh at this moron that thinks blizzard spent thousands of dev hours to watch classic wither into nothing after naxx!!
---
People keep spamming it to AOE farm with mages, or to respawn mobs for quests, etc, might just be because im in a public guild but they keep spamming this like 40 times an hour.

---
Blizzard has Devs who specifically assist in making sure the clients operate in Linux.  It's tested versus the anti-cheat systems and with the wrappers by Blizzard.  However Blizzard themselves do not Officially support it due to logistics of making it a native client.  This way, they can input minimal work to ensure the client will still work in Linux.
---
This post was meant to call to arms the people to find a temporary solution, while also reaching the attention of those who perform that work to ensure this is not a permanent problem we will face.
---
Both goals as I now understand have been achieved.  But thank you for your input.
---
I've never played retail :)
---
I only used those numbers as a random example. But I'd be curious to actually know how are the layers distributed. If a layer has X capacity and there is exactly 2X players online, what happens when more start joining?
---
May want to look at some of the newer ones, as he did do some during the closed Beta.
---
The greatest of all tit foes.
---
Are you on a PVP server? If so, leveling and going quests might be difficult. On my server, there is an obvious Horde/Alliance imbalance (favoring the Horde). With layers, it seems most shared zones have a majority of Horde questing, which makes it incredibly difficult to complete quests. I am constantly getting jumped by multiple Horde, so I don't stand a chance at killing them unless I'm in a 1v1. It seems most Alliance players are experiencing this and have thus jumped into dungeon grinding in order to avoid the PVP.
---
Travelling quests aren't good quests. Quest design has improved massively over the latest expansions, like cats and beyond. People read quests I retail just as much as they do on classic so I'm going to take everyone's impressions of classic and retail quests with a grain of... Nothing, I'm not going to consider those opinions at all because I have little to no reason to believe anyone is actually paying attention beyond whatever stereotypes they want to reinforce.
---
I think it's fine in this context. I don't think someone is particularly adverse to the attention when they name their character after Jeffery Epstein.
---
That’s true. A warlock can also summon themselves for this purpose. I do this with randoms while questing too when I need to hearth and come back to a location quickly
---
Sounds like communism to me
---
Viable for what exactly?
---
Buncha scrubs in this commentsection, your most likely on a ovp server in a contested zone and cry about being ganked, unless you literally get camped, get your revenge when ressed or at another time and move on to the next battle, I also havent experienced any high levels killing lowbies at all, those are ok to corpsecamp tho.
---
I think it’s actually pretty at home. Some of the people on this sub will fanatically praise classic and talk hard about retail.
---
That's what Cold Snap is for...
---
I've played like this on 2004 :) nest way to lay, but back then it was laggy as hell.
---
Do you not have a firewall? Why on earth would you think a VM hides your public IP?
---
You seriously think that he's going to grab your IP out of the thousands of requests that website received and target you with a DDoS?
---
Whys it seem like your camera goes way further back than mine.
---
That's the thing.
---
Warriors are also pretty versatile with their spec. A Deep Arms warrior can lay out some serious DPS, but can just as easily tank any 5 man or even UBRS.
---
So you want to do DPS, you gear and spec to do DPS, but then it's time to do a dungeon, you don't have to find  a tank, you can just jump into the role.
---
A mage can't decide to tank a dungeon. . nor a priest.
---
Even deep fury spec'd warriors can tank 5 mans.
---
Lastly, I think gameplaywise, Warriors are a bit more involved. You have a lot of skills you have to use, and only so much fury to use them. An Ice mage is going to hit Frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, Nova, Cone of Cold, Frostbolt. .. blink repeat.
---
Warriors have stance dancing, and different skills in each stance. In PVP I've switched from a 2 hander to Sword and board so I can shield bash a horde mage, then back to a 2 hander to whirlwind, and dual wield for the faster attacks and rage generation. . all in the same fight. Add in some hamstrings to stay glued.
---
I've mostly played dps classes but when I play warrior, I always have a lot more going on.
---
You can swim from STV to Westfall. Just have to stay close to the shore. That’s how Horde get to DM.
---
Warlock here: just manage your Mana better.
---
Realization that not every mob need 4 dots and shadowbolt spam was enlightening. Use a wand once and awhile
---
I couldn't get classicauradurations working...
---
I found nugrunning to be the best for what I needed (rogue buffs and stun timers).
---
Give it a shot, it's really simple and clean.
---
No plans to go back to retail however im not spending every waking minute playing wow classic like I was the first week. I think I've evened out and now il just log in on weekends and the occasional weeknight
---
I have been running with a 2h warrior tank in BRD with me healing as a shadow priest spec’s without issue

---
No, it's literally isn't.  It's a minor issue that has been addressed and debunked (several times) by Blizzard and besides hyperbole, no one can produce more than a couple of examples it having any actual affect on anything.
---
Just delete the post. I didn’t even know what I was looking at. Took me like 45 sec to find the mageweave bag
---
The stairwell part is giving great exp and hasn’t been patched by Blizz , so yes
---
As a warrior, are we playing the same game?  Agro generation pre-60 means that people who are not the tank are going to pull threat, often at no fault of their own.
---
I played from launch to legion and the only people I ever heard ask for those things (in my experience) were the casual types. The kinda people who log in for an hour every other night.
---
It’s faster than questing if you have even a decent group.
---
Y tho
---
Let's not talk about this weekend... :/
---
relegated, but true.
---
Why would you have to double up two days out of the week? Just reset every 9 days instead of forcing a double up two days a week.
---
Lucky you, I still see it
---
&gt;KOS hordes - like 15
---
Do you mean to say that there are some horde players that you don *not* kill on sight?
---
Alliance always gotta start shit out of the blue.
---
On Deviate Delight (RPPVP) everyone has been ridiculously out-of-the-way kind.  Help with quests, random trades of gear upgrades, and just general discourse has really enhanced my enjoyment of classic thus far!
---
Pets will ALWAYS he valuable. 
---
That being said the game is not even a month out, people care more about gearing up and mounts. They dont have the funds to buy cosmetic stuff.
---
Sure, but that doesn't mean that he actually does.  He doesn't have the same look that someone taking a supra-physiological dose of testosterone would, which is why I believe him when he says he's only taking TRT.  He also seems way too concerned with his health (not wanting to even try adderall, for instance) to take higher levels of testosterone.
---
I came back after 10 years to play classic let’s just say I’m not gonna log into retail
---
Yes?  What did you think you were insinuating with?
---
&gt;what allows exceptional warriors to stand out
---
Back in Vanilla, I loved gnomer. But then, I also played prot pally and tanked gnomer, SM, Maraudon and Sunken Temple repetitively while everyone was telling me prot pallies were bad.
---
I’ve been killing these Gelkis ones lol what’s the difference may I ask?
---
Pets have different modifiers for health, damage and armor, they are not all the same, therefore it is not “normalized”.  For example a bats modifier is 1.07 for damage while a bears is 0.91.
---
You don't get to decide what topics people are allowed to talk about and what they aren't.   I'm blocking you now, bye zealot.
---
You should take a phone video and post it as proof.
---
Yes, you can. Hopefully they'll stick around like your high quality "M&amp;M's" post. Oh wait..
---
I macro in a shield for shield slam for spell interrupts. Use 2h axe/sword 95% of the time otherwise since i'm spec'd arms/fury even though I'm forced to tank in most groups
---
I think I would have asked "My fucking trash?" then blocked him.
---
&gt;and every other major game producer for the last 2.5 decades.
---
Uh, no?
---
somehow I wish he would have discovered this at lvl 60. The rage at that point would have been massive.
---
Did the same with a Rogue as a Priest, mortal enemies in faction and class but we both took turns tagging the kobolds in Arathi. &lt;3 I'm glad we weren't the only ones.
---
People camping entrance to WC just murdering Hezrul every time he spawned made it damn near impossible to get that quest.  It was insane.
---
Most people aren’t familiar enough with the mechanics to know where you can go under leveled and where you can’t.  Been a while since I deep dived combat mechanics, but as I recall, ranged attacks don’t glance, and yellow attacks from rogues and warriors don’t either, so you can get away with fighting things 5+ level ahead of your level as long as you aren’t gettin crushed if you are a melee or hunter class.  
---
If you’re a caster though, your spell hit rate goes straight down the toilet at enemies even 4+ levels above you, so it REALLY depends on what classes you are bringing and whether the casters can leech off that final boss they can barely hit.
---
I wonder how people still find communities if that would be the case for everyone.
---
Look at the flicka da wrist
---
Ha. I wouldn't say that. I7. SSD rt580 card. 12gb ram. 27infh 144mhz monitor. 
---
I paid $700 Canadian for it. And it rips (as it should the game being 15 years old )
---
Wow, i know this is an oldish post but I like your UI a lot.  This is basically what I've wanted my UI to look like. I love the flexibility of ELVUI but I just don't like the futuristic look. Unfortunately you cant add backgrounds to most Bartender action bars, and i don't like detached icons floating around on screen. Looks like you solved my problem! If you could send a link I would be really appreciate it.
---
I walked all the way from Stormwind (with tram) to Shadowfang keep on my 22 mage when I got a dungeon quest for the first time ever. Good times. Took me 4 hours and lots of dying in hillsbrad and silverpine
---
Private servers have a significantly different audience and objective then blizzard. You aren't going to get the same experience.
---
Private servers also messed with balance in many ways, intentional or not, for better or worse.
---
LF Horde / PvP / CST or EST / Semi-Hardcore PvE / PvP Ranking (SKERAM)
---
I am a Vanilla Vet that is extremely pumped to be back in the game that I loved for so long.
---
I had 300+ days played on Rogue in Vanilla before TBC released.
---
I played up until early WOTLK then quit because I did not like the direction the game was taking.
---
I cleared all content up to the first wing of Naxx except C'thun.
---
I enjoy PVP very much - Hit rank 11 in Vanilla and was a 2700+ arena player until I quit in WOTLK. (can link Achievement)
---
I am playing Rogue again and will use mining/engineering.
---
I am 31 years old and have a rotating schedule (oilfield). unfortunately this means that I will not be able to make every single raid, but I will try my absolute best to do so. The good side is that I have a lot of free time to invest into my character and help out the guild. I typically work 5 days on week 1 &amp; 2 days on week 2. this alternates, so some weeks depending on how it falls I could make all functions.
---
This is what I'm looking for:
---
Raid times between the 6-9:30pm CST (range), running no longer than 3 or 3 1/2 hours nightly and no more than 3 nights a week at most.
---
Mostly an adult atmosphere.
---
Somewhat "established". Thus far it should be evident I'm looking for some structure. So please, have a core or structure in place if interested in me. I'm not interested in joining 5 people with an idea.
---
Has intentions of entering MC at least 2 months after release.
---
\*Also-Considering the nature of my work schedule I would consider taking a bench spot or joining a guild with goals of quickly getting a very competent raid team 2 going.
---
\*Please DM me here, or on Discord with your guild details. Discord is Manus#8021
---
I mean that’s a pretty generic generalization most people make when they’re on a post talking about things they’re passionate about.
---
Nah bro, three servers was all they needed. Disregard the mad rush to add 20+ servers right before launch. 3 was plenty.
---
What a meltdown. At least you didn't delete...
---
My healer is my room mate so I just life tap myself into oblivion and scream "Heal me, bitch!"
---
Sometimes he does; sometimes he doesn't.
---
Been tanking as arms and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s better then arms sub 40 because I have improved charge and Tac mastery, so I can actually charge and swap stances while having rage.  It’s not like the mobs hit crazy hard at least where I’m at.
---
The vast majority of people have no idea even at a base level how a DDoS attack works. It is not at all common information.  It's easy to fall into that assumption if you're just surrounded by technically minded people and such, but the vast majority of gamers don't even understand the difference between their ISP and the servers their game is hosted on, much less how a denial of service attack works.  I'd say most people's knowledge stops at "someone sends a ton of traffic to the point where the target can't handle it anymore", and that's probably giving too much credit.

This is the classic experience as a tank, you wanted this.

how much are charms selling for on your server?

Really? maybe you can tell me where haha, so much trouble getting tanks for dungeons!
---
Yeah I'm gonna swap to fury for raiding but everyone levels up arms
---
Oh yuck. Fug that. I like dominos for my bars and more customization for unit frames.
---
Classic is the only reason I ressubed after 1 year, since BFA (not retail in general) doesn't appeal to me at all. I expect that in a few weeks I will start spending less time in Classic (not stop playing entirely) and mix it with other games/activities.
---
Not a chance, haven't been this into a game in a long time. Plan on staying for a while and cant wait for battlegrounds to come out
---
fuck yeah I'll go somewhere else for 100g!! i wouldnt even think twice

---

---
Thanks! So forget about battle stance and thunder clapping and stance dancing? Guess it’s not worth it in the non-max level dungeons.
---
I think that actually captures the currently active window.  For something like full screen wow, it's effectively the same, but just FYI if you needed it for other applications.
---
I want white pets so, as Alliance I waited near this quest for about 30 minutes with a pet named LetMeTameEch, no one obliged but luckily some lone Orc called him, got mauled by him which allowed me to tame him.

---
Didn’t blizz just say the other day you won’t get a full list of who is online even for your own faction in response to all the people claiming to have made layer swapping addons that are based on people scans?
---
Playing on Myzrael[PVE], I have seen 'layers' mentioned a handful of times in one of the global chats, and usually it was just folks asking what it was. However, I havent had a queue since a few days in, so maybe it is only an issue for higher pop servers. We only clock in at High pop. during peak times.
---
That being said, it does not directly effect my gameplay and I have yet to see something replicable and verifiable. 
---
Starts to feel like tinfoil hat style conspiracy theory if you don't experience it directly.
---
I tend to believe Blizzard' statement on it because they haven't had any real hesitance in issuing bans before. I would imagine more folks bragging about their gains if it was widespread but all see it secondhand accounts and accusations with no backing.
---
You sound like the kind of person I want in my party!
---
Don't worry about it. You really shouldn't use your staff. it's gonna hit like a wet noodle. Get a wand and wand everything instead.
---
Until you have to grind SW MGT:hc 50 times for the melee trinket.
---
imagine trying to convince yourself it's funny by spamming emotes on the internet.
---
and you're still wrong. tell me how you really feel. kek
---
So you're telling me I'm. Not seeing what I'm seeing? Just because YOU don't see it doesn't mean no one else does.
---
Literally on my server, lfg and trade chat are spammed with ppl asking to change layers and it's annoying as hell. It's not 24/7 but it's enough that if you watch chat for a awhile you'll see it pop up quite a bit. There's people in my guild who will ask to switch layers like idk what to tell you... This is happening
---

Check out Details! Newest update. It has Tony Threat built into it. Hover over the gear icon in the dps meter window, create new window, hover over gear icon in that new window, raid, tiny threat
---
I put up with it. Healing a 2h tank isn’t hard. Also makes the instance go much quicker.
---
I like that idea but I also prefer the os7 model. I think maybe separating it by realm would be more efficient. Updating the client to have multiple launch options for classic, classic BC, and classic 'continued' that would be a constantly updating game. Over all I think blizzard would make more money and keep more players by adding new content to classic not releasing old contend. As much as I want to play BC I'd rather have a brand new expansion that doesn't have the quest addons for it and all of wow head readily available. A completely new experience should be preferred over a revival of an old experience. It might be an unpopular opinion but that's how I personally feel about the game.
---
Well fuck..
---
Yeah, I've already re-rolled on the same realm 3 times now.
---
Got Priest to level 11, didn't like name.
---
Got another Priest to level 22, not really fun to solo grind.

Got a Rogue to level 12, thinking I should just go to a PVP realm.

lmao thats awesome.

That's ridiculous. Any warrior spec can tank any 5 man dungeon (at their level) by just putting a shield on.

---
Private servers audience was a small close community of hardcore gamers willing to play on temporary illegal servers. The objective of these servers was to keep that small specific population happy.
---
The objective of classic is to get as many people playing as possible, hardcore and casual, and keep them playing for as long as possible. Blizzard is beholden to shareholders and must do what is best for the profits, and that is a classic experience which is easier on casuals.
---
You can keep justifying your cheating ways, but it is still cheating. You get your epic mount, consumables, gear and gold for alts, etc etc. It’s always the people who are busy with work who try to rationalize buying gold, and say it’s not cheating, just making things “fair”. Well, blizzard considers it cheating, so it’s cheating.
---
Either make your friends help you, wait until you're higher level, or buy the charms off the AH.

---
Dang! Grouping is the fun part, too. I hope you guys can eventually run a dungeon and crack some jokes on Discord together.
---
In classic wow, you're not really supposed to stay in one zone start to finish. Especially in the 10 to 20 range you might visit three different zones, doing a few quests in each one.
---
I like to think that when they don't drop the item you're looking for, you must have accidentally damaged it during battle so it's not salvageable. Only thing that keeps me sane while grinding murloc heads.
---
While shadow wands benefit from Shadow Weaving, they do not inflict Shadow Weaving, correct?
---
waiting for my intervention like...
---
So you were filling a lack of supply.  Now there is sufficient supply.  The market has corrected.  it is no longer a 50s item.
---
Dragons scared everything away ;)
---
Also consider grouping up for tougher quests.
---
How about playing both if you like both? Forced communities and memes are both bad.
---
He obviously will. This guy will eventually react to every video on youtube connected in any way with wow

Server faction?

It's their fault for losing out on money like that, because they either tune it wrong or don't want to. If I need 1 of an item, I may buy it. But in this case, leveling up my cooking I spent the extra money and bought a stack of it for like 50c more. Was worth the extra clicking.
---
Female trolls are so regal looking. Love them!!
---
OH NO
---
&gt; Idgaf whether it's better for another person if it's an improvement over what I have
---
That's a great attitude to have if you never want to get past bwl
---
Because you have this basic assumption that we owe you water. The tank tanks and the healer heals and the dps dps because that’s what we need to do to finish the dungeon. Me making you water isn’t vital to doing the dungeon, it’s so you don’t have to spend coin buying your own. It’s annoying to have to constantly make water for every group you join.
---
Yeah I  know it sucks from the other side as well.
---
If I find good tanks, heals or dps I put them on my friends list and always start with them to see if their interested in the next dungeon I do.
---
you really want blizzard to stop what they're doing and focus on giving you 45 cents?
---
Play what you want, don't force yourself to play a race/class combo you don't like. I am a Herod refugee currently residing on Incendius where I had to re-roll. I went from Dwarf priest to Night Elf priest and I am happy I did. I was tired of being short af. Sure, fear ward is great, but I don't care because I actually like what I play now.
---
I know what cloak you're talking about and simply put, it isn't worth 50s anymore because the supply of the raw materials has plumetted and there are hundreds of Crafters who can make that item now. I was making and selling them for 1g each on day 3 because I was one of the first with the ability to do so, but now that the supply is through the roof because tons of people can do it and the mats are cheap.
---
Hidden lore, the player characters are psychic.
---
Yep, it's perfectly normal to quest in multiple areas, going back and forth based on what quests are available. Until the super high levels, there will always be more zones with appropriately leveled quests.
---
Winning comment right here. Could also freeze trap or charm her. :)
---
Oh I thought people were trolling putting everything up one by one but it's actually by an addon? pftt

Good eye! You're the first to spot it, lol.

I'm sorry, what the fuck is this dude listening to?
---
How's it forcing you,  I'm stumped..
---
Thx a lot ! Most appreciated
---
&gt; power leveling
---
Until the late stages of the classic beta, power leveling was questing in the world, with the exception of aoe blizzard and hunters using auto shot against higher level mobs.  It just sucks that in PVP servers, players do not have to experience the world to get to level 60 and can pretty much play unhindered with the exception of one GY run to the instance when they do not own the dungeon portal entrance.
---
Just get level 40 and get both ez
---
Why report him? Just move on. Nothing says you can’t shit talk.
---
Ha! I just got it to :) buyer @ gehennas - pm me.

I have such a good pc at work and a crappie one in my home. I rly want to switch
---
But in classic+ they are adding pet battles so you can use it then!

---
Standard "Blizzard Polish" ?
---
Funny, but also breaks any semblance of immersion, which I guess is also Blizzard style.
---
Brought in a friend who's a first time wow player and has gotten hooked etc and at one point during our first dungeon that a hunter was in he just says "holy shit... is this why I've heard the term huntard?"
---
Bind on Equip.
---
In WoW, uncommon and rarer equipment is 'bound' to a player, meaning only that player can equip it; it can not be traded to another player, or sold on the AH. It's a system to keep the game economy from being flooded with the most powerful equipment.
---
The 'weaker' of these items are bind on equip; if you equip the item, it is bound to you. You can trade it, give it to an alt, sell it on the AH, even vendor it, or you can equip it to yourself.
---
The strongest of the rare items are bind on pickup--if loot it, it's bound to you. This means that for the most powerful gear, it is THAT character that earned it; you can't take it and sell it on the auction house or give it to an alt.
---
welcome to classic
---
&gt;DPS go ape shit when they see skulls.
---
Hey, you just gotta point us DPS in the right direction. Otherwise we're arcane explosion'ing rats in the corner. We need your guidance.
---
I'm more upset by seeing people put items up for less than what you'd get at the vendor...
---
There is also the NE zone - darkshore.  It is amazing from like, 12-22.
---
Real creative. You realize no one can type your name without seeing it in chat right? I means no one can type your name to invite you adf you to friends list or send you mail or invite to guild. Lol
---
Uh... hi boss?
---
My mate and me does aoe farm from time to time. So We went into arathi to kill those peons on the fields.
---
All good for around 20 min then a lvl 31 mage shows up and try to "steal" our spot. Well as lvl 31 it was kinda hard for him, so we made it a little bit harder for him. I wrote someting like  First come first serve!
---
And feared the group he had pulled, he died I wrote it again with a thanks.
---
He tried to fuck with us there for a couple more minutes, but he left shortly after.
---
I dont get it tbh. Sure you cant reserve the spot for you. But when you come there to aoe farm and see another mage already there, you just go fuck off into the distance and move on.  **First come first serve!** Its an unwritten rule. You came second you piss the fuck off!
---
Just ignore them and burn the boss. EZ.
---
wands don't use ranged attack power like guns and bows do, so increasing your agi only increases your chance to crit
---
I think you have to tell us the name now...
---
I was killing pirates to the left of the BB entrance when a warrior tried to kill me. I just ran to the guards and had them kill him.
---
I agree uberdanger is cool
---
Well in the case of scorpid scales, they apparently only worth what you can vendor them for unless the tough scorpid set takes off in popularity for some reason.  Generally crafting mats will be posted at near market price because they’re so liquid, and will usually be at AT LEAST break even on whatever their highest value recipe is.  
---
Scorpid scales don’t add value to recipes though.  All that thicc leather that goes in to them could be used in Nightscape Tunics instead and vendor for a higher price.  An AH addon isn’t going to tell you that.  Separating the garbage whites from ones with actual value is the hard bit that can get glossed over when 10 idiots keep posting stuff over and over because the others keep listing stuff near what only looks like a reasonable price.
---
you can't just say "no, don't do this" to people that abuse others, you can't change how people act in life and a post won't change how abusers act, they will only thrive off it...
---
 so, the solution? ignore. ignore the hate. maybe turn that into love if you don't want to ignore them.
---
Fucking amazing

---
Someone posted about this recently. They received a 24 hour suspension and were asked to rename it again.
---
You may be able to reach out to Blizzard and explain that you didn't understand the issue originally and they may flag the character to be renamed again without a suspension.
---
i did not know you could do this, thanks.
---
Not gonna lie almost all my friends went to retail from classic. At least I found a good guild of good people to play with at 60. I'm not quitting I'm having a great time.
---
As Alliance, my friend (Dwarf Warrior) and I (Human Paladin) went to Blackfathom Deeps and we met up with another alliance and a group of Horde. None of us attacked each other, we all just worked together to get through that maze-like entrance and get to the dungeon. It was a nice moment we all had.
---
That isn't true at all. It's almost identical just on a smaller scale. The same principles apply. 
---
The price is absolutely based on time.
---
This is important text. This quest confirms that your character is literally aware of what the player controlling it thinks - it smashes the implied barrier between the two
---
Thanks for the help guys! I guess ill move on to another area or go in a dungeon
---
Buy them all and then list them at a higher price then. Problem solved.
---
It depends honestly on if you're using your racials weapon specialization.
---
As an Orc I can do dungeons well below the requested level, people laugh at me till I'm in the group and pull more dps than them. 
---
And IMO heals is super variable because it depends on how well a healer can manage their mana and the groups health during / between pulls.
---
I'd say the tank needs to be the highest because obviously taunts being resisted leads to dead dps.
---
You have to macro it if you’re attaching it to an attack like OP is suggesting.
---
I dont know send a pic
---
congrats! You and him look awesome

if anybody can correct me, it drops off all the whelps in the area except lost whelp?

Reroll on pvp. It feels much better each level you get. 32 now with over 3 days played and loving the pvp battles while questing. Ganking to get that last hulking mountain lion or iron vein

That's what the post is for. To educate those that are.
---
I destroyed my hearthstone because it took up bag space and then decided to go on a water walking tour around kalimdor on my low levsl goblin shaman to see what all the different zones looked like.... I was bored 10 mins in.
---
The way the games combat system works, attacking higher level mobs puts you at a disadvantage while lower level mobs give you an advantage. 
---
Vs a higher level mob, your chance to hit and crit it is reduced. At the same time, it’s chance to hit, crit, and crushing blow you are also increased. 
---
Ca a lower level mob, your hit and crit chance are increased. It’s chance to hit, crit, or crushing blow you are also reduced. 
---
It is more efficient to kill equal or lower level mobs. 
---
So yes, swap quest hubs then come back later.
---
&gt; Fucking nerds

As opposed to the non-nerds playing classic wow?

Yeah but he has to tell the Magram leader that he's playing both sides, that way he always comes out on top.

MIND CONTROL

Bind on equip. Items bind and become untradable either after pick up or equip depending on the item. BOE's can be very expensive as they are powerful and tradable until equiped.
---
Dog shit tbc expansion?

Well sir take my down vote!
---
He's saying evasion gets you killed versus warriors, cause overpower.
---
As someone who doesn't want to bother people, I just buy water because mage's aren't your vending machines

It will save you gold to at least look at a guide and get an idea of what's good. I love respeccing and trying out new builds, but it gets to be an expensive hobby.
---
Ha no! Its Anustart - and my pets name is tobias.
---
Ok, it's happening.  Some people are swtiching layers.  Now what?  What's the big issue?  Show evidence.  Screencaps.  Something.  Anything.  Show us what a huge, gamebreaking issue this is.
---
So at 15 you can level in Redridge, westfall, or aubordine(darkshore I think) areas for alliance. I think for horde you can go barrens...
---
how do you know that ?
---
South Park had a saying "how can you kill that which has no life?"

---
Or just download the addon. I play very addon-light but Auctioneer is just mandatory to have an actual functioning auction house.
---
Oh god no, it's the reason why they had to enable server transfers for the queued up realms. 
---
They grossly underestimated how big classic is and would be again, and thought they'd be fine.
---
Now on a lot of those queued servers, one of which I am on, I am really unsure about their promise to get rid of layering before phase 2.
---

---
Yep - there's definitely some nostalgia goggles stuff going on, and IMO early Cata was actually my favorite time playing WoW, but this is the first time I've actually had fun playing an MMO in over 6 years.
---
Before this I'd basically sworn off MMOs for good. Modern MMO design basically feels like a single player game with multiplayer stuff tacked on now, instead of an actual persistent populated world.
---
I think the ones that bother me are after a clear, you top them off / renew. Then start drinking for the next pull and the lock taps to 20% hp going into the next pull without eating or bandaging. This happens quiet often. The worst is when you are in a group with no mage. Spending 40s for 5x stack of end game water from vendors.
---
Puts the healer in a bind: do I use 1/3 of my mana to heal the lock again or worry about making sure I won't go oom keeping the tank up?
---
He’s probably got a higher camera distance setting.
---
Go to settings &gt; interface &gt; camera or something, and you can open it up.
---
OP here.  Thanks to all who answered my question.  You have all the same opinion than me and I think it's the normal rule
---
Why is layering bad?
---
Funny thing is the people who decide to stick through tanking are forged into hardier thick skinned people that don't take a lot of bs from the assholes.
---
A stack was around 5-7g
---
If you have a pet that taunts, turn auto casting for it off by right clicking on it in the pet bar. Golden outline trail means it is automatically casting. 
---
Set your pet up on Passive or Defensive and send it in manually. Be careful of the path your pet is taking to attack the mob. 
---
Generally, try to let your tank build some threat before you attack, and always try to attack the enemy your tank is attacking unless told otherwise for specific pulls and strategies. If it's a Warrior, wait on a Rend or Sunder debuff to pop up on the mob, or Thunder Clap or a shout.
---
If you notice a target is aggressive and not taking damage, trap it or sleep it to help your healer when you get those abilities.
---
Try to avoid damaging targets that are already CC'd. If you break the CC, try to Feign Death or Distracting Shot to dump aggro, or even reapply a CC of your own.
---
Having joined in wrath myself I feel like its only a benefit to me. I don't really have any nostalgia from vanilla but I'm still familiar with the talent trees and other aspects such as certain spells needing reagents. 
---
So I get to experience everything as if it is brand new but I am also already familiar with many of the mechanics/abilities that  were pruned in cata and beyond.
---
So... I just took my first stroll through there at lvl 20 horde. I didn't see much in terms of ganking other than a call for help by some yeti cave.
---
I'm brand ass spanking new to the game. Isn't there supposed to be some sort of war going on against horde and alliance players? I've been seeing alliance players at rachet, brill by death knell, and the regions near the barrens.   I see then pass by me and I think I'm about to get into a fight but nope. Other horde players let them stroll through. So I don't know if im supposed to do the same or what am I doing in this game?
---
In addition to freeze traps, not auto growl, and dismissing before jumps I would add keep your pet on passive and either hot key pet attack or macro it into an ability that will only send your pet to fight a target you are actively shooting.   Yes your pet will do a bit of running which will cut into your dps but better than your pet messing up a pull and wiping the group.
---
To not put all their eggs in one basket; to please multiple types of players not just one. At the most minimal cost to them. Maybe this is something all businesses do anyway (or try to do). :P
---
Classic encourages team play through its difficulties. Classes have strengths and weaknesses that cannot be solved alone. 
---
Retail conceded this and made every class a watered down version of every other class with a solution to allow anyone to solo anything. No team play. 
---
I don’t think there is a way to backtrack on that design at this point. 
---
Also, the gear treadmill in classic cannot be bypassed. You put in work, or you sit in blues.
---
"I fucking hate when a Warlock makes me use my mana to increase his DPS, like fuck man what do i look like a fucking healer"
---
Except for the parts hes wrong about i guess sure
---
Can't you pay to keep getting updates?
---
Stats provide different bonuses in different amounts to different classes.
---
I.e. Agility only gives melee attack power to rogues and it gives them 30% less dodge per point than it does to Warriors and Shamans.
---
Spirit is where the biggest differences happen, since Warriors get 80% of their spirit as HP every 2 seconds, rogues get 50% of their spirit as HP,  and others range from between 7% to 25%
---
So 100 spirit would give Warriors 400 HP over 10 seconds but only 35 to a warlock in the same time period.
---
Give people a reason to act within a community, and nothing else matters.
---
I basically only report morons in barrens chat purely for language cause it just gets vile as fuck lol. I will 100% drop a report on someone who's being a dickhead then drops some dumb shit in say chat though.
---
Correct the title to say "bag" not "back." I spend like 5 seconds trying to find your character log mousing over a back item. I want my 5 seconds back.
---
I actually dont mind the grind and walking. It helps make with a sense of meaningful progression and makes the world appear truly massive.
---
You nailed it. We’ve successfully mastered the meme.
---
I usually pretend to walk along so they think im busy but once they are about to loot i run back and wait for the free skin
---
I would have started to hit nodes 2-3 times and then leave some shitty item like Coarse Stone on the node. It shouldn't despawn, or respawn, while it still has loot on it so that sucker will run up, min the node, get 1 Coarse Stone or whatever and then the node disappears.
---
We used to do this all the time with mining in WotLK and Cata when we knew there were a lot of people botting the area.
---
&gt;I've been trying to tank dungeons the right way
---
That isn't the right way, that is the arbitrarily slow way.
---
I've updated the chart to hopefully help it make more sense for other roles. The "minimum level" is based entirely off of the final boss level, and on the old chart only the recommendation for tank was shown. DPS and heals can get away with less, but even in SM GY you're going to have a smoother experience if your tank can actually hit the last boss!
---
True for pretty much all levels IIRC, haven't gotten to 40+ again to confirm what I remember. Obviously you will be better off if you work in quests that overlap with grinding. 
---
If you want, I'll link you to the 'xp/hour' addon that I use which helps you get perspective &amp; compare your incoming xp.
---
Just yesterday I saw a priest I had run into the day before, was such a wierd moment seeing him be the same level as me at a different zone. Really just drove home, like "wow, we are playing on the same server and are gaming together".
---
Nvm I fix it.

It's a bit cliche, but when you hit level 60, you're gonna be setting your goals. Some things that come to mind are: finish every raid, get every BiS and have some fun in PvP.

I wish we had "Achievements" in Classic, but you can also set your own!

You don't know how the other faction on that same server plays though. Whereas if you ever want to come back to the gnome warlock, you do know Alliance on that server is solid, and you'll still have your gnome. :)

I've never quested in Loch Modan in the 15 years I've played WoW off and on, what does it have going for it?

Level 29 Priest currently, still eager to log in. This game feels like a real adventure. Also, everyone from work is playing because of me and they can't stop.

I am excited to go home, finish up ashenvale/hillsbrad quests, and continue to thousand needles. None of the 'complaints' about lack of quality of life have affected me in the slightest, and I am having the most fun I have ever had with an MMO since OSRS released in 2013.

It will actually depend on how powerful you and the other members of your party are so we actually cannot answer this for you
---
just did ZF last night 2 warriors, 1 enh shaman, 1 combat rogue with our healing shaman being some sort of leveling hybrid
---
whatever cleave works perfectly fine until very late game if your group knows what they're doing
---
In case you need to know where the blue, red, yellow raptor nests are. The quest text sure doesn't help out much
---
&gt;Attack whatever target the tank is attacking
---
I keep seeing people say this how does that even make sense? When I tank I go around sundering everyone and ill attack anyone whos not aggroed on me. Why would the dps attack who im attacking?
---
oh I must have misread. I thought you sheeped the alliance player to intentionally heal/save him. Thanks for not grilling me due to me just misunderstanding what you typed. Sounds like you did everything right here (and fk that asshole horde player)
---
Youre telling me to get more pvp on a low pop instead of the high pop i deliberately chose for said reason. Perfect logic. Its chill.. instead of wasting my time talking to a retail baby i can just wait a few more weeks till they get rid of this garbage layering. Hope youll be able to handle the pvp
---
He found it boys, classic's ruined and cancelled!
---
&gt;they're used to rolling through dungeons in full heirlooms with like at least one person afk at all times and the healer using more damaging spells than healing.
---
This is how much dungeons happen now in classic because classic is easy and people are generally better.
---
A tank here, just wanted to say that I love you guys. Keep up the good work :)
---
What is it like to level a solo build (shadow build on icy veins) and still heal early on? I am curious if I could still be find healing through SFK, even though I am going a more dps build
---
To that end, are people leveling as holy to mainly focus on heals in groups but still solo questing? I am having trouble finding good info on this
---
You beautiful bastard
---
You may be the only one ;)
---
Yeah stopped playing wow after tbc. Looked into coming back later but they butchered the game by making it far too easy. Raids, dungeons, skills, leveling, there just isn't any difficulty to it. Not paying 15 a month to autopilot my way to bis.
---
&gt;Then I’ve pretty much used up the available real estate around the wasd keys
---
Can you elaborate? You've used up Q E R T F G Z X C V, and shift+all those letters?
---
How about mousewheel and mouse buttons?
---
I don't think it is bad. But if you look around this sub, especially a couple days ago you will see people acting like layering killed classic already.
---
No one really wanted layering, blizzard included. It was just implemented for launch to deal with crowds, and will be removed by phase 2.
---
I mean, Mechagon is fun and Eternal Palace is good. But other than that, the content dries up fast. This expansion lacks the progress Suramar and Class Halls provided so there's nothing to really do besides AP grinds.
---
&gt; but even in SM GY you're going to have a smoother experience if your tank can actually hit the last boss!
---
Thats **IF** your group is even doing the last boss, lmao.
---
God yes, completely addicted to skinning
---
Because by not already buying said item he's already shown the money is worth more to him than the item and as such he would not equip the item.
---
The environmental detail is amazing, the grasses actually part when you walk through them.  I always cringe when I see screenshots where the flat ground is just one color with no sense of dimension
---
I fail to see how this is relevant or funny.
---
for 8 charms?
---
Yes, there will be a warning before equipping a BOE item, and also a warning before looting a BOP item.
---
Yeah I was originally going to do that but I chose alchemy because I wanted to provide early potions to my friends while we play. And end game I’m going to try be the go to guy for potions in a guild or something.
---
It was actually driving me kind of crazy because I feel like that screenshot is a SUPER old screenshot from old private servers but I couldn't find it anywhere when I was looking.  I remember seeing a screenshot way back in the day of a bank and bags full of arcane crystals.
---
Blizzard has absolutely no control over the feel of the community. Feelings or community. That is 100% in the control and the choice of the players.
---
wowhead has some great classic wow dungeon guides (usually titled "Tips for XX Dungeon") that will break down each encounter, and tell you what roles need to look out for what.
---
As a DPS, your role is pretty simple: DPS things. But you have to keep threat mechanics in mind. Tanks need time to build a bit of aggro, and generally what you need to do as DPS is focus on each mob until they die. The order that you kill mobs is important in some situations, others you just want to make sure you're focusing on the right ones so you don't pull aggro. If you do pull it, use feign death to drop aggro. The tank holding the threat is the important part.
---
Another tip is to dismiss your pet before you jump off a ledge. Sometimes the pet will teleport to you if you don't, but sometimes the pet will take the long way down and aggro every mob it comes across, bringing them all to you. 
---
Like someone else said, if you've never done a dungeon before, communicate that. Most groups are pretty great about letting you know what to do. The ones that aren't are very easily replaceable.
---
How? Stop being so fucking anal about threat. Taunt any big threats you can and just let dps make your dungeon faster.
---
The only reason I'm here personally is the lack of a guaranteed invalidation of all my accomplishments in two years.
---
The moment Blizzard announces BC, or a raised level cap, or any classic+ content that invalidates the current reward progression or otherwise allows players to skip content that I worked hard to beat, yeah I'm gone. No offense to the people that would like to see classic expanded on, but that's just not my jam.
---
Shield Block and Demoralizing Shout can also help your healer out.
---
I ran a census adding on the RP server last night. 19,633 alliance found. 754 horse. 
---
20,000 people in 24 hours. Wow. I took the census 4 times over Sunday. I’m going to continue doing it at random times all week.
---
Not sure if troll or not
---
&gt; 1 I mained a paladin from vanilla till wrath, never once did using a pot concern me.
---
This is just a stupid statement. Holy Pallies are notorious in Vanilla for not running out of mana due to their crit heal talent.
---
Oh hey look, a neckbeard decided to enlighten us.
---
https://twitter.com/nostalbegins/status/719297777868546048
---
I would say it surpassed a "small niche community", and just appealed to general wow players who were fed up with how the game changed. Millions of people tuned into the "illegal servers" for an abandonware.
---
&gt;The objective of classic is to get as many people playing as possible, hardcore and casual, and keep them playing for as long as possible.
---
Yes, I agree. I just think they could have looked more at the experience from private servers who has been doing for years and learned from them.
---
And again, I believe it appeals to the exact same audience.
---
&gt;Blizzard is beholden to shareholders and must do what is best for the profits, and that is a classic experience which is easier on casuals.
---
There is a balance between hardcore and casual, and finding the middle road isn't easy.  The game is fine with 1.12.1 but I would have prefered a slight nerf to all the classes with 1.7 itemization just to keep the early max-level content slightly more difficult to increase its longevity (obviously the truly hardcore would still clear it immediately).
---
Which is why I say to tell them not to run from you if they do it a couple of times. But if they refuse to listen; let them die.
---
It's the same mentality with DPS who won't get out of ground effects and assume the healers are going to spend all their mana on keeping 'just them' up.
---
This is a group-effort. If you don't contribute, the group fails.
---
Learning the ropes is one thing. Refusing to heed advice is another.
---
did you know that despite making up just 15% of the wow population, orcs commit 50% of lowbie ganks?

My guild has been abusing layering like mother fuckers farming up expensive mats and items and hording them until layerings gone...which a lot of people will so people say it won’t effect the economy but we all know damn well it will
---
I don't get it. That's where the nests are. Explain please!
---
Had that happen to me in desolace except it was alliance that ganked me and there were two of them, they jumped me on the last pack of mobs before the quest was over.
---
Honestly, the hard part is that most of us warriors don't have 1H weaps leveled up and it takes FOREVER (once you're in the mid 30s) to get it up to a reasonable level. That makes your rage generation so shitty. 
---
I've been tanking in defensive stance with my 2H weap. Great damage and threat and haven't run into any issues with staying alive. I will switch to battle stance for charge but switch back once I pull. 
---
With this method, I don't typically have shield block (meh) or shield bash, but I do use a weapon switch macro for the latter. I am able to get enough dodges and parries that revenge is used pretty regularly.

It’s not about the pendants, it’s about sending a message.

Stalagg PvP, Level 18 Mage. First time playing WoW.
---
Hello! I'm looking for anyone, alone or in group, interested in doing quests and dungeons or just chatting in general. Since it's my first time playing WoW, I have a lot to learn. I want to experience PvP and raids when the late game comes. I'm mostly online by the weekends because of IRL responsibilities. PM me if you are interested!
---
Wut
---
this is great
---
kinda the opposite tbh
---
shadow brings raid utility that isn't as important in 5 mans as CC is.
---
This doesn’t really show what’s bop and what’s boe or world drop or dungeon etc
---
Yeah but it gets me like 40s.
---
Get yourself a mouse with more buttons.  Loving my Razer Naga since it has 1-12 buttons under my thumb and then I can couple that with an alt or ctrl key combo and basically do 36 things with my two thumbs.
---
Never really did much with people outside of my guild in retail. I liked to think that all my characters were actually one guy with some weird mental disorder. Kind of like Reno Jackson in Hearthstone.
---
Lemme guess... Ibluemyself?
---
How were you able to get so much gold? I was there for 30 minutes and got 41 shellfish which was 4g. So in 3h I would roughly get 24g. Am I doing something wrong or just getting unlucky?
---
oh dear they best get you 70 cents
---
Lol thats great
---
Do they honestly not have rain in retail, wtf? What's the logic for that?
---
All lies (divorced with kids)
---
The big thing I’m seeing is just foot traffic.  People have a reason to be out in the world, and to team up while out there.  
---
The big unintended problem with phasing from WotLK on was that you could have 60 people in a zone but only 5 could see each other at any given time based on their quest progression.  When your single biggest interactions are 5-man tunnel runs and 25-man loot piñatas, you’ve got a problem.  
---
The biggest PvP battles I’ve seen in classic have been town raids and people just killing each other outside instances, stuff you don’t see any more because there is no reason to stand outside an instance portal.  
---
The world needs to be condensed and organic again, with tons of people shoved in to small areas with opportunities for them to team up, not increasingly separated by instanced/phased content.
---
Literally got camped for over an hour by Smerty and Gritch when Smerty ganked me on a pull and lost ensuing 1v1 so he called a friend to camp my corpse, they stayed for like 2 hours while I was working lol
---
I don't see the issue. So people will grind spots and reload the area. Who cares... It doesn't effect me at all. I guess the economy will be slightly affected but that only benefits people behind because things are slightly less gold. It hurts the people who are ahead who are selling... These are more likely to be the ones layering... If it is phased out, who cares.
---
Can mention Vanilla videos without mentioning[Pat](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok) or [Unbreakable](https://youtu.be/ja1j7xWpB3w)
---
This was a weird leak/rumor and never confirmed.  It makes a little sense Blizzard might do this, to try to pull classic players into retail.  It'd be the only way I'm getting BfA.
---
You’re a god damn liar! Nobody can kill Chester! Take it back
---
No?
---
I'm probably holding right mouse the entire time.. maybe that's why it's hidden idk.
---
I don't understand the amount of people not looting corpses this early. You gotta shell out hella money for mount training and the mounts not to mention class training and other daily reagents. Every copper helps!
---
What means OCD?
---
I wouldn’t say it doesn’t matter. Right now, if you’re keeping up with the pace, it’s no problem to find groups for dungeons at your level. I don’t think anyone can say for sure how easy it will be in a month or two if you fall behind the pack. That said, I am still seeing plenty of people forming groups for VC and stocks
---
Authentic experience.
---
Ooohh what side door lol?  Reminds me about the time I found out about the SW/Iron Forge tram, 2 years later............
---
TBF, we've been saying this for many years. People were just like "No man, you just grew up and fell out of love with MMO's".
---
All the while I, a 31 year old man, was like "BITCH! Don't tell me, what I know is true! If I live. For 1000 years. Classic, would still cause me joyful tears.
---
I told you. I dont need to fly. Cause we have flight paths. Some of us dont know why. I was standing. You were there. 2 roads colliding. The chat will tear us apart.
---
I digress. I knew the MMO genre turned to shit, and I knew Classic would be awesome and pull me back in because it's an actual good MMO. Who would've figured I would enjoy the thing I've longed for? Rose tinted goggles are for remembering life achievements, not fun video games.
---
"Here Little Rogue.  Take this.  Remind our enemies that it is dangerous to go alone."

That's good, might steal that as those numbers are useless and marking doesn't need fast reach keys

---
Theres a bridge that comes out the side of org and takes you basically right to it.
---
I agree. That's what I am loving about wow classic. Everyone helping each other out. Great community so far. I even revived someone yesterday after they died, couldn't get there in time to save them.
---
"What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game..."
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg2PD-dwsIw
---
Totally agree, feels great in both directions. This is my first time playing vanilla/classic, since I didn’t start until a few weeks before cata dropped. It’s a totally different game and I love the whole community looking out for each other. This saving/being saved thing is one of the best moments.
---
Hm, I will have to check when I get home! Think I may have more but this if my first run through so I have no clue what I am doing half the time.
---
This is so fucked up and insensitive, I love it
---
Yeah I see that now. Makes a lot more sense when you put it that way.
---
Rogue here, I just want the farming aoe mages to stop skinning, go disenchanted like a normal magician.
---
booo.  blizz games are defined by art style. this looks like any number of generic "wow killer" games from 2010 on up. a lot of ppl play wow because of it's style, not in spite of it.
---
&lt;Indecisive&gt;
---
Well that was a lie.
---
Yes the more I thought about it after the other persons post the more it made sense they did it the way they did.
---
I'd still like to be able to swap this bag out or at the very least be able to pay to upgrade it. Also bugged me it was stuck at 16 slots
---
You seriously need to turn on dark mode; I hope you don’t look at reddit in bed on that phone!!
---
Sometimes my totems buff aren't applied to some of my party members, is this a bug or is there a reason why? (And yes they're in range)
---
A business model that has already proven wildly successful is the most likely thing shareholders will go for. The #nOcHaNgEs crowd is laughable.
---
Oh trust me, it will only accentuate it.
---
You already established your a neckbeard, move on. I'm sure your sharp wit is needed elsewhere.
---
Are you using shadow and light for the character panel?
---
Yeeeaaaah things like Dungeon Finder completely ruin the experience. I love that they have not put any QoL things in.
---
You can also do WC. It\`s far away in the middle of horde-land, but a very cool dungeon.
---
doesnt fuck with mine. Good screen good, bad screen bad.
---
That also sucks, but I think it sucks less than being forced to run the same raid over and over again for as long as you play the game.
---
Some say Chestnutz is still charging to this day...
---
Apologies if you're just memeing, but this was an event in the Wrath expansion.  It was an instanced event you queued for and fought through which ended with the events 8-brit mentioned.  
---
Here's a timestamped vod of someone doing it https://youtu.be/thvM9fd-pJA?t=464
---
I'd rather they launched TBC and then allowed a **one time** character copy of one of your characters to a TBC Server. The restrictions would be: No more than 10 gold, No inventory, No bank, No Guild (thus no guild bank); just the clothing on your back. Also, the copy is limited to one per account (Bnet account).
---
Remember: Even in TBC, the 1-58 grind was still just as tough as Vanilla's. So, I could see a lot of players being deterred at the prospect of needing to 'start over' with each Legacy Expansion release.
---
This way every player can play any of the expansions they like, while still preserving the feel.  - Imagine when Achievements come out and they have lose the AQ Staff achievement because the quest chain was broken in Cata. Or losing "Hand of A'dal" title in....Mist? ((Think that's when the chain was locked out.))
---
...and...omg, those with Scarab Lord losing the mount and title in TBC+ because of a "fresh start" for each expansion.
---
((And no, this isn't going to splinter the community. Some of us don't want to play beyond Vanilla. Other's won't want to go past TBC or Wrath. If the 'Legacy Servers' do, those players will, once again, quit. - The community will still splinter, as swathes leave.))
---
Really shitty. This is Classic, and your reputation will follow you on your server. Good luck with that.
---
Lmao. Then why did you try to justify your point by mentioning their being above 75% mana? Cmon man connect the dots
---

---
shit like this makes me glad im on bloodsail, just about every single person ive met is chill
---
I do this at every opportunity on my Priest. Great feeling when they're shocked to be alive.
---
It really depends, I had a 29 rogue with almost 3000 hp and I could wade through a sea of non-twinked characters because they had maybe 1/3 of my health if they were lucky. Add in consumables and it’s like that giant pillow man gif where he’s just steamrolling little kids. Sometimes you just get got.
---
Well human warriors have racial for mace and sword, and usually either go axe spec or sword spec while leveling, necessitating a respec that they prob dont want if its not a big enough upgrade
---
I can assure you that majority of playerbase is way below level 20.
---
I know this feeling.. As a paladin it feels good to drop a heal on a stranger that was about to die. One time a horde was gunna die, and I killed the mob to save him. Next thing you know he attacks me after getting full health! So i smacked him all the way to the grave.
---
The obvious answer is dagger+firestone.
---
Slam is viable way to play in raid.
---
No mention of sunder armor useage and for the majority of leveling it should be used right after rend or first at later levels.
---
Sticking to battle  always is a mistake. 3% crit is great.
---
&gt;lol wut. Resilience was generally very good, going into WSG and getting steamrolled by the tier 3 mage because PvE gear is better in PvP than PvP gear was just bad design.
---
Absofuckinglutely not.  Resilience was pure garbage.  It made the game feel extremely linear as well as made people not want to complete raid content.  Rewarding PvE achievements in having advantages in PvP is literally the entire point of the game.  Imagine thinking you shouldn't be rewarded in all aspects of the game for completing the most challenging content.  I think you have rose-tinted glasses on.
---
&gt;\&gt; "Bad" balance changes? TBC was almost universally praised for having better balance than vanilla, which had 2 classes that were so much better than the rest and hybrids are mostly worthless. You're extremely biased here.
---
Yep, you misunderstood what I was saying.  While TBC had "better balance" than vanilla, it eventually went haywire because of "MUH ESPORT BALANCE".   It's a phenomenon that happens in almost every game that tries too hard to become a competitive game.  The game becomes extremely scrutinized and eventually destroyed.  Resilience is actually an example of this.  They didn't want the best PvP gear to be from PvE, but that's how it should be in a RPG based on an entire world of content and not just a small concentrated PvP arena.
---
&gt;\&gt; They also tried it with Hellfire Penninsula, Zangarmarsh and Halaa in Nagrand...
---
Like I said, their implementations were bad and unimaginative.  Also, you don't seem to realize that having concentrated, casual, queuable PvP, is always going to be the most popular option and will take away from any other PvP-oriented additions.  Things that are easy to access and offer great rewards will ALWAYS be the most popular thing.  So it's no wonder that BG/Arenas are popular.  We never got to see the opposite spectrum of what could be possible, aka more world pvp events/additions/mechanics and less instanced PvP.
---
Huh, I was under the impression that Spirit only affected mana regeneration outside of combat, and that the 5SR merely applied to some "base" rate.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I played on Delta's GogoInternet this past weekend too.. the ping is high but it works!
---
Based on how the tweet read it looks like they were using Wikipedia as a way to test the DDoS before moving onto something that would really get them attention.
---
What’s worse are the fools that loot a chest and leave that one useless item in it so it doesn’t respawn and I find it of course....
---
The RP is strong in this!
---
nice
---
He’s not god of anything he’s a silly man-child literally sitting in a basement.  Which would be fine since it’s wow but he’s also been exposed as a hypocrite
---
Unless you're a meme hunter.
---
How much were you selling the combo?
---
Yeah the amount of warriors just looking to dps is ridiculous. When I played vanilla I mained a warrior as an arms spec warrior and tanked almost every dungeon.
---
Then I focused on PVP but would occasionally respec prot to join some raids.
---
I've run into issues where the zip folder actually contains sub-folders for multiple addons. For example, I think WeakAuras is actually a collection of various addons that all need to be in the top level "Addon" folder.
---
Cool guys thanks.
---
Also, was the lock box room on the ship near Rachet completely overrun with other rogues trying to level lockpicking?  How are the box spawn rates?  Thanks all.
---
That scallywagging OP!
---
Necromancer Leggings can carry a warlock or shadow priest right up to 60. They're insane for their level.
---
2 characters are not enough of you play every day.
---
Glad you told me this. I was really lost for the first 30 pages and what you said sounds like my experience. Giving it another shot !
---
Some people play rogue because they are really good DPS in PvE.  Not me, I'm an asshole rogue who ganks everyone but some people are different.
---
By this logic a mage should make you water and afk while you clear the dungeon for him since that’s his role to play.
---
Posting on reddit first is definitely faster.
---
mine does the same with chrome remote lol. I pretty much only remote in to get in queue or test addons because of it.
---
Wish I could be one, be nice not having to shave for once. If only....
---
US Faerlina but sounds like y’all Alliance boys get trapped in that yeti cave a lot across all servers 😂
---
I have similar question. I am leveling with arms (lvl 30 only) and tank in dungeon. Sometimes I have trouble maintaining multiple mob agro. I start with Charge if possible then switch to defense stance. 
---
Tanking boss is no issue as long as I pop Shield Block to reduce damage. It's messy when I have to tank multiple mobs. I use sunder and revenge on single target and demoralizing shout when facing multiple targets.
---
Anything I can improve? Should I use fast single hand weapon or slow?
---
Does it matter? It's obviously pulled out of my ass, but blizzard could permanently fuck linux users without even a blip in their revenue. So again I say who cares, get windows
---
&gt;I'm more upset by seeing people put items up for **less than what you'd get at the vendor...**
---
Irrelevant example about and item listed for **more** than the vendor price.
---
&gt; A lesser moonstone will vendor for 6 silver. It's listed at 6s84c for "very long". It costs something like 1s24c to list an auction for lesser moonstone for 24 hours. 
---
That's a seller problem, got nothing to do with me, or my response.
---
Dont dump into heroic strikes. Use sunder/rend overpower. HS is a huge waste of rage.
---
Why do I get the feeling that the joke that started this was an instance of Schroedinger's Douchebag? 
---
Guild Masters are generally in the position of having to mediate between members, and sometimes something can bother someone but not others. The GM might've been caught between what they thought was funny personally and what they were asked to do in their position as a GM.
---
Alternatively, they were a power-mad dictator, as mentioned.
---
I do, however, find that genuinely funny jokes don't tend to get reactions like this. But I'm American so that may be coloring everything.
---

---
Dnd stories always make me wish I didn’t work 80+ a week and had friends you all are great!
---
... Huh. I thought you needed a macro for this.
---
Learn something new everyday.
---
I don't get it either. Its not like they abused this to get some permanent real estate they can milk passive money from. They collected some extra consumable mats. They get a small boost in the short term, which they would get anyway from being ahead of the pack. Who cares. People will be farming those same mats for months and months.
---
&gt;  They tried capturable fortresses in tbc i think.
---
It was basically capturable towers.  Not epic fortresses with anything I described.  It was poorly implemented trash.
---
Faction imbalance can be easily helped by "fortress buffs" for the weaker faction.
---
in your summary of the issue it seems that you believe I sit around in UC begging mages for water. I'm not referring to someone providing me a service ourside of their scope of game play. I'm asking a mage who is in the dungeon with me, striving for success, for water that has no reagent cost and likely has no time cost (there is plenty of waiting time leading up to or even in a dungeon).
---
im not stealing from pockets, I'm asking my party member to use their utility.
---
Damn man I feel your pain. I get like 2-3 hours a week to play. I do what I can but I wish I just had a full day to level
---
It's not the same at all. The whole problem with flying ia avoiding conflict and making all other forms of travel obsolete.  This does neither because a lack of speed makes other forms of travel superior and a fatigue timer means you can't avoid anyone who wants to chase you for longer than the timer which is short as fuck.
---
Say I'm being ganked in res mount on my ground mount and try to runaway, I can do that in classic it's fine.  I mount on my flying mount and try to fly away they easily follow on ground mounts and kill me.  If I fly up to somewhere they can't reach they can chase on flying mounts.  I can't avoid them I always have to land and I don't have the speed to get away.
---
oof, i feel bad for you....

---
I’m just a noob who came back for the re-release of Classic to be a noob again is all. I’m used to Destiny where a lot of the story is told outside of game or FFXIV where there’s legit cutscenes so that’s why I was asking. Thanks for the info! Sounds like WoW has a cool story but obviously in Classic so far I hadn’t seen any cutscenes or anything.
---
Yeah it's all preference
---
Even worse , they cost a bag slot!
---
Third! He’s done an In Depth talk with TipsOut on Warrior tanking, as well as a number of talks on tanking in general (Deftalk with Defcsmp ok YT as well). Very good resource. He also streams at twitch.tv/skarmtank very often and answers most questions that come up in chat.
---
The fuck are you talking about? I'm not talking about selling an item and buying another.
---
I'm saying if you're willing to equip a boe you should go buy it off the auction house, if you don't do that, it's obviously because you're not willing to spend the money for said item. But if that item drops and you need on it and equip it, you're spending those money on the item, so all you're doing is needing on gold.
---
Man, y'all, why did you even roll on PvP servers if you aren't going to PvP?
---
Hey it's me a totally different person
---
You never played retail or what?
---
If your goal is speed dungeon is the way to go.  I am enjoying the quests so I have only run DM a couple times, Stocks twice and RFK once so far - and I am level 35.
---
Just picked up 15 quests or so from STV to work through and probably will do that rather than go grind SM over and over.
---
All about what you want your experience to be.
---
Makes sense to me.

I'm playing my first gnome now and so far escape artist has been very useful in scrappy world pvp situations.  It's like saying wotf isn't good against warlocks because fear is spammable.

Perception is also very underrated in this discussion.  It's pretty much "detect stealth" in classic.

Oh yea the charge, so awesome! Now i want to roll a warrior.

Sulfuras PVP Server &lt;Horde&gt;

 Hey there!  Level 25 Horde Druid here currently leveling at my own pace (profs, cooking, fishing, dungeons, reminiscing on my nostalgia from when I first played classic back in 2005,etc ) expecting to hit 60 sometimes in the next 30-45 days. I started in classic as a teen, raided somewhat in BC, raided heavily and hardcore in WotLK and then again heavily in MoP and WoD (missed some expansions). Looking for a friendly, tightknit guild to level with  and help each other that ultimately intends to do some semi-casual but still organized raiding end game with goals for progression along with a healthy focus in pvp. I will be resto at 60 for raiding and plan to try my hand at flag carrying and organized pvp both in BG and world. I missed the community aspect of classic/tbc the most and I'm really excited to dive back into it and hoping to find a guild to match my general interests that span a lot as mentioned.   I am an adult now with a job and unfortunately can't play as much as I could when I was a kid, but still log a few hours a day (with spans of more when work is slow) and can make raid times during the week evenings like 8-12 EST. My name is "Nicholas" in game (and in real life!) - shoot me a DM here or in game.. Thanks!
---
Bad is subjective - i found it relaxing, easier than Questing etc. 
---
But your numbers seem a bit off, the rep was patched many times to boost the rep, once in late Classic, once in TBC and once in WotLK - I started grinding at the lowest possible rep, when I was level 46, hit Revered at level 58, at which point I had about 2/3 of the items required to get to Exalted.
---
True. I remember lots of deaths to Anubarak, healers having huge issues with mana before first boss of azjol nerub where 3 packs were pulling one after another and you couldn't drink inbetween. Pinnacle had some boss that hit like a truck I remember also. The other nerubian dungeon also was quite challenging at first. Doing the boss where adds cant reach the master was challenging, last boss was challenging coz people couldnt kill their copies on time ect.   
---
Meanwhile in Classic as lvl 54 shadow priest in lvl30-40 gear I am healing no problem lvl 55 warrior tanking emperor in BRD with no issues, except for having to pop one mana potion.
---
I've been peaceful on the alliance. I always see an undead lock named Hexakill in my quest areas. I assume he has a similiar schedule to myself. We have helped each other out of sticky situations on numerous occasions. I can't help but feel like we are brothers on opposite sides of this conflict.
---
Personally I’ll give water and food to everyone in the dungeon (I make it by the hundreds first thing when I log in) because this saves me time over the course of the dungeon. But there are costs associated with the training and my problem was more with you saying you have a problem with tipping in general. You can tip a mage 1 Gold for 120 max level water(a full trade window) and its a fraction of the cost for you and shows you appreciate their effort and their initial cost to learn and craft it.

More so the racials are more useful.  Gnome only has Escape Artist (that benefits rogues) which in itself is nice.
---
That's the retail minds set those people have. They'll learn eventually that you can't just run and gun in classic.
---
You would need a castsequence macro since sf is on the gcd
---
$15 a month is cheaper than a quality dominatrix.
---
It's good over long periods uninterrupted grinding.  Personally I avoid it in favor of int/stam because successful PvP skirmishes are going to save a lot more time in the long run.
---
I did the ones in duskwallow till 35-41 bought my mount with the grays sales and turtle scale and cooking. I dont ever want to fight turtles again though
---
what is shift+s is desparate prayer for me, will it activate my 10m cooldown?  Guess I'll find out tonight!
---
Also, is it alt+PScreen to get active window for multi-monitor users?
---
Pilot's getting ganked.
---
This is a shortsighted view.  We all felt that way in 2005.  Give it time when you start rolling alts and start complaining about dungeon attunement on your third char.  +1 stamina becomes a lot less exciting once you’re in mostly blues and purps.  
---
Blizz didn’t change WoW because they hated players, most thing were requested.
---
It’s only been TWO weeks, wait until folks start complaining about PVP and asking for balance patches.
---
All that said, I’m still having a blast just like I did 15 years ago.
---
Yea there are limits :)
---
Spam cath until 42
---
Makes sense, thanks for the tips and insight!
---
How good is the firewall of your router? Is the firmware version up to date? Or are you talking about the software firewall of your PC?
---
Rfc is 13-16 then WC 17-21/22
---
I use [ccc](https://github.com/shirsig/ccc) to time polys.
---
I use it every time I need to drink.
---
Is there a way to add a tag to someone by their name?  Maybe an add-on?  
---
Would be nice to be able to label people 'ninja looter' so you know to alert the group should you see them join a raid.
---
How was you recording the right tiem, Streaming?
---
Min char level for mara is 48 but max is 47?
---
Ayy there's the relationship advice I've come to know and love from the internet
---
Hahahaha this is a funny thought
---
This seems pretty good. Gonna try this in 10 minutes after eating some chicken ramen
---
Oh so you pay the mage to summon food in cities yet you tell the mage to summon bread and water for the party in a dungeon/raid without tips?
---
Interesting entitlement I see
---
I'm 31 as shadow and it's piss easy. Just bring water. Mind blast the odd mob for spirit tap. Most of the time you're wanding and not spamming heals.
---
&gt; absolutely lose their shit again yelling at me about pulling agro. They cuss me out, try to let me die to 'teach me a lesson', or flat out kick me from the party.
---
God complexes, man. I absolutely hate healers and tanks that freak out about this shit. Total drama queens. Even if you DID pull aggro--they're going to let you die? That's their play? 
---
Fuck people with that mentality.
---
When I played vanilla I played with this kid who was always filthy rich. He was always playing the AH and what not so I figured he did that on top of buying gold (he was a rich kid from Connecticut). We were part of a good raiding guild at the time that was number 2 alliance on the server and he was always contributing 100+ gold a week (he even gave me 800 gold out of the blue because I helped him level from 50-60).
---
Well turns out he was stealing people’s credit cards online and buying gold with them. Our GM was contacted by Blizzard that they have been investing the guild and all of our users because of a “gold scam going on on the server”. They found out who it was and banned his account, I remember talking to one of his buddies on MySpace and he was arrested/fined for it. Crazy shit.
---
There are no definitive population numbers as Blizzard has not released any.  Any type of numbers you see are from strawpolls.
---
Ganking a lowbie 10 on 1?
---
Look I am not a fan of fking Asmon but there are tons of retards in that raid.I'd be pissed af tho.
---
Faster weapon for rage generation is what I've heard. Also demo shout on multi target isn't the only thing you should use. It is the first thing to use but from there use revenge and sunder as well. Atleast that's what I've done and held agro just fine. Also battle shout I think also does threat but I need to do some testing
---
It would still negate the purpose of terrain &amp; physical barriers. If we're just talking world PvP, then choke points have always been the catalyst for world PvP.

---
My Rogue's name is Wetwerk, like Wet Work with a play on the Patchwerk theme. My buddies: "We twerkin'!"
---
"  Nothing about Classic forced this. Maybe a little bit. But we could all roll hunter lock and solo everything and get LFG addons.  "
---
Hunter? HELL NO, almost useless in raids lol.
---
Mage? Yeah
---
His popularity is nothing short of amazing to me. YouTube keeps recommending his vifs cuz I watched one randomly.. Like most of these narcissistic streamers, he really is the worst
---
Let them die!!!
---
This was helpful info., thank you! Do you know if Slam is something worth picking up and using in your rotation if you’re spec’d Fury?
---
Dungeons are spread throughout the world, the higher the level dungeon the farther from a city it usually is. For now, you can try Ragefire Chasm in Orgrimmar (you can get there by the zeppelin outside Undercity) and soon Wailung Caverns in The Barrens.
---
Yes sir!!!! My boys!!!
---
Yeah I agree having a streamer play in a overpopulated server just makes more problems and second I really enjoy his react videos and transmog competition videos than his gameplay videos just saying (I got off topic here sry)
---
Good points man.
---
Thanks Delu
---
How so? Overpower is a proc, sunder does no damage, and rend is a dot that needs applied once. HS just deals increased AA damage. If he’s just fighting mobs I don’t see the need for sunder. Depending on downtime between mobs he may lose the rage anyways so why not spend it on HS?
---
I have several like this. Play for an hour or two once a week to use up the rest.
---
slow fall? buy some light feathers theyre dirt cheap bro
---
It also sounds a lot like the numerous addons that will automatically sell all grey items whenever you talk to a vendor. Those have been around since vanilla, and have never been controversial.
---
Run to the zeppelin at UC and fly to durotar and run to valley of trials. Tell your buddy to do the same from Mulgore. You will both have access to class trainers there , razor hill, and orgrimmar . Only place you two can meet up as thunder bluff has no warlock trainers and shamans have no trainer in UC.
---
I loved how i got my epic hunter bow/staff from the hunter quest in a new server, then just doing aimed shot multi shot normal shot to almost kill every cloth user in bgs. Even my friends who had geared character loved to use my hunter to pop some mages in bgs. ahhh the good times.
---
Devil's advocate here. Often times if dps are pulling it means they are telling you it's ok to pull more. 
---
As a tank, you need to resolve the situation by figuring out if the group is in fact capable of handling larger and faster pulls or if people are just that impatient. I've been on both sides of the arguement where dps just mindlessly pull and I've also seen tanks pull needlessly slow.
---
It's ok. You are not alone. I didnt know either back in ye olden days
---
I haven't had any trouble as a Bear tank with Demoralizing Roar, Swipe, and Tab target Mauls for threat in normal groups. 
---
With these crazy Pull Everything AoE Cleave 3 Mage/Warlock groups I just get as much Agro as I can on the heavy hitters, keep the mess off the healer as much as I can and let the DPS die if they can't kite.
---
I'm not about to sweat agro when the group obviously doesn't want to follow the mechanics as they were designed.
---
That said, find out which of your abilities gains the most threat (For Bear Druids it's Maul) and use that to build single target threat when you can.
---
Also CC, CC, CC! Rogues, Mages, Druids (beast), Warlocks (elemental/demon), Priests (Undead), Hunters (Trap) all have CC abilities. If your groups aren't using them, they have no right to complain when they're drawing threat.
---
I know that guess why. Because I am psychic.
---
Then don't raid with him.
---
What's the point of this post?
---
I threw my Credit Card at my phone....nothing happened.
---
I refuse to watch those assclowns, but I've gotta say it's more disappointing than I imagined hearing how streamers - and that one in particular - are behaving. Bad examples gonna examole badly.
---
I didn't say anything about being the biggest contributor, I said it was one of the 1000 cuts that killed the game. I agree, LFG was a much bigger impact.
---
That's a terrain design issue. You can still create choke points with a flying mount like I describe
---
Wrong, kaiba.
---
WHAT DID THE TURTLES DO TO YOU?? T_T
---
Touché
---
Hate to break it to you, but clearing quickly is the default now. You are going to need to clarify when you are making the group that you plan to go slowly.
---
I REALLY wanna know how many people are playing classic.
---
I'm only a level 6 hunter (I never have time to play) and I'm debating going either LW or eng. Idk which one will help me most and I know mining/eng takes longer than LW/skinning. Eng is just fun to have all those gadgets
---
The number of players is somewhat forcing this.  I've been coping pretty well up until STV.  You have both factions filtering into the same zone doing the same quests.  Mobs of all types, everywhere, are constantly spawn killed.  This could have you running around for over 30 minutes to finish a single quest.  If you want to actually progress your xp bar and not keep feeling like you're running around aimlessly, grinding dungeons becomes a great alternative to keep progressing your character.
---
I never ran prot for this reason... I'd rather let us wipe than run around in a panic. I'll /laugh as I watch the mage running around like an idiot. I'd give two or three warnings. If they still didn't listen... pull three groups and bubblehearth.
---
&gt;So we have to haul ass just to make sure they don't die.
---
Alternatively, let them die.  They'll figure it out eventually.
---
If you gang up at 7 or 8 vs 1, you may have a chance
---
oops. yea I mistype
---
Sure thing whatever makes you happy. I'll put it simpler terms: don't take a stand against something only to later change your mind when it benefits you.
---
Both do your starting areas to level 6 and then get skills and run to Durotar, working through Sen’jin village and up to Razor Hill. Warlock and Shaman trainers there for all your quests but you’ll have to split up for your level 10’s.
---
I need this and it's like 5g on the ah
---
.. Gonna sell deviate fish instead to make the gold.
---
Idk, I liked them in Outland because it made sense and didn’t trivialize Azeroth (where they were not permitted). They should have been an Outland-only thing and never existed in Northrend or elsewhere
---
I'm not well-versed on Fury. I'd recommend checking out the guide on Icy-Veins for leveling as Fury. It's really good at giving rotation and what skills to level.
---
If you don’t know about back peddling in classic get out of here.
---
Just like the report button on reddit for people that harass you like the two that replied to me. :) 
---
It's great.
---
Im lvl a lvl 56 warlock and im in no rush atm.  
---
Gotten already most of my pre-raid bis gear, gotten tailoring and enchanting to 300 and still preparing for some things to craft and enchant.  
---
I have done 0 dungeon grinding, just the quests and needed gear and then just continue doing quests and its super enjoyable! every now and then helped my friends aswell as they're lacking in lvl's with occasional gank squads and overall just helping with questing when i can.  
---
So umm... yeah im not going back to retail as nothing there feels as rewarding as in classic
---
Fair enough, to each their own.
---
I dont know why you're so dead set on this strange flying mount modification idea.
---
Never on par with a warrior but an acceptable susbstitute pre-60. In end game prot paladins are generally considered a total meme spec. They can  tank end game dungeons, but its rife with problems - mana, threat, and survivability issues.
---
Understood. I was hoping to get some idea by people sharing their experiences since that's all we can do.
---
That's Asmongold, thats why he has viewers he's cringey. The people in the raid know and understand there's a chance they will get shamed. Some people love him some don't mind him. Overrall I believe he's 100% an act, I'd even go on a limb and say his trash pile up is all a gimmick and it's brought him so much content I have to give him credit he's an entertainer who has a following.
---
You may need to refresh the chart, I've made a few edits to it in the past hour or so!
---
I was originally incorrect in my assumption that you stop getting xp from mobs once you're 5 levels above them. I understand now that this minimum scales as your character level increases, and have updated all of the data accordingly!
---
I'm currently listening to a book series called Critical Failures (Caverns and Creatures). It's a quick/fun listen or read.
---
Long story short it's about a group or friends that play dungeons and dragons (aka caverns and creatures in the book) together and end up getting teleported into the game.
---
Mutants chest.
---
Saaaaaame
---
I think the confusion comes from Post Malone being a nobody to the majority of people. I had to look him up lol.
---
So I've done this, but I'm kind of a noob (haven't played a lot of WoW).  Anyhow, how much rest xp can they accumulate?  How often should i burn through it?  have 2 alts sitting in inns right now at level 5, and dont' want to waste it.  Thanks!
---
I just want the one pvp mod I had back in Vanilla that had classic Quake sound affects for multi kills, killing sprees and such, God I loved that addon.
---
Talent points I'm good about using right away. Skill level-ups is another story.....I went like 7 levels before I remembered to go upgrade my Sinister Strike and Eviscerate, and couldn't figure out why my dps was slowly plummeting.
---
I represent this... I MEAN RESENT! (feigns death)
---
Every few levels in Wow I'll get a blue from some instance or elite quest reward, and get all giddy about it.  I don't get that feeling in any other modern MMO.  Modern games don't capture that anymore.  they lack replability and throw gear.  They are short lived experiences, and usually boring after a few days.
---
I play a Tauren. Was waiting in Booty Bay to get a gnomer group together. I’m able to physically obscure the goblins, so I stand on top of one of the quest givers in the inn. In 5 mins watched 4 different alliance die to guards as they accidentally attack me. For the lulz.
---
Oh yeah not low levels but against that rogue... can taste the sweet sweet revenge
---
Yeah I dont heal them if they start a fight with 20% hp. If I've gotta waste money on water you can too bud. Dont spend the time everyone else is using to drink on cutting yourself for mana and flipping your hair emoically.
---
The worst of it is that the dungeons themselves are great, but we never get to enjoy them because, as you said, people just wanna fly through them as quickly as possible. 
---
I was so excited for Waycrest Manor. I mean it's literally a HAUNTED MANOR. Dark hallways, spooky music, dreary courtyard with a fountain, eerie pictures on the walls, everything. And you'll spend maybe 7 or 8 minutes there sprinting through at breakneck speed. I wanna look around and enjoy it!
---
*hey bitch, wait'll you see my threat*
---
So yellow hits have the same chance to hit as white hits?
---
Tank your way up, Respec holy at 60
---
I use heroic strike for the extra chance to hit and if I’m killing 1x1 it really doesn’t matter if I waste rage I’ll be at 0 from execute.
---
But I am with 3 little ones, one of which is only a month old... but i wanted the joke :-)
---
No keybinds and internet explorer. Homies really in 2004
---
Word
---
After looking, I think he's thinking of the strong fishing pole you can buy in limited amounts in STV.  On my server that's selling for 60s and gives +5 skill.  There are none of the +20's on the AH.
---
Pretty good, considering I don't have a discreet graphic card. Mine is a 13-inch 2016. It is set to Graphics Quality 9 and runs ~24 FPS. That setting is too high for my system. But I usually play on a "proper" gaming PC. And I sync my Classic settings and addons between the two. Which means the PC's graphic settings are carried over to the MacBook Pro. I'm usually not on the laptop enough to warrant lowering the graphics. Then remembering to raise them again on the PC.  
---
The fan runs with the game up. And my battery life goes to hell. I plugged in a power bank shortly after taking the photo.
---
Not all groups have four melee dps plus a lock.
---
Their statement was that the abuse wasn't as widespread as was being reported and that they found and debunked the claims they had about banks full of exploited items/mats. That kind of thing is easy for them to check, just database queries and some searches through logs. I bet they have scripts for it already. I have no reason to doubt Blizzard on it because it doesn't seem worth lying about. Time will tell I guess but seems legit.
---
I didn't say an exploit like that wouldn't effect the server, I said it doesn't effect my gameplay, as in my personal experience, and that it doesn't seem to have taken hold on Myzrael. Hence I don't care so much. Just how I am dealing with it.
---
I remember vanilla. The economy devolved to overpriced BoE world drops, crafted blues for twinks/casuals, consumables for raids/DM-Tribute runs, and farmed materials. That is where we will end up again but even faster because people are more focused in classic having been conditioned on how to min-max and grind over the years. Hard to care about any possible effect layers will have when we literally already know where the economy is going to end up. The #nochanges mentality ensures that.
---
They never took the time to scale and expand the crafting in any meaningful way. The game is more focused on drops than a player driven crafting economy so the economy will always sort of suck, IMO.
---
The reason folks would get banned is because using layers to accelerate levels or node farming is not the intended use of that feature. Blizzard has done bans for similar exploits before; even called it out in bluetext, iirc. I don't know if they will bother doing that for classic but the precedent exists.
---
You don't have to agree, it is just my opinion bases what is going in my server so far.
---
Happy hunting, I hope you don't let all this noise hamper your enjoyment.
---
Sage
---
Heroic is my goto spell on my warrior my main roto is charge, attack, Rend, attack, heroic strike attack and then just spam overpower whenever able to or heroic strike, until execute range. I have sunder on my bar but don’t use it much as I thought it was mainly for tanks. I’m a fury troll dual wield warrior and am doing great dps with heroic strike, even though it takes rage, using dual wield can fill me up quick. I will have to try the sunder armor strat but I feel like it’s a move that doesn’t do any damage and just loses rage.
---
I have not stopped reading this since i saw this post. I love every bit of it, it goes pretty much up to cata it appears, wish he kept it going and did the other expansions but oh well.
---
I doubt a couple of bracers and leggings will kill the economy lol
---
You dont have to use stealth a ton while leveling if you dont want to. Combat Rogues can be played a lot like Fury warriors.
---
Oh I agree. Not all warriors have enough int for that though!
---
That reminds me of when I first started and didn't know how to leave Darnassus through the pink glowy portal thing. I kept trying to jump off Teldrassil.
---
Why not just use the one's that Blizzard has in the settings? I personally love the default battle text and wish it would be put back in retail (actually I don't play retail anymore so idc).
---
And even for the Enterprise, we are all strongly incentivized to move off of Windows 7 and onto 10. Where I work we are slowly but surely migrating business groups. Yes there is a lot of resistance and pushback, but it must be done.
---
And we use many legacy apps dating back to the days of Windows 3.11, which haven't been updated and the original in-house developers have long moved on. Lovely isn't it.
---
take solace knowing those players get nervous when they see enemies only 2 levels lower than them.
---
bunch of MonkaS priests inside
---
Considering the cobalt crusher is a 2h mace I don't know where you'd talk about rogues. Could be used on a warrior, or enh shaman.
---
I did this as a 39 hunter and managed to get it down, tho even our tank who was 44 at the time struggled with hitting it.
---
\+1
---
You should let people know up front.
---
Because there's a difference between constructive criticism and harassment. You can tell someone their tanking needs improvement without calling them "fucking trash".
---
Forgot about debuff limits, edited.
---
Right. When it's possible and not too much a risk, I'll save them, but quite frankly, if someone gets on my nerves all instance long by making my job harder than it has to be, you can bet that guy is dying a few times before the run is over, like every time his survival isn't relevant to the rest of the group's survival.
---
Basically, my priorities are...
---
* Keeping the tank alive.
---
* Keeping myself alive.
---
* Keeping the tank topped off.
---
* Keeping the best DPS alive.
---
* Keeping myself topped off.
---
* Joking with guildmates in chat.
---
* Keeping the best DPS topped off.
---
* Healing bad DPS.
---
OP's guild killed Rag already while you are still looking for a SM group
---
You don't have to do every dungeon, or any dungeon to be honest. But I think it is best for the leveling experience if you do some.
---
It's so annoying right? Kinda like being told classic wont last cause it's a bad game and people are just wanting the nostalgia.
---
A similar version of this happened to me yesterday. Was just questing in duskwood on my 27 mage and saw a priest. Asked him if he wanted water and gave him 3 stacks. The dude gave me a 50 silver tip just because "I didn't even ask for water and you offered it to me"
---
Slow but fun.
---
Blackened Defias 19 twink is pretty easy to make. The armour pieces go for silver on the AH.
---
Imagine having a brain.

as many times the hunter does something stupid jn ur dungeongroup (alot) btw i play huntard
---
it's trash(sorry Microsoft). Install Greenshot and avast with that abomination which is the Snipping Tool.
---
Live in Missouri, play on US East (servers are located in Chicago, IL). Get a constant 13ms ping with Google Fiber. Was getting around 60ms before I switched providers less than 2 weeks ago. Don't really notice a difference in terms of latency.
---
Seconded.
---
Umm...phrasing?
---
I typically tip way more for people not asking for a tip. Common courtesy.
---
As soon as I hit 40 I switched over to MM and I do so much more dmg now. 
---
My pet doesnt seem any weaker either and holding aggro is about the same except now I'm getting 1k aim shot crits and I can actually do world pvp.
---
this may be true but as a healer fuuuckkkkkk youuuuuu, sometimes in the heat of battle and dropping heals to make sure people don't die when you see a person at %5 health its a little worrisome, and while you may be able to heal your self, all it takes for one mob to turn and one hit you, now we are getting yelled at for letting you die. straight up told my friend if he is going to use hellfire im not healing him, he gets a shield and nothing else.
---
....is this in response to someone or something?
---
Literally the highest upvoted post ever on this sub is people talking about how they're in no rush to reach 60.
---
Also, Bloodsail Buccaneers is an RP realm not PvP.
---
I dropped over 50ms switching from Grobb to DD (now at 39).  Depends on who you ask whether that matters, but was only one reason for the switch for me.
---
yeah, i was in duskwood running between darkshire and raven hill so many times when i saw a rogue 5 levels higher than me who had resurrection sickeness. I sent my voidwalker after him, followed as close as i could as we dodged around trees and spiders and finally landed a couple dots on him until he died.
---
Rogues are the most common Twink, so just recommending the best weapons there. A lot of people fall for the Swords trap.
---
Corpsemaker is much better than cobalt for both Warriors and Enh, and it’s free.
---
I remember doing ramparts in the beta for BC. I was a warlock in like half MC-AQ20-ZG epics with some early bc quest greens, my friend was a fully epic warrior with a couple t2.5 pieces, tank was in t3, healer was in t2 with some aq40 epics, rogue was in a mix of t2 and t3.
---
We died on the first pull 3 times. I think we made it to the 2rd or 3rd group before we gave up. That dungeon was so ridiculously overturned we couldn't even make it halfway to the first boss.
---
So when one of you horde pig-dogs try to take my rich thorium node, I can show you why that was a mistake. 
---
But if you’re dying to a spider, you’re damn skippy ima jump on that nope and save your repair bill.
---
My favorite is when the aoe mages and warlocks run between pillars cancelling my heals
---
It's faster to travel but it takes longer to access and demands more your attention to catch it. The FP is closer to access, you jump in, then take a bathroom break, go to the fridge to grab a snack or alt tab and go read some /r/classicwow/.
---
I try to have a couple stacks ready for all the casters in my group and some food for anyone who wants it, just seems smart and polite, you're a team!

Not sure if he main tanked.  It was late and I was tired.  Here is the link if you want to check it out. [Esfand MC Prot](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/478831819)
---
I’m sorry for your loss. I know how you feel. My late husband got me into Vanilla back in the day, we played for a little bit here and there together. He passed away 8 months ago, and when classic came out, it was difficult to start playing because I wish he could be here with me playing side by side again like old times. Stay strong.
---
I’d give him a spoon and say here you can eat my ass.
---
It really won't make a difference in a majority of situations since the server batches spells and events in 400ms ticks.
---
Kms?
---
Its likely at least part of it

Just regular prtsc allows you to copy into chat on a single monitor tho doesn’t it?
---
They aren't giving you a completely fixed up version of Vanilla.  They're giving you as close to 1.12 as they can.  Trade being filled with LFG is as Vanilla as it gets.
---
There's a friends list in game. I think you can add notes to them. If not, I'm quite sure you can do it with their battle.net.

Other than that, go the old school route; print screen and remember

Ez-thro dynamite 👍🏼
---
Do you notice a difference?
---
You can't twink open world, which is the only pvp available...
---
&gt;real reason this game is
---
For sure! I mean, even back in the day, comparing it to the next largest MMO at the time (Everquest 2) and it looks crazy cartoonish. And honestly....it is so much better. People arent complaining because the water isn't gleaming like real water, the shores aren't dynamic really, the colors are crazy, its amazing.
---
They fixed it with blind to loose all your combo points. I expect them to fix it with kick but I will try it tonight

Wish someone would photoshop some alliance appropriate gear on this dude for meme purposes.

Affliction Warlocks get most of their damage from wands, don’t they?
---
Fuck multi boxers
---
As someone who is extremely rusty on MOST dungeons, I can tell you that most people are very forgiving. After all, they usually need a tank pretty bad..

thank you.

MUH GRUNDRUL RUMP LELELELE

No hurry.

Don't lock it to same faction marking opposing faction for kill on sight or wave would be nice also

I play lock and life tap down to nothing all the time. However I cannabalize often and give some drink to healers if I have spare

Yah, the retail version is just a glorified slot machine.  
---
**Retail loot**
---
- grey: trash
---
- white: trash
---
- green: trash
---
- blue: only used for levelling
---
- purple: what ilevel? Nice now I can try to get the exact same piece with bigger numbers on it next week
---
**Classic loot**
---
- grey: at least it can be an upgrade
---
- white: alright
---
- green: good
---
- blue: veeery good, can be even BiS due to a unique mechanic
---
- purple: suuuuper good, not gonna find this often but when you do, you will feel like superman
---
Thank you for this quick reference chart!
---
'Min heals lvl' should instead just be the Min lvl to enter the dun. Let the groups figure out if healer can handle it based off skill, gear, DPS off-healers.
---
Maybe a Quest available at level column?
---
This is classic vanilla. I was fueled by mountain dew, microwave michalinas, and god damn warheads. I ate so much warheads my mouth bled. I dunno wtf was wrong with 19 year old wow addicted me. But he was wild and had to get everything as fast as possible.

You are 100% aloud to use electronics on a plane. Not sure what Airlines you use, but its after 10,000 ft with no cellular service has always been aloud, before aside from take off and landing.

That's great and originally you said there were too many to buy them all out. Had you not said that, this would have been my suggestion. I would prepare yourself for a bunch of people to continuously undercut you if you leave them at 50s, but good on you for making the right move.

---
It's what's inside that counts... that's beautiful
---
Does the newer rank not just replace the older ranked skill on your bar?  Could have sworn mine did
---
1 Always be the person to pull. Anyone else being the first on the kill list means you need 10% more threat than them to take over the treat lead. Mark target via macro. 
---
2. Always pull with a ranged weapon. While the enemy is running to your location use blood rage. This creates threat before they get to you. 
---
3. With the rage from blood rage use battle shout. If threat is an issue battle shout again and then dem shout. Battle shout will provide threat without pulling additional mobs. Dem shout will pull close by mobs. Be careful. 
---
4. Shield block before any mobs hit you to garaunteed a revenge immediately and get strong threat on main target. 
---
5. Use sunder as your primary attack.
---
My job as a healer is NOT to heal dps that pulled aggro by attacking the wrong target.
---
If you pulled by legitimately yanking the right target off the tank, via crits or something.  Yes, you get healed.
---
If you can't follow 15-year old understood dungeoning, you can die.
---
No taunt and no mana. They're bad.
---
Yeah. Generally you want stats. Greens typically dont provide a whole lot of stats like blues do. If you were to go in with some plus healing greens you would literally get one shot by rogues and completely shredded by hunters. Also you can get a ton of spell power from enchants. Those bis lists you are seeing from private servers are nearly identical to the ones we used in vanilla.
---
 I personally dont like the 19 bracket much. I played my twinks at 19 for a while but ended up going up to the higher brackets (49 shaman in tbc, 19/29/39 rogue in vanilla) the higher brackets are more fun cause you have more abilities but the 19 bracket is a bit more competitive because there are so many more twinks. 
---
Holding onto like lvl 18 or 19 greens can be profitable but not nearly as much as the blues. Also depending on class a lot of the twink gear is just farmed. Even the good boes can be farmed at lvl 60 since a lot of them drop in only specific places.
---
That’s a good point! I do tend to forget about Engineering as I’ve never, ever properly used it. I’ve flirted with the idea for PVP but, I haven’t actually bothered to level it past the requirement for the flying tiger goggles
---
It won't.  At least, it certainly doesn't make me not want to play.
---
Can you tell it to record only a select portion of the screen and not the whole thing a la MacOS?
---
Fuck Arcatraz when I was playing on feenix for awhile I ran it once. To do attunement, I absolutely hate that place because of how much of a pain it was when it was released.
---
Was it because of Ashvane mythic? :D
---
Nah, it's fine.
---
Oh yeah man we still have OGs playing BFA, Increds are still doing server first alliance kills on boulderfist, but yeah we're happy with Classic so far.
---
Ragnarok Online.
---
Modern WoW groups are horrible, so you're not alone in hating it.  I really miss the days of calculated pulls and using skill to fight through dungeons in classic WoW.  And everyone being nice to each other throughout.
---
Taken with a cell phone...
---
there we surveys on this sub. No official count from Blizz though. I think they avoid doing that because then all the people in the minority would xfer/reroll and make the problem even worse
---
I would not use Windfury weapon on a 2 hander as it's not efficient. You might not proc it until the mob has only a silver of health left. Instead, use Rockbiter if you're just grinding and questing. More consistent. DO NOT use Rockbiter in an instance unless you're tanking for some reason ... or you will be, lol.
---
For Enhancement Shamans, Agility is very important as you proc faster attacks with crits. I'd place that ahead of Strength, although it does have diminishing returns if you put too much into it. At least I recall that being the case in Vanilla.
---
I wouldn't dip into Ele if you're primarily Enh. Instead, Res has better bang for the buck in the form of less mana for heals (Tidal Focus), less mana cost for your totems (Totemic Focus), wider range for your totems (Totemic Mastery), and the absolutely amazing Nature's Guidance to increase the chances to hit with your weapons and spells.
---
Now this is my personal opinion. Dipping into Ele will certainly boost your dps and your klll speed ... but at the cost of draining your mana quick. Much like other hybrid classes, the best way to use your mana is to frontload your mana usage right away and then just auto attack while your spirit regens your mana. So Lighting Shield -&gt; Totems -&gt;  Some damaging spell to pull with -&gt; bash bash bash until dead. And if you can, keep pulling into the same general spot so you don't have to recast your longer lasting totems. This is how I find it best for me. But if you rely heavily on Ele for damage, not only is it draining mana fast, it also won't regen it as you're constantly casting. Spirit mana regen only kicks in after 5 seconds from your last cast.
---
Obviously, equipment also plays a part, so make sure your gear is up to date.
---
60, just chilling now doing dungeons for pre raid BIS and proffesions
---
Sometimes not possible if your dps are too low level. We ignored adds with 1 group and it worked (but only because I as the healer used soul stone after i inevitably got heal aggro because the tank was too low level to taunt them reliably) but when we tried this with another group, namely the afore-mentioned one with only a single player lvl 43, we couldn't burn him down fast enough. The elites do quite a lot of damage.
---
I love everything about this. Fuckin' *decent*.

I spend my talent points within 5 seconds of leveling every time.

I am smart.

As wow aged and evolved it started taking that theme park label a little too literally.

As a human rogue, hardiness is so annoying. I've had times where they resisted both my cheap shot and kidney shot opener. On the bright side, my perception lets me get the jump on them if I know they are around.

If you use Lutris, you could just setup pre-launch / post-lauch commands that modify the TTL. That way you can just keep your usual default TTL for normal usage. Your way is probably fine, but changing the TTL across the board could have other implications.

Might as well not train your abilities too

When I was in Elwynn Forest and tried to kill Hogger on my own, a high level undead rogue appeared and instead of killing my low-level ass, he killed Hogger with/for me. First time I had a good experience with Undead Rogues ever

He's not sensitive, he's full of himself. You don't owe him anything. It's the mages' privilege to be able to conjure food and water. Sure, you wanna be nice and make food and water for anyone who asks because why the hell would you not, but that doesn't mean you are obliged to.

Wasnt this a big from the beta that blizzard patched? Fd is bugged too currently I wonder why all these "fixes" didnt make it to live.

I may lose interest in Classic, and I might go back to Retail. But those two things won't be connected. Me going back to Retail will have nothing to do with how fun Classic is, and me being bored of Classic will for sure not make me want to play Retail. 
---
If the next expansion brings Retail's design closer to that of Classic's, this might change. However, one good expansion can't undo years of abuse. You can't remove Cata's zone revamps. You can't take Void Elves out of the game. 
---
I am far more excited about something like WoW Classic and a WoW2, than I am about playing Retail.
---
then whats the right way?
---
I mean that does remind me of the old raiding days. Back in vanilla and even BC I would see people get kicked from the GUILD for accidentally causing a wipe or being blacklisted from loot for weeks (and i mean absolutely no loot, if you were the only person who wanted it at all it would simply be DE'd) it was a rough environment for some people in the higher ranked guilds but for most of us that is what we knew.

I don’t even have shadowbolt in my bar outside of a short period in Stonetalon trying to kill fire elementals with a fire damage wand. Now I try to carry a fire wand *and* a shadow wand.

Can anyone recommend a youtube video that explains the basics?  I’ve looked but haven’t had much luck.  Thanks!

Thunderstomp is the best. Gorillas are amazing for leveling, they can actually keep aggro on a group

Last night I was questing in Hillsbrad and managed to pull too many mobs, lucky for me I was able to hold my own and it looked like I was going to survive the fight with just a sliver of health left, but then a gnome mage runs up and started giving the bear I'm fighting first aid!!
---
I died.
---
What level is that?
---
How do you do that?
---
That's apples and oranges though. Private servers aren't official so if they make changes to game play that's on them and it's not accurate to the official version. Most of the stuff in the official game was balanced around the hardware delay so changes would throw it off from the original version so it's the private servers that are in the bad on this one, and if that's too much of an issue then go back to the private servers then since they are obviously superior in your eyes anyways.
---
Spent so long in retail.
---
Group of three of us waiting for Hogger. Paladin rolls up. I /say, /w and invite him to group. He declines the invite and ignores any attempt at communication.
---
Hogger spawns. He's first on the tag. We watch his health bar drop like the Hindenburg. He attempts to run at like half health but he only makes it like 50 feet. Hogger resets and we down him in &lt;10 seconds.
---
Postscript : The Paladin rezzed. While I was still in the area doing gnoll  armbands, Hogger respawned. The Paladin invited me. I accepted.
---
I just find it ridiculous if the game can't be beaten without using stuff outside the game (addons), doesn't how how hard you try
---
Thank you! That's a relief to hear
---
No, your job is to do everything in your power to keep everyone alive. 
---
It's entirely possible to keep everyone up in almost all situations, unless you suck. Do you suck?
---
Very true. Learning not to H strike was something I always had trouble with. Its tough to get into that fight then just sit there.
---
As a nelf hunter when I join groups I say 'growl is turned off and pet is on passive, nice to meet you'
---
i'm having a blast and enjoy it. i level'd a rogue in vanilla and also doing one now. feel about the same. ie. fun. i'm leveling as backstab (combat). got good cash flow, tear into anything in PvE and doing ok in PvP (only 30 so don't have all my tools yet).
---
This is handy, thank you.
---
You should switch to rp server. The rage I feel from this posts fits the warrior class nicely.
---
If you wipe the raid because you aren’t able to simply run from one point to another 20 feet away, you shouldn’t be doing raids yet because your comprehension isn’t there yet
---
That's really interesting to me, how's your experience been? We specifically avoided Faerlina, not due to the streamers but do to their audiences (not that we think they're all bad, just were worried about the possibilities).
---
Due to that we went on Stalagg (Alliance) which has an apparently well-known private server guild. I haven't interacted with many of them, but I have seen one of them repeatedly while leveling - and this dude is the absolute best. I try to be helpful (heal/buff randos, rez corpses, even gave out extra bags and weapons/gear to lowbies); I partly do this for class fantasy (pally-bro) and partly because that's how I remember my Vanilla experience mostly being, but this guy blows even me out of the water. He helped with quests outside of the group while waiting on his dungeon group, he's offered help in general chat multiple times, and even summoned someone in the same zone without being asked once when he randomly joined my group.
---
Lichface, if you're around here, you're legit AF in my book. I would follow you into the depths of the Undercity itself.

Well, what I'm saying is that there are known knowns and that there are known unknowns. But there are also unknown unknowns; things we don't know that we don't know.

I am in Texas and play on an Eastern server.  My pin is around 20ms constant.
---
Yes and no, it depends on the weapon type.
---
If you’re dual wielding, your white hits have a lot lower chance to hit. And then, yes, yellow hits (like sinister strike for rogues) will have a higher chance to hit than white hits. Because they use the hit chance of just the main hand weapon.
---
But for 2h weapons, white hits and yellow hits both use the hit chance of a 2h weapon.
---
Gre-heasy.
---
Ah ok then, Stv is only +5, already got that, the traps should be +20. Given the drop rate I suspect few other than fellow fishermen would go after it in the beginning, but again money can probably be made by people too lazy to farm it after a while.
---
For horde at least that makes a steady income from common drops like Shellfish, farming that area for a long time might net them a couple of extra poles to sell ^^
---
I'm the tank.... That's literally why I made the group. If YOU want to bumrush through dungeons then YOU find a group that wants that. Most people don't want that. Just because you think it's the best way to play doesn't mean it is.
---
The tank is the group leader, period. If the tank tells you to slow the fuck down then you slow the fuck down.

LFG was actually implemented during WotLK

Same I came back to OSRS when mobile came out and played it a ton, but now classic came out so bye bye osrs
---
I'm Horde, admittedly, but I've certainly seen plenty of Alliance around in STV on Incendius. Most have been passive, so we just all go about our business. 
---
There's definitely still a good amount of PvP that happens as well, of course. But in most cases, if you don't instigate, people will leave you alone.
---
In addition to what everyone else mentioned, you can go back and do all the quests you missed while leveling and flaunt your incredible power over the lowbies!
---
Calm down shredder
---
I mean, Wow is a game meant to be played in third person, so being in VR defeats the main purpose of first person VR.
---
at level 38, you have 4/5 elemental mastery, 5/5 convection, clearcasting, 5/5 lighting crit and a new rank of lightning bolt.
---
Combined with stacking int, a shield, and any spell power, you kill significantly faster with a overall high mana efficiency.
---
Its tankier, can heal without needing a new gear set, and does significantly better damage all at range.
---
Yep, thats the ticket!
---
Weirdly enough because Microsoft technologies keeps me employed...at least, it's one of the technologies that does...I'll use them for both work and home uses.
---
MacOS for some things, Windows 10 for others, all love/hate.
---
Yellow hits have a higher hit chance and also are not affected by glancing blows. If the mob is red to you heroic strike is the only way to get full damage because your white hits will be glanced and deal like 20% damage without extreme luck.
---
no coords they are on the south wall of badlands cant miss them
---
Cool idea but no way in hell they would implement ANYTHING, and I mean ANYTHING that is substantive content that wasn't in vanilla. In b4 layering because it's a method to help players have a vanilla like experience.
---
Well there’s your problem I said go check the census data and you are looking at the sampling of discord followers who read the #welcome page.
---
Didn’t downvote anything chief, don’t let the internet get you so riled.
---
about 90% of my time leveling is thinking "just 23 more quests or 375 kills until I can use another talent point."
---
Absolutely, and this is what we love doing as a guild! We have a very lively discord and if you tell me your IGN I can send over an invite :)
---
That's usually the excuse, but there's always some underlying reason someone is acting out.
---
Hey, it's ok I don't have a mount at 41. In five more levels I'll just go sit in the middle of a fur camp and never leave.

BOOOM i logged on last night at 4am EST and managed to finish north STV (every single quest including the hunters camp) in about 2 hours... that is what you can accomplish when there isnt 500 people in your zone... i did 24 quests in under 2 hours (overall XP gains, 42k per hour, gold gains 11g in 2 hours)

i did all the quests in the area faster than i would of been able to do just the bone necklaces had i attempted it during the daytime

I actually got to do 1.75 quests today. Needed like 2 more gnolls but had to leave group to drive back to work. 
---
I have a family, so any uninterrupted time I can get makes me happy lol.
---
Really curious how you think changing the talent trees led to “horrific PvE and community”.
---
I get disliking the change - some people like big expansive but restrictive trees, while others like the freedom of simple distilled tiers, I just don’t see how you make that leap to “bad pve and community”, not the least of which considering that MoP, WoD, Legion raids are heralded as some of the best the game has ever made.
---
This is why I love druids. Ex machina heals and buffs ftw.
---
I was server first Alliance 60 as a rogue on Deviate Delight, solo questing because I outleveled groups.  Took just under 6 days, 22 hours played, with zero competition for mobs or quest items after about level 15.  I mostly followed Sage's Guide.
---
You need to use everything in your toolkit.  Prioritize a high damage main hand weapon above all else.   Level first aid and either make a Gouge+Bandage macro or bind those two keys next to each other.  Use pickpocketing while leveling - it gives you healing potions, which you need. 
---
The three talents you want to get ASAP  are Riposte, Blade Flurry, and Adrenaline Rush.  
---
Use Sap to break up pulls and learn how to leash mobs to whittle down large packs. 
---
It's rough, but will make you a better player.   Good luck!
---
I truly believe the trash pile was him and he didn't realize how bad it is, and now its a gimmick. It works for him, and I'm glad he brings alot of people to the game.

Playing L4D2 versus and we just hit a mid level safe room. I had just been picked up outside the safe room and one girl gave me a stim (increased health and move faster for ~30s) and said “take it right now!” I told her I would take it when we were ready to move out of the safe room, since it’s a timed bonus that would be wasted while picking up items in the safe room. She immediately voted to kick me and her two friends voted with her.

I still sometimes think about how someone could have 1500 hours in a game but not understand basic timing.

I think a lot of people will find end game vanila healing boring as fuck so they'll reroll... Or at least I hope so lol

Nope, I tank, and I don't turn into a petty bitch when people pull aggro. I use my buttons and I take as much of the heat as possible and do everything I can to keep my group alive. What do *you* do?

This is a better story.
---
You’re a good person
---
&gt; Screenshots are faster

There's an argument to be made about photo quality and the importance of it....but as far as speed, taking a pic with my phone and uploading it with the Reddit app is faster than alt-tabbing out of my game, browsing to Reddit, and uploading a screenshot there.

The problem isn't hit chance. The problem is rage. Auto swings generate the majority of your rage. When you HS not only do you spend rage, you also dont generate any additional rage from your swing. It puts you at a rage debt essentially.

I used to play on German servers back in the day. I haven‘t heard the word Hordler in maybe 7 years. It sounds hilarious when you use it in English. Sounds like somethig Alliance would say to talk down on Horde.

Battle shout is a warriors best aoe threat generator, if it applies to your entire party.
---
More useful if you have a bunch of melee classes than if you can’t give it to your casters. If i have all melee and a hunter pet/voidwalker then battle shout comes first after thunderclap, switching to defensive of course first
---
Did your pc start spitting quarters at you out of pci slots?
---
I agree with you on that. Then wed all have a much better idea of what kind of pvp were getting into when picking a server. But itd still be really pointless when my server goes from low to high pop at random times of the day.  Worst case ill look into transferring servers if the pvp doesnt pick up  after layering. If they even make xfers available for all servers...

Yeah! I almost didnt wanna use it, but got it around level 20 cause I had never played horde before and the barrens was...interesting. so many quests in random places I never would have found
---
I used to play with 20ms in Germany to a Germany Realm.. Now I have 32ms in Alabama to a EST Realm.
---
&gt; The tank is the group leader, period. If the tank tells you to slow the fuck down then you slow the fuck down.
---
Nah, that's not accurate. It's a team game, and imo the group as a whole should push it to the limit of safety, and that doesn't include the tank tanking every mob 100-0
---
I literally love Grob so I feel like I should stay....... I'd feel like I'm moving into an empty house if I go to DD. But the ping difference is so unclear...but I guess if it doesn't bother us while we're playing maybe that means something?
---
I am considering rolling something on DD just to ping-test? But that's a time sink in itself.
---
Can you blink in from anywhere around the bubble?
---
You might be hiding one of your bags if you’re using one bag
---
&gt;But for 2h weapons, white hits and yellow hits both use the hit chance of a 2h weapon.
---
Glancing blows are combat events that can occur when fighting a mob of equal or higher level. 
---
**These occur only on white damage** and result in the attack having  its damage reduced in proportion to the difference between the  attacker's weapon skill (capped at the attacker's level \* 5), and the  target's defense skill.

---
If you’re going to aoe spam then give your tank like 5-6 seconds to build threat before going ham. A good war tank with charge, thunderclap, swap defensive and start swap-target sundering for threat. 
---
Paladins just need to stack 1-2 autos w/ righteous fury, durids have decent aoe threat to begin with.

Mankirk right now :D

Long-time WoW player (a lot of Vanilla, TBC &amp; WotLK, some MoP &amp; Legion), just recently hopped into Classic.
---
But I don't need to pull it out of my phone. I just open the Reddit app on my phone and upload it there, without having to alt-tab out of WoW and browse to Reddit to upload a screenshot.
---
69 for Rattlegore (no, really). i'm in the East and that server is West.
---
Yeah, this. Stand in between 3 boxes and by the time you start picking the third box the first one respawns. You will randomly be frost nova'd or turned into a rat, just keep clicking, you can pick locks as a rat apparently.
---
I'll go against the grain and say it's been pretty easy.  I'm level 48 and I feel like I always have ways to deal with surprises.  You've got blade flurry, evasion, and adrenaline rush to deal with pulling too many.  You have gouge, blind, and concussion? (Forgot the name of the up to 5 second stun) to get a bandage off mid combat.  Facing enemies with high armor?  Open with garrote and they bleed for big dmg.  Facing mage type enemies?  You've got kick and then they do almost no dmg to you.  Need to face a pack of 3?  Sap one for 30 seconds.  I did the Alpha Strike ferelas quest fighting whole camps of gnoles on my own using almost all abilities in some way.  Pickpocket to ensure your mount at 40.  The list goes on with the number of tools you have to answer anything thrown your way, and if all that fails just vanish.
---
This response sums it all up. Leveling guides will send you to orange zones because it’s “more efficient” is exp. it just doesn’t work like that for rogues and warriors.
---
Honestly, yes.  Less spell delay.  I also enjoy the less crowded questing hubs and chat seems a little chiller.  Both servers have too many non-rp names/conversations, but I think that will get better and isn't a big deal to me.  The level bell curve is lower level (DD more casual).  These are just anecdotal, but fit what I was looking for.
---
My spec, rumbles through the jungle.
---
Your spec, got touched by your uncle.
---
I know things have been tough on you lately Rand, so I made you this cheeseburger.
---
There are some items that are BiS that you get at a lower level and you use even in late game.  For example,  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11904/spirit-of-aquementas](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11904/spirit-of-aquementas) .
---
That said, the quest reward OP is talking about is no big deal.  It isn't like they turned in the quest for furbolg form and lost the ability to be a furbulg.
---
Yeah I've looked, if you actually read, the sites I found all give different information. I know there were twinking forums and stuff but couldn't remember their names. Someone else gave it to me, glad you could repond with 0 help.
---
Lol k
---
If you’re using damage to hold threat as a warrior you’re gonna have a bad time unless your group is literal dogshit dps
---
Huh didn't know you could do that. Good to know.
---
You know you can premeditate kills and therefore prepare poisons accordingly, right?
---
r/woosh
---
I saw a lone druid doing Free from the Hold the other day. It's the long escort from Northwatch hold that ends in Ratchet. As a fellow member of the Horde I cleared as many mobs for him so it was smooth sailing and I watched him and that night elf walk happily toward Ratchet. All of a sudden fuckin Polly the giant level ?? bird shows up and kills them both. Some Horde rogue must have fucked up their quest and inadvertently ruined this poor druids day... I felt so bad for him. Horde ganking Horde in the most troll way ever.
---
Yes, i am wearing a Devilsaur set, but i had that previously before i even started crafting for this guy.
---
You killed the Felwood furbolgs at 46 or is there a lower level spot?
---
I had a low level ask to leach off rep while following as a ghost but I realized all the loot options split the gold so I ditched him lol
---
I just disagree that it was death by 1000 cuts, there were a few large specific changes that "killed" it for me:
---
Dungeon Finder
---
No Talent Tree
---
"Dumbing Down" the difficulty level
---
Selling level ups 
---
The other minor QoL stuff like more mailboxes, showing numbers on health and mana bars, showing cast time, etc just made the game more enjoyable IMO
---
Ravager is mathematically worse on shamans since all you can do is auto attack and stormstrike at 40+, and warriors have 6 or 7 different ways to proc the weapon. Ravager does store windfury procs though, so its always hilarious to spin for about 20 seconds on 4 mobs and then delete a mob after your next regular swing
---
You tried to milk a tauren didn't you?
---
Demo shout definitely gives threat on refresh unless it functions differently than demo roar which would make no sense.  I can tank a whole dungeon with just the demoroar button and never lose agro.
---
Your first paragraph, thats to prevent camping right? So a bunch of 60s cant just stroll into a starting area and camp the noobs? If so, how does that work when a group of alliance players raid UC? Because I remember way back in the day in vanilla (only played for a year and i’m only lvl 12 now so very noob) UC got raided while I was walking there and they oneshot me. According to what you said that shouldnt be possible.
---
Cause i spent the last 2 hours ganking alliance and now I want to fucking level. Goddamn some of the quests take forever to do because there are four 5 man groups doing the same ones you on.
---
In terms of RP vanilla or classic are unbeaten.  Classes are really different and you make real choices.  Have fun but don't expect fast pace.
---
not sure, ive only used it a couple times to make short clips of KSP
---
Yes, it's always been like that and probably not gonna change, but I still don't get why people want to bore themselves to death sitting idle in cities spamming Trade that's only visible in cities, when they could be out playing and using LFG that's visible everywhere.
---
Just in case you've not seen this, here's a link to an awesome reddit post by a warlock named Dive: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives\_drain\_tanking\_guide\_for\_warlock\_leveling\_in/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
In it, he links to his drain tanking guide that I've been following. If you open that up and scroll halfway down, you'll see a chart showing the ranks of drain life compared to wand DPS. Around level 38 to 46, the more valuable filler shifts from wanding to drain life.
---
I'd also take a look at his compendium of macros, which introduced me to some useful macros I hadn't known about before!
---
This is why I support Sylvanas in retail no matter what. Those night elves and the Alliance have it coming.
---
One day Sylvanas said, “If I get aimed shot by a Night Elf hunter from shadow elf one more time, I am going to burn down that tree and all of them inside it!”
---
And here we are.
---
No, i checked every bag very carefully like 10 times, it's not here. I'm going to lose my mind at this point
---
If you're letting people die, why are you even grouping with them? What's the point? Just leave the group or kick them. Letting them die is 100% pointless.
---
This is Classic WoW. 
---
The further you get in the game the more tacked on the quests are. Until you hit around 50 then you have a few more thought out ones.
---
A level 20 one handed sword with +1 agility is better than this for a hunter.
---
The ritual is complete. It is, how it was forseen a thousand lifetimes ago.
---
No, Angwe had two characters on opposite factions and nothing happened, and I'm sure a lot of salty players reported him.
---
I think the fact that you can look up all the fights online is going to remove most of the difficulty.
---
You all do know that Defensive Stance has 130% base Threat and Battle and Berserker stances only have 80%, right? With 3/5 Defiance you have the same threat as a Bear Tank (145%) and 5/5 Defiance you have more threat.
---
Looking at the Threat values for Warriors, Revenge has a massive 355 threat value, followed by Sunder Armor at 260 and Shield Slam at 250.
---
For AoE tanking, Thunderclap really doesn't cut it. The Threat values at top rank is 180, but it can only be done in Battle Stance, giving it only 80% of that threat, or 144 per mob. You'd be better off Battle Shouting in Defensive since Battle Shout does 70 base * 1.3 for defensive stance then times the number of players buffed. If you catch all 5 members of your party with Battle Shout, you're netting a smooth 455 Threat per Mob (although I'm not sure if there are other formulas as work with proximity threat. It's the same reason why a Regrowth and Rejuv helps Bear Tanks get healing threat before pulling.
---
Is he trying to be 50 DKP minus guy or something?
---
I was running by them to do the quest for the spiders crocs and lions and I accidentally pulled 2 and got the whelp lmao.
---
Which is funny because years ago i spent like 18 hours farming them and it never dropped.
---
And rep
---
It's nice to see actual new players to the game that never experienced Vanilla...let alone WoW.
---
Retail leads you by the hand way to much to the point that it makes the experience of discovery watered down and pointless.
---
Ya I think that’s my main point. I’ve quested until here just watching LFM full or people grinding. But this level is just awkward
---
go back to retail and you'll get real angry
---
That's up to you, I'm not saying you shouldn't use Trade at all, just that LFG is more convenient.
---
I just hit 31, so I'm paying much more attention.
---
So do you think wow classic would be improved by adding a MOP style skill tree?  I hear what you're trying to say but, man, I lived it.  MoP was my last forre into retail, and it was for a log of other people too. The choices Blizzard took away in MoP caused a lot of people to quit and the gameplay choices they made forever alienated their core player constituency from retail -- for which they have recovered by introducing the old system (yay classic).
---
IDK but if you think retail feels better than classic by all means enjoy, I on the other hand will stick with good WoW for many years to come.
---
Lol. No offense, you are exactly the problem with the world of warcraft. You have 0 clue about anything. You spread your falicies all over the internet. Blizzard listens to the loud idiots and we end up with BFA, LFR, Tokens, LFD ect.
---
I killed Cthun in vanilla, LITERALLY the least killed boss in all of wow. I mained holy pally for years in a top 50 guild a top 250 guild in wod/legion, I think I understand a little about healing. Ik playing hunter this time around for a change of pace. I did everything I wanted to do as a healer in vanilla.
---
Go look up ANY video on classic/vanilla tank. PLEASE! ANY VIDEO! THE USE OF CAPS IS ONLY SO THAT MAYBE THERE IS AN OFF CHANCE YOU MIGHT READ MORE THAN 2 WORDS OF THIS RESPONSE.
---
Your take on this issue is so far off base it is ridiculous.
---
You might trouble playing the game if you’re blind, just saying.
---
Swamp of Sorrows is 100% a horde zone.
---
I think any new content, including old expansions, should be on different servers. I'd like 1.12(1.13) to be a thing until WoW goes away.
---
You rock.
---
I did the last 5k Rep without Exp as I was 60 - not sure what my Exp/h was, I wasn't always trying to be super efficient, maybe about 30k/h
---
Go to Wowhead or Joanna’s Guides to get all the info on talent builds and tips for your class.
---
I mean sure, but outages are to be expected when you pay for an online service (and I’m sure this is mentioned in the TOS/EULA/wherever the fine print is).
---
I understand this, butt his is my first time in classic wow. I'm sorry this is ubiquitous
---
Haha found this out last week randomly. Have a macro for it too
---
Interface -&gt; Action Bars -&gt; Check "Bottom Left" and "Bottom Right"
---
You'll also have to set up the keybindings for them, I don't think there are any by default
---
Then they should switch back over to retail
---
I didn't realized people do that. Probably because I've been using a bank alt forever. The first thing I did after reaching level 10 this time in classic was to log out, level my bank alt to 5 and send him to Iron Forge.
---
As someone who just got into an entry administrative position where I basically stare at a screen for 8 hours, coming home and not being able to stand the sight of my PC screen was not an option.
---
I had this argument with my bro. I undercut on somthing and he said "you are losing out on gold" I told him that any amount of gold I get from it is free and new gold to me cause I just randomly looted this while I was playing the game and enjoying myself. If I had worked for it and it wasnt that enjoyable, sure I would want my money's worth. But since I am enjoying the grind I'm happy to just sell it to someone that will either use it or even resell it for more. Idc either way I got my gold
---
Your 2H tank may not be stance dancing well. The increased dmg from zerker and decreased dmg from Dstance make a noticeable difference. Though if you've got a solid 5 man. I'd expect they would run 4 dps for lower level dungeons anyways simply because it's faster and more xp. Assuming that's why you're there.
---
Imp rend isn't great but without it you cant get deep wounds or impale which are pretty good especially when paired with Imp Overpower.
---
Overall, the difference between leaving as Arms over Fury is negligible at best. I do it for two main reasons really: first, Intercept without (at least) 2/5 Tactical is super frustrating and will leave you vulnerable in PvP and second, I don't want to bother with respecing at 40 for MS. Sweeping strikes and 55%+ crit chance with overpower are just icing on the cake.
---
You might have accidentally flagged yourself, like by buffing someone who was flagged.
---
terrifying, like something out of a medieval painting of hell's punishment
---
The only thing I really disagree on in this is heirlooms
---
We fucking EARNED that shit back when they first came out, they were not easy to get and you had to choose wisely.  I had hundreds of /played days and did my time in the grind so it was nice to make alting a little easier... But yes then they ruined that too by making it just cost little bit of gold to get decked out in heirlooms.
---
You are going in blind - you need to know nothing. Learn it &amp; enjoy it!
---
I use a Logitech trackball mouse and luckily have a square top armrest on the couch.
---
As a warrior, its gonna be kind of a bitch to level. I would group up whenever you can. When you hit lvl 60, you're gonna kick ass. Good luck bro!!
---
That's a fun way of saying "there are only two possible ways in, so it might as well be walled in."
---
More like how to stop finding groups.
---
If there's one thing I'm loving about classic, it's the implication that if you're an asshole, people will just stop grouping with you. It's very cathartic. Had a warlock roll need on an agi/str dagger when the rest of the group who actually could use it rolled greed since eh whatever it'd be for offspec. Group immediately booted him out and were all like "alright, that's one less tank and healer on this server who will group with him."
---
Actions have consequences and I love it.
---
So your last point is what I am talking about. I don't want to see this philosophy carried into endgame content. People need to learn and practice their roles. Dps should not be pulling threat and reinforcing bad habits
---
Proof is logs or pictures showing before and after. Put up or shut up. If you’re going to claim that agility increases magic damage, *you* need to show that proof. We don’t need to prove your baseless assumption wrong.
---
Pretty much every modern image processor will take a clipboard image including reddit

Just because the PCs are level 3, doesn't mean that the NPCs are.
---
What makes priest so awesome? Would I like it if I’m not that into healing?
---
this is really the best advice you can give on a free market platform. Your always going to find people who need gold NOW! People are desperate when they're poor and fortunately if you have the capital to invest, you can make a bunch of gold right now by doing very little work
---
Kick em and bring new ones. Dps are dime dozen
---
Have you ever healed a dungeon before? Because low dps is rarely a problem. It’s the high dps pulling aggro that causes problems
---
I just don't visit the site, that's my security measure #1
---
The rest I won't post on a public forum
---
By the way, do you have pets, like rodents? What was your mothers maiden name?
---
I, without fail, set guidelines at the beginning of each run. I basically have a rule that if it doesn’t have a Sunder on it, don’t attack it.
---
Shit! Like it or not this is canon!
---
I miss the collection books and achievements.. other than that, retail has nothing on classic for me.
---
ROFLMAO!  
---
(Do dooo da doo dit)
---
This is disgusting.
---
They drop Turtle Meat, which is used in cooking. Also, greys for vendoring. Honestly, farming them isn't very different than farming any other mob, but I enjoy them because they are neutral (no worries about pulling adds) and appear in good numbers.
---
Also, for the memes.
---
Multiboxxer
---
Most raids will bring a single shadow priest. Your statement is rather misleading. Raids in general do not take "at least" one in anything other than the most technical of senses. Most raids will bring a single Shadow priest, and often they will be PI/Shadow and off heal. Shadow DPS just cannot compare to the others.
---
Let’s make our own group. Druid tank, druid healer, druid dps, druid dps, druid dps.  
---
But while we are at it, let’s face the fact that we are no pure class. Fk em, we can do better! Rotate the healer and bear with every pull and do additional rotation with healer and dps if the healer hits oom. No downtime, it’s druid time!
---
A warlock's contribution to the instance group should be so much more than just stressing out the healer.  If that is not the case, just let them die until they stop playing poorly.
---
I would make it a point to hug him if I got the debuff.
---

---
I say the books are fair game. They are sold by one specific vendor, located in areas people may not visit otherwise. While a 2g cut seems a bit much considering the current state of the economy, there is a very clear value in buying them at the AH opposed to the vendor.
---
What realm and character if you don't mind me asking?
---
Huh. Never noticed the mountain scape through the portal.
---
Tab target and demo shout works well.
---
You can peek down to check keyboard but if you don't have a good feel for where your keys are it could be hard. An MMO mouse would help cause you could have like 12 keys bound to mouse. It works for me so far though without a MMO mouse.
---
Questie is good.  It's not that I haven't done most of them--I played a lot back then--it's more I never really knew what to do next or what was available.  Questie let's you sort of plan what to pick up or not, where to move to next, and so on.  I'm not a big fan of quest hubs the way they've become in retail WoW, but classic Wow def could use a little more refined organization in that department.
---
OmniCC didn't work with ZPerl for me, but works fine with Luna. Might be a problem with interference from another addon.
---
I've been a proponent for updated armor textures in wow for years.  We got those snazzy new character models in WoD, but the armor textures on basically everything is so outdated that all the gear has the same general appearance.
---
I still believe thats a thing we should get.  FFXIV has done it spectactularly, as have other more 'modern' MMO's.  However I was surprised as how little I cared about my characters bodily appearance.  I liked my udpated models in retail when I last played (early Legion), but its not such a big deal to me that I'm made of a few polygons again.  99% of my character is going to be wearing outdated textures regardless of the version I play..
---
I have noticed a few things, actually:
---
Like, sometimes when I switch to drain soul at the last second before a mob dies, I'll get an error message saying the target is dead. Even though the mob is still targeted and seems to have a fraction of health left. This only lasts for a split second though, before it visibly dies for me. But I'm wondering if that could be caused by the relatively high ping I have.
---
And sometimes it does seem like there is a bit of a delay with my spells. I don't know if that's just my imagination though, or if it is due to the ping.
---
And yeah, it's hard to test it on DD, because without leveling up, I don't have all of the spells in my rotation to get a good feel for it (e.g., no drain soul).
---
Granted, my ping is even higher than yours though! And if I were to switch, I'd be going down to only a bit under what you're experiencing now.
---
It's a hard decision for sure. The Grob community is great, and because it's a larger server, you have more opportunity to PvP, get groups, etc. -- while also having the RP-PVP status. Plus, when I have gone onto DD to check it out, I've noticed a higher percentage of non-RP names than on Grob.
---
Oh you could fuck me up there. I assume barrens is to far in to horde t to even remotely give a shit. I walked around stv for the first time this morning though. I wouldn't stop moving my camera in circles go make sure no one was around. Also my  Hunter tracker has become in huge advantage that I never considered before pvp on a classic server.
---
Go at your own pace and have fun!
---
That's true but there was a long time in classic where DPS gain from AP was not normalized on instant attacks yet. So slow weapons would also get way more out of the AP on instants, which made barman shanker an insane wep. Slow weapons are still better for instants of course, but not as much as in early wow patches.
---
I’m mostly concerned that people will struggle trying to get the IPv6 version to work because they aren’t from one of the regions you mentioned, when a quick IPv6 test could eliminate the option quickly 
---
Last I checked, approx 25% of the US still has not IPv6 broadband capabilities.
---
Also, search for local government auctions. Stuff like office equipment such as chairs and desks often get auctioned off for tens of dollars. I bought 15 dual core laptops for $180.
---
My undead mage will finally look good dancing
---
Yes this is true! Makes up for the brutal leveling process :)
---
I mean this is as true as it can be, we're still speed farming dungeons and smashing content that we would consider very hard 15 years ago, but all things considered our restraint as a community has been pretty impressive. Let's see how long it lasts
---
Haha, you caught me
---
In WotLK there were those dailies that were all one big dick joke:
---
"Polishing the Helm"
---
"Thrusting Hodir's Spear"
---
"Blowing Hodir's Horn"
---
I can't imagine leveling a warrior without a farming toon active to support him. Oof
---
I guess il look further into it and see if there are settings. My current default one isnt showing up damage taken but that could be due to some addons
---
Because it causes a disconnect amongst the community therefore destroying the social aspect of an MMOrpg.
---
Yes this is an unpopular opinion
---
hahah, far be it from me to complain on the free upgrade, indeed MS all but pushed me to it.
---
If i'm going to complain about Windows 10 as a whole, then that does not deserve a place in this sub, for those complaints are lengthly and could spawn a new Stephen King novel.
---
Hey listen. Maybe MS might extend Windows 10 "free" indefinitely, and make their revenue off of other areas. Totally in the realm of possibility.
---
Out of all the big tech giants around, overall out of the various sins of Big Tech, good ol' MS is *mostly* in the clear, in my books. Outside of bad Microsoft updates.
---
My relationship with MS is love/hate. More love than hate, to be clear.
---
&gt;Do you really enjoy looking through a spammed chat log
---
Yes. I prefer to actually look for people.
---
Why are people so obsessed with claiming realm first this or that, no one gives a shit about "realm first" loot, especially on re-released games.
---
Until the SM/ZF meta grinding started. Waiting patiently for another week or two when most of the jokerd mage wannabees and rav warriors will go through and we can go back to LF 3 DPS 1 tank 1 healer (insert dungeon here).
---
Oh and also my immersion was ruined upon finding out the dog trainers in SM don't have increased stealth detect.
---
Purists who think any quality of life changes are bad. Idiots are what they are
---
Don't buy gear from vendors!
---
Midwest - Google Fiber - 50ms to West Coast servers for more reference.

---
I would agree within the server. If you are an idiot and act like one, it deserves to be known by your local peers.
---
Money = gear for BoEs, which is something you appear to not be able to comprehend.  But sure, add an ad hominem attack to strengthen your position.  Oh wait....
---
Go back to retail if you want a LFG tool.
---
I had kinda same thing happen to me back in vanilla retail.    I was farm in ashara when blue dragon spawned.    I got a raid going with 25 toons.   So we needed more and invited a small guild to join.   I was kicked by that other guild mid fight because there was two hunters in raid,  myself and another. ( sinew I assume.  To there surprise all 39 others could not loot the epics but I could while not in raid.  Looted that shit right it front of them and they where pissed.   GM contacted me and I told him and he took my side and told them game is working as intended and you should of not kicked players mid fight to secure loot for yourselfs.   Good times and fuck those turds that do shit like this.
---
I'm getting better, still freaks me out a bit. I've just reached level 18, which I consider a decent level for deadmines but I'm almost terrified to accept people's LFG offers in chat or even to call my own group. If I don't get over it I'd be as well going back to hiding dungeonless in retail. Not sure how this will play out for me.
---
He’s also literally making the idiot feel important by making this post. Shit post/10 meme
---
But why would I use Berserker stance in situations where I could get hit? In solo, 3% crit chances is not worth 10% more damage taken.
---
Shouts generate really good threat in Classic. More so than private servers. (Be careful what guides youre looking at) At 4 or more targets you kinda just wanna spam demo. Assuming your dps arent playing lile its retail you should hold aggro just fine if you get a couple shouts off before they start going ham. They generate more threat the more targets your shouts effect. Which is also the case with Battle shout. Keep in mind battle only has a 20 yrd range so it probably wont hit your casters or hunters in the back. At 2-3 targets you should still be tab sundering/mauling. Something Ive seen a lot in Classic are warriors over estimating the amount of threat thunder clap does. Theres no threat modifiers on it, even more so because youre not in defensive when you use it. TC is really just for the attack speed debuff which isnt that big a deal. Hope this helps.
---
i wonder if that dude that i ninjad the chest from after he pulled the mobs away has me on a list...
---
It will it did to me, because its hard to justify spending 18 hours of my day in front of a screen be it work or games
---
HS is almost a 50% damage increase per swing. This guy's post is just wrong.

According to [Icy-Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/45572-most-popular-classes-in-wow-classic-2/), they're the 3rd most popular class, after Warriors and Mages.
---
I wanted to roll rogue but i thought that everybody will be playing rogue, and it seemed that druid would be the least popular so i decided to roll a tauren druid. I do see a lot of druids so maybe other players had the same thought process that i had.

Ask in chat in a major city.  Specifically request you’re looking for a large social/casual guild,  it shouldn’t take you long to find out if they are a good fit for you.

You are a mage, yo should not expect mercy

Downloading an addon that automatically ignores anyone who links a thunderfury in chat is the best thing that I’ve ever installed.

A level 6 mage walked up to me in ironforge today and asked to borrow 30 copper, so I gave her 5 silver, be the change you want to see in Azeroth.
---
Questing is for the horde only, scrub.
---
I totally agree that most pugs are a mess, but I'd argue that those groups actually would benefit more from a 2H tank than a well organized group. It's actually the reason I started 2H tanking. I was fed up with charging in, missing, getting parried, no rage for sunders, dps unload, and now I've got nothing hitting me and mobs running all over the place.
---
If I can put out more dps, hold more threat, and drop more mobs with a 2H then why wouldn't I? Why care about the hunter pet taunting mobs? I'll just Cleave them in the back. Mage spamming arcane explosion? Cool, I'll just continue sweeping strikes and WW. You will never beat a mage 2 levels higher than you throwing down blizzard, nova, cone, arcane explosion. Doesn't matter if you've got 1hander and shield or a ravager. Their burst is too wild. So who cares, just clear the dungeon and get your loot. They know how to ice block. I have yet to have a healer complain to me simply because most groups I've been in everything has died quickly.

HS is almost 50% damage increase per swing. The OP is just plain wrong.

The Saxon Tales by Bernard Cornwell. And once you finish the books, you can enjoy The Last Kingdom TV series based off the books (currently filming season 4).

lmao !

My man!
---
Alright, rolling Dwarf Rogue then. 
---
Thanks for the insight!
---
Who is claiming these raids are so good?  I would say Naxx and BT and Ulduar are their best.  I did some LFG 'raiding' in MoP and it was terrible, no one said anything, it was like a funeral parlor.
---
They spank it; they tank it. 
---
Let them die a few times, it should slow them down.
---
WoW, StarCraft, Diablo. They all use the same style of hand painted textures. The blending of colors creates some really vibrant environments, and it's obviously easier to recreate concepts quickly in that style versus sticking to the realism of original designs.
---
"imp sap rogue LFG UBRS" was a thing back in vanilla.
---
You have 3 "weapon slots". Main hand, Off hand, Ranged. As a caster, you can use a main hand and offhand or a two-hander (staff). You put a wand in the ranged slot.  
---
You almost never, ever, use your staff or weapons for melee attacking as a caster. You use them for stats.  
---
Speaking as a warlock, early game you want to dot them up then wand. Here is why... You cast immolate, corruption, and possibly curse of agony. What are your choices then? You can cast shadowbolt, but it's really mana inefficient for the damage it does. You could melee attack, but that seems like a bad idea. So, you wand. It's really good dps, and allows you to start regaining mana earlier since you start regening mana 5 seconds after your last cast, and "Shoot" with wand isn't a spell you cast.  
---
Like I said also, wands are really good dps early on and do more damage than a lot of spells at that level, and are probably dirt cheap in the AH by this point.  
---
As far as tracking DoTs, most people use addons to assist. I suggest OmniCC and ClassicAuraDuration to get a CD number on them, then something like NeatPlates to track them on Nameplates if you want that. NugRunning is also good for tracking dots and all on multiple targets. Plenty of options, so you can't go wrong.
---
What does that mean? :)
---
Sagefish Delight is 6 mp5, easily fished, and only 175 cooking to make. It's only a greater sagefish and hot spices, I think. Lasts for 15 minutes.

---
It's why the final fantasies get dated hard. I can never fully commit to a replay
---
It's just part of it, I suppose.  It's part of what Venendi sacrificed when they sold their company.  After that the path that was taken included more accessibility to get more subs, it ended up hurting the game in the long run.  Just my opinion though.
---
it's literally reality sorry reality may be so "harsh". I just don't see why people are so worried about stuff they almost can't control at all. Blizzard will most likely not post pop stats for awhile so you going to sit here and stare at your screen thinking "omg what if horde or alliance has a few more players than the other!". Or you know.... you could just play the game. 
---
But hey.... common sense is tough I know so down vote me and hit me with the sarcasm. But you know I am right so what we even talking about?
---
Nah, it's good that you didn't get screwed, but still, the old loot system was terrible. Guilds and parties abuse it constantly at the expense of others play time.
---
Personal loot in retail is a vast improvement and only reason people cry about it is because people hate change. If personal loot was used back in classic everyone would have praised it as innovative and refuse to use anything else.
---
Narrator: *It wasn't.*
---
So the argument started about tanks apparently taking too much damage, thus causing you to have to drink more. I offered the solution, which has nothing to do with what type of healer you are or how it works. Simply drink WHILE they pull. Again, no one takes damage at the start of a pull. How does this matter what class you are. For the record I've healed on all the healing classes. You know what, it doesnt matter. I bet you will be yelling at people to click the light well soon enough. Yet again I'm wasting my breath on reddit.
---
Man I play since TBC and didn’t know that.
---
I'm on Sulfuras as well and it has felt Horde-Dominated in the low 30s zones. Thousand Needles/Shimmering Flats is probably 3:1 Horde. STV feels even in the north near Nesingwary, then horde dominated anywhere south of that. Arathi just felt empty period.
---
I've seen loads of whining about being outnumbered in general chat, people keep claiming their addons are estimating a 4-6K population difference which seems absurdly large to me.
---
I feel as an undead rogue I must lick people while stealthing past them. Or giving out a emoted laugh so people know I’m there. But what even more fun is coming out of stealth to grab some swiftthisle or fadeleaf. Then immediately back in weirdo stealth mode.
---
People are trying to AOE the groups down and it doesn't really work that way. If the group is purpose built for it, maybe, but not PUGs.
---
Large pulls should involve CC to minimize incoming damage. DPS should be using single target abilities only, in most cases, and focusing on the primary target.
---
why does his raid have 20 mages? no way thats normal lol
---
I think rogues are kinda frustrating to play in classic.  They're so completely and utterly reliant on cooldowns.
---
I am a patient person, but I don't have time to spend 30 mins out of my 1 hour looking for a group :(
---
Yeah I'm beating those but it runs like ass.
---
I feel like it's a mess right now.  There are so many people spamming general, trade, lfg and world that it's virtually impossible to find a group unless you are quickly reading everything.
---
I need to learn how to write addons, so I can find one that'll highlight keywords in chat.
---
I have a full time job and I'm married. I get it. Most of the people I play with not only have full time jobs and are married but also have children.
---
There's nothing that says you can't play Classic when you want and play BFA when you want to drop in and play for a little while.  
---
Classic isn't going to go anywhere while you can't play it. Join a large guild that hopefully has a bunch of people at many levels. Play BFA when you only have a short time to play, and when you get a solid couple of hours to play, fire up Classic and find a group for a dungeon. The key with Classic is never to be doing just one thing. If you're sitting in Stormwind spamming trade for a group and that's it, you're doing it wrong. You can play the auction house, work on tradeskills or run around looking for all those weird little side quests you miss out on in the main city. If you can't find a group, head out to try and do a quest you've had sitting around. There are bound to be some green quests you've gone past. There's so much to do, and so many ways to entertain yourself in Classic without no-lifing 24/7.  
---
BFA conditions people to go focus on one thing right this minute. Join a queue, run dungeons, then do something else, then log out because you've done everything you had to accomplish that day. You reached the end of today's scripted ride. That's not how Classic works. It's up to you to decide how you want to play and you can spend as much or as little of your time doing it and still have fun.
---
Learn something new every day
---
thanks!
---
Max queue I saw was on opening weekend at around 12k it's never been above 6k for me since. I would say the queues start around 7pm central or eastern time. I think it's a west coast server I'm not sure. I think I'm 2 hours ahead of server time.
---
Yes, It's a team effort. We join hands sing songs and level, He expects me to tank for him. I expect food. That's the middle ground. I'm still gonna die faster than him seeing as i need to die in order for mobs to get to him + he has nova/blink.
---
You learn the skill forever. All 5 people can benefit from it in a dungeon. How is it my responsibility to pay for his skills?
---
If that's your argument i demand he pays for me to learn taunt.
---
And OP is clearly in a similar spot.
---
That's a fair comment really. Personally I'm a huge tpb fan and it doesn't appear too low effort, so it get the thumbs up from me.
---
Edit: too
---
Who am I kidding :')
---
Fug
---
I’m off all next week on vacation. So it’ll be all good screen for me!
---
The druids level would display as ?? As well
---
Yeah, I remember that was when they started dropping epics in 5-mans towards the end so that people could catch up on gear
---
yes. 40
---
I dunno man I’ve been in a few melee cleave groups as a warrior and it’s faster leveling through dungeons than questing. 
---
I don’t like doing it but I did it to avoid questing in hillsbrad and STV as I would be a walking punching bag. I started STV at level 38 and I had an easier time as most other players wouldn’t engage as they were lvl 32-33.
---
I cannot believe you! How could you do such a thing!
---
Learn something new every day.
---
I'm pretty sure it's just the caster spells that don't auto upgrade, because there is a reason (less mana cost) to use lower ranks. There's really no reason to ever want to use Sinister Strike lvl 1 again once you get lvl 2.
---
Allowed
---
Sounds like someone wants me to get on my mount instead of aspect of the pack
---
What he needs is a helm. Bashes straight to the head aren't good for anyone.
---
Here's a census from my server. https://i.redd.it/ludape5n9kl31.png  
---
Most people are between 20 and 40 now.
---
True but that's now how they see it. The new meta is to be overlevelled and to aoe spam a dungeon and rush it in like 20 mins
---
When the queue is too long...
---
"it's not a stereotype if it's TRUE!"
---
I got the herod helm last night. It's amazing.
---
Most of the time I log in when I get home just incase but I havent run into a queue for about a week. But my bros see them later in the night around 3-4k ish
---
Ret is great for pvp... was in vanilla to... what ret is bad for is raiding.
---
I think you downloaded the retail version. Make sure you download the classic compatible version.
---
well... uldaman wants to talk with you
---
=)
---
So 7pm you have a 6k que? That’s way worse than I have now..
---
This bro lifts.
---
This be gold
---
Classicwow.live shown me a lot of love. About 3 hours a level around 30-40
---
And it’s disguised as normal conjured water so they can’t tell you just poisoned them XD
---
I'm a simple horde player.  I see Alliance. I smash.
---
Welcome to pvp
---
I think they means bulky electronics like laptops, and not just on a plane in general but during turbulence. They may fly out of your seat and smack someone in the face.
---
You are “allowed” to use them due to popular demand and the low risk. But when turbulence is this bad.... you should use better judgement
---
Thanks for the info! I'm going to try it on my warrior alt
---
I’m going to laugh my ass off when these god damn horde have 3+ hour queue times when I get instant.
---
They had them, but they were dog slow compared to a good desktop, and desktops weren't all that fast either. Like, we're probably talking about the original Pentium M or older, and the 2.5" hard drives of the day were painfully sluggish.
---
Say stupid shit, win stupid prizes.
---
This. Level 19 blues of all types will be worth more when Battlegrounds are available and people have gold to throw around.
---
This was such a big help. Thank you for taking time to help me understand. I appreciate you!
---
If a world drop of significant value happens, and can potentially be sold by anyone in the group to help get something they really want, why should one player have the right to take that from everybody else because they'd equip it?
---
I think there are many groups that would be happy to pass on a big drop for someone who wants it to equip, but I'll defend the right of all players in the group having a shot to decide what to do with it with a roll.
---
It's situational, and no, I don't think advocating fair distribution of items will lead to everyone poorly geared and sitting on piles of gold.
---
Underwater breathing is a buff.
---
That's not a very accurate recreation???
---
Hahah. It helps if you’re the party leader!
---
So your issue is that the PvP servers are too full of people who don't *really* want to be there and that's slowing everything down?
---
I'm sorry, but that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. People want to PvP, but not every minute in-game has to be spent hunting the opposing faction. I love PvP at max level, I just want to get through the leveling phase, and If I have to cooperate with people to do that I will. Sorry I guess? Maybe I didn't get your point.
---
And I don't know how far you've gotten, but I've taken it pretty slow and I have no issues leveling. I barely have to compete with people because I just group up with them instead. And that's on a full server.
---
Sounds kinky

Had fun during the shitshow of a launch, can't wait till they turn off layering and be apart of that shitshow.

Farming sparkles from Whelps in Swamp of Sorrows for 1KNeedles quest.  There are 5 horde mages all in their 40s, I'm 35.  I get hit w/ a frost bolt and I seek The Rake on him.  He's casting FB w/ a 1.2 attack speed pet hitting him and me weaving all my shots.  He was dead and I didn't lose 20% hp.  The other 4 mages pushed my shit in immediately after.  Pricks...
---
You went from Charlie Brown to Schwarzenegger
---
The thing about +healing is that it is invaluable for downranking (if you aren't aware, you absolutely do not cast the highest rank of your spells in raids, since it will oom you immediately - you cast a lower rank instead). The idea is that because the heal increase is a flat number, not a percentage or something, it becomes a massive benefit to lower ranked spells.
---
It is just difficult to get an ilvl score with pre raid bis is all.  They'll still inspect gear to make sure you're trying .
---
&gt;I was fueled by mountain dew, microwave michalinas, and god damn warheads
---
&gt;he was wild
---
Boy do we sure have different perspectives on what "wild" means in this context
---
Thank you.
---
The threat generation is the main deal. Low damage from a 1-h can keep a tank from generating enough threat. Doing big cries with a slow 2-h will get you more threat unless your 1-h is a really good blue or purple.
---
AFAIK there have been any "nerfs" to speak of. They are in classic as they were in patch 1.12.
---
With that logic they should have never given you enough points to go into a 2nd tree, let alone get the 10-point ability of that tier. 
---
You would still be missing half of the 2nd tree so I hardly call that "best of both worlds"
---
Probably helped that you had basically no competition. Those of us in the 30s will never be able to AoE farm for months at least on my server. Every spot has 5+ mages.
---
STV is a no go area as alliance on incendius
---
You dont have shadow form yet so you are missing out on 15% damage. Just wait until 40 and you will bump up real fast. Dont listen to the people saying spriests cant do good dps. They cant do aoe dps or super long dps because of mana problems but after 40 in single target fights you should do fine
---
So, do you need more than one computer to multibox? I can't imagine running 5 virtual machines on the same computer and still having the power to run WoW on all of them.
---
Need more information. What spec are you running for leveling? Are you doing anything besides DoTing? Are you wanding? Lifetapping when the healer is good on mana to squeeze out more damage?  
---
At that level, you should be one of the top damage dealers single target just by Doting them up and spamming shadowbolt if you have average gear.  
---
AoE for more than 5-6 mobs at that level, you should ignore doting all together (usually, but you can pre-dot sometimes) unless you dot up a boss or elite real fast. Then you should just be Rain of Fire or Hellfire once the tank gets enough agro.
---
Why even bother with a bear tank? With starfire, entangling roots,  and cats from 5 of us, how long will they last?
---
Unless we end up inside, of course.
---
He was overreacting but don't need roll on stuff you can't use. Lot of things are gonna be bind on pickup too, so no point.
---
This is relatable.
---
I would love to hang out with your group in voice chat! I'm quiet, relaxed, and funny. Very welcome to everyone.
---
absent mindedness really is to blame
---
I’d just post the same pic next month, titled “When you have to cut your cable to pay off your phone bill.”
---
As a drop its rare but its so easy to just give 6 cloth to a tailor and have him make a bag for you. I had four 6 slots in like an hour or so of playing
---
There are bad apples everywhere but on the whole I've had better (quantity and quality) social experiences in like, two weeks of Classic than the last two expansions combined.
---
Neat
---
Did not know that! Thank you
---
No as in, you literally are unable to trade BoP blue items if you roll need. Even if you had won that first roll, you couldn't have traded the item to your friend.
---
I'm talkin' arenas baby!
---
So I tried what you suggested to no avail. Is there any other work around you can think of? Maybe Atlasloot is not compatible with Mac on classic?
---
Made my day
---
I’ve tanked about a dozen dungeon runs up to level 31 and have had zero issues using a 2H for 95% of the time. All pugs. 
---
I sometimes swap to shield to interrupt a cast or ill swap to a shield if someone asspulls an extra pack of mobs. 
---
The extra threat you get from a 2-hander is insane. Especially the initial threat. 10-15% more threat AND 10-15% more rage means about like 30-45% more threat. 
---
Maybe at higher levels getting crit is a bigger problem, but I’ve never ever died in rfc, wc, bfd, sfk or rfk except when my healer is dead or oom. 
---
More damage and more threat means that mobs die faster which means they do less damage. If your tanks are getting spiked down then they must be absolutely horribly underleveled in white gear or something. 
---
The number one issue players talk about on this sub wrt tanking is that the dps rip threat from them on targets. While sure, dps should hit marked targets and blah blah blah, I just don’t have any of those issues. I can establish aggro on 3 or 4 mobs pretty easily though I often have to use taunt to pick one back up early in the pull, and it likely has to do with using a 2 hander that helps me generate way more threat.
---
Yeah it only really happened near launch day. I haven't had too many people really leaving, at least not without saying something first. The classic experience has been pretty G over all.
---
Possibly? That might have been it, I unfortunately dont recall the exact name
---
Don't forget to jump in the wheel to reset mobs in Deadmines. It's saved me a couple times.
---
I probably started attacking one of the raiders lol. I was like 10 years old and had no idea what was happening
---
Its his guild and his raid?
---
please tell me how you're [GPU](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-NVS-3100M-vs-Nvidia-GeForce-8800-GT/m7837vsm7722) is better than the minimum!!!
---
I think realm first 60, realm first down of a raid boss, etc. are all pretty cool achievements and I’m only a level 34 scrub.
---
I don’t have the time to dedicate to competing at any of this but the competition is intriguing.
---
Just to clarify (as you said you were a new player):
---
All classes have a main hand slot, off-hand slot, and a ranged slot.
---
Every class can equip a weapon in their main hand. If it's a two-hander, obviously it occupies both hands. For melee classes, this is likely a sword, axe, etc. that they, you know, hit the bad guy with. For casters, this is likely a stave, or perhaps a one-handed sword or dagger and an offhand item, that provides them with stats, but doesn't really see any use in combat.
---
The ranged slot is, in almost every case, a ranged weapon of some variety (surprise surprise). For Hunters, this will be their primary weapon, but even warriors or rogues can equip guns, bows, throwing weapons, etc. to provide some additional stats and the ability to pull a mob from range. For casters, this slot will be occupied by a wand. Notably, for Paladins and Shaman, this slot cannot hold a ranged weapon, instead it holds a Libram or Totem, respectively.
---
As a Warlock, you want a wand in your ranged slot, and you want to make sure you keep that weapon skill levelled up. You certainly *can* keep staves/swords/daggers levelled up if you want to, but in any case where you're auto-attacking, you should be using your wand, not your main-hand weapon, as it will simply do far more damage.
---
Eh, to an extent in my opinion.  The PlayStation era is the era that aged the least gracefully but PS2 on still can and do look relatively good considering the age.  And even then the art direction in VII, VIII, and IX are still very good, they are just severely hampered by the tech of the time compared to modern games.  The SNES era and back obviously have the timelessness that sprite based games did.  Sure the Mode 7 World Map stuff in VI looks quaint but the art style was rock solid and the game olds up exceptionally well.
---
But mostly to put it in perspective Final Fantasy XI is a bit older than WoW and still looks pretty good all things considered.
---
Different for ally than horde I guess, even still there are quests that take you to stromgarde can just pick it up while there, unless your leveling your first aid faster than the rest of your professions which is likely, oh well.
---
It's against the EULA.

This is really quality stuff.  Thanks for taking the time to put it together.
---
how do you caculate that? i'm leveling like.. 3-4 classes at the same time. highest is 30, 2nd highest 23. there's still tons of people in those level ranges in my server at least. i'm taking my sweet ass time.
---
Hunters are sick and good for new players. Easy to learn and hard to master.
---
&gt; If your goal is to make money, then posting for 5s higher than the vendor price is not the way to do it. It just crashes the market and the only one to benefit at that point is the buyer.
---
The nice thing about classic is that there are lots of ways to play. You'll find this in retail too; some people are all about making the most they can from their time on the AH, and the most they can from their drops. Others are looking for a quick turnaround and a guaranteed sell, even if that means they're not squeezing all the silver they can from an item.
---
Not everyone plays the AH the same way, and that's OK.
---
just run up from southshore, it's really close. You might die once or twice getting to Uther's Tomb though
---
Yeah, that'd definitely do it.
---
Steam link, team viewer, there are a number of remote options if you leave your home computer on.
---
Yeah, I hear ya. I’m not new to this grind and have played a few private servers as well as retail for 13+ years. It’s harder as an adult to commit a huge amount of time, so I’m trying to be as efficient as possible.
---
Great tool for some epic pictures
---
On Incendius Everybody is mostly polite until one faction reaches a critical mass and starts slaughtering the other faction
---
People get pretty upset about dungeon rolls, and rightfully so as there can be a lot of competition. Just so you know, most boss loot drops as bind on pickup. This means that you cannot trade it. The etiquette is to roll need if you yourself will use it, greed if not. Rolling need on something to up your friends chances on getting bind on equip is extremely frowned upon. It's totally legitimate that one person can win multiple need rolls, that's just how the RNG system works. Being labeled a ninja looter can earn you a pretty bad reputation on a server, and people who recognize you will likely not invest the time partying with you because they won't want to risk having one less shot at getting the gear they need. Only roll need on gear you yourself will use.
---
Oh no, it was not a boss item. I was able to trade it back to my friend right after I got it.
---
Easiest just to ignore the guy. No use wasting energy getting annoyed at someone when you could just not hear about him at all.
---
theres some good video on youtube about that (how to make gold fishing) and they say the average price.
---
lets just say that stonescale eel are 1g for a stack right now on my server
---
you can expect to sell a stack for 5g. time will tell, but thats my experience on Pservers
---
I'm hating my life leveling a druid however I'm thinking it will better suit my play style so I'm going with it. I didn't level one in vanilla so didn't know what to expect. Just hit 20. Hoping cat form will make the difference.
---
So yeah, YTA with this.
---
First, many items are Bind on Pickup, or BoP, so you wouldn't have even been able to give it to your friend.  
---
Secondly, even if it did work - mob rule over single players to double your chances since you have a friend to coordinate with would still be a dick move. Everyone gets bad rolls sometimes.  Doesn't mean you get to put your hand on the scale.
---
I understand this and chose differently than you would have. I think it's ok.
---
He’s assuming you rolled need on a bop item, which you couldn’t trade to your friend and would have had to vendor.
---
I love how the inside of the world is bright, shiny, and full of hope, while the real world around it is desolate.  Perfect.
---
That kind of shit is the ultimate petty sadboi move.
---
I lived it too buddy, but let's not kid ourselves in thinking they took *away* choices.
---
The pre-MoP talent trees are attractive because they give a sense of a big, interconnected network with a lot of choices, but strictly speaking, they're *more* restrictive, because of all the dependencies and the lack of balance between choices. Again, using Classic Warrior as an example, there's a reason that so many specs dip 11 and/or 17 points into Arms for Anger Management and/or Impale, just like there's a reason every single build which goes into Fury picks up Cruelty, Imp Battle Shout, and Enrage, followed by Death Wish, Flurry, and Bloodthirst if it goes deep enough.
---
The word "cookie cutter" was thrown around for a reason, because talent builds became extremely routine and predetermined. Yeah, you have a little bit of choice of which tree you're going into, but the broad strokes are always predetermined, because that's how they're balanced (e.g. Booming Voice can never compete with Cruelty).

Path of Exile makes for a good comparison - it has a *huge* and expansive tree, but unless you're making the absolute most esoteric builds, you begin to notice that most passive builds spec extremely similar to every other build of its role (e.g. Melee Crit Sword builds pretty much all spec the same way, with very minor deviation). Despite this, people still enjoy it, because it's interactive, and gives off the illusion of choice (you *could* change if you wanted to, even if you rarely ever do, just like you *could* make a Classic Warrior build that specs Sweeping Strikes and Death Wish without ever taking Mortal Strike or Bloodthirst, although you never would).
---
By contrast, the MoP+ trees are looked down upon because they're simplistic, but consider what that simplicity gets you -
---
* No more "+5% whatever" talents, that you're not going to notice anyway.
---
* No "improved Rend" talents that you only take to get to the thing you actually want.
---
* More "keystone" style talents (Sweeping Strikes, Death Wish style things) that provide an immediate impact on your gameplay.
---
* Easier switching, which naturally leads to more experimentation.
---
And you know, it's fine to have a preference one way or another. A lot of video games operate under the illusion of choice, making a player feel like they're in control, even when the experience is near completely on the rails, but let's not pretend that these changes weren't made for very real reasons.
---
MoP changes didn't cause people to quit in droves; the game was already 8 years old at the time, and everything steadily declines in popularity as it gets older, with regular upsurges as it releases new content (which, you know, MoP actually did, and let's not forget it was one of the most successful expansions to date). What those changes *did* was give people who were already on the fence an excuse to leave.
---
&gt; I on the other hand will stick with good WoW
---
And please, for the love of god, if you want to have a serious discussion, stop with this kind of shill. You can like whatever you want to like without the thinly veiled insinuations. They just make you look ignorant.
---
People like this end up quitting by early to mid-40's because it gets hard. At Max, everyone for the most part earned their spot in a party and know their role.
---
Can you list what add-ons you're using? I like those unit frames.
---
GM’s would do this all the time in classic. Also quit giving this guy publicity if you hate him so much. Why do you even watch his shit? Are you that much of a closet fanboy?
---
Why is the festival happening?
---
I doubt they care about exploration exploits in Classic.
---
I do this all the time.
---
Lol, aight cool, thanks man, good stuff.
---
Seconding ShareX here, you can use it to take and upload screenshots, record gifs, quickly edit images, and even upload documents. It's available on the Steam store too for anyone who doesn't want to trust rAnDoM eXeS.
---
First to respond means this is wha
---
t I am gunna try first lol
---
usually it's a tank mindset problem. Focusing 1 mob at a time is going to absolutely nuke your xp/hr. People don't just die the second they aggro a mob. It's not the end of the world, especially if it's for much faster exp/gear which is the ultimate goal anyways for most groups. Get with the times, and aoe those packs down playboi
---
Main DPS classes are: Hunter, Rogue, Warrior, Mage and Warlock.
---
Mages and warlocks don't really need a lot of items, mages rely a lot on burst while warlocks focus on Damage over Time (DoT) spells.
---
Rogues are stealthy and require melee range, they don't have mana so they can always pump out good damage as long as they're alive.
---
Hunters are not as powerful in terms of pure DPS, but they have a pet that can tank for them and they can do a lot of cool things like traps/feign death.
---
Warriors can be the best DPS class in the game, but you will need some of the best equipment to get there. Leveling warriors can be a bit of a pain, but at the end-game content they are the only viable tanks.
---
This is completely situational. If your auto attack is 200 damage (see: whirlwind axe, or any other slow 2h) the damage from HS is a marginal increase. Since it's a flat damage increase, by default it's going to be a higher % increase on a faster, lower damage weapon.
---
Ease up on the efficiency. There's no 'correct', there's what's fun. The game is a journey. If you're not enjoying it now, you likely won't enjoy it at 60. If you just want to raid, then BFA will be way better for you, you can just character boost to max level, get some catchup gear and be raiding in a few days in LookingForRaid. BFA also has clearly optimized routes for your character to develop along.
---
Classic is going to take you a pretty long time to get to raiding and even then, there's a lot of other stuff you need to do to prep for raids.
---
If you're going to keep playing, ditch the guide and try things out for yourself. Buy spells that make sense or look interesting. If you have to spend some time at 40 without a mount it won't kill you. You only get once first time through this game. Don't turn it into a job, you're going to hate it.
---
The addon Titan Panel has a cool feature that tracks your xp per hour.
---
Reminder.
---
Vanilla's talent system is refreshingly complex and allows for a wide variety of playstyles.  IMO adding a 21st point would almost require people to spec 21/31 in some way to get those valuable talents.  Instead there are many off specs that become viable for a variety of classes (look up elementalist mage, Holy/reck paladin, or Heart of the wild druid) that don't utilise 31 point talents but offer very strong playstyles.
---
I actually can't tell if this is a satirical post or not.
---
Every "3 quests" (not sure how the hell you got that number) in retail is a small chapter in a story arc that bridges an entire contitental story together, 
---
No, I don't care about why a random NPC wants pelts. Yes, Im more engaged in how killing a witch in drustvar leads to a large story plot.
---
I don't remember every quest in retail but I remember the story. I don't remember the story in classic but I remember the shit droprate grind quests.
---
Quests in retail are a plot element at this point. That's the point of their linearity. Quests in classic are an attempt to hit you to cap.
---
But yikes feel free to keep wanking off over classic quests if that suits your fancy.
---
Hi, /u/missmelul

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1wwxw/how_is_zandalar_tribe_eu_for_horde_and_alliance/).
---
True, I learned that now.
---
You can always shame the guy in general chat so everyone in the zone knows and may even choose not to group with him
---
This is so far beyond shit talk.
---
How do you only have 2 gold? I have almost 5 at level 20 and all I’ve done is vendor trash?
---
Then don’t stress it. All good moving forward.
---
I mean yeah it's a dick move but if you hate him why are you watching him? this was clipped like 20 seconds ago lol
---
Go straight to Sentinel Hill, Westfall. Begin the quest chain that leads to the Deadmines. Do them while you're level 20-21 - the end boss is a 21 elite, so you're moving past the point where you're getting max XP from it.
---
That same chain has quests for future dungeons as well, so it's important.
---
Hello I'm looking for info on the more complicated parts 😳
---
I thought the AH isn’t layered.  There’s only one accessed by everyone of the server.
---
Cowabungas. My new target. I’ll see you on the field of battle. 
---
Horde 50 rogue Kromcrush
---
I agree. Thanks for elaborating on it, makes it easier to understand it.
---
it's a lot easier and a lot slower as well, important to note.
---
So true. When I started playing in BC I played with a garbage g-card. I ended up upgrading to a mid-range card around my late 30's/early 40's while leveling in Feralas. The first time I logged on with better settings it was raining and I freaked out. It was awesome!
---
Now I have a much better setup and it looks so good! I love the tweaks they made.
---
Oh just fuck off already.
---
Good luck out there
---
Exactly. That’s why it’s so shit atm.
---
Aw man, I was gonna do that.
---
Healing mobs are generally safe to have a DPS face tank while it dies. I wouldn't do it outside of a 5 man instance, and it's preferable that the tank pick it up, but it's not the end of the world when they get stray attacks in.
---
For extra pain try leveleing a priest solo.
---
This is exactly it. It’s up to game designers to understand what makes a game special, giving people what they want will always be suboptimal, and is exactly why the most valuable but boring exploits will always be farmed to death. Limitations are what drives the sprit of the game
---
Or maybe people should grow up and stop acting like assholes.
---
Depressions' pet should be called anxiety
---
Oooohhh just suck a noodle &amp; die
---
by 1.12 money was NOT as hard to make in wow. items are worth more because the stat allocation is less shitty too. we know what's valuable and what isn't. you're missing the fact that this patch was over 1.5 years after wow's launch, it was 6 months from BC.
---
you folks gotta stop being stupid and comparing wow at vanilla launch to classic in patch 1.12. it's miles apart.
---
i mean, did you see the dress he was wearing?
---
I lol’d at E=Mp^5
---
'World of Stalingrad' 'socialist heaven' -- uuuuuuh care to explain how exactly, lmao.
---
Why was this removed? The dude organized a public raid and promised rolls for loot, then acknowledged the 2 highest roll in chat for the Staff of Dominance and refused to give it to both because “he doesn’t deserve it” and instead gave it to someone in his guild while claiming shadow priests and warlocks can’t crit. 
---
Stop following this assclown, this is straight up ninja looting.
---
I’ve found myself a couple times with 2 talent points to spend.
---
You better not be a physical dmg class 😁
---
More like “village idiot”
---
well at least they didn't say they were at band camp
---
Oh yeah, I always forget that that is technically a part of 1k needles.
---
I got my Corpsemaker as I Ding'ed 29 as a Shammy. I rolled a 1. NO ONE ELSE NEEDED IT! I fucking fist pumped so hard boi! I don't know the last time a raid purp in Retail made me that excited. Probably sometime around Mists.
---
I got your back, bro. It’s a learning process!
---
You’ll love it - hunters feel godlike when leveling and in pvp. Look up some guides on how to kite enemies, it’s super satisfying.
---
I'm waiting til L60 to finalize the button layout. I'll prob knock off a row once I have all my abilities and can memorize binds.
---
Are you getting these on curseforge or where are you finding them?  I have run into a lot of addons that are broken.  Classic threat meter is one in particular I can't seem to find one (that works).
---
Also, do you happen to know of a good autoattack timer bar (preferably that also works for wands)?
---
Why not just add them to your ignore list instead of cluttering your friends list with trash and having to look through it each time you group with someone?
---
And it’s time for my annual 1v1 in Civ 3 against the French.
---
It doesn’t take long though. They always surrender at the slightest sign of aggression. Just like in real life.
---
To be fair a lot of tanks dont mark, I mean you should still watch the tank and attack his target even without marks, but marks still help. Even if its just a skull, tanks can even macro that shit to make it super easy..
---
oh okay. i thought it was like that meow meow app from that episode of Community.
---
They are letting overloaded realms dump into one particular new realm.  Not the same as letting people move as they wish.  That ninja everyone knows on your server can't jump servers to get a clean slate.  That felony is stuck with him and his server knows it.  The community stays the same.
---
At least they were both help in the offhand. The 2handed ones are the ones you need to worry about.
---
I play pizza and work at a wow place, I feel this post.
---
Nvm read item level as level req.
---
That's not true because you're limited by rage. You literally have nothing else as good to spend it on.
---
Even at 200 damage its a 25% damage increase, or you can...sunder and get what...a few %?
---
If you're swinging faster and generating more rage, you have more rage to HS which just makes it better until you have an alternative. 
---
HS is always the best rage dump before 36 outside of elites, tanking, or ultra high hp mobs (or hitting OP procs).
---
It was not a BoP Item btw. I was able to give it to my friend immediately after getting it
---
Time is money, friend!
---
They do not. The coefficient is based on the base cast time (pre-talents). The extended duration of swp via talents works the same way.
---
Few places you could consider at 34, STV, shimmering flats, dustwallow, sm grind for a couple levels.
---
Im a tailor so I made silk bags and mageweave gloves and sold them on the AH. But Silk Cloth alone goes for 50s a stack and Mageweave 1-1.5g a stack (On whitemane)
---
They also drop lots of other vendor loot like grey weapons etc.
---
So, here's what I suggest. Go ahead and respec, as it's cheap early on and 4 talent points can help.  
---
Single target boss, after dotting just spam shadowbolt and keep refreshing dots.  
---
&gt; rain of fire does use alot of mana also 
---
So, you'll just need to get used to being low life as a warlock. You will constatly be trading life and mana for each other. Lifetapping is essential to the warlock kit to stay competitive and dark pact helps as well.  
---
I suggest using a dps meter to see how efficient you are being with spells, as it's the best way. Check out how much damage curse of agony is doing in certain situations, was it worth the mana for the damage? Did using RoF do more damage or less damage than a normal pull with Dots? Did you hellfire too early and kill yourself (it will happen while you get a feel for it).  
---
Just keep trying different things and use the information given to you to get a good idea of what works and not.  
---
Yea, you can get away with DoT and wanding, but if you are trying to min/max there is always more you can do. Let me know if you have specific questions and I can try to answer them.
---
1.  People can play how they want.  Myself, I'm playing the long game.  But I've already enjoyed everything that you're just experiencing.  I had 4 characters in Vanilla.  Some people just want to get some end game content and skip the leveling process.
---
2. 60 is where the fun begins.
---
Yeah except all the effort/money they spent into leveling Tailoring. ;)
---
It's awful when the quest item looks similar to another inventory item. Lazily click on one and all your hard work out the window.
---
Same rules still apply,
---
Does it benefit you?
---
They are allowing limited time xfers from *specific* high pop servers to a corresponding *specific* low pop server. That is totally different than paid server xfers from any server to any server.
---
Paid xfers were used and abused in retail. They let people recruit guilds globally, since someone could just pop a server xfer to join them. It allows people to change their names. It destroys the entire culture of reputation that is a core social mechanic of classic wow, and it destroys any sense of server identity.
---
Wrong.  So, so wrong.
---
Classic has a very low skill floor to play it and a *very* high skill-cap to master it.  If you think Classic is easy then you have very little experience with vanilla.
---
What that guy said ^
---
Also, dont get caught up in the fomo of dungeons. If you dont have time to do them, do quests/processions/lvl alts, etc. Yes there is great gear in dungeons, but you'll get through fine questing/buying on ah. If you dont have time for dungeons odds are you dont have time for raids, and therefore it won't really matter if your guy isn't all BiS at lvl 60 anyway.
---
Too bad I don’t play retail anymore 🤷🏻‍♂️ thanks for the tip though
---
🎶 That's fuckin' team-work🎶
---
They earn honor in groups. So if they are healing a 3man they would earn the same other as the 2 others dealing damage.
---
This is the actual truth behind "you think you want it, but you don't".
---
It's not actually a bad additude for a dev, it just happens to be incorrect for classic wow
---
!RemindMe 9 hours
---
Some guy tipped me 25s for a basic lockbox that had an 6s item in it, maybe because I said no tip lol
---
Then don’t bring a level 58 to the raid if you’re not going to let them roll on anything they can use by the end of the day. Telling them they can roll on whatever they want, then saying “haha just kidding” is bullshit.
---
People defend them because the people asking for a reimbursement are consistently obnoxious about it.  Ethos/pathos are important parts of an argument.
---
Resto Druids are garbage too. The only thing they are good for is BREZ.  Shaman and Pally Healers&gt;All other
---
I think so, everyone wanted to play druid as projected to be a rare class, and guides said Locks were great for leveling so many people went for it.
---
Gz on your epic mount
---
I always thought of it as "Titan A.E. the MMO". It was a blast to play. I'll never forget the announcer when you leveled and the excitement your character showed. 
---
The original comment is the first I have heard it was shutdown. Not going to lie, although I obviously haven't been paying attention for a full year I'm sad that it is gone. I look forward to the private servers when they are playable. 
---
SWGEMU still holds a place in my heart, and Classic has been everything I could have wanted from Blizz. They did us a solid with this release.
---
Only bother with the ones that you can use to heal yourself and cure poisons/diseases. Resurrection is probably a good one to pick up as well.
---
/hug
---
There's a bit of vitriol being spewed around.  I just wanted to let you know, that I appreciate you.
---
In this instance stop kiting and run the mob back to the tank. His taunt is melee range and he isn’t going to run after you and turn his back with a pack of mobs on him to grab that one guy.
---
Sorry, you can say all that and it won't change the fact that the MoP talents felt like a shallow husk of their former selves.
---
Wasn't MoP so successful because it was riding the previous expansions success downhill?
---
You're telling me I quit because the game was 8 years old?  I quit because the game felt bad, the gameplay felt bad, the community was bad and the characters all became this boring homogenous blob.  I know you've read a lot of stuff about why WoW tanked and how it's not any of Blizzard's fault at all but I'm sorry that's just not correct.  I've seen this kind of stuff posted so much (mostly to blizzard's forums) and it's just so out of sync with reality I can't assume it was written by anyone who actually lived through the transition.
---
The thing you wrote felt like someone took a bunch of big tobacco catered information and wrote an article about how smoking isn't bad.
---
What is that creature next to the boar?
---
Ah, so now its a team game?
---
Food and water are limited to one stack of 20
---
I faintly recall falling off the tram because when you jumped you'd maintain your position not relative to the tram cart. Anyone else remember that?
---
Welcome to Azeroth:)
---
So it's just robe of the void and tailoring bonus from Bloodvine?
---
That's a really cool shammy.  I'd be kinda annoyed if I had to keep chain-healing my group (it burns more mana).
---
There's something satisfying about cooking up some food at an enemy's camp after killing all of them.
---
oh I just block people I see asking for layer invites
---
Yeah but Blizzard implementing requests was their own decision. 
---
Homogenizing pvp classes was due to complaints, as was lfg and lfr. 
---
Daily quests and achievements were all embraced by the community early on as well. 
---
If you look beyond a lot of those decisions many of them were designed to require engagement and reuse content. 
---
It was lazy design. There’s no lazy design in classic.
---
should I also have the highest life tap rank, i can get?
---
...there are actual naming rules on RP servers?
---
Exactly, just let them die.  The mob will run back to the tank after it kills the errant DPS.  More important to keep the tank alive at all costs, save your mana for that.
---
(Unless your mage is doing aoe packs on purpose, then spam heals on them of course)
---
Somebody linked this to me the other day. I'm specced arms while leveling and it seems to work fine.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/2zoe1p/z/cplcejo
---
Nope, except that it'd make doing quests together easier but that's besides the point. I've already come to terms that I'm morally wrong here. I see your point and I agree.
---
On the other end, Traditional parties are suffering the consequences of this stupid meta. You end up with shitty tanks trained in cleave groups that have never used Sunder Armor and are obsessed with damage meters when their priority should be on threat management. A well coordinated group should be able to progress with relatively little to no downtime, but these psychotic warriors, oftentime taking 1000hps in damage are blaming healers for not keeping them and the rest of their groups alive.
---
I'm not sure why this is here but I upvoted it.
---
That's beautiful
---
I'm waiting til L60 to finalize the button layout. I'll prob knock off a row once I have all my abilities and can memorize binds. Not pictured: pop up meters and hidden mouse over bars
---
I get that feeling when the kids I teach talk about pokemon. They ask how i know so much about pokemon and i have to explain i was 7 when Gen. 1 pokemon was new. Pikachu is nearly 20 years older than them.
---
I never once said you were expected to pay for his skills or that he should demand that you do... I’m saying if you’re spending dozens of gold on something because he didn’t see value in leveling it yet, Maybe you should have taken it upon yourself to not spend dozens of gold on food that he could have crafted had you given him 3 gold for the training haha. Never said it was expected of you but as a person that values my own money if I could give someone 3 gold for unlimited food or pay dozens to a vendor I’d have just paid my friend by now... or you can continue to complain that he doesn’t have it and continue to sink money into vendor food. It’s a game of choices.  He chose that conjure food wouldn’t have a return on investment for him because he doesn’t need food. (Which is true with or without you I leveled a mage to 60 solo always full health before my mana refilled) you chose to sink all your money into vendors and complain on reddit instead of tossing him 3 gold for unlimited food. That’s all I’m saying. It’s nobody’s responsibility but you could have solved it by even asking to cover half the cost. simply a suggestion for next time.
---
Cause I mostly play with my battle net buddies or guild mates who are not added as characters on my friend list. Plus it's not like cross server. These goobers will be on my server unless they transfer.
---
that is dump, i just was in a group with a lock, the lock gets HoT and Shield that's it. i had enouth to do with the tank and meele getting all kind of debuffs and shit in BSF ... go heal the lock in this is wasted mana. better spend on the tank pulling like chuck norris xD
---
Agree.. rupture is absolutely necessary. Thanks for the advice! Can't wait to hit 60 and spend my life dueling outside of org.
---
I’m using the 1.2 speed wand from dusk wood, can’t wait to see what this looks like on my gnome
---
That's what I get as a warrior, probably different results if you're a druid with swimming or a mage blinking.
---
Some kind of celebrity over here.
---
Reminds of when the onion stated that people now spend 90% of thier waking hours staring at glowing rectangles
---
All warriors benefit tremendously from spirit while leveling, so much so that I personally consider any low-level high-spirit item to be first-and-foremost a warrior item unless it has a high amount of int on it too.
---
Trolls though, it's impossible to get enough spirit to make it statistically significant in combat.
---
At 100 spirit (reasonably obtainable around level 35~40) you'd get like 4 health per second in combat and good luck getting spirit on your combat gear after 40.
---
It's totally understandable that I can't collect any snouts when I've just murdered the boars with huge fucking fireballs.
---
It's a talent.
---
(Shakes fist) it's a bloodbath at Hillsbrad 24/7. General chat bogged down screaming about the pesky alliance mowing down the low-mid twenties. When are you going to retry north STV?
---
That happened in my last group. Literally 3 of us typed do not light the torches let the tank do it. One dude went and lit all of them. Luckily the mobs arent all linked so we could do it in 2 pulls after that first wipe. It was pretty funny but annoying with how the alliance gy is in darkshore.
---
Although this is true. Despite weight it would take a MASSIVE shift for something to rise up and be thrown how its trying to be portrayed. In a commercial airliner at that.
---
Your name! We’re like brothers! I’m Ventari!
---
Oh the shammy was great. The tank was a lil overleveled for the dungeon (42 or 43 warrior in RFD) so he wasn’t doing much healing. The shaman told me to just go ham tapping and hellfiring. Greatest day of my life.
---
Dont forget to create a raid warning macro describing what the symbols mean
---
Have my upvote.
---
Spirit and int are definitely very important, but they don't add the same kind of raw throughput as +healing. Youll have more available mana with spirit/int, but you aren't really increasing your ability to heal (other than int giving crit chance, which falls of the more you have)
---
Not anymore :P
---
Palpatine power level
---
I've seen plenty of people on Grobbulus have forced name changes already and let's face it they have more pressing issues to deal with at this moment. Just give it time and feel free to report any names you see that you don't think fit in with the rules.
---
Of course it's a gnome giving the quest too lol
---
Mickey Avalon &lt;3
---
I’m expecting name flags to happen after Blizzard has more expensive resources to deal with something they’d consider trivial (Compared to handling launch). I’ve already seen many guilds get name flagged, Fat Boss guild being flagged for rename was hilarious
---
Nothing like helping out someone who's dangerously close to dying. Feels good, man.
---
Blizzard sent you to the shadow realm.
---
Some days ago in Stonetalon mountains I stole a kingsblood from a guy who was fighting a basilisk. He said fuck you and I felt bad, so I wanted to give the kingsblood to him. I said wait and ran after him, but he would not stop. After following him for 2 minutes I finally caught up with him and was  ready to trade, but he had put me on ignore so I couldn't trade with him.
---
You can absolutely tank with a 2 hander until you get to end game dungeons. I always start with my 2 hander but I'm willing to switch to my shield if the healer is struggling. I haven't had to switch yet (and that's with some healers that don't meet the level requirement for the dungeon quests and can't even use the gear that drops yet). I honestly don't think most people notice, the dungeons generally aren't hard.
---
GOTORETAIL
---
Ahh okay yeah that makes sense, I’ve only played retail till now.
---
Maybe they killed you for being a disgustingly filthy carebear
---
It was shitty hardware. Also, there was no spell queueing back then (classic has it though) which led to us using stopcast macros and judging latency to know when we could stop a cast and still have it fire, essentially faking queuing.
---
Just report it as you see it.  Put them on ignore and move on.  It sucks but blizzard will catch up eventually.
---
Melee weapons are for killing critters.
---
This makes me a sad panda.
---
They were fun precisely because of their difficulty. Loot piñatas aren’t fun, working to achieve something feels so much better.
---
Because Ret is extremely Crit reliant and while every other stat on the sword is used by the Ret, it gives an additional +2% Crit chance flat. That stat alone has so much value for the Ret. 
---
As for Shaman, it’s mostly because they are so reliant on RNG. The Sulfuras procs during a wind fury downtime can save them from benching next raid. Proc during a Windfury, and you’re shooting to the top of the meter.
---
Any other weapon with that much damage and a similar proc would also be great. There are none.
---
Go in a SM Armory AoE Spam group.
---
You are looking for AtlasLootEnhanced. Addon still not updated for Classic. I am pretty sure there a a lot of people waiting for it :)
---
I got 2 of them by level 3... is my loot luck used up? :(
---
Question: what happens if the enemy priest mindcontrolls me into a pack of mobs? Can he hold me there to die? Di they start chasing him?
---
To a degree it is true.

I mean UDs feel pain, they can move, think and act om their own and they have kind of cells...

What server are you on? I was able to do arathi highlands this weekend at 39 pretty easily. I am in STV now and am 41 I don't get messed with too much.
---
He’s a large name for retail raiders. Makes WoW raid boss guides
---
2.5 levels until it stops. You can usually push that a solid amount from turning in quests though
---
The first 10 levels of playing a hunter is god awful. Once you get your pet at level 10 it’s smooth sailing
---
Yeah, I’m seeing a lot of those ultra sensitive or entitled people lately and it’s kinda getting annoying.

I was making a group for the quest assault on fenrise isle, we were 4 people and needed a healer to be able to kill the elite, I ask in general chat 2 priests replied. One was at the sepulcher (town) and the other was literally standing right next to us. I invited the first priest who was lvl 18? I think I can’t remember, the one with us was 22. This was during the time when silverpine was packed (3days after launch). I told the priest we invited that since our dps were in a hurry and he was in town (he did not start moving to us yet) that he should find a new group as there is a priest standing right next to us and that we would invite him instead and he could find or fully form a new group by the time he got here. I wait for a reply. He does not reply, I check the map again and he still has not moved. So I assumed he was either afk or not reading chat. I remove him from group, we invite the other priest and we manage to kill the elite just barely. As we were about to hearth out, I get a /w from the priest we removed saying  “glad to see groups mean something to people”. I wanted to reply with “hey sorry dude but (explain what I said earlier basically)” but he had put me on ignore.
---
My first thought? What did I do that was so horrible that they had to put me on ignore for?
---
My second thought? Hah, good riddance..
---
The posts about these things beg to differ
---
No I do not, but I’m gonna get one tonight! I didn’t know that so thank you!
---
Rumour is that Chestnutz has 2 orange pieces that he just keeps in his bank...
---
dude just report the names its super easy. ive had guild members pissed off at me cause i said i reported and no joke, within a few minutes they said "hey its \_\_\_ i just got forced to change my name"
---
I just flew United two nights ago and played from LAX to ORD with about 400ms latency the entire time. It’s all satellite powered but works well enough in desperate circumstances !
---
People get spendy after that 40 mount hurtle. Speaking from personal experience
---
Clearly never married.
---
Right, but most people will still see it as an act of assault and fight back.  Tends to happen when you take control of people's minds, even if your intentions are pure.
---
The download is about 4.7 gb if memory serves so probably between 5-10 gb.
---
Will do
---
Kill stuff sell stuff eventually you will have it. I killed cats for hours.
---
I was questing in swamp of sorrows collecting meat from the crocs or snappers or w/e.
---
I was getting 2 drops every 3 kills so I was rolling along until I got to 7/8 collected.
---
I grinded those mobs for another 2 hours straight, well over 100 mobs (I counted the leather after I was done skinning them all) just waiting for the drop thinking “it’ll happen on the next one” and got so frustrated I submitted a ticket and hearthed to org to check my auctions and log.
---
In the process of depositing my meat into the bank, I noticed a solo meat that wasn’t stacking with anything, and somehow it was the stupid quest item I needed.  I think I killed and looted one on my way out of swap of sorrows after accepting the quest but before deciding to quest there as the mobs were too high, and just deposited it in my bank like I do with all future cooking materials.
---
Meanwhile I had a handful of extra quest items from overlooting for other quests... gotta love consistency!
---
&gt; And nobody in my guild wants to run a dungeon they have already levelled past. 
---
This is why I like the BC dungeon system, you don't feel like you're missing out if you skip the dungeons while leveling since you can do Heroic at 70.
---
Wait how are you on Reddit? That doesn't look like the bathroom
---
Yeah, this is a great strategy, though primarily against enemies lower level than you. If you are purely grinding mobs for XP, this is the way to go. 
---
Cleave is situationally useful which is why I didn't bring it up here. Since it adds weapon damage for 20 rage, it is doing significantly more damage than HS.

---
You know, back in 2006-2007, an official Blizzard guy on the official forums said that there were still undiscovered quests in WoW.
---
After the game had been out for 12-18 months.
---
We never heard anything about it afterwards, I have no idea if they put them back in the new vanilla WoW.
---
is there any "if then" or "true" statement?  doesn't look like it from reading commands but i feel i have seen some macros that work with brackets of commands i couldn't find on a list.
---
Kansas City?  I’m getting 15-20 ms as well here.
---
3.5 gb
---
Oh ah price is to high here, get a layer this is such a bad idea. The AH is fine as is.
---
you are correct mostly there is one case where heroic strike spamming is better which is dual wielding with a slow main hand and a fast off hand.
---
if you do the math you will say that i am wrong since it still won't add up but you see there is a bug with heroic strike that has never ever been fixed.
---
when you make your main hand a yellow damaging ability it makes your off-hand into your main hand for things like damage, miss chance, and rage regen suddenly heroic strike isn't costing you that rage regen and adding a whole lot more damage.
---
Something ive never thought about ,are we viewing this from the blasted lands or outland?
---
I heard the reason why Ulda is so screwed up with the level ranges is because they originally intended it to be two dungeons but they scrapped that idea, except they didn't fix the final boss' level to adjust for the merging
---
Fuck him, tell him to leave /2 channel then
---
You are actually right, didn't know I could do that, thank you
---

---
I lasted like an hour if that. The gameplay of retail is just awful for me. Can't really pinpoint it. It's mostly just that nothing actually matters and you don't have a real goal. You're just hoping RNG hits just right for the right rolled piece of gear with the right bonuses, rather than going in saying "ok I need to kill x boss to get y item"

Literally the point of trade chat. Tell that nutmuffin to go away and put him on ignore.
---
With having a S/O it’s of harder to spam dungeons which is what all my friends are doing and there smoking me. Feels bad man.
---
Which server is this, so people can know block/ignore the right person?
---
Yes, moreso even. Threat is the key and the rage penalty of hs is more an issue compared to the extra threat of sunder
---
Bruh...
---
Think of all the annoying and unhelpful shit that goes on in trade chat. At least someone advertising their AH items is related to the game. 
---
Just ignore him.
---
Ignore him and move on
---
3500 ms ping....
---
Smells like Vanilla!
---
You certainly still get the joys of 39% spell resist on top of all the melee penalties. Whee!
---
I’ve been the opposite. I’ve had great groups but twice the survival of the group came down to me, I’m a healer, and it went badly. Like comically bad.
---
lucky me pulled 2 poles within 3 min span
---
i think the ignore feature is a wonderful thing
---
Fairbanks Horde, baby!
---
There should be no issue. Trade chat is for trading items, services. If he doesn't like it ignore him and move on. If anything all the LFG chatter in it is more annoying.
---
This was way back in BC, but it happened in Vanilla content before the levelling experience was completely trivialized, so- Anyway, there's that Forsaken messenger quest in Arathi Highlands/Hillsbrad Foothills where there's a Forsaken messenger who patrols back and forth between the Horde bases in Hillsbrad and Arathi.  There's a quest to intercept him and a message that's being sent to Hillsbrad.  He has a pair of guards with him.  I had the brilliant idea to sap him. 
---
This stopped all three of them in their tracks - I wasn't sure what I was expecting, really, because I was a terrible rogue at the time, and while I was standing there going "oh, uh, okay, what do I do now?" another pair of Alliance players came up, aggroed the guards and while they were dealing with them, without thinking I killed the messenger and looted him while they were fighting his adds. I got a "really?" from one of them and apologized profusely. I don't remember if I offered to help them or not but I don't actually think I did, so my scummiest accomplishment is stealing a quest mob from my own faction while they killed his adds.
---
...I'm not proud of it and I would do things differently today if Ic ould but there it is.
---
Meanwhile the rogue is doing double your DPS and doesn't need healing for the most part.  
---
I have grouped with one awesome lock, though.  This dude made healthstones like every pull and ate em mid fight after life tapping.  He'd bandage and drink and do everything he could to heal himself.  That's a guy I don't mind throwing a heal to in a pinch, at least he's trying.

Honestly there is no right answer to that. It really just boils down to what you enjoy. You could go tailoring and make your own armor.
---
Damn that was the server I was going to roll on but friends talked me into whitemane.
---
30-40ms.
---
I thought Cata was pretty strong minus LFR and the nerfs to heroics
---
You certainly need a ton of computers in the botnet, which aren't easy to get.
---
Loch Modan has been my favorite zone visited thus far. Love the terrain, the environment, the giant body of water covering half the zone, the islands you have to swim to. Only problem is doesn't have many quests. You have to really alternate between this zone and something like Westfall.
---
I feel you either /2 advertise your item, or you put it in the ah, but not both. 
---
If everyone advertised their ah sales it would be madness. The ah is effectively to help cut out the middle man (e.g, you), so to advertise ah sales seems redundant (although I get the obvious possible benefit).
---
That said, i dont mind one bit when I see people doing it, unless they are spamming.
---
sell your virtual body, ERP for gold.
---
Tell that fairy to go cry somewhere else, what you did was fine

There are some conditionals but you can't check if buffs exist or anything like that.
---
But blizzard over the years killed alot of logic that could be done by macros and addons. Best you can do is google macro conditions.
---
My mistake, edited
---
I was thinking this would be the next most useful buff! 
---
It almost seems more useful in the long run of the fight compared to even the raw 10 int?

Thank you for the confirmation everyone!

Ah, rats. But that's just one example I found in a lazy/hasty Internet search. I got mine for the same price, same as my fiancee and former roommate. Mine is a Haworth Zody though, so not the same chair, but just as good.
---
Outcast? Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright
---
I stick to just heal and lesser heal. Heal is your most efficient for the mana used. So I just use heal when someone is nearing half health. And since it’s your biggest heal it gives you the most time between uses so your mana regen can build up. You just have to start charging up your heals earlier since the cast time takes a bit. Flash heal is a waste of mana unless you need it, and renew I only use if so much dmg is going on the tank that I need that extra HoT to be able to keep up with things without him dying.
---
I use Windows key and print screen and gets saved in the screen shots folder. Though print screen is just as good. I hate those phone camera shots. Jeez!
---
never been ganked in retail?
---
It's hard to suggest a level for the dungeons as it's going to vary widely based on which dungeon, your role, gear, mechanical skill, and experience in that dungeon. The min tank, dps, and heals levels are my best attempt at an objective "suggested level", any more than that would be personal opinion and I think not everyone would be in agreement.
---
If you want my opinion, I think the most comfortable spot for all of these dungeons is going to be 1 level above the min tank level. So for example, min chart level for RFK tank is 30 and DPS is 29, but you'll probably have the best experience doing it at about 31 in either role.
---
So check the column for your role, then add 1 or 2 levels if you want the most comfortable experience!
---
Look at all those bovine! It's a goddamn stampede!
---
Is that in classic? I can't find anything about items associated with either clan on wowhead classic
---
my gaming addiction is back man..HARD. I been doing gaming as of late mainly because thats what I conditioned myself for all these years..but the games were lackluster, MOST. Vanilla came out and I knew i would love it, I played the Private Servers, but Classic just got a hold of me and didnt let go.  I have been staying way past my bed time, I am smoking less weed(like WTF?!) because I dont want to stop playing, I am communicating with people in game, I am enjoying the whole leveling process, and most of all I know that each piece I get is meaningful.  Greens when leveling up feel so important, you can most likely NOT afford to trash or sell it.  I also dont feel like "Why am I doing this? XX Expansion will come out in 6months and this system will be trashed" I am investing a lot of time into my professions, even secondary.  My role seems more impactful in the guild with my professions.  Nostalgia helps, but that alone cant keep the playerbase. I had hardcore nostalgia about Phantom Dust, when it finally came to xbox one I probably put like 1hr into it..Something with WoW classic just clicks in my head. I love it.
---
Nothing to report unless you can prove they’re using automation. Blizzard has been okay with multiboxing since Vanilla.
---
Correct. That's why it makes me mad. The AH economy is super messed up right now on my realm. Why would you list an item for less than it costs to just vendor the item?
---
Spent 3 hours doing the elite quests in hinterlands today with a group of three. It was so bad, loved it tho.
---
Thats some real Star Trek level special effects there! :D
---
You can’t really. Multi boxing isn’t illegal. He’s paying for his accounts.
---
On Arugal server. Spent last night killing horde in Desolace.. I Don't feel bad, I'm happy you guys banded a group at the end and took us on (killed us all a couple of times, like we killed you guys). Helped turn a really awful day at work into something special.

That's the great thing about wow classic, we can spend our energy on whatever part of the experience we want
---
I'm gonna see how well it goes as a mage with the extra 15% from Azure Silk Belt.
---
if he can cheat, everyone will.. and if its a RDP from his phone to home network/pc, people are already doing that... (which seems like more effort than making a new realm work)
---
I missed classic pvp - no rules, unplanned, etc. Ganking is great, but it is also amazing to be ganked and win (or make it to south shore and have a guard kill them)
---
objectively incorrect. healers only need to hit players. dungeon mobs can outlevel you just fine and by 30 you definitely have the toolkit range to heal properly. ive not had an issue  with groups or healing. just sayin, dont judge your healer on their level like you would a dps or tank.
---
i have it on autocast all the time, that way you can tank a mob which starts running towards the group and not reach the casters + you allow the tank to pull more mobs that way because you mitigate damage. My level 50 raptor has 4.6k armor and exactly 50% damage reduction. thats twice as much as the tank
---
Is there a website or some sort of compilation of these different sorts of tips for warriors?
---
Multiboxing is not against the rules.
---
The real questions
---
5 people cant have similar names, thats illegal!?!?!?
---
You're 100% correct and I didn't follow this until level 30+. Once I started going
---
- Charge, rend, switch to zerker stance, sunder sunder (hamstring if they're a runner) sunder, execute
---
I started to notice mobs would go down quicker and I had far more rage to play with.
---
Tell you what though, once you get whirlwind and MS, the game changes as a warrior. I now dont sunder unless it's a mob with massive armor
---
Tanking is hilariously painful with everyone not attacking the skull and telling you to use shield slam.
---
It did exist in vanilla.
---
I feel your pain. Ran from crossroads to BFD and didn’t pick up a single flight path on the way.
---
You're giving retail too much credit by saying only 1 thing makes retail bad.
---
Retail has hundreds of fundamental problems that can't be solved because the masses that now play WoW won't let Blizz change them.
---
As a priest I always feel like a burden asking a mage for water because I ask for like 80 water. I do give them a tip always, about 10s or more
---
I wish I had the time to do that...honestly might take a few days off work lol
---
I am new to this whole streaming thing! Trying it out, let's hang out and have some fun. Always looking for people to play with!
---
eww wowwiki
---
Its not rocket appliances
---
This especially seems to be the case in dungeons like Uldaman, where you have quests that involve returning multiple times to the dungeon.
---
Ermm, I've spent 14 of the last 14 days playing this game and I'm not burned out. Is this what addiction looks like?
---
If you're using zpearl there's another add-on you're supposed to download for Omni cc to work listed on omnicc's download page on curse forge and there's an option to select on zpearl to get it to work with it. But, it never worked for me so I'm still looking for a new unit frame replacement.

---
So add a filter, those with x reports for ninja looting unable to server xfer for a substantial period of time.
---
Reminds me of the post of someone who had it hooked into their phone and had leveled to something like 25 playing only on their phone. They had used a priest. Seems like it would be easiest playing a class like mage or priest whose primary playstyle in earlier levels is only pressing 2-3 buttons. I could imagine controlling a hunter pet for example might be a little harder on the phone or at least a little extra time to set up key binds and macros properly
---
Does your rage dump when you swap stances?
---
Go to the arms section and set your level to 10 or higher. It will also reference the spreadsheet where the math has been done.
---
Edit: Section 3
---
I made the mistake of going with 5% extra mana instead of the extra block chance, so I'll likely be sticking with two handers for the time being myself. But I might respec later to fine tune it.
---
Two handers will dish out more damage. But you might run out of mana faster if you need to heal yourself more often. In the end, the difference might not be much, though, since you have spells and totems that add to your damage and you don't rely exclusively on white damage.
---
same here on Skeram. Questing is basically impossible. 100s of people in STV going after the same 10 mobs.
---
It's an actual rule that they actively enforced up until end of Wotlk, then they became more relaxed about it.
---
I was fishing in STV 30 minutes before the ddos started. I found a dwarf hunter fishing a node. I wanted it. Lightning bolt chain lightning earth shock lightning bolt and dead. All he did was keyboard turn towards me with his bobber still in the water. 
---
I started fishing his node. He spawned again and the cheeky fuck put his bobber back in the water.

---
rip
---
Its not against tos, its just a scumbag thing the community hates.
---
you're correct, it is not. You can swap to zerker stance, pop rage, and swap back to battle stance in 1 GCD
---
You can rent botnets. You don't need to build it yourself
---
Layering is the only reason the queue isn't still 10K+ all day long. I'll take it.
---
Renew isn't efficient. 
---
However, if you talent it (+15%) and get some Healing Power, it can become good. It benefits more from Healing Power than any other spell.
---
Use Renew when:
---
- You're on the run
---
- You need to be casting on the tank, but need to throw a quick heal on someone else.
---
- Spam Heal isn't enough, so you have to layer your HoT on top.
---
Its really good advice though.
---
I wouldn't waste 2 points in improved charge, this is a very small bonus for a skill you can't use that often.
---
2 points in overpower would be more beneficial but when you actually have free points to use (after you unlock sweeping stike), I prefer to put them in improved 2H weapon.
---
Yep I bought the frames I wanted at a severe discount and sent it to a lab myself to get lenses with blue blocking and other cool things. Saved probably $500 instead of going through an eyeglass office.
---
Gotcha.  Like is it displayed on the character creation screen, telling you not to? Or is it something people kind of have to figure out themselves.
---
Good because if I see you messing with people your level I’m gonna corpse camp you until classic wow 2
---
lol in yeti cave last night I killed a mage and was in combat with a warrior, he had me close to half health but he was almost dead. I knew I had to finish it before he could execute. I pooled my energy for the finishing wombo combo, which involved pulling another yeti, then kidney shotting the warrior with 5 cps and watching the 2 yetis and my poison finish off the last quarter of his health as he couldn't fight back.
---
SM belongs to the horde.
---
Same thing happened to me and a warrior doing WW axe quest, I was  helping him and a group of horde came along aswell doing it. They had a huntard that was skull level who killed me once but they must have told him offf after as they helped the warr get the axe
---
Playing warrior right now and waiting to be high enough to do SM armory farming. I’ve run library a bunch of times and seen so much dank caster gear drop
---
People like to embellish how cool and badass they are online. Those things likely never happened.
---
I don’t see anything wrong. Someone who can’t move out of the raid when he’s the bomb shouldn’t be raiding ever. I wouldn’t let some complete moron waste 39 people’s consumables and gold for repair.
---
My main on retail that I made back in Wotlk is Sodiumchloride :')
---
Only time I used Heroic back in the old days was raid tanking or boss tanking. That was usually when I had rage for days. Heroic strike is your threat generator once you have full sunder stacks up and just have rage to burn.
---
Right, I'm suggesting an added filter or penalty for doing so.
---
Oof. I was lucky and got the path at Camp T.
---
Warlock enthusiast here, could you set up a quick framework about Lock dungeon xp farming, in regards to build, recommended dungeons and your role/playstyle
---
Create a ticket I'm game using the help section in game and report him there explaining what happened and they'll be banned.
---
+spell hit gear isnt really in the game yet. Which is why no one is telling him to stack it as the most important stat.
---
I've been waiting 13 years to go back to STV and Southshore. Silithus and Plaguelands are gonna be Awesome in a bit when they're overflowing with targets.
---
Southshore has some good terrain, but often it's the population as a central zone that drives those conflicts. It's flat lands often lend themselves to larger battles and border skirmishes where the sight lines and ranges of mages are the range of engagements.
---
STV is a Melee paradise as it is very much more 3 dimensional with it's hills and bridges setting countless ambush points and dense ground cover make it easy for non-stealth allies to hide. As a Druid it's awesome to jump out of stealth off a bridge and catch someone on the lower level with Feral Charge in an aerial Rawrbomb.
---
There's various reasons why each Contested area holds a special place in my heart, and you can see how the terrain design makes battlegrounds exciting and unique (WSG has tunnels, flat lands, medium cover, buffs and Specific objectives, AB has control points and elevation, bottlenecks/extreme sight lines, AV is a massive 3 dimensional monstrosity with varied sub objectives)
---
Great Photo!!
---
That's pretty racist, man. But what else could you expect from the Alliance?
---
The argument is that if classes can do multiple things why should they be as good as classes that can’t.  All of those specs are classes that can heal and two of them can tank as well.  Why should they be able to DPS as well as a dps class that doesn’t have the versatility.  Spend a little gold and suddenly you have a whole new character while the pure dps has to reroll.
---
Edit:  though I agree it is more perception than anything else.  If a non dps class is 85% of the damage of a pure dps then it is competitive enough.  Might be able to beat inferior players even.
---
Are you paying for the standard bag?
---
People joke but hunters have quite a few different things to manage that can be hard to deal with for new players.
---
It is known.
---
Figured this out on my Troll this weekend while ranting to my friends about how racist the Kirin Tor is not letting any Troll mages  in the Six.
---
And then you kill him at the end when he has two mobs on him and 50% life....because...you Undead...wtf did he expect?
---
Your arguments kinda falls if you dont.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-warrior-leveling-guide
---
I stopped playing shortly after BC came out ... so however long that is, lol. For me, WOW Classic is the only WOW I really ever knew. Feels good to be back. I just have to be careful to not get overly addicted as I'll miss seeing friends, family, and the outdoors.
---
I just had a tauren warrior steal the tag for one of the mine bosses in Tarren Mill from me when I pulled him and a mob thats tied to him (unavoidable double pull) so as I was killing the add, he takes the tag and I just tab out to change the youtube video to something else while I'm playing and about to wait. I tab back in and the boss spawns in 2 dwarven adds (he did this to me when I fought him also) and tauren warrior raged hard in my DMs his entire walk back because "i didn't help him when he helped me" by the time I tabbed back in and realized what happened he was like half health and already dead. His PMs were so fucking weird telling me that "everything I say isn't from this era/generation". First ignore of classic so far.
---
Don't steal my tag, Monsterkyle, and if you do, make sure you can chew what you bite off.
---
Go home OP you are drunk
---
That's exactly how it works....
---
I have a laptop with no prntscreen button on the keyboard :(
---
Blizzard hasn’t shut down any private servers in a while. Now they host them in countries that make it very difficult.
---
The most popular vanilla server in the last 1-2 years even announced when they started that they were shutting down willingly when classic launched and the private server community looked at the other vanilla servers at the time as meme servers.
---
But either way it still doesn’t explain it because he was ddosing retail and overwatch too.
---
Don't forget to go outside every once in a while :D 
---
Have fun though!
---
don't buy food, fish it up and cook it yourself!
---
Please....you deserve a medal. I know people who didn’t find the Tram until BC.
---
Let's be honest here. He's using third part programs to control 4 of the same class. Maybe even for the priest as well. It would be insanely difficult without something broadcasting keystrokes. 
---
Imo they should just ban it, at least on RP servers, but they didn't. Oh well.
---
There are toxic people everywhere. It's up to you to put in the effort to put them on ignore
---
Can you dance during gcd? Then there'd be time for a quick dance directly between corruption and starting the drain rota. An additional one if you start with immolate/CoA.
---
Then do what I did.
---
I like classic more. It has more of a RPG and Adventure feel to it and it feels harder just in the open world.
---
Anything to stay out of the queue
---
Shamans are one of the best, if not THE best, group support class in the game.
---
Your first point is technically true, but not applicable to any current warriors. No warrior should be dual wielding until at least AQ as they lack the hit from gear to make it worthwhile.
---
Eastern Kingdoms appeared to have a lot more time and detail paid attention to it
---
Kalimdor was like, quick we gotta make another continent
---
This is why low pop servers are shit. Im guessing your server is one because on a high pop that would have never had happened. I got my Robe of Arcana for like 1g.  Not blaming you though. Youre just being smart about it.
---
I somehow doubt that person was joking about overwatch
---
&gt; but wars are fairly easy matchups for a rogue
---
Stopped reading here as you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Mages are such great folks, they've even made their tower handicap accessible.
---
Yes hes a rare in the barrens. Humar the Pridelord.
---
**Update** OP is actually dead now.
---
&gt;Lmao, we marked and CCed all through classic. Where were you?
---
Apparently playing a different game to you.
---
Marks didn't come until later in Classic. Shit, I'm actually not completely convinced they didn't come in TBC, but they definitely weren't there for most of the time anyone was doing 5mans, pre-Raids or most of the Raids. 
---
And CC? What CC?
---
Only Mages and Rogues have CC and Rogues have to spec into it or it de-stealths them. 
---
The only """""""CC"""""""" I can remember being consistently applied was that one of your Hunters would kite one of Drek's adds away at the end of UBRS.
---
AtlasLoot classic, and the maps module
---
You can heal 60 dungeons in shadow if you have a good tank
---
If the thing you're fighting is your level + 2 or lower, use Sunder Armor. Lower armor = more damage = more rage per swing.
---
If the thing you're fighting is your level +3 or more, use Heroic Strike. Special attacks (yellow) cannot be glancing blows which significantly reduce damage. Even with a 5 stack of sunder your white attacks (whenever they actually connect) will be considerably less damage than a Heroic Strike which is more likely to connect and cannot be glanced.
---
To be honest, not sure. I don't play on RP servers. I think blizz relies on people reporting troublesome names to be examined.
---
I'm secretly hoping for a private server build.
---
You have to embed details into right chat. There should be embed options in the elv settings.
---
But what if they had awesome mounts /(maybe reusable item skin instead of transmog)/pets etc. Attacked to raids again instead of stuck in the payshop?
---
It was actually an upgrade at the time and looks cool
---
When me and my friend started playing in BC we both made Belves and at level 5 wanted to get to UC. We didn't know about the transporter device so started running...do you have any idea how big the aggro radius was for level 5s in Eastern Plaguelands? Because I do and its pretty damned large.
---
Before reduction. Yes it is. That's with "decent gear". 
---
Most warriors won't have WW axe at 30. They are likely using, at best, Corpsemaker until mid 30's but likely something worse. But even with WW axe...that's 30%...what's sunder offering you? Less.
---
A corpsemake has 132 TED so 52 dmg on a HS is more than 30% increase.
---
OR
---
A white swing from 180 going to 220 is almost 25%.
---
Again, sunder offers you...what...before the mob dies...?
---
Easy solution.  If you have any plans to play a paladin or shaman, then roll that faction.
---
I have never once seen it. My issue is getting quests done when 20 other players are spamming everything lol
---
The difference is we aren’t currently playing a video game... these people are advocating creating drama in game. Surely you can appreciate that difference.
---
Not only that but he begs for subs when the servers are down and ends up getting 1k+ subscriptions, times that by five dollars. He’s raking in the dough.
---
I haven't read "carebear" used in that way in like a decade. Did you wake up from a coma, and just get back into the game?
---
This is OPs Widow: He passed doing what he loved. F's in chat.
---
Yes horde have two meaty quests to kill the lv20 - 23 mountain lions and bears and spiders around tarren mill and the yeti cave. they are low drop rate loot quests so horde can spend an entire level grinding those two starter quests. then we get sent to the alliance mob town for mobs lv22-26 and easily groupable by lower levels
---
the quest chain is honestly some "morally grey" meme tier forsaken fucked up shit and alliance players caring about RP would easily kill any horde there
---
Diced jalapeno, onion, an egg, whatever lunch meat is in the fridge. Throw it all in before the water boils, let it boil a min or 2 then throw your noodles in. Pepper pepper pepper. Maybe some Italian seasoning if your feeling froggy. Drain the majority of the water, top with liberal amounts of shredded cheese or parmesan shaker cheese, or both. Enjoy.
---
You're welcome.
---
Lol. How meta of you.
---
Also good to have is DBM - it will gently remind you of boss mechanics.
---
You could also feign death
---
And you don't here.
---
Hit us up with a top notch macro fam
---
Tactical mastery. It's basically a required talent when leveling.
---
My friend and I had this great idea for a twinked out character. We ran a lvl 10 character  to Felwood and had him die in the grinding area, then paired him with a lvl 60 character who would clear the reputation giving mobs. You could still get reputation while dead if you are in the party, not sure if this still works. One mob at a time, we got this lvl 10 to exalted with the Timbermaw. It took days.
---
Turns out, you can't use the trinket at that level. But I'll be damned if that wasn't the most reputable twink that ever lived.
---
Except self respect.
---
F....
---
It was not, but I mean in my eyes what harm does it do... like is it game breaking to make people accidentally fly across the continent accidentally with nothing they can do to stop it?
---
Fellow lock here! What should I spec at 60? I’m currently aff with a bit of demonology in imp imp/vw for leveling.
---
I didnt realise mana even regenerated during combat until I posted here. And yeah I just spam lesser heal rank 3. Has been working pretty good xD.
---
Nope this was added much later on into the game. So it's not going to get "added" In
---
Hello sir,
---
1.Could you tell me a macro or something that I can use to let my pet attack faster? Sometimes my imp need 1 or 2 finished spells till it will cast his attacks. Which is a lot of waste time. And I don't want to click his attack button with the mouse all the time.
---
2. Iam just level 8 now, but how do you do damage in dungeons? I think mobs die very fast so it's hard to make dots work because mobs just die to early. Do you dot everything and just keep ur dots up? Or do you only spam shadowbold?
---
3. Is the level 40 mount allready InGame? Or does it come with a later patch? Do I just learn it at the warlock trainer? Or is it a quest?
---
4. What talents you go when leveling mostly solo with some dungeon? I thought the demon tree plus dot tree looks nice for leveling. 
---
5. Why do you play warlock? What makes this class so fun for you? 
---
Have a nice day and Good loot next reset.
---
Is this a real thing? I'm gonna have to see a source.
---
Just got to 33 last night. I didn't even find the grind to 30 that bad. Grouped up when quests were hard, solo'd fairly effectively otherwise.
---
Not to humble brag (or maybe its cause the only lvling experience I am familiar with is war/pally), but I think the grind of lvling a warrior is overstated (unless it gets significantly worse past 35?)
---
WORK IS DA POOP!
---
I spent a week in the Badlands at 60 killing every horde Hunter I saw trying to tame brokentooth. And killing him anytime I saw him alive and I was about to get off. During retail vanilla at least. Now I'm a warrior and the karma from that has come back to me bad...
---
nah, shadow priest (yea I'm nuts)
---
Gz, I got a parrot from the Deadmines pirates.
---
How tho? Like when and where did it originate? I remember just starting to hear people say it all over the place and I'm still just over here like "...what?"
---
Most people respond to mind rape pretty aggressively, no matter how "pure" the intentions.
---
......yeah right
---
Now this is a message I approve of! Lok'tar ogar!
---
Tactical mastery
---
I literally made 26-30 gold (had to buy drinks and food) from lvl 36 to 37 between selling greens professions bank alts and quest rewards he should be good
---
Don't they also investigate the reports if they are found to be false?
---
The necklace quest can be done in a single run for the part that is inside Uldaman.
---
If you gather the gems before killing the golem boss, you can complete it in 1 go.
---
So usually when I'm in a dungeon and just looking to deal some damage while healing, I will start out with holy fire since i can start casting as the tank goes in and they will get a swing or two off before my cast finishes. Then I drop SWP.  Smite does solid damage, but if you have a top of the line wand, wand DPS can sometimes out do smite spam.
---
Does your warrior partner use defensive stance to keep aggro or do they just do enough damage that you generally don't pull threat?  Mind blast is good damage and a short cast, but you're right, it pulls a lot of threat so it's not a good opener if you're trying to let them keep aggro. When my warrior pal and I are doing quests we either do hard mobs (orange colored) and tag team, or split and take on our own mobs if we're against yellows.  Mind Flay needs to be something like rank 3 (I think level 36?) before it's really worth using for damage, it's still good for controlling fleeing mobs or mobs you've feared before that.  SWP is always your best damage to mana ratio. Hard casts depend on how long you've had that rank of the spell vs new ranks of other spells and how much DPS your wand is doing. If you get a new rank of smite, it might be a lot more damage per second than your wand, but when you're 1-2 levels away from the next rank of smite and you've kept your wand slot upgraded it will likely win out over wasting mana on smite.
---
The nice thing about priest is that you can succeed in all 3 trees, solo, and even more so with you having a warrior companion to help.  If you're on a PVP server you could go for more defensive/healing oriented skills, if you're on a PVE one then you can just focus on improving your damage.  The problem is that most of the big spell damage boosting talents are mid tier talents in each tree.  So I would review what they give you and see what you think you'll like more.  Shadow does more damage once you get higher in the tree, but before that it's mostly utility and cooldown/threat reduction. Holy and disc will improve healing/protection spells early and have the damage options higher in the tree.  Disc is mainly about mitigation, instant casts and mana conservation, holy is about making beefier heals and holy spells.  I think you could go in any of these trees and do fine, shadow will be more damage, but if you're staying with your friend and don't want to pull aggro, normal shadow leveling doesn't grab things like aggro reducing talents, and shadow form won't let you heal outside of vamp embrace.  Shadow is quite good but if you're going to stick with your warrior pal you might be better served going another route.  I've always kind of been a solo person myself so I'm not sure what the best answer is in your situation.
---
Use Demo over BS for rage, otherwise I feel like you're right.  
---
But overall you don't want to use shields as a tank unless you're in a raid, 2hnd with sweeping strikes is by far the easiest spec to tank with while leveling (lvl 40 atm).
---
No, it was not in Classic. But you could log out, and it would have you land at the next stop. So, it was basically already possible.
---
I'm a Druid Cat DPS because it lets me save groups that have bad pulls and still gets a Rez on the healer. I always heal up the Lock to save the healer's Mana. If the Lock can't use Drain Life or a Healthstone or Health Pots or Food or Bandages or just drink for Mana like another caster, why should the healer stop drinking and cast healing spells and then drink that Mana back again before the next pull? Warlocks are usually life tapping when the healer is drinking and it's not a convenient time for the overall flow of battle.
---
I cannot wait for you to get into raids and start pulling a shit ton of aggro and wiping 40 ppl and pissing them off lol. We'll see how long you keep this mentality
---
I wonder if instead of increasing all the stats on gear to scale with lvls, they just increased the stat gains with lvls so that end game raid gear that took months to get doesn't get replaced with greens almost immediately with a new expansion. Also think that if this happened the DPS increases wouldn't be nearly as drastic between 60-70-80+
---
No, it wasn’t in vanilla. There are already numerous changes in classic.
---
Did he also share healthstones?  I've yet to group with a lock that offers healthstones, and most of them seem to act like I've asked for a kidney if I ask for one.
---
I saw this I was like...wait...wat....
---
I think wikipedia might be a bit more of an attention grabber than a buncha nerds playin games.
---
No problem, dude.
---
There's no warning about it, so I guess people just pick goofy names without realizing that they could get hit with a name change if someone reports it.
---
um yeah but if they started in 2016 like i said they possibly could have, this wont be done for 5-10 years. also thatd be on max graphics settings id imagine.
---
I thought Alt made it capture the current window, not the current screen.
---
You're gonna want all 5 for Anger Management. It's shitty tooltip doesn't mention you actually generate 1 rage every 3 seconds with it, but you do.
---
&gt; Try it with sausage. Pecan smoked venison sausage is the best.
---
You aren't wrong.
---
I'm in STV right now as a horde player and I have to admit I'm jumping every Alliance scum I see.  I love to one shot clothies with Windfury proc + Dispell any kind of bubble they use.  Yesterday a druid and I were litteraly ruining everyone's night. (Incendius)
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
The trees are specifically balanced for you not to get 31 and 21.
---
I really want to play Horde and the absolute only thing that's stopping me is that I enjoy Stormwind and alliance zones more :/
---
How is it leveling a healing Priest in classic so far? Relegated to dungeon groups or is soloing viable?
---
At level 60 when all your gear has an average of +20 healing it won't be useless will it?
---
I am curious of the math - troll warriors have it extra special because they get some bonus regen during combat as well from their racial - so it might actually be some help during instance tanking
---
If he pays for all those accounts, it’s legal
---
First off, a Shaman won't be able to tank raids or any other endgame content simply because their only defensive talent is the one that adds 5% to block chance. They do not have the amazing defensive toolkit that Warriors have. More importantly, much like Paladins, Shamans do not have a taunt and hence will have trouble pulling away some overly zealous rogues and mages who DPS too soon. And of course, they don't have plate armor nor the crazy health pool that Druid bears have.
---
Despite the amazing support provided by Shaman totems, your raid leaders will likely still prefer you play a resto spec healer than a dps since your dps is not great, and even Shaman healers can drop windfury totems. That being said, I don't believe you need to dump all your points into Resto to be a decent healer. You absolutely need 21 points for Nature's Swiftness, but nothing stops you from putting 30 points into Enhancement so that you can still solo outside dungeons. Although that could change if your guild has very few healers and need their healers to be ultra-optimized.
---
In the end, the people you need to ask are your guild leaders. Some are less neurotic than others.
---
So, I leveled primarily through XP farms. With the couple quick easy level places like Ungoro. I always ran with two Mages since they’re AoE is just unparalleled and them being able to cycle Novas was a life saver. Start at 30, working your way through XP farming SM Graveyard&gt;Library&gt;Armory&gt;Cath. Then at 42 start ZF’s fantastic XP farm up to Graves. Then at 52 start BRD’s Jail farm, which is the most boring one, but the easiest. So we wouldn’t get bored, we’d hard farm the Jail for an hour, then go either get an Arena run in, or a full Emp run in for Pre-BIS, then back to Jail farm. Then at 56 start LBRS. LBRS had the best XP farm and the loot is the best as well. 
---
As for builds. I’ve tried a few. First was the drain tank build you’d use for questing, which IMO wasn’t the best for XP farming because all you’re doing in XP farms is AoE, so Hellfire/Rain of Fire. So I tried respeccing to Destro and grabbing all the AoE talents and talents that buff your fire dmg. However don’t get Conflag/Shadowburn because you’re just literally AoE spam and instead of put the points in Demonic Embrace for the Stam and Imp Healthstones and worked down to Fel Dom. Reasoning behind Fel Dom is because you use VW for the AoE pulls. It allows you to toss some curses up and then Hellfire, Sac your VW and continue to HellFire. You’ll be beating the Mages AoE until about BRD and even then, you’ll still be pulling pretty high DMG. 
---
As for your role, just made sure the Healer is always Soulstoned, Tank has a Healthstone at all times and watch your Hellfire spam in your health.
---
Ha a similar experience,  where a whole guild got mad because a character dared roll on an item they thought he shoudlnt have.   Had people sending rude messages and yelling unkind things.  Really turms you off the wow experience.

Just because there are fantasy themes doesn't mean that the world doesn't have rules within itself, and I'm sure one of the "rules" in Azeroth isn't that hair doesn't grow.
---
Stop worrying and look at it as a new start.
---
Sweet! Thanks!
---
I’ve played on JetBlue.
---
Can i give you a tip? Most classes drastically change their gameplay once your out of the lvl 10-20 area.
---
And try out the class youd choose the least.
---
Really found the perfect class for myself that way.
---
Realized ive never played warlock in the past 10 years but when i started to lvl on pservers i realized that im born for being a warlock
---
Omg that makes so much sense now. 😂
---
As long as you don't feel like it's too fast then you're good to go!
---
The main reason there's a lack of tanks is that dps tend to give tanks a rough time.  They complain, they pull extra mobs, and other headaches.  Letting them die is a backdoor way of making them cooperate.  Its not the ideal way of handling people, but thats the way things go.
---
To be fair, what could he have done, stand around in a 10 man raid never completing the quest?
---
&gt;Yes hes a rare in the barrens. Humar the Pridelord.
---
What's wrong with him farming an instanced area? He's not impacting your gameplay. It's not like he's stealing quest mobs or items from you.
---
Just move on and play the game.
---
I don't want your stinkin buff!
---
Ayyyyeeee. That's my server! :D but I play horde...
---
Edit: God, I just want to make a damn paladin so badly
---
I come to Reddit to voice my frustration. I don't take it out on the people. my usual message is something like 'hey could I get a few stacks of water please?' when we get to the dungeon. on more than 1 occasion I have been completely ignored. even saying no would atleast acknowledge my message.
---
How can you need see that its unfair for you to need on an item for your  friend? Go back to retail. Lol jokes
---
He's level 24, as stated in the post.. that's not bad for bfd
---
Please enlighten me, I'm having a hard time figuring out what is wrong with the name Kolache for a RP server.
---
Number 9?
---
Lol okay I saw the same name and loved it. Sad to see yours die. RIP.
---
That's fine as a policy but doesn't have anything to do with what he said. OP and slim's point is that HS costs significantly more rage than what is displayed in the tooltip. It is already quite mediocre damage per rage even ignoring this, but including the rage loss makes it quite terrible DPR and thus worse to use than the alternatives unless you (somehow) have so much rage income that you're using all of the alternatives and still have excess. Which, frankly, you don't.
---
Awesome lockscreen for my computer.
---
Why are you helping the opposite faction?  If anything you should roll Alliance to be a jolly-happy camper who is naive  enough to think your sworn ennemy will help and /wave  at you.
---
WoW is also a RPG wich mean you should at least follow a bit of the logic behind the lore and what your faction stand for.  
---
It's PVP WOW not animal crossing or friend simulator
---
I'm at 33 right now, so far the only pvp I have encountered is one side massively outnumbering the other, or one party noticing a 300hp guy farming and just finishing them off.
---
I have yet to see anyone try and a pick a fight where they have even a slight possibility of losing.
---
As a mage, I agree. Though it is _hard_ not to pull off a pally tank, especially if they don't have an aggro meter. I just deal with it though.
---
Most classes at 60 can. Rogues, hunters, warlocks, mages and even warriors with a bit of effort.
---
Wtf they did to you to act like they are scums of world? The way you described your story made me sick. Show some respect please to the opposite faction, se have feelings too.
---
I'll end a fight with 20ish rage, then I can charge / rend / thunderclap right away, to debuff their swing timer so I can continue without healing more.  Also great for carrying over rage for an easier time using shouts between pulls, so you don't have to do it mid fight.
---
Icy Veins has been wrong about a lot of stuff. Stop accepting things at face value when its easy enough to test yourself.
---
Sunder a few mobs and record the damage differences. Or farm for an hour and record the kill timers. This easily proves my point.
---
It most definitely is, happy to have an opportunity to use it - my usual use is to shout it in the car when there is a bad driver on the road.
---
which quest is that? I didn't see a repeat quest in the main hub.
---
Why do you say that? Just wondering? 
---
I also have herb and skinning currently but didn’t know I could do it in ghost wolf, that’s awesome.
---
id also assume any gear that drops that he could use will go to him lol
---
Lok’tar!
---
Either move and forfeit 2 or 3 days played time or pray for transfer system eventually.

[pay attention](https://i.imgur.com/zc8ivb4.png)
---
Amazing show.  Love that guild name too lol.
---
literally it IS that taxing. Every single tank I know has had an awful time because of this shit. As a healer, I'm just done with dungeons till I'm working on BIS pre-raid, because it's too much of a pain in the ass dealing with the moronic dps.  DPS just want to ZUG ZUG constantly.  There's a reason for the tank shortage, and it's not just because people don't want to tank. It's because they're sick of the shitty experience that has come with it.
---
Chuckles in druid.
---
who decides who gets to use their key?
---
I’m not in my computer to post the macros, but when I get on later I’ll post them to you. But there’s a few. I set Macros that automatically use your highest rank of whatever spell you cast. So you don’t have to move the next ranked up Corruption for example to your actionbars, the macro casts it for you. I use a lot of mouseover macros for a lot of spells. A macro that opens trade with whoever you’re targeting and drops a Healthstone in trade for you, among many more.
---
Same, I went into this pretty cynical and fairly convinced I wouldn't like it. Yeah, no. I'm having a fucking blast.
---
Capitalism is theft in many ways. You really think capitalism is morally just? The primary motivator in capitalism is greed, I don’t understand how you’d think it could be just.
---
This is very true. I charge every horde I see because if I don’t I know they’ll hit me and I can’t charge in combat, making me an easy kill. Horde scum.
---
*casts rank 1 renew*
---
I feel your pain, would never play on an RP server because it's just not my thing but due to the server issues and I think a lot of people joining RP to escape long que times, blizzard should imo offer free transfers to either pvp or pve server from RP.
---
Hyperactive Rogue has died.
---
Oi, it's a two way street. Helping my tauren brother tame a Westfall Buzzard so he can get the screech option for his pet and a pally comes and camps us so we were unable to get the pet.

Old hatreds never die.

It's so funny when once hardcore WoW players become adults and then suddenly become casual players
---
Your mind has already blamed layering, and your post is just looking for support.
---
NO MORE!
---
Judging from that reflection, you're pretty cute! Wanna date me? I'm 3 months clean from cough medicine!
---
But Renew might be good at the end of a wave of healing. Since it’s an instant cast it won’t significantly affect the 5s timer for regeneration and your tank is taking damage constantly, you can offset coming damage with a Renew while keeping your mana regen 5s in your future. 
---
That said, your regen will then need to recover the cost of your Renew in order to get you where you would have been if you hadn’t cast so the efficiency of this strategy would depend on what Renew rank and your Spirit. 
---
Also, Shield might be a better option to fulfill that same purpose (instant cast to offset future damage), depending on your spec.
---
Servers are still layered, so just keep on playing. When blizz decide to stop with layering, and it still feels empty, then you should switch/wait for paid transfers or server merging.
---
Why not both ?
---
Good melee dps should overaggro to help the tank control the mobs and they should never limited dps just for tanks. 
---
Change my mind.
---
Pally's who don't keep buffs up will be sitting around in Stormwind LFG, while everybody else is raiding.
---
Same as those nice guys who go from "Hey would you like to please go on a date with me" to "Fuck you bitch, didnt want you anyway, you're ugly" in an instant lol
---
They already improved the graphics, tho, so #nochanges is full of crap anyways.

I have a pretty solid group of friends playing (about 10 of us currently) so raiding isn’t of the utmost concern just yet. Plus we basically have a raiding group already. But just curious as I have never played a shaman before this, why isn’t it a main raiding spec? Is there something better for that?
---
that means no free water, you arent entitled to QoL spells, i joined as a dps and CCer. But don't open a chest you only did 20% of the work for it belongs to the group, even if they can't open it.

Completely agree, I started on ZT but moved because why bother when it's basically like all the other servers

My name is “Ihaterogues” so obviously a lot of rogues try to gank me. I was making my way down this difficult pass full of monsters In southern Desolace, I’m lvl 36 the mobs were 38-40. Anyways I get to the end to start the quest and this lvl 37 rogue starts trying to gank me.  I’ve gotten pretty good at tanking their stunlocks so I wait it out with HS and Voidwalker sac then feared him into a pack of lvl 38 skeles and watched him die. Felt real good. He also instantly chose to take Rez sickness so that gave me an extra chuckle.

Yep I get it too.

Nah I'm just joking you're great!

Team viewer is for computer to computer remote. You could tab into and out of the teamviewer window just like any other window but it gives you full access to your pc from remote.

Do you use specific binds for the pet basic controls? Also I see you stopped the drain tank build but if we pex solo it's still better right?

Turkey bacon? That’s a thing? European here.

Tell me this is real 😂😂😂

Different time period
---
MoP was a great expansion. Didn't like the setting at all though.
---
Haha I'm glad mate, I'm in the process of making another video now, heres the full video if you're interested: https://youtu.be/ACwX8JsBzMM
---
Alright, well next time I'm soloing I'll check it out.  Am warrior, so been tanking in SM a lot as of late.
---
Just wait it out, blizzard will even servers out eventually. Getting rid of layering eventually (which they said they would do) will definitely help.
---
Yeah the classic design of many classes is very flawed in that regard specially early
---
It’s also why I can’t stand demon hunters when they released 
---
Just auto attack sucks
---
It only bothers me if ur LOSing while I heal I could care less about anything else
---
They expanded the world, your XP and your stats - even just within the confines of Vanilla each released raid/dungeon often changed the gear/stats and what was BiS so most people stopped playing earlier content even within the generation of the game. A gear game has to do something to keep you drooling for gear.
---
In vanilla, I had to use the lowest settings because of my pc. Draw distance was non existent, each enemy looked like they were coming out of stealth haha. Now I’m lucky enough to run on max, I’m not turning that down.
---
False. PvP is so stale because of the lack of spells and abilities. I've played PvP (and a lot of it, hitting Glad in Cata) since vanilla. It honestly improved every expansion. I can't comment from MoP after tho as I stopped really playing. 
---
But when you have such limited spells on each class it limits your choice to basically 4 spells and you only need to react to 4 spells. It's soooo much easier/luck based vs PvP in WoTLK/Cata
---
Supply fixing I guess, by artificially cutting the options people have available to them.
---
What was his name? I'd like to have a shadow word with this player.
---
Both
---
Probably because it's nice to feel like you're working for something rather than just rushing through content to get the next shiny thing.
---
You only want to do this on mobs significantly higher than your level (3+). Glancing blow chance scales according to the difference in your weapon skill and the defense of your target; you have a chance to perform glancing blows against same-level mobs but it is not meaningful enough to make up for the terribly low DPR of heroic strike (including the rage loss). Which is to say, the only time you should really use HS when leveling is when grouped and tanking a mob who significantly outlevels you. But even then the group damage increase of applying *some* sunders is probably superior to the damage increase of landing fewer glances.
---
Idk, I can see it.
---
A lot of games have been watered down for more casual play, replayability mechanics axed for mtx's, online match play made weird with MMR systems that often take dozens more games than needed to be placed in an appropriate bracket, etc.
---
There are still some solid games, but they're mostly single player games that are either builders(where the game is what you make it) or have a great story(in which case it's often really a movie in disguise).  The best stuff is often a rehash of something that happened before 2010, so if you've already played it then version 2.0 isn't often 'more fun'.(though this could be said of WoW Classic, since it's a rerelease...)
---
A lot of games aren't so much fun as they are addictive time wasters or interactive stories today.  I will say that we had more fun with crappy stuff back in the day that we wouldn't have fun with today...but WoWC isn't one of them.
---
I think it was EQ Next where the developer was putting together the pieces for a next gen MMO where players could build the world up and influence the story more...but the game was scrapped because they couldn't make it 'fun' enough - at least not enough to engage millions for multiple solid years, which was the reach that was needed for their goals.  A *high* amount of 'fun' has been missing for me concerning gaming the past several years as well...it's mostly all just 'content for contents sake'.  That includes highly rated stuff like Red Dead or Spider-Man(though I do like me some web slinging).  I'm not saying WoWC is more fun on it's own, but the event of launch definitely puts it up as a top memory on the fun-o-meter.  Trying out a private vanilla server wouldn't be more fun than starting any any dead mmo.
---
I chose ret paladin so I could go back and fourth between good screen and bad screen with minimal repercussions
---
wrote a boatload of unit tests the other day, did all of my STV grind quests too
---
Thanks all
---
Is slam even worth it to use in a tanking rotation? I have it but none of the tanking guides I’ve read have it in their rotation. I mainly use Sunderland, shield block and revenge at this point (mid 30’s warrior) and Demo Shout for aoe
---
Did you tank without a shield? I agree you’re trash.
---
There are 3 kinds of adds in that boss fight. When he spawns elites in his 3rd phase, those definitely can't be cleaved down.
---
"Therapist"
---
He didn't take twitch offline, he took some twitch ingestion servers offline and that knocked off the streamers he was targeting.
---
I got "Smooth pebble" for my wand ammo from gnomer. Is there anything better to get for my wand?
---
rarer than fortnite or GoT fans for sure.
---
Wanna hear something sad, 42 to 60 is longer than it takes to get from 1 to 42.
---
I found a "Wrecked Salvage" fishing pool near STV and saw a member of my faction fishing from it. So, because fishing pools are shareable nodes, and in my mind is an intended function, I decided to fish it up a bit, and got 2 Mithril Bound Trunks from it. I proceeded onwards in search of more fishing spots, only to have a paragraph of a whisper from the guy I was fishing next to essentially calling me a savage, and how he added me to ignore, and would thereafter add me to his guild's blacklist, and that I need to learn respect. 
---
Fishing nodes are shareable gathering nodes for a reason!
---
I hope they don't do BC and come up with some different story telling more wrapped up in the world. Maybe add more raids but no more levels, zones could give gear rewards etc. I'd say 70 is probably the max they could go.
---
There has to definitely be some sort of expansion hopefully it's new content.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Honest question, why were you doing this, what does this do?
---
Every mob does need exactly this. If the tank can hold aggro your job is to NUKE everything quick to save the healers mana. Dots are the most efficient form of dps so EVERYTHING better have full dots. They are less likely to pull aggro and then once everything has full dots then shadowbolt the main target down. Then refresh dots as needed and nuke the main dps target in between. Wanding is TERRIBLE as a warlock. If you are alive you can do better dmg. So do it!
---
Good, now it feels like a mmo
---
Checked at about 3pm Grob vs 6-7pm Bloodsail

Dude, I just found a secret farming method last night that I've never, ever seen in a guide and gets me over 40g an hour at level 30.  (80s-90s per item, 1:00-1:15 per item)
---
You just have to look at the AH and figure it out.
---
Never circle-jerk in an echo chamber.  It sounds awful...
---
im only 45 but i've tested some questing at 42 i think, did half a level and got back to grinding. it's ten times dumber for your brain but I can't stand running around between regions to quests and it certainly is faster. And i kinda like farming in different zones, I just swap spots sometimes to keep it a bit fresh .
---
It is quite easy to get gold at that level. I sold barrens fish for 10 silver a pop.
---
This is very good to know, thanks; I will have to adjust my build
---
I think it was more of a scheme to get more people playing retail. Look at the timing of that BFA discount.
---
And any mob in a raid will be equal or higher level. The purpose of the skill is to use if you are full on rage and have nowhere else to spend it... so in that case it's worth it. Think it's just more useful for tanks though because of that reason
---
Yep, fury warriors also mash the shit out of it once they get decent crit chance and are always near rage cap.
---
surprised you didn't just swim to wetlands and make the run to IF
---
Ok that makes sense, still enjoying so far... need to find me a Sensei!
---
There's a lot of weird circling and backtracking in BRD that you don't normally see in dungeons so if you were trying to full clear it for some reason (why would you though?) it's kind of awkward to navigate.
---
I already think they intended for dungeons to be ran over multiple trips but BRD especially seems like a dungeon where you're meant to pick a destination and stop at that point.
---
Well, Im just so glad you were here to share your opinion.
---
There used to be on both the realm selection screen and on the character creation screen. Not sure if classic still has it or if it was removed at some point but it used to mention the naming policy.
---
The reason it felt so bad and the talents felt like a husk is because they redesigned it for simpletons.  Anyone who played back then and who isn't a die hard fan of retail will tell you that.  If you played back then you can't deny how different that game felt, whether it be the 'everyone gets frees' to the completely dead servers community wise.  The game lacked community, the gameplay was significantly weaker and oversimplified and it was generally failed to keep people's interest, not because the game was "old" but because it was "bad".
---
Now you just have to download ItemToolTipProfessions I believe it's called and then you'll know which white items are actually useful to you in particular
---
WHATS SAW CON?
---
Never seen it here in UK but maybe I didn’t look in the right places.
---
Confirmed.
---
Its weird to say I had a favorite episode but that was totally mine! I just went and found it on Youtube and its actually from Spring of 2005, so I must of caught a re-run of it later on I guess? either way, weird that it was the first thing that turned me onto this game
---
I disagree. A website that you spend maybe a few minutes of your day on goes down and you just leave it and assume an internet issue. You disrupt somebody from doing something that requires the time investment that Wow does and people will notice.
---
Unless youre a hardcore raider commited to every lockout, full consumables, spemt 2k gold on a Nightfall, you wont be taken seriously as ret.
---
PVP is good as ret thoug, just dont tunnelvision damage and remember your buffs can be useful to others
---
Reported for conversing with the enemy!
---
An extra respec costs significantly more than 1g and I do not advise it for something as trivial as Imp HS. The next respect (which you will absolutely end up doing as a warrior) will now cost 5g instead of 1g, so we're 5g in the hole. The 3rd will cost more, etc.
---
Also, the entire point of this thread is that heroic strike is not worth using while leveling except in very narrow circumstances. Improved HS doesn't come close to changing that, and the alternatives are quite valuable.
---
Interesting point, thanks.
---
Used effects instead of affects, I don’t give a shit now
---
Hey all, I’m a lvl 20 priest on Skeram playing on weeknights from around 8pm - 11pm server time (EST) names Ohshiz, shoot me a pm if you wanna quest together
---
Wouldn't know. I don't use that skill.
---
Interesting good to know
---
Fishing is a side profession. You can have fishing, cooking, first aid and two main profession.
---
&gt; So what is heroic strike good for? Just nothing then?
---
It's a rage dump. When you're soloing you don't normally need it, though you can absolutely throw it in if you have rage that's going to decay before you get to your next target (e.g. you're going to need to eat before pulling again and rage will decay before you're done, so no sense in holding it).
---
At higher gear levels, warriors can generate rage fast enough that it's worth using to dump rage instead of capping on it. Protection warriors rarely have rage issues as well, especially in raids, so you can spam the shit out of it then.
---
At 30 it's probably better to stack rage on a single mob to be able to sweeping strike/cleave down 2 at a time.
---
Heh you say that now but I promise it will get annoying having pms all the time lol
---
I never understand macros like this, it feels like a clunky way to play that takes options off the table for you. 
---
You're assuming you're going to be living your life in Defensive stance, fine if you only tank maybe, but why not just bind your stances? It's three buttons.
---
You have **passed* the time so you are now **past** the waiting period.
---
I’m more impressed with the Gold reward
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
All I need is a gif version of this and my life is complete.
---
I feel like cleave has extra utility only if you are smart at conserving your rage. I’m still in button mashing mode and rarely have &gt; 50 rage at any point, but if you’re smart and know when you have enough threat on mobs you can forgo sunder and revenge in favor of cleave near the end of pulls. It’s been hard for me to break the habit of using available rage as soon as it comes up but you can definitely increase your DMG output if you can manage your threat well
---
Your comment is moot. We were discussing realism in a fantasy game, and I was using that hypothetical to highlight the absurdity within your claim of fantasy world “rules” in regard to World of Warcraft.
---
I’ve said it already in this thread, and I’ll say it again here.
---
&gt; “You give a mouse a cookie...”
---
...and then they’re going to want the calendar back. Then retails quest tracker/helper. Then the collections page in the UI. Then titles. Then achievements. Then race changes, WoW tokens, appearance changes, and a virtual shop.
---
“They’re harmless changes,” “They don’t really effect the gameplay,” “They did it for X so why not do it for Y too?”
---
It’s a slippery slope that has no end. Everyone wants something and if they cave to one, others will expect theirs too. We got what we wanted with Classic. The game is perfect as it is and doesn’t need the features that retail added in after vanilla.
---
It’s the same argument Blizzard used in opposition to Classic, reasoning that if they do Classic, then people are going to want TBC, then WOTLK, etc.
---
And you know what? They were right. Every single day there are multiple threads on this subreddit begging for TBC and WOTLK.
---
Obviously Blizzard caved and released Classic, but there was a massive demand for it and in the end, it made business sense to do so with the drive in subscriptions that Classic would bring, and did bring. Adding in barbers to a Classic server does not profit Blizzard in any way whatsoever; they’re not going to lose subs because people can’t change their characters hair. You know what will cost them subs though? Adding in the same QOL changes that people avoid retail for to Classic after boasting “#nochanges”.
---
And act what way? Have I offended you somehow? Did something I say to you justify a personal attack on my personality? If you have a problem with me, I’d like to introduce you to the “Block” feature.
---
Well put. If they added content to classic and go a classic + route. I think people would be surprised
---
Been playing since Vanilla on a high pop realm. Never have I seen areas this overcrowded.
---
Elemental air - 5 silver lol
---
Getting ready for P2W in pvp. 
---
Multiboxer, always hated em as it feels like an unfair advantage by paying extra.
---
Also from one warrior tank to another Battleshout generates much more threat than Demoralizing shout and has a much farther range.
---
usually under 25% hp by then, so easier to tunnel boss during that phase.
---
I really wish they followed a community driven format like OSR. Also I wish level sixty and vanilla stuck around longer. I'm with you guys
---
I would be surprised. Got some mates in the UK working abroad and they havent seen it.
---
It’s more xp, but you also gain more control from quests.
---
It came out when watching the episode would actually be beneficial to you. It was amazing. Paladins didnt know they could have a ranged pull! 
---
The chicken in westfall!

Some people hate feeling weak and in classic you're a weak ass till but you keep lifting till your strong.

Water? WATER?!! WATER?!!!!!!!! Here you go! :)
---
30-35 is a tough cookie and you'll see a lot of people stall around this point. Try not to worry too much; you're not going to miss out by not being 60 last week. Maybe take a 24 hour break to recharge your batteries.
---
What you're experiencing is normal and you will pull through.
---
It’s our revenge for Hillsbrad.
---
You gotta give them Megram centaurs credit though. They let you slaughter over a 100 of them before they make a final decision on hating you. In my head I just have them thinking. Maybe it was an accident. Over and over again lol.
---
Also heres a really good spreadsheet someone did for classic wow mob grinding. [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding\_xp\_grid\_amount\_of\_mobs\_you\_need\_to\_kill/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding_xp_grid_amount_of_mobs_you_need_to_kill/)
---
&gt; It was lazy design. There’s no lazy design in classic.
---
FETCH ME 20 BEAR ASSES!
---
NOW FETCH ME 40 ELDER BEAR ASSES
---
lol, now that is dedication. Bravo.
---
Pornhub has some great videos that you can absolutely immerse yourself in without physically looking at them.
---
I'm low level so this won't last forever, but man I'll tell ya taking the advice I got in the Classic Discord to tank leveling dungeons as 2-hander in Def stance changed my whole tanking experience. Swap around to Sunder everything then hit the main target, easier to keep control than with a shield.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
This isn’t about monitors.
---
But this again boils down to organic storytelling. It was really odd to me, that I was going through all of the different Au Ra tribes in one single quest. It felt more like a thing I have to do in order to make sense of the rest. And one of the tribes, that was important later on as well, didn't really go well with me. But I had to go through it because the story demanded it.
---
In Classic, I can walk away from tribes and factions I don't like. Without any punishment aside from follow up quests or some dungeon quests. My punishment for not caring about them is, that I need to find a different quest hub in my level range. While in FFXIV the punishment is, that I can't progress in the story at all.
---
Instructions unclear, took photo of my keyboard.
---
Depends on how many mobs you have pulled. If you have more than 2 mobs in a pull dot everything. If you only have 1-2 mobs it might not pay to dot them as you won't get full benefit. Insta corruption and agony on the second then just shadowbolt everything down till death. Also depends how strong the mobs are. The longer the fight goes the better dots become. If you know the fights are lasting long then dots are top priority followed by shadowbolting the main target.
---
World of diablo
---
Nice.! Good luck.! Warlock is the most fun class in my opinion. So many different ways to play it.
---
I was about 13 when when I started in Vanilla. At that time I struggled a lot with family and wow was my way of getting away from it all. Playing it now feels so good now that I don't need to deal with that and I can feel like wow is somewhere I can just go to have fun instead of fleeing there.
---
So I should be thinking my player as more of a support fill, like dps or heals depending on what is needed? I haven’t found anyone I can talk to about how I should be playing this character yet. Although I’m having fun, I can already see what you mean, definitely have to drink after nearly every other pull
---
Do you have a link?
---
Nothing wrong with ganking, part of the game. Having said that when it's a clear solo fight about equal level I always like to let them finish eating/drinking so they can power up to 100% and then i'll fight and beat em so it'll demoramalize them. Then I go eat some stuffed crust pizza.
---
Something like this?
---

---
Dipping some paint chips into glue again?
---
why not reach late game with gathering, then when I'm rich and high level just raise super fast the craft prof? it seems super easy to level them later in the game when I can use all the stuff I collected.
---
"Hey there are lots of people here, I bet layering is broken."
---
"Huuh! I'm not blaming layering!"
---
I can honestly say people are MUCH nicer in WoW classic than they ever were in 2004.
---
If multiple people have keys I guess you roll to see
---
Should be after the small inlet/bay I think that starts at Grom'Gol.  That's always been the divide in my head.
---
You son of a bitch...I was really hoping for death!
---
What graphics are you running?
---
So why do you feel like you have advice to offer when you basically just admitted to instance farming from 30-60?  Maybe teach us how to bind hellfire?  
---
Just a salty lock who's server doesnt have instance xp grinding groups.
---
 Heroic Strike is one of your best abilities for Fury and Prot.
---
It uses the special miss% so it's not subject to the DW penalty and it's high threat so good for tanking. 
---
I still use it while leveling Arms since there's not much else to spend your rage on, but it's less valuable and barely used once you get MS.
---
VC doesn't get released until phase 2.
---
Seriously, Such a magical experience.  Better than the first.
---
You should just swim down the coast to Booty Bay, take the boat to Ratchet, run up to Darkshore, take the boat to Menethil Harbour then run to Loch Modan from there. That should be much easier than corpse hopping all the way through Burning Steeps.
---
They'll pop a healthstone or use drain life if they need.
---
I've never played WoW Classic until now and Im loving every minute of it ! Yeet!
---
Drain tanking lock is what im doing to level. Aslong as you have some decent hp/mana management there is very minimal downtime. Lot of classic drain tank guides on the interwebs for you to follow too.
---
They all are
---
haha, I meant this as a reply to the guy below, just now noticed that I top-leveled it.  Oops!
---
Or soulstone.
---
Well, we're dealing with someone that disrupted a game for no apparent reason besides getting attention. This action is not exactly representative of someone smart.
---
&gt;waste money
---
&gt;nice vehicles
---
Weird to insult someone and then compliment them at the same but thanks!
---
Tank is not very good if they make you wait for 3 sunder in leveling dungeon. With one sunder or revenge you have enough as a tank to hold agro pretty much throughout the pull unless there is a significant level differential between you and the mobs or you and the other DPS or both
---
Very much so, but I like helping people and seeing (hearing?) them happy (Weirdo.)  In vanilla heals weren’t really a choice - no heals = no raid.  :)
---
First off sorry that guy was a dick, second go check out the website icy veins or wowhead and look for the classic warlock rotation
---
That's a load of crap. Speed running Dungeons has nothing to do with your ability to raid.
---
I love attunements and they have their place, WildStar took it way too far though.
---
Ya they won't. I know.
---
Let me know how it goes. This could be a game changer
---
Don't ninja. Only need if you need or EVERYONE needs (i.e world drop/mount)

Your dedication has no limits.
---
hard to say i carry int gear to heal on my shammy so i oom fast.. but if i have mage water IDC its free water. But if the lock isnt bringing water and is just dedicated to life tapping? he can get fucked its slowing our group down because i have to drink more often.
---
just say "if you can life tap. you can Drain life too " I had a few locks get mad cause i wouldn't heal when i stated i rather heal tanks than a lock that won't drink. but 85% i say are understanding.
---
So?
---
Thx, but can't find xD
---
&gt;you can't hamstring-kite like you could on private servers.
---
What was different in pservers?
---
You don't need most of the steps. You're describing for pc. The entire process can be done in less than 20 seconds. Why wouldn't reddit be open on the computer? Most people use it on the computer.
---
I made a green haired gnome with a stupid name
---
I love the little fucker
---
Yeah it always feels silly. I throw up my dots, and the mob is already at 75% down. By the time I shoot my shadow bolt, it's at 50%...
---
The guy also told me to use immolate, should I use that too?
---
Basic petattack macro I use is
---
    #showtooltip Immolate
---
    /cast Immolate
---
    /petattack
---
Do the same but replace Immolate with Shadow Bolt, Curse of Agony, and Corruption. It will always use the max rank of what ever spell too.
---
And start the next fight with no rage? I found execute to not be worth it, by the time they are in execute range one auto is enough to finish them anyway so I prefer the rage for the next mob. 
---
I pretty much only execute when my health is low and I am going to be sitting down and eating / bandaging after that mob. 
---
Do you find it worth it?
---
That’s awesome. I love it. I helped a priest learn to heal a bit better, and he messaged me a few days later asking for more tips. Little things like not shielding a tank who needs to generate rage. 
---
#keepclassicwholesome

Get the following stuff from probably somewhere in blackrock depths. Or don't. Whatever.

He must not have gotten every roll, pm me I can help for sure.

Why not try address his point next time?
---
Beer and Meat are used to gain the trust of a Dwarf.
---
What did they do? They chose Horde. wtf kind of question is this? FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
They closed it?
---
This was a toxic group, my first in classic. The dagger in RFK got ninja looted (even though I already had it and would have been fine passing, still shady) and the lock was complaining that I stopped topping him up half way through the dungeon because I was burning through waters. We had a mage in the group I asked him to get water from lol
---
It's like 50% chance
---
Try leveling a warrior, finding groups for me is instantaneous
---
Cheers mate. Appreciate that.
---
It depends on how you fill your time.
---
No bikes on the sidewalk!
---
Yeah. I might just as something to do, but even then probably would just do Hearthstone...
---
1st target Agony, Immolate, and corruption. Then life tap, and tab through mobs putting immolate and corruption on all of them then life tap again. Imo should be worried about meters in classic/dps while leveling. If you ever see him again ask him how his dps is gonna be in naxx. It will be next to nothing.
---
Yeah, it's not really well-known outside the addon-writing community, and not particularly well-documented within either. It's one of those things you just kinda have to pick up.
---
That epic mount is still needed tho. But thanks for thinking of the little man!
---
IKR! The ultimate escape.
---
When I use Life Tap, I don't expect to be healed because I won't use it when I'm at risk of being attacked. When I do use it, I always have a healthstone ready to patch me back up.
---
It's always a little awkward when I am about to use the healthstone after a series of Life Taps and the priest fills my health in the middle of an encounter.
---
Sorry... Thanks
---
Does "Tips appreciated" count as asking?

This is amazing! Just trying to imagine if the whole game was a reflect of this
---
Hunters have a few different things to manage if they want to play at the highest level that they can.
---
Hunters are good for new players because the minimal effort/complexity required to play at a serviceable level, not die when leveling, etc.
---
I’ll second this. When mobs die fast, your damage over time spells don’t get to do a lot of damage. Sounds like you’re doing it right. I would skip on the shadow bolt except for bosses or harder to kill single mobs and wand instead to preserve mana.
---
I wholeheartedly agree, I grew up with world of warcraft and experiences like this remind me of just how much I've missed it over the years. Thanks for taking the time to read it!
---
Haha! That's awesome congratz! What realm do you happen to be on?
---
There are only 3 territories that belong to the horde.
---
Barrens mulgore and durotar.
---
The rest is just infected alliance territory that needs to be purified from undead / dark iron dwarfs
---
thanks! glad you liked it.

Congrats! This was my greatest achievement in OG vanilla. I dont remember the shoutout from a faction leader though, but I was on Horde. That trinket is super cool and super rare for someone to have, so enjoy impressing people!

Hahahaha blizzard done tricked ya

when i told my gf i spent almost $500 on a monitor for 144hz, she almost broke up with me...
---
Yep, learned that now. 
---
Might I ask what a world drop is though? Don’t I‘ve heard of that before
---
Yea that’s interesting I like shaman so far but having a hard time deciding what I want to do, I’d like to go elemental and heals but idk. I’m trying to think long game but also just want to enjoy my time. Idk if healing will do it but worth consideration

No you misunderstand! This is a good thing
---
because wrath was the dumbing down of the game.
---
Start of aoe grindfest dungeons, simple ass tanking... go go go mentality started.. welfare epics.
---
start of the shitty ilvl requirement... making 10 man gear nerfed.. etc..
---
It's make like a tree and get out! You sound like a damn fool when you say that!
---
And it changed. When I played vanilla, VC was Deadmines and DM was Dire Maul. We can have different opinions on it today, but that's how it was.
---
Weren't the meeting stones introduced at the end of vanilla rather than beginning of BC?
---
I could have sworn they were around before I started my blood elf.
---
I cannot believe dude posted this 😂
---
i always laugh when people complain about how simple mages rotation is because of this. If you wanted complex you should roll warrior! good luck holding aggro across multiple enemies!
---
Or he just doesn’t care about money the same way others do. Some people fill their hearts by giving. Remember money is subjective; everyone views it differently.
---
It's cool, I like healing lots and drinking. If they need to, they totally can if they want. As long as my team waits for me to drink up for mana and we're moving along nicely.. It's perfectly fine.
---
Just wait for all the anal jokes.
---
It’s a wider sentiment I’ve seen many times, that was just the most recent example that I happened to respond to. And yes as I said in that thread the dps were being out of order. But I still absolutely disagree with the knee jerk sentiment of so many people in that thread advocating letting them die.
---
When was the weather removed? And why did they choose to remove it? I have very fond memories of sitting in Brill and just watching/listening to the rain. It increases the immersion into the game exponentially.
---
Very peaceful zone, I like to visit the loch before I log off after a long day of questing or grinding mobs but yes I wish more quests were avilable, could think of a few quests that would suit the area.
---
Yeah if you decide to not include other people rolling on it.
---
Actual bandwidth is minimal for an MMO. All you are sending are positions and actions, you can play on 56k if you had such a connection.

VC is Volten Core.
---
Turn shadows down to "Fair".
---
Seems like the old graphics don't look right otherwise, especially night elf areas.
---
If you're blowing through content, you'll never keep up in dps with an equally geared hunter. Your dots take time to ramp up.
---
But the hunter and rogue are also useless aside from damage. You've got blood pact, SS, and health stones to contribute.
---
Also, block that guy.
---
As a professional software developer I can safely confirm that it does NOT.

Zug zug.

It's like getting two birds stoned at once

Ok.  Does that mean you need to correct everyone that calls it DM? no. we know wtf he is talking about.

FWIW, by the time I quit WoW, I had one of every class at various levels.  If you get bored, just hop on another.
---
!remindme 18 hours
---
Oh... well then now I feel prettier than ever.
---
I think this felt especially like an attack cause my character is actually named "Skeletons" lmao
---
You don't even want to get 3-5 sunders up on a non-elite target before it dies - they will have hit zero armor before then anyways. The point is that heroic strike is (deceptively) horrible damage per rage and sunder is a superior use for it. Many players do not understand the opportunity cost of losing out on white swing rage, and many players do not think of sunder armor as a damage (or non-tanking) ability. It's unclear why describing the tooltip of heroic strike or bringing up runner mobs would be relevant input.
---
Also, to be clear: sunder is more of a damage increase on **lower** armor targets. Armor scaling in WoW is roughly linear with slight diminishing returns at high levels.
---
Used to catch rogues all the time by just placing an ice trap behind me and the flagging afk and sitting partially on it

I have Atlas loot.. looking for Atlaslootenhanced
---
That's another thing, community. WoW is more fun if people you know are playing. As much as I like retail and classic now, It would be even more enjoyable if it was a popular enough thing that I knew friends and coworkers and randoms who also played. I didn't play on the same server as everyone at school back I the day, some of us did, but we could all still chat about our experiences regardless.  Even super unpopular expacs like WoD and BfA would probably still have been Good Times if there were tons of folks to play with always. Expac launches rule because of that sense, Classic feels great now in the same way. 
---
It's not just about logging in to play a dated hotbar RPG, people wouldn't wait 6 hours in queue for a single player version of classic ya know. The "best" MMO I the world would still suck to play if no one else was playing too.
---
Ah, the TRUE Classic experience
---
And 50% you will get herpies.
---
The Classic community (and its attitude) is what is going to kill the Classic community, not layering (which is scheduled to go away by the start of phase 2 anyway.)
---
this is what it looks like when neck beard autists use their disability money to buy a computer.
---
I'd recommend Duskwood, I think it's one of the coolest zones for sure. Has a lovely spooky aesthetic.
---
Couldn't figure out how to get to mainland Kalimdor from Teldrassil village after I jumped on the boat from Stormwind over.
---
 Managed to get far enough across the map to die and respawn on the mainland and got the gryphon at darkshore.
---
Yes, clicking the same button over and over again moving from mob to mob is fun to me. What are you gonna do about it?
---
Like the other guy said, not updated for classic. The second link adds in the features you're looking for.
---
This is what I'd like to see honestly. Although I'd be okay if they followed the story through BC/Wrath and then branched off, but even going from classic to something brand new works. 
---
Wind down retail (as if it's not winding down enough on its own) and start fresh. Borrow the mechanics and QOL improvements that worked (LFG, mounts not taking bag space, etc), and drop the stuff that didn't (cross-realm, garrisons/shipyards).
---
Question is what to do with some of the more controversial stuff. Like personally, I loved achievements and having stupid goals to chase during down-time. But I'm sure others would hate to see that come back.

It’s got like a .0001 drop chance so you’re either farming for months or spending a shit load of gold

It's the perfect mouse, you're nuts.
---
As a warlock, I’ve been wearing the same chest since level 10 because it has +6 shadow damage on it, I even found bracers with +7 fire damage and you can bet I’m using them too. The spell damage greens are just so damn juicy, especially at lower levels where other gear barely has stats on it at all.
---
Uneducated horde scum. They'll actually be healing raids.

It's straight out of Mad Max

And the miserable quests and items associated with it

you are confusing Vanilla with Classic. This IS the Classic Experience. Its not vanilla, Vanilla was a time where no one knew what they are doing. now we have speed levelers and premium guides. we didnt have that in this type in 2004 or 2005. its just gone man. its gone. Layering is just a part of the Classic World for now. As is Battle.net, Restore deleted characters, new addons, and a lack of skeletons. and thats okay. The game is still amazing and im having a blast leveling, questing and playing with friends. and does layering stop me? no it hasn't! and it never will! Its a part of The Classic Experience
---
Not intentionally attempting a cleave group ive found a 2h warrior, 2 shamans, a mage and priest to be crazy fast and efficient. Im the warrior and only have to pull out a shield on tough bosses or a when we accidentally agro like 3 packs. The shamans in mail can take hits if they have agro and they can also spot heal. Did ZG with everyone lvl 44-46 full clear and only put my shield on twice. Wind fury + sweeping strikes + cleave/ww is just insane.
---
Mograine! :D
---
The real life pro tip is always in the comments.
---
Keep hearing mixed things about zerker stance, is the crit really worth taking more dmg?
---
Aerodynamics of the bald
---
Sure, but do you see the magnitude of what it will take for that to happen?  Again, only knowing that layers are single digits, that is a substantial number of people who must quit or transfer.  The only thing that keeps people in a game is the community, so many are missing that.  What we have now is far from it.  I don't think people will stay six months with this version of the 'server community'
---
i did this earlier too in STV lol, im alliance i was doin it with an orc rogue
---
Underrated comment
---
Wow I've been MCing people there but never realized it would cause their own guards to attack them if I ran them to TM. Excited to try it!
---
 Yes, if you only ever want to be in Defensive after you charge.
---
And so you've taken all ability to do anything else with Charge off the table- exactly what I was saying about less options. 
---
If you log on, tank a raid, log off then maybe that's fine but if you do anything else it's limiting.
---
Tanking?  No.
---
Just tell the healer to let them die. I am a healer and have done it a bunch as dps like that make my job more difficult than it needs to be.
---
I don't like browsing on my phone, but a lot of people do.
---
I assume that's why the take pictures with their phones.
---
Otherwise.. I don't know.
---
I happily pay extra on the AH for the first aid books to not have to venture to and into Stromgarde.
---
Oh my fucking God, thank you so much. Actually
---
The only thing we have in retail that I wish we had in classic is the new social window for guild chat.  
---
I truly hope this works it’s way into WotLK because that was the peak of enjoyment for me
---
Wait I get like trying to keep everyone rping but they have to have specific names?
---
Ahh, thank you
---
But with git gud i learned to play warlock.
---
I die because i didnt use an ability and i try to figure out how to improve? Ofc you could read a guide but in the end its like chess. You can only master it if you loose and learn from experience.
---
Most questions would be answered within a second if theyd use google.
---
You remember mankirks wife? Guess what the community did back then. But thats even better because once you get bamboozled you learn to think for yourself.
---
Thise people are free to level like that if they like just as others prefer the slower paced standard way of doing dungeons. I mostly run with me as warrior tank, priest healing and rogue, warlock and whatever as dps last one usually alternates between another rogue, lock or mage. Sure exp per hour isn't as good but the group I play with prefer the slower pace.
---
Try some curry powder in there, it's fantastic
---
Being lonely and having an SO, man this person must have it rough.
---
Jut so people don’t get disappointed WoW becomes a grind later. Both in leveling and simply grinding items/gold/mats was a built in gameplay mechanic.
---
true, but i find FF XIV is still the king in useless quest that point you to A, then to B, then back to A, then make you loose your time for nothing just to pad it out
---
Make more gold in 30 minutes handing in shellfish.
---
Yea I reckon tanks should have some kind of passive agro attractor or something
---
I'm in bigglesworth and it seems a lot of horde is. Just what I've noticed
---
I remember this was actually possible if the twink is nearby, dead, while someone else kills the furbolgs. This gives you rep (but no xp) until the mob rep cap is reached. Not sure about feathers but I think there was some way to get it all the way up at 19
---
they didn't layers made queues worse
---
Level 30 is when most of the tourists are going to dip.  Multiple reasons, the quests no longer keep you in a zone and you only get drip fed one or two per zone, with many actually sending you to another zone to do the one intro quest!  And by another zone I mean it's 2 zones away through enemy territory lol.  Then you get to the first real quest hub and start to realize everything you do is going to be contested by the other faction from here on out so soloing is over unless you're a stealth class or over levelled.  Which means grouping and then pvp/ganking/getting ganked while questing which drags out the levels.
---
Now for me that's fun and what I really looked forward to before commiting to classic and it's paying off massively in my enjoyment as I love fighting in STV/Shimmering Flats/Hillsbrad, it's a blast.  But someone who is used the spoon feeding modern era is going to hit the brick wall at 30 and just go "nope not for me I have no idea where to go or what to do and nobody has time for this".
---
Just my feelings, most aren't at 30 yet but yeah it's a different experience once you get there and you'll question your motivation for continuing on.   Which gives a little bit of special credence to other players you see that are 40+ as you know they went through the same shit as you did so they're in it.
---
Yea but just because it is successful and popular with others doesn’t necessarily mean I will enjoy it
---
Next: Gameboy Camera, make it happen!
---
R E M O V E D
---
Imagine taking the time to write all of this instead of just googling to find out that layering is going away in phase 2 anyway
---
I've been enjoying every dungeon on my hunter lol.
---
If you have the twitch app, you can get them super easy
---
Sure but why not have a macro for tanking and then just the regular ability for anything else? That’s what I do
---
I think Shadow Tap is mandatory for levelling, any time you're solo it's such a huge boost to your mana regen.
---
I've gone mostly Shadow with some Disc such as improved shield and wand spec and I've had no problems healing everything. I've run as far as RFK and SM Library.
---
I bought blue light blocking glasses because I was starting to get migraines looking at a screen all day and night
---
EDIT: A fellow Forsaken killed them while I was on a trip to learn how to fish. F
---
Don't forget to tell them early on that they should always focus their damage on the skull.
---
If you noone make a serious mistake in 40 minutes in 4 different dungeons you have it. Which is just simply exauhsting when someone is trying to learn the ins and outs of speedrunning each dungeon. I think putting the first raid behind skill check attuenment was a bad idea.
---
400ms is really good for satellite. man that just gets better every year.
---
I mark If I need a sheep but I have been tanking so long what I do is hit ctrl + v and look at the lowest health bars and focus threat on them mostly because im lazy and half the time no one gives a shit about what you mark anyway.
---
had a rogue take my mark off the healing mob and put in on the mob he was killing last night for instance shit is annoying.
---
I have pretty much only leveled in a group currently level 48 warrior.
---
I am fine with this, I am a druid this time and I have no trouble finding traditional groups as healer or tank.  There are still enough people who prefer old fashioned dungeoning with 1 tank 1 healer and 3 dps
---
nope... writer wouldn't get back to them.   "spoilers"
---
so "tada!"
---
I know the story.
---
Fun fact: that weapon was originally called The Nicker, but was renamed for obvious reasons.
---
Magnitude of what? You have absolutely no fucking clue what you're talking about. 
---
They HAVE to remove layering before phase two for stuff like AQ and to prevent people from layer hopping to kill world bosses. 
---
It isn't even an option. Layering WILL be removed before phase two. SERIOUSLY, 30 seconds on google!
---
They removed this from retail ? Absolutely love when my warlock dies and I go back to my body he has his wand out and it illuminates the ground around his body
---
Thanks for letting me know! Guess mind blast or smite would be the best best to steal that proc.
---
Do you know if a warlock has to get the killing blow during improve drain soul to have that mana regen bonus proc? Would be sweet to double dip on that with my wife.
---
Your looking into Blasted Lands before the Burning Legion invasion. So the area around you is Outland

Something need doing?

It's probably a big deal for me because I had regrets about the class/race I played from vanilla until the middle of WotLK. I've spent so long making sure of my class and race this time that I haven't even played yet and I was subbed on August 26th.
---
I've never levelled an Alliance character past 20. Horde always feels like home. Coming off a 12 year break from this game....walking into Ogrimmar again felt amazing. Welcome!

And that's just the ones that haven't been deleted, I've personally seen at least half a dozen more that are now deleted or delisted.
---
I'm not a fan of the female undead (or Orc) casting animations.  The fact that they're left handed messes with me far more than it should.  It makes my screen feel unbalanced.
---
Male undead have the best casting animations in the game though, hands down.  Only dwarf females with their possessed pigtails come close.
---
Horde has an easier time to quest in Classic its crazy
---
Yes you can run an unbalanced group. That is an option... Ooor, you can play it the way it was meant to be played... That's not an option, that's game design. Blizzard has used a pretty blatantly clear roshambo formula in most of their games. They do this because it makes it harder for the player to fail. It saves the player from themselves. If you've experienced success with this method, good. I'm happy you've found the fun in the game.
---
Is there a fully functional one available yet? The one I found doesn't seem to have the quest arrow yet.
---
"it's not hard, just don't fight more than 1 or 2 things at a time!!" in areas where mobs are closely packed together where if you're not watching around your character at max camera distance in all directions, this can be considered "difficult", not sure what you consider difficult to people that never play games as was stated in the op
---
It won’t
---
Lesser heal becomes obsolete once you have Heal. Varying ranks of heal and greater heal will be used depending on gear, flash heal is an emergency heal so usually it's the best rank you have that you use
---
Not only this, but now you have 15 years worth of information readily available.  Players have much more information to explain how to play the game efficiently, or even the experience of doing so for those who played private servers.  Even experienced players in other MMOs will easily understand why dungeon grinding can be more efficient for leveling.
---
&gt; BUt in retail theres soooo many toxic people.  
---
There are equal numbers of "toxic" people in Classic. The Classic community is just as bad as the community in retail, if not worse. You can see it on this very subreddit, and in-game.
---
You’ll earn less XP per mob but should clear through mobs much quicker making up for that.
---
However, in some cases you’ll lose money as both of your kills will count for quests such as kill 10 boars, if you share via group loot, you’ll get half as much loot to sell, as well as sharing the copper you find on mobs.
---
But if you want to enjoy the levelling experience together then do it. You could just kill double the amount of mobs required as part of a quest to make up for lost copper.
---
This is the real accomplishment, not killing Rags.
---
this is better
---
I leveled with my warrior brother as a priest till around 30. Cause he took a weekend off 😂
---
message me on discord mojokeylay#3999
---
This is the equivalent of new Dark Souls players grinding their head against the Skeleton Graveyard thinking, since this game is known for being hard, this must be what I'm supposed to do.
---
PW:S prevents warriors and druids generating threat.
---
It's a range that lasts from Stockades, through Scarlet Monastary (All wings, although Library is kind of shitty), through ZF, through BRD (Prison area).
---
Streamer culture (And the abuse of 10-man raid AoE spam) is probably a big factor that contributed to this.
---
I had no intention of playing Classic to the degree I am playing it. In my mind I played through Vanilla, I remember how awesome it was and if I did play, I'd just make the exact same character I playing as my main right now. Maybe i'd just play it a little for the nostalgia. 
---
That was over a week ago and I'm now lvl 25, taking my time, reading the quest text. I just completed the class quest for [Verigan's Fist](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6953/verigans-fist) and I had a blast just like I did the first time. Everything accomplished feels more rewarding because I was so much more involved in the process of getting it. 
---
I logged in during the DDOS attack to work on my main in the robo-gnome area and the difference was palpable. The quests were meaningless, blue and yellow, navigating and fighting on the island was easy and boring. Granted I know my retail main is max level and all my gear is 425-440+, enchanted according to the website, and tuned for maximum DPS so normal mobs are practically 1 shot and elite might need me to spend some Holy power. Meh... The moment I could get back on Classic, I was there trying to scrounge up an extra gold so I can buy 2 more spells I couldn't buy the last time I leveled.
---
That maybe how my post is setup casual vs hardcover....however my thoughts are more "super casual" vs RPG. All that wierd goofy stuff gave the game flavor and fun. But then tons of ppl got fulltime jobs and families, or new kids came in and they both wanted absolutely everything in the game with little to no time investment/effort. Or it was "too hard" or "too slow".
---
The point of your class is to fulfill a role or experience a certain side of the game, then Everyone got mobility, stripped away unique spells and abilities.....homogenized everything: A few for the better, but far too many for the worse.
---
TLDR:I work 46+/week, but goddam...... ME WANTIII MO RPG IN ME MMORPG, MEOW!
---
Mankrik
---
I think they already changed spell costs to be identical (same % of base Mana) between ranks before then, so each rank was just a straight upgrade from the last. Maybe wotlk?
---
But I could be wrong, it's just something I feel like I remember
---
I am getting the same issue on Windows. I use Mobile Broadband (4g) in the UK and cannot get past the Realm Selection for over a day now. The IPv6 option doesn't change anything. Anyone got a solution? ;_;
---
Well no. We have a tank deficit because the only viable tanking spec for raids is prot warrior. So most paladins are holy or ret, and druids are resto.
---
Where??
---
&gt; Dumb comment
---
Good work proving how not-toxic we all are.
---
It’s an example of how terrible the economy is for selling anything right now. Those go for quite a bit later in the game once people start to do higher level crafts and enchants
---
If you’re going to wear it, need. If you’re going to sell it, greed. I don’t give a shit who is more deserving, if it’s an upgrade, put it on. Ffs you’ll replace it with a green quest ring in like 5 levels anyway.
---
I’m a lawyer and stare at a screen at work about 12-13 hours a day. The beauty of WoW is salve to my burning eyes. You’ll be fine. Maybe some red eyes, but fine.
---
Lol I have heard 15 years about the things that are going to kill wow, and now it is still so big and popular that a 15 year old mmo released their ORIGINAL version because it is so popular.   Ain't dying anytime soon because Blizzard is pretty good about keeping this product strong.
---
Play the game, invite people you have fun with. Make friendships with other guilds and hawk their good players. We had a huge guild rolling in Wrath, never had to spam trade or general.
---
I never understood this disingenuous argument. You can't be a mage or whatever fantasy archetype in real life and humans in Warcraft have an entire story of their own that distinguishes them from RL humans.
---
Probably sitting on his leg. I do it and my left knee hurts like shit after an hour or so.
---
No, a dick move would be what I used to do in vanilla as a 60 gnome rogue: stealth and go into the fireplace at TM, wait for horde lowbies, gank them or run out gank and run back in. Guards/high level horde try to hit me but it’s evaded because they can’t hit me in the fireplace :)
---
Its called spill over rep. I don't know the % you get from quests
---
I'm 44... I spent 1-29 as fury 2h, 30-42 as arms 2h, 43-44 as fury dw/2h depending on situation.

I would say don't knock it 'til you try it, but you've made up your mind. I came across some math in another post outlining how both builds are effectively equivalent in dps numbers and it gave me the idea to swap over.

I have a Grimlok's Charge (2h polearm form Uldaman) I use for when I need to cleave, Sword of Serenity/Vanquisher's Sword for single target. Sword of Serenity/Shield for tanking.
---
I was doing the Redridge escort quest back in Vanilla and a Skull Tauren Warr comes and Imp Hamstrings me. I watched as the escorted guy died right outside the caves to Orcs. What did the Tauren Warr do? /LoL me the whole time. I made a rude gesture and he literally killed me by shooting me with his gun. I felt so ashamed I logged off for about an hour.
---
The game feels great
---
I stopped playing like a decade ago when I got killed by a boar in my raid gear when tbc launched.
---
The game feels just as good as it did when it first came out. Its awesome seeing druids run into enemies in bear form and start smacking them around.
---
Finally playing that lock I always wanted to roll back in the day.
---
Its like Barrens shit talk never stopped.

I fucken love it

Right I am wearing my red defias mask when not doing dungeons

That's exactly what I do. I run through the marks with my number pad. Pretty sure it goes
---
1 Skull 
---
2 X
---
 3 Square 
---
4 Diamond 
---
5 Circle 
---
6 Moon 
---
7 Triangle 
---
8 Star
---
0 clears target mark.
---
Found the RP PVE player
---
That is hilarious
---
For starters, I didn't see him clearing it. Secondly he was fighting a yellow mob (goretusk) when he came yelling.
---
Talk to your healer and let them die. We are your best friend in dungeons. I always want my tank to control pulls as it makes my job easier.
---
Close, but the initial roll has a higher probability as you add more people.
---
1 - (0.99)^(n*(n-1)^)
---
Where n is number of people rolling.
---
See: birthday paradox
---
OLD AV!!! 
---
I never got to experience that,
---
I hit 60 just as Bc came out
---
Nice.  That's quite a grind. 
---
I had to double check that there weren't titles in classic.  I had started working myself up to get "the insane" again. Probably best that I can't.
---
a dash of curry powder + Sriracha goes in every ramen I make. Seriously make sit so much better
---
That's some gang shit right there lmao
---
The game considers it spamming, which is what matters.
---
Meanwhile it’s making me hate grouping because everyone needs everything in dungeons...can’t get any loot lul
---
Stopping people using trade-chat as LFG is top priority.
---
And people wonder why us PvE’ers made our server choice
---
It's pretty far, yea. Crimson Whelps are pretty close to the Wetlands/Arathi border, but unfortunately it's a good 10 minute run form the border to Hammerfall.
---
Bruh... you chose a server and knew what the consequences were. I could feel for you if you were 45+ but honestly.. just reroll. Paying $25 for a lvl 20 something character is a serious waste of money imho. The game is so fresh that you won’t lose out on anything man. Hundreds of people are retooling here on sulfuras every day. The realm now has a queue when it didn’t last week. The population will level out. Just go reroll on a lower pop server if queuing is such an issue.   
---
     
---
Classicrealminfo.com is a great tool to see population and where to roll if you so worried about end game population. I guarantee my wow account that every si for server will have guilds clearing all content. Remind me in a couple mo this to delete my character if all realms are not clearing MC.   
---
Go play the game. It’s here to stay. You lose nothing but your play time. Your characters aren’t going anywhere. The servers won’t get randomly shut down, you have the rest of your wow career to level up and raid.    
---
All the pservers ive played on since 2011 have ALWAYS had fresh guilds clearing MC/BWl/ZG, so don’t feel like you’re gonna fall behind because literally ALL CONTENT IS VIABLE at 60. It’s not like BFA were last tier is completely irrelevant he moment the next comes out.    
---
You can reroll a hundred times and STILL find a guild that is just beginning to enter MC even when we get to Naxx phase.    
---
Just play the game and have fun.
---
Set cvar nameplatemaxdistance to 4e1
---
You must be a lot of fun at parties
---
That's actually normal.
---
## bruh 😎😎😜😜😫
---
You aren't accounting for the fact that DW allows you to use all BT charges for healing. So it isn't contradictory at all. You kill slightly slower, but you heal fully from each BT.
---
From another post above this comment I posted the following as well:
---
I'm 44... I spent 1-29 as fury 2h, 30-42 as arms 2h, 43-44 as fury dw/2h depending on situation.
---
You get rep with a and because they are the same faction as b then b rep goes up but not as much.
---
This is amazing.
---
Insults are a poor way to engage, at least make them clever or entertaining.  I've yet so see a coherent point against my conclusion.  You cannot have the vanilla community experience with layering.  If you were a part of a vanilla community, you would see this importance.  Have you every had a community in any game that you enjoyed?  If the answer is no, which it likely is, it speaks volumes about you
---
and Stitches is the perfect man. still an abomination.
---
Well said! Personally I didn't really like talking about wow with kids at school back in the day because I no-lifed it by comparison, haha.
---
I did play with my brother and cherish being able to raid with him while he was at college and I was still in middle school.
---
Dude this has had me laughing out loud
---
Yeah I could see that. It’s great in wpvp tho. People never realize they are getting mana burned.
---
You would have to spend a couple thousand gold on Whitemane, every single questing spot has at least 2 mages aoe pulling and bragging about their "big dick pulls" anytime you try to group with them.
---
Lol, people like you...
---
Dont have 2 rings?
---
Roll need if atleast one stat is useful.
---
I ran around with a strength/spirit ring at low lvl as caster and everyone was ok with me rolling need.
---
Imo more stupid to roll greed on an unfilled slot item because others can use it slightly more"
---
yeah idk, maybe
---
Yeah, I always found that to be a weird justification. Imo, the reason female characters tend to be so popular is just that their gear is usually better proportioned and they tend to have good animations in WoW.
---
Thanks I'll try it
---
My worst one has been running SM Library with a Warrior wielding Swinetusk Shank from RFK. I didn't notice this until right before Doan. He passed on multiple items, like leather shoulders with 8Str and 8Sta because it was leather. He was wearing gray mail shoulders. He then needed (and won) the Hypnotic Blade off of Arcanist Doan. He equipped it, said thanks and left group.

Love the texture you created with the brushstrokes

If you think you’re going to be getting a debuff slot for ignite you’re going to have a bad time.

Well it sounds good and I appreciate the time you took to write this, however I am happily locked into Apple’s ecosystem so Linux isn’t even on my radar anymore. If I had a windows PC I would probably give it a go though!
---
I don’t think it’s fair to say villains, both alliance and horde are good and bad.
---
Join a guild with cool people and run with them.
---
Only seen aoe pulls on things like those non elite plants in wc
---
Can Alliance win a 1v1?
---
No, start over and you'll be fine soon.
---
The more you wait, the worse it gets.
---
Paid server transfer don't belong to vanilla and that's not just a silly request for the #Nochange crusade.
---
If you never played real vanilla, you will soon realize that the community comes from having and recognizing the players allover your own server, knowing who they are, how they play and every past interaction you had with them.
---
Paid character migration means having different players that for any reason will transfer from / to another server just cause they feel like dumping money.
---
As a side, but very important note, character transfer open up many more possibilities for ninja looters and for those who wish to steal a whole guild bank.
---
Just no, please
---
One or two posts like this is fine, I don't need to see the same "clever" shit every 5 posts.
---
They arent going to shut them off tomorrow. We don't even have a planned date for phase 2. It could be over 6 months from now. 
---
There's more of a community in current classic than there has been in retail for the past 8 years... so stop being so overly dramatic. 
---
You're complaining for the sake of complaining, when you quite clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
Looks like it was done by a blind autistic kid.
---
What was it changed to?
---
Sign your heals with on the tank with renew, similar to how you sign Mind Blast with SWP
---
Your talking about one of the most group friendly expansions versus the least friendly, sounds like you don't have a clue what your on about.
---
 I guarantee when you were getting off the ground you had to recruit, there would have been a point where you had 2 members and noone wanted to join if you didn't build the community from the ground up, once you have 100 or so members the guild recruitment can stop, but until then there is not a chance you would be able to self sustain.
---
Also, if you want to make alliances in Classic where you need other guilds to make up a full raid group, it's best to NOT steal players from guilds you work with.
---
You basically said "stop doing unobtrusive things and start being an asshole" no thanks.

Oh no the queue times don’t bother me at all. I’m level 40 also. The queue times bothered them and I just stayed cause they absolutely will open up server transfers eventually I just hope it’s soon.

Wouldnt be surprised if they don't do the Boil a Frog method. Reducing layer count slowly in time with population decay and player-base transition to end-game instanced content.

Most probably won't even notice until they say "We are now down to 1 main layer on all servers. "

I stated that in my post.  My point is that it's a difficult task, and needs to happen faster than phase 2.  Counter point to that?  Im genuinely interested, because no one is engaging my points.  Just crap public uni surface skim reading followed by irrelevant points.
---
I think you and I are on the same page just come at it from different angles due to you being a healer and me being a warlock so we are good.
---
And no you dont come off as condescending, your to the point which is appreciated in discussion. Keep it up.
---
Some hoe ass Ally human priest waited for the boat from BB to Ratchet to just about hit the loading screen and MC'd me off the boat. 
---
She has the honor of starting my revenge list.
---
I think most people go horde. I don’t think blizzard could do anything about extreme faction imbalance as it seems like horde usually outnumber alliance on most servers. I doubt they would go as far as to offer faction changes in classic.
---
So you don't want to do this in defensive stance since you mentioned thunderclap and overpower?
---
The bonus stealth you get from Showdowmeld is passive and i've heard that it's about the equivalent of 1 point into Master of Deception talent.
---
However, I played a rogue throughout the end of Vanilla and throughout all of BC, and it was never noticeable to me.  I would still get opened up on by other rogues.  NE are pretty much worst ally rogue race imo.  But their female model and animations are best imo.  So there in lies the choice.
---
sent you a DM, replay to me on Discord if you like

---
Idk, Im asking the same question but I think rellong new hero would destroy the fun, doing the same again, without any connection to the character. I don't think it's healthy in a long run.
---
That’s a bit unfortunate to hear... I guess I’ll have to look up some enhancement builds
---
&gt; The main reason there's a lack of tanks is that dps tend to give tanks a rough time. 
---
People say this but I tanked so so many dungeons and raids in WoW and SWTOR and have no memory of anybody giving me a rough time outside of one SM run in Cata with retarded people. 
---
The simple reason there's a lack of tanks is because it often requires sacrificing personal capability in the game world and requires a higher level of responsibility. Conflict has almost never been something I've seen between tanks and DPS.
---
Duskwood is so dope!
---
This is a CG movie but it's what I think about when this type of scenario comes up. Cartoon style but utterly beautiful. WoW 2 that would look like that would be amazing!

Screw that im happy working on chemicals and burning my eyes with WoW
---
Sulfuras has an excellent balance. Hillsbrad in particular is remarkably balanced
---
&gt; It's faster if the DPS do as much DPS as possible, even if they take a bit of damage in the process. 
---
No, it's faster if the DPS lets the tank tank so the healer doesn't have to refill their entire mana bar after every pull.  You might kill shit like 10% slower, but more than make up for it by being able to do several pulls without a mana break.
---
Deal with it or go back to retail.
---
Ah I see. I’m not very tech savvy so I probably would have screwed it up somehow anyway lol
---
Replying to my 4 day old comment, the truth of which you know nothing about. What a pitiful existence.

You can get a mini dragon as a warlock? Or can you also as a hunter?

I'm not joking. Not matter what the model is, macs are trash when it comes to gaming.

Have literally never had that work for me.

Well fun part is I am not the mage. :)
---
But like I said already  **First come first serve!**
---
And I am not talking about questing people that come along (which didnt happend!) It was straight up FUCK OFF I AM HERE NOW! And those people can go to hell. Swap layers and go elsewhere, but dont try to take the spot when you are second there... Dunno why I get downvoted here, probably all mages that came second and demand the spot then!
---
Sunder is worthless while killing solo. Disregard OP and use HS all you want because you'll never stack sunder in time for it to make a difference. 
---
However Cleave is amazing if you accidentally pull more than 1 enemy
---
Most raids will have more dps warriors than tanks. Don’t overthink it
---
Block chance, mouse over the block skill in the spellbook. Crit chance mouse over agility on your character stats
---
Glad I'm not the only one..
---
Interesting, do you have any proof or source on this? I'll try it later. If it works that way are you suggesting that once you activate heroic strike every offhand hit will be a yellow attack?
---
No. You don't have to RP, just don't interfere or make fun when others are RPing. Your name should sound like someone living in Azeroth, not xLegolasx, Noobkilla or Lolpwned
---
Its actually the other way around, its super hard to get accepted as a raid tank. Raids like lots of dps warriors.
---
Sounds like a Warlock Panini
---
SOMEONE STOLE MY POST ON INSTAGRAM AND GOT MORE LIKES

/TILT
---
Poor guy :(
---
Im not saying you shouldn’t play it, but the unfortunate side effect of vanilla is that not all specs are viable, and some are just downright terrible even with min/Naxx Naxx gear.   
---
It’s more than doable in 5mans and even in raids if you bring a shit ton of mana potions, tunes, and other +mana consumes.    
---
Egregious has a great shaman channel on YouTube and is also the owner of the classic shaman theory crafting discord, if you have more questions or are looking for more info.    
---
The spec is “doable” just not in anyway efficient or even viable.
---
No, it wouldn't ruin it at all.
---
Not him but guessing ElvUI since it looks pretty much the same as the one I had in Legion when using ElvUI
---
Best class in the game it warrior right behind it.
---
This is great.
---
20 of us are irl, I didn't tell you to do shit, just that it's rightfully reportable if you're caught spamming chat.

Holy long walk for a short drink of water.  
---
Like everyone else is saying, it's being removed before p2, and we already know that p1 will be the shortest phase. Chill pill bois.
---
Ribbit indeed.
---
I wonder if it keeps you out of combat if macroed with sap.
---
That's assuming the ip of the CNC is the actual location. Wouldn't be surprised if it's proxied to hell or if CNC commands are routed through bots in the network.
---
Yes, mac is trash, but as said, your computer was built 13 years after this game was released, you'll be fine.
---
I'm so sorry for your loss... This may sound irrelevant but are any of these passings related to WoW? Because my cousin is actually having heart problems for 2 years, due to long inactive gaming sessions I fear...
---
Literally on break.
---
Nice! I've been liking it so far. Really responsive.
---
He's a beginning tank and probably doesn't have TM. Just let him sit in Defensive Stance, 2h or no
---
Wands have a backswing in their timer, which from your comments seems to be the biggest thing you are failing to notice
---
Literally me working in the computer lab at my college. I managed to find a way to fish on my tablet using chrome remote desktop and on screen keyboard, but don't want to overdo it.
---
I'm pretty sure they toned weather down significantly in Cataclysm compared to vanilla weathers, which was also when nights got a lot brighter. 
---
New zones definitely have better effects and lighting, but I don't think they've fixed it for cata zones beyond a couple (Stormwind I remember hearing they specifically were addressing as a "test" a while ago but I don't remember what came of it, might have been nights only).
---
Keep in mind that quite a few of the people who sit there bashing retail 24/7 literally quit the game almost a decade ago and haven't touched it since, they aren't thinking about everything that happened since they quit. Most of them quit in Wrath or Cata from what I can tell. Doesn't make them right, of course.
---
Vanilla collectors edition
---
Anyone who says both are fine has no taste or any idea how game design works. Retail is trash, play classic.
---
brain buffering LAWL made me spit my coffee haha
---
elemental is one of, if not the strongest PvP specs of all classes in terms of damage. Only issue is that you will need to be stacked with crit% to make it work properly, without the  need for elemental mastery, for which you can choose natures swiftness  instead for optimal playing. As a instacast heal is worth alot more than a 100% crit dmg ability when stacked with crit.
---
Healbot at 60, get heal gear then try to get the elemental pieces that no one else wants.
---
elemental is without a doubt one of the most fun specs in the game aswell
---
Playing a rogue, saw that the hit cap is 8-9% in PVE. I’m assuming that is for always hitting yellow abilities from behind on level 63 mobs in raids. Does this mean that hit cap for PvP is lower than that because everyone is level 60 or less?
---
With so many dungon groups you can basicky do them till 60. It's often better xp then questing with a fast party .
---
While farming some turtles outside Tauren mill a warlock decided he was going to try and gank me... 34 warlock vs 28 rogue.  I proceeded to wreck him, then gave him an extra lesson camp for his soul stone.  He ran back to his body, and tried again... so I camped him 3 more times.  Some people don’t learn.
---
I mean if I can heal a dps accidentally pulling 2 extra groups and the tank is struggling to get aggro across the board in full agility gear...I think you'll survive.
---
You haven't been playing WoW for very long if u haven't seen these said in game
---
Fucking fortnight normies will infiltrate us now.
---
I agree with you but about BC, I also quit in wotlk and I enjoyed wotlk but started seeing where it was going when trial of champions came out and that's when i quit. BC was the peak of wow for me. That being said I never played during vanilla and I'm loving classic. Just a couple things I'm bummed about not being in game like summoning stones or guild bank. But small sacrifice to play the game at this point again
---
Great right? Now imagine that sense of wonder 15 years ago as a child/teen.  Crazy.
---
You do?
---
It’s been 2 weeks.. there are no unpopular servers yet. Just because a couple new servers popped up and haven’t been populated by the queue crowd yet, doesn’t mean they are unpopular/dead. Give it time.
---
Well pushback plus no bonus threat = never use for tanking
---
Don’t you mean VC
---
BC is coming back you heard it here first boys
---
Speaking entirely for myself: 
---
I mean, yeah, probably eventually. 
---
I love the community and the feeling of a small tightly populated world. But the gameplay isnt doing it for me. 
---
Nearly hit 30 on my paladin, and I’m still mostly auto-attacking stuff to kill it. Finally caved and googled what I have to look forward to / what attacks I get while leveling.. not much as it turns out, I pretty much already have my lvl 60 raiding rotation.
---
Oh wow, do you have a list of those?
---
Yeah they came with the TBC patch, so effectively vanilla was over.
---
The community is better because we're in the honeymoon period. Just wait until people have to wait an hour to find a dungeon group and then you cant finish it because someone has to leave early or the tank is too undergeared. 
---
The saltiness and toxicity will come just like it does in virtually every online game. It was there in classic WoW too.
---
You mean the bonus attack power doesn't add to every melee attack or what do you mean with 1/5 atks? And is it confirmed in actual wow classic to work the same as on private servers? Since a few but quite important things are different, like the weapon swing timer kiting doesn't work.
---
One of my favorite activities in between SM runs is fearing the alliance as they run up to the armory/cath doors and send them straight into the meat grinder. 
---
But I'm not sorry for it. You know why? Because I know they'll make me pay for it later down the road.
---
Learn LAMP stack and you've got a junior linux position right there.  Easily make 50k+
---
Equal prio.
---
Something that I learned in game markets. If a guy posts something significantly cheaper than you, buy it and sell it at your price.
---
I do that,but now I’m going to stop doing that and heal myself between pulls
---
Yes you can, I'm a solo player. I'm level 42 at the moment due to work commitments slowing me down. I have one wow friend I've played with since EU beta, he's 60 so we're not crossing paths at all. I'm not in a guild.
---
You don't have to feel pressured to join a guild or make friends but you will naturally meet people along the way. You'll think that one guy was nice and later without trying you'll get randomly grouped with him again.
---
Sometimes you land in a group for a dungeon and the rest are all friends and they turn out to be really nice, and then you're just kinda in.
---
But, totally 100% doable solo. Just don't close yourself off from people completely as you never know.
---
Stopped reading after calling yourself an intellectual. Likely the type of person that gets off on having some type of control over others in a vidya game. Loser
---
I've been on plenty of full Mara runs.  You enter through orange, backtrack purple for the satyr, get your key and then do inner Mara as usual.
---
But generally speaking your point stands.  I went and did Ulda up through Grimlock the other day and will go back in another 2 levels at 45 to do Archaedes and finish out the rest of the quests.
---
Hunter runs out of mana sooner than either of you. Unlike the priest, he does not have spirit tap, unlike the mage he doesn't have evocation or mana jewels or self created drinks. Hunter also uses the agility part of this item, whereas you don't.  
---
That being said, it's a lvl 20 ring. At that level nobody has a ring. Anybody using the stats would roll for it and that would be ok.
---
I feel like this is a troll. Please say it's a troll. Someone saying their wow life is ruined because there are people on the server with non-rp names (whatever that means)?
---
Yeh as a shaman myself a couple warriors and a rogue is just crazy quick cleave, the downtime is pretty damn low too as usually only I have to drink haha.
---
/wave’s proper use is to wave goodbye to someone right as you land the killing blow.

---
Level 58.5 Mage.  
---
60 by tonight, already pre BIS farming in LBRS and BRD
---
Wooow that's awesome.
---
Well, if you are going for the true classic experience I guess that would be the way to do it.
---
I did that as well in '05. Gave up when I arrived in Loch Modan *finally* and saw the gate was closed and the guy on the other side wouldn't open saying "It's dangerous in there, you don't wanna go there."  
---
I'm already there you fuck, OPEN THE FUCKING GATE. Had to Hearth back to SW and ask how to complete that quest.  
---
And only then was I told about the tram.   
---
And then a couple of weeks later I found the badlands passage I could have used to *eventually* get there.
---
Personally I can see that getting on my nerves just based on my personality, and honestly I did t even realize the mana inefficiency until it was brought up in this thread. But know that I think about it, I have used SO MUCH consumables, and I’m only like 15 levels in or something.
---
I’ll have to look up egregious and see what he is all about... what spec does he play? I’m assuming all of them haha
---
What? How does someone, other than a blizzard employee, ban people in any of the chat channels?
---
🤣 Gold right here
---
I leveled like five Alliance characters to the mid-teens then decided I was gonna go Horde instead, since I've always been an Alliance player since I started playing in Wrath. Now I'm level 18 on an  Undead Warlock and that's my main... for now lol
---
Again, you aren't engaging my argument.  Do you think community is important?  Do you think we have a strong community now? Do you think layering harms the community?  If you think what we have now is fine, sure, but make that point.  If not, then you must agree that sooner is better, leaving you agreeing with me.
---
What is questie? Am I out of the loop? I just remember where all the quests are for alliance.
---
What a disagrace to the horde you are.
---
This pic gave me Nogg-Aholic vibes
---
That copypasta is in now way shape or form relevant here at all, I have no idea what you're on about.
---
I like 1 point in Improved Charge because that plus Charge rank 2 gives you 15 rage— exactly enough to open with a Sunder Armor before your first melee hits (and easier aggro if tanking a dungeon)
---
haven't played in 12 years and i forgot about the condom. going to start wrappin up mobs
---
what is it typically used to indicate again? if anything?
---
My [favorite](https://i.imgur.com/80P24ON.jpg) is when they kill the entire area 20+ mobs but don't loot them because their bags are full.
---
and they shouldn't.  on one hand it'd be stupid to.  on the other hand it's blizzard so that makes sense.
---
Nothing to report.
---
Which imo is why arms is the spec to be while lvling. Fury is just feels clunky without tactical mastery. Especially as you'd be tanking.
---
Dude I just posted a different thread with the same issue! Actually getting a lot of feedback. Post is Shaman Time!
---
Exactly - the game’s systems have been crafted specifically to create the learning of a team mind. It has noob and educator roles built right in. Leveling up is represented by experience as a currency but the real level up happens within individual players, who can then teach and lead. 
---
We need people doing educator role and unfortunately some people choose to do elitist bigotry because they hate education, and have not walked the path of self actualization.  
---
Thank you for coming here to participate In growing our team mind.
---
I take personal offense when the tank runs off to do massive pulls and I have trouble keeping them in my line of site. Then 0.25 sec before my big heal is finished casting they use a big bandage and fully heal themselves.
---
No one can tell you what you value.
---
Your attitude is what makes it relevant.
---
omg
---
&gt;we all are.
---
The classic community is overwhelmingly awesome. Taking a few asshats to judge the entire community is just stupid. But nice flip.
---
Both are equally unimportant when min-maxing
---
I do actually know how HS works, I've played warrior for quite a few years and through quite a few expansions (including vanilla and classic). We're talking here about making choices of what to use: heroic strike or something else. In situations in which you shouldn't be making that choice (will otherwise rage cap or in particular need of burst threat), of course you use HS. Sunder and (1.5s worth of) a white swing is still more threat even before accounting for things like windfury/HoJ, increased damage dealt by you and group on successive swings, etc.
---
Server transfers had rules but were a paid service that was allowed in actual vanilla/classic wow. It is not against the spirit of classic. It was IN classic.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
You can dance between auto attack hits on any class I think, obviously works better with slow weapons, so it’ll work well with a warrior too.
---
That’s not being sensitive. That’s being a bigot
---
not talking about reddit you rtard
---
This thread: there are many ways to level as warrior.
---
I've grinded over half my levels. Its slower XP but the GPH is higher. It was more useful closer to launch, when objectives were more contested.
---
What server?
---
You could make that easier for you with an addon. I use VanaKoS and it warns me when people nearby are on my kill list which has saved me from quite a few ganks.
---
Tank dungeons. DPS raids.
---
The dungeon scene needs tanks all day every day. Slap on a shield and tank dungeons and you’ll get your pre raid DPS set and then you can DPS raids.
---
Layering isn't being removed until phase 2, the current population is irrelevant.   It's almost like blizzard has infinitely more info than you and planned for this.   If a deadline is missed (layering still being in after p2) then you can start frothing
---
I'll delete this if 10 people also report it as a bug.
---
That was the first thing he said lol. We vowed to do a raid together to confuse as many people as possible.
---
Just lol. You remember a different game than me, right?
---
Also, who cares who wins an AV?
---
You guys must be new. Only about 20% of it is an act. Maybe look up his old room tour and snack box.
---
My good deed for the week was yesterday.  I happened to log in right after the DDOS attack yesterday, while a lot of people were just coming on.  Lots of people on flight paths died when the server went down, so I rezzed every corpse in Stonetalon that I could find on my way to my quests.  Probably a dozen or so.
---
You cant rename your pets so its luck to get something like this.
---
Because intermittent reinforcement is more alluring and addictive than explicit arduousness.
---
Even at 50+ I still think a 700 mortal strike will do huge bleed dmg but I forget it's the same as a 28 hamstring crit.
---
Ooooooorrr... 
---
Here's a much easier way: Just bind your weapon sets. So you can put on a S+S when you want to and put on a 2h when you want.
---
"Don't bake it into every move" is a copout answer. 
---
Mixing up stance swaps with weapon swaps is making yourself much clunker and less efficient than just binding your weapon sets. Hell, it's not like you're gonna be changing your sets that often, it's not a difficult binding. And Warriors aren't even close to the highest skill ceiling in Vanilla, there's almost nothing to "micromanage".
---
I probably shouldnt post this here, but if you're every getting invaded by a mage at your aoe spot or they're trying to contest you. 
---
Follow them around and position yourself so your frost nova hits half of the mobs they're trying to aoe.
---
Pretty much will get them killed or force them to reset. 
---
A few unfriendly novas and they'll leave you alone or try to layer.
---
or just use multiple bars and use your bar #2 when your tanking lmao
---
&gt;There is an actual way to release an addon for classic, and Twitch will mark then as such.
---
For some add-ons, yes, they will be marked for Classic. But some developers have elected to release one version that is made for both Classic and retail, and it won't be marked in Twitch as a Classic add-on, even though it is made for Classic. Just wanted to clear things up for OP, since that had confused me at first.
---
Not sure why you got downvotes, lightshot is a really great app for Windows
---
I did the overseer quest in searing gorge a couple days ago with an alliance hunter and priest. Shoutout to Melt - Incendius and the priest for being good dudes. My lock greatly appreciated it.
---
Eramikus I killed numerous times.  Archaedes I killed once and we had a bored 60 in our group. Those adds really put a lot of stress on the healer's mana.  In vanilla anyway, pservers was a different story.  But I would argue that the Hakkar event in ST is harder than Eranikus.  He is one of the few wipeable dungeon bosses though.
---
I hit a point on my 24 warlock where I keep flying back and forth to different places that I hate to level up in. Dont know what to do
---
&gt;first come first serve
---
Yeah I'm gonna say no to that one boss. This isn't the front seat of Mom's car on a trip to the store.
---
Layers are absolutely about player cap.  Population cap is written into the game code, as it is the function that determines mob and resource spawn.  The stated reason for layers is to avoid dead realms as players drop, where have they said layers have nothing to do with pop cap?  It's been the complete opposite, your point makes no sense.
---
My point is that layers need to go faster.  I don't think the 'natural fade' of layers will happen organically, nor at the correct rate.
---
Years ago I was a little dwarf in the 20s range  who found his way into the Barrens, I fell off a cliff into the ocean and ended up swimming to Tanaris.
---
Warriors are the most popular class lol
---
Technically it does but since the game is fullscreen I guess it's technically true
---
I’m hosting a LAN party right now with 12 of us all playing together. We all just reported this as a bug.
---
Wait you can manage to figure out where to alter your files but you're too smoothbrain to use PrintScreen?
---
No I don't watch him. Don't like his act tbh. Yeah like I said though he started off dirty but now it's an act. It's his money maker.
---
sharex is life
---
There is no option but to rush leveling in retail.  Do a bg and you’ll get a couple levels.  Do a dungeon and you get a couple levels.  You level so fast they had to make the zones level with you; now you play through a few zones and ignore most of the world they created.  Professions, while completely useless, also give you xp.  
---
No one has a choice but to rush leveling, because blizz doesn’t give you one in retail.
---
I mean...its already in...so....
---
Everyone seems to be getting all creative since classic was released. I'm more than open to trying all these things I read but they are inevitable very equal to what I've been doing...
---
That sounds really cool. Thanks for the tip!
---
Aku Mai is only a level 25 elite, right?
---
I audibly laughed at your second line, you must have been freaking awful lol.
---
You're my hero
---
Interesting. Guess I have just been overthinking things. For raids you go fury over arms correct?
---
I grinded the VAST majority of my 1-60 experience on vanilla, definitely doable just boring.
---
I spent all night on retail farming archaeology crates in pandaria. Must’ve been nearly 100 crates before I took them to the vendor to exchange for tolvir fragments. In my fatigued state I managed to trade nearly every single crate for TROLL fragments. I must’ve glazed over the T and went for it.. I feel your pain brother..
---
As long as everyone is on the same page it doesnt really matter. If you wanna do a zerg group advertise it as such and make sure everyone is on the same page. Otherwise run it like a traditional dungeon. People level/play differently and thats okay.
---
What isnt okay is expecting everyone to want/know how to do it that way and get toxic if they dont (like the people in OP's post). Dont be that guy.
---
more people playing the same realms = longer people are willing to wait in queues to play together on those realms with everyone else
---
KSP would like a word
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Nothing like getting DCed because your sister wanted to use the phone...
---
sharex will also upload to a file sharing and copy link to clipboard
---
this is exactly what I knew would happen to me, so instead, I did this all on a pserver a few months ago lol
---
Lvl 30 i think.
---
f that game bro. sorry if i leaked it out to them :(
---
&gt;Guessing with ~~layers~~ *everyone basically still leveling* its easier. When ~~layers are gone and~~ a lot of 60s are around its gonna be hell
---
THIS. I’ve gained so much gold.
---
That sounds really close to exploiting to me. Besides, what's it save, a tenth the cost?
---
Hamstring kite is so goddamn tedious and annoying anyway. I tried it for one level and you just end up pulling everything.
---
Will you now? 😏
---
It's not an execution thing it's an attitude thing.
---
"Only" deals weapon damage?
---
It's one of only two instant weapon damage abilities you're gonna get. What are you doing in Battle Stance or Defensive that's more efficient than WW? 
---
Charge+Auto Swing+MS+WW+Auto Swing should bring a mob to execute range or close, and Berserker stance is where your best tools are, Pummel and Intercept.
---
Wands are working weird in general. They totally botched that.
---
I ceded this in my post, not sure how this is a counter point.  I'm not complaining, love the game also, but the vanilla community experience is missing.  Do you think community is important?  Do you feel what we have now is a solid community base?
---
I did say sometimes.
---
Are you the one that I caught stabbig my pallys back in a tent while I was afk for a short while? That I then proceeded to crit to seven hells? Props for attacking 1v1.
---
Time and time again i feel like going back to current wow and then i look at all the content there and the lack of community and i just zone out.
---
Cannot get invested at all.
---
Yeah, my addon is literally like that, you still need to mark it as Classic or the game will keep saying that the addon is not up-to-date because the addon is listing another version.
---
You're not missing anything
---
Why would you need vm?  If I recall you just need to copy the install folder. Run in windowed mode.
---
The trick with that is not to farm reagents for robe themselves, but the gold to buy it on AH. It literally saves you hours.
---
Yeah the hills are really annoying especially the one by the beach
---
*laughs in mage*
---
That script is trying to put everything in your bags not just your weapon.  Are your bags really full?  If so it’s probably at capacity.  
---
Weapon slot is 16.  So maybe try
---
/script
---
PickUpInventoryItem(16);
---
PutItemInBackpack();
---
end
---
Please check my spelling.
---
what did ya do for gold? AoE farming? I'm level 32 and only have about 15g, i definitely don't think im on pace.
---
Yeah, people were up in arms about me naming my character Pancakes before launch. Now, compared to "Johnathanwickx" my cheeky alias is looking pretty good, ain't it?
---
Here's what you do(im a war tank)
---
First hit&gt; Demo shout &gt; Cleave &gt; Revenge/Taunt as instant threat pull. It's really not that hard. If it's a big pull and theres alot of AoE, all I do is Demo Shout and Shield block to mitigate more damage. 
---
All these streamers tanking on battle/fury stance can never keep aggro, People take streamers way too seriously.
---
&gt; The people here wanted classic for the community
---
And this is part of the community, welcome to what vanilla was like! :)
---
&gt;But if you’re dying to a spider, you’re damn skippy ima jump on that nope and save your repair bill.
---
