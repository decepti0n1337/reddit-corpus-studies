Strange that Blizzard released a patch specifically to limit Spy's functionality, despite nothing being wrong with it...
---
It is filtered by faction because in the classic pvp system you compete against your own faction when it comes to standings. It therefor is illogical to show anyone but your own faction, otherwise you would end up with for example, 2 people having standing 5 etc.
---
In before all the horde players complain about exaggerating server imbalance - you only have yourselves to blame.
---
You do not need greater fire protection potion as a mage in MC that's literally throwing money down the toilet
---
&gt;	your’re
---

---
🤔
---
You can do it too. You choose not to. 
---
It isn’t cheating.
---
How? Teach me, sempai
---
Can someone explain to me what spy does?
---
Plus gear now is a lot better than back when MC was the current raid.
---
Battle chicken
---
You sir are a poet
---
somehow you posted a link to the preview of your image, and not the image itself.
---
This reads like an anti-vaxxer post. I take it for satire.
---
Sounds like people shouldn't highly recommend it
---
Correction. Priests get spell power from spirit when they spec more than 20 points into holy. The reason spirit is good for priests when levelling has nothing to do with why it is good for holy specced healing.
---
Spectator mobs up on the ledge. You can attack them but they don’t fight beck and don’t die. Once you do a dm north run just stick around, don’t get the king buff and attack away.
---
The phases were changed based on feedback from the community, some of that feedback was separation of bg's and honor, like I was in vanilla.
---
Cheating by your definition. Since this is blizzards game they define cheating.  It's like saying the golden gun in golden eye was cheating because it kill you in 1 shot.
---
Wow, I love you
---
Who in their right mind is longing for supression room? x_X
---
What’s the best way to bait counter spell? Have had a lot of trouble with the few mages I’ve engaged
---
TBF, i didnt know it was against the ToS until this post because it seems so stupid.
---
I switched from a geared 60 and leveled a new 60 on a pve server. The people are overall way more relaxed and the whole experience is what more relaxing. With battlegrounds coming it's really a wonderful place.
---
Who does that at such a low level? Lol, hell just get a gathering profession and quest. My druid alt had 50g before level 30.
---
So what? Some fights you're more likely to need one or the other, and either way you should have pots in case your gems are on cooldown.
---
Any spec that does not include mortal strike and tactical mastery is a terrible spec.
---
In the current world pvp heavy environment, where would you recommend grinding as a 53 fury warrior?
---
Haha streets ahead. Community was a great show
---
If you're rank 2 then you have anywhere from 2000 to 4999 RP and your position in the bar can help narrow that down to roughly the number you are looking for
---
Well I don't give a FUCK about Blizzard's revenue, so I think it should be a bannable offence.
---
My favorite fight in BWL back in the day.. unfortunately with this itemization, talents, and addons.. it will be a joke just like MC has been.
---
Really depends. Healing a group that knows what they're doing is easy, practically braindead unless there's a mechanic you have to do.
---
Healing a group of people that don't know how to play or are undergeared can be tough sometimes.
---
Where do people get these server cap numbers from?  Has there ever been a blue post stating the cap that I missed, or is this an arbitrary number pulled out of someone's rectum?
---
True, but how would you contest someone farming in an area with say 10 accounts, from your own faction? Most farming in Classic is difficult enough with a few others contesting. 
---
Im just saying I don't understand why it's allowed, other then blizz making more $$. But to each their own. It's not my money.
---
At 60, several of these mini bosses can be soloed/farmed on select jobs. Notice the OP is not in a group
---
No, it's not. And his names not Shirley.
---
Lmao
---
Not only that but the disease cleanse literally stays on and cleanses multiple diseases
---
Super cheap, at least on Mankrik it would be.
---
cool story bro
---
Whats the population ratio there ? Perhaps you should wait for Bgs before making a jump? Far Less ppl will farm honor in world considering bgs are superior
---
Fucking perception is so OP smh
---
This is so wrong. Spells landing are not determined the second you press a key. You try casting a SWP on a stealthed rogue as they walk past you and watch it not apply a dot because the rogue walked far enough away before it applies.
---
That's a fact. Alliance outnumbers Horde by a fair margin on Zandalar Tribe, and that's really showing now in the initial madness phase of PVP before the the newness factor wears off, battlegrounds are introduced, and many people start considering world PVP to be a grind.
---
But sometimes horde dominates locally. Possibly because alliance is too busy camping our inns, flightpaths, high-level dungeon entrances, etc.
---
It does lead to black humour, like our "who died the fewest times reaching UBRS" in a visit tonight. (Answer: me, feral druid with improved stealth, and I only died twice moving in stealth all the way from the Burning Steppes flightpath, proving that moving at 60% of normal speed the entire distance was a lot faster than trying to move at 160% normal speed without stealth from either Thorium Point, Kargath, or Burning Steppes)
---
48 is more than fine to heal ST. I did it around OPs level specced shadow.
---
So basically you want sharding from retail... No classic is about community and knowing the players. If you want sharding go to retail with that bs.
---
Except it’s an analogy, and it’s not perfect - drawing that conclusion from my analogy is a bit silly. 
---
Unfortunately the add on is not a bug, it just uses the combat log for all its information.
---
Two back to back bindings. Hosted my own pug for it against the wishes of my guild.
---
Left them two days ago because they prefer running a loot factory rather than a guild.
---
Had a strat UD run be cancelled halfway through by the tank and two other dps that were in the same guild because a BOE dropped and they didn't win it.
---
Multiboxers are World of Warcraft's "whales", sadly no chance of it being banned. I don't really care as its so rare to encounter a multiboxer, and they are usually just doing their own thing.
---
I've heard of a mythical macro that orders your warlock pet to follow around stealthed rogues or druids if you are unable to see them. Is this a thing? Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
---
if you swim up next to it and into the side of it as its starts moving the back corner will catch you and pull you along, you just stick to it 
---
you can kinda tell in these screenshots

If your bar is half filled youd be sitting at 3500 RP. 3/4 filled would be 4250 etc.
---
Ok what exactly is the PvP chat, i tried "wPvP" or just "PvP" but these channels are empty lol
---
This was definitely not what my pvp server was like, lmao
---
The wand was blue from boss so would use, still lost the roll on thst and 2 epics haha
---
&gt;It's the little thongs.
---
Yep, not the big ones. Absolutely agree
---
Burnout, burnout, burnout. I love this game intensely, I really do -  but at the moment simply logging on and doing anything feels a massive chore regardless of leveling alts/dungeons on my main/PVPing or any combination. Can anyone with their personal thoughts chime in with their experiences with burnout during classic's release and what helped them approach the game with some nenewed motivation? or is it the simple case playing something else until the desire to play comes back?
---
I hate raid.io on retail. I mythic raided on a weekly basis but could never get into a damn 10 key because I'd only run it once a week for a chest.
---
If you are remotely decent, Onyxia and vael are not similar at all
---
No problem, I've thrown up a new post with more accurate peak data on it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e09qsz/alliance\_refugees\_accurate\_population\_faction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e09qsz/alliance_refugees_accurate_population_faction/) 
---
Enjoying Bloodfang so far, feels MUCH nicer. My character name is Razzle and I was formerly in Legendary (kinda gutted to have to leave them) but it's great to be able to walk around the world and not get ganked. There's still some camping and ganking happening but it's an annoyance rather than game-ruining thing, which is kinda what I wanted from a PVP server. So no regrets so far!
---
Earthshaker has less Alliance and more Horde than Bloodfang, but it's still much better than Flamelash in terms of balance.
---
Our server has a guild that gave the Rag eye to a warrior. He ended up leaving the guild before some scheduled crafting event and joined a rival guild and turned his hammer legendary after. Apparently the guy was in it for the long con. Was an officer, made friends with a lot in the guild, the whole thing. Had 0 expectation he was going to ditch guild and run before giving him the eye and right up to crafting it.
---
I remember his reasoning being pretty fucking stupid but at least the guy is owning up to being a pos.
---
;)
---
There are plenty of fantastic guild who will do it fast.  There are also shitloads of guild who are doing MC easily who will struggle at parts of BWL.
---
Got a blue sinew after 5 kills into my first try at farming it.
---
I do not disagree with what you have written. As a lock who is capable of farming gold better than other classes, any gold gained from professions isn't the pinnacle of beneficial for BGs. A BOP item from the tradeskill is beneficial, BOEs and things you can sell are not if you make your gold somewhere else. Yes 30g a day is nice with minimal effort, but locks can do sweet things like mara runs and fear kiting to really kick up the farm capacity.
---
The average person isn't going to be a main tank in a world first progression raiding guild. Unless you're doing that pick whatever race you want.
---
Ohh godd....
---
I just got the recipe transmute undead&gt;water for 400g.
---
She always reagros me after pot either i go soft dps and don't get aggro at all or i die.Pot now seems like a waste of 2g ..Well perhaps not cause i can reposition and die north and save some teammates
---
Prostitution.
---
&gt; I didn't ignore anything in your post, what the fuck are you talking about?
---
Feel free to back and read it again if you're struggling.
---
&gt; I literally just offered a take on multiboxing and you've been the one raging at me saying I can't have my own opinion and that I'm "self-important" if I do.
---
Only one of is raging mate, and it's not me.
---
&gt; So you claim I ignored part of your post while you didn't even read the part where I said that it's pay-to-win? 
---
Pay to win what exactly? Please, outline to me how they "paid to win". When they hand money over to blizzard, what items and gold are given to them? How do they win? What do they win? What is it that multiboxers get that makes you so mad?
---
Nothing different than dueling in front of the gates.
---
Thank you!!
---
/Y LOOT THAT DINOSAUR PLEASE!

Ice daddy like

You can try to win by using a grenade after the blink to get a stun off

I crunched a bunch of numbers and got accurate data on the transfer servers, which I posted up here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e09qsz/alliance\_refugees\_accurate\_population\_faction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e09qsz/alliance_refugees_accurate_population_faction/) 
---
Earthshaker is better than 40/60 and it has less people on it so you'll get camped less, so you definitely could transfer there. Bloodfang seems a better choice though.
---
oh man this. I get overwhelmed by a sense of anxiety looking at the guild I'm in roster of super kitted out gear and eternally worry about how far behind I am and how all the time I've put in the game still means I'm behind everyone else. Goddamn it I play video games to stop comparing myself to other people! XD
---
If the mage is even half decent you'll get shit on.
---
IMO opening with cheap shot and then instantly gouging so they can't blink, then try to get back into stealth to have some CPs built. 
---
Open again with cs and try to predict the blink with a nade so you can get to them to do damage. It's real tough without prep.
---
FAPs will help immensely as well.
---
found the huntard that's taking bis loot of melee!!
---
Richard, is that you?
---
Am I the only one who doesn’t like this ring as a spriest?
---
Could be
---
Even more unpopular opinion: RELEASE BATTLEGROUNDS NOW
---
&gt; Data was collected between 7.30pm and 8.00pm server time using the CensusPlusClassic add-on, so should be 100% accurate.
---
Is this supposed to be sarcasm?
---
Yep or take a flight path and then go afk.  Come back you you are at your destination and still alive!
---
Hey, my cat hates it when I sit in one place for several hours ignoring her.
---
You can.
---
Just not with me.
---
Cool! Haven’t flown with SAS on longer flights. Have you killed Onyxia on any of those flights though?
---
Rag Submerges at 3 minutes and have about 1.1m health.
---
Vael has about 1m and will hit the first tank with BA at 45secs and he will die at 60.
---
Logs show there are about 10 guilds who can kill rag in under a minute.  Essence of the red will speed up people, but it won't be some universal thing all guilds can do.
---
Yeah princess quest is one, and the band of ruination is another good one like u listed
---
Still gotta sell them. I usually find that annoying and stressful. It’s OK if u undercut heavily but that does not exactly feel great.
---
A sub which has enough shitposts. You can enjoy being a carebear without telling everyone. Just sounds like you're trying to convince yourself it was the right choice.

Actually it respawns regardless of whether you loot it or not it will despawn after a certain amount of time and the respawn timer is based off when its first opened.
---
I mean I don't know for sure, just my anecdote
---
These days leaderboards have been actively repressed in all Blizzard games.  It would be surprising to see them release one.
---
Is it not worth blinding on the blink?
---
I'd love to make closer friends with my guildies and try and be more active, but I suffer with aspergers and just hopping into a chat and trying to make a good impression even through gameplay (I swear when no one is watching me I play like a god but the second I'm in a group I become a ditzy motherfucker XD) just worries me something terrible. Which is a delicious irony considering that wow is through and through a social game but you know, just living it up a day at a time
---
Why would it be sarcasm? It does a manually-triggered /who on every race / class / level combo in the game, painstakingly breaking the names down by letter if there's more than 50 characters (the /who limit) for any combination. Took me ages to collect it all.
---
Congrats on all your success in the world.....of Warcraft.
---
Does everything resist it?  I mean, it's been a long time, so I wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong.  But I remember stacking ignites on golemag.  Could have just as easily been something else.
---
As a Druid, I approve this message.
---
&gt; Feel free to back and read it again if you're struggling.

I did go back and read it.

Feel free to use your big boy words and tell me what you think I missed.

&gt; Only one of is raging mate, and it's not me.
---
"Why are you so angry?" or a variation is probably the most obvious calling card of a troll.  I literally just gave my opinion on multiboxing and you've been calling me "mad" ever since.  Grow up.
---
&gt; Pay to win what exactly? Please, outline to me how they "paid to win". When they hand money over to blizzard, what items and gold are given to them? How do they win? What do they win? What is it that multiboxers get that makes you so mad? 
---
You really need it explained that five characters are stronger than one?  Really?
---
As a rogue I hate it... it use it...
---
That sounds pretty good actually.  I'll try that.
---
I’m a healer usually the ranges dps pick up holy waters
---
Fuck multi-boxers.
---
All of them. Joined at the end of bc so it's all new to me
---
I'm rolled on a PvE server. 
---
Yesterday in MC I was looking at some guilty and was confused by there name. Then I realised the Grunt in front of their name was a rank. 
---
Oh yeah, I thought, wpvp is in so maybe I'll try that this week.
---
Well, yes, it is. The only person that might get anything from that is the OP - "oh, hey, there's someone who thinks the way I do, cool I guess"
---
For everyone else it's a useless clutter. So. Downvoted to bury it down as it should be. That doesn't prevent OP from reading it, it just makes it hidden for general people if there's something actually more worthy to be seen.
---
If any of you read anything about how Reddit works, you wouldn't be so butthurt by seeing negative numbers next to your comments. 
---
Upvotes = something relevant to the discussion, I want people to see this.  
---
Downvotes = something useless or irrelevant, no point of this being at top and seen, let's bury it down to make space for upvoted stuff.
---
The fact that a lot of you think your comment karma is somehow linked to how much of a person you are and that people downvoting you basically want you dead just speaks about how you don't understand the purpose of voting. 
---
It's. To. Keep. The. Discussion. On. Point.
---
Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Btw do you know how to easily communicate that you get the reference, think that comment is on point and cool and high five that person? By upvoting it. Or we could also have 300 comments of "cool", "this" and "oh yeah, nice". What do you think is more appropriate?
---
I bet you also failed to realize absorbing the entire fire bomb keeps you from being launched in the air meaning you are saving healers mana on heals and getting more dps out.
---
Thanks for saving me some money. As #1 Alliance ganker you're the single biggest contributor to me not playing the game right now, and thus saving money.
---
They are assuming right, then.
---
I thought you were in my guild at first. Same story: annoying female officer (hpriest) that commands attention on discord and with loot, and everything else. Here's the difference, our guild leader was one of our best friends but he's on some weird power trip, strange rules, no one is allowed to ginvite... So we go to MC, my boyfriend asks him to bring along his brother, level 58 priest in greens, but we really needed the extra heals so we bring him. Embarrassingly out-heals that priest chick and continues to for the next couple of weeks.  
---
Fast forward, we're in MC again, brother is 60 now, still topping charts. Eye drops off domo, all priest free roll per prior loot agreement. Brother wins, and our friend (gleader) goes into private discord channel with priest chick and one other officer. They come back and say the female is getting the eye; queue discord and chat outrage. I think more than half the raid was on the side of the person that actually won the in game /roll but all of the "loot council" officers wanted the girl to have it. For several minutes they stood around the corpse arguing, in the end, brother got it presumably because some raiders were upset enough that they threatened to leave. (Wasted everyone's time because she could have easily gotten the thing next week, it dropped 4 weeks in a row and they are selling it now.)
---
A half-hour later, gleader whispers brother: "I really went out of my way for you to get that, you should be thanking me, don't ever disrespect me again." Brother responds something along the lines of "yeah, went out of your way for an item that I WON fair and square." Promptly kicks both brothers, and three of our other RL friends who were also raiding, which then prompts a couple of others to leave out of disgust. Thus begun their troubles of trying to PUG and inability to get people to return next week because of their BS loot rules. They allowed me to stay, hoping I would heal for them on my pally, I instead raided with my bf in his new guild. Several people called me out in gchat "why aren't you raiding with YOUR guild" (didn't realize I couldn't stay in a guild for the friends and community and that I had to raid or leave) to which I explain that raiding together has become one of our "date nights" that I wouldn't give up even for all the gear in the world. So gleader gets on his "anon" account to bad mouth me, says in gchat "you have been convicted of treason, the penalty is death. any last words?" No private messages from him or any officers, just straight salt and a boot.  
---
The immaturity that loot brings out is astounding. What really shocked me was that he was willing to do this to his real friends all because of his delusional thoughts of a fantasy island guild where he is supreme. Now the guy still tries to come in our discord and ask us to help him do things in WoW and other games. C'mon man...  
---
Side note: if you are looking for a guild on Fairbanks, always ask other members (not officers!) what loot is like, what comradery is like, and join discord for a few minutes to see what the voices are like... If there's an airwave dominating female, chances are she gets what she wants.
---
Can't wait for it tonight 🍻
---
How are you going to afford making all those eyes
---
ILL TALK TO YOUR GUILD wtf :))) come on nerd. Get rich or die trying
---
tidyplates i think
---
You can't get accurate estimations from such few data points.  The website has the same problem.
---
I like DS9 better. TNG had the best singular episodes but as a series there's a lot of filler and bad episodes. The first 2 seasons were unwatchable, and towards the end TNG was starting to suffer.
---
Dinged 60 finishing Ony attunement, immediately got into a PUG, T2 helm dropped, rolled a 69 and won.  It was a perfection.
---
A holy priest works well but its tricky balancing the aow and healing and drinking without slowing everyone down.
---
4,547
---
Southpark ruined that for me :/
---
Couple days after launch I was in that same area on my warrior in the early morning and a mage kept polying then wanding me to heal
---
Haha, as a struggling healer I can dig it as well.
---
well we are happy to kill the horde but we would be sad without the Horde.  :) hope you guys stay strong
---
it's surely more horde but alliance make it "impossible" to get to brm from kargath or burning steppes, there are also always ally raids roaming fellwood and winterspring during peek hours. there are also tons of solo alliance players ganking popular farm spot all day.
---
Maybe try class discord or leveling guide on wowhead or icy-veins.
---
It kind of is. That’s 150% horde. We are right between even and being outnumbered 2:1.
---
I'm on Skeram so 60/40 sounds great.
---
&gt;It's 100% accurate for a single Friday evening
---
Which makes it 100% inaccurate to base your assumptions on the servers actual split on that single collection point.
---
Thats the point though, just tell us that the plan is changed and how that will affect phases instead of surprise announcements, I mean the Ion panel a week before blizcon that was contradicted at blizcon regarding phase 2 release just looked really bad on them
---
Warlock bis atm
---
This
---
No, you can toggle that option in the settings of WoW. Real handy.
---
Onyxia scale cloaks are mandatory
---
Not at work I couldn't lmao
---
legit had a mage get it om the first attempt the other day. sorry to ruin your day
---
#nochanges blizzard wya??
---
Whats wrong with sharding?
---
&gt; Feel free to use your big boy words and tell me what you think I missed.
---
Yeah I don't walk people to the point when they're being aggressive dicks about a non issue.
---
&gt; "Why are you so angry?" or a variation is probably the most obvious calling card of a troll. 
---
Mmm you're right, the person who started that exchange with "you've been the one raging at me" really should grow up.
---
&gt; You really need it explained that five characters are stronger than one? Really?
---
Sure, because other than trading looking for a group for having your own and needing to spend a LOT more time micromanaging and a lot longer doing instances etc there isn't a huge benefit. 
---
So I guess yes, I do. Because I don't see an issue even though you seem very adamant about there being many.
---
I really liked how there were way more RP names back then.
---
My first character was Grishgash, the Orc Hunter.
---
i gave up on my 45 hunter as well for now, this server is full of tryhards on both sides, if you don't have a 60 here yet it's going to be rough. should have rolled here sooner, not sure what to tell you.
---
Dude you act like I’m shaming people. I love this all out war that’s going on. When I say killem all I literally mean killem all. I don’t care who you are I just love combat.
---
I hate how people act like the way they play the game is right and everyone else is wrong
---
However their code looks, as long as they in some form have access to the player name, target, etc. it would be trivial to parse the messages and just not print messages if certain conditionals are not met.
---
A good feral dps is amazing to have in groups. One that stays only in cat form all the time... Not so much.
---
The trinket is also very good for every class and it comes free with the other items to boot!
---
&gt; It's 100% accurate for a single Friday evening
---
You heard it here folks. As long as you only play for an hour every Friday it's reliable!
---
Is the WoW reddit community a small fraction of the entire WoW classic playerbase?
---
Just to add to that. After you get them with the nade, they'll likely block as you reach them and you want to blind out of that block. Open up on em again and try to get the kill. Crippling is a life saver here.
---
Both trash unfortunately.
---
Priest mind vision probably.
---
&gt;  They don't understand the game, they just roll dice on ideas and hope something comes up decent.
---
I think this is far too generous
---
every major system in the retail game seems to be cynically designed to extend your playtime (and subscription) whilst requiring as little effort as possible to produce:
---
- titanforging randomness
---
- azerite trait randomness
---
- removal of master looter (so more randomness)
---
- artifact power infinite grind
---
- allied races grind
---
they know exactly what they're doing, unfortunately for them all these changes combined have pissed off nearly all their previous subscirbers
---
too afraid to post logs of every melee having a rare item in week 13 of classic wow?
---
yeah because is bullshit, pretty simple.
---
"yo everyone of our melee already have rag weapons so we are just giving them to ret palas/enh shamans" ha ha
---
Lmao okay dude
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You seriously do not need protection potions for MC our healers are already falling asleep as it is..
---
Wrre you a 3minute mage or clearing aq/Naxx?  Because fire is trash for ony/mc/bwl
---
What does the trinket do? Like how much healing / any other effects?
---
I was debating doing the exalted grind just for that but my enthusiasm puttered out after 10 hours lol.
---
So if I see a mage frost bolt another player that shouldnt show up in combat log?
---
I know those guys on the dps meter! Lol
---
Rockbiter gives you better dps than windfury anyhow. I really only use WF when I'm in a dungeon and other classes present don't benefit from WF totem.
---
Rockbiter isn't as fun as WF, but it gets the job done reliably!
---
I did use the 3min spec in aq 20.  It's been so long, I just don't remember fire being unusable in MC and Ony.
---
I'm on kurrinnax which is close to 60/40 and literally the game outside of raids and instances is nearly unplayable.
---
I pug a lot (healer), and I find people are quite tolerant of anyone who doesn't know the way. Just let the group know up front. 
---
Most people you group with will know the way and know the fights, and there's always at least one person in the group willing to tell you which end is up. 
---
Not knowing the fights or the path doesn't make you suck.
---
I've looted 7 forors total in dm east in 400 runs.
---
although playing as one I can understand it since it costs a ton of mana (at least for me at 42)  just to shift into cat form, and then if you don't pick a talent + a helmet it then takes forever to regen energy too
---
Getting the Trindlehaven Stave was probably my luckiest moment, that and rolling against about 10 other people for the 28 slot soulshard bag pattern in MC.
---
Other than those two ive been extremely unlucky lol
---
Work schedule? Lmao
---
&gt; Do I have that kind of commitment / leadership / time? Yes, but I spend it leading a successful life and career outside of videogames. 
---
I'm not sure why you're taking offense or thinking you're being gatekept. **You get out what you put in.** You might have leadership qualities but an absentee leader isn't a leader. 
---
It's an honest answer and one you should probably take into consideration so you and your friends don't get your hopes up only to be disappointed.

It's just the realities of running a raiding guild. You wanna be told you can just show up a few days a week and get a bunch of casual players together and clear content? Sure, you can maybe do that if you're lucky but odds are you're simply just gonna end up not raiding or doing pugs and never going to AQ40 or Naxx and probably stuck trying to clear B.W.L.
---
World of Warcraft is a game that *requires* a fair bit of time commitment just to go to raids. Like, *just to be a raider* you need to have some time on hand. To be the GM of a decent raiding guild takes about five times amount of time and effort.
---
You might not view that as an important aspect of your life and not worth your time. Great, good for you.
---
I tried running a raid guild on two separate occasions. Once back during TBC, and one recently in Classic WOW. Putting people in the right positions, keeping people happy. I came online every day to run dungeons with people, invite new people, keep people leveling and progressing. I ended up with 80 people in the guild and only like 20 of them were max level.
---
You know what I learned? I don't have time for that shit. If you don't have time for that shit either, then you should do the best thing for you and your team. *Merge your guild.*
---
I merged *my* guild, took a back seat to leadership, and I put in about 1/5th of the amount of time as I used to on a weekly basis.
---
I get to raid with my friends, enjoy a new community, and I don't do almost any work but show up for raid time and still have a say in certain matters because I'm an officer and brought over a huge chunk of the raid team.
---
Merging my guild with another one was the best thing I could have done for myself and my friends and guildies who I came to know because prior to that I was burning the fuck out.
---
If your ego about the situation is more important and you got your butt-hurt over me implying you don't have leadership qualities then sorry, but that is just the reality of the situation. You aren't going to clear anything outside of MC/Ony if you don't have the time to run a raid guild.
---
Take the chip off your shoulder and just merge your guild, you and your friends will have a much better time, screw your guild identity and pride.
---
Boomkins
---
Your fighting dragons and firemonsters
---
Nothing you do on one character will cause ID issues with another character on the same account.
---
I keep seeing people say im looking for sympathy...listen nerds i thought it was funny i logged on and just died it would be quite pathetic to come on reddit and cry about it lol &lt;3
---
man horde on ZT have it so bad. BGs are cross realm so not only will they have a worse wpvp environment but longer queues too
---
It's a small fraction of a small fraction if I had to make a guess I'd say 1% tops.
---
Do EU servers lean more towards the Alliance? I know the US servers lean heavily towards Horde
---
I would have booted him the second time he went to the wrong entrance (everyone can make a mistake once)
---
A pigeon?
---
Powershifting happens too quickly too put you at risk of the mana knockback, it's safe. If you need to innervate, do it while you've backed off for Wrath
---
That maybe true but I'm not that rich lol. I found it killing dragons welps
---
1,132 runs, with each run being what, 1.5 hours average? Let’s just be generous and call it 1,000 hours which would come out to 41.6 days.
---
[Not quite!](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/community/leaderboards/?region=EU&amp;leaderboardId=BG)
---
They could do something similar for Classic.
---
Iirc you can /tar him from the entrance, he spawns within the radius
---
It removes the community from the game. If you're on a mega server players get moved around and you don't see the same players over and over. This is a big part of the reason why classic is appealing for so many people. Classic requires you to be social within a community. You can see the guy you were questing with or spamming dungeons with at level 30, now in Ironforge or Orgrimmar wearing tier gear and kickin ass. You can gank the people who ganked you while leveling. You can be someone in your community.
---
My b I misread your comment, thought you were mad at OP lol.
---
If you sell it you'll be rich enough to buy it.  \*tap\*
---
Ummm what
---
But what does this accomplish? You deal zero damage and waste a stun DR. This matchup is a damage race (for the rogue)
---
well yea we’re killing rag easy but i’m not gonna get pants for a while
---
Yes so I sold it. Then bought it again and placed it in my bag !
---
Definitely not. Wow classic sub is at 400k subscribers. And if even only 20% of that 400k subs still views and post that's way more than 1% of the playerbase. Considering they also make balance changes off of what's posted here frequently....
---
Id say reddit is atleast 15% of the player base.
---
Buttblast and Mcqueef.
---
As far as I'm aware there's no EU PVP servers except the two ghost town servers listed above that have any kind of Alliance tilt. The PVE and RP servers tilt Alliance heavily in most cases, but the PVP servers seem to be all Horde all the time unfortunately.
---
Uh, hate to break it to ya but swiftmend spec is the go-to FC spec
---
Are there still leaderboards in D3?
---
Honestly? Yeah. Most of us playing wow aint even boomers, we are all probably millennials.
---
What's it?
---
Won the greed roll on the first axe as I was in Scholo, and got the second one a week later in EP. An undead shade attacked me while I was trying to teleport home. I killed it and voilà :p
---
I'm also extremely unlucky as I've been chasing items since I dinged 60 and never even saw them drop, like scholo's wand :p
---
Hi Razorgore.
---
I did it in classic 15 years ago. The trinket suck .... If the AI of that stupid bear was good then maybe, but he kept healing me when it wasn t needed, and keep attacking when i needed heal. I know i will never do that again :P but gratz anyway :D
---
Can someone put the halo intro song over this please or at least when the explosion starts
---
Big grats man!!
---
The novelty factor is nice in comparison to P1, but it's complete ass for actually trying to gain honor. Roam in small groups and get run over, or roam in large groups and get no honor, pick your poison.
---
ah yes... boomkin simulator.
---
now you just need green plate, a gun and you will be... THE DOOMKIN.
---
They're probably just roleplaying, it's this way in the story too.
---
This is the real answer and should be at the top of the comments.
---
you're a customer, so you'll pay for my bathwater drinks
---
Yea I am sure you were just as effective as the spy addon.
---
every other hunter I saw in vanilla was some variant of Legolas
---
He uses the Spy addon.
---
Whoosh
---
Literally incorrect.
---
Just because there are a million things to do on a vast MMO doesn't mean you have to do them all. Pick what you like most. Especially if you cant find time for any pvp on top of a 2-3h a week raid commitment.
---
In active over level 50s it's more like 3:1 favoring alliance
---
They varied greatly in quality during the first two weeks. I’m sure they’ve been cleaned up but some of the lists were lazy shit everyone’s complaining about already.
---
[Yeah](https://eu.diablo3.com/en/rankings/era/12/rift-barbarian), that too.
---
XxX_Legolas420_XxX
---
Or maybe they *should* highly recommend it for horde players to improve balance. 
---

---
You can’t tar him from entrance, as a warlock send ur vw into the first group, run to the tunnel and target him. Then die and do it until you get him. You can pretty much clear the tag with 2 dps and a healer
---
But why it should be the same, if now everything is at much faster rate?
---
having a nightfall offhealer or two is the next best thing if you cant find a hunter willing to spam rank 1 wingclip with it
---
Unless you're a ret paladin, you'll likely find most raiders are already heavily geared and you can just swoop in and pick up unwanted bits.
---
As a hunter I had to wait so many weeks to get full t1 and bow, now we add a new hunter to the roster and they're seemingly getting 2 or 3 bits of tier a week and bow in first raid etc.
---
It's fucking hilarious how classic re-fuels the faction hate, ganking is easier without flying and with less graveyards around dying it's actually pretty annoying, so it really bothers people when they get killed in pvp outdoor, meanwhile in retail you had an entire expansion themed around faction war and people barely gave a flying shit about it lol.
---
From UD side btw
---
Why would they need to go to Kalimdor? Only thing there is DM and Onyx.
---
Onyx usually go with raid, whereas a lot of ppl just set hearth in Feathermoon Stronghold for DM farming.
---
Just hang in until bgs
---
His name is Charlie and he's testing out the new ratstick his friends got him
---
What is the fastest way to reset Mara?
---
I agree, and I think multi boxing is super scummy.
---
Some warlocks are extremely bad with their health management, and are often completely unaware of any issues a healer may currently be struggling with. That said, most warlocks are good about it, and some are amazing. The difference is night and day, and I feel like the bottom end of the spectrum could use a bit of tough love.
---
If the analogy falls apart so does your reimagining of it. Goldeneye has a player limit. So let's stick to wow, a lot of people think the spy addon is cheating. Even with Blizzard nerfing it, it still exists. To those people using it is cheating and to others using it is not cheating. Blizzard allows it, so not cheating. Substitute dbm or whatever addon you need to make this work in your mind. Outselling wow tokens for gold, or whatever other decision yiu disagree with.
---
In the end, Blizzard decides if it's cheating, not you.
---
What is the utility in having a second (or multiple accounts, besides multiboxing? For example, is there any utility in having a second account to play on the opposite faction on my PvP server over just rolling that character on a different server?
---
Yeah you are supposed to not hold W after your initial jump, it makes you fall down. Jump holding W and then immediately let it go during the jump
---
wish I was horde
---
Why am I just now noticing how hideous the forearms look on humans
---
They are indeed gryphons, and some addons have an alternative of being lions instead of gryphons.
---
It’s terrible. 
---
You ever see a mob sit there and decide if it wants to heal or cast lightning bolt for a few seconds, then cast heal right before it dies only to have done nothing for a solid 10 seconds. That’s the dumb furblog that this thing spawns.
---
I did the grind back in vanilla, I don’t regret it but I won’t be doing it again in classic.
---
That's really good to know as someone at around 730g and grunt + half a bar
---
and fuck that troll in particular
---
I believe that follows a similar way of thought than spellbatching, trying to even the odds for every player no matter how good the hardware

You deem “using the spy addon” as scummy? 🤨
---
dbm does not an repeat does NOT automate your input stop tryng again to justify something unethical at base and impossible to do without willful purposefuly breaking an MMO RPG into MMO bunch of roles game? I dunno even know what you call it ROLE playing not bunch of roles playing lol
---
I FELT this story. Holy hell, if this isn't a familiar tell. Sorry dude. I hope you find good groups in the future.
---
There’s literally 2 raids out out of how many? World PvP is the only kind of pvp that exists while we wait for BGs? Honor was only just released a week ago? 
---
You make it seem like everything’s been released and people are bored. One step at a time. If you’re already fully geared then either you’re blessed with free time to play or being handed everything like the top steamers.
---
Lol damn
---
homeboy alliance used a thistle for that
---
be proud

well its like he was boasting about drinking 2 bottles of vodka at once and finishing them up in 1min, we know there is something rotten down there in his brain

Congrats man. I remember when Battlefield 4 came out, for a week I was ranked 10 in the world for scout helicopter kills. It was dumb as shit but felt really cool. Hope it brings you some happiness.

if you are sore and need a day off dont stay at home still go to gym and walk laps for your usual gym time. Keep that part of going in your day to day routine. if you need a chill day thats fine and take it but still go.
---
Source: i know if i skip a day and stay home i usually dont end up there the next day and go on a missing streak.
---
What kind of stats can it track/tell you?
---
Keep it up! They say after 4 weeks it becomes a habit. It turned into a holy gym habit for me. :)
---
You keep using words without solid definitions, unethical again is your perspective. Some people think it's unethical for me to get drunk, but I think it's fine, and the law has no problem with it.
---
In this situation Blizzard decides.
---
It must've been a case of someone acting on something within your render range but themselves being outside your render range. For example, if as a priest I mind vision you across the map, your game will have access to my name, you'll see it in the combat log, but you won't be able to target me because I'll be hundreds of yards away. In the same way, if a diemetradon was at the edge of your render range and received a damage or debuff from a ranged class way outside of your render range (possibly even 200 yards away from you if it was, say, a hunter placing his mark). But that's because someone acted on something you could see. If a rogue enters stealth right outside of your render range, you won't see it. If someone mounts up, you won't see it, if someone fights something right outside your render range, you won't see it either.
---
So if in light of all this your answer is "well there you have it, spy had 200 yards range", I would say that, no, if you want to think about it like that, spy actually has a 1000 yards range, or maybe even more, depending on exactly how far you can mind vision someone. And in that case, it's something that you could notice even without spy or your combat log. After all, sometimes, if you're used to paying attention to mobs around you, you'll see a mob scurrying to or from a distant location that's outside of your render range. That's a clear indication that someone is there and has interacted with that mob, and while you won't be able to know their faction, class or level without looking at your combat log, you still have technically detected someone's presence without spy.
---
So it's definitely more awareness than you'd usually have in most cases, especially if you're not observant, but spy's detection range definitely does not extend beyond render range. It's limited to stuff that happens inside your render range, even if the actors are outside of it.
---
I'm enjoying PvP ranking, I'm don't enjoy BRD grinding.
---
Virgin megastore
---
Go to PvE you carebear.
---
Nah.
---
But I would love an international realm. One of the best things about Nost was the fact it had no downtime. People were pvping and raiding 24/7 no breaks.
---
&gt; Well, for starters, there's nearly triple the number of PvP realms than PvE realms in the Americas region alone. 
---
No duh, because Blizzard knows what's popular.
---
If everyone wanted to do PVE, every single PVE server would be overpopulated and stuck in 2 hour long queues every single night.
---
News flash, most hardcore players play on PVP and most casual players play on PVE. That's a fact, not an opinion. It has been that way since Vanilla and is no different in B.F.A or Classic WOW.
---
If that bruises your ego that's another conversation but the facts of the matter is that the most hardcore player base are on PVP servers and have virtually always have been.
---
Does that mean you personally or *all* PVE people are casual players or bad players? Of course not.
---
Does that mean that *on average* a PVP player is likely to be more hardcore than a PVE player? It most certainly does.
---
Damn I got 4 epics already.
---
250 kills into mara princess and still no blade of eternal darkness.... how lucky is that!?!?!

In general, anything that says "chance on hit:" does not proc in forms. Anything that says "equip:" does.

also curious for that farm time

&gt;And that's why retail sucks
---
Fixed it for you. When games are developed to milk money from customers, not to be fun - they become endless grindfests with p2w and lootboxes.
---
You want that :) Most people dont
---
The whole "im an adult i dont have time for.." 
---
ah yes thats how retail was ruined!
---
Yet Alliance haven't got any wbosses apart from the first Kazzak lol
---
&gt;if you don't go in a progression order u can forget about raiding naxx,you wont have the gear for it.
---
I would imagine there will be plenty of people who skip and just run Nax with a filler group because reality is its not gonna be hard to do.
---
also the Hall of Fame for first 100 guilds since bfa, so the original statement was kind of far from reality
---
Praise Tymora!
---
Winning a roll on mageblade 8 hrs after hitting 60
---
Yeah because you dont have to use your mount for like 3/4 of the expansion on retail. And maybe you should look up a lvl 100+ raid tactic and a lvl60 raid tactics, or just look at the retail dps rotation or the vanilla rotations of the same classes. Classic is like the phone game version of retail.
---
No idea, he seems like an ass hat to me
---
Well and now? Since most offworries play with Deep Wounds they will knock off weapon proccs anyway
---
Please help, I need a macro that will go like this 
---
castequence reset=10 Berserker stance, whirlwind, beserker rage, cleave, Battle stance ?
---
macros really do my head in.
---
Genuinely curious, are there any other servers where the horde basically have alliance cities on farm?  You aren't safe anywhere in IF and the SW flightpath is constantly camped by just a few horde on Skeram.
---
Redridge mountains?
---
Sounds like you don't like classic then ;)
---
somehow this quite accurately describes what i feel "top" wow players are
---
This is pretty much all undead mages lmao
---
Or wow armory. Wasnt originally classic but i miss it
---
Greater SP elixirs for 35sp. These last an hour so u need maybe 2 unless u die.
---
Greater fire protection potion or 2 for rag.
---
Mana pots if the raid dps is low and u run oom in fights. Typically gems and evo get u far enough. 
---
Thats about it really. Could take runn tuber soup food for 10 int for 10 minutes but its really irrelevant and won't make a difference
---
Well I mean telling someone the price and trying to force them to accept is theft. Anyway  you tried to rip someone off and it didn't work you're on the wrong just saying.
---
Wow it's clear as a day you're ganking lowbies, and trying to defend your self by saying you killed 2 other 60s.
---
Could the fact that horde is outnumbering ally and therefore at any time of the day/night has more people ready to go there? Hmm
---
That wasn’t the problem in retail they built an expansion around world pvp and let people opt out of it while giving a bonus to a dominant faction. They let server balances get so bad there were basically no servers left with fair balances so when they let people quit world pvp it killed the expansion that focused on pvp.
---
My OCDness got the best of mean looking at my ability bars, so I went with the macro game.  I am a casual player, 39 shammy at the moment (couldn't play in October).  
---
Cancel form/dismount on all macros

---
E - lighting shield and wf enh
---

It is still a work in progress, and I am figuring out different areas I want to improve for finger placement.  For now, this works quite well
---
We get it, you're affected, lol Struck a chord, we're backing off sir, don't jump.
---
Omg we got one of those the other day. Nobody could use so we censored it.
---
oh yeah you definitely wasn't sarcatistic saying "cartoon game" my bad
---
and yes saying you got 10+ strikers+blastershot is bullshit. literally no guild has had that. it's been 12 weeks.
---
/cast [@mouseover, harm] purge; [@mouseover, help] cleanse spirit; [harm] purge; [help][@player] cleanse spirit
---
The other macro didn't quite follow your preference. If you had a friendly target it would never try to purge the mouseover
---
Cheap shot initially and instantly gouge right after so he wastes that blink he would use to get out of cheap shot.  Thank me later
---
As an alliance rogue, where do you farm for honor? Solo or small groups?
---
I think HOTS still has it too.
---
It's always good with guides and more Classic content. Not sure why you show a damage meter on the thumbnail though, it's entirely relative to the raid you're in. Without any real context - their performance, consumables, gear etc. compared to your own it means nothing. Truth be told, I don't know why anyone even uses a damage meter xD All it does is clutter your screen and provide you with unimportant information. Just record logs and check that afterwards.
---
Not gonna lie, It is a very very good cloak
---
/cast [@mouseover, harm][] blind
---
I made sure to have a big twohander and a ele shaman. Everytime I WF oneshot  a player, it does not matter if 20 others are waiting your you. We secured the whole honor for the 2 of us.
---
Sad to see clickers still exist
---
Ep 1, Favouritism
---
Honestly not that sad to hear this, there's basically an alli genocide on every other server so this is honestly just reassuring even if on another server. Coming from an alliance warrior on mograine.
---
Or just buy them
---
That NPC has the spy add-on. 🤣
---
Right, this is my last reply to you - a dataset is just one or more tables of data, which this is, and I honestly don't understand why you're claiming that the horde and alliance population numbers aren't related to each other (as if you get to decide). But whatever.
---
People are plenty capable of figuring out for themselves how much the numbers might change. You told me yourself that the numbers would be changing because people were waiting for BGs, and so forth. People usually have some idea of whether a Friday night is more or less busy than a Monday night or Sunday daytime on their server. 
---
When I said the data was 100% accurate, all I meant was that it captured all players online on the server at that point in time (which an addon is required to do). You seem to think I'm claiming that this is a totally accurate playercount of every character on the server, but it's not, which is why none of your arguments make any sense.
---
Anyway, I'm done with this now. I think people will appreciate looking at that list and being able to take an educated guess at the makeup of that server, whereas you obviously think their brains will go into meltdown because there's not enough data points. No point debating it further.
---
fyi any store warranties are not worth the paper they are written on and a complete waste of money.
---
Good thing your and your opinion do not matter.
---
I’ve run BRD twice on my Druid so far. First time HoJ dropped and I lost the roll. Figured I’d never see it again. Dropped on next run and I won it with an 82roll. 2 for 2
---
I've seen Treant's Bane sell for between 150-300g
---
Don't worry about chest despawning, cdew had treants bane drop, and an unfortunate series of events made him run around the world for a bit, chest was still there 40-60 minutes later
---
Ask for payment upfront, if they don't agree, then ask for half.
---
Once you've done a few runs, always take payment upfront, and if the buyer is reluctant then you can ask him to whisper any other people you've helped out
---
Some of us may act like NPCs, but lots of us really do care and are a people just like you!
---
Sometimes a stranger can be just the friend or shoulder you need at the right time.
---
Note that the main map and mini map are VERY different regarding shoreline accuracy, so if some of these look weird, it's cuz the map doesn't do a great job of reflecting the actual terrain.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I recall from Vanilla one thing about Azshara: how much a PITA it is to get off the damn beach. Now that my char in classic is there, first thing I did was map it out and use the Handy Notes addon to put horseshoe icons where the paths up are. Swam around the ENTIRE zone, so pretty sure I didn't miss any, but let me know if you see otherwise.
---
Figured I'd post here for others to reference.
---
Be quiet bro
---
If the price you bid is to low he has every ability to take the item of the auction house and allow people to bid at a price he finds acceptable. 
---
  Like he did when you tried to low ball him for it and then cry over it. You're literally making a reddit post saying you should FORCE someone to sell you an item at the 1/100 the price. You really do t see what's wrong with forcing other people to sell you something cheap?
---
Like full chicken or would something like moonglow spec work?
---
No one is that lucky.  That's theft.
---
Here's my take.  
---
If queues are going to be as bad for horde as everyone believes they will be that is actually bad for alliance WPvP.
---
If all the alliance PvPers are sitting in SW waiting for their near instant queues they aren't going to be outin the wild PvPing.  Whereas horde with their not so instant queues are gonna need something to do and that 10-man WSG premade is probably gonna be farming in Winterspring or EPL with what little presence the alliance had not there at all.
---
What do you mean? This is the world first kill of Onyxia.
---
in wpvp those trinkets are useless, either u get stomped or u stomp, there is barely any even ground
---
Too many DPS look for dungeon groups. You should start your own party and make the rules. Too many lazy people don’t want to spam chat, asking guildies to help with dungeon can also save time and help them gear up.
---
God damn this is the oldest screenshot of a desktop Ive seen
---
lmao the amount of delusion and ignorance in this comment
---
Good lord we are so very much done with this conversation. 
---
You have a good one mate.
---
If you play during AV weekend you can do it in one shot. If you work weekends like me it might take two AV weekends to do it with occasional battles during the week.
---
You're a 60 horde rogue, im basically happy u got killed. You're the bane of my existence as an alliance warrior, evey second longer you spend dead is a second longer i can get on with my life.
---
Anyone know the resist chance of blind? When I try to blind other players in high tense situations, it keeps getting resisted half the time
---
Same for alliance.
---
My LC/EpGp guild auctions the bag every raid for the guild fund. Each bag usually sells for 200-250g
---
Of course it can go higher - and if all the other servers die, where exactly do you think their players will transfer? Hint: straight into your queue.
---
This will go In circles because you think only other people doing something to game the system is bad but you doing it is fine. Simple answer is put a reasonable bid and you'll probably get your item. Or be cheap and cry. Laataaaaa
---
You can use auction houses item count to estimate the faction ratio. And all item count might be not accurate. You can search count of some categories to compare.

Sorry for the late reply.. they very well could reach 5-8g with the populations we have. I'm just talking in terms of what occurred on pservers. Nevertheless, good time to buy them.
---
" Anyway, I'm done with this now. I think people will appreciate looking  at that list and being able to take an educated guess at the makeup of  that server " 
---
And this is the issue I take with your post. Its not an educated guess its a wild ass guess because of how limited the data you recorded is.

Invite a person to your party, pass them leader while you logout. Once you are logged out,  this person will reset all instances. You can log in when you think this is done. You will spawn at the beginning with a fresh reset dungeon.
---
I guess just poor judgement on your part. No problem.
---
yeah if you're powershifting even a little bit this isnt viable
---
Whenever I go to quest there is always a ganksquad nearbby. Plguelands, ungoro, winterspring, ~~fel~~gankwood all got people ready to blast my ass
---
We were honestly done ages ago but you kept rambling about nothing.
---
Have a great one, try not to get too bothered by other people having different opinions than your own.
---
If that's the case why did he set the starting bid at 1c?
---
Orc racial doesn't matter much in PvP. 5 weapon skill only gives you 0.2% increased chance to hit (and 0.2% reduced chance to dodge + parry) against an equal level target.
---
You need 5% melee hit to reach the cap in PvP. IMO it's not that important for Shaman. Rogues and Warriors want hit in PvP so that their stuns and interrupts never miss, but your interrupt (and all of your utility spells) works on spell hit. There is always a 1% chance to miss with spells (you can't cap it like you can with melee).
---
Get hit if you can, but don't sacrifice too many stats for it.
---
This is helpful. The beach is indeed a pita
---
Considering you can only reset 5 times per hour its quite easy to  check both sides, especially as a warlock
---
but no one expected significant amount of people on one server which just alters the game much more in almost every aspect, though i did play in vanilla and know that wpvp in wow never was fair, i dont blame that newcomers dont know what they got into and I for example also didnt expect raids of ppl in 3 in the morning lurking those 3x 60s that happen to be in same location.... i underestimated nolifers again
---
How mature of you.
---
joined a pick-up group because someone whispered me, was at like 11 PM and almost immediately I realized that putting down one curse and then hitting shadow bolt was really really boring. Right after Lucifron the raid went to a safe spot to wait for another healer and then I went out in the downtime
---
i want felheart stuff for aesthetics but raids are a total snooze, might skip
---
You have to understand.  New Blizzard != Old Blizzard.  Old Blizzard gave a shit and made a game that was fun to hopefully get subscriptions.   New Blizzard makes a game to get subscriptions and fun is secondary.
---
We were honestly done ages ago considering you've literally just been making shit up these last few comments.
---
yeah in Vanilla you can do your raid and then chill out for one week if you like without feeling like you missed out on something.
---
Yea, my point is you dont fix it in the print function. But we dont have Blizzard's source so we dont know WHERE we could make changes, much less what changes will actually work.
---
So saying "it's easy to not print" is true, but not a sufficient enough answer on how to actually fix anything.
---
Íon Cannon!
---
the difference is that in vanilla it was done to create an experience that players will find enjoyable and satisfying but in BFA they're done to psychologically abuse the player into submission.
---
Not sure they have a financial incentive to. Unless people stay subbed for longer due to this, creating it brings no revenue, only costs.

not really, i dont know who thinks that sitting ducks with 20 ppl killing loners who just run away is fun for more than 10minutes, its not about joy of pvp the "art" of it, its just mindless grind
---
Then leave classic and play in a private server.
---
Didn't work at thorium point. it repeatedly gave me the error "there is no direct path to that destination."
---
Nice, noggenfogger represent.
---
not to be rude, but in what way are you still figuring out a fight that has hundreds of videos and guides? what is going wrong?
---
20g, guy was lucky he didnt have to sit ducks around the chest for so long,
---
This is the post I needed an hour ago
---
Funny,[ I made pretty much the same Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/kCxa5RZ.jpg) when I reached Rank13 back in Vanilla.
---
Aren’t they aren’t
---
hunters can not be kept in combat they just fd
---
*Should have
---
Lame and Gay
---
It pisses me off when cats or even the bear tank never gets out of form to heal the lock or just innervate every 6 mins to prevent a drink break if a boss isnt near. Its just stupid and a waste. Source: was bear tank that did this.
---
I remember seeing a post like this before, its most likely the dude is leveling up a low weapon skill and alliance used to do the same thing back in the day apparently.
---
Ive decided on bloodsail buccanears, ty all
---
What honor standing #1 actually means is rolling rogue =(
---
??? And go back in combat instantly? 
---
Nevermind guessing you’re not a hunter and never have done dm:north
---
How in the hell are you the sole decider of right and wrong in this world? You ask what is wrong with me, I am just explaining that the world is a lot bigger than you. I also gave you several examples of games where you may think something is cheating that other people don't but you skipped those.
---
I am not trying to prove my position is right, I am trying to point out that your position is yours alone, and you don't get to make the choice here.
---
Is it possible to build a targeting macro that runs some sort of a /tar nickname exists for a mouseover of the Spy GUI?
---
...not that I want this, because it will break the game further, but I figure if I've thought of this someone else is probably already doing it.
---
as the fellow above said, honorspy is wildly inaccurate atm
---
Imagine if they didnt ban them? They'd be everywhere. Kiss buying wow time with gold goodbye too.
---
Thunderfury is a close balance. Alliance fight hard and well
---
[Yeah, sure they have.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/pvp/leaderboards/3v3)
---
You can blink a kidney shot...
---
I mean, it works maybe?
---
But Arms is infinetely better, if you don't wanna spend tons of money on Arcanite Reaper you should look for a Hunter selling Treants Bane, usually going for around 150g on my realm, may be higher on yours
---
(Yes I know Treant's Bane Isn't very good due to its fast speed, but It's a cheap option)
---
&gt;It's the second day when most of the rebuilding is going on.
---
And it's so much worse when you're first getting into it, or getting back into it. Feel it the most in your legs the most if you're doing squats or something similar. I remember when I got back into it and really gave it my all on that one day. 2 days later I was at a festival, sitting with my legs crossed on the grass and I literally could not get back up by myself. My girlfriend had to help me up and the pain was tremendous trying to sit down or get up.
---
Sick burn bro.
---
He looks a lot like Mrs. Featherbottom
---
Nice!
---
If that results in some of the horde masses rolling to alliance I'm fine with that, they tried nicely to get people to balance the server with the early free transfers. Maybe doing it the hard way will have more impact.
---
People acting like its a big deal when it really doesnt matter.
---
Dont be sad, im good
---
Great job man!
---
Even if you’re right, it’s still whining...and no one likes a whiner. I’m just trying to help you out. 
---
And I agree, it’s not enjoyable right now, so don’t play it. Blizzard already announced they’re releasing BGs early — right now the only way for people to gain honor is from WPvP. So either stop playing until the bgs come out or stop whining. Shit or get off the pot.
---
Well A its from 2 months ago, B they even state on the page several servers appear to be under reporting numbers at the time of the data collection.
---
Raid MC until BRE or OEB drops for you. Easy solution to finding a 2H.
---
Class fantasy and lore are very different...
---
Seen here:  A rogue getting away.
---
The reason is exactly the one you are giving, so you can't just character switch to jump the reset timers... it's 5 resets per hour FINAL.
---
Other schools really don’t matter for PvE though, for what it’s worth.
---
If you can hit rank 14 “quickly” then yeah maybe this game is too casual for you...
---
was not prepared for a screenshot like this. The flashbacks are coming in all at once!
---
for real this is one of the saddest things i’ve read in a while.
---
Lol I feel you and I did ~330 less than you. The thing about probability too is that even though you have a ~87% chance of getting the Drakestone in 400 runs, if you haven’t gotten it by 401 you’re still not any more likely to get it in your next 400 runs lol.
---
Honestly when I started I was hoping I’d get lucky and get it in just a few dozen runs. I had the Frozen Wrath one drop on like my 8th run and thought it was the Shadow Wrath one for a split second.
---
Oh well, no biggie
---
Just got perditions blade on my rogue so I finally completed my dagger psuedo exodia combo with perds/cht. Feels so good two shotting clothies before they can even react to it now
---
&gt; What is bannable is if there is software that makes decisions and controls your characters for you.
---
It doesn't. It just allows you to send the "1" to every window instead of just the active window. You still have to control them all and choose what to press as well as set the whole fucking circus up.
---
Good strat, but the shaman could force a stalemate by just healing and playing defensive since their heals would be more mana efficient than the druid's damage spells.
---
Congrats man, being number 1 at anything takes hard work.
---
some of my guildies don't even show up when they're online
---
&gt; Why is 5 okay but 10 is not, it's still multiple outputs for one input.
---
A better way to word it is one input per window. You press "1" and every window receives a "1" press. Not any more inputs or any less.
---
How is it whining? I am agreeing with OP. Since when did having an opinion on a topic mean your whining? I thankfully got to 60 before WPVP came out so it's not such an issue for me, but I can sympathize with all the posts about it. I've never seen the fun in ganking, that's all.
---
then why create it originally? there must have been a reason then and wouldn't it also apply now?
---
Pug raids are hit and miss. Communication is a big part of a 40 player group.
---
Do you even play classic
---
It scans people you target / mouseover and now reports in a global channel so it should be much more accurate this week first last. It has had a update every single day
---
Almost none of them get banned. I know many people who botted for years in retail, very few ever got caught.
---
+21 frost is not bad.
---
Clearly you are not as geared as I am. I’ll have you know that I am an Orc Warrior of the Horde, of the 60th level, and am fully adorned in plate armor of Might. When I wield my Quel’Serrar, the Highblade, I watch the plebeians running in my vicinity stop to take in the godly sight beholding them before they continue. I blow my Horn of the Swift Timber Wolf and the noise of Orgrimmar comes to a halt as everyone stops in their tracks. My majestic white wolf comes barreling through the crowd and I mount him with the grace you would expect of a Warrior of my caliber. Suddenly the peasants in their dungeon gear whisper me, “Incredible progression,” or, “Wow, your gear is amazing!” Yes, the tribulation of acknowledging those below me for stating the obviousness of my glory can be rather tedious, but when I kiss my mother goodnight and turn off the lights in the living room, I can lay down on the couch with peace of mind knowing how proud she must be of my progression and status in the world of Azeroth.
---
Wah wah wah
---
Sure, but what I mean is the player is only hitting one key, even if software is creating five separate inputs.
---
Gold bid for bag is the way to go for sure. Helps both parties.
---
Not sure what you mean, the 16 roll? I wouldn't know if thats him or not lol
---
it'll get a lot better in a couple weeks when battlegrounds come out
---
I respect the grind, sir! At the end of the day thats what classic is all about, you just pick whatever you feel like spending your time on and just do it. If you're dedicated enough it's only a matter of time.
---
Ion was a hardcore player too.
---
The issues are probably deeper than that. Development seems to be heavily driven by player engagement metrics likely decided by people over Ion's head. Ion's job is to implement design according to these metrics.
---
It explains why we never see content like Hand of Rag anymore, that a small portion of the playerbase would get to use.
---
It’s frustrating AF. Open on a dude in IF then 2 rando rogues pop up and leach most of the honour.
---
anyone remember that vanilla video where all the guy had on his action bars was moonfire?
---
I've seen people straight up ignore upgrades because they weren't BiS. Like, dude... it's still going to help why turn down the 3rd best thing when the first best thing requires you to obtain a super rare item?!
---
While leveling, I strongly recommend going into retribution. They aren’t levelers, and prot and holly will make things go slower. Paladins are Very mana dependent, and that makes it hard to tank at early levels. At level 38 you get blessing of wisdom, and that will help if you’re dead set on tanking. It’s very easy to heal in dungeons with some healing gear, and its only around max level where you need to start specializing in holy.
---
I want it gone. I don't use it out of principal!
---
With a name like that you deserved to die
---
How is it better than maiden's circle and/or eye of orgrimmar/songstone of ironforge?
---
You have fuck all idea what you're talking about and I can't belive it's being up voted.
---
One less illiterate dummy to worry about.
---
The shaman's heals are about twice as mana efficient as the druid's DPS spells so innervate won't be enough.
---
Yeah.. Just let the man have his win. I am sure he knows that World of Warcraft isn't the only thing in life that matters, no one actually truly believes that. All these replies are not real help, just unhelpful, misplaced sympathy imo. Sort of almost belittles the achievement. Standing 1 is no easy task. Achieving something like that, isn't meaningless. Using that same drive in other aspects of life, and now seeing that you actually *have* that drive, can be quite helpful. Good job u/gggerms
---
Makes sense, I learned that from this sub. How does it make
---
You said you made a similar post but a bunch of people told you to stfu. I’m letting you know why they said that.
---
Needs it for ah
---
Spy.. god damn spy
---
Unless you’re a gnome. Then it’s a facial.
---
So I level solo for the most part so guildies will ask me to help reset for them. 
---
I've also seen people ask in trade/LFG for someone to reset for them with compensation. I volunteer if I see it. I never give them a price nor do I ask cuz I don't really care tbh. They usually will come to me or mail me gold when they're done. Depending on how long/how generous they are, I've made anywhere from 3g up to 20g. Plus we both have someone to talk to and now I'm their go-to for resets. So yeah, offering payment always helps.
---
He talks in memes from 2009
---
This is why I don’t get why people play PvP servers...I have limited time to play don’t want to just waste it running back and forth from a graveyard, PvE server can PvP when I want to and quest/other stuff when I want to
---
Just looked at the code. It calls CombatLogGetCurrentEventsInfo()
---
I did exactly this with 20 Elemental Fires.
---
You are incorrect.
---
This did exist in vanilla WoW, it came when pvp system was first released in patch 1.4,  19 April 2005.
---
Yes, I would value the stamina more than the 4 sp in PvP
---
my hunter alt got t2 helm and has the leaf and sinew. he isnt even 60 yet. we have 3 raiding hunters.
---
because its 5 inputs for 5 things, not 10 inputs for 5 things.
---
Is that the same as  other damage meters?  I've never looked through addon code or tried to make them, dunno what i'd be looking at.
---
Ive been nolifing from launch and have good gear. Wpvp allows me to swing my big dick around and destroy those who have commited less time
---
Okay i will try this when I get home. What I was doing was walking up to the wall and then press the space bar and then w about 1 second after i hit the space bar. I was not holding w while jumping
---
yes, 5 different 1 inputs.
---
What ratios do you consider "incredibly lopsided"?
---
I didn’t have a job when classic released so the queue time wasn’t a problem before. I’m lvl 55 hopefully I can hit 60 before my 8am class.
---
Spells have coefficients. The data is definitely out there. Some spells gain more damage than others from spell power.
---
I'm talking about private servers.
---
Even on private servers, threat is the main issue.
---
My favorite combination of Red bull and Modelo.
---
Don't save it all up, If you have 150g or w/e, buy a few Arcanite Bars
---
Always spend money towards it, if you're gonna save up fully It's gonna feel like hell
---
I would imagine you could come up with some economic benefits by using the AH in Booty Bay.
---
You'd think that sometime during that 200+ hours, you'd learn how your class works.
---
I love you guys as a warlock just sayin
---
Nope, never played retail
---
Characterstatsclassic
---
Or maybe its called classiccharacterstats, its got what you want
---
What? Do you know how many people have resubbed just for classic alone? How is that not a factor
---
Sorry but I believe it to be the other way around as multiboxers are such a tiny percentage of the total, to the point where there's a good chance that lost revenue from people that have stopped playing due to getting murdered by 1 guy playing several characters, is higher than revenue gained from said subs.
---
Fishing in Tanaris. &gt;_&gt;
---
I think it's just mountains. They never developed it.
---
We killed him twice at 0800 in the morning without any Horde competition. God my Pants so I don't have to bother anymore.
---
No way! I had the covers over me! - Beavis
---
This is how i do it, and keep in mind I’m full bis geared except my swords are dalrends and my chest is cadaverous. As combat spec, you garrote the dwarf and pop evasion, one point slice and dice into blade flurry/adrenaline rush. After evasion and blade flurry run out, you are going to blind the dog. This is the tricky part here because you could lose your combo points blinding the dog, you want to make sure you spend your combo points on an eviscerate before you blind the dog. Then you chug a superior healing potion and finish the dwarf off and loot/vanish. It’s very tricky as combat spec and pretty rng, sometimes I just have to vanish out and not kill him. Sometimes a thistle tea can mean the difference between a kill or not, but seeing as swiftthistle is 1g, I usually just vanish. 
---
As hemo spec it’s much easier. You cheapshot the dwarf into evasion, 5 point cold blood eviscerate, blind the dog when evasion runs out, then you use prep and cold blood/evasion/blind again and the dwarf should be dead pretty easily.  
---
Superior healing potions and blinding powder can be easily farmed pickpocketing mobs on the way
---
My attendance is flawless!
---
The only major difficulty I've experienced is a lack of pvp while leveling. Prior to 60 I spent about 40 hours flagged while questing and had a grand total of 0 fights (STV Tanaris, Plaguelands). Once you're near 60 you can find some interest though.
---
How do Shamans make gold?
---
I think it really depends on the rarity of items. If it's a quest reward or something craftable, probably worth picking up. If you're getting into the droprates of 10, 5% or less, then maybe some alternative might be fine. Just because you get into a raid doesn't mean something will drop for your class, and also doesn't mean you'd be able to get it even if it does. Certain items you might be stuck with for a fair while depending on RNG and loot rules.
---
People will still do MC when Naxx is cleared... I don't really see the point here.
---
I'm a lot more sick of every single PvP related comment having a ton of people screeching "PVP HAPPENED FHIOWEHFUIEWFEW GO PVE CIOFWHIOFEWJOI RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!".
---
Every single complaint involving PvP in any way gets the same response, it gets old really quick.
---
&gt; PVP still happens in the world.
---
In my experience, no it doesn't. On my PvE server, I've never seen anyone flagged for PvP in any zone other than hillsbrad or BRM.
---
looks fine
---
Winamp and imageshack what a throwback
---
After rain comes sunshine, always remember that.
---
On Westfall, there's a general understanding that world pvp will happen in tarren mill / southshore, and that griefing quest givers for either faction is a no-no. There's exceptions, but nothing at scale.
---
The great thing about PvE is that you opt when you want to pvp, and when you don't. The alliance are the majority, but horde are still common.
---
I will go with head, legs ( as i already have them) + gloves for disarm.
---
Honestly, It's probably gonna feel like you're just throwing ur money into the fire
---
But, you will atleast be making progress, and when you're decently close to having it all you'll appreciate it
---
Unfortunately I can’t. I wish blizz would just release instant 60 boosts already
---
I usually warn the priest/healer not to bother about me unless I'm AoEing or SUPER low health. I'm affliction spec. More health is just a drain life or death coil away (or a health stone, pot, whatever). I usually only top up with food/water before bosses or events. Sustain on a warlock is sick (esp. with Dark Pact between pulls).
---
Or, you know, Blizzard could find a way to fix the broken servers?
---
Okay but why not extend that lockout to IP address then? Why make it account based? I leveled an entirely separate character and they're linked in this weird lockout system, that doesn't make any sense.
---
Decided to try to run get into BRD as fast as possible without using stealth on Skeram as alliance. Went about as well as you might expect...
---
You should stream and make this your career
---
Power level...9000
---
There is no necessity.  Anyone saying that is full of shit....
---
Alternate title: How many people here are part of the problem?
---
Fair fights in phase 2 are an exception, not the norm. If you want fair fights, you gotta wait for battlegrounds.
---
that's why we have spy Add-on ;)
---
Holy shit you are the dumbest person on the face of the planet. Nobody who goes for the drakestone need Jed trinket HOLY SHIT.
---
I was lucky enough to have time to level prior to phase 2, but every time i see a dead level 48+ of either faction with a raid group leaving the scene, I wonder just how long people are going to bother even trying. This guy probably logged out in everlook, a guarded city, to go questing when he logs back on, logged in and was instantly met with the decision of taking rez sickness and hoping he beats the raid to the flight master, waiting and hoping the raid left (It's been \~30 minutes, they're still there and he appears to have logged off), or logging off.   
---
Someone who isn't level 60 yet clearly doesn't have a ton of time to play the game, and I don't think they want to waste it corpse running and being camped by groups of 15+ people.
---
10th according to a blue post i saw on blizz forums
---
Apparently drop rate isn't too bad. Just recruit some help and farm for it in winterspring
---
according to pop estimates it’s craaaazyyy imbalanced like somewhere between 70/30-90/10 in favour of alliance but i don’t play there so can’t say for sure
---
Are you butt hurt?
---
Westfall is one of the busiest servers oveall, coming in second only to Pagle. Although if you're horde side it may seem less.
---
OMEGALUL IM HOrde
---
I definitely won them lol. Our God does free roll most of the time or if theres 30 or more people the leader will do a roll 1-# of players. That's how I won the 4th bag
---
This is inappropriate.
---
How are they rushing content? Its been 3 months since launch and it’ll probably be closer to 6 for BWL. Its following vanilla releases pretty close. Did you really expect blizz to just let people spam MC for a year? Active player counts are already tanking
---
Forgot we were all supposed to just publicly hate retail since this is the classic wow reddit.
---
I can't imagine playing druid without it
---
You’re*
---
you can easily zone into ubrs as a raid of 40 and zerg to bwl. you even get another chance at jed and rend
---
They were probably already exalted
---
Threat meters are essential and don’t work correctly now. Class/role leaders need accurate data on everyone so they know who is underperforming and why and how to coach them. I could give more examples but these alone necessitate a reversal of this change - at least in instances.
---
That’s not how proof works. That’s like me telling an atheist that god exist and saying prove it or I’m right. The only concrete anything we have is blizzards official response to restrict alliance from transferring off. If I wanted to Match your unofficial evidence I would say go to official forums or this reddit and look how many more complaints threads are alliance hating the game on pvp servers. And again go to brd on any of these servers and see the alliance being farmed like cattle. There are alliance dominated servers, few and far between and usually the droves of alliance who transferred when they could from hellish unbalanced servers in the first place.
---
Is it only me that stopped play my Main to level an alt in phase 2 ???? I have a good time on the alt, playing my Main is boring and kinda pointless playing on atm when i got so much on him, its nothing to do really
---
I don’t think there is a solution to this problem. If you make it hard to catch up you have a situation like Naxxramas where guilds were poaching tanks in order to complete the content.
---
This is just false. This alliance bitchfest is beyond ridiculous. Just this evening I was part of a 10-man horde PvP raid that went around the world looking for fights. First we went to Feralas and got camped by a 20-man alliance raid. Then we went to Felwood and the same thing happened. Winterspring was horde-dominated but also pretty empty, so we went to EPL where two different alliance raids completely ruled the entire zone. BRM and the gorge were held by horde, but while we were there fighting, some people in our coalition called us back to Kargath because an alliance raid was literally inside the inn killing everybody in sight. This is the most balanced EU PvP server, and alliance have a solid presence around the world. When we fly a group somewhere, we have to time our flights to land simultaneously because half the time it's horde camping the flight point and the other half it's alliance. Quit your victim complex and stop running around BRM alone or whatever the hell it is you're doing.
---
At least you didn't spend your Friday night alone ruining some random strangers time.
---
Threat for one. Threat meters aren’t accurate now. Also class/role leaders need accurate data in growing/progressing guilds to know how to coach people.
---
blame yourself. if people dont listen to critic just remove them instantly. 99% of people dont play WOW since yesterday so its allright to take action because this is as pathetic as wiping in lfr raids in bfa
---
basically just think of it like 1 spirit will be 30% better for your character than 1 int, the starts are weighted in comparison to each other for how much they’ll ultimately benefit your character based on simulations
---
You're a healing shaman? You literally don't need a single tier-1 piece. The healing gear you can get from diremaul is insane and often better than your tier1 gear. Get diremaul gear+the robe from Baron Riverdare and you're good to go.
---
People in classic wow are about to learn the same lessons the devs for Eve Online just finished learning. You can not force players to function as farming targets for a larger group, its quite literally impossible. Sooner or later they will get tired of paying to be someone else's punching bag and when they do they will leave. And as  some people start the quit the server balance issue becomes exacerbated resulting in more people leaving.
---
Yeah I don't know why I've gotten latched onto. It's getting to the point where it's feeling like harrasment, but I guess I signed up for this (though not the wallhack part, that was not part of classic PVP).
---
Thanks for letting me vent.
---
Got it in the badlands myself. Sold for 250 day after :)
---
A bank alt on a separate account is very convenient, since you don't have to log out to check AH, and can directly trade stuff to yourself without waiting 1 hour for mail to arrive.
---
Leveling an alt on another account is also better since you can carry yourself through dungeons.
---
A character on another account is handy for spying (checking how many people are in each zone, for instance), and to check their AH for deals you can't find on yours - i.e. if you need a particular item that's not being sold on your side, you can ask whoever's selling it on theirs to put it on neutral AH.
---
Damn I only sold mine for 50
---
I don't understand the see through wall thing. Please explain
---
Rare legendaries create an issue with class imbalance that classic wow just didn’t care about. Current retail is much more concerned about class balance. I still remember the drama surrounding the rogue dagger and mage staff during cataclysm.
---
Ok boomer
---
If you turn around and attack it occasionally then you can keep aggro on it.
---
A guy playing a female toon with a red halter top is pretty accurate, too.
---
don't worry in a few weeks Pkat is going to be bitching on the forums or reddit about how the wait for BG's unbearable for horde players and blizzard needs to do something to fix the problem and you can just point and laugh at him.
---
Naxx had tank poaching because one fight required 8 tanks. That wasn't a catchup issue. It was an issue of fights have very different requirements from every other raid.
---
The freshest PVP addon "Spy" works really hard to show you where other players are, in a way that would not be accomplished through typical skill.
---
The issue is OP is adamant that it's "100%" accurate when that's nearly impossible. The "census" was only done over 10 minutes, players were most likely double counted, players may have logged off early in the census period but were still counted, players could have been missed for numerous reasons, doing /who may have missed people entirely, etc. 
---
Collecting data like this is decent for a very rough estimate at best. If OP would frame it as such, it would have went over a lot better. Boldly and repeatedly claiming it's "100% accurate" is just bullshit.
---
The dwarf is extremely terrifying haha
---
I mean there isnt much advise to give lol. The Arcanite bars are going to be a huge undertaking. You will need to grind your ass off nonstop saving everything you have. The hardest part is that P3 weps pretty much beat out Surfuras so it's one of those things that you must really want.
---
See if your guildies can help out.
---
Not sure what the incentives were back in 2005. It is obvious that they operated differently with WoW being their main product.
---
So what do the stars represent?
---
I got every Jed/Rend group like this. Find Jed and start my own group or find the group already fishing for him. Always had a group ready like 5 mins after finding him
---
not today
---
I thought 12k was max per week?
---
At least they’re not killing you in the town. My buddies were killing alli in the town one night. It was a good time, every time we ran from the guards. Unfortunately the guards will run forever if you use an ability on them so you may still die lol
---
Are they really that bad?
---
You can’t tell people they should have rolled on a server specifically made to address the issues they might have on other servers. That’s considered blasphemy here.
---
Main tank wants like 240 FR just from armor for rag, but can get away with a little less. Abilities add the rest.
---
You'll switch in and out of FR gear depending on the boss but probably keep it on for the elemental trash/dogs.
---
The logic is simple: how much money do we make if we create this website vs how much money do we make if we don’t. If the existence of this website does not increase revenue in some form (increased subs) then they can just leave classic as is and not develop this type of leaderboard.
---
That might be the reason, but it feels weak. Classes on retail aren't well-balanced at top end.
---
Both screenshots are fine. I can read everything. Next time don't insult people when you're clearly in the wrong.
---
At the price you sold it at, you probably won't be able to afford buying it again. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
Honor came out 8 days ago
---
I didnt deem anything, its been random people posting on reddit what the lowest life forms. Its changes depending what post you read
---
at first glance, you have the 2nd worst uptime of slice and dice of all the rogues, but managed to cast it more time than 4 others. That says to me that you're letting it fall off far too often, and you're either refreshing it early, or forgetting to re apply it and refreshing it with very few combo points when you realize its fallen off. This alone is going to make a huge difference in your dps, because if you look at the total damage of your top rogue over all the fights, white damage is 48.25%, so not having your auto attack buffed with slice and dice is the biggest dps loss a rogue can suffer. You were second overall on number of eviscerates used and damage done with eviscerate, which further leads me to believe you're ignoring slice and dice in favor of using evis, which is almost always going to be a damage decrease.  
---
You also used your Adrenaline rush the second least of any of the rogues. You had 7, the highest had 12. You also cast blade flurry 8 times, where as your top rogue got 14 casts.   
---
You cast sinister strike 151 times total, and had a higher average hit than another rogue, but he placed higher overall damage wise because he had 23 more casts than you. Of course without looking into each fight individually or each persons number of bosses done, shadowcraft procs, teas used, etc. it's hard for me to determine exactly why you're under using your buffs or under casting your abilities, but these are all things you can work on to improve.  
---
I suggest a slice and dice timer or something to make sure you remember to always have it up. Even if it's about to run out and you only have one combo point, you're better off re applying it, building up 5 more points and refreshing it at 5 combo points, just don't refresh it too early, you can always pool energy and wait for it to be about to fall off and re apply it.  
---
I also suggest a swing timer and energy tick addon so you aren't wasting any auto attacks by proccing sword specialization on a sinister strike partway through a mainhand swing. This would mean you wait until just after an auto attack with your mainhand goes off before you use any melee abilities that could proc a sword spec like sinister strike or eviscerate.   
---
That's all I really have time to look at right now, but i promise if you fix your slice and dice uptime you will see a very noticeable difference immediately.
---
Next time go fuck yourself, cunt
---
What’s really been strange is that we’ve been running MC with different guilds.
---
&gt;Unless people stay subbed for longer due to this, creating it brings no revenue, only costs.
---
Exactly what I said. 
---
One important aspect to also consider is the timing of these gains. Gains that are too far into the future are less attractive since every extra dollar that you do not spend today can be invested today.
---
I’ve been going between that, frost nail e’ko, and mature blue dragon sinew. After 30+ I had no arcane crystals D:
---
Alt-itis is a real thing
---
Dungeons...this has been a known fact for weeks. WPvP will dominate until BGs are released. 
---
You can’t die to PvP in an instance. Sure you’ll die 2-3 times traveling there, but with a good group you can do multiple runs earning more xp than doing anything else.
---
A tauren paladin and priest of equal level attacked me and kill me unaware. I run back, and because I am an OP mage I was able to tear the paladin apart, but left the priest alive so he could be ressed (the run is pretty brutal). 
---
Priest res, they kill me again, so I kill the paladin again. Priest isn't here this time, but a level 60 rogue comes riding in and begins to gank me over the next hour, killing me 5 or 6 times and being particularly crude about it.
---
That is the story.
---
Perhaps not the place for such a discussion but what the hell. In vanilla when I played I tried out almost every class except paladin and druid. I created so many ALTs and just played them mindlessly, never really learning the class, it's unique mechanics, etc. It was a completely different experience from this time.
---
Now I picked a class, a rogue, leveled that rogue got the pve gear and the PVP gear and decided I am going to play this one character and that's it. 
---
Made me appreciate wow more, you can play it deep as a puddle but wide as an ocean or deep as an ocean and wide as a puddle
---
And....scene!
---
DW man I'm 56 with almost 20 days played... Atleast half of that is afk time tho
---
yeah, just "bad tanks", totally not the fact that DPS spamming execute generate way more threat than a tank, definitely
---
Why the fuck does my powershift macro keep leaving me in caser form, despite having mana to shift?   
---
Is this happening to anyone else?
---
It keeps happening to me, and it's pissing me off.  Might as well not even bother powershifting if this is the result.
---
Our guild has gotten 3 bindings this past month. Never an eye though.
---
If they continue to maintain it like they currently are (i.e. no leaderboards, etc) I most definitely WON'T continue playing it. It's not that the classic "dream" failed, but Blizzard as a company is hot garbage.
---
This is why I’m watching movies instead of playing. I’m so over this.
---
There's always rogues running around undercity and the portal trainer area of UC ambushing people they can kill in a cheapshot or ambush crit and vanishing before they get caught. At least they're easy to get away from once you die once though.
---
Absolutely they do.
---
Ok so no parses then?
---
That's odd, because a lot of people in this thread are looking forward to him/her/it. What do you have against ol' Maggy?
---
This is my favorite comment on the thread. Thank you.
---
&gt; People who play any game can complain about any aspect of it
---
If you don't like PvP, you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server. Downvote me all you want, you know it's true. If you roll on a PvP server and then whine and cry about PvP happening, it's your own fault. Whining about PvP isn't going to solve your problem, rolling on a PvE server will.
---
&gt;and look for ways it can be improved
---
Can't be "improved" without making non-vanilla changes.
---
I didn't know about such difference in timing. Maybe you should try to add:
---
/dismount [mounted]
---
So it should skip /dismount on next clicks and it would help to stealth faster.
---
So I have a few things to point out, maybe it will help you.
---
- Have your tanks buy their own flasks (obviously, lol).
---
- Sell materials and Sulf Ingots on server (Sulf Ingots usually sell for a few hundred to 500g+ on most servers).
---
- Sell BoEs that no one in your main group needs (e.g. locks don't need belts any more).
---
- Sell T2 helms, leaf, eye and other items that no one else needs.  You can easily get several hundred gold for a BOP item when/if it drops for someone willing to pay for the chance.
---
- Sell all the greens/blues that drop during MC for cash to fund flasks.
---
Do you think it’s easy to differentiate between a player controlling 5 screens and an AI controlling characters for you?
---
No shit they make money for it. Lol
---
They really don’t. Molten Core is almost exclusively Frostbolt and yes there are fights to AE that you might want to switch to a less Frost specific set but even then it’s marginal: arcane explosion only has a 14.28% coefficient.
---
You should always be prioritizing frost SP.
---
To be honest, I expected that link to still show horde as a joke and maybe include like 1 alliance rogue tucked in the middle somewhere.
---
none , no changes
---
&gt; this isn't pvp, that is pvp
---
Gatekeeping, ok. WPVP isn't BGs. Because of the lack of structure, it can take many forms.
---
My main is a shaman and when I started leveling a warlock alt I called my imp a moving Searing Totem
---
you don't know what he's going through. get real.
---
Replace Rend with Hamstring though if I recall.
---
I don't think threat is showing in logs at all. Also most tanks, especially for speed runs seem to go for pure damage and 0 mitigation. I'd wait till vael to see who fares better for infinite rage, and probably aq for a better situation.
---
I'm no vegan but I'm with ya buddy. It ruins the game - I'm not doing it, end of story. It reminds me of layer hopping... people going crazy talking about nochanges then abusing things that fundamentally change the game. Tisk tisk. We'll grow more in skill playing against people who have this, at least there's that
---
Those are from the addon Rare Aware - marks the locations of rare spawns.
---
It is possible to make a "pseudo" Spy that only works for a given list of enemy names by attempting to target them, just like unitscan does. But there's only so many names it can check before it starts overloading the client.
---
But it's based on a bug in their API and they can easily fix that if someone tries to abuse it further than unitscan already does.
---
Correct, also opens up dagger build (although ages core leather is slightly better).
---
Also both the bwl axes look amazing. I'd put crul up against any weapon except maladath/the hungering cold in the looks department
---
2 greater fire pots both used on rag. 2 restorative potions, used on lucifron and barron. 2 greater arcane elixirs. Rest isn't important. Maybe a major mana for garr if your gear isn't so good yet and one for rag if you get lucky and avoid most of his damage.
---
I say do it on servers that already allow horde transfers.  Or else we’re going to end up with a bunch of pve servers.
---
Hey y'all can do it man and fuck the haters. I started 3 weeks after launch and got insta invited in the starting area and my guild was literally a meme guild. Me and the boys on thunderury, and we talked so much  wild  shit in chat regular people would leave and then we said fuck it, let's get serious and somehow our crazy asses now have 3 raid groups going to MC and Ony weekly and I swear to God I thought it wouldn't even be like that. I also helped out  and helped get shit moving with some of the guys too but once you get to beating MC, it'll be awesome.
---
oh yea... maybe you can zone in 15 at a time?
---
My guild is doing round Robin with the bags.  Seems more fair than one person taking 4 of them
---
Piss off pissant.
---
Zug zug!
---
You can make a cast sequence macro i believe but nothing that will register what it is then change it based on that. That would be a bot
---
Are you leveling or 60? In general, Crit is huge for enhance and is what I would prioritize. Of course attack power (whether it be from strength or plain AP) is a huge factor in damage, but thankfully a lot of the best in slot gear you’ll be going for at 60 has both Crit and attack power. Also know that if you’re 60 and raiding etc, this advice is after you’ve already hit your hit % cap. 
---
That second priority you listed is terrible imo. Even though spirit isn’t completely useless for shaman, it’s still not nearly as helpful as other classes, and should definitely not take priority over crit.
---
If you have the chance to stalk them for a while, you could maybe wait until they lose their barrier at some point and ambush them then. If they blink, run in the opposite direction, take cover, and restealth.
---
Rend has always been more efficient for me - couldn’t tell you why exactly
---
Vurtne hair &lt;3
---
That's true but we were also clearing it when it was a 15 man with people half afk'ing wearing t0 or greens not hit capped with janky ass specs and 0 idea of what a rotation was.  
---
The reality is most people were dog shit and 15 man ubrs was not something that was difficult to clear by any means. I found scholo and strat harder in vanilla once they went from 10mans to 5 mans.
---
Lol
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zuH8srcwE0
---
original version of this meme.
---
It's difficult to make a statement, though, because the current threat values for druids are simply not known yet. ClassicThreatMeter used TBC values as place holders as of not so long ago.
---
The whole druid tps thing was researched empirically on LH's core. So the results are confined to LH's servers until further verification is available.
---
Warriors have insane potential to scale and none of those claims accounted for recently discovered new warrior techniques such as HS toggling. Nobody even verified Thunderfury's threat component, yet.
---
I find it already questionable (but reasonable) to assume that druids currently outperform warriors single-target in a buff capped environment. It might very well be the case, but IMO the reason we see a bias towards druids on Rag is that they have better tools to deal with his knockback.
---
I find it almost impossible that warriors with their scaling won't siimply outscale a feral druid in a mere tps perspetive for the highest tps possible in the most hardcore guild possible. Guilds might be able to push the offensive potential of tanking gear to new levels.
---
All that being said, as someone who healed a lot, I do prefer healing druids. They are very good tanks for Naxx, at least on the servers I played on. Situationally, they are without a doubt the optimal choice.
---
I am just saying we need further verification for a druid's threat component.
---
No need. Blizzard did exactly what I said above to fix the issue.
---
Fuck capitalism man. It's just a race to the bottom. Nobody gives a shit about the experience and improving it for the sake of improving it.
---
The lock is hurting you anyway. Either putting more stress on the healer, or making downtime longer for them so that they don't have to bother. You can point them in the right direction. If they stubbornly refuse, a few deaths is the right stick to beat the lesson in.
---
I'm on Herod.
---
But...it's only 27.
---
I leveled a Mage first and had plenty of gold for my Druid the second time around.  I am currently Lv46 and don't yet have any regrets not buying a mount.
---
Even when gold isn't really a problem, seems like a waste to me.  If there's danger you stealth.
---
Am I wrong if I say I have nothing to do? I need a couple drops from MC and I'm not interested in PvP until BG's come. I basically raid log and do a bit of world PvP just to rank up.
---
Just realized this is also the new U.S. immigration policy. Long queue as you wait in Mexico for your asylum hearing, or you can apply for asylum in some other country.
---
Because people went on high pop servers complained about ques being too long.
---
Then honor comes out and people complain about how people make it.
---
In honesty yes I think they should butcher honor gain while in huge groups or find some patchwork solution.
---
But it's also a completely acceptable decision to ignore the complaints from people because after a while people will stop camping for honor.
---
Just a surge of people who power leveled early on or leveled in a reasonable amount of time coming back to classic due to P2 hype who will leave in a bit.
---
Still waiting to see a epic world drop, soon got two level 60’s and not a single one has dropped
---
Blizzard made the change I described, the combat log doesn't tell your things you don't need to know now.
---
I am not paying for the extra drinks these warlocks makes me go through, so if some asshat decides to instead of sitting and drinking between pulls to lifetap down to 30hp you can bet I wont be healing him.
---
its not something you see that often and if I get mage water I generally tend to keep people tapped up regardless of their tapping habits. 
---
Expecting someone else to cover for your cost of running a dungeon is frankly disrespectful.
---
As for the additional burden for the group, turns out these dimwits are also terrible at dealing dmg even if they have mana so its generally worse for the clearing speed to heal them too, go figure.
---
We didn't use an addon, we were in vent and counted down and everyone queued at the same time. Maybe we did it wrong but we got 3 guys in our group to grand marshal.
---
It is indeed!
---
Not sure if it works on Classic, but I found on forums  /cast \[@cursor\] Flamestrike
---
I never said anything about a combat log? Also you brought up an FPS, which is WAY faster paced than wow is. You have 1.5 seconds to determine your next spell or ability which, honestly, isn't hard to do. Are you gonna build rage/combo points or spend it? Interrupt? CC? Pretty easy to tell what to do. FPS is much quicker, the fight is determined in that same time frame. 
---
Watch a mage fight. CC, frostbolt, cone of cold, poly, wait and eat.
---
Watch a rogue, open with cc, gogue/blind, wait, restealth and reengage.
---
Watch a warlock, fear, dot dot dot, fear.
---
These aren't decided in less than a second and typically you know how the fight will go so you can predict what to do next. 
---
An FPS is all about location knowledge. If you know where the other guy is and he doesn't, you usually will win, 99/100
---
In wow, that isn't nearly the case. Even with spy telling you a rogue stealthed nearby, you can still lose to the rogue. You can open up on a mage and they can turn it around and kill you. Because location knowledge isn't nearly as important as you're making it out to be.
---
I was in Quartz on AN from beta before moving to Oops in phase 2. Those players were all ace!
---
Also came across some of them in the beta for classic, was lovely.
---
I leveled to 55 as enhance before switching to resto, and loved it. IMO 40-50 is a great time to be enhance, with all your sweet SM loot (especially if you’re using ravages, which is just plain fun in dungeons as enhance).
---
The attunement is free if you are exalted with argent dawn and now we have the benefit of knowing that ahead of time!
---
I think both work great. I think leveling I like a little more agility but still a lot of strength, especially if using a shield. For pvp inwouoda say agility for crits. 
---
I have dabbled with both for leveling and they are very similar.
---
Yes and you FD with the pillar between you and the king, putting the spectator with LoS. But you break FD with a drink so it doesn’t matter. But this stupid shit doesn’t matter because the point is is that the spectators aren’t vanilla and were added in classic due to hunter farms. Fuckin noob
---
Anyone else see Kabuto?
---
Just stay at distance and let us burn our Mana.
---
Star wars memes are always a joy
---
It's the reddit turbo virgins that are crying about this shit every day. I play Alliance on Herod and I don't cry about it, BGs are coming out very soon. The current honor farm is a unique experience. If you aren't 60 by now or don't have friends/guild to do battle in the open world then that's your own fault. 
---
Blizz catering to babies that whine about every slight inconvenience is the reason retail went to shit. 
---
Cry.
---
Classic in general shows that blizz didn't really think a whole lot of stuff through. But, that's modern day blizz in a nutshell. 🤷‍♂️
---
there are no other website that tracks it? if enough people want better UI i can make one
---
Got better. I'm more critical about what I choose to spend time on and when, and slightly more attentive in general. We picked up a couple of healthy hobbies for the weekends, too.
---
doing DM tribute runs as a Solo hunter is pretty hard to actually pull off.
---
[Tobias:](https://youtu.be/k_8Qi-P2jQg)
---
Not really. You can farm other things better. There are so many fish bots squids and oilys are worthless. Eels are like 4s on herod
---
Not sure they have factored your decision into their projections.
---
Bananas
---
The leaderboards?
---
Tanks aren't going to wear full tank gear this time around. They are going to wear lots of dps gear and they are going to use stone shield pots. Being tankier and generating more threat. They will most certainly spam execute and hold agro lol as that is what our tanks did in vanilla. BA is also 100 % dmg increase. The only people who might pull agro on vael will be the people who get BA, but that won't be the dps warriors it only goes on whoever has agro and mana users.
---
i would say its not worth imo
---
Not unless you bot. But even then you’re looking at 20-30g an hour until you flood the market.
---
Anyone saying congrats should really be ashamed of themselves.
---
The last thing a newly unemployed, depressed person needs is to hole themselves away for every waking hour for 12+ weeks.
---
But sure man.
---
Also you're a ROGUE. Like literally the absolute worst class to rank on, my god, you dont get anything but weapons from it.
---
&gt; "Blizzard says it's okay" is such a lame, low effort rationalization.
---
Its literally all the rationalization anyone needs, no one needs your validation for how they play the game.
---
Go try setting up isboxer or something similar, and tell me how its so easy that everyone would do it if &lt;insert random reason here&gt;.
---
Life goals.
---
-Summoning stones like in TBC
---
-AOE loot
---
-Barbershop(no race/name changes)
---
-As a druid being able to talk to people while shapeshifted and being able to shapeshift into other forms without having to first shift back into your normal state.
---
Man, I was telling someone how cool the old site was and there was something so cool about all the internet culture and how it was the wild west back then. Blizzard would put WOWRadio on the front page and didn't make a dime (ok maybe a few bucks) and brought people like Totalbiscuit to so many. It also reminded me of a raw forum like reddit where there wasn't a light show and just solid info related to the game. It was like a hobbyist website dedicated to wow and it just doesn't have that feel any longer with the community. It's just all catered to making that money and selling pets and mounts.
---
Except the basic change of server cap that was made caused this issue. So yeah, if the #nochanges people had it their way, this wouldn't be happening.
---
probably not. My guess is they expected classic to bring in a bunch of players and then they would try and keep them playing retail after they left classic.   
---
I think they're gonna have a reality check when people get fed up with the lack of classic support and don't transition to retail like they hope
---
I heal for raids and tank instances at max level. You’re either gonna want to go with a 30/21/0 build or 20/31/0 depending on if you want to be better at tanking or healing. Reduced mana on seals and judgements isn’t worth it imo and ends up not making much of a dent in your mana consumption. Consecrate will always end up using almost the entirety of the mana that you used during a fight.
---
Paladin tanks are very gear dependent. If you need more agro you need a few key SP pieces. If you need to take less damage, stack defense. If mana is becoming an issue, mp5 or just straight up intellect can work out for you.
---
Idk, just looks like a video of you being outplayed to me, should've rolled PvE server if you can't take the heat.   
---
/s
---
Yeah but some random Horde died once when they were trying to get to blackrock depths a few days ago so clearly both sides have it bad.
---
The ally on stalaag are masochists I swear. They like live for the uphill battle and do their best to make some horde lives miserable.
---
It is hard to define what the role of a company is. I do research into corporate social responsibility and I am a big believer in more than just profit-maximizing, however, I also believe most of the corporate social activism is motivated by reputation building and ultimately selling more to consumers who buy into the company's mission.
---
But then how do we know this data set is good?
---
And do you believe there was a 20-40% change in demo’s in 2 months?
---
Real original 🙄
---
Donate to my Hand of Rag fund.
---
Not so good now, huh?
---
Funnily enough "common" was that language in the (now non-canon) World of Warcraft RPG. A common (eh? eh?) Trade language to be used amongst all the races, with even relatively unintelligent species such as gnolls being able to speak at least a bastardized, simplified version of it, which is called "low common".
---
Yeah because it's not like they've ever changed their policies on other things based on enough customer feedback..
---
Which is exactly what I said.
---
My point is with burning adrenaline and essence of the red + execute range being a much larger part of the 1 million hp compared to rags 1 million the guilds who kill rag in 2 minutes will be able to do 1 million on vael in half the time because of the huge dps increase you get from the fights mechanics.
---
You can't read I guess. Raid farming randoms =/= wpvp.
---
You should point out what server you are playing on!
---
Good luck
---
Yeah dude, you could have left at any time. You don't owe people anything.
---
Gotta pull the cord and hearth sometimes.
---
This game is already enough of a slog without idiots making it worse.
---
Imagine two pieces of toilet paper.
---
They are the exact same product, do the exact same job, if you weren’t paying attention you would notice a difference.
---
Except one has an alien face on it and is 40% more expensive.  That’s Alienware
---
It does work, you just need to wait around. Got him a couple times live side. Much more common ud though
---
We play together, so we've been spending more time together instead of one of us watching tv and the other one gaming.
---
Why do you feel like they missed out by having a cool open world elite zone to quest in?
---
Not to be a dick, but I got it on my first run ever, and won it in a 3 mage party.
---
I might have used all my character's luck on that one
---
nah super hardcore guilds have geared as fuck fury/prot warriors that are actually skilled and build enough threat in the first 3 seconds of the fight(and continuing through the fight) to never come close to losing threat, even to a geared fury warrior doing 1.2k dps lol
---
It’s only worth it if you bot.
---
It’s a problem lol, I want to level them all, but there’s not enough time in the world lol. Also I get really sick of durotar really fast
---
my guild is like that, but we have quite a lot of players who only play, idk 10 hours a week? if that? idk how they do it but still. it sure as shit helps to play it like your second life but it isnt always essential to play 30+ hours a week and be a good player in a hardcore raiding guild.
---
Many NPCs are universally understandable even though they have no reason to ever interact with players of the opposite faction. Some NPCs even have some lines that are "localized" and some that aren't.
---
It’s pretty hard to detect and you could get around the detection pretty easily. Ultimately, the best method they could use is to punish multi boxers by banning them and the fact that they don’t is quite obviously because someone is paying 5 times as much to play the game. 
---
I’m looking forward to seeing 5 Shammy multiboxers deleting people in av. good memories.
---
The tram is an instanced hole in the wall.
---
Thank you! Lol
---
He sits in kargath killing afk players, dying to the mass of horde, then repeat, 12 hours a day. In^sane
---
It's fine man, just download Google Chrome Remote Desktop and start the game up 45 mins before you're home.

Back in the day I never got anywhere near high level, and had a handful of alts that I never really learned.
---
This time I have twice the amount of alts and I really learn a lot of theory about each one of them quite deep (and take it to practice as their level allows). The fact that I've been consuming class guides like crazy for almost a year prior to classic launch really helped with that.
---
I'm not super hardcore (i don't even have a 60 yet, though I'm close on the rogue), but I thonk it's quite possible to play it deep and wide as an ocean if you invest enough effort and time :D
---
its funny because this comment suggests you never read what the defense skill gives. Otherwise you would know why it is about as useless as spirit for a bear druid..
---
yeah wut? you can't really compare rag and vael because of the huuuuuge dps buff mechanics on vael. if a guild is killing rag in, lets say 90 seconds, they are gonna kill vael in 30 lol
---
Most Mages say 20/31 is best for ranking because you do more damage and therefore get more honor. But when BGs come out everyone will be back to imp cs since it’s too valuable for BGs.
---
Farm the patches of elemental water in bay of storms and sell the essence of waters you get. Profit.
---
Honestly fishing is great for a heal spec who can’t respec all the time - such as me. :) 
---
On Grobb, prices for eels, oilys, and essences are insane so it’s a nice little side profit.
---
Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but you can just make pet follow and stay hotkeyed to something like ctrl+scroll up and ctrl+scroll down. Super convenient.
---
welcome to stone shield potion its 2000 armor which is the equivalent of putting on a shield.
---
if you're horde, then yes
---
To be honest I’m not sure which server on even on lol 
---
Thanks !
---
You are a saint. I'd have left after he argued about dispelling.
---
Spy only notifies you when players enter stealth, it can't see already stealthed players.
---
no he made it at least 4 times better.
---
heartwood is well protected
---
The absolute most you can possibly get someone to pay for them.
---
Look them up on your servers AH, if there isn't any. Start at 1500g then take the highest offer you get / are comfortable with.
---
If I don't get my true strike shoulders in the next 5 ubrs runs I'm going to kill myself.
---
I'm not using it, it needs to banned along with mods like Kill the Healer.
---
Combat log data has been shrunk to 50 yards, so Spy only shows enemies within 50 yards... which you would be able to see anyway if they arent stealthed or invisible.
---
In fact it is less advantage, than having 4 more people under 1 leader. Multiboxer have problem with fear effects and fights involving spread movement. Their support toons usually are heal bots and stational turrets. The only strength is instant focus if target is in front of direction multiboxer is moving his group.
---
escort raid. either get your guildies not raiding that night to escort you into MC or if your guild isnt big enough to field 80 60s at once then try and coordinate with other raiding guilds on your server to either escort eachother at your different raid times or just all go in at once with 120+ people
---
That last one is doable with macros thank god
---
Great, if this is the case I can't wait to use it. Poor dagger gets a bad wrap in PVE.
---
What are the forums that support these macros and softwares nowadays? This was a great way to level when recruit a friend gave 300% XP and I had no friends :)
---
If he has herbalism then he's better off farming Swiftthistle. Quicker to farm, sells better, sells faster, and the demand never drops.
---
Yeah this attitude of always pleasing the fickle shareholders is cancerous as fuck.
---

---
To answer your original question and to speak to the previous point, Vivendi and Activision merged and eventually Activision bought majority shares from Vivendi. Blizzard as part of Vivendi has been typically seen as something that fostered the idea of creating and atmosphere and a community, things that don't directly bring in subs but all contribute to making something that's legendary. Activisions goal has always seemed to drive earnings and investment each quarter. Makes sense they might not bring it back if there's not an immediate financial benefit or a loud enough community voice.  
---
    
---
As to why they originally created it vs now. I'd say mostly because back in 2005, WoW had just become the new EQ and really took the MMO genre to the next level, but who knew how long it would last and what would come next? They just had to push to be as best as they could in the face of whatever might come their way. 15 years later it turns out, nothing better came.
---
Competitive in raid with 2.2 speed axe from scholo and 1.7 axe from strat.
---
You don't *need* to spend that gold at all. It just helps.
---
True, and I think you nailed it on the head there - there's a time commitment to playing as you said, wide and deep as an ocean. That's not something I have had the luxury of but it does give praise to wow, it is and was a masterpiece of a game that you can enjoy it at so many levels based on the time and effort invested. I cannot say that is necessary true of other MMOs.
---
Are you wearing edgemasters with tanking gear?
---
end up with a bunch of pve servers? what do you mean?
---
lol HW as fury. You’re gonna get R10, buy the blue set and call it a day
---
More DOTS!
---
I wish people understood that when I’m in a group.  I bring a lot more value than my crappy number on recount says I do.
---
Using both is the best. Might till &lt;30% mana, then switch to windom till you're &gt;80%, and keep switching back and forth.
---
It *is* one press = 1 action for those of us who understand how software works.
---
1 press = 1 action across n windows.  You aren't pressing moonfire and then suddenly going through an entire cast rotation of moonfire/wrath/starfire with your hands off the keyboard while you sit back and watch the fireworks, *that* would be bannable automation.  You could do the exact same thing multiboxing software does to emulate keypresses across multiple game windows with some extra hardware, but people get all up in arms when its done with software for some reason.  My assumption is because of ignorance, people tend to get pretty up in arms about things they don't understand.
---
Unlocking kul tiran humans is what finally did me in.
---
Not only did I have to grind a ton of rep, I had to wait for an arbitrary patch that time gated my access to it for pretty much no reason. And to top it off, the quest chain held on keeping me playing to the point of where you have to walk a long distance for one of the last parts of the quest while picking up logs that slowed you down more and more. It was pretty obvious once I was walking uphill at like 20-40% move speed that they just wanted me logged in longer
---
2 seat mounts, I would easily pay for taxi service while leveling
---
Why I also rolled one I didnt have the investment and honestly I'm still a low level who has leveled multiple classes to 15 to find the one that spoke to me.
---
I rolled a PVE because I knew I wouldnt be able to compete with people who already had builds ready and experience previously
---
Everyone on Faerlina should be permabanned
---
Of all bis items the glad chest is the one you should go for since it’s bis for over a year.
---
okay.
---
It’s still kinda like that on rp servers
---
To be fair they're doing the thing people always get annoyed at villans for not doing.
---
Kill the heros while they're young and dont let them a chance at escape.
---
Lol is that a subtle Princess Bride reference?
---
Haha. This is my go to quote when people whisper me.
---
I just discovered that horde have it easier to hit certain ranks too. The cutoff for R4 last week was 74k for Ally, 50+ for horde. That's a huge gulf and exacerbates the imbalance in the other way of what I'd expect
---
&gt;thrall in oggrimar.
---
Why do Alliance players have such difficulty spelling "Orgrimmar"?
---
Whats the strategy for the mage blinking into the Garr fight? I've not seen that before, so I'm wondering what the objective is there?
---
Do people actually go to gym EVERY day? I thought it should be like twice or thrice a week to let the body to heal and grow. I"m far from being competent in that field tho.
---
Whatever dude, I've taken so many headsets/keyboards/mice back to best buy and just pulled a brand new one off the shelf because I bought the $20 warranty.
---
I know how Paladins play. I'm specifically talking about PvP. And afaik, extra hit chance does not do a lot in PvP.

Handy Notes!

---
Make sure to grab the classic version (right side of page).
---
I remcommend making a macro for "/hnnew" -- just click it when you want to make a mark on the map and it'll place the icon where your character is standing.
---
I mostly use it for things like this - marking trails and such that the world map doesn't make clear.
---
I’ve never seen so many resists.
---
But Blizzard already has the function as a toggle in their fucking UI.
---
I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding on how small sample sizes can be and still offer accurate representation.
---
I think OPs methodology is reasonable and he explained why his numbers should be much more accurate than the site's.
---
If you guys want more data points, maybe ask him how he executes his method so you guys can go and do a daily scan yourself rather than doing...whatever you're trying to accomplish here.
---
Again thanks. Are 2 top end daggers viable for a warrior dual-wield? Or main hand should always be a "bigger" weapon?
---
You don't have to be an RPer to enjoy people having normal, interesting or flavorful names rather than cringe lords being xXenigmaXx or 12 year olds being stabmedaddy.
---
Yea aesthetically Azshara is one of my favorite zones. Everything other than aesthetically... fuck that place.
---
Naaaah, better save that mana for balance weaving and later powershifting to top the meters :DDD
---
Ironfoe is BiS for priests that want to talk to dwaves
---
So it looks like you’re doing a majority of your HKs solo? At 185 honor per kill average.. where are you farming?
---
That makes no sense.
---
Of course it's a fucking rogue. Grats on being overpowered at world pvp I guess.
---
Must be a dogshit server.
---
No its not. Depending on your class, any endeavor you take on needs to clear around 25-30g an hour. Also if you have mining, you can easily make that if you farm thorium relatively uncontested. *Especially* if youre something like a rogue, you cans stealth into the tunnels in silithus and farm the rich thorium with nobody bothering you except mobs.
---
Oof. That was a solid fight. As a priest who has my only cc on a 30 second CD this feels wrong.
---
It'll be great for killing generals in AV.
---
Then you can just get The Hog.
---
At least you have the option to transfer to anoth.... nvm
---
You can't really go ele until level 39 when you can get all points in the cast time reduction talent for lightning spells. The spec is absolute garbage before that. It shaves a full second off the cast time of LB and CL. That's literally a 50% DPS increase.
---
His wording is stupid. He meant that you press a button and your character does one action. Every one button press equals one action, just on 5 characters. If that one button press now would equal 2 actions on 5 characters it would not be ok, because it would mean one button press would translate to two presses for each character.
---
Basically when you press 1, it presses 1 for everyone. Which is fine. It would not be fine if you pressed 1 and then it pressed 1 and 2 for everyone.
---
Found the bitch
---
Is there a good 1-60 leveling guide? Addon or online. Used Azeroth auto pilot 1-40 last time. Heard about joanas guide but that just 1-12 for free from what I could tell. My current character is at 53 and struggling hard to find quests. Also going to start an alt at some point soon
---
What a monumental waste of time.
---
Rule 6, Low Quality Meme.
---
I dont see anything wrong with that. Guild is just a group of strangers, why should they be more important to you, than your own self? Just because we are in the same guild doesnt mean we are instantly friends.
---
Did you read the part about being put on short term disability leave for his depression and suicidal thoughts?
---
I NEEDED YOU TWO WEEKS AGO!!! But thanks this is super helpful.
---
You're right, all your examples show that they just cater to the biggest noobs while surgically getting people hooked on late game content which is constantly replaced in the next expansion, and keeping people busy with daily chores until the next expansion, keeping them subscribed monthly and literally just using people to advance their own toon since community is meaningless and you can solo from 1-120 without even talking to anyone.
---
WoW Classic is simply one of the greatest RPGs ever designed, and the best MMORPG in history. A small part of its success stems from the great story of Warcraft 3. If you look at retail wow, the lore is now rather convoluted and lifeless. It's no surprise they're remaking WCIII now to bank on the classic nostalgia.
---
There's evidence that non-instanced dungeons were going to play a major part in WoW, but the idea was backed away from most likely due to issues found during beta testing.
---
Jintha' Alor was an experiment that they decided not to follow up with in later content. There are several locations in the game which are obviously meant to be party content. Any of those horrid insect hives, Winterspring demons, Blasted Lands demons, these areas need a party to fully clear the content. Although this didn't end up being a big part of the game, the idea that non-instanced party content should exist is there.
---
As for dungeons. Deadmines: the final boss on the ship. That area is behind a closed door in stranglevale, it too was supposed to be an open air "dungeon". Diremaul was treated the same way, designed with the intent of being non-instanced, but in the end closing it off.
---
There's plenty of NA guilds and players but yeah, a lot of BR to go around too. I've made the language barrier work in parties though
---
Creepy dwarf face. I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Wanna trade?
---
A couple come to mind.
---
1) A Rogue friend and I were farming Arena/Angerforge for the chestpiece (I'm a warrior) and Hand of Justice.
---
Hand of Justice drops on second run of the night, I win the roll. Next run we do, it drops again and he gets it.
---
2) I won Bonereavers Edge with a roll of 4 this week.
---
Fingers crossed his name doesn’t get reported. I wanted to name my hunter beastdiddler but I didn’t want to chance the report
---
I just find it fun that i complete another tasks, its satisfying to see the quests in the zone completed.
---
BiS for the entirety of vanilla on raid bosses if you misclicked on character creation (i.e. didn't pick human or orc)
---
shoulda been a blue dranei
---
Hinterlands.
---
The screenshot is compressed for me too - it's almost impossible to make out the words and numbers. Chrome mobile.
---
Okay so I'm having a bit of a wow crisis right now. I can not raid for IRL reasons. I'm a 5 man tank exclusively and I went out and spent 365 gold on the Edgemaster's Handguards because they're supposed to be BiS. My problem is someone in another thread said they're worthless for 5 mans and only help vs lv 63 mobs. Did I waste my gold? Can someone explain this to me? How much hit do I need to get soft capped for 5 mans? Meaning up to lv 62 mobs. I didn't notice any misses since equipping the gloves combined with my +3% hit chance from gear. I was told by a guildie they were equivelent to 3% hit so that combined gives me +6% which should be soft capped vs lv 62 mobs. There's so much false information out there Idk what to believe.
---
Honestly after going through all the effort to do my cleanse poison quest, I specifically started looking for poison debuffs to dispel even though those generally are just negligible dots at low level.
---
My only theory is that you are trying to shapeshift too soon after an action. I believe shapeshifts are technically on the GCD even though they don't trigger the GCD themselves. If you do anything that triggers global cooldown and shapeshift too soon your macro won't be able to carry out the cat form shift.
---
And that's why I run my own raiding guild. To build a community of people who come for the game and stay for the people. 
---
Your mindset is perfect for that of a mega guild. And that's fine. Nothing wrong with that if it works for you and the people you play with. 
---
However, you would trim yourself from my guild. Our goal is to progress as efficiently as possible. Gear the guild not the player. Who will make the most impact with that item. Not loot counciling gear also helps keep your mindset at Bay.
---
What makes you think he doesnt already have all bis?
---
The music just ruins the whole video
---
There is no unique farm that shamans can do. Best guess is probably doing duo jump-runs in diremaul east or simply farming Satyrs in Azshara.
---
Totally agreed, there's something special about being level 60 and slowly completing all your quests. Then you have free time to explore the gorgeous world and can rally to your factions cause in pvp or just continue fill a viable needed role in raids, not just based on your skill, but on your personality in guild chat. That stuff just literally doesn't exist in retail, people don't explore anymore, besides to do daily chores, or to get the exploration achievement.
---
&gt;"People arent playing the game how I want so it's not the real game"
---
I have no argument, so I'm going to say some nonsense that sounds right.
---
When you're on the character select screen, look at the top right of the screen, above the names of your character(s) and you'll see the name of your server, [like so](https://i.imgur.com/OZrDmkJ.png)
---
Germs the GOAT ❤️
---
yes, if you are a druid that's exactly what our guild's OT uses
---
Bots are a factor but it’s also because raid content is so easy atm. In p4+ I expect the price of eels will reach 50s-1g each.
---
I'm in that boat right now unfortunately. 
---
I didn't remember the community (in-game) being so toxic via camping lower levels. I was expecting PvP, but whats happening is not PvP.
---
Just wish blizzard would offer transfers to PvE realms. All my options are other PvP server :/
---
Hopefully BGs occupy most of the trolls attention.
---
neither, you go 0/30/21 for that sweet double iceblock
---
Your troll to the right with redish-pink hair, looks just like mine did in WotLK days.  Enhancement Shaman, she brought the bloodlust to ICC.  RIP Tetons, may you forever serve whomever I sold you to for 180 bucks back in 2009.
---
Ahem... I for one at LEAST get my alt to level 6 before never playing it again... so...
---
Three people I give absolutely zero fucks about, have my downvote.
---
That was my plan if my flight wasn't delayed. Lol
---
That was so awesome to watch! What a shame! You won.
---
It's a feature that adds value to the game. That added value makes players happier and keeps more of them subbed. For some players the entire game can become focused on their ranking and placement on the leaderboard. The minimal cost of maintaining a leaderboard would definitely be made up for in sub retention.
---
This. On Whitemane, Horde dominate area right outside BRD daily but once you pay us out honor a few times, you can level in peace.
---
Something about your dwarf’s face tells me “call 911 if you see this suspect.”
---
The ‘turbo virgins’ would be the people who have more time to tolerate being camped 24/7. The people that are raising this issue are people who value their time and have more important or things the value doing more than staring at a gray screen waiting for their res timer to end.
---
It honestly baffles me how you can see first hand how bad the situation is on Herod and not be capable of understanding how it isn’t fun for the majority of people playing the game.
---
I’ve played a disgusting amount of WoW since it launched and was ALWAYS starting shit bc I love PvPing but what we have now isn’t traditional PvP. It’s the smaller faction getting honor farmed
---
It's not exactly unique to shamans, but between water walking and far sight, they're the best class for Azshara essence of water pool farming.
---
AFAIK, most mages just go frost aoe spec and take down a bunch that way. Using that method, dmg reduction is okay, but not really needed. Maybe your suggestion could optimize that?
---
Warrior by the way, horde can't be paladins.
---
Quest chain starts here btw: https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3844
---
Using Cold Snap before his polymorphs on a 2nd minute would save a minute of life for you and hundreds of minutes for another redditors.
---
What a trite and condescending reply.
---
Hi man , I had an alliance guild in shazzrah . On peak times we were 30ish people online but now we are 4 at max. They all rerolled on pyrewood. I’m still in shazz cause I don’t want to leave my bis paladin but as u said , I can’t even go out from IF. It’s not safe to stay in SW since the flight master it’s camped almost 24/7.
---
Feeling like a rat in a cage. 
---
Guildies that are rerolling are happy tho, so I guess that’s a good thing. They all are more relaxed and enjoying the game.
---
I can’t reroll since I don’t want to lvl up another paladin and quel’serrar / redo epic mount quest etc. HF man.
---
Sounds like you haven't played on a 1:3 server before &gt;&lt;
---
My guild is killing Ony with 20 person splits. We don't need the help. They are paying for the invite.
---
Yeah for 5% mana. And it's a lot weaker.
---
i bought warding almost as soon as dire maul opened. I have never seen the stoneshield cloak drop or being sold, so why bother? the mats are easy to get as well!
---
Which is stupid because crossrealm bg’s didn’t exist for 90% of retail vanilla. Leave it to blizzard to ruin one of the most important aspects of vanilla pvp...community.
---
My alt is almost 32, I refuse to touch my level 50 main with the mega gank squads running around, lol
---
they do but they wont and this will frustrate them quite a lot. Good. i hope it will last. :D
---
blizz fucked up the server pops a bit
---
This doesn't change the fact that defence as a stat us pretty much useless. Some tanks know it, others buy defence gear.
---
No, this one [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13944/tombstone-breastplate](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13944/tombstone-breastplate)
---
Let’s just say you have 30 people in ur raid each time. 3.33 % chance each time. My boi either you layin or you gotta hit the casino and throw everything on one number.
---
&gt;And do you believe there was a 20-40% change in demo’s in 2 months?
---
If the data was incomplete then there might not be a change, just under reported original numbers.
---
1hand for pve single target damage and a 2hand for pvp?
---
If youre in a dungeon have windfury totem dropped for your party you could even set up a weapon switch macro to stormstrike on your 2hand and switch back.
---
I keep on hearing the hype but in reality the 1 hand outperforms
---
Same.
---
That is a fucking minus 50 dkp
---
every name is either a pun, or a random verb/adjective.
---
I'm not the raid leader so I couldnt tell you. I dont think it's so much as absolutely needing 30 people rather than just doing it to play it safe maybe? Most of the time we have about 20 to maybe 25 people. This night we just got a lot of extras I guess
---
I will have to look in this...as deep Resto on a 50/50 High/Full pop server I cannot farm anything in the world right now...
---
might be tough for you guys to get through BRM but you guys give hell everywhere else like on the way to BRM at LHC and Wintersprings id say wintersprings is a more even ish match as hord will take it for 10 min then alliance takes its back its a more fun flowing battle. also Alliance are at teh bulwark almost all day everyday.
---
I never claimed it was any more than that, retail just represents the downward spiral of quality in the video game industry, which isn't exactly a good thing if you care at all about video games.
---
&gt; including having to literally round up the combat logs of every individual raid member to provide to you
---
lol you dont even know how logs works. if you get the log of 1 raid you can see the gear of EVERYONE. he just needs to link ONE (the latest raid)
---
everyone can say bullshit online, whats the issue of actually proving? literally just link the classic.warcraftlogs.com log.
---
I mean...have you ever asked a lock for a HS? He’d probably give you one... meanwhile we’re always keeping the healer soulstoned as well so you don’t have to run back
---
Oh, so you wanted some nostalgia trip, I see. Maybe you should try private servers, they tend to have smaller populations. Or maybe try a low-population Classic server.
---
That stat website isn't particularly accurate.
---
Calculating back from the pvp ranking I got week one, between 4000-7000 horde players got 15hks and were included in the rankings.
---
Population wise the server is fairly balanced, but I feel it has a horde edge. No more than 55/45 split, alliance definitely win pvp in certain areas and on certain days.
---
As far as realms go, it's a pretty good example of an "average" classic server. Pop seems about where the devs intended it, pvp is won more often by horde but the alliance hit back pretty hard on a regular basis.
---
An equal ratio doesn't help you much when all you do is sitting in IF.
---
It only happens sometimes, maybe 1 in 5 to 10 shifts.   I've also only noticed it in combat.  I can spam the shit out of it out of combat and it always works.
---
But if this is the case, then why aren't other people reporting it?
---
Dual spec or lower cost of respec, to make changing spec between raiding and farming (more) viable
---
I'm a dumb because I never realized the UBRS and LBRS are the same dungeon. Has anyone ever done the entirety of Blackrock Spire in one go?
---
Or you can learn mythology to actually get some cool names :) Though people always take the easy way out, so they are bound to just take the first name that wasn't already taken.
---
on the off chance that you are being serious Arugal has a 43.2:56.8 ratio over the past 2 weeks according to [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) Its literally one of the most balanced major servers in the world. Its quite literally nowhere near the same experience.
---
Youre doing serious damages as fury, but youre squishier and do not have MS.  So all in all, not bad but arms is definitely better.
---
One of the reasons the Zandalari/Kul Tiran races were delayed is that they were not finished. Specifically Kul Tirans iirc. Zandalari stuff was in the beta. 
---
That nonsense about a single quest designed to keep you logged in for longer is 100% foil hat bullshit.
---
&gt; show you where players are
---
Please provide screens of it "showing *where* people are"
---
Should've gone with "high frequency autistic" in the title.
---
So what's the deal now- is Asmonbald just stirring some shit or is he actualy frustrated with getting outplayed and farmed?
---
It was certainly greater than 50 yards.
---
It felt like spy could register someone before they were rendered. You could notice it on things like flight paths. You would get a notification for a something like a "30+" hunter and then a few moments later you would see a gryphon flying overhead with the hunter.
---
This is the best option
---
HonorSpy works on you anyway, for the record. You can see other people’s honor via inspection and honorspy just automatically inspects everyone you see.
---
I'm almost positive spy could pick up things like players on flight paths before they were rendered.
---

SPIT IN MY MOUTH!
---
So you're saying a whole bunch of unrelated people are calling you an asshole, but you've done nothing wrong? [Right...](https://i.imgur.com/Q19laLc.png)
---
The odds are close to 0 that someone would get the UBRS key in 1 LBRS run, also UBRS is a 10 man dungeon and LBRS is a 5 man, so I'd say no
---
Slightly off topic, but is there an addon that puts all your portals/teleports into 1 button that you can hover over to open up a portal menu or something like that? I don’t like the idea of having 6 button slots taken up by portals
---
It's funny because he's 7 levels higher, blew all his cooldowns and still died. Paladins are so shit in solo PvP.
---
Well u were scamming him if you paid 52g as 2/3 of 80 gold
---
I actually found that platform. I was not trying to, I was lost as fuck.

Neat little set piece. That region is gorgeous overall, would get lost again.

Innervate is best saved for that moment when your group accidently pulls a patrol or something and the healer runs oom in combat. Unless you're going with a team of your long term pals, y'all are die-hard professionals, you're cooperation is top notch, your every move is precise and perfect and you *never* *ever* let the situation get out of control.
---
Engi is the most picked crafting profession by far, expecting it to be a moneymaker is far fetched tbh
---
It's pretty much supply / demand, unless you can convince people to buy what you want to sell you're not going to really sell anything. There's really no good answer and whilst yes, repair bots are useful the ones that would need them probably already have them.

People pay absolutely stupid prices for free action potions when you consider how easy it is to fish oily blackmouths (as an example).
---
Very likely is that your hitting it too fast and all it wants to do then is /cancelform.  Instead here is a better macro:
---
    #show Prowl
---
    /cast [stance:1] Dire Bear Form
---
    /cast [stance:2] Aquatic Form
---
    /cast [stance:4] Travel Form
---
    /cast [nostance:3] Cat Form
---
    /cast Prowl
---
This macro will now detect what form you are in and shift you always into cat and stealth you.  It says if I'm in stance 1, Bear form, shift me out by casting that form again then, since you are no longer in any form, cast Cat Form.  Finally then cast Prowl.
---
    #show Travel Form
---
    /cast [stance:3] Cat Form
---
    /cast [swimming] Aquatic Form
---
    /cast [outdoors] Travel Form
---
In this example we will always shift out of either bear or cat and then into the correct travel form for our current situation.
---
Someone didn't read the title...
---
Listen here you little shit, all you have done is follow OP and shit on him whenever they say something. Yet, you cannot add any sort of value to the conversation other than bogus bigoted nonsense. JuSt QuIt. What a fine choice of words for a piece of shit such as yourself. The way that you think and talk makes it seem you fit the horde mantra better than those alliance badges younger flying. Go fuck yourself and have a wonderful say ;)
---
Yeah, but you should also be aware of where you're standing with a SS. In our first MC attempt, we wiped 3 times on majordomo and wasted 3 SS on a healer who kept dying near the boss despite us repeatedly asking him to stay back.
---
I hear allot of my guildies talk about 60/40 split Horde favored. I think it's allot closer than most people realize, and that people are having a biased opinion. Last night our 3 man squad was killed by a horde 10 man. I remember this. I don't remember every Alliance squad that passed us, followed us or fought alongside us.
---
I'm fairly certain it's horde sided on our server. On classic.warcraftlogs there are 39 listed Alliance guilds uploading logs vs 50 horde. If this is indicative, then we are looking at a 1.28:1 ratio or 43.8 (A) to 56.1 (H).
---
Checking level 60s is not a good indication in my opinion. The top 10 fastest MC clears on the server are split 50/50 between the factions. Horde holding 1, 3, 6, 9 and 10. Alliance holding 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. I'm not sure about the Horde guilds, but i know for a fact two of the top Alliance guilds are split raiding with each member being required to have two level 60s. I got two level 60s myself split raiding, and i know several guildies with 3 level 60s. I'm not very active with the second 60 either, so it's probably counted in census systems less frequently.
---
Keep in mind that the census page, showing different data for 7, 14 and 30 days could be due to people transferring away from Mograine. As free transfer was opened and is still open as far as i know. Could be we lost more Horde than Alliance, which would be great for the overall server balance seeing as the more recent data shows a better distribution. 50/50 being ideal of course, but 45% to 55% is as good as you can hope for.
---
vael is actually going to be one of the easiest fights because the biggest difference between classic and vanilla is the dps output of the raid.
---
With optimized talents and build players output so much more DPS now, as I said the gear check for vael is 1M dmg in 3 minutes, exact asme as killing ragnaros before phase 2 but with dmg bonuses and no anoying lava bump.
---
The world first nefarian kill took like 25 minutes just so you realiaze how low the dps was lol
---
In the process of creating Vanilla and over time Blizzard discovered the perfect formulas to plug into their skinner box.
---
Vanilla devs had dreams of a world but slowly built a prison. Retail Devs tirelessly shove you into the prison.
---
Fuck off
---
I disagree with summoning stones because Warlocks.  If warlocks didn’t have that spell, I’d agree.
---
I also didn’t know druids couldn’t talk.  That’s very intriguing!
---
Why not aq20?
---
When doing ony atunements with my guild we would often smash through LBRS afterwards the if anyone needed anything from there - its very fast with 8+ people
---
Yes , good, good, let the hatred flow through you.
---
bro that dwarf. are you okay?
---
It limits combat log functionality in general, not specifically Spy. It technically brings Classic closer to parity with vanilla WoW, as retail has a 200~ yard logging range but vanilla was 60 I believe. 
---
And ironically, in practice it is a buff in diguise for Spy as it returns more relevant alerts for nearby stealth users.
---
I mean, the cross realm bgs won't totally fix the issue.  The horde will still be waiting.    In fact, it might accomplish next to nothing if blizzard doesn't pair pve and pvp servers together.
---
Is there a BIS list for ele/resto that only includes mail gear? Interested to see what it would look like
---
im very confused
---
1.10 gear isn't available.
---
Most of the updated gear in classic comes from patch 1.4 which waas the world frist ragnaros patch
---
stop spreading misinformations 1.12 doesn't make it that easier
---
Bro it's 3am East coast and I got killed at morgan's vigil by horde. THEY DONT FUCKING SLEEP.
---
Awesome man, glad to see some positive things happening for someone in the community. I too deal with my share of ups and downs, maybe one day we'll both feel better. =)
---
I have not performed any analysis and I do not know what is the right financial decision. Nevertheless, yYour decision to go ahead with a potentially costly project should be based on more than a guess. I highly doubt they even have the data required to estimate the benefits of this system.
---
Solo DME jump runs as 31/0/20. 30-100g p/hr.
---
You'll need herb and mining however
---
Do you have the item equipped or just on your bars?
---
Nobody says its impossible. It is impossible to "break" without breaking other addons.
---
Why would you reply to a post you clearly didn’t read?
---
She does 3-4 fireballs for us and our OT manages to pick her up every time. Critting while in defensive stance does insane amounts of threat. Your comment is what I meant when I wrote that people give overly advanced tactics for this boss.
---
&gt; Impossible without destroying a lot of other add on functionality.
---
&gt;No, it's not impossible.
---
My mum loves her pve server and she is trying to get my partner to reroll alliance there  with her. 
---
She has flagged up a few times with friends for mini skirmishes. Said it was fun and got rank 2 from very little wpvp.
---
was wondering more how there wasnt any pvp going on on the way there. even if its 2 am
---
1H + shield in a dungeon as an offtank (or even the actual tank) is totally fine. In a raid situation, you won't be tanking any melee hits, so there's no point.
---
In PvP you would ideally use the 1H + shield against melee and swap to a 2H against casters.
---
It was a tameable pet in early vanilla that got taken out
---
Great thanks for the help! Now I guess I need to decide if I want to keep consecration or not. This will be tough, it’s such a fun spell, especially as an AOE spell for a melee class. But do I really want to spend the talent points. Hmmm.
---
I dont get it?
---
True but you'd think since it is, people would be buying the mats like crazy for their alts and also leveling to 300 twice to take advantage of gnome/goblin bop items so I'd expect mats to be very expensive but apparently not. On my server, Horde, 20 Thorium bars goes for maybe 7-9g. I think you need around 225 bars to finish the 200-300 leveling.
---
Lol it's the same on my server.  I run around in 2-3 man squad.  They either run if they don't outnumber us by 2-3x...or leave completely after they've lost one fight.
---
because even outside of obvious additions like tier 0.5 and ZG, all the other dungeon and catch up gear that was added in later patches isn't available either.
---
Both perfect. We looked before replying. Notice we responded without insult.
---
Abusing those who are telling you the screenshots are ok isn't going to fix your actual problem.
---
Same, but then again I've never run strat without a mage AoEing like his life depended on it.
---
Yeah, I would definitely do a mage first. I leveled a shaman first wich I regret.
---
Why?
---
Gold, gold and some more gold.
---
In classic you will need to farm either for raids or just in general.
---
A mage is sooo good at both leveling and farming, it's like... A basic class that everyone needs almost, in my opinion.
---
Perds and cht is on par with viskag/brute in single target. Where daggers struggle is on cleave due to the lower topend which really hurts whirlwind dmg and cleave dmg.
---
 This is a small problem due to mc being the main content atm and mc is cleave city. Luci, geh, garr in some strats, sulf, domo not to mention trash. The proc is also fire dmg which a lot of bosses are strong against/immune.
---
Bwl however is largely single target for bosses, so daggers is very competitive with everything but crul and cts. Viskag would pull ahead with maladath but that's rare as hell.
---
Aged core gloves are insanely strong for daggers. Only gloves in game you wouldn't replace with annihilation assuming daggers of course
---
Daggers get a big boost in aq with deaths sting and pugio. Aq sword is pretty meh, aq axe is decent. Really the aq combo is mace mace if ur human. Then sting pugio. 
---
Again though it suffers on cleave. At that point you should 100% have a good 2her for the relevant cleave fights (bre, utb are choice). Still mostly mc though, really the only boss cleave is razoregore adds, nef p1, nef p3 zerg.
---
Aq is not much cleave really just fank.
---
Because WoW was the biggest game on the planet in 2005.
---
Blizzard had incentives, as well as money to Burn.
---
Google "weapon skill versus bosses" to find the right info. Look for the charts with miss % and glancing blow damage against 62s and 63s (raid bosses). The easier calculation is for dodge, parry, and block: it's .04% per weapon skill for each, just like your defense skill in reverse. Since you're tanking, you benefit from all three instead of just dodge.
---
It's also relevant whether you have extra weapon skill from your race. But having edgemasters can still help if you don't happen to have your race's weapon type.
---
Would suggest this as well you will need to farm a lot and mages are by far the best you could also farm gold and buy good items for your “main”
---
Depends on what you can do with the fish. On my realm (Lucifron) just the fish alone doesn't sell well and will most likely be more profitable to just vendor it. But I also got lucky and got a recipe crop in the Barrens to make those deviate fish into meals that transform you into a pirate or ninja for an hour. Those in the other hand I can sell in stacks of 2 for 75s-1.5g depending on the supply/demand.
---
Why isnt Grid 2 options working? The error msg says that this Grid2 is for retail. But the actual frames are working.
---
Today running LBRS, we had rogue, hunter, Druid tier .5 gloves, traveler’s back pack, and pattern for robe of the archmage. I won every one of them.
---
This is 100% incorrect. Spy monitors the combat log and alerts on activities. It does not and can not tell you anyones location. It alerts you that an action has happened (because it is in your combat log) and tells you where YOUR position was when it alerted. I can’t speculate on the wall hack situation.
---
How about: Fuck up cunt
---
A gaming subreddit that’s 90% bitching and complaining, absurd i say
---
My priest is named Nutman. SFW if you ask me. He just wants those nuts, man.
---
Edgemasters + 6% hit chance is what you need to be hit capped against level 63 enemies unless I'm mistaken. For level 60 or less you only need 5% hit chance. I keep edgemasters in my inventory and equip it when I see enemies are higher than level 60 like most bosses for sure.
---
Good choice there fellow. I boosted my alt with my mage all the way from level 8-60 but you obviously need a second account for that
---
Read my answer to e-jammer.
---
I don't think you understand how dkp is earned
---
All your damage has increased threat in defensive stance. Popping recklessness assures that high threat abilities such as Heroic Strike will crit. You dont have to believe it, but have your tank try it out. Last fight was 4 fireballs, tank ended P1 around 11th on the threat meter. Onyxia didnt even target anyone else when she landed, OT was on her the second she descended critting heroic strikes and bloodthirsts.

Did he died
---
It’s whatever you prefer. They are both very strong.
---
I run either 17/0/34 or 0/18/33.
---
Arcane/Frost is better vs casters, the 10 spell pen, 10 spell resist and 5% mana gain and improved silence really help me in matchups vs casters.
---
I find 0/18/33 (or 0/20/31 if you prefer) to be very strong in groups. I also do better vs melee. The added burst potential and the amazing impact stuns make for a very fun build. Only thing is you really have to time your counter spells well vs casters, if you get juked, you’re fucked.
---
Time to read the tooltip on your trinket
---
9/10 rogues I find didn't show up in spy and I simply discovered them by riding near and hearing the stealth sound
---
You must lead a bitter and frustrated life.
---
We have a lot of raid deaths that could be avoided if he was actually trying. It's easy yes but dying still sucks. If he was actively participating a lot less deaths would occur.
---
Great work man. I wish more people would run these.
---
With multiboxing, one person can press a button and 5 nukes (or more) can land on your character. Meanwhile you hit back and can only land 1 nuke for every GCD with your character. 
---
Do you understand it now that multiboxing grant a person the power to shit over you?
---
&gt; Ok but we KNOW that changes arent going to happen,
---
They've made changes already based on how people are playing, like changing the guards range in BB/GZ/EL. I don't disagree with your sentiment, but i don't have any faith that Blizz won't change more things and i don't see how anyone "KNOW"s anything.
---
Usb power on short haul, 220 volts on long haul.
---
15-25 players in 2-3 raids, all doing this. Had one wipe since then.
---
I was looking at some realms as well, I will be playing horde, and wanted to get on a very populated server, and so far the ones with alot of activity seem to be pvp servers, which I'm not sure which ones to join yet...?
---
Druids can use Faerie Fire on Garr (which is a nature spell).
---
I use it, If I had to choose, I'd prefer it to be gone, but I don't mind it that much.
---
This is like the third or fourth time I heard someone saying warlocks can vanish, is that just coincidence or do warlocks get an ability in later expansions?
---
Only does 11% of hp
---
He whispered a guy trying to invite him to his guild. The guy is not interested in joining his guild because he’s a GM of a different guild. So it’s his alt and will obviously join his own guild.
---
Step 1) Be rogue  
---
Step 2) go to enemy faction Capitol city's  
---
Step 3) Murder  
---
Step 4) Murder some more  
---
Step 5) leave with out dieing  
---
Step 5 might be the hardest but if you can pull it off then not even their safe zones are safe any more.
---
Third time's your fault tbh, should've given it to someone else
---
Middle of threat meter is quite low unless you let Ony do 20+ fireballs in p2
---
Then you absolutely should go Arms.
---
Yeah, we found sitting around 10th spot is perfect for our amount of DPS.
---
But the map already has a marker to avoid problem areas. It says "Azshara" right there so you should know to avoid that shitty zone.
---
because of inclusivity
---
Thank you! This sounds pretty solid.
---
Well said
---
I bet you also buy gear that says 'daddy likes leather'
---
He sounds bad, you sound like an asshole.
---
A spy-like add-on was part of vanilla.
---
I assume it uses spell hit %. So what spell hit do you need for pvp? Was it 5 or 8?
---
Mage at 28, hunter at 30, warri at 24 and dudu at 19. decided to delete all of them and roll on a different server completely new. My rogue is right now 26. don‘t think I will stick with him until lvl 60...I never tried pally btw..
---
You're a shitty rogue with heals.
---
You're a shitty warrior. With heals
---
Youre a shitty healer. With best form and stealth 
---
You are the best and worst version of all the classes.
---
You are the "ugh no shield wheres my priest" and the "omfg druid innervate priest and saved us all"
---
But you wont hear that 2nd bit. Just know you did it. You captured the flag. You healed your healed and tanked when your tanks couldn't. You dpsed in cat and at range with moonfire.
---
You will capture 3 flags. Then the group will ask"is the druid doing anything? They're not even fighting in the middle of wsg."
---
You'll be flamed. And made fun of. But in the end you'll win. You wont be congratulated, more like commended for not ruining everyone else fun.
---
Even though you won the BG pretty much alone.
---
Then you'll que up. And repeat the cycle of druid.
---
Nobody wants us. But we do their own jobs better than they can; usually due to lack of trying.
---
But damnit. I'm still better than your shitty leather wearing ass dual wielding "tank" that people want over me;a fully geared pre bis druid HotW spec.
---
Constantly asked if I'm resto spec.... even though HotW is better healing until phase 3.
---
Nobody understands druids except druids.
---
And we make others hate us.
---
/rant.
---
Others have said it but soy was nerfed hard before your post.  This dude is obviously a tit but he seems an organic tit.  Not an add-on enhanced tit
---
How friendships are made!
---
Lol it really is an addiction lol
---
Kinda feels like Azshara was left unfinished.
---
You don't need to touch thorium at all until 285+ and you don't need to get that high the first time (if you're dropping/respecing).
---
He clearly says that it works sometimes.
---
its not about the wipe its about sending a message.
---
Its good to have a containment server for the strange people that want to play with streamers.
---
There was some dude who hit 40 in every class.
---
Make that 10
---
There is no incentive to hold the boat as the honor gained by slaying the horde decreases rapidly.
---
Holding it as horde lets you kill new passengers on every trip.
---
That‘s probably why
---
Dps warriors have everything from dungeons as well outside weapons and ony neck. Its not just feral druids.
---
I main tanked since the release of classic, and have taken an OT role on Ony. And I can assure you that Im always ending p1 at around 10th on the meter, she always does 3-5 fireballs, and Ive managed to get her threat immedietly as she lands by using recklessness. But I dont do 2 crits, more like 10 crits during her landing animation. Are you fury prot?
---
Agreed with internal resources making 100k this would cost like $500-$1000 to build.  Don't know why this guy is making such a big deal out of it.  It's a single list view web page with a few filters and pagination.  Assuming their website supports css for list views (it does with forums) than this website would easily be built  in 4-8 hours.
---
I think he's just trying to show off his finance phd
---
I am saving my thorium bars for phase 3. When the darkmoon faire comes I am going to exchange like 1k of the bars for tickets.
---
If I have any left I migt sell then. Prices should increase due to higher demand.
---
Once lvled to 35, learn alchemy on your character, make free gold transmuting to end of days.
---
Advice 1. The plural of advice is advice.
---
Just use Rockbiter all the way through. Except for dungeons, where you use windfury or flametongue.
---
Rockbiter gives you the best dps increase most of the time and is the most consistent damage.
---
Seems legit
---
Had to scroll up to see what you meant aand yep. There it is!
---
lol that guy was 1 second away from ending you as well. probably shouldn't be that cocky
---
Honestly thats the funniest damn thing ive seen on this sub.
---
Now time to become no 1 IRL
---
I have feeling my server EU Zandalari Tribe is getting horde population problems. And id like to move to balanced server. You are saying only way to find out what are the active populations is not so accurate addon?  No offence to blizzard, but how the hell people are supposed to know where to migrate if we dont know server populations!?
---
Frostmaul eko's 6 people can farm 30-50g an hours there
---
What class are you?
---
No space on my hotbar.
---
Should make a macro to share it with Health Pots.
---
Shut. Uppp. People want to be in the WORLD of Warcraft. NOBODY wants to spend all their time cooped up in dungeons.
---
Use questie to find quests. If you want dungeons, you can just ask guildmates or an innkeeper what dungeons are around your level. Not sure what worthwhile information you'd expect to find in a leveling guide, but if there's something specific you want to know, just ask.
---
I had a weird moment this week when I got the gladiator chest on my prot pally (noone else could even wear leather) on her first brd xp run. Still missing it on my main after dozens of runs
---
Blizzards API is public. That's how addons are made.
---
What do people think the horde are going to do with 30 minute bg queue times? The roaming death squads will live on
---
I imagine how to feel is how I feel when people say rouge instead of rogue !
---
we've got a prot paladin main or offtanking mc, and 1 druid to innervate him
---
Also what server would be good for horde players ?? I plan pvping and some pve in between I picked grobbulus but I've noticed alot of alliance skulking around more so than horde🤔🤔
---
Qork is king now
---
Ah right, grounding totem, ofc

Unfotunately fights like this are rarity.  Its gangbang on either side every time ;(
---
Must be **loads of fun** and an awesome challenge for you horde! Also very efficient...probably rank 10 already by doing this !
---
Get the stick out of your ass, I was just having fun and laughing as a bro.
---
To be honest, your healer probably just didn’t know. But when you ask ‘why aren’t you dispelling,’ you’re being a dick. 
---
You know there’s no actual good answer. You aren’t actually curious. 
---
You should be telling the healer that the mob is putting a certain debuff on the tank and that is has to be cleansed.
---
When you ask the healer why they aren’t cleansing, you’re going to get a defensive response most of the time. 
---
Think of it like the rivendare mechanic. You don’t say ‘why aren’t you guys killing the adds?’ You say ‘we have to focus the adds.’ When you pose it as a question, you’re asking someone to justify themselves. So their options are to tell you that they’re an idiot or to defend their actions. 
---
If you don’t want them to defend their actions, then you’re just calling them an idiot. It’s not going to create a good group environment.
---
Azjol-nerub my original server except I was alliance!
---
Which leads back to my original comment which notes how that's a disenginous comment and irrelevant opinion because it doesn't take into account the big picture. 
---
It's like saying "nobody is going to die because they skip eating for a day or two" when talking about a person that hasn't eaten for three weeks prior.
---
Nah we undead just like it like that
---
This lense flare screams 'classic'
---
Wooosh :P
---
In theory, there is nothing stopping you paying for the sub. It would still be in his name though. 
---
You’d only have an issue if he decided he wanted his account back, he could “retrieve” it as he has all the account details. 
---
So if you trust him, go ahead. If not, it’s not worth the risk investing a lot of time to the account and he want it back at some point.
---
This isn't that. This is the gamma setting turned up at least double from default, giving everything a washed out, white overlay.
---
I have no idea how you are making this into complicated issue. The picture demostrates roughly the positioning that is commonly used (my guild included) on Ragnaros. In that positioning there is always ranged at max range of the boss on each side of it, because that makes spreading out easier. Because of that melee on the other side of the boss from them is always going to be farther than 50 yards at some point becuase the boss itself is like 15 yards wide and they need to move away from melee range occasionally. You might be able to change your positioning so that everyone stays within 50yard of someone, but few guild are going to start change established strategy just to get clean damage meter numbers.
---
Undead: "Down with the Scourge, revenge for cursing us with unlife!"
---
"But damn their architecture is pretty stylin you know"
---
I assume you are talking about the 1st macro?  Notice the stance vs nostance macro conditionals.  They are the way the macro knows what to shift out of/into.
---
And sorry that I did not say before.  These macros are what I use on my 60 Druid now.  They work perfectly.
---
Copy-paste of post I made a while ago:
---
I  made a simple macro to unequip all items with durability. Change the  22(second to last bag) to 23(last bag) if you do not have  profession/soul-bag. Paste in wow /macro as is.
---
/run arr = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18} for x=1,table.getn(arr) do PickupInventoryItem(arr\[x\])PutItemInBag(22) end
---
See [https://wow.gamepedia.com/InventorySlotId](https://wow.gamepedia.com/InventorySlotId) for slot id's, and add/remove in the arr table as you wish
---
As a professional lumberjack, if you get a sharp enough axe, you can actually cleanly cut the combat-log server on the line between PvE and PvP. 
---
Then you take the axe to the cable to splice it in half, so you can plug them separately into the central command addon integration server. 
---
It’s pretty simple, but of course it’s just one idea. We can always supplement with one of those big bow saws.
---
Same but with Fraiser on the side.
---
I personally use around 120ish FR for Ony, 160-180ish for lava packs, and usually max out around 230ish for Rag/Geddon.  Only difference between Rag and geddon is for geddon I have a pure FR belt that I will put on but for Rag I use belt of might for better stats but a bit less FR.  
---
Reasoning:  For Ony, some FR so you usually get at least a partial resist but fully resisting isn't necessary since the damage on the fight isn't that high and the rage is useful for keeping agro.
---
Lava packs half are FR dmg half are physical heavy that also melt armor so I basically wear my best physical/FR gear.  You generally have a lot of room to play with gear-wise here.
---
Geddon 100% FR dmg so armor doesn't matter at all.  Ragnaros about 66% FR dmg 33% physical dmg but additional FR will help you avoid getting knocked back so usually you want to be near cap if possible (I have done it with as low as 210-220ish buffed early on but you take a lot more dmg and get knocked almost everytime).
---
Raid trash and 5 mans tho, give your boi the hookup.

I wouldn't be happy about it either so I understand your frustrations. However, it's your friends choice though so he can do whatever he likes. If I were you, I would just do what you want to do also. Even though you want to play with your friend, you might not be able to so just focus on yourself.
---
They do if you repeat use  of offensive names, so you get a name change, then get another one that also gets reported. Some people even use the same name again.
---
Not sure how many iterations are needed, but I imagine 2-3 should be enough.
---
Your grp lead can queue while the rest of the grp/raid are still out in the zones.
---
Imagine getting downvoted in 2019 for explaining how public companies are run.
---
Well it was clearly for the better pvp experience for the majority.
---
They are horde who cares. 9/10 has a non rp name and 50% is ud mage lock or rogue. I only feel sorry for killing tauren but than again beef and steak get camped

OP is this on Twitter somewhere? This must be shared further!

NO FUCKING WAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS! I played on this server and was in a guild with Mortaximus, Dalvengyr's last Grand Marshall. Reddit ist ein Dorf.

Fights last 45 seconds they don’t go oom

Hey, we're millenials. Paying off debt in only 1 2/3s months is the perfect fantasy genre for us.

Printed on a plotter. Roughly 1 meter by 1.2 meters
---
Calm your tits mate, the Screenshot is perfectly fine. No need to insult anyone brother.
---
Yes I should respec to Fury right now?
---
If  by some off chance you it's not actually your friend and you are buying an account. Be wary as just like in classic this is what can happen...
---
1.You purchase an account from someone off a website or other means.
---
2. You play on account after changing information on said account.
---
3. Original owner comes back after a few days or weeks and reclaims their account.
---
4. Owner profits, said account was hacked.
---
5. You regret your decision and either 
---
A. Try to buy another .lol
---
B. Level your own account.
---
I write this just in case you are not actually getting from a friend. 
---
Now if you are getting from a trusted friend of x amount of years/decades then you should be fine. As you have probably talked everything out and they have assured you they will not be wanting their account back, adding a sub and playing on it should be totally fine. 
---
1. Most likely enough time has elapsed from their login and ip, and other info data that the new info your setup is providing should not raise any flags to blizzard. 
---
2. If by some chance your friend made their account with a throwaway email on Yahoo or gmail etc. Make sure to get that email from them assuming they only made it for that account. 
---
I wish you the best. I hope this helps.
---
And if it weren't for your slacking you could raid in less than 2h a week. 5h is ridiculously long for MC and Ony.
---
Always respect every warrior you come across, not just fury.

Also, i hope you are playing an orc with those weps

Just a tip: if you're CCed and have Cheetah active, cancel the buff via macro or right-clicking the buff icon so you don't get dazed once you start getting hit.
---
Cool gonna try it, thanks!

Something like that :D
---
Im a surgeon on ER. Soo yeah its shitty because last time i had good sleep was when i was 15yo

Man, I was about to ask this.

im rolling a druid if tbc comes out because of that
---
I think it’s developed but they didn’t have time to add any color to it. Whenever I’m there it’s always in black/white.
---
They probably also forgot to add a background soundtrack, all I hear are ominous whispery noises whenever I’m there...foreshadowing shadowlands??? :o
---
I was lvling in Hillsbrand with my priest, killing bears, lions and other animals for the quests. This ?? Warlock came up behind me and started killing everything I tagged. Im on a pve server, ( Old Blanky?) so I wasnt worried but it was nice of him to follow me a round and kill all the animals for me turning a long grind in a relatively short one. I wish I could remember his name.

Hi everyone
---
Looking to potentially get back into playing classic but I’m not sure whether my laptop will be able to run it…so I’m looking for some thoughts: (Can’t really be bothered downloading one of those “can my PC run it apps”)
---
Below is the link that matches the model of laptop I have with a list of it’s specs:

---
Will I be able to play classic on the lowest quality settings fine with this? (Don't mind quality being low, I just want to be able to raid and stuff like that without any issues).
---
Previously I have played on private Classic and TBC servers on here and the gameplay was smooth, didn’t experience any trouble in raids or anything but I’m not sure how much more demanding classic is now. I also played Hearthstone about a year ago, and think it ran at medium fine.  
---
Thanks
---
I like to not have a leaderboard. In my opinion gaming these days are too competitive. All you do is to fight for rankings and placements. 
---
In Classic I can just chill at my own pace :)
---
Yup am an Orc
---
Mages and rogues do 800 dps but tanks sit on full mit whos tanking? The fury with 1000 dps?
---
What is the goal for the twink. 
---
Also sending over green weaps with good dps is well worth it. 
---
Remember you cant stop xp in classic. So you have to preplan your adventure and be essentially geared before the cap of your bracket.
---
fyi, im standing 6 on my server with 190k honoe and farmed about 80% solo
---
Cross realm bgs will ensure that queue times are maybe 10 minutes at best. I doubt the faction population across all servers in total is that bad. Farming bgs is much better honour much faster, so people will naturally do that more and become to lazy to keep roaming like they do now.
---
Its not better than moonglow ofc, but the big manapoule because of more intellect is good for fights where u have to spam decurse. With gear its not that bad.
---
That's exactly it. This is exactly the issue that makes my blood boil when in pvp situations against rogues. What's even the point of using stealth detection items when they can just walk away before my dot lands on them ?
---
If you plan on tanking. If at all possible when doing dungeons see if you can't find a druid tank and build your own group and dont bring any plate wearer with you when doing ST and up. As it will benefit you to get those tank items for your off spec.

are you joking rn, at no point  is alliance more than horde, on pve server maybe, but given the number of pvp server vs pve, this is not true overall.
---
he wants you to roll alliance on hellholes like herold, not on heartseeker roflmao
---
Patched. They will all follow now. Cant single them out anymore unfortunately.
---
I am pretty sure it works that way. I cast sap on someone right in melee range, move out, and see it applied after a small delay.
---
This is gold! But I see that was already given lol
---
I guess there can be a caveat depending on your faction and server. Or at least I should've said the majority of people wouldn't be
---
I really regret not being a human sometimes.
---
oh well :(
---
reallife friend, we are just afraid he will get in trouble with blizzard and lose his d3 or overwatch or hearthstone (he isnt rly playing those games actively but still)
---
all i need is blizzard not to care about it
---
Wiat, you play with UI enabled? Pfft, everyone knows that **true** wow players  don't need crutches like that to play the game.
---
Imagine taking 5 hours to clear MC+ony
---
That's leeway.
---
It‘s even 34% alliance 66% horde, and i‘m alliance. But as a mage you can win 1v2s and sometimes even 1v3s. You just have to go to the zones where no death squads are roaming
---
At least their comment adds to the discussion, even though you find it very disagreeable and perhaps even condescending.
---
Vanilla designed the reputation system as optional. If a player wants to do it, fine. If not, also fine. The effectiveness of a player in Vanilla/Classic is not hampered by reputation grind. Neither is the fun. Or the social aspect.
---
Jesus what a coward. To run away from such an epic battle!
---
I dream for battles like this. But as an ele shaman without raid gear...you usually die in a CC.
---
I tried to farm Eye of Shadow with 3 of my friends for about an hour. Then I realized that I can either farm this way, depending on help from my friends, for god knows how many hours, or I'll run Mauradon 20 times and then buy it of AH.
---
Didnt take me long to go with the Maraudon route
---
Hopefully not too many people read this but I dump all my excess thorium/dense stone into thorium shells/thorium headed arrows.  For whatever reason on my server shells go up to around 1.3gp a stack and arrows for 2gp a stack.  I told a guildie about it however and he dumped 80 stacks on the AH at one time and crashed the market.  Usually I just try to unload 20-25 stacks a day and maybe a bit more on Tuesdays.  
---
It may vary from server to server though so good luck.
---
because it still wouldn't stop the horde from killing you. Red is Dead.
---
Just make sure you dont join praxis the horde guild on alliance. Rollplayers are weird sometimes
---
https://i.redd.it/vv9k8omltb041.jpg
---
Not bis bro it's +21 not +21. Better go back
---
Then reroll to alliance instead of shitposting
---
Really, the bars must deceive me then.
---
74k empty R4 bar vs 58k empty bar.
---
Is that the same?
---
Fun fact: There are actually naming restrictions on RP realms.
---
Imagine actively arguing against your best interests.
---
Oh I'm not planning on staying in a bracket, just want to get to 60 as smooth as possible.
---
If all of those are on his account then that's a pickle. 
---
You could alternatively have an account that MUST have the same last name and get his toon transferred to your battlenet. But it must have their last name on it. It may be first and last. But I know it's at least last name.
---
That way he retains his battlenet to play his other games. While not creating multiple log-ins and flagging your that account for account sharing.
---
That is not the “only” thing that matters. It is the only thing that matters *right now*.
---
The data for 20-59 should be treated separately but it indicates how the 60 balance is going to develop.
---
Getting tanks and locks to synchronize their pulls can get sloppy real quick. The mage pull gives them a wider buffer. Alliance guilds use a paladin bubble to accomplish the same idea.
---
How is deleting WoW shortcut helping
---
Thanks, I'll also run to org/uc and see if I get the same issue.
---
its not about being good at 1v1s, its about running around by yourself when you dont have stealth.
---
Let me tell you a little story:   
---
I was 2h fury between raidnights in PvP with my trusted BRE and I was CRITTING 550 damage bloodthirsts... 
---
I crit 1.8k with Mortal Strike. Get yourself an Arcanite, OEB or Earthshaker and go to town.
---
By that logic 5 man dungeons is content for those who only fielded a 5 man roster. There will be pugs on mass for ZG and AQ20.
---
Hi, /u/Foghe

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e0gbl0/how_many_deathcharger_regins_have_droppe_across/). 
---
It won’t stop, it’ll just be a lot healthier. I’m looking forward to the wpvp once BGs are our.
---
How can you not cry when you crit 500-800 Bloodthirsts when you could also crit 1.3k wit Mortal Strike?
---
hmmm thanks for the reply
---
Per my original comment, your scope is too narrow-minded. That's what you don't take into account. Since you're not getting that I'll stop now. Obviously I'm not getting my point across.
---
Bst Hunter are top tier pvpers at those level ranges. And this Orc hunter resisted the Hammer of Justice stun which would have ended the fight otherwise.
---
I can relate to it so much 😭
---
If you want to play dps then maybe roll another class, druids are all about utility, they are the swiss knife of wow.
---
I don't think I've ever used a healthstone, I always forget about them the moment I hit accept.
---
Have a friend with dwarf priest named Grabbyhandz... so far so good
---
do you have a guide for this?
---
So, the 5x deposit thing, only happens at booty bay 100%. How weird.
---
your standings depend on your Honor points versus the rest of your faction on your server
---
it has nothing to do with the other faction or other realms
---
&gt;So, the 5x deposit thing, only happens at booty bay 100%. How weird.
---
Where in details does it show hand of justice procs etc? I've tried looking but couldn't find it.
---
Alright, I’m going to work right now so I’ll try to write as much as I can on the top of my head.
---
So pvp in fair fights (1vX small skirmishes) is tempo based. For example, if you get engaged in open world, the enemy has the tempo.
---
It is important to understand that concept because that’s how you do correct moves in a fight and you’ll reach a point where every global is correct.
---
So with mage, if you don’t have the tempo, you need to poly them and heal/get distance etc. if you bandage or evocate, resheep them because chances are it will break soon. Sometimes it breaks after resheeping as well, vanilla is too rng. So after you are ready, start with your strongest spell from a safe distance. If it’s not frostbolt, do a rank1 frostbolt afterwards.
---
Next, you need to know what other classes do, what cooldowns they have and how much time they take to recharge.
---
VS rogue for example, you start with fireball if they are sheeped (or nova’d), followed by a rank1 frostbolt. VS classes that have kicks (mage lock warrior rogue shaman) you need to fake cast in order to bait it. You fake cast by starting the cast and moving or having a macro so it stops. Warrior and rogue have melee kicks so it rarely happens that you have to fake them. 
---
Lastly, watch videos to see how the matchups go between the classes in general. There is a duel tournament going on so you may find good material. Also check Xaryu on youtube, great to learn mage pvp.
---
Glhf
---
Theres much easier spell to test it with. Pickpocket versus mobs.
---
It requires standing still, so no leeway.
---
You pickpocket instantly and move away. You get actual loot after delay, but spell goes off instantly. There is no delay or anything, if it went off on your screen, you are getting loot.
---
If you’re horde, you’re going to struggle to get into a decent raid team as resto Druid. Horde stack shamans and they only need 1 Druid in the raid for MoTW. Feral is the best way to get that because the damage is acceptable but they also give the crit buff to melee which horde also tend to stack because of windfury. Feral can also emergency tank.
---
Tanks and healers. Our DPS is already bursting numbers i didn't even have in Naxx 13 years ago. So much in fact that we too had to make use of a FuryProt maintank for more threat. But healers go oom really fast and MC gear isn't helping. Get's a lot better with T2 gear.
---
ok boomer
---
Spy never told you there was a stealthed player if the stealthed player was stealthed prior to entering spy range.
---
Ahh too bad! I wish it was, but all of this happened on Lucifron EU(DE). 
---
But I‘m glad you had a similar experience!
---
Lol if you knew anything about this game you’d know that a time sink has nothing to do with getting this. Stay mad though.
---
That’s what they are? I thought they were relics from the black empire, seeing they got qiraji art on them.
---
“Get off my ass rhino!”
---
Without dedicated graphics it might be kinda limiting.  You can always get a blizzard account and start up wow retail and see how it runs.  Classic will run a little bit better than that.
---
I just finished paying for my epic mount by farming the drops from the blasted lands mobs and sticking them on the AH. I got to play at pretty quiet hours due to my time zone difference which helped. But that’s pretty much all I did, and it wasn’t so bad
---
Guess who doesn't give a shit?
---
Everyone on this reddit.
---
That might be why i think they bring nothing to raid, just maybe. Holy shit you're a clown.
---
what an unbelievable tool... well, it is believable but still
---
&gt;25% stun resist!
---
is the best racial ingame right now
---
Because linking by IP address just over complicates the system and is even more limited. Your family couldn't play because you dungeoned, the internet cafe would only have 5 dungeons for everyone ? The dorm only has 5 dungeons for every student ? No it's a bad solution. Idk why you're complaining about this so much it's pretty much always been like this and prevents abusive farming of dungeons.
---
Except it does let you target people via the list it gives and you can set a raid marker on them which then makes them show up through walls if they are within 50 yards or so.
---
So yes, spy does allow you to see people through walls where you wouldn’t otherwise be able to.
---
A guild that works co-operatively will be stronger than a guild of strangers who think of every man for him/herself.  When half your guild is done with loot from MC do you just stop or struggle through with 20 or less people because your tanks still need bindings or some people need key items?  I don't need anything from Onyxia anymore but I still tank it for my guild because I know as a guild getting deathbringers/viskaggs/whatever will help us with BWL and beyond.
---
The command /targetprevioustarget or something like that will cycles between the last two targets. I use it a LOT now that I am used to it
---
What's the anti stealth?
---
Is this actually possible?
---
Man, you're not very smart, are you ?
---
thats awesome man, may the winning streak continue to your desired rank
---
&gt;  in terms of what blizzard considers bannable and what they don't.
---
took me way too long to find someone who understands the problematic. it is bannable, but they choose not to as long as multiboxer follow their guidelines.
---
 for example they dont want people to multibox in battlegrounds anymore and have send out warnings for it.
---
multiboxing to grind a herb spawn is exploiting the lootrules btw, but they are pretty lenient towards them despite the heavy effects on the economy.
---
Damn it! My name is Nerflegolas.
---
It wont stop and it should not, but people who does it for honor will do BG's.
---
Hmm If they want to pay a tank they can search in LFG that’s why they ask you. If you want to make Gold you can offer your tank soul in LFG. It’s that easy. I can understand both sides. But if your Main Goal atm is to farm gold then go for it. If they don’t offer you support as you support them... then you are busy I guess locking orbs? Ez :D
---
Yep, and once AV comes out shut yourself in from friday to sunday and farm exalted in one weekend. That's totally doable.
---
Exact opposite on Incendius.
---
just they no i'm gonna farm money and then gtfo to money farming. Might not be the most polite move to build a community, but farming gold for hours alone is nothing to be ashamed of.
---
I personally don’t charge them, but I also just say no. I was full BiS gear like 3 weeks into classic and ground all my items out without relying on guildies. I get new gear that is released within days of it dropping.
---
Part of your trial in a guild is grinding out your BiS, it’s no one’s responsibility but your own. How fast you do it is indicative of your ingenuity and dedication. The best players I know typically get their gear as fast as I do. 
---
If you need money because you need it for LHH, that’s a major priority, and they’re hurting the guild by not letting you complete it.
---
Well, I am right. Spells land after delay, true, but they don't fail to land. In fact specifically due to batching it is even possible for them to land on someone out of range.
---
A few tips for one shorting Ragnaros:
---
1. Have everyone bring Greater Fire Protection Potions. Seriously. If everyone uses 1 you stop 100k raid damage. 
---
2. Allow healers to get  the spots that allow their backs against the wall. This fight is hardest for them. Missing heals will wipe the raid, and not beating submerge isn’t a big deal.
---
3. Ranged DPS should be stacked in pairs of 2. They need to be 8yds apart to not add more people getting hit by Ragnaros’ ability that hits those with mana bars.
---
4. Ret Paladins/Enhancement shamans need their own place, usually between the melee dps and the tanks. They need to follow both the melee moving in and out, and pair of 2 in 8yds mechanics.
---
So the spy addon has ruined the game in even more ways now. Great.
---
Got it at 40 too.
---
Well yes you are.. there are 2 things to say about this really.
---
1. It is okay to just say no.
---
2. You are a tank, you gear all the raiding gear you could possibly need thrown right at you, which ONLY happens with the help of the 39 others. You dont have to tank every stupid thing that your guildies ask for, but IMO you have the responsibility to say yes to help guildies get gear upgrades sometimes. So either you do that to pay back or you simply say no.. Dont go around wanting gold and shit from guildmembers.
---
In a horde guild with ony and mc on farm. Next raid we're going to have 7 druids, and have never had less than 4
---
*smiles in pve server*
---
I, too, have dungeon loot 3 months after release :)
---
\&gt;aita
---
stop
---
Well no shit its less natural we have a timeline of when content is getting released and exactly what that content is. Ao progression is going to happen alot quicker.
---
Came here to say this as well, stole your answer so he can read it twice. Here's an updoot
---
I have it
---
Im using VanasKOS with the same basic tracking window functionality, purely by accident (just wanted to add notes to players), but after realizing just how overpowered it is I hate it but dont want to gimp myself by not using it.
---
Soulless ... that indeed is what the new website is. Glad I'm not the only person who thinks this. The old forums used to be very busy and awesome fun to go through, but now, they are a barren wasteland ....
---
But by giving not getting him anything, he goes out of the run with MINUS gold due to repair costs. Just being beat on lowers your durability.
---
They take advantage of him and lower the guild's overall standing by getting everything, both gold and loot while the tank is left out to dry.
---
I don’t necessarily agree with your second point. I play a Feral tank, and I’m the off tank to boot. There’s only three or drops from MC that are  actually good for us, and one of them is only for Fire Resist. Also, I came to the guild with my own Ony necklace from pugging, but that’s not something I directly put in my post.
---
I didn't understand a word.
---
Worst part is the majority aren't even getting honor because they dont wait long enough to kill someone. Ignorance is bliss I guess.
---
Won the savage gladiator chest at lvl 56 and was the only fury warrior when deathbringer dropped     from oynixia.
---
Aimed shot to face
---
LOL
---
My warrior as named Posternutbag, it got reported and had to change it.  Was just honoring my dead cat, don't see how it was offensive
---
git rekt
---
That's not how pre raid bis works
---
People who say reroll gfy. Give people the option to transfer to PvE.
---
While I get the repair bill being part of being a tank; it’s not like I’ll charge guildies for enchants I already have the mats for.
---
Opposite half the time on Ashbringer
---
That’s fair. Want to get some objective opinions from people who aren’t apart of this situation.
---
hey litle corey ofc
---
Whats your secret? I play Alliance on Arugal and never have we held BRM, never in my experience!
---
For now it's viable, but never top tier; then again, if any druid is top tier dps on your guild, you have other issues. A good player playing balance druid with great gear and consumables still won't do the dps of an average mage or fury warrior, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be if you look beyond the dps meter and value the utility of a hybrid.
---
Wat
---
You Can call blizzard and get the wow account moved to a different email? Nog sure if that woukd help. I "moved" my wow account from one email to another but all my d3 stuff is still on my other email. Now my wow and d3 are on separate accounts. Hopefully that helps you. Good luck!
---
It will not stop. But it will diminish to make it easier. Specially the skilled hunters that farm honor will use BG’s to farm it since it’s more effective. So you take away many of the best pvpers from world pvp for a good period of the day.
---
Good guilds aren't stopping to drink between trash pulls
---
I never said what I do doesn't work. I said your strategy doesn't work for every raid as it depends on more factors than "just be smack in the middle of threat in p1 and pop reck in p3".
---
Sweet. 
---
Not looking to top or anything just want to be able to tank outside raids without the respec to help out with the shortage.
---
I posted a video previously of a mob of level 1 hunters killing a world dragon, so the bar for "look at this awesome thing a hunter did" is pretty high for me at this point.
---
Wonder why people wouldn't want to 1v1 a fucking frost mage. Can't imagine why.

First question is why are 4 fire mages in a raid.
---
Wtf get your stuff by yourself like everyone else does and stop fucking leeching noob
---
alright man, I'm im insecure! Back to enjoying my pristine world PvP
---
This was patched but my impression was that it was patched for certain packs of mobs. For example it shouldn't work for a quest mob which has two "guards" with him, but should work if you accidentally aggro one too many mobs that have no connection to eachother whatsoever.
---
/use 13, /use 4 I think
---
Apparently there are only 4 PVP ranks as it stands. Will the whole 14 be in play as of next week?
---
something about 1 player controlling anymore than 1 character feels dirty
---
You dont need a tank for that

Dude, Vanilla content isn't hard.

Hmm, I'm a feral powershifting druid.

My dps is great on some bosses. Got awesome utility. And in instances im topping the trash meters aswell.

People just dont understand them and can only be convinced when they see a good feral dps druid.

 you would just /use the gear slot, I wanna say trinkets are 13 and 14, so /use 13 or /use 14.
---
They made it al the way to 60 before realising that?

Toxic thinking of modern gaming. If it's not 100% good then it's 100% bad.

That group over there is bad. It isn't my group. I'm good. My group is good. They're bad.

Why are they bad?

Oh, just because they're not my group. This is somehow mathematics?
---
You were able to make it to 30? When i first started playing i had 6 dudes all around 20 before i got a shaman up to 40 before deleting because i realized how truly awful pvp servers are.
---
Not viable etc etc. Look guys we all know they don't work as well as the standard classes. Even mages complain that locks are down damage meters and taking azure song mageblade, completely ignoring the curse that gives mages 10% more dmg, tongues on healing bosses, health stones summons survivability and actually their dps isn't poor. If we want to Min max let's just bring warriors and mages, for mc and fuck everyone else.
---
I play ele shaman I get really tired of people pointing out what we all know they are sub par dps. We all know that but I don't have a problem with that, you do. You likely have less than 5 offspecs in the raid that are still providing unique buffs, totems battlers and flex. I'm ele, half the healers die to some random shit, I know what I have to do.
---
I dont see the problem in gearing up in MC to do bwl, while bwl is out
---
It can be done, yes. When I was that level no one wanted me for their groups.
---
Nope
---
Tfinch on DD botted all the way to 60.  Reported by several people and now he's raiding in a guild.  It's so convincingly obvious he's never getting banned almost makes me consider paying 15 a month for a personal bot myself. 
---
But no, people say bans are in waves to make you feel better but they're not getting banned.
---
How is he a wigger suddenly
---
Wow forums are quite toxic. The official Blizz forums are straight up awful these days. There's a lot of repression going on
---
I had heard this about keeping their characters from beta. Is this true or just a rumor?
---
Dw isnt that great because you only have small windows to deal dmg. But try that, maybe works for you.
---
I think all ranks are out but rank 4 was the highest you could reach week 1.
---
1 is really overkill, the fight is positioning and a little bit of a DPS check, you don't need the pots if you fix those
---
Ele/resto Is a pvp spec, and in pvp you for sure want to use all mail pieces. Only exception is the BRD hit rating cloth belt.
---
Good thing we have a year before that's even an option. And you know, MC is so hard that we just can't afford to bring moonkin.
---
PvP ranks are like a ladder.  At the bottom it is easy to skip ranks (why some people got to rank 4 in the 1st week) but the higher ranks the slower it goes.  I think the estimation is that the quickest someone can get R14 is around 13ish weeks(don't quote me on this) when starting from rank 0.  So next week will most likely only have up to rank 6 (guess-timating).
---
I think the point was to not change things. 
---
There's a lot of quality of life improvements missing from Classic... because it's literally the first iteration of the game. 7 expansions worth of content, changes, and streamlining has gone into this game over 15 years. That game still exists. Classic isn't that game.
---
I'd like to hear other people's ratings on Tier set looks.
---
1. Druid. Every one feels really on brand and perfectly designed, and going up a tier is reflected looks wise.
---
2. Rogue. Very edgy and cool.
---
3. Shaman. Every one has a different flavor, the variety is great and they all feel powerful.
---
4. Paladin. T2 is legendary, others are good enough.
---
5. Warlock. Feels weird to put it in the middle of the pack because I really like these sets, could easily move up 1 or 2 spots depending on my mood.
---
6.  Priest. Not bad, just okay, but the flavor feels better than Mage.
---
7. Mage. Same, pretty meh and generic but not ugly by any means.
---
8. Warrior. Overdone, not a fan personally.
---
9. Hunter. All of them except tier 3 I guess look fucking terrible and do absolutely nothing for the class fantasy.
---
**Honorable mentions dungeon sets**
---
1. Shaman, fucking love this, wish I didn't pick Shaman as my main so I could justify using five thunders as my endgame. Even though Shaman t2 is probably the easiest tier set to get.
---
2. Rogue
---
3.  Druid
---
4.  Priest
---
5. Hunter
---
6. Warlock
---
7. Paladin (really don't like the shoulders)
---
8. Mage. Generic.
---
9. Warrior. Probably higher if Alliance.
---
Because in anything but MC and BWL they blast
---
Exiting bg's will always exit you to where your raid leader queued from. So yes a lot of the try hard corpse campers will have to fly back to there fav gys dungeon entrance spots
---
Dude. Yes. It’s a video game based literally on numbers. It’s allllll about mathematics.
---
I'm telling you, your characters have different seed IDs. The one who created the raid and is lead when entering the raid decides what loot seed will be.
---
English wasn't my strong suit, numbers were : )
---
Zandalar tribe (RP-PvP) or ashbringer (PvP) 
---
The rest seem to be horde realms.
---
I don't think you're an asshole. It sounds like they need your time, effort, and repair bills to farm something for their own benefits but are uncomfortable with you, as you help them, farming anything for your benefit. They may not even notice their own behavior and so I won't say that *they* are assholes but, in the cosmic justice sense, when someone does me a favor I'm always sure to try to tip them or offer some sort of recompense. 
---
Strat Live is the prime example. People need it for gear, reputation, or a shot at orbs and so they agree that the tank, who needs nothing there, gets the first righteous orb in exchange for the job he does for them.
---
Thank you for the reply. Regarding the 20 points in Holy, do you opt for +10% INT, then reduced knockback on heals? Is the improved seal of righteousness worth it at all? Seems like the extra holy dmg is good for threat but I’m not sure if it’s necessary. Being able to pop off a heal while being hit is pretty clutch too. 
---
And regarding the prot tree.. I should avoid being hit capped so I can still get hit with crits, yeah? I’m asking bc idk if reckoning can proc often enough while still being tanky. Soooo many issues to work out with a prot Paladin but I’m willing to make it work. I have a mage alt with herb/alchemy who’s gonna load him up with consumables, hopefully gonna make a dent in that mana consumption.
---
Fuckin a, man. As someone with a limited amount to play, how can you even play on that server? 111 min queue? That’s, more or less, all the time I have to play in one day.
---
RIP
---
Character IDs determine the cycle in the threat mechanic of Onyxia in phase 3. I wonder how true this is for the loot tables as well?
---
NTA- look man. I’m a newb but nothing in this world is free. I have a few buds who walk me through now and then. And I pay them, or offer at the very least. If they say no then fine but if they say yes backs are scratched. However often times they decline any payment. Have fun brother come to Blanchy if you need a change.

---
This is true, the sensation of  progression can often get mixed up with fun. But once you realize that you aren't really progressing to anything real, or false expectations, the sensation should die out.
---
I think a lot of people that play games nowadays, don't really do it for fun, but for that small shot at being revered and becoming a content creator. So you have that incentive.
---
Unless everyone had the add on, is it really a leaderboard?
---

---
Yup, that's us. It's Ruji making these videos. Aspire is the guild.
---
&gt; Surely the ganking i read about isnt that bad?
---

After 15 years I have almost finished leveling all of the alts I started...
---
Simple answer: Frost Nova to get distance and Frost Bolt to make sure they stay at a distance. 
---
Poly to reset fights so they are in your favour but sometimes it's best to just full on run.
---
Iceblock is great for breaking out of cc and try to make sure if you use it and the enemy has more cc (blind etc) you either have a restorative potion or you cold snap to Iceblock again.
---
Long Answer: Very complex to explain every single match up and encounter. Classic wow pvp is all about understanding what the enemy can do and what move you should do next. 
---
Sometimes you can play a fight perfectly in theory but RNG like resist or random price swings the fights out of your favour. There are also certain classes that straight up beat Frost Mage in a 1v1 or any kind of fair fight, in those situations you either run or have to play it with an advantage. Trinket and hard to farm consumables are also really difficult to account for and they all play a huge role in pvp. Best advice if you really wanna get good at pvp is either duel a lot of people or watch how Pro's like Venruki play. Sometimes it can be worthwhile to watch other classes too just to see how they are thinking into you.
---
What I wouldn't give for a raid-geared guild tank  who I could pay off...  
---
I don't think it's inappropriate to make requests for certain things as a condition for tanking runs, but I'd be a bit less ambitious about it.  For example, the mining at the end of DME.  I wouldn't try to reserve all of it, just reserve 1 node and then be allowed to roll on the others.  If you're doing the "I'll take all gear people don't need to disenchant" thing then you need to offer to enchant people's gear for free with the materials then.  Personally I don't like the disenchant arrangement because one of the fun parts of running dungeons (and maybe why you don't have your epic mount) is vendoring the gear that nobody needs as a result of a winning greed roll.   On my server large brilliant shards usually sell for less than the average vendor value of dungeon drops.

So the worse way to get honor? Have fun grinding 4 honor per kill in the aoe mess of ss
---
Missed the opportunity to add a brazzers logo somewhere in your picture.
---
Raids are super fucking easy no matter of the tank gets gear or not.. And thats not even the point. The point is tanks have it way easier with getting gear, so they dont have to do half the dungeons others do, so therefor its only fair that the tank helps the rest get some gear aswell..
---
In case you didnt know, dpers having gear kinda makes the raid easier aswell... Way easier than having a geared tank.
---
Oh, by all means, go for it! Im highly encouraging the experience. It is one of the few things in wow that actually make you want to take a break and breathe some fresh air.  It can actually get fun sometimes too.
---
Good guilds don’t even raid
---
What if they do rolls? People can roll on items they're allowed to.
---
There is a blue post that said they were going to follow closely to the original spacing. Can’t figure out how to link from this phone, but it’s an easy google. 
---
According to all the timeline predictions, that meant 160 days if you’re talking from classic day 1, longer if they would were going to go from vanilla day 1. 
---
They never released a date but theories and speculation based on the timeline put it sometime next spring. It’s pretty easy to see most articles and posts mentioning this as being at least 2020. Go find the posts that break down the numbers. It’s being released 47% earlier than expected. I’ll dig them up when I’m on my computer if you have trouble finding them.
---
or after deciding, people need roll and others greed?
---
I mean you actually ever stop doing mc - it just gets faster and faster to do.
---
Why should you be in a guild where you are 8th tank...? I also said it was okay to say no, you dont have to spend 6 hours a day doing it..
---
A Legend was made this day.
---
Let me just say this.... My level 50 warrior is currently, forever, stuck being murdered in badlands lol.
---
You’re still gonna wanna be killing rag the entire classic pretty much.
---
NAH
---
You shouldn't be obligated to go help someone especially for nothing in return. Your guildies arent assholes for expecting you to be a selfless team player (assuming they behave as such)
---
It's a difference of perspective. My current guild I 100% do stuff for free. We are a tight nit group of friends. I have every reason to help them out, as even from a pragmatic standpoint they help me as well
---
My previous guild I was much stingier. People were less helpful and more greedy, so I would help conditionally
---
D&amp;D would have been proud to write that script!
---
Question related to this - is +15 agility enchant for 1h from Timbermaw in the game currently, or no? I haven’t seen anyone with it but that could just be because nobody’s doing the rep grind...
---
Do you mean... leather daddy?
---
&gt;so they dont have to do half the dungeons others do
---
lol okay champ
---
I was okayish with expansions nullifying previous expansions - although I thought they kinda shoot themselves in the foot by basically defacto removing content from the game.  However this new retail thing of having patches invalidate precious patches in the same expansion is fucking dumb imo.
---
Me
---
I don't think that the consensus is that world PvP will go away when BG's are released, you're setting up  a strawman argument here.  When BG's are released, they will be a more dependable/structured/rewarding way of farming honor - so a significant number of the folks engaging in world PvP right now will be spending their time and attention in battlegrounds - rather than grieving people in the open world.  Will this mean that world PvP will "stop"?  Of course not - don't be stupid.  Will world PvP scale down a notch or two - yes it definitely will.
---
"valuable"? He still brings far less to the table than just having another mage would. A marginal DPS increase to 4 players is worth far less than having 1 more full DPS.
---
You don’t need mana tide once the raid is familiar with fights and stops screwing up. I respecced to 0/22/29 for improved totem buffs and slightly less mana/heal efficiency. I barely ever use any mana consumes now that we have stuff on farm and figured out but I was popping major mana pots and dark runes on CD previously.
---
So, use mana tide spec until your raid stops screwing up mechanics and once you guys are somewhat comfortable you can do a slightly different spec without it.
---
Chain heal, some fights like rag are mainly healing the tanks. Or fights like gate and major solo where you have multiple warriors tanking adds. Chain spam is decent but it’s not going to be super effective all of the time. You kind of need to use your best judgment. I will often spam healing waves on trash and certain bosses because it’s more likely to prevent deaths than chain heal.  
---
There are some MC packs near barons room that do a 2k dmg spell called fire blossom and if you try to chain heal the fire blossom those people are going to die to the other aoe from the other mobs.
---
That's where I am right now. I only play an hour or two a day so it's actually impossible to use up all the rest exp(lowest acc is high 20s)
---
How do you get this much zoom distance?
---
I wish it wasnt a thing, but I have to use it because everyone else do
---
All of it. He is literally in kargath all day and will wait for someone to afk, Rez, destroy them, then die to all the horde.

Where does this range stacking in pairs thing come from? I keep hearing it suggested. The damage isn't split on targets and there is plenty of room for everyone to range out properly.
---
You can try, but, I think it’s bound to the engineer who made it.
---
Or just check the price every day as you save up. The prices on my server atleast go up and down. So it might be smarter to stockpile gold till you see a significant drop then go all in

Its not easy for horde guilds either. 
---
I got told there isnt a spot for a feral dps by my guild in the main raid, they would only let me play feral in the main raid as an OT.  Meanwhile we have like 4 hunters, a bunch of rogues i was out dpsing and an enhance shaman with spots in the main raid.  I put shit loads of effort into consumes compared to a lot of people so hopefully I’ll be able to change their mind at some point.
---
For me is a twink a Character which I play next to my Main. Sorry that I didnt know it's now called "alt"
---
Yes players will get more honor from bgs and will also want rep from said bgs. They will wait in queue untill they're in one.
---
The addon really isn't that inaccurate, although the site it polls to tends to be. You just run it for about 10 minutes while it does a /who on every race / class / level combo, and then runs through every letter of the alphabet when there's more than 50 of any given combo (e.g. level 60 undead rogues, etc). 
---
After it's run through everything it says "I found X players on this server" and asks you to upload the data. You can then just switch to the opposite faction and do the same there which gives a very accurate snapshot of the horde / alliance ratio at that point. Problem is you can't do it on the server you play on because you can't create opposing faction characters, which is a bit of a pain!

It’s time.

Let’s talk TBC.
---
The listeners have been patient as the show took a break post-Blizzcon but is back with a vengeance as we finally break down a topic that many of you have waited almost two years to discuss – an in depth Burning Crusade chat and how it may go as a ‘Classic’ title.
---
Listen in on several die-hard Countdown fans, and TBC veterans, talk about their memories from the TBC days and how the community may approach the game if it were dropped as an expansion later down the track.
---
Also, hot on the heels of Phase 2 arriving 10 days ago, we talk a little about how that blood stained experience has been.
---
The episode also features the WoW Classic fan panel at Blizzcon that Josh was lucky enough to moderate, as well as Josh’s interesting re-telling of the 2019 Blizzcon experience.

This is the attitude of the typical 13 year old watching asmon
---
I can see the logic in it being like retail is as well. Raiding the equivalent of mc  all expansion every expansion mifht get tiring.

I’d look for this once BGs come out. No need to track rankings since max rank is 5 right now 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
You EU? Transfer to Ashbringer and I’ll give you a spot! I’ve a spot for a resto and you seem to have a great attitude!
---
But if you don't see them then why should a combat log give away your position? It's stupid, and immersion breaking. A 3rd party add on is giving you an extra hand.
---
I mean they shoudve known that actively picking a server together and announcing it was a very stupid move. They couldve easily not said where they were going, however this is more of blizzs fault because for some reason they thought ~10 servers was gonna be enough lmao so everyone wanted to make sure they were at least not on asmons server since it was a 1/10 chance.
---
Come to Bloodsail Buccaneers! It's great here. We've had quite a few PvP&gt;PvE rerollers joining the guild recently. Good times.

alt is an (alternate) second character, not considered your main.
---
twink is a lower level character that is decked out in higher level enchants and BiS gear that allows you to pvp at a much higher level. Twinks are usually lvl 19, 29, 39, and 49 because the idea is to play pvp battlegrounds with them. BGs are split by 10 levels (10-19, 20-29, etc) so at the levels I posted earlier, you will have the highest lvl character available at your current bracket with the best gear and enchants available. Unless you match with other twink characters, you will have a large advantage in the BG
---
Just started Classic yesterday after not playing WoW since Cata, a few basic questions:
---
• Does vendor price not appear on items when you just hover over them in your inventory?
---
• As a follow up, what are some good QoL addons for Classic, and how do I go about getting them? I don’t want anything game changing, just small things that will make leveling more enjoyable. 
---
• I’m a shaman and plan on leveling Enh. If I run dungeons as I level am I able to sufficiently heal, and are there certain talents I should pick up to do so?
---
• As another follow up, if I’m healing a low level dungeon (say like WC) whats the status quo on rolling for items that are an upgrade for Enh, but not healing? Just ask before or is that a no go always?
---
Thank you in advance. :)
---
I read this too - about the huge thorium requirement to max out engineering but it's not true.  I think I used a total of 100-125 thorium bars for leveling my engineering.  You use mithril all the way up to 260, when you can start making thorium widgets.  at 285 you can buy the plans for Thorium shells, and they stay orange all the way until 300 (2 thorium bars and 1 dense blasting powder).

I will not now or ever pay to heal some gimp with an over-inflated opinion of themselves through an instance.
---
That's pretty interesting and really a shame they didn't follow up on them. Some of the areas you mention are great but feel unfinished, and now I know why.
---
So, what's your donation quota? Or do you just like to anonymously shit on people over the internet and guilt trip them?
---
Because of the nature of the zone, it doesn't get used much. People run through the quest to get the trinket and never come back. I think they spent a lot of time on the area, and if they spent a little more people would actually use it over and over.
---
was going to ask
---
You're name is terrible and super cringe worthy, your attitude seems to be as well. Good luck in classic.
---
Oh man I would never delete at those levels aha
---
If you are rank 2 or above you can buy it from your PVP supplier. If you are esteemed and have rank 3 you get it for 20% off.
---
You're asking all the wrong questions
---
You can really feel it once you get into the 50 to 60 range, there are many zones that have a couple of quests and thats about it, Azshara, Blasted Lands, Felwood and winterspring...
---
Nope, there was a rogue ganking in winterspring at 4am. I've already started re-rolling horde. If I don't burn out first.
---
it goes both way lol, you're also getting help when you will have to farm 150 arena. I find it so alien to ask payment to help a guildmate. If you need money just do a group for a money making activity wtf.
---
Warstomp is great for PvP. Earth shock, stomp, earth shock for an easy 6 seconds of caster spell interruption  plus grounding totem on top of it makes caster lives hell if they are in range of you.
---
Its still like 720g I think
---
You had me at the first half, not gonna lie.
---
your reward is finishing your molten core about 3 seconds faster
---
Depends. I hate using playtime dedicated gold farming, and I get bored from it easily. With fishing I can watch YouTube/Netflix or get some work done while fishing and slowly, but consistently, getting the gold I need.
---
:^)
---
Alright. For me, every char next to my Main was a twink. Now i'm smarter ✌️
---
Wait until battlegrounds are released. BGs remove a lot of the ganking in the world.
---
these make my workdays go so much faster. SHAME YOU DROPPED ONE ON MY DAY OFF.
---
Haha love it :P
---
It's not so unexpected that the same people who wouldn't shy away from deliberately ruining others' leveling experience would not have developed much empathy or compassion for others with a different perspective ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
If you’re horde, you might have a better chance of leveling rn as horde population dwarfs the ally pop on most servers.
---
That’s something I’ve been wondering myself. I know druids will be the best FCs come BGs. But what spec do they go? Would it be 1/29/21 or my favourite healing spec 8/11/32. Would the 16% more stamina in bear form be with the healing from swiftmend?
---
That will change when battlegrounds are released.
---
wPvP will stop happening (on pvp servers) once people don't have to go into the world to farm honor.
---
 Funnel ToEPs and chokers into hybrids and wipe at 1% at later content bosses. ggez
---
Good guilds aren't.
---
Hell yaaaaa :D
---
private servers had no PVE servers where alliance could hide so it was roll on PVP or bust.
---
Definitely wish Blizzard went that route but eh, gotta appease the casual crowd
---
You can not place raid markers on enemy players in wpvp.
---
If an enhancer wants HoJ, he most certainly needs some kind of  tank.

Whats with all the pedos in wow?

&gt;If you aren't 60 by now it's your own fault.
---
My post-nerf Spy addon can pick up your hypocrisy from a mile away.
---
I think it is realm-dependent.  My realm feels like it has more warriors so you wont find a group looking for a warrior and offering orbs but occasionally there is a warrior spamming LFG LF heals/3DPS for live strat (1st orb to tank) or something similar.  I don't know how many start because honestly they usually need 3-4 people still and very rarely do I see them only needing a 1healer or 1dps.
---
I made the mistake of playing alliance for the first time ever
---
+8 All Res. Nice

OMG ive been waiting for this since October 29th after binge listening to this amazing podcast non stop.
---
I mean, the warr is the one who ran up, he can talk all the smack he wants.
---
The real accomplishment is managing bagspace
---
if it's patch 1.12/3 then it'll be the battlemasters in the cities.
---
Kind offer but I'll stick it out for now.
---
Depending if you play horde or alliance. When WSG will be released, it will become the fastest way to grind honor. But the problem is it will be released too early and BG will be cross realm. Also, keep in mind that Horde outnumbers alliance on most realms. Therefore horde pushing for higher ranks (11+) will be in an extremely weird spot: **they need to continue farm honor while in que for WSG.**
---
As a consequence, I think WPvP for horde will just evolve from large scale battles to small ganking death squads.
---
hi5
---
Hehe.
---
Alliance dominates usually because paladins&gt;shamans in premades.
---
Privates barely attracted those "cry about pvp all day" and in general had better players, so even some unbalances were solved because smaller groups were coordinated.
---
Our druid raids as hotw and he does just fine. Very viable spec for raising right now.
---
The basic mentality of the players and desire to min-max would still exist and result in a different experience than in Vanilla.
---
Indubitably
---
He's making it a big thing because it fits his point. Blizzard is a greedy company that ONLY wants to make money. It's almost as if they're a regular business which in the end always revolves around making a profit.
---
Blizzard already understood Classic would bring them money, but he just needs to show that he is *that* much more intelligent than the rest of us. He sees through Blizz intentions!
---
Yes.
---
The cutoff is by percentage.
---
There are twice as many spots for bracket 14 vs alliance if you have twice the population.
---
Just think about it.
---
And in which way does using flasks etc now helps with your preparation for later raids?
---
Hi everybody,
---
Currently a 51 Alliance hunter on firemaw, would it be better to stick to ZF grinding till 54-ish and then try to get groups for BRD etc or should I try another dungeon? If so what would you recommend?
---
No, you guys refuse to answer the question.
---
Percentage based cutoff = more spots per bracket.
---
Same server, 1.5x as many spots for Horde. Care to refute?
---
Ashbringer or razorgore if you want a decent realm that isn't super high pop. I wouldn't consider any other than those 2. I myself play on Gehennas and think it's worth the hassle though. More players=easier to find groups.
---
"very alliance sided" said no one ever
---
keep in mind that only 1 member of a party/raid is needed to que for a BG. 
---
We made some calculations in our guild (mainly PvP guild with the scope of doing some PvE) based on the realm population and the situation of PvP participation and we determined that we need 14 weeks of BG participation to rotate our entire guild rooster in rank ranks 11-13 and keep in check rank 14.
---
this
---
I don’t think you’re an asshole and I understand your situation but I expect my officers to volunteer a bit of their time to the guildies for free. 
---
That said, if your guildies are demanding tank assistance all day long, I don’t think it would unreasonable to explain their eating into your gold farming time and see what they offer you.
---
I'm providing a second estimate with a better sample size and methodology before asserting big things like he is.
---
as much as i dont really care for asmon hes frustrations seemingly mirror the general player bases now. people endlessly camp (grief) him so he cant actually play the game. which is basically the same shit the smaller population on any PVP server is facing
---
It depends entirely upon your speed and efficiency.  If you're able to do it 4 times in an hour (I've seen a video of it being accomplished in 9 minutes which is insanely fast) then you can make 100g+ per hour.  HOWEVER - I will tell you that just because you are a hunter does not mean that you're going to be able to stroll right up after getting some dungeon gear and put DM north tribute on farm.   It is difficult, and requires practice and finesse.  
---
I have attempted the DM north tribute run many times, and still have yet to complete it.  I'm not the best hunter to ever play the game, I'm just telling you that it takes a ton of practice before the gold starts rolling in.  I think this is one reason why the economy hasn't really been wrecked - because not nearly as many people are doing it as we all thought there would be.
---
People are greedy. I'm a level 58 warrior tank and I'd never reserve items or charge people. Just as they can't run the dungeon without me, I can't run it without them. No one gets geared without the help of others.
---
And yes, I've run dungeons that are "useless" to me. I ran Mara princess runs a bunch after I got my ring to help some people that grouped with me as I farmed.
---
You're straight up delusional if you think you're entitled to someone elses' time to run you through shit because you lacked the foresight to see what would happen when you made a dime a dozen class in an unneeded role while simultaneously having zero friends. 
---
Time to take care of yourself bucko, tanks don't owe you shit.
---
That's mind boggling indeed. Morgan's Vigil. An outpost against the black dragon flight and Iron Dwarfs.
---
"Should we hire guards?" 
---
"No, we will be fine!"
---
It's called a MAGEblade for a reason.
---
Good luck convincing a lock to raid with you when you prioritise mages like that
---
Was it elvui? What add on is this
---
Yeah man - Best way to best altoholism is just to *push through* on **one** character!
---
Seriously, pick one class and just go with it. If you get that tingle deep down that says "mmm maybe I want to play my &lt;blank&gt; instead" just bury that shit immediately.
---
It feels really good to have a toon doing higher level content so you have lots to look forward to!
---
After the first two weeks of launch, I was getting jumped more for sex because I was no longer hounding her.  WIN WIN all around.
---
Blade of kill always have the searing gorge entrance and the mc portal with the exception of horde raid nights
---
Gimme the math on a hybrid staying afloat in an 8minute C'thun fight.
---
Hey mate, thanks for the love and I definitely did catch that message. Sadly with only a couple of episodes left for Countdown I don’t think we’ll be able to get to that or a number of topics that I would have loved to have done :(
---
If he's a war he should use it. I think it hits pretty hard
---
So everyone should just pick horde?
---
PvP is just the only way to go if you want to enjoy leveling. The stuff you read on here is mostly from people on servers with huge faction imbalances.
---
I was lvl 51 when phase 2 hit and I still got lvl 60 by questing mainly. And there was always action somewhere to take a break from the grind. I highly recommend it!
---
DM and I’ll send you our rag positions. I have the ranged in pairs in positions where I know if they get hit with a fireball, it knocks them to a spot in the lava that they can get out from.
---

---
Which classes wear gear from mc in naxx?
---
Nothing wrong with an spriest man. In fact a good spriest can do rogue damage and keep healer mana constant, the downside is they probably have to drink every 2-3 pulls. But if you have 55 mage water thats only 15 seconds of waiting.
---
I have two paladins. One at 33 one at 34. Just kill me already.
---
Oh no you can't do that, button actions can't be re-assigned in combat.
---
Thanks for that!
---
Holy fucking CoC resists... Had to be at least 4 in that fight. So much missed shatter damage
---
Well since he has the upper hand with the initiation, 7 more levels and and I am on 80% hp and 50% mana. I'd say resisting a stun would make it pretty even
---
I feel you. Currently trying to stick with my Druid so I can keep up to my friend... but my heart says roll hunter/mage/warrior alts
---
"I think you're a fucking asshole actually"
---

---
StReAMeR bAD
---
8th tank... Maybe you should be the 4th DPs warrior
---
Don’t sleep on earthshaker either that thing is broken
---
1 frost *spell power* and 9 int are completely negligible in raids. All the fights last 1 minute and you should be ending at like 50% mana or more.
---

---
Im the same Guy basically, 
---
What I found to work for me is to have a really good thought on what I want from my wow expérience, then I plan ahead exactly the leveling process and finally apply it thoroughly. 
---
It helps my lunatic mind to focus more on my long term goals rather than the everyday gameplay where I just wonder how easy it would have Bean to Cruise through on a warlock and oh WTH YOLO LETS MAKE A ALLPOWERFUL WARLOCK
---
Phase 3
---
Fuck off dude, nobody wants castbars removed and if they do they are fucking terrible at the game already and should not have any influence at all in those decisions being made.
---
I dont know how are others guild from inside, but the one I have now in classic is the best I ever got the chance to be part. 
---
First is not a big hard min/max guild, everyone try to help each other and almost at every time they do it free: No crafting bid, arcanite transmutes free, blue BoE free for anyone who need them, and they all do it because they want to help you and dont wait for anything in return.
---
But all of this makes you want to contribuite too for the guild and you too offer your services free or at special prices for them.
---
Im at 60 warrior and i run dungeons with them, I dont ever care about the loots, im having fun with them  and thats all the  payment I recive. This game its great, man,...
---
Herbs are pretty average. Lots of shitty sun grass mixed in with dreamfoil. Ores are average. Satyrs are an ok grind but at most 30gph and that’s with no competition and decent felcloth RNG. What am I missing here?
---
You can even simply use the ability to cancel it like normal, don't need a macro or anything.
---
You're basically equating pvp and being raped by 100 horde from Thorium Point to BRD
---
If you think pvp means this moronic experience, you have brain issues
---
Not happening.
---
I love how every butthurt idiot comes in here theorizing about how to ban or change Spy without knowing jack shit about the WoW API and LUA scripting.
---
It's not going anywhere.
---
There is a neutral flight path in the EPL, but its not conquered by a faction.
---
Controlling the 3 Towers gives a Zone-wide buff (also inside naxx/strat) - and i am 99% sure not a flightpath, cause i played it 15 years ago.
---
Fishing for Essence of Water
---
Lots of guilds have one main tank who gets everything first, then secondary tank and third tank and so on. I assume in this case there was a discussion about who should be MT and op volonteered to stand back and let others get that position.
---
Fuck off and go play hello kitty island adventure.
---
Do it like Diablo 2 or PoE. You just start new servers on a fix schedule. Then you let the servers just progress 60-70-80 to work. Then you kill them (or merge to some "end standard" server). 
---
This way, if you like classic you can just play the start every 3rd month. If you like to play lots, you play on different servers on different characters that are in different phases. If you play little and just want to tag along, you stick to one. Then the servers follow the original expansion and phasing theme, maybe modify this schedule over time to improve the experience.
---
In this way blizzard can keep players interested on the game that they developed by running it round and round. Earning money. And we get to play the game that we love.
---
And don't bullshit me with (ohh I will lose all my stuff after 2 years), yes, exactly. Look at leagues in PoE or Diablo, players there do not care what happens when the life cycle of a league ends.
---
A lot of pre bis IS raid bis.
---
NTA.  Tanking sucks.  You have to lead the group.  Most are brain dead.  I wouldn’t make a big deal of it but Id look to stop doing favors for selfish people.  The best case scenario is everyone should have something to gain from a instance.
---
I wish these no addon scrubs would fuck off. You're literally a noob if you use no addons, sorry.
---
"Most raid leaders"... You are massively underestimating the amount of casual raiding guilds. Some people even play non-dwarf priests if you can believe such a thing.
---
And your 3rd eye.
---
The total Horde population across all servers nearly doubles Alliance. No matter how you puzzle cross-realms together you can’t solve that equation.
---
I would like to see mage vs oomking dps on a short fight if oomkin uses a flask.
---
Mara and ST
---
Good thing we aren't playing an FPS then!
---
This is what horde are actually trying to validate by saying bullshit like "reroll pve". Blizz you seriously fucked up.
---
theres also a ramp in the middle north that allows access from nagas to kimjael almost directly in a line
---
“Just organize and get better at the game.” Super ignorant statement.
---
First: the original game was not like this. I played on Magtheridon starting about 3 weeks after vanilla launch.
---
Second: Most of us have jobs and lives, so getting corpse camped by people who don’t have anything better to do sucks. It wastes our very limited play time. I’m not gonna continue wasting my time. It’s just not fun.
---
I’ve raided mythic in every expansion and I’ve had 2k rbg and 2/3s arena ratings in multiple seasons.
---
PVE servers aren’t a mistake, they’re just fine. All my friends chose a PVP server, so I was playing on there with them. I could get every last one of my friends, and all the randos who joined our guild, together in a raid group and try to fight horde but it wpuldn’t even be close enough to handle most of these raiding parties I’ve seen. 
---
Plus the horde always call in more and more people any time someone starts fighting. Can’t even get a fair 1v1 without 10 more horde showing up to kill everyone in the area.
---
They let them keep them but made it impossible to feed them(cruel and unusual imo). So hunter just keeped them stabled if they didn’t want to lose them. Pets will run away if not kept happy. When bgs came out there was a solution. In battle grounds when the hunter is rezzed the pet is too and the pet get a happiness/feed effect at the same time(quality of life buff so the hunter doesn’t have to feed the pet in the middle of battle). This was the only way to keep the pet in a vanilla as far as I remember.
---
I disagree but ok. I mean they can release new servers for you boys. Like 1-2 that indefinetly wanna re experince classic lol
---
&gt; If you don't like PvP, you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server.
---
"You rolled on a PvP server. That means you have to like EVERY SINGLE WAY this can turn out. If you don't then you're a dirty no good care bear and deserve it all like the fucking casual you are." ~ /u/NostalgiaSchmaltz 2019
---
Spy should be banned.
---
Player draw distance should be increased and spy removed and I'll be happy.
---
Til then though it's spy and basically a 20 yard draw disrance
---
I should have specified, but I imagined this being while leveling, when most aren't powershifting yet.
---
They make you change it once, if you rename back to the same name then you get 24 hour suspension. I know because my friend did this - name: vulvasaur
---
Doesnt matter since this is not a level 60 fight. 6 sec CC = win or lose
---
Yeah, it's called looking at your minimap with track humanoids on.
---
Are you a fucking mongoloid or something?
---
OP, I agree with you 100%. 
---
First of all, I couldn’t imagine asking a tank in my guild to run something he didn’t need. If he insisted on helping I’d give him gold or all the non-need rolls. This is exactly how I did it with a friend for helping me and my gf 3man arena for her Savage Glad.
---
Anything less is greedy and I’d feel ashamed and embarrassed.
---
I have heard that it is not yet, but I have absolutely no source to back that up
---
Love you fam but rolling the dice is so stacked against you, and no offense but completely stupid. No high item price actually sells for the value of its rarity.
---
A very extreme take on this would be something like Freezing Band. If it actually sold for its rarity cost, it’d be “worth” 5 digits++. Much more efficient to Farm the gold in just about every case.
---
I mean that’s great and all but we all know gnomes are the best warlocks.
---
isnt this the wow vanilla experience?
---
Great guide, OP. Thank you :)
---
Why all the down vote? He is right. This is nowhere even close to being a fun game, and it's got nothing to do with player skill. 
---
This is how you horde reply to everything.
---
PvE servers are the best thing and the only reason i would even consider playing. Not everyone likes to gank or even pvp at all. I miss out on exactly nothing i like to do.
---
I don't see how it's much different. I was running princess for people when it gave me no experience or loot. There's always something else you could be doing that's more important to you, if you're not the type to help people when you can.
---
Oh that's really cool.
---
Yep I have a giggle every time I land at LHC and 15 horde camping it, kill me upon landing for 0 honor then I rez and run off without dying again
---
Be careful with that aswell, they like to be in IF aswell!
---
Ty for tip
---
Horde symbol on pc confirmed
---
Private servers were fairly balanced due to there not being that many pve servers, pvp players like horde pve players like ally, sorts itself out quite well. But yes population differences always grew over time.
---
And pvp servers are pure cancer when the balance goes to shit. Pure. Fucking. Cancer.
---
Red is dead
---
Imagine having to "optimize" your life for a fucking video game and calling it a non-issue LOL
---
Some more information would be helpful. Which class are you, and which fear ability does the trinket not work with?
---
Yes. So the bar is lower. More people are getting R8 gear on the dominant faction than the outnumbered faction.
---
Exactly as you say, it's increasing the inequality PER SERVER.
---
Lol, no.
---
What you're asking for isn't demanding a lot. 
---
Sounds like they're just bring choosey beggars.
---
Ah, the place where all the Hunter Bots with Chinese pet names are hiding in p2. Free honor down there boys!
---
I know the 21st person which had 130k here (Rogue).
---
Well private servers had BG's from the very start, so usually pvp wouldn't be that crazy.
---
In our guild, tank get all the +def, the tier, shield of course and the 2 handers for their pvp specs. Fury, like rogues are getting things like Accuria first, or even Onslaught Girdle. Can't blame them I find hit elsewhere, human perks.
---
There is always pve servers yaknow! ;);););)
---
You know it
---
Horde will most likely still roam searing gorge, burning steppes and felwood while waiting in queue.
---
You can report them if they're targeting you that much.
---
If you need 30 bandages an hour, you grind the wrong mobs. Also, the time spent eating is time where you could already be fighting again making this gold back. It is also a time window where you are open to ganks.
---
I Will be honest with you: enh Shaman is boring af to level up. Elemental is fun and explosive past level 40 but you need to drink a lot.
---
Thays why im in orgrimmar ganking them at their portal spawn.
---
Yeah I didn't learn it until my friend mentioned it in early October. There are only 6 nodes, all of which are in Azshara, they have about a 2 hour respawn timer from what I've heard (haven't stayed around long enough to confirm), and they require at least 415 fishing (I think, might be 420). You're also not guaranteed to get an essence from a node, you can get Elemental Water or Globe of Water from them as well, or you can get several essences (my record is 2).
---
Why would you not pick the best option for a class I’m confused, dwarf is best when it comes to priest that is a given.
---
Imagine poopsocking a 15 year old video game
---
Exactly. Some people are bad team players and shouldn't be in a guild
---
Idk man, a shaman could probably tank those runs with a good shield.
---
They are all related... they all wanted me to pay their jacked up raid night prices on the AH instead of using the trade channel for what it’s for.
---
&gt; Orc racial doesn't matter much in PvP
---
Sounds like you need to see IMMUNE on your Bash as much as I've seen it on HoJ before coming to this very stark conclusion
---
Our only feral is a tank :P
---
Yeah we're far from minmaxxing, what with having a boomkin and both dps varieties of shaman
---
Need a quest done in a dungeon? Sure I'll come help you out (mind you I'm not a tank, but the mindset still applies). Wanna farm 200 runs of the dungeon, with no real incentive for me? No thanks.
---
Surely they are as hotly contested as black lotus then? If you can get 4-6 essence an hour that’s one of the most profitable farms in the game.

Yes i've done wpvp and there is alliance groups roaming alot also, so it's not just one sided atleast not in brm and plaguelands. Theramore is always horde occupied tho. And 2-3 undead rogues always camping ironforge. But pretty balanced overall i think.
---
Nah, &lt;ANUSTART&gt;

imagine making reddit threads about extraordinarily mundane "feats" in a 15 year old video game.

---
You could also make both factions on a PvP server on most Pservers
---
I feel you man, this shit happens all the time on Flamelash EU. I am lvl 56 warlock, a warrior in t2 helm/t1 shoulders/quel'serrar attacks me and gets his ass handed to him just to get his also raid geared mage and spriest to back him up and camp me 3v1 endlessly. How is that even remotely fun for anyone is beyond me at this point...might as well leave for some time until this all blows down.
---
Did someone say pvp happened
---
Pretty sure this is the consequence of try to creating a world as compact and efficient as possible. No space can be "useless" - so the density of stuff you just have to avoid or walkthrough to get from A to B is huge. And because we ourselves, with our mounts and all, are so fast we also clash with all this things faster, making the world feels more artificial and much more unorganic to navigate through.
---
One part of me wishes that Blizzard would give the world some more filler space, some lawn or sea just for the purpouse of a bigger world with some breathing space, instead of the fully-packed continents we have today. As a Horde i esp. miss zones with simpler design - something like Elywinn and parts of Kul Tiras, a simple wood with blue sky.
---
yeah but i clicked off stealth right away so it doesnt count hehe :)
---
Some of my most vivid and enjoyable memories were of people failing airburst in CoT - Hyjal, the outburst of people giggling and cheering were the most fun of times. (course this loses novelty after x wipes but dang).
---
At you 53 you can spam BRD till 58 and then get into Strat/Scholo/BRS till 60.
---
Helping guildies is a whole different animal in terms of payment, especially, and reserved items to a lesser extent.  Assuming your guild isnt full of assholes, by helping them get better, you're helping yourself.  Your loot and trash drops from a run will cover repairs (assuming you don't wipe repeatedly), so asking for payment in a guild run seems kind of dickish.  Reserving stuff you need is reasonable, we avoid it by trying to not run people they need the same drops in the same groups.
---
Seething OP
---
Playing wow is about fun so it doesn’t matter if you do something stupid
---
Wtf does tank/dad wme means?
---
No wonder they are confused
---
Only in boss fights with fear mechanic; otherwise 5% spirit is better
---
It will be much better yes. Much much better.
---
Hi there! How many bank twinks would I need if I wanted to take herbalism/mining until 60, keep the mats and then respec into alchemy and mining? Is that even really feasible? I’m not very far into the game, so I’d mostly have 6-slot bags at my disposal.
---
I checked my server on launch, there was at least 3 Legolas's.

I don't have a HoJ so I don't know. Clicking on the name of the player should bring up a detailed list of everything they did though and item procs should be listed.
---
Also doesn't HoJ say right on the item itself it has a 2% proc chance?  I guess it's also possible that HoJ is one thing not listed and your contribution to the discussion is passive aggressively pointing that out.
---
[why yes I do main horde on a horde dominated pvp server, how could you tell?](https://imgur.com/a/5L7MPeb)
---
You're just whiny
---
If you played vanilla,  a pve server would probably be a boring carbon copy. I choose pvp for the extra layer that fights an early burn out.
---
I've always been a severe alt aholic. Back in BC when I played the most by the time WotLK came out I had 4 level 70s (mage, rogue, hunter, druid), a level 50 something pally, a level 40 something warlock, and some other toons around level 30 or so. I'm sure other people had more, but not bad for a 14 year old. I think I'm doing a little better at focusing on my main now, I'm up to level 51, I've got 3 alts but the highest level one is only 16 right now.
---
#nochanges
---
F1-4 depending on keyboard is really good as well. Prob not with alt-modifier tho :p
---
Wait, you're complaining about PvP happened on a pvp server?
---
53 is too low for BRD
---
Bro just stop being lazy. Duh
---
yep unfortunately that's the 3rd guild I tank for, and all have been a different flavor of the same bullshit.
---
All my irl wow-playing friends have quit the game that's why I end up not having my own guild I was supposed to be MT for anymore, and looking for a spot elsewhere has only been trouble so far.
---
I unsubbed today, I think this game is not for me, once at raiding level, because it's really too difficult to find a good group of friends to fairly raid together. I don't want to have to deal with this kind of bullshit and unfortunately I think this happens because of the way the reward system is designed.
---
If you can reliably solo farm Devilsaurs, you can get about 50g an hour given no/low competition. That's extremely server dependant though.
---
For real. Is this the new drinking game?
---
You can only queue at the capital cities, Hillsbrad, and Horde the Barrens and Ally in Ashenvale.   That would be a lot of travel for some random PVP.  
---
i.e.  BGs will change everything due to the amount of honor that can be scored up there.
---
It is really simple, if I see guildies helping others out, I will help them out. If I see someone only doing things for themselves then I am not wasting my time.
---
A good example is from leveling I ran Mara princess and unhealthy amount of times two guildies got three ring ahead of me in rolls, my wife healer had everything, make from guild had everything. Guess who stuck it out until I still didn't get my ring and said fuck it wife can get it for me at 60? It wasn't people I ran a few dozen princess runs for then each bailed the second they got it and didn't help me finish getting mine.
---
Later 50s guess who is asking for me to tank stuff for instances they need? Nope sorry I need the same loot and I know exactly what they will do if they win the roll ahead of me. On the flip side I have happily gone out of my way for the mage (and the wife obviously).
---
I ran jailbreak, attunement, and UBRS with lowbies so many times for attunements. Who was there to refuse to help when we needed dps? There two that got their rings and ran.
---
Many people make the argument it is for the guild. It fucking isn't with people like that. I am sure no one is surprised that one of them soon left the guild for better pastures when the condition for fury warriors bidding on core hound tooth was set to having the BOE gloves I forget the name of that give dagger/sword/axe skill. We have similar requirements for the leaf and eye, priests and hunters that want it and have the other required items get priority. You want a hand off rag? Be the furthest in getting the non-raid required items.
---
The other hasn't been on in weeks.
---
Helping guildies go both ways. If people are helping the guild I help them. If people are not, I quite frankly don't consider them part of the guild. If you want help participate in the guild like you actually care about the people on the other side of the screen and they are not just a tool to further what you perceive as a personal achievement.
---
Explains why I've never missed a cast there.
---
I do! Just let me get out my felhunter first...

As I mentioned above, I very explicitly explained why we need to focus the adds - to avoid the healing mechanic. I understand the logic behind why the healer was so insistent on wanting the DPS to tunnel the boss - the fight was taking longer than the healer had mana for the tank - but I told him that was flawed because then we’d never get the boss below 90 percent health. 
---
And when there was a disease on the tank, I sometimes said “why aren’t you dispelling?” but I also explicitly said “the tank has two diseases on him now, we’re out of combat, you have full mana, please cleanse the tank”;
---
Maybe the people who play WoW are the type of people who *do* care that they keep their loot indefinitely...?
---
Why not just have us lose all our gear when we die too? And don't bullshit me with ohh, people play EVE and hardcore mode and they don't care.
---
Yes, you are right
---
Hi from atiesh!
---
Get all the quests for sunken temple do it once or twice because it takes so long. Get quest for brd and start the grind.
---
Yeah the dungeon has great loot for every class and spec too
---
Who wastes their time reporting these names..? I can see if it was like BloodyPussLuvr or something obscene but Vulvasaur is harmless and at least a little clever.
---
Benefits of an unfinished zone: bunch of random shit.
---

---
What? If you have been waiting 4 days to find a group to do a dungeon with, then why are u even considering staying on that server
---
you guys should stop trying to name costs as if youre trying to sound like a reasonable adult. at least wait until BGs are out for a bit and theyll have honor leaderboards probably 1-4 months afterwards.
---
I think every guild member should be prepared to essentially donate time and effort for the benefit of other guildies. It sounds like you're already doing that and they're asking you for more.  
---
  
---
We all have individual goals alongside our common guild goals. In an effort for them to achieve their individual goals they're asking you to essentially neglect your own goals. You're not an asshole assuming your side of the story is even remotely close to what's going on.
---
Deserved for being a horde biatch
---
Ive rolled ally there
---
It's the same as usual, If they're gonna kill a lvl 34 now they would kill a lvl 34 a month ago.
---
(I would know, Im one of the people killing 34s)
---
Well they are volunteering some time by helping with attunements. No one did that for me. And offering services on demand for dungeons that don't make that much gold is actually pretty nice already. More than that would be appreciated, but not expected.
---
Bad bot... oh wait, it's not a bot!
---
TBC started in 2007 in January.
---
Jack uad enough room. Bro was just an emo kid in the movie.
---
I just went from shadow back into holy nova and had to buy it again so I’m surprised that’s your experience.
---
No doubt, just saying it's hard to gauge faction balances.
---
I'm a rogue and I was specifically trying to find hoj procs and sword spec procs in details several times. I don't know if it's the only thing or if I'm just not looking in the right place. No passive aggressiveness at all. I think details just lists it as auto attacks, but I wanted to see how often it proc'd on certain fights/parses in MC. I was also hoping to see if those two things ever proc off of eviscerate.
---
Locks scale better than mages, as the content continues warlock dps in raids will match and even surpass mages once you are at the very endgame of gear, except for the one mage getting all the rolling ignites ofc. As locks get more spell hit, the gap closes.
---
where is the extra crit for healing in ele?
---
If you are even considering this is PvP you are mad. 
---
PvP with Gps addon. 
---
PvP with 5 to 1 pop difference.
---
 
---
Use your brains.
---
Exactly! Exactly what this guy is saying.
---
Maybe you’re just too soft for a PvP server? 😂
---
Well it's only USD $50 for a year. According to Google that is around 100 Belize dollars though. :)
---
I mean, you saw the druid for a second there and you didn't do anything
---
Ah okay so does that mean misuhdare circlet of the MINDFLAYER is a shadow priest item? And is staff of the shadow flame for warlocks? 
---
Ill happily pass on mageblade to get shadow flame later on.
---
supercasuals can go die anyway
---
If they're controlling the top spots for Honor each week, the guild can effectively calculate it ahead of time.
---
I don't think it's wrong for you to ask for compensation, but you also shouldn't get upset if people get offended by it. If they don't want to compensate you, you can simply say "no".
---
Sparebar, mouse wheel press/ scroll, and mouse buttons with modifiers are also good ones
---
I've used shift + space for taunt on my tanks for as long as I can remember.  Use that massive key to prevent missing if you have big hamfists like me.
---
It's hard to say for sure as it could just be confirmation bias, but i feel like weapon skill actually makes a pretty noticeable difference even at the lower levels for meleers. Thus far on my dwarf melee it feels like I can miss a ton if I try to fight anything yellow and not green, but on my human the hit appears much more generous, perhaps with me also just doing more damage in general even with white attacks. I used to be kind of indifferent to human racials other than diplomacy and I *thought* weapon skill was only good for raids but I think that's not quite true.
---
That's not a gank. He just attacked you.
---
Because it's a game
---
We have very different vision of what PvP means then.
---
No you are no asshole, but maybe explain your situation to your guild members. If they understand then it's all good and if not then just stop tanking for them.
---
I personally started playing an alt to pvp and farm gold, because I was in your situation...
---
You only need 1 for shadow weaving, two just means more wasted debuff slots, and a lot less damage than another dps class.
---
That's entirely incorrect. A healer can waltz in at 51, you can throw down easily as dps at 53. Not the Lyceum or emp, but everything up to Flameboi, basically. Or just anger runs.
---
Players fighting other players?
---
Youre objectively incorrect.
---
There is nothing 2 shadow priests bring to raid. 1 is needed to add 15%damage buff to warlocks
---
You can spam the beginning. You won’t be able to run the whole thing.
---
Personally I found it the easiest to level in zones that are a few levels below me. So at 42.. badlands and southern stv
---
Yeah, seriously, wtf is Jolleeeeek on about?
---
I actually prefer to be on the lower population faction. I have more encounters, which means more wpvp,  which means more honour for me.  Also my que times for battle grounds will be less. I much prefer it!
---
&gt;This is what PvP servers are - and have always been.
---
I disagree, WPvP pre p2 wasn't necessarily fair, but it was manageable.
---
People are just honor hungry atm, they rather get less honor in a 10 man than no honor in a 1 man group
---
In your opinions, if you love PVP but don't have time to dedicate to end-game raiding, are twink BGs a better option than getting to 60?  
---
Seems like you'd be on a more level playing field since you wouldn't be competing against people with raid gear, but also it would be kind of shallow since I don't think you can rank up as high if you're not max level.
---
You did great job ,and that pala was pretty bad :D Outplayed him hard
---
Whenever I see this image it reminds me to stop sitting like that and take my knife off my test
---
Can you please elaborate on what wasted debuff slots means?
---
Well said mate!. #nochanges #gotoretail
---
I’m glad I xferred off. I went to Heartseeker 3 days after it opened, mostly to avoid the que since I had to go back to work, but the horde didn’t help the decision either 
---
I know heartseeker alliance are often seen as the runways or whatever but I’m glad I ended up on the alliance dominated server and doesn’t take 20 minutes to get to BRD
---
We just pay for a lock summon to DM
---
The Horde being the best place ever. We're a bunch of freaks and outcasts struggling for a normal, peaceful existence in a world that wants us dead
---
Congrats!
---
They exist.
---
Lmao I have a toon called diddler as well but it's a gnome warrior
---
4 mages getting 3% crit plus the boomer isnt gonna add up to as much dps as one mage without the 3% crit.  So whats the argument for having one less mage and a boomer if the main talking point for bringing a boomer, the 3% crit actually isnt a net benefit but merely "not too much of a loss".
---
I think 6000 vs 4000 plays out a lot different than 1800 vs 1200. The servers are too big.
---
Sucks to be a dot based dps class when debuff limit means you're pushing off more important things like armor debuffs and resistence debuffs.
---
That and their mana efficiency is garbo, so they're like boomkin/ele shaman. Just don't have the stamina for longer fights.
---
Playing this game is the reason most people lose their career's and get depression isnt it?
---
Because AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Is the level 55 mage water quest available before level 60?
---
Usually its 1 hour respawn times but seem to increase if they've been fished multiple times prior. I was lucky enough the other day to get 4 essence of water out of one pool.
---
What inventory addon is that?
---
nope
---
Nice name :)
---
There are 16 debuff slots on a target. If you're a priest you have Shadow word pain, vampiric touch, shadow weaving, Racial specific like devouring plague. Obviously you can count out VT and a second SW, but at minimum you're going to want SWP up.
---
Your SWP won't do as much damage (or increase damage taken by) as some other debuffs, which means it would be a raid damage loss to let you use it. It would depend on the raid comp/raid leader etc as to if it matters or not though.
---
Or maybe people just want a better overall PvP experience while playing on the PvP server?
---
Like, you realize that the general state of PvP CAN be better than it is right now, right?
---
Because they look stupid and shsdowmeld mind control is fun
---
Never seen a healer being able to reserve orbs on my realm. 
---
This is only about tanks being less available than most other roles and not about them earning the right to stuff.  
---
A lot of other classes are doing stuff that goes unnoticed but can still clutch a bad encounter.
---
That's a staple of everquest grouping and I've always loved it when I'm in the group left behind but I've resented having to wait forever to leave when I'm in a hurry IRL.  So... yin/yang or whatever.
---
Wait, you completely missed the point of the post? Reading comprehension is a thing? Wait what?!?
---
First MC run last night. We 1 shot all bosses minus Gehenes due to some weird angle / LOS issue.
---
MC seemed stupid easily compared to 16+ years ago or whatever...I just don't ever remember downing rag that quickly until we had some MC gear amongst our DPS and yet I'm in there tossing 500 damage frost bolts with zero trinkets and ZF shit.
---
Weird.
---
I agree.   I especially like that the end of the zone is called the "Bitter Reaches".   
---
This is also where you go to farm the silver needed to do the love potion quest in the Grim Guzzler.
---
ITT people who never actually played vanilla to know that this is a total clusterfuck right now
---
I hope your head won't explode reading this, but warrior players in average aren't better/more skilled/divine persons than players of other races.
---
Also, warriors aren't the only class that has a hard time farming, but, let's be honest, there are enough ways to make money, you just gotta pick a way that works for you. In some cases that's honest work like mining, fishing, trading, luck and in some cases that's taking cash for doing 1/5th of the groups work in an instance.
---
Sadly, since the majority faction started camping raid entrances with 200+ ppl on raid nights, making even a PvP fight impossible because if lag and preventing any guilds from our faction to enter raids on time with world buffs; as well as permanent enemy raids farming everyone for honor in every zone, people leaving the game in droves, p2 killed the game for me and I just told my guild I was quitting. 
---
You don't have to impose that on yourself, and even if you try justifying to yourself that it's worth playing the game, playing a black and white walking simulator is just not what I want to do with my free time. P3 might improve the situation, but world farming (80% of vanilla content) is barely accessible for the minority faction. If you enjoyed the game up until now, and now don't enjoy it anymore that's perfectly fine. Don't lock yourself in a single game and allow yourself to move to something else.
---
pls equip a shield.
---
I feel like the Blasted Lands has that whole fallen hero questline which is decently long. That said I'm not sure anything has compared with STV having quests all the way from like 30 to 50.
---
If you are clearing mc and bwl every week then on the off chance you even need to run dungeons anymore,  your group is going to be so insanely overgeared that cc doesnt even matter anymore. What dungeon needs cc that only a frost mage can provide really?
---
I think you seriously lack experience of Classic. In most situations and equal gear and skill level, rogues cannot win against retribution paladin whatsoever. Druids of any specialization also have a hard time. Mages are even. It is either getting destroyed or using every cool down possible. Priests will probably get deleted as well as they only have a fear that will be trinketed instantly. Warriors are just the worst 1v1 class in the game so there is no need to explain. Hunters are strong against retribution and they are likely to win. Shamans are just a lesser version of retribution in a 1v1 context. They don't have nearly the same utility so without a lot of windfury procs it is pretty much RIP. Warlocks are the best 1v1 class in the game and a paladin would need the armorsmith trinket or to be an engineer to win.
---
I hope this helps you.
---
May god bless you with some iq friend.
---
People who play a male Tauren enhancement Shaman, how many times has the melee range of Male Tauren shamans helped you avoid death? 
---
Be it PvP or PvE
---
Keep in mind edgies really only needed whatsoever for raids . No need for instances or pvp at all
---
I hate people like you. If you aren’t a fatass neckbeard with no job and plays for 18 hours a day then you’re considered a casual.
---
Solid fight and solid ending. We shall call it a draw.
---
My experience with Lightshope is that wPvP was very light when the 3 BGs were operating especially considering that each weekend was double honor in one of the BGs.   (not sure if they will do that in Classic like Vanilla)
---
No, you’re wrong. 
---
The reason locks aren’t as good now is that there is so little hit gear available. Mages get tons of hit through Elemental Precision.
---
The absolute overpowering feeling of needing to belong even over playing the game.
---
I mean sorry to say dude but if 19 is the max you level a char too before switching you’re gonna be in a lot of trouble sticking around for the real Grinding levels of the game.
---
Because it's for paladins?
---
The technology just isn't there yet.
---
That's what I'm saying. Specifically in the case of p1 it's better scaling to give mages the mageblade and warlocks the staff. When ZG is out locks should be getting that staff before mages because they will do more damage with the increased sp than mages
---
You are trying to be sarcastic. The game is not designed around never dying. There are ppl who actually do iron Man, but I do not believe the broad audience actually want that. 
---
But I do believe that the enjoyment of this game comes from playing the actual content, even the levelling part. At the end of the life cycle, I usually feel finished and at that stage the character is not really important.
---
But you still have a point, the players who just collect stuff to hoard, my proposal is not for them.
---
-	Has a 5 to 1 population advantage
---
-	Has the audacity to call the other faction soft
---
Imagine making fun of someone who is proud of an accomplishment that took a long time to complete.  I mean, this subreddit would be dead without people of his excitement posting in general.
---
Heya! Last week i manged to get my hands on the full t1 set, do i just replace chain heal whit a equal mana costing healing wave and focus on tank healing now?  ( for the armor on crit buff)
---
Rip my ability to mirror png's correctly
---
Kinda related, here's a shortcut in dustwallow to get from theramore to barrens. There's a chain of 3 islands in a line, starting south of the guard tower. South of the last island there is a way to get up on land. Also very useful to get to the warlock lady. On mobile so I wont draw it but it's not hard to spot the three islands on the map.
---
Locks will have scaled past mages so as a mage lead I will be insisting on getting them to the warlocks first
---
Private servers would reset quite "often" and every time they were peaking with players. 
---
I see your point, but you're overlooking the fact that so many things only happen once in the game.
---
&gt; And I'm telling you now, there's no better feeling than your main tank saying, "that actually saved me." yea mate I know it did and now I'm oom
---
ftfy
---
Newsflash: The game is ruined by shitter casuals AND try hard neckbeards. The game is only fun when you surround yourself with the normal people in the middle who are serious enough to not waste time but not so try hard they ruin shit.
---
They used to respond to tickets about it in Vanilla and force name changes but now you basically have to use the auto report system (which does work after a number of reports).
---
Grow a pair and speak your mind.
---
You had me at victory dance. Love that boomkin dance
---
This is the strangest part. “Every knows if you’re you’re on a PvP server you have got pick Horde”. If everyone is Horde, how are you going to PvP?
---
No, no, no, wrong!  It’s someone else’s fault if you’re having a bad time in game, always.  Get out of here with that personal responsibility and maturity bullshit!  Have to learned nothing from this sub?!
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Meh it's more important to have everyone bring consumables.
---
And who wants to equip that additional mage?
---
Passive income is a good thing, you should try it someday.
---
I thought "yes" from the title but after reading it I don't really think so.
---
What gear and enchants are you using on this character?
---
It's no coincidence that I play on a PvE server, to avoid the horrors that have been prominently featured in this sub ever since P2 was released.
---
You aren't the asshole. If I were you I would state it very flatly when someone asks you to tank content you don't need that you have conditions for you giving your time, that being you get item X in Y dungeon. You don't have to be greedy, but you should get something from your time. Being a guild officer doesnt mean you should carry the whole guild through content only for their benefit. If those asking you to tank for them, making their experience much easier, don't like your terms, they can go find a less geared, less experienced tank to run them.
---
Lol the damage control on this post is insane. Like I understand your advice might be solid, but the fact that the top response to this post (which has been posted too often to be fair) is that “lol just log on in the middle of the night bro,” is insane. 
---
Open paid server transfers. Blizzard is losing so many people to this.
---
Get 300 engi, 3 reflectors, 10 stacks of hr-bandages, 100 free action pots, 50 limited inv pots, 300 nades, 200 heal pots, spider belt, net-o-matic, some sappers, goblin helmet, a good  amount of teas, Poisons and general rogue mats, try to reach around 4k HP unbuffed if you play solo.
---
Once you have all of this, go to zones like tanaris, silithus, badlands, winter spring and other popular 48-60 zones and start shredding clothies
---
They're probably just playing more, but you don't know it because you're not on 24/7. The fact that there's no punishment for dying makes it so that whoever's more destructive and neglects more of their real life will get the top ranks. 
---
A good way to check this is to compare it to live arena achievements. They rarely correlate, as the kinda people who spend all their waking time are rarely naturally talented people (no offense).
---
Go google how to be constructive in your comments
---
Rogues, how do you fight mages ?
---
It doesn't seem that bad. Some nights are rough but all around I find lights Chapel in EPL the only real bad spot. And like the odd time TP. I havnt been to ungoro since p2 dropped lol. 
---
 Azhara I met some random hordes and they just waved at me thankfully lol. I've tried a few 1v1 but as a deep holy priest it's hard for a guy lol.
---
If you think the game has gone too fast and aren’t a 60 right now, then yes, I consider you a casual.
---
I am a university student, and many of my guild mates and other people I know who play are married with children, work demanding or students themselves. Some of them raid log, but they still made it to 60 in reasonable time.
---
I can never understand why Blizzard don’t seem to learn from their mistakes.
---
Those games have nothing to do with wow.
---
I jotted on my friends d3 account, got it banned and all his games are fine.
---
Also I’ve been sharing wow accounts with friends for years.
---
I used to charge the same for randoms(not guildies). Premium tanking mind you, deep prot war half T1 geared. Usually id find a run within 5 10 mins but Id inevitably get memed by some smartass rogues, especially on the discord server people. 
---
Screw you Noggenfogger.
---
"You think you do but you don't." Bro I know what I want. I'm literally not playing the game at this point. The reason I play the game is pvp, and that doesn't exist on Skeram. 
---
Inb4 bgs are coming -- they are no where near as engaging or dynamic as world PVP *to me*.
---
Does limited people who pay the same money based on race work for you, racist?
---
Thanks!
---
The amount of people that get an emergency phone call right after a boss dies is staggering. I hope they're all ok.
---
“Premeditation”
---
More than you think due to shard exploiting with not having to reset the instance and could farm baron endlessly
---
Lots of Memories! Azhol-Nerub was a pretty good server. Thanks for the memories.
---
Imagine playing 8 hours for 10k honor XD
---
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
Wpvp should be more natural after BGs people who are fighting over farm spots will engage in combat and there will be occasional gsnking but far less camping and death squads roaming the world
---
then it will be a guild vs guild race. Also, we can fight the other guild for recruiting and maintaining members. Not to mention, in the first week we had 82 of the top 100 spots (our guild PvP rooster consists of 95 players), including standings 1-20 entirely. Required playtime was 5 hours daily.
---
As others have said if a warrior gets in on you and you don't bait his pummel you're dead. he's probably going to use reck on you if he has it because he knows you can wombo him as fast as he can you, except you've got heals. I find I can handle rogues pretty well if they're bad with their control. Poison cleanse totem is underrated and a bad rogue won't swap targets to kill it. If you can, position your poison cleanse totem and then kite the rogue away from it. Priests can give shamans alot of problems because they're tanky, you waste mana on the purges for bubble to get damage in and then you need to decide if you're going to kick the mind blasts or mans burns. If you kick one they'll do the other and one way or another drain your Mana. If you go to heal and they're close enough they will move in for a scream. Tremor will stop scream if they haven't wanded it (which they should).
---
Just transfer. You wont regret it
---
This is not even bad
---
The US govt invented the TCPIP stack. Many iPhone tech comes from research by NASA.
---
Capitalism is absolutely a race to the bottom you bootlicker.
---
Judging by this sub though you'd think every single server is like this
---
I probably will. Have 4-5 friends I need to convince to join me first.
---
The hope that once horde realize how long their ques for bgs will be and the grind for honor will take ages, they will fuck right off
---
If I wanted to totally try-hard mode on not dying as a melee in MC what fights/trash should I use restorative and GFPP?
---
Meh resto druids are consistently our best healers but after 2 or so of them hots don't stack.... So. Having an extra 2 bres in the raid (2 feral or 1 feral one boomkin) can be fun.
---
Downranking starts to be important when you're in decent healing gear (~200 healing power and higher).
---
I healed 688 health for 153 mana, 4.5 health per mana
---
I healed 863 with rank 5 healing wave for 198 mana, 4.3 health per mana point.
---
I healed 1827 with rank 9 healing wave for 554 mana, 3.3 health per mana point.
---
R4 gives 36% more health per mana bar compared to R9.
---
ooh damm... is it that bad? was told teh 8/8 adn 5/8 tier bonus combos quite nicely for a good while, but yeah your right on the bonus healing, sitting at 280 atm ( whitout a weapon enchant)
---
i need nothing outside of raids and log in once a week to do them
---
the PVP does not really effect me at all TBH
---
Vanilla WoW was made for casuals by the way.
---
The Qiraji avoid ungoro entirely. Those obelisks dissuade them from going near the crater for some reason.
---
I buy stacks on stacks of eels, faps, and elemental earths
---
I've been playing this game since original beta dude. And I'm capped. I literally wouldn't even want to admit the amount of /played I've accrued in my time playing WoW. The current state of things is nothing like what it was back when the honor system originally dropped. There is way more people active on the server and literally 20x more min-maxers and way more gank squads roaming around in the end game zones.
---
How would having BG's "ruin the game" anyways? If you don't want the AV rewards in the game yet just release WSG. They already released DM early, presumably because some people were running out of content to do
---
But those things are going to happen on PVP servers, and they could happen on PVE servers if you're flagged. Look, we're not saying "you have no right to be upset", we're saying "you picked a server where this can happen, and now you're complaining that it happened? Stop".
---
Bruh....u know your playing BFA classic...classic is less like classic.... Private servers did it better...
---
I have a 60 with 6 pieces of t1 loot, other MC gear and an alt in its 40s on the same server. I wouldn’t consider myself remotely casual with how much time I spend playing the game. The current state of ‘wPvP’ is dogshit
---
It’s not just bad for ‘casuals’
---
ok 2 locks, all 20 mages in the raid get mageblade before you. next raid you will have 0 locks
---
Still cheaper.
---
AFAIK just 1 on my server
---
I think a much, much higher percentage of guilds will be going into later raids in Classic than did in Vanilla.
---
I laugh hard at this. Having talisman, choker, ring of spell power, rob of volatile power and staff of dominance as a moonkin. No matter what people say or think I will have a decked out Moonkin. Can't wait for our first Lokamir drop.
---
Might aswell try but being completely outnumbered faction wise on a server is aids.
---
Activision, not cutting costs, good one
---
If you click on the actual item you see its added in p1.
---
Huh. I feel like I’ve died outside of SM and then ran into GY to Rez. Maybe it was still within that allowed distance.
---
I make thorium shells, about 40s profit over selling the mats
---
You are right now I see it, " Added in content phase 1 ". I didnt look in that corner, silly me. Thank you :)
---
Damn I need that cloak too... lol
---
Everyone is impatient, and self centered. When *they* are ready for it, it's time to do it *right now*.
---
Sure, but letting those who rarely play dictate how the game should be harms those who actually play it and spend time in it.
---
People know what happened to Retail. I mean, this sub shit on anything related to Retail. When not shitting on Retail, it is crying about Classic not being how they want it and that all the people are 60 and tryhards.
---
Before Classic came out, I remember people cherishing world pvp and looking forward to it. See BGs come out and people crying because the «fatass neckbeards» are doing premades.
---
I can already see the Reddit posts.
---
J. Allen Brack was right. You think you do, but you don’t.
---
Just don't run dungeons with your guildies, go profit off randoms instead.
---
The faction that has it "easier" is the one that has to farm less honor to achieve ranks. The faction with more people involved in PVP has it easier. The quantity of honor you get per kill depends on static factors (level and PVP rank of target modified by how many times you've killed them recently). But the number of people at each PVP rank is derived as a percentage of the total number of people on the faction PVPing. If you're on the faction with more people PVPing you can usually rank up with fewer kills.
---
In Vanilla there were some small dead servers where getting HWL/GM was mathematically impossible as there were insufficient number of people on your faction PVPing to hit the 0.1% threshhold.
---
You can spam arena/jailbreak/angerforge runs. You just do those parts and reset.
---
It doesn't, but it's not a part of the game at all.
---
If you know what you want then transfer already. Why ask here if you're just going to argue with everyone giving a different opinion?

Anathema.... I’m ready to quit as a horde so gl with no enemy’s
---
In the beginning there was no +shadow damage gear
---
You clearly don’t have the addon nor have you actually tried what you just suggested is possible... because if you had you would know that you can’t place raid markers on enemy players. Why talk out of your ass?
---
You mean the butt stuff?
---
i left noggenfogger for morgraine much better also much more populated go there!
---
It’s hilarious that all of you are posting stories and things that happened in retail wow. So in other words yes, everyone thinks the servers will die because of their retail experience. 
---
Or you are one of these people that believe a 3 day raid schedule is the game, and it is boring so people will be bored, right.....
---
Casting by Razorgore EU :thinking:
---
I got 2 on my road to 60, and 2 at 60 farming the dragons in Winterspring for my Hunter Quiver. I ended up farming them for a week before giving up and buying the quiver off the AH for 500g.
---
I guess I wasn't clear in the post. Thought the title was enough. I'm just trying to gauge the population balance of Heartseeker to make sure it is the reverse. 
---
Also someone telling me I won't like it isn't an opinion.
---
wich means more getting camped and farmed u mean
---
That's too rough of a take. Best way to figure it out is to do a full raid with 8/8 T1 equipped while focusing on Healing Wave to get the set's benefit and compare on logs how it went VS using a full +healing set! I would be really interested in the results to be fair :)
---
Might be difficult to get the gold and enchants for twinks without a high level character to make gold.
---
And that's their choice. I wonder why they would do that, maybe people kind of hate when they are constantly getting ganked like by a level 60 rogue camping a ship between low level zones so he can kill people twice saying it for the lols but it's really cuz they are an ass
---
Yes of course.
---
not gonna bother reading all that shit when it's pretty obvious you can't wrap your head about people liking different things than you. Get a grip xD
---
Drugs?
---
What keys do you bind your heals to?  Do you downrank lesser healing wave too?
---
I’m thinking about binding:
---
1 to CH R3
---
2 to CH R1
---
3 to GHW R9
---
4 to GHW R5
---
5 to GHW R1
---
6 to LHW
---
That was a good run crys in warlock
---
You first, you seem to need it more than I do.
---
I don't understand this. Those 400 horde can't all be getting honor. Why do they stick around?
---
Couldn't you guys transfer when the queues were high? I know you cant now.
---
Why do you even bother? If they will release TBC, it would be done on a new server, feel free to transfer your char there to play BC or keep in on classic server.
---
Yeah I'd just go farm gold and chill play some other games, wow isn't going anywhere and it's only 3 weeks more.
---
Sounds like you should roll a tank if its so fun, easy, lootfest.  Most DPS are such clowns.  We joked about it the other day we saw a LFG “3 dps, just need tank/healer.”  Thats like saying “single dude looking for 3some.  Just need two gals.”  DPS is the easiest role.  Its not close.
---
I don't think Blizz is dumb enough to do that this fast. 
---
The small minority of 'consume all the content NOW' players might go away if they dont, but that's okay. That's not the majority of players - and subscribers IS the whole idea behind being a gaming company. 
---
Let the losers get mad, take their 'firsties' and go home. We don't need them.
---
I was alt tabbed :D
---
I respec a lot. It seems like if you were just specced into something, Respec, then talent back into it, you don't need to buy it again. But if you have a talent trained, Respec out of it for a while, then Respec back into it later, you will need to train it again. Exact limits and such I am not sure of, but this appears to be the way it works.
---
If you charge your guildies for tanking for them, be sure to pay your healer for healing you and raid leader for spending their time and attention on you.
---
If you don't want to tank for them, just don't tank for them.
---
It is only for AV? I clearly remember that wasn't the case for WSG back in vanilla 1.12. If it is only for AV there is no problem. AV is less honor/hour even compared to WPvP.
---
I'm grinding my fishing to 300 as we speak so I can start doing fishing+mining runs
---
Whats the effective difference the person on the receiving end?
---
People liked TBC. I don't care if you don't like it, a lot of people loved TBC arguably more people than who loved vanilla. Is it a slippery slope to just go by expansions? Sure, no clue what blizzard will do after wrath. But classic to wrath buys blizzard about 5 years of solid content for almost no effort. That's too good of a deal to pass.
---
It depends on your luck with Seal of Casino RNG. One downside of ret is that every win looks to your enemy like "wow you got lucky on procs" unless its a total dunking.
---
You just use 1 hot and declick the rest haha
---
Baron, Rag
---
The trash right before and after Baron/Shazz
---
You’re in college now, and you played classic? Were you 5 years old then?
---
Because I played classic back then, and world PvP was not like this. There were battles in hillsbrad, but FPs were rarely camped. Low level players were ganked, but not nearly as much as they are now. Most people didn’t level to 60 within the first month, there were not multiple guilds who cleared all of MC in 3 months.  
---
My point is, you’re blaming casual players for ruining the game, while the people who play maybe 1 hour a day are complaining that they are spending that small amount of time corpse walking. 
---
Do you see the difference?
---
Shadowed frame units
---
Do you People just not read? When did I say it was fun? Ive played a tank many times, but in classic it is boring imo.. I dont understand why you peoplr are so selfish.. You are in a guild, help eachother without being crybabies about it, im just glad im not in a guild with people like you..
---
I started an alt on Grobbulus and it’s honestly disappointing to see how many people still don’t use RP names. I understand if you want to roll there and not RP but at least respect the people the server is made for and use an RP name. Feels like 75% of people have some absurd pun for a name
---
&gt; use a little bit of critical thinking
---
You mean to do the exact thing I've been doing when I look at numbers? Why would I compare all characters when the problem is groups of 60s, and the best way to counter is with Alliance 60s? 
---
Heres some critical thinking for you: just because someones disagrees with you doesnt mean they are wrong or are using bad practices. 
---

Nobody really needs to reroll, things just need to be redistributed. Earthfury is 50/50 right now, but it looks like we dont have any Alliance uploading the last couple of days. Every time but today that I've checked Alliance outnumbers at 60. You can see from the activity though we dont have Alliance numbers from the last few days, so it probably still skews Alliance.
---
Herod was 44/55 the last time I checked, as were many PVP servers (checking various servers over the last 2-3 days).
---
While these are unofficial numbers, the collection method is pretty decent. Blizzard probably wouldn't release fine grain numbers, like excluding alts and stuff. The major difference is Blizzard would have all data points, while we only have a few. That doesnt make the data wrong.
---
I just want Classic. If we start doing reruns, we'll eventually end up at the bad expansions again and who the fuck wants that?
---
The Classic population would drop like a stone if TBC was implemented. The Classic servers would have to be aggressively merged at that point.
---
I played orc on Elysium, and leveling up was a constant gangbang on the alliance players, this was when "give us vanilla" was gaining a lot of momentum, and many people new to private servers rolled. The starting zones were wall-to-wall with players.
---
I don't even bother loggin in except once a Week for MC/Ony.
---
Yeah this is kind of like complaining about players using Spy. This is the system Blizzard gave us, so you either do what you can with what you're given, or you intentionally gimp yourself and fall behind.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
What the heck is shard exploit?
---
Well, you're not asking a warrior why they aren't running around bandaging people while the boss is still alive, right?
---
Their brains must be addled from excessive soylent consumption
---
Like a glove.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.  Blizzard doesn't give a shit if you're emulating an identical keypress across infinite windows, as long as its 1 key = 1 action.  Its not automated, its emulated, you still have to hit 5 keys to do 5 actions.
---
Literally the exact same thing can be accomplished with hardware, you're just upset when people do it with software that you probably don't even understand.
---
&gt; was wondering what happened in private servers?
---
They didn't hide their stats, and if servers went worse than 45/55 the would just add faction queues.
---
Blizz does nothing, and they hide their stats. So a lot of people are stuck on shit servers which they didn't even realize until layering was removed.
---
That’s 3 to 6 months.
---
Also playing WoW as much as he is, is only going to make it worse
---
I watched this when you posted it. I wasn’t near ready to try it yet so I kept it saved.  I’ve been doing it now for about 2 weeks and has been great. As long as you can buy the leathers for cheap enough it doesnt take much to at least break even.  Sometimes you’ll get unlucky with essences. 
---
Sometimes I’ll DE 20 of them and get 14 essences and sometimes I’ll get like 5, but overall this strat has been great.  
---
I buy the leathers at under 1g40s a stack. The essences sell for about 4g each on my server and a stack of dust sells for about 11g.  I’ve made about 400g in the last couple of weeks. 
---
Easy money. Would recommend. Thanks for posting.
---
WTF is curse of mortal strike? Gehennas does something like that in MC but does someone else do it too? I don't even read the things I decurse anymore, I see purple on the raid frame I hit the button.
---
I can see a non-officer tank getting away with the greed, but as an officer, your "duty" is to help your fellow guild mates,regardless if you get a short-term reward or not. That is the price you must pay for your rank. Mind you, you are setting up your guild's culture in these early stages of the game. If you feel like you must be compensated for lifting a finger to help guild-mates, then that is how your guild-mates will treat you and future recruits. Sure, you don't get any materialistic value from doing old dungeons but the long-term reward is that you are sowing the seeds in your guild that guildmates should help other guildmates in times of need and soon enough these guild mates will be geared on their own and help new recruits get their gear without asking for favors in return.
---
[classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) is not a valid source especially not for boss armor.
---
Can't wait for BC. It had amazing PvP and balance. And the world was amazing.
---
No BG queues, lots of Pks available in the world, not even many bad lickings if you hit 60 in the first week. Alliance also has paladins and in many people's opinions, superior PvP racials.
---
And yes, I have no problem destroying newbies in an MMO, but as Alliance you'll have to be on your toes not to die to the zerg. Better than running around as 30 horde looking for a single PK.
---
They have awesome racials and, like you read 10x a thread, people knew pvp servers were going to be imbalanced in favor of the horde. 
---
If people truly wanted to play an underdog, they’d roll alliance on a horde dominate server.
---
YTA. Shouldn't charge gulidies imo
---
It was worth it for the "cavalry" charge.
---
Gotta agree with most comments here.. I can’t really sympathize with you. You brought this upon yourself when you decided to play a server that was built around streamers with huge fan bases.. Sorry man it sucks but you should’ve known it would be like that..
---
I'll bet you an epic going mount they release tbc classic
---
I loved enhancement while leveling. It can be frustrating if the wf procs aren't in your favor, but seeing things go from full to almost no health with one auto was so satisfying.  I'm 60, and rocking 30/0/21 and highly recommend switching to Ele at 40 when you get Elemental Fury, same feeling of obliterating things.
---
You can pretty much heal anything at anytime while leveling if you have the appropriate gear. Although I'm sure some people have pulled it off, I feel this caps off around Mauradon and ZF lvl range.
---
Well, for one thing they could showcase the stats on every server so pople could see that X server has 40% alliance and would pick alliance on that server, as oppoes to it just being a guessing game, where you won't even really notice until you hit your lvl 30s.
---
I think you missed the point... lol
---
You may be right. I've been looking for someone to craft these for weeks and haven't found anyone that can craft or seen anyone wearing them. I dont think they're in game yet
---
Fuck for really though. Arenas and sunwell. How can you go wrong?
---
Calm your autism, alot of people liked tbc
---
Ok Boomer.
---
i was lvl 22 on that server so u can be pro af u will not stand a chance
---
Yeah, the sub you pay for can become the sub you don’t pay for anymore. Or, the same way you pay for car insurance but you don’t need to use your car everyday? 
---
Stop being so entitled and naive. The game has flaws. Blizzard is trying to fix them. Stop bitching.
---
Gamers were unironically cooler back then.
---
I seriously hate the amount of pun names we have now. I also avoid associating with special character (è ä etc) names at all costs.
---
Onslaught for retpaladins
---
ToEP for elemental shamans, oomkins
---
To name keypieces that every DPS will want over hybrids.
---
You can be raiding Naxxramas and still not have ToEP for each and everyone of your 8 mages and 4+ warlocks.
---
they ain't got no tegridy 'round here no more
---
Small brain mindset. 
---
There are going to be more fights after the boss so more mana is still more better. 
---
Besides, int also is crit.
---
Yea, thanks to Reddit and their nonsense, it's likely that Alliance players are leaving even servers they dominate. These numbers were much better just a couple of days ago.
---
So you guys basically creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, grats.
---
Lol casual
---
Thanks for this I’ll probably get the ring and respec
---
No just because a signal is given to 5 windows does not make it 5 action. For all intends and purposes you can either describe it as one action for every window. Or you can describe it as five simultanous button presses on one keyboard.
---
LeatrixPlus
---
Yeah people are taking classic raiding way to seriously. These people would bring an AR-15 to a nerf gun fight. 
---
This shit is so fucking easy, if your raid is seriously bitching about certain classes being sub par dps then they must be in a VERY shitty, low skilled raid group and should heavily consider finding a new guild. 
---
This is vanilla raiding folks. If you’re worried so much about these things then seriously just quit because you’re missing the point of this game.
---
I think you should get something out of it, time is money as they say, if you're running it to help them why shouldn't you get something out of it too?  Seems fair. Tanking is hard anyway.  Shout out to all you tanks out there for all your hard work! I admire the lot of you.
---
Wrong zone :P
---
But good suggestion! Submitted to https://classic.wowhead.com/azshara#screenshots
---
That first day in Hillsbrad was pretty awesome. Sadly it's not there anymore. We probably did kill each other!
---
You're just enabling shitty behavior.  Your analogy isn't even close to accurate, either.
---
Alright gotcha thanks for the inputs I’ll probably respec :)
---
Every single person on that server was lvl 22 at one point. They all seem to be doing fine... get your negative ass outa here!!!
---
It's playable now, you just suck ass.
---
Oops! Nice one :-)
---
Week 1 Kromcrush server, everybody wanted it and was willing to pay up to 80g. Now I would say 40g is closer to the going price.
---
yeah it's like 80&gt;20 Horde on this server out in the world, the allys that are out there are always 15+ grps so we kinda haft to stack too. Highest standing are always around 100k end of week.
---
Dude. I play a Mage. I have never gone OOM anywhere in Ony and MC. At most I’ve used a mana gem and evocated when the melee fucked up and got themselves killed on Ragnaros. But actually OOM? Just doesn’t happen.
---
They proc 5/2% of the time. Yes they proc from evis but you dont double evis.
---
Well my main is named Trapjaw so I can totally relate to your 2nd screen!
---
Sure. Its easy to be on the zerg faction on 8/10 pvp factions and say “the problem is the outnumbered faction not wanting to always fight 5v3!”. Whatever dude. If you were as good a pvper as you think you are youd be on Ally on Skeram getting it done
---
"INVITE TO ASMON LAYER"
---
On my server it’s been impossible to quest in ungoro crater as a level 52 because there have been two level 60 duos of alliance literally every day all day since the launch of P2 roaming around killing people. 
---
So there’s people playing the system then there’s no lifers doing that
---
It’s not worth your time to argue with this kiddo, he’s the same kind of person as the one depicted in this post and took it personally enough to belittle “casuals” (as if being a hardcore WoW player is an honor). 
---
It’s especially funny because he has no concept of how “casuals ruined the game” since he wasn’t old enough to be playing at a hardcore level during the legacy expansions.
---
&gt;I don’t care about ~~those~~ players
---
He doesn’t care if people play the game, he’s be happy playing by himself.
---
I was in a guild that only let Hunters roll on Strikers mark. What a joke. Quit that shit
---
it already lost most of its population. Stop trying to think classic is anything but low maintenance / cost crashgrab for blizzard. You wont get new content, you wont get a dedicated leaderboard, be thankful classic has suhc a low cost to running it, else you wouldnt even be playing it right now
---
Man, we've got different ideas. Azshara funded both my 40 and epic mount. I love that zone.
---
not a weapon proc but yeah that's true
---
If this was about honor, they’d stop attacking honorless targets. Christ, the worst part of this mess is people trying to defend the roaming band of 60 horde players killing the level 15s zoning into RED-RIDGE.

---

---
and its not. You classic fans are more delusional than guild wars 2 players
---
I kind of enjoyed my first choice of hunter until about 45-50ish, then I realized I kind of either hate the class or hate the specific grind I tried to accomplish. (Still got it to 60 though and at worst it'll be a gold farm option.) I loved dungeons and things that felt specifically favorable for hunters, but grew to dislike various other things. I now have multiple alts sitting in the 20ish range, and I'll be curious to see did I *actually* dislike the class choice or was it more to do with grind that starts happening at those levels. Like I suspect no matter the class choice I'll never particularly like reputation grinds.
---
or, more likely, you are just a classic fanboy

Someone clearly doesn’t have a job and/or significant other lol

It's not that bad of a matchup if you are specced properly. Dagger with imp sprint. But it's a very advanced high skillcap matchup so kinda hard to explain.

Hello? Keep gear in your bag and use ItemRack. Takes a half second to click a button to switch your entire gear set. PvP gear set. PvE gear set. They’re vastly different, you shouldn’t be using the same gear in both.
---
Lol@gatekeeping
---
&gt; not wanting to always fight
---
PVP servers are labeled as such because PVP may be mandatory. This includes "when you dont want to".
---
Or this data set is also incomplete
---
Yes, post 45/50ish is a real pain.
---
also worth mentioning, I guess you never played WSG, cus horde had long waits.
---
The screen and ground shaking too.
---
The T1 5 piece set bonus is for things you "don't do" as a raid shaman. Single target (tank or panic saves) healing isn't something you do often, focusing your itemization around something that isn't your primary job isn't ideal even if it is nice. In 5 man content you don't need raid gear to clear it so focusing your endgame set on content you can do without raid gear isn't required either.
---
The T1 8 piece is basically a walmart brand chain heal. If you're going to be healing multiple targets, it's better to go all in on chain heal
---
So you're looking at 335hp in full T1+healing enchant vs 500hp in a more HP focused set (I'm just using my gear, I'm not BIS for this phase but I'm getting reasonably close).
---
T1 set gives you a scaling of 1.05 health per healing power, while chain heal gives 1.24 scaling.
---
R1 chain heal gives 600 base healing with its bounces. T1 set equivalent is a midpoint between healing wave 5-6. If we err on the side of being favourable to T1 set, lets compare the more efficient r5.
---
R5 Healing wave 520 + 335*1.05 = 872hp for 198 mana. 4.4 hp per mp. We also need to account for the mana savings of 8.75%, 4.78hp per mp if we count mana savings as a flat % buff to healing.
---
R1 Chain heal 600+500*1.24 = 1220 for 257. 4.7 hp per MP.
---
Best case scenario, T1 set does beat R1 chain heal. But you're losing a lot of healing per second to be that efficient. In raid scenarios even R1 chain heal feels dangerously slow for the mana efficiency it brings. To get similar healing per second we need to push R6 or R7 healing out. We could make the disparity even higher if we pushed down the ranks to R4,.
---
R6 1214 healing for 262 mana gives 4.63healing/mp. But we're using the mana efficiency as a "healing power" buff, which means our healing per second is actually 8.75% lower. This is closer to R1 chain heal and R7 hw definitely blows mana efficiency to chunks. It's also stronger hps, but I'm trying to be a bit more generous to T1 set.
---
You could argue that healing way favours the T1 set, but I'm not sure how much impact it will have. As a raid healer you're not really healing the same target. Your job as an "aoe" raid healer to spread the heals around rather than top one person off to full. You could argue this is beneficial for tank healing, but shamans just don't suit the role of tank spammers compared to priests. They have much better raid healing ability, and less mana efficiency for keeping a tank alive.
---
The numbers actually came up a lot closer than I remember. However P3 changes things up. Going forward the three piece T2 set bonus definitely favours chain heal though because it increases the scaling power of chain heal even further. Having a set ready for that benefit is definitely something you should look into, but the full T1 set is reasonably close to a full healing power set.
---
I might also add that there is less competition for items, since they can use leather spellpower gear and maces.
---
I wasn’t suggesting that OPs grind was worth it, although I wouldn’t be so arrogant as to suggest how people spend their time in a video game, but I was directly responding to the guy who said that stacking all +damage is better than stacking +frost. He’s wrong.
---
Dungeons are *maybe* one case where stacking all +damage is better than frost but even then I’m dubious. Arcane explosion has a 14% coefficient so if you stacked an additional 100 + all damage, you’d get 14 more damage per AE. If you took that +100 frost instead, every frostbolt would do 88 more damage because it has an 88% coefficient. If you’re casting frostbolt *at all* the frost SP likely maths out better.
---
I honestly think the guy you're responding may have played vanilla, but more likely has played pservers a lot recently.
---
In these vanilla iterations with its high pop server it was: Adapt and perish. 
---
Therefore for me it's just no different than what I'm used to from pservers.
---
Group before flying to your FP, count down before take off in discord, find a nother group to start your adventure from Ironfore. 
---
In a way these pservers were more MMO than vanilla and these seeps into classic. People have no sympathy with solo players who dont want to play with others. 
---
If you play with friends 90% of your game time, things are enjoyable. Trying to level as level 53 in Burning Steppes on your own? Not so much.

I'll be curious to see what happens with Naxx in particular. It seems like a lot of guilds didn't progress far through Naxx and/or just threw their hands up in the air and waited for Burning Crusade. I wonder will history repeat itself or will Naxx actually be endgame content for a stretch for the more hardcore.

ok

this should be in game imo.  a website is outdated.

Do you use any kind of mod to announce in raid chat when you innervate a priest? I too will innervate a priest during raid and am looking for some way to remind everyone I’m not just sitting there doing so so heals.
---
Find a better guild? Mine is tight AF, we all know each other and are a team. Life is way better when the main reason you're in a raid is to chat and work as a team to accomplish goals
---
I would be very surprised if we don't see some iteration of Burning Crusade, even if it's like a server split or something. I see some people pining for WotLK but it feels like a lot of people want BC and not actually vanilla (though some like pure vanilla as well).
---
Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need.
---
I’m all for the pvp  as many others are you dumbass,  it’s getting ganked as an honorless target that stops me from leveling that is the issue. But sure act like nothing is an issue because you played all day and night and have your 60 fully geared with BiS while I sit over here corpse running for the few hours I get to play because a 60 wants to camp a lower level zone. At that point it’s not about the honor it’s about the griefing.
---
TBC was my absolute favorite. I would totally welcome more content in a fee years, just so long as they stop at Wotlk
---
better then being on a 50 50 server where  you cant even lvl
---
Imagine ruining an entire game by having a life and responsibilities? Sucks. I’ve played on average 14 hours a week and I’m level 51. That’s a huge chunk of free time spent. Everyone lives their lives differently, and that’s just fine. You want to sacrifice other responsibilities because you’re having a shit ton of fun playing WoW? That’s fine, power to you. But don’t attack others for spending their time doing things in real life that are absolutely more important than spending time in a fake fantasy world.

It's not just caster dps that benefit from the +3% crit. Healers also get the buff. All that together 1 boomer &gt; another mage you have to get gear for.  And it's going to be trivial to gear a boomkin bc who else wants +spell dmg leather gear.
---
Be me: lvl 58, warrior. Mob grinding and questing. WHAT can i use to get rid of terrible 30min debuffs by mobs while grinding or questing that literally make me so weak??? all stats red. Are purification potions the only thing?!?! HELP.
---
A lot of people want something for nothing in return. Shit if I ever had people higher level or completely overgeared helping to carry depending on their class id give them a stack or two of materials. (Cloth, ore if they were eng or BS, ETC..)
---
Wow, such a good example with the dps wars. I was a dps warrior in classic but I always wore plate and a lot of it was actually tanking plate. I didn't really get good dps plate gear til aq/naxx. But yeah whenever needed I could always slap on my shield and offtank w/e
---
nothing i replied with was negative whatsoever but ok boomer
---
That is playing the system...
---
Mageblade 100% but that 37 int is pretty wild
---
Hah people downvoting me cuz they got no clue. What can I tell you dummies, I did it - so can you. Enjoy not having your wand I guess? Try jumping on the ledge maybe, I usually did. It 100% works he just needs to walk to the right spot.
---
Same here
---
Dude just fucking quit if you are going to be a cry baby. I am only level 48 and I love the challenge. If I am getting camped I can move zones or do dungeons. Easy as that.
---
I won’t be playing for a month or two. Level 48 rogue with a 60 paladin main, neither of them are allowed to play the game outside of dungeons
---
I had a good group for LBRS, first run i got my loot I wanted and I knew i had to log in 30min, so I still went one more run with the guys even though i didnt need anything anymore so they could find a replacement in the meantime.
---
&gt; Only people who have cleared most of the content and want to farm honor think it's a good time for everyone else it's garbage. 
---
No, we think its garbage too, but the system incentives it.
---
wrong, arcane explosion is in fact better on 3 mobs thanks to base damage. Almost every pull has more mobs than 3, too.
---
It is 14.28% AOE, so obviously you multiply that by the number of monsters, and the number of casts. AE is 1.5 seconds, 3 frostbolts = 5 explosions by the duration. Then if there's 4 monsters, spellpower will benefit 14.28*20 = 285.6 over 7.5 seconds, which is already more than 3 frostbolts over the same duration.
---
*sad dwarf noises*
---
Heartseeker is fairly balanced after the horde only transfers. Most night BRM trades off between horde and alliance.
---
Dungeons are a part of this world. My point was that there are plenty of dungeons to do so you’re not “spamming” them and doing something different each time. 
---
But damn people are soft. They have PvE realms for a reason.
---
Aaaaaand its gone!
---
[https://writingexplained.org/role-vs-roll-difference](https://writingexplained.org/role-vs-roll-difference)
---
No, I’m comparing your expenses, considering you were yet again bitching about money. But this is the catch — you NEED insurance. You don’t need this game, bub. Shit or get off the pot.
---
Hey, which addon gives that detailed item info?
---
I haven't heard of this let alone seen people defending it
---
It is, because at some point people will call for classic servers again...
---
Thank you again then! Idk why someone would just randomly downvote comments.
---
With the tone of your post, i'm gonna guess that you are pretty salty and tried to come with an idea to break horde's balls (by trying to force transfers) so you could be less mad during your corpse run. Drink water, exhale slowly and it will pass :)
---
It's a long term goal of mine lol for now I'll stick to the basics
---
I get ganked constantly by Alliance stronger than me for the free honor. But yea dude always and easy mode 💯💯👌
---
I'm an ele/resto hybrid. I have a lot of pvp related spells that need to be on close keys, so I get deep into modifiers.
---
regular heal is r, shift r, ctrl r. chain heal is g and shift g. You don't downrank lesser healing wave because it's a panic button and not meant to be mana efficient. I have a couple spots I could put lesser, like ctrl g or ctrl e. I just haven't got around to binding and practicing with it.
---
I prefer the modifier solution because the same key always does that particular spell. And I've never felt the need to have 4 ranks of the same spell, so normal/shift/ctrl is enough. I put the most commonly used ones on normal/shift and the least commonly used on ctrl since I find it less comfortable to press.
---
You can run to town and sort your bank/post auctions for the next 30 minutes - or figure out what kind of debuff it is (curse, disease, poison) and have an appropriate player dispel it.  This is kind of one of those classic things -debuffs that are actually pretty heinous.
---
You are missing that you are lying, how is dreamfoil and rich thorium ore average?
---
51 Ally on Skeram here, I just stopped playing my char. Grinded mobs to level 50-51, which still somehow Hordies hunted me down doing that. I’m just taking a break from my main until BGs arrive. Sick of giving Hordies honor points. I’ve gotten started on my alt though, which is nice. Maybe they’ll transfer if we all stop playing and they have no source of honor? Lol
---
What's your point? Are you just trying to shit in a depressed person? Is your life that small? Are you so tiny and in so much pain with the state of your own life you have to come into a thread and shit on people's last silver linings?
---
Or are you pointing out the PAINFULLY obvious to every person here, including the OP, that WoW isn't the answer to depression?
---
This was the world first Ony kill. Ruined still has a few people around from Vanilla and I still have a toon in there.
---
How is this different than all the already existing guides on zf farming? Good stuff tho.
---
They released phase 2 way to early.
---
Yeah I hate trying to find new servers to play on since I established myself on grobb, with the  names I reserved going go other servers with the names I want isn't happening lol
---
The raiding itself doesn't, but the gear farming and prep does.
---
Absolutely. I just feel like I see a lot of druids hot up the DPS frequently and then drink and miss out of damage when it isn't needed.
---
Druid is all about adapting to the situation, of course. If you need to heal or tank go for it, but it's often better to do the job you came as and the healer heal if they can handle kt.
---
Started at release and I'm just 45, mostly because my pc died and couldn't play for a month but I'm back in it now and cant wait to get to 60, but, I'm still taking my time and I have a nice guild that when I get there they'll all help me gear up and stuff :)
---
No said “OVER 9000?!!!”
---
You do know redridge is how alliance get to brd, right?
---
For the same reason that people talked about Classic before it released. People can look forward to things and also enjoy the current thing at the same time.
---
Yes he does. He just makes sure he’s logged in before they start.
---
Oh I agree 100%. This whole thing is quite a shitshow however.
---
This sounds really fun, I’ll have to do that with my guild
---
I disagree. If he helps people grind up pre-raid BiS or do attunements, that meets this criteria. But if someone wants to use him to grind up plans or mats or other things they make money off of, he is not obligated to help them for free, officer or not.
---
It isn't lower because it is percent based....
---
People have been doing this shit since the dawn of time (See the legendary Angwe as an example), so it's been real interesting seeing a fresh wave of butthurt against gankers.
---
Because a lot of people are just here for tbc/wrath, which were objectively better in most aspects.
---
Could check out HOTW/NS. It’s not as good at Raid healing but still perfectly viable, but it’s basically the optimal PvP spec in most situations, and let’s you tank dungeons. At this point I don’t even have a tank set, I use my healing set as long as it’s leather and mix it with high armor weapon/rings
---
Dude the bar is the same because it is percent based. The only way it is lower is if more people are going "hard" at PvP on one faction.
---
Whitemane is pretty bad
---
At 35 as a priest with levitate, I got myself to 420 fishing allowing me to fish in Bay of Storms where you can fish up essence of water. I was likely one of the first on my server doing this so I didn't have any competition. At one point I had ~50 essences in my bags. Sold a bunch off, held a bunch and made money when DM came out as prices went up. These days its much more congested especially without layers, so it's not really a worthwhile investment focusing 100% of your time on.
---
Now as a 60 if I don't feel like lasher farming, I will make a loop to the essence pools and see if I get lucky, make a loop around the zone for herbs, then stop in the southeast where the 54-55 naga are and grind for 30 minutes or so. Lots of greens and clams for a chance at Golden Pearls. 
---
Not the best way to make money, but a good mix of things that isn't strictly one thing. Also, the zone isn't congested at all.
---
3-4 ranks each week is not possible.
---
I rolled on Myrzael-US PVE server. It has a good population and still has world PVP. I can do everything I want and don’t have to worry about being ganked while leveling/questing.
---
For getting raid spots I’d suggest a “bare minimum” that must be met, with a sign up sheet, followed by a “soft cap” on the amount of any 1 class (with exceptions given to the same class filling different roles like warr tanks vs fury warrs).
---
So say for example you need 8 healers, 3 tanks, 4 de curses and 4 warlocks in order to do mechanics. You give top priority to the first people who signed up for raid that fill those spots. Once those spots are filled you fill up to your soft cap with the other classes in order of which they signed up. So taking the first 5 rogues who signed up, first 5 hunters who signed up, etc. I would continue with this until either the raid is full with a good mix of all roles, or until all classes have reached your soft cap and if the raids not full, you start accepting additional players for the role you still have room for. So if the raids not full and 8 rogues signed up, but you only have 2 fury warriors, you could invite the additional rogues.
---
Anyone who signs up and doesn’t get a spot should get priority for the following week at least, as well as be allowed to take the place of someone who doesn’t show up on time.
---
This is all assuming you’re not a super hardcore guild with just a few members above the 40 man cap. If you’re hardcore then basing it on attendance, contribution to the guilds success inside and outside of raids, ability to follow mechanics, etc should be much more important.
---
Yes but you have twice as many people competing to get the rank. It doesnt make it easier or harder.
---
ITT: People who never played vanilla pretending PvP didn't happen back then.
---
Fellow pserver player here that fits your description. I would say you hit the nail on the head. It's just a whole 'nother level of mentality. It really is an MMORPG when you have to consider such tiny details as flying to a fp at the same time to combat gankers when you land. I love it.
---
150 spots vs 100 spots.
---
Hey that was my vanilla server!
---
wotf &gt; 25% rng stun res all day baby
---
Damn bruh, 60,782! You must've been so close the week before, and probably standing 1 also.
---
We are clearly better than the horde. They are so much worse at pvp compared to us. The only way they can beat us is with sheer numbers. If we have a choke point though it takes 250ish horde to take out 60 Alliance. Last time they finally got in to brm and wiped us we all rezzed on top of them and sapper charged them. In a second we had the mountain back and they started gy rezzing because they never expected that kind of a play and decided to give up trying to get in.
---
Gonna be real if said people goal is to play end game I doubt they will stick around I was in this situation recently. Wasnt taken for two raids back to back so I went and pugged. Then got told I cant do that and I gotta raid with the guild I'm in so I left. I wasnt gonna miss out on playing content to sit and wait to be told it's my turn if said raiders are anything like me let them go pug when they cant otherwise they will probably leave. No one wants to spend there limited freetime waiting outside a raid entrance lol.
---
Dick move, bro - but hella funny
---
I don’t think it’d go past WOTLK. Let’s be honest, whoever wants a Cataclysm rerun is probably a psychopath.
---
Cataclysm destroyed the zone for me, the goblins ruined it with their industrialization. Sure, old Azshara has barely any quests but it’s so relaxing there.
---
Stand up. [https://i.imgur.com/qxETiqi.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/qxETiqi.jpg)
---
I’ve actually heard streamers talking about possibly transfering off, most notably Asmongold. So first they ruin a server with their cancer, then move on to the next.
---
You idiot
---
Good luck finding 20 new people every hour, ready outside the instance and willing to pay for boost hehehe
---
Must've simply been lag, or whatever causes rendering to delay. When I move around on my (not even epic) mount, rendering lags a lot. It's possible for mobs to render at 60y instead of the expected 100. So given the speed at which you travel on flight paths, it's not surprising at all that you'd only see something render right above you. And I suppose the combat log updates before the model renders ? That's the only explanation I have.
---
Spy does not detect anything outside your render range. I am 100% positive. And the recent changes made it so buffs don't cause detection by themselves, so it's normal that you can't detect them unless you target them.
---
Legend
---
I'd imagine he would've gained a level or two from exploration alone, yet he's still at level 1. Must have been summoned.
---
/r/wowclassicscreenshots
---
Would you still reccomend 5% or 6% hit even for an LFG Hero like myself with Edgemaster's?
---
This would be true if the distribution curve of people ranking was linear. Its not. Its a curve. Go have a think.
---
Wait, how is he wrong about the honor system? There's decay that you have to fight every week.
---
I’m also on Skeram level 51 Druid. I just stopped playing the Druid and started leveling an alt. Not worth giving them the honor. Maybe if there’s no ally to farm honor from, they’ll actually consider transferring
---
I wouldn't call it "surprising" that bored players with an overwhelming numbers advantage on a PVP-less game will sit and grief other players without anything else to do.
---
Is lasher farming still viable? I never did it pre-Classic but heard it was underwhelming.
---
I thought about the switch now that PvP is so prevalent everywhere, but I really like being near the top of the healing charts in raids with my current spec so I don't think I want to go the HOTW route.
---
I wouldn't call it laziness, but I would call it boring.
---
But I picked an unbalanced pvp server, took my time leveling, and rage at people who group up... can't I just cry on Reddit about how this is all blizzard's fault?
---
Also curious about the opposite. How often the range leads to death
---
They said a while ago it’s something they’d consider
---
Haha why did the recent world record of the fastest MC clear have a moonkin tho?
---
 "also using TSM interface to be able to see the whole vendor list "  ?  there's an option in TSM that will show the vendor limited recipes  even when they are out of stock?  or am i reading this wrong
---
This would be &gt;50% wrong, because MANY people think that anyone who doesn’t talk to other people while farming is a bot.
---
Not true, it's been updated several times in the last few days. Make sure you're up to date, mine is 100% spot on.
---
Ulda specifically was hard to find even when leveling with the pack it’s probably an anomaly
---
It’s an addon. Popular ones that look like that are Bartender and Dominoes.
---
fastest world record MC clear had a moonkin in it
---
No they didn’t. A majority of people had already burned through most of the existing content. Which is why Dire Maul was released early instead of with phase 2. But Blizzard should have known world pvp would become cancerous like it is given that a majority of servers have a faction disparity. Me and my guild were saying for weeks leading up to Phase 2 that it was going to be a shit show and that everyone needed to get their leveling and farming in before that. I have no idea how no one at Blizzard realized there would be issues. BG’s should have always been on the release schedule with Honor.
---
It doesn't prevent a person from farming dungeons, it just forces them to buy another account.
---
Logs say they're still better than paladin. Also they don't use dots.
---
That depends if the other mage has iceblock ;) Most PVE mages don’t
---
Around*
---
But running AV 1000 times is?
---
This is false. BWL has major upgrades
---
Boots of the Shadow Flame: Bis all of classic
---
Malfurions Bulwark: 2nd best chest in the game behind a Naxx drop
---
Taut Dragonhide Spaulders: Solid upgrade til AQ or AB shoulders
---
Taut Dragonhide belt: Only replaceable by 2 belts in AQ
---
Additionally theres
---
Elementium Threaded Cloak: Basically perfect druid mitigation itemization. Only replaced in Naxx
---
Master Dragonslayer Neck: best mitigation til Mark of Cthun
---
Archimetros Ring of Reckoning: Competitive ring for druids off raw stats
---
Drake Fang Talisman: Best threat trinket in the game for druids, though this is obviously one of the most contested items in the game
---
I may have missed something but those all stuck out
---
It gives you coordinates if you mouse over their name... So yeah it basically does.
---
One of the first things you do with friends playing WoW is explaining loot rules.
---
It did, but saying it was like this just isnt true.
---
Just pick one.
---
There’s really nothing more to it. Just pick one.
---
I'm geared the same way, I reserve all the orbs. Some people call it greed, I call it the only way I can reliably farm 50 gold per hour on a tank.
---
Well, it's possible.
---
But /reload does not do this. Reload makes your character run in place, but that's because your client is actually frozen. After the reload, you don't jump 30 yards forward. And during the reload, you sure as fuck can't be looking for a stealthed rogue. Reloading in a fight would just gimp you.
---
i work at walmart night shift 2 days a week (canadian walmart, better pay + night pay premium) and i live in a small town that has really low rent costs.
---
Or just sheep for 30 seconds
---
Tellmewhen addon: tracks any spell/buff/debuff/trinket proc you set it up to track.
---
If the servers could actually handle the load from world PvP then I would agree with you.
---
might be the cringiest thing I have ever read on this sub. Get a life my guy.
---
Imagine being this objectively toxic
---
Assholes all over reddit lol
---
&gt;we'll eventually end up at the bad expansions again
---
Why is that a problem? Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK servers will still exist.
---
Band of Accuria will be tank prio by most good guilds. DPS can use Tarnished Elven rings and it's relatively close but the high hit value and stam make it a major upgrade on tanks
---
A. Dwarf Priests are worse in Arcane spec than Night Elf Priests.
---
B. Some people don't do research before creating characters.
---
C. Some people who know about Fear Ward still don't like the visuals of Dwarves compared to Humans or Night Elves.
---
Take half hour to setup TeamViewer to your phone and pc ;)
---
So you can queue up ahead of the me from your phone ;)
---
Remember, Patience, discipline.
---
i mean my server still has 2.5k queues on peak times and i cant even move in orgrimmar because of the lag since theres too many people, doesnt seem too dead to me
---
I just did the /played time across the 2 characters mentioned. I’ve spent over 20% of my total time since launch playing the game. With working ~50hrs a week (land sleeping 6-8 hours a night, that’s honestly a disgusting and unhealthy amount of time playing a game.
---
I pretty much couldn’t have played more unless I had quit my job.
---
Also, I don’t see what’s so fucking wrong if someone wants to play a game casually and not risk sacrificing other aspects of their life for a fucking game...
---

Moonkin in fastest MC clear in classic history
---
Yeah I know right? How dare people be interested in more than 1 videogame at a time. Fuck those people, amirite?
---
I would never try to shit in anyone lol. That’s weird. 
---
I don’t encourage poor behavior that lead to more suffering. OP is using Classic WoW to ignore his real problems which will make them worse. I get this sub is filled with depression. Look at my history. I call out everyone for it. Get the fuck off this game and go talk to a doctor.
---
Good, you start catching up.
---
Bingo
---
It had dailies, flying and multiple difficulty content.
---
Oh, that's a simple one. Instant BG queues. 
---
Imagine trading easier PvP for a single month for eternal "Expected queue time 30min".
---
Mageblade, then get that AV offhand in a couple weeks
---
Mageblade always.  Has the same amount of spell power and crit on a one hand weapon freeing up space to add a spell power offhand.  Those with the Mageblade that grind the upcoming Alterac Valley for a week to get exalted will have 33 more spell power than those with staff of dominance with this exalted rep item.
---
Lhttps://classic.wowhead.com/item=19315/therazanes-touch
---
That's amount of spell damage is the equivalent to wearing an extra Ring of Spell Power.
---
Avoid roads and zones like STV like the plague - do lots of dungeons if it gets too bad.  Good luck, have batman.
---
If your guild isn't funneling resources to you as a main tank and officer, find a new guild
---
People beat me to it ... yeah none of that is doable with SPY. The made up nonsense continues. 99% of people in who bitch about SPY have no idea and just listen to the mass whiners.
---
Still offering transfers there?
---
Big if true
---
the 8 set kinda sucks....so why lol?
---
You still can, but you go through more consumables.  I find I need more Nightfin soup when I run HotW/NS build, especially on MC trash!
---
So what, the dedicated PvP players aim to be as efficient in their honor farm as possible, so that means that whenever they are in queue they will go out in the world and try to farm as much honor as possible at the same time.
---
Progress brought a Boomkin to their 25 minute clear:
---
https://youtu.be/jCNNe_UYDgY
---
Agreed, officer comes with responsibility
---
I know I'm not going to be raiding much, so finishing this set (and later upgrade) is my endgame.  Still gotta hit 60 first...
---
I have never heard that before.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Earthfury
---
Patch 1.12.0 (2006-08-22): The mana refund effect can now only occur once per [Healing Wave] spell cast. 
---
The way this is worded does make it seem like it could proc multiple times. But does the new wording mean it can't multiproc but still has a chance of proc on each bounce, or does it mean the base spell is the only one that can proc?
---
Hopefully someone with full T1 could confirm that for us.
---
Judging by the scene outside his window, what city do you think he’s in? I’m guessing Miami or LA...?
---
Vael doesn't bump people into lava, but she kills one person every 15 seconds. Your DPS max has to be a lot higher than 1M in 3 mins since you're going to be down people.
---
Item rack has the ability to be macro'd with WoW's macros. Use:   
---
 /itemrack equip setname 
---
just make that your very own button and drop it wherever on your action bars.
---
You can see that man is a real pro, he has an extra function key
---
We're still at a point where hitting 60 means playing an average of ~3 hours per day since release. If you think that's casual, your life isn't very demanding and you have a decent amount of free time on your hands.
---
What's a HoT
---
Here's an idea. Don't play it? I promise you an even bigger part wants TBC over Classic, we just are waiting for our turn. Player count for TBC and WotLK went to 9-12 million. It's no secret that people prefer them over Vanilla. 
---
I hope it's put to a vote, I bet TBC will win by a majority.
---
100% agree I rolled pve maybe it was just simple logic to me, seeing 10x the population on servers before launch, seeing them say layering would be removed, kinda added up real easily, now I see people crying about something that was glaringly obvious to me and something I’d rather avoid, best part is people thinking the ganking will stop when bgs come out :)
---
Yeah, that's why I assumed the method I've seen people using wasn't exactly this, just that there's one method I know about that causes your character movement to lag out. That in mind, it's entirely possible people have figured out something similar yet more controlled. It's just way too much of a coincidence the way it's gone down multiple times and it seems to be happening more often.
---
I think that the reason for this was to allow Wpvp for leveling players while in a high stakes area with elite mobs and a hefty run back to your body that could cause respawns. 
---
I personally loved this.
---
Poor lil guy desperate for karma 😂😂😂 help him out r/classicwow
---
And yet, it's trash. If an individual dps needs to stop and drink then by all means
---
Only UI Addon I have is Bartender. I also pulled the target frame and my own frame to the upper center and moved the group frame below it. :)
---
Especially since you need his essence to make Thunderfury. It's not like you can just get the bindings and be gtg after all. That's without mentioning all his BIS for nearly forever items he drops as well.
---
Been saying this from day one of server announcement. They say they listen to us and read the forums and care about what we have to say... then only release 10 servers and act like the response to classic was a surprise to them. Clearly they pay 0 attention to the player base unless there’s enough threads about it.
---
They couldn’t find it in their “reference client.”
---
I play 24/0/27 and hell, i do top the meters. Most priests i have raided with just spam flash heal and get oom halfway through the fight and the druid and paladins keeps the raid going. Priests are way to hyped for this phase.
---
Yes, karma is exactly why I commented. I’m glad someone noticed
---
Why split the community?
---
Lol its not terrible
---
I have 400 Mbits 17 ping and the game is literally unplayable when the zones are really full.
---
Your fiber doesn't counter shit, you just haven't been to really full zones
---
Nice run.  Last night there was a group that would mind control you back further from the dungeon before killing you so they could camp longer.
---
that doesn't bring up a menu with all the trinkets in my bag (like in the image), it only lets me equip a set
---
The guild will give you one if they want you to come to BWL.
---
I will literally let alliance kill me 4-5 times sometimes because i honestly feel so bad for them (Arugal realm) because the only time they can do anything in open world is 3am-7amST and they need all the help they can get.  
---
Dumb horde groups do this shit to them and it's such a waste of free honor.
---
&gt; MC seemed stupid easily compared to 16+ years ago or whatever...I just don't ever remember downing rag that quickly until we had some MC gear amongst our DPS
---
It's tons of factors. Pre-bis lists and gold farm methods spread like wildfire with Twitch and Icyveins. Higher player skill because the game is 15 years old, better framerate and network stability so your spells never get delayed by a dropped packet, easier guild organization with Discord, etc.
---
You can post in both...
---
I’ve reported probably 8 botters and they typically go offline within a day or two and haven’t returned. One time I even misspelled the name in my email and they emailed me back to verify his name. So far they are listening to reports well imo!
---
That's because those are shitty enchants lol
---
The white ones are Icey enchants, not crusader.
---
Badlands is good, but can be very popular and a pvp nightmare.
---
Swamp of sorrows has a fair few quests around your level.  Not many people there in my experience, just people passing through heading to sunkern temple.
---
Then move up to maybe Feralas at 43/44
---
delete all of them except the highest one
---
&gt;I dont want to sacrifice my raid dps for that.
---
Does raid DPS mean anything in your guild incentive/reward wise? Generally speaking, warriors have the problem of over-dpsing what the tank can handle. So your max raid DPS doesn't matter, all that matters is you perform as well as your tank allows.
---
I'd say go for the slow swinging bursty pvp weapon. Being able to kill someone before a healing spell lands is a lot more satisfying than battling a healers mana bar.
---
Where you got those numbers from?
---
afaik it's top 3,5% to get to rank 11 eventually
---

I'm leveling my druid to be a tank and a part of me is so tempted to go balance just to try it out.
---
then give us brutality blade :)
---
Alliance PvP racials are for sure not better than horde.
---
This focuses more on finishing a run as fast as possible so you can do 4-5 boost runs per hour
---
Yea, pretty much no one wants to touch that god forsaken piece of work
---
Saw a dude giving free portals last night and just asked (didn't demand) to follow his stream
---
THANK... YOU... SO... MUCH.

Saw a player named Bigdickswang yesterday, fuck a report.

Yeah, I've known of that first method you mentioned since the beginning of online gaming. If it's being used for this, I'd imagine it's some sort of Windows script and hotkey that you can fire off killing and re-enabling your internet connection. There's no way the guys I've seen doing this are physically pulling an ethernet cable in and out while running in circles trying to bait me out of stealth and screw my opener up by obfuscating their position on my screen via lag.
---
Bonereaver's is ridiculously good in PVP and realistically should only go to someone using it for hardcore PVP ranking. That being said, I believe Deep Woods + Flurry Axe will outdps it in PVE. There really isn't much crossover between PVP and PVE for warriors. Gear for what is more important for you.
---
I totally agree with you, players targeting items from an instance and asking you to help for literally free, thats just greedy. Some of the items could even be bought on the ah, meaning they are saving money for it, without op getting anything. Time aint free
---
Buddy, everyone here thinks you’re the salty noob.
---
which pvp server ISNT unbalanced for ally though lmao. but i picked an unbalanced pvp server, choosing the stacked faction ofcourse, rushed to 60, and group up and camp flight points... cant i just cry on Reddit about how this is "real pvp" and anyone who doesnt like it should just quit? :sadface.
---
Yes I was ranked top the week before, often happened there would be a week with no new HW. 
---
Thankfully on our server on horde side, we had an agreement the new HW would “slack” the week they earned it so it was easier and quicker for the next person going for it. 
---
FYI, everyone on that screenshot ended up earning Rank 14 - High Warlord before it stopped going into TBC. 
---
Gashrak, Shi and Damag from that list were former HWs.
---
&gt;I'm an ele/resto hybrid. I have a lot of pvp related spells that need to be on close keys, so I get deep into modifiers.
---
Have you considered using an action bar layout saving addon to swap between pvp action bars and healing action bars as needed?
---
I use [myslot](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/myslot) for this. Got an "ele" action bar profile for pvp situations and a "resto" action bar profile for pve.
---
If you thought faction balance was bad now, wait for tbc lol
---
My server goes between medium and low and I’m horde on one of the few alliance dominated servers.  Dominated is a strong word.  Probably like 60-40 
---
I love it.  We give them hell.  A lot of us have gotten to know each other because it’s usually about 20-25 of us grouping up to fight them.  Eventually, they will call in the giant blob of 40+ alliance and they roll over us.  When this happens, we don’t keep pushing 20 vs 40.  That’s stupid.  We break into smaller PvP groups and go gank other hotspots.   Probably better honor this way anyway.  
---
Eventually they get group up and fight back, then we group back up and the cycle continues. 
---
I enjoy it.  I like it a lot better than the 40 vs 40 laggy fights.
---
Just shrink item rack to the right size and put it over an empty gap on your action bars
---
Then why did you roll a PvP server?
---
Yeah, I was thinking this too but it'd be pretty rough for them to PVP at a solid level with no add-ons. Definitely possible though.
---
He isnt charging from their pockets tho, he is just turning it into a win/win
---
My wife got Finkle's Skinner on her very first UBRS run, outrolled five other people for it in a pug. She skinned Pristine Hide of the Beast on her second UBRS run ever and sold it for enough to get her epic mount.
---
Farm yourself some Jungle remedies from the Kurzen casters in Stranglethorn for poisons and diseases: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2633/jungle-remedy
---
What server are you on though? How many big world pvp fights have you been involved in? It's mostly a problem on big servers like Gehennas/Shazzrah/Herod during the 80v80 or bigger fights.
---
my body is ready
---
tbh I'd put 10d at the 'meandering around, leveling professions, RPing and bankstanding all day' level.
---
If you are focused on leveling, I'd put it at closer to 8d as an average time.
---
Once set up can this wake the pc up while it's in sleep mode?
---
That would be so nice if it would work this way I don't wanna have my computer on all the time.
---
Evasions always worth it so you don't get MS or Hamstringed I'd say.
---
Yep. Five Mana Igniting Cords but only one ring of spellpower.
---
How dare u speak of alliance out numbering you, only alliance are allowed to complain about that
---
Playing a Rogue the only answer is to be Horde, because fuck going against Orcs!
---
Other than that probably just bleed kiting, and depends what spec they are. If they're fury you can evasion to avoid hamstring, but if they're arms Overpower is gonna hurt. But then again so are auto attacks and mortal strike and being able to get out of melee range is probably more beneficial imo.
---
The uniformity of the physiques in this game are probably my biggest pet peeve. It'd be good if you started off scrawny and got more ripped as you leveled. It's also kind of off that warlocks and warriors would have the exact same physiques
---
You can always say no or your busy/can't if you don't feel like helping
---
Wouldn't the fact they're wearing leather actually make an argument in favour of cheap shot or ambush?  Garrote is bleed damage which ignores armour, so you'd surely prefer that against more, not less, heavily armoured foes?
---
Can we just take a moment to appreciate this? An actual 1 on 1 fight on a PvP server. This right here is what the people on those servers deserved, but sadly not what they got.
---
hello kitty is more up your ally scooter. Got all the UI helpers for people dependent on addons to find success in a 15 yr old game. Derp.
---
I have the staff, sure I lose out on an offhand with even more +SP but  at the perk is you only don't have to then go out and grind the drakestone which is tons of RNG (RNG 1: Orb drops @ 10%, RNG 2: Orb has right stats 1/15 chance)
---
I agree, as someone that only got to 50 before phase 2 I can't really play the game.  I guess it's my fault for playing on a pvp server but it's just not fun at all.
---
How good is this armor? for a casual player farming gold maybe some pvp? I love how it looks :-)
---
rank 4 first week and rank 6 second week is possible, have multiple people in my guild on gehennas doing it as we speak, tho we are the top guild on horde but still.
---
The true classic experience.
---
They're like cankles of the wrist.
---
Boytoys of lordaeran eh? When do y’all raid? I’m interested.
---
The system is like a few loot items after more than 3 months, right? Unless I'm missing something, the reward is that and like 5k karma from showing it off on Reddit. Like as far as I can tell (new to this) is the honor not a flat point thing its relative to everyone else so if everyone chilled out a little it would still be the same just with less disruption to everyone else? 
---
As far as I can tell, it's another case of "this is why we can't have nice things." Would love to find out more though, it's a weird kinda system so if someone could explain it it would be great.
---
There was a pally on my server that botted all the way to 60, pretty sure he still has yet to be banned.
---
These bots are so obvious it’s ridiculous that blizzard doesn’t even take a second to look at what they are doing. The paladin would cast a low rank of flash of light after every weapon swing.
---
This. My guild pulls insane dps, but since tanks get loot prio + are good players it never ever gets messy. In pugs though.. Whole different story
---
As other commenters have said, wave banning is common. This is probably down to Blizzard’s need to learn about how a newer bot may work, studying behaviours etc. to ensure they can catch these guys more efficiently in future.
---
It’s simple really.
---
Orc fury here too. Had AotDW and Serathil, now have and use Spinal Reaper.
---
Dps wise you can do loads with DW or 2H, the difference is DW gets rage generating more consistently and isn’t dependant on windfury procs. DW also scales better as the game goes on.
---
The real question is, do you want to do much PvP? If yes, then you’re going to have to take whatever non vendorstike/Earthshaker you can get. OEB, Spinal and BRE all do well. You’ll do great PvE damage and spank in PvP when respeccing arms. 
---
If you’re planning on doing mostly PvE, then you want 2x Deathbringer, or Deathbringer and Corehound Tooth and just picking up an Earthshaker when it’s free for whenever you go PvP.
---
Stop playing then
---
I mean this obviously isn't viable gameplay, but in general rolling alliance on a pvp server was almost always going to get you a lopsided population not in your favor, right?
---
I actually had my best world PvP experiences in TBC, and yes I did play vanilla in the day.  Flying might get cited as many to be the death of world PvP, but it really couldn't be further from the truth.  It facilitated it by enabling people like myself to find fights more efficiently, and I had many battles.
---
raids were mostly nerfed before the casuals guilds were completing them as I said so except for the best progress guilds very few people experienced the pre nerfs versions.
---
Nerfs of dungeons are mostly to make them less anoying, not harder, usually less amount of trash and less punishing respawns but ti's not harder just more anoying.
---
Classes changes are overated except feral druids other classes didn't get buffed that much and they actually nerfed some itemization such as tanks items, a lot of tank items were heavily nerfed mid vanilla,  defense was a stacking was a lot easier than in classic.(they reduced all defense of tier 1 and dungeon items by like 25%)
---
People somehow believe that people who play one PvE servers are not interested in PvP, which is not true at all, since big wPvP battles still happen there, they just don't like being griefed.
---
yeah no shot, what happened to No Changes?
---
wait...for days???? wtf haha does the decay timer bug out if its kited into a dif zone?
---
Yeah, the idea is that rogues already have a high dodge chance so you will dodge and get overpowered, might as well dodge the rest of the swings.
---
It's pretty simple to me. If they camp your corpse and you have zero chance, log off and play with your alter, let them waste more time. I will never let any Alliance farm me.
---
yeah could do, it just seems like such a logical thing to have them on the default actionbars instead of their own menu v. frustrating
---
Now kite King mosh plz
---
I've been into an east trying to get uncontested dreamfoil. Everywhere else is a shitshow.
---
Please join, in alliance on Heartseeker and we have definitely seen an influx of people on horde. Honestly being on the alliance side, these guys complain that the server is imbalanced but they never want to PVP. Anytime there is PVP around horde usually smash our small groups until a bunch of reinforcements come. It’s a very good server, I like the horde because they seem to be very feisty and they don’t give up. I definitely think the server will balance out more with the horde only transfers. PLEASE if you are considering it bring as many people as you can. Horde need the numbers but it’s honestly not super bad.
---
1. I didn't downvote you
---
2. I already have my wand
---
3. Maybe they're downvoting you because you're acting like a pompous ass?
---
Do you actually have 9% hit or is that including your racial? No reasons to have 9%+the orc racial. Also for orc, Bone Slicing Hatchet would be better than MS. 
---
As far as which weapon you should go is entirely up to you. The difference between a spinal reaper/BRE warrior and a desthbringer/bone slicer warrior is only about 5% if played right by both. 5% damage is not a very large amount and you could see 2Hs drop before a deathbringer since there are 3 chances for them. Also there is generally more competition for the 1H. Every guild really should go through and talk to each warrior/rogue beforehand and ask them if they desire to go 2H/DW or Sword/dagger so that those people get the gear for the spec they want to play.
---
Anyway, the fact that you wanna pvp tells me you should just be 2h fury dps for raids and then you get to pvp as arms without sucking up the gear from others.
---
The only problem I have are with the ones exploiting at flight paths to monopolize honor. That shit is lame.
---
I honestly have no fucking clue what you are doing with your life if that's how you world pvp.
---
I only ever see rank and ranks 3's doing it too. It's the strangest thing. Like why are you exploiting when you're not even beating the average player in terms of honor farming?
---
Well done, I was waiting for such a feature for a while!
---
To be fair vanilla was so long ago that 99% of the time, people remember wrong even though they think they're right.  Not saying this to be mean, just stating the truth.  We humans are weird in how we convince ourselves we're right when when we're not.
---
Sorry i didn't want to insult you. But you will notice a significant difference when the majority of your raid runs with optimal gear. And when everyone buffs himself to the tooth MC is a real piece of cake. You're only limited to how fast you can pull trash due to mana and how fast you organise boss fights. There are excellent tools out there to make it fast. Exorsus Raid Tools for example. If everyone keeps their mouth shut and concentrates on the game you keep wipes on a low number to zero. It's hard for many people to be disciplined though.
---
it's been explained many times that a moonkin's damage is NOT the reason why they are in the speedrun clears, it is because of MotW and resto druids are useless with the buff limit for applying hots to tanks when you stack buffs for speed clears.
---
Because most pve servers are dead or will be dead.
---
All the better pve raiders play on pvp servers for some reason.
---
Watching these videos is sad, but it makes me wonder why more people don't go through the burning steppes entrance. Do horde camp there too?
---
the only real world pvp on a large scale i've had so far is when fighting over world bosses. battlegrounds can't possibly change that, so it's all the same to me
---
Yo stop running like that. Strafe. If you open up your back, you’re asking for bigger hits. Others commented really nice comments too. Otherwise nice bro :)
---
With the 8/11/32 build? I'm kind of weary of losing the nature's grace/moonfire crits from my moonglow build (here's my current build: ) if I switch. Is gaining feral charge worth it for pvp?  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/01405030025013--505203105015](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/01405030025013--505203105015)
---
While I understand your frustration with P2, it can be a joke at times, you didn't have to join a pvp server, joining a pve server would have gave you the freedom to do both and feel safe when you didn't want to pvp, just saying.
---
thank you for your reply, think ill do a 2h, and do DW in later phases
---
And the reason to bring one is fearie fire. In a speed run a resto druid isn’t useful because druids don’t have fast heal to spam. And even though a feral tank might otherwise be good, feral fearie fire has too long a cd to be spammed quick enough. So they took a crit aura with their fearie fire.
---
This is a fallacy.  There's enough people playing classic that even if you split it's population three more ways, there'd still be plenty enough players left over to fully populate a server of each type.
---
Furthermore, it would be illogical to assume that populations of other expansions would be comprised of 100% existing classic players.  There will be people returning to other expansions who have no interest in vanilla classic.  These people will constitute "new" players to the classic games.  Take me for example, I'm waiting for TBC.  I don't have interest in vanilla so I'm not playing right now.  I'd be a newcomer if they did TBC.
---
our tanks gold threat pretty well, dont think I overaggrod a boss once
---
Well he’s not wrong. It’s toxic for certain individuals depending on situation, and joyful for others. But probably much fewer are truly enjoying as those ganking are probably do it simply to farm honor not for fun. no one enjoys stomp pvping after about 2 hrs of it; it’s just the necessary evil at the moment. I have noticed most people below level 50 haven’t changed much. I fight at those levels as often as pre phase 2.
---
I've never been there without 2-3 groups running it constantly. Its unique and we already have a troll dungeon. Hinterlands would be much worse with a dungeon there instead of an awesome open world playground.
---
&gt;...a potentially costly project...
---
A highschool student could complete this project in a week if they had access to the data. Let's not act like this is some huge undertaking, it's just posting some data to a web page. 🙄
---
I loved world pvp but like..... Horde just roams around with death squads. I don't even get to enjoy pvping. I find groups sometimes but even  with 4-5 people, most horde groups are more than that.
---
Concern trollers are garbage. If you don't have anything useful to say then STFU. 
---
:)
---
The discussion here is spellpower scaling, period. I'm not interested in debating you on fight lengths or whether you personally go oom in Phase 1. There will be longer fights later which challenge mage's mana pool and regen capabilities. 
---
But even with infinite mana, warlocks with 2 debuff slots will pull ahead of mage dps once they get their grubby little hands on enough spell hit gear to match what mages have access to through gear and talents.
---
You're going to get smoked by warlocks in ZG and AQ unless you are lucky enough to be the one mage that benefits from the rolling ignite bug.
---
The players who are in the top 10ish spots definitely just....yeah. I know a number of the top spots on both factions on my server are account sharing from their own words. It's just not possible to lead a healthy lifestyle and go for top spots. Which is fine to me personally, if people want to take some time off other parts of their life to do that.
---
Anecdotally some of the higher historically arena ranked players in my guild are the higher ranks among the rankers. On the other hand, there are other historically high ranked players (one multi glad, one multi R1) who are like scout and grunt respectively haha
---
Well I’m sitting in a postpartum room in the hospital thinking about the honor I’m missing out on 😂
---
No, because I have communicated my desired schedule ahead of time and she communicates her desired schedule ahead of time. Communication is key as in anything else with a relationship.
---
Seems to work, thanks!!
---
If you actually think after going through all this effort they'd just overwrite vanilla classic servers with TBC...  
---
They won't.
---
Yeah I'm a druid thankfully so just teleport moonglade and fly. Menethil Harbor and Boats have been camped 24/7 by Horde since P2.
---
Another option is to go with a raid but well.. easier said than done unless doing Onyxia :)
---
Testing the waters with this post. Trying to convince 4-5 friends to come with me. Thanks for your reply!
---
And why the fuck don’t the NPCs there attack horde on sight?? Camps should have guards it’s ridiculous horde can just stand there literally on top of the NPCs waiting for people to land from a gryphon and immediately tagging anyone who rez’s so they can’t leave.
---
All I know is myself and many others would have spy pick players up before we could see them. Whether this was due to render lag or some other factor is kind of irrelevant.
---
I understand what the render range is supposed to be. What I'm saying is that for whatever reason this was frequently not the case for myself and others in this thread.
---
So if lag or whatever is causing rendering to be delayed is making my effective render range to be ~80 yards; but spy can't detect up to 100yds then to me it seems like spy has picked up the enemy before they have rendered for me. Which is really is all that matters. How it appears to the player.
---
Hence the whole part of asking and not demanding.
---
How much difference dps wise is it between 2 handed slam fury and 2 one handers fury when it comes to pve raid dps? I have a 2 hander and am currently arms spec but would like to respec to fury for BWL.
---
Evasion is just free overpower and then you can try to ms or other single target ability, if miss nothing happens if hit thats a gg.
---
Seasonal servers are not a stretch. Rolling out new servers every 18 months or two years is a definite possibility. Seasons are something that has worked well for other games. Wow classic can be one of those too
---
With us we take about 20 of us and go ham. Last eye it took longer to fly there than get it.
---
Yeah for sure, I’m just saying you may as well do pop bleeds if you’re going to try hamstring kite. You don’t do any damage if your kiting unless you’ve got a bleed up. And just poking into melee range every 3-5 seconds is actually beneficial to warriors as we don’t actually hit you in that window anyway.
---
I know that, I only mentioned I have enough gear for +9, since im talking about potentially using a sword.. thanks for a super unhelpful comment
---
Just dinged 50 on my warrior. Is their any gear that ‘Reduces intercept CD by 5 seconds’ I can get that isn’t a PvP reward? Haven’t been pvping a ton cus &lt;60 and also warrior, maybe have 50 HKs at the moment.
---
If I do have to PvP to get Intercept CD gear, what rank do I need and/or am I too late? New to WoW and mainly started for the PvP aspect but want to get some decent gear first.
---
You know there's macros for marking too right? 
---
/tm 1
---
/tm 6
---
Etc.
---
They still resist 25% of the time, and while you get the combo points no matter what the extra damage of garrote is usually enough to clean them up.
---
Mostly FF or they'd likely take a feral as they are melee heavy but in general yes.
---
If you are ganking raids that could work but the first plate wearer warr will just piss in your mouth after you garrote him
---
It's an extremely vocal minority. Playing on multiple servers I can tell you the general consensus is for TBC. Nobody wants to let current Blizzard try their hand at "improving" Classic.
---
Dont click your bars 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; improving healing's gear only really makes the healers job easier.
---
Healer gear is better compared to breakpoints and fixing mistakes.  You have to improve your gear to keep up with higher tiers of content that put out more damage.
---
In addition improving healer gear can cover for mistakes and poor play from other parts of the raid.  If the healer can heal an encounter with none of the raid taking any extra damage but ends at 0 mana that's fine... as long as no one makes a mistake and takes extra damage.
---
It does more than makes the healer's job easier, it lets the healer do more jobs.  Saving a DPS who stood in fire is a boost to the groups DPS, having extra mana and throughput to be able to do that without letting your other assignment suffer is a benefit to the raid.
---
Similarly improving DPS gear makes the healer's jobs easier (as long as they don't pull aggro) by making the encounter shorter.  Shorter encounters require less heals.
---
I think it's clear tanks should still have priority because DPS is capped by their threat (and lower DPS cap means longer fights means healers need to be better geared) but that doesn't mean upgrades to DPS and healers don't benefit everyone else, beyond just making things easier.
---
Ahh i forgot about FF, yea that's also a good reason for a minimum 1 druid if you wanted to MotW buff people outside of raid.
---
Tbc without flying is like food without seasoning.
---
Flying isn't this huge game destroying demon people think it is.
---
At the end of the day, flying is a core aspect that TBC fans enjoy.  If you don't like flying, don't play legacy TBC servers is we get them.  But don't go forcing your vanilla views on those of us eagerly awaiting TBC.
---
That’s my plan.
---
After the DW guys pick up their deathbringers I’ll pick one up too. But for now it’s just a wait for others to get their 2Hs so I can then roll on BRE for pvp.
---
lol
---
Ranked top 10 in pvp on my server. No addons.  
---
Cleared MC and ONY without addons as MT, bitches on farm.  
---
If you are dependent on a tool from outside the game, and I'm not, guess you are the noob. period.  
---
space space enter I need four lines to be as cool as this nob.
---
This is a huge issue. You should be able to safely land in a camp without worrying about 20 enemies camping the flight path. Because once you die you can’t even leave because they spam dots with tab targeting to get you in combat so you can’t fly out and leave again. Keeping you literally stuck and unable to play the game at all. There should be guards that are aggressive as fuck with quick respawn times.
---
Still gotta get there
---
Eh, I honestly had no idea how bad it would be. Didn't really lend it much thought. 
---
But I really, really enjoyed having the levelling experience with PVP on. It made the world so much more interesting.
---
World PVP is hella fun pre-60 in my opinion. Honestly, if you asked me again? I'd still choose a PVP Server. The 1-60 Journey has been the best part of classic for me.  Also, when BGs come out the world won't be the most efficient place to farm honor and I IMAGINE it will die down a lot.
---
Well yes and no. The unit frame doesn't look anything like so when you first launch it. But it's similar. I guess it's default if using for Retail and need some settings or something to make it look like so in classic. Still trying to figure it out.
---
You're right, this is not vanilla like.  During vanilla, the faction balance was skewed heavily for the Alliance because the horde wasn't "known" as the best PvP faction yet.  So the massive gank squads were Allies killing horde players - which is maybe why you're unfamiliar with the situation.  
---
There's no need to be ugly here - calling me a liar.  I played 15 years ago during vanilla and was mercilessly camped and flattened by alliance gank squads on Dragonmaw.  To your point though, server populations this time around are absolutely one-sided, and unfair (more so than vanilla).  Blizzard absolutely botched the launch - you'll get no argument from me.  
---
However, human beings playing PvP modes of MMO's are not known for being kind and benevolent.  The exact opposite is true, players are known to be merciless and extremely petty in internet games.  But even if the factions *were* balanced you'd still get flattened in unfair PvP encounters.  The current state of PvP was an easily predictable outcome, and it is why I chose to play on a PvE server, and it is why I don't feel sorry for you.
---
You want to know the bridge is damaged before you get there, so you can make preparations.
---
Fuck yeah Atiesh.
---
War mode in retail is here to stay, and it can be totally lit! I was looking to complete the weekly Call to Arms a couple days ago, and I found a massive bloodbath happening between the Ally/Horde bases in Nazjatar. Ended up with hundreds of honorable kills! It was a blast. :D
---
Uhm we can see this mages portrait and he’s not fully pre raid bis. So. I mean.
---
16/0/35 is also an option, doesn't have charge but personally I just feel awkward without extra range on moonfire.
---
The ever evolving story
---
How much xp does a level 40 typically get from this?
---
&gt;Eh, I honestly had no idea how bad it would be. Didn't really lend it much thought.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;But I really, really enjoyed having the levelling experience with PVP on. It made the world so much more interesting.

---
Just copying my response to /u/MongooseOne
---
Its not so much the amount of time required, but my inability to commit to a raiding guild's schedule. I would have to miss many nights and I assume its hard to secure a spot like that.
---
A guild tank could spend 24/7 of his life doing gear runs for guildies.  It's not a reasonable expectation to do that. 
---
Even in a guild I think it's fair to ask for something in return.  Had a guild run and our tank ended up with a 10g repair bill, we looted out three other guildies who were in junk gear at 57-60 and weren't in core raid group or even with the guild that long or super involved. I got nothing out of the run either since I lost a couple rolls on skin of shadow (literally needed just one, other guy got two, third guy got one).  I at least gave our tank the vendor money I got from the greed vendor drops I got. The other guildies didn't even stick around for second run, they just all dropped and left. 
---
If there's a core raider who is otherwise putting in effort I could see it being optional to help them out with a particularly hard-to-pug run, but beyond that, no, even inside a guild its reasonable for your tank to get something out of the run.
---
I guess you're incapable of basic logic and reasoning, because otherwise you'd realize that even the slightest imbalance in a queue based on a single server would mean that the faction with lower pop gets insta queues, and that the higher pop faction gets long queues.
---
That might be too hard for you though, since you prefer to base your arguments on feelings rather than facts and data.
---
As the guy above said garrote actually does more effective damage against plate wearers.
---
Must be hard with two days of job lul
---
I really enjoy these but I need to call you out on something you said. So first off I’m on Deviant delight which is a rp pvp server with an ally imbalance. So maybe my opinions are skewed. 
---
However you made the broad claim that “this is why the horde rolled here”
---
I wanted to call that out because for one, isn’t it possible that a bunch of them were simply on the server from the start and it has now gotten imbalanced, and there is legitimately no other way to get honor other then going to the hot spot that is BRM?
---
I’m not saying this to be nasty or prove you wrong I am genuinely curious if I’m wrong and you are right that most of the horde rolled the server after the imbalance. 
---
The second part of that question is, isn’t it harder for the horde to rank up with honor on a server they dominate? So wouldn’t as a horde or ally who wanted rank 14 you would want to, at best, be on a server where the other side has slightly more players?
---
Also the imbalance on my server is like 55 45 I think maybe based off things I have seen, because sometimes our guys own the mountain sometimes the other guys do, would be so lame if it was just always my guys or the other guys :( I Hope Bliz helps you guys out a little!
---
Meh, only one of us is being downvoted but I’m sure in the dumb one 😂 I’m amazed people think 7 spellpower for 3 weeks is worth hours of their life. Just hours and hours.
---
I have a 60 Paladin that has enough gear to gold farm. I just don't really want to pvp on him.
---
I don’t know how costly it is but any positive number is larger than zero and zero is the benefit that I see from leaderboards.
---
The fact that it worked says a lot about the type of people corpse camping.
---
&gt;follow his stream
---
Why would you want to watch a guy give away free portals all day!
---
Corpses despawn after a while, dont they?
---
Paladin officer got it over a mage. Paladin officer. Good guild
---
That undead is gnarly.
---
Yeah... ok... that was cool.
---
whats hard about it?
---
I guess it depends on the Server. I think some people are actually botting since there are 2 people *almost* on the clock online selling portals and water in Kargath. Seriously. Every time I HS to Kargath both are there. Today at 6 AM I arrived in Kargath with my alt and they were still there. Few minutes ago I HS on my main to go to MC for the raid and they were still there.
---
I don't want to accuse them since *technically* I am online at the same time as well and maybe they log off when i'm not looking. But other people in my Guild have also noticed those.
---
10-19 hunter or priest
---
20-29 hunter
---
30-39 hunter or mage
---
40-49 shaman
---
50-59 warrior
---
And what spec did you go if you don't mind me asking?
---
dont work that way since cross realm BGs have been confirmed
---
You are really being intentionally dense here aren't you. This mechanic only penalizes people that have multiple characters on a single account vs using multiple accounts. It adds an arbitrary restriction where there doesn't need to be one.
---
Their iceblock removes any stun/ disable or blind and they can use it at least twice in one fight. Same with frost nova. Same with blink. They have so many options to move away from a melee class or root them. If you lose against a melee class as a mage you have to actually be blind and a double amputee or absolutely dogshit at the game. That's why mage is so incredibly easy.
---
Print screen bro...
---
Most people assume they'll do TBC/WotLK and stop before Cata if they don't do classic+. The problem being classic+ players might tolerate TBC, but definitely don't want WotLK and would rather new development start from classic rather than from TBC.
---
In my experience that is.
---
Sounds like blauxmeau. Even when theyre in groups of 10-30 if they get wiped once they all hearth home
---
Maybe the stream focuses more on the person's commentary than gameplay.
---
I haven't found a solid answer....I have 3 orbs at the moment. What do I do with them? I know they are for crafting but other than that just sell on ah?
---
Seperate servers for expansions would be the only viable way to do it imho.
---
Yeah well like I said, I've never seen this kind of stuff happen, so there's no point in arguing until someone has proof, and nobody can get proof anymore so there's nothing to argue about.
---
30% of the time*
---
25% + base 5% right? Makes it even more op.
---
A single dps taking a couple seconds to drink every couple trash pulls is not going to noticably slow a raid down. If you're that concerned about time I hope nobody is allowed to go afk for any reason for any amount of time because someone going to take a piss or deal with their kid is going to waste more time than a boomkin drinking
---
Agreed! If TBC comes out I'll do the same thing this time that I did the first time around.. just quit completely. 
---
Some of us just want to play vanilla, forever. Maybe classic+. I have no interest in content past that.
---
TAS is about patterns. If you know that something should be done right now for the win, and TAS doesn't do it more than a minute and even managed to fail because of it, this pattern should be fixed.  The path of criticism was chosen this time.
---
Lets you drink, denies warrior charges, denies mage openers, lets you ambush people... For smart pvp players it is the best racial.
---
The horde on this sub seem to think they won’t be getting a queue, it’s funny tbh.
---
Being Alli on Gandling, i gotta agree. Interesting to see it from the other perspective
---
Blizzard could have attempted to alleviate it.  They weren't forced to fuck it all up.
---
Typically if my guildies are farming something, like HOJ for example, and we put together a few hour grind to get it, whoever is aiming for HOJ will pass on all other loot.
---
This is kinda default courtesy, you want people to help you do something, you offer them something in return.
---
We usually 3-4 man HOJ runs, one person passing on all loot turns it into a fun little ~20-25g/hour grind for me as a lock while helping out a guildie.
---
[deleted]
---
A lot of people in this thread think his hours weren’t a waste. I’ve pointed out you can accomplish much more and that time and was actually called the stupidest person alive in this thread :)
---
When you're in full raid gear, you will if you try to absolutely minmax your DPS.
---
Dont help guildies xD
---
I farm lashers as a means to level, it’s a pain to get inside DM but once I’m in then I’m safe to do a few runs to level up while making a good return in gold.    
---
Sticking in the realm as I’ve still got one RL buddy that plays there too, if anyone has any experience where a 48 hunter could solo dungeon then I’d be interested in hearing them.    
---
What motivates me, I’ve rerolled a rogue with said friend and we’re both looking forward for some eventual revenge.
---
What do you even do with honor in retail?
---
It's taxi lock who was summoned there himself.
---
He linked it before, it’s a weak aura
---
I use a simple macro that announces who I innervate. It is useful to all the other druids in the raid so we don't accidentally innervate the same target.
---
I think it’s funny you think I’m referencing you, good luck amberlamps.
---
Plenty of room just be creative
---
I have MIK scrolling combat text or whatever its called. 
---
It gives me names attatched to numbers every time I get healed. I made sure to thank a healer every time they saved me in a raid.
---
It’s an average farm for both of them. There are much spots for both. Very few rich thorium in azshara and dreamfoil shares spawns with sun grass there which dramatically decreases the income you can get. It’s ok but it’s not great. Average.
---
The problem is at what expansion do you stop and what about the people who dont want to move on to the next?
---
You get ported to where you queue up. So there's always a travel time to get back to wpvping, but yes the world pvp won't stop, but it will be signficiantly lowered due to players spending a large majority of their time inside the BG's or on the FP to the pvp zone. Also most zones will be safe from ganking. Searing gorge, burning steppes and felwood seems to be the worst zones, the rest should be quite safe.
---
Blizzard didn't interfere with your faction choices then, they didn't now.
---
You sound very petty lol.
---
Isle of Quel’danas was one of the best periods in all of wow’s history
---
This is bannable. The player might be lucky and only get a warning, but if you report him with a timestamp of when it happened, then he will get contacted by a gm/banned.
---
I honestly rolled a char on an RP server hoping it was better and it was a little better but I'm surprised how many names that were clear puns and references to stuff were still around.
---
And ya, I get a lot of people think there funny but tbh I've just never been a fan of puns in general. It's just not my type of humor and that's fine because I understand it is the majority of players type of humor.
---
Love
---
New player, casual: 12days played.
---
Non-new player, casual: 10days played.
---
Non-new player, know what you're doing in Classic: 8days played
---
The best speed runners do it in about 4-5 days played. The slowest casual players do it in about 14 days played. The average is about 9-11 days played depending on how much you stand around or if you have rested xp, what class you play, the time of day you play, etc. Doing professions adds probably a whole day of play time to max.
---
Nope. He said 10g an hour bc of lockouts
---
Quick question: I've seen some people dissapear before. Are they logging out or exiting?
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e02sj3/macro_giveaway_evening/
---
I saw this nice guy the other day! Don’t know if he’s still available since this is a day or so old but worth a shot to ask him.
---
Sell them on the AH.
---
Hahahahahahahaha, you think bgs will solve the raids sitting on gy's and people being instagibbed when flying in when they still have the honorless target debuff. 
---
This is them attempting to grief others, not farm honor. P2 was merely a thinly veiled excuse.
---
Wowhead lists 45 RTV nodes, the downside is a lot of them are in the sea.
---
&gt;and now I'm going to try opening portals first and direct whisper everyone in this city.
---
You forgot rogue
---
Nope, not at the zone border. Today it was smack dab in the middle of Felwood.
---
I wish I could fly away from the people ganking me :(
---
TBC had so many QoL fixes and made other specs actually viable (feral druid). Plus flying mounts are fun. The idea of heroics was awesome too. Collecting the badges to turn in for gear was a great concept because even if you didn't get any drops from bosses you still got rep/badges, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.
---
That’s true actually. It can be ok for mining with waterwalking
---
i'm on one of the most full servers and I also haven't experienced this unplayable lag.
---
Nah brah it's really bad. I just got this. It stands around way too long doing nothing. It even stands around if i summon it while in combat. ALSO it has 470 hp, if anyone farts on it, it dies or heals itself.
---
You misspelled seconds
---
Asmon has the funniest take I’ve ever heard in drama shit lmao. 
---
“Yeah I did that shit, I’ll do it again!”
---
You're actually absolutely right. There is no proxy right now for judging 'going hard' right now. So I used the next best thing. Two weeks of HonorSpy scrapes right now across two factions on one server, putting in data points of the median points (as of Friday this week anyway, haven't crunched Sat data) in each bracket shows about 'equal' difficulties, as you proposed, at brackets 12-14. These are people pushing the limits of Honour/Hour. Equivalence suggests that yes, they are relatively even and the proportions (1.5x people competing vs 1x) is working out. 
---
Once it hits bracket 11, the curves suddenly plateau out. The sheer pool size for the dominant faction is actually sinking the median by as many as 16k honor points as you go down the brackets. And that was for the 5 day honor week - it'll widen with a 7 day cycle.  Say 22k difference per bracket once you extrapolate that. That's approaching 100% of a point difference as you hit brackets 6-7,far exceeding the match of 50% (population delta) you would expect. 
---
Again honor points is a whole can of worms as there are so many factors determining this. Honour split more ways? More horde to theoretically kill? Absolute dominance in zones so no kills? Parties capped at 5? Raid capped at 40? It remains the only proxy we have however, and it scales with time and has a soft cap tied in with cooldowns for some classes (can a horde rogue vanish less or more than an Alliance rogue?), and number of hours in a day. 
---
At face level, it seems idiotic to say 'the bar is set lower' because of the percentages. Which it would be if we were dealing with a linear set of data or behaviours/performances. 
---
But when you factor in human behaviour, an absolute # of tryharders rather than percentage, the hard floor of 15 HKs to rank, limits on honour per hour, further limited by active server times.. The existence of HonorSpy itself corrupts the data and warps it further! The existence of more spots is definitely more favourable.
---
 In extreme layman's terms, data so far suggests that competition simply falls off rather hard after the initial 75-100 sweaties. I'd be happy to look at another data set to counter or corroborate this observation.
---
Yes.. I'm on Herod and haven't had this "unplayable lag"
---
I had to swim out there twice... coz I destroyed the flare gun first time
---
I have fiber too bud... It's not your internet. Big world pvp is barely playable and that's blizzards servers.
---
You mean, taking one of the most beautiful zones ever in WoW and home to ancient elf ruins and destroying it for a shitty joke meme questing hub was bad???
---
Yeah you're right, someone does.
---
Someone who works for blizzard and has the data on their workstation.  Ask them.
---
The rest is all moot guesses.
---
Look up Stoicism philosophy. Guarantee you will change for the better
---
It'll happen, we just don't know when.
---
Yeah I'm prolly that guy.
---
My friend has a 3rd account which he uses for portal and water/bread for his warrior + shaman duoboxer. I could imagine these chars stand around and everytime he can sell something, he makes a quick buck. 
---
If its a ranker, they are online a lot anyways.
---
Just another post complaining about pvp on a pvp server.
---
I agree, I think most people want either TBC or stay on Classic. I'd be fine with either of them, although I think WotLK pre-dungeon finder it's mad good.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVCXN3ycJY  
---
in this video venruki is using what looks like TrinketMenu but for his helm and offhand slots. what addon is that?
---
not sure if it's the same but if you exit the game using alt f4 your character will stand there for about 30s. you can actually test this by logging into another character quick enough, and you can see your other character still standing there in the world. kinda weird lol
---
when you log out your character disappears from the world completely when you would expect it to
---
Sapped girls cant say no!
---
Yeah, if he’s just asking it becomes an annoying advertisement.
---
He's seeing two doctors. If you read the post and his comments in here he acknowledges.
---
I totally get where you're coming from, then. Depression and mental illnesses are a serious thing, playing games doesn't solve them. The dude acknowledges that in the post, though. He also talks about seeing his doctors and other stuff in the comments here... If you're actually interested in helping people you have to actually read the stuff they have to say. Otherwise you come across judge-y at best.
---
Unlike Hunters, Warriors aren't a dime a dozen so them reserving stuff makes sense.
---
Where would that be? Something like redbubble?
---
Ehh from the looks of it this just looks like good'ol collusion(which for whatever reason is allowed in this game..), I don't see any honor trading going on?
---
Althought it certainly wouldn't surprise me, these guys are pure scum.
---
god damn stay in school
---
side note: I grabbed their attention by /yelling FREE HONG KONG near them
---
also for the purposes of this discussion, please excuse my uh... spanish inquisitor "impression." Getting too many rich thorium veins stolen from you at 3 in the morning does things to a person.
---
on some servers yes, often the FL there is camped by 2-5 people. IF its not sure you may be able to run to the Mtn but once you start trying to get inside its the same
---
You're probably on a PVE server lol.
---
Also, nothing you say can undo you being a complete fucking noob from lack of addon use.
---
It's funny people like you even try to justify it. 
---
You would be kicked so fast from any serious guild your head would spin.
---
yeah obviously 3-4 ranks past rank 7 isnt possible, rank 10 ish u can do in a month or so though.
---
is his Main hand kang?
---
They fixed the guards so it's not safespotting, he will get fucked by guards if he attacks people from there. If he doesn't get fucked, well then definitely go report him.
---
The BG's are going to be in server groups, it isn't all servers.
---
Spy doesn’t point out where people are either you mongoloid
---
You should have rolled a caster though so you could have done dungeons just wearing that!
---
just another brain dead comment that doesn't understand the classic world wasn't designed for 15k players, and it isn't pvp when one faction outnumbers the other 80/20
---
Its straight up false info that most horde rolled on this server when they found out it was horde dominated. Skeram was 1 of the 4 or 5 servers on the east coast that was announced weeks before the game actually launched. Many players (myself included) chose this server before it was even open
---
The imbalance came from the first server transfers where the alliance didn’t like being in a 60-40 or 55-45 split and ofc that made the divide grow much worse to what it is now.
---
That has more to do with horde population than anything. If the ratios where reverse we would see the exact same thing. Its not a horde or alliance thing, its a gameplay issue with the honor system. But hey, #nochanged right guy?
---
Does it involve paying real money more than other people?
---
All 10 players would get sent to the queue location.
---
Every wow-player min/maxes to a certain extent. I doubt that after three weeks of raiding you guys dont have a lot of pre-bis gear, since its not hard to aquire.
---
r/GMOpenUp
---
You could argue the same thing about classic
---
"oh we should not make classic because it will split the playerbase from retail"
---
No, that's a dumb argument.
---
Let me guess, you play a majority faction in a lopsided server? All yours to "savor" then.
---
Not me no thanks.
---
North?
---
Who cares if you can do it? Not having a threat addon as a tank makes you bad, period.
---
You can't fucking argue otherwise.
---
Keep being bad dude, I don't care. You're only making youself look like a huge fucking noob (because you are) for trying to justify not using addons.
---
it shows coordinates..
---
The same thing you're going to do when you "max out" your character in vanilla: Quit or reroll.
---
I mean, the mana issues get a lot better as classic goes on. They'll never be mages but the also won't oom in 40 seconds in AQ gear.
---
Itemrack
---
I think the juxtaposition between modern models and the classic world would look really weird, would the spell animations and graphics look different too?
---
Goddamn it that's what I was afraid of. Do I at least see a difference in glancing blows vs 60's?
---
Being unable to target characters with special characters in their name is more of an unintended advantage for the special character character than the reverse...
---
Many addons communicate between addon users. No different from having a macro that notifies your party of a stealth user or whatever.
---
Scholo minibosses. The downstairs one with 2 adds. IIRC Baron in strat UD as well.
---
Esc -&gt; Keybindings -&gt; AddOns -&gt; TrinketMenu
---
Feral Charge is definitely worth in pvp. You can use it not only as an interrupt but also as an escape. The spec is worse for farming but that is the tradeoff. Nature's grace and moonfire crits wont make much of a difference in pvp compared to Swiftmend and Feral Charge.
---
Expecting a return on guild runs is kinda assholish but you asked ahead of time about the mats to be enchanted. Not to mention the guilds wants you to farm it for a 200g recipe, something he can buy on his own. I understand farming dungeons for BIS to help players progress and contribute to raids, but this is BS. 
---
Not the asshole.
---
**Your problem is your playing alliance, delete all your characters and join horde.**
---
I think the phrase ignorance is bliss applies to you very well.
---
Yeah but, I don't want it casted on me in ogrimmar. I'd rather get it and use it when I need it.
---
I’m the minority that wants classic +. Kindof like what they did w OSRS
---
"This sucks but savor it because it won't happen again." No thanks. Just because it won't happen doesn't mean it should be appreciated.
---
Whenever I'm doing a dungeon, I get the occasional player trading me these stat scrolls instead of just casting them on me.
---
Thanks for the replies! Which of the two would you say is burstier? I like taking out being chunks of health over sustain
---
Activi$ion Blizzard
---
Who'da thunk it?
---
&gt; alliance on my 50/50 server
---
&gt;spam flash heal and get oom halfway through the fight and the druid and paladins keeps the raid going. Priests are way to hyped for this phase.
---
any decent geared priest can spam flash heal through any fight in this phase. Not quite sure of what kind of clowns you raid with.
---
Don’t think blizzard would take it seriously. They don’t punish gold buyers, mainly sellers. Also, why do you feel then need to rat out a player?
---
They are rank 4. I'd say there's a high chance they know there's no more honor to get after 4 kills... stripping's a bonus
---
It was only for AV.  You could queue as a party for WSG &amp; AB.
---
Imo if you arnt Moonglow then the best spec is HOTW NS. 0/30/21. Being able to tank or heal at the click of 1 gear switch button is pretty great. Helps for PvP too since you can heal up and hop in bear form with a viable tank spec
---
Objectively untrue. Wow you couldn't be more wrong. Please leave there game and Reddit, and do everyone a favor.
---
I honestly thought we did before for the most part. Pre bis isn’t hard to get :)
---
Yeah, but there wouldn't be mages in the raid either if you were taking classes for nothing but optimum dps. No reason to take anything but warriors.
---
No clue. Just know if I were a warlock I would want to buy that puppy in poster form and frame it and hang it!
---
If it can only proc once then it's about 20% mana savings.
---
Because it's still a lot of fun. People love to complain but the truth is if you just put a bit of effort into it you can still have a lot of fun. We are outnumbered 35/65 on our server but I still really enjoy world PvP.
---
no, tanks dont have much ways of farming. you need gold too, i see no problem for tanks getting compensated for tanking. plus it is hard to find a tank, if you say no, they have no dungeon to run. you arent their tank slave.
---
His words. He said 10g-15g an hour in the thread and he uses a wa for lockouts so I imagine he might really do 5 an hour
---
You are 110% right fuk the down votes they don't know wtf they are talking about.
---
It's not boring for me, and classic isn't a game where you're doing nothing but "fun" things all the time . For many, it's the tedious work you put into your character that makes it rewarding. If you want nothing but mindless hand holding, go back to retail. 
---
Or just bitch and stop playing. I was just trying to give advice on how to overcome his painpoint. If he doesn't want to do what I suggested, find another way or quit.
---
I had no idea. I played vanilla. I didn't play private servers. I wasn't constantly reading about wow. I just picked up a sub for nostalgia and fell in love again. I always played a PvP server though in vanilla and it's was never ever like this and I played on a high pop server.
---
Make your own group. LFM Uldaman Need x,y,z
---
Trade chat, LookingForGroup, World
---
I put together an Uld group in 15 min the other day.  Spamming LFG Ulda will not work very well imo
---
The gap between the best class and others narrows a lot when you get into the higher level brackets, with most classes being pretty equal 30-39+ 
---
- 10-19 hunter
---
- 20-29 hunter
---
- 30-39 warlock
---
- 40-49 priest
---
but  he said surely not shirley. im just continuing this whole misunderstanding humor stuff pls dont get mad at me
---
If spy addon and botting is tolerated then I doubt this will raise an eyebrow
---
Don’t go forcing your TBC views on those of us eagerly hoping classic stays
---
I had it.
---
I have no idea what is allowed when it comes to scripts. Some guy in my guild linked me a pickpocketing macro: 
---
&gt;/cleartarget
---
&gt;/targetenemy
---
&gt;/script SetCVar("AutoLootDefault", 1) 
---
&gt;/cast Pick Pocket
---
&gt;/in 1 /script SetCVar("AutoLootDefault", 0)
---
Is this okay to use?
---
It doesn't matter who dies. Even your tanks are doing more dps than your highest dps currently on rag once it hits 20%.
---
When levelling, I experience it in Barrenz when running RFK and RFD. I also got hit with some when levelling in STV. I do not live in the middle of nowhere, when I did comment on it, other people agreed in /1.
---
Both of us have only anecdotal evidence.
---
Oh but they do take optimal classes if they can. After all it is a speedrun, anyway to go fast. The first sets of speedruns for classic MC had tons of melee, and maybe they just didn't have a geared enough warrior to take a slot over a mage.
---
SHINE!!
---
Shaman is really good at 29.
---
Aye, but for every group that gets 4-5 to drop in one run, there is inevitably a group that gets 0. I just happen to be the unlucky bastard who is in the latter type of group more consistently than most.
---
I don't doubt the drop rate, I'm just mourning the fact that I am somehow a statistical anomaly in this case.
---
There was way less spellpower dude. People were not troglodytes 15 years ago.
---
you have 2 warriors...
---
Honestly tho the comments always stating pvp on pvp server come from people that gank lower levels.
---
Was it confirmed that BGs are going to have battlegroups at the start for cross realm queues?
---
Looks like they've just agreed not to fight each other or they are preparing for an organized 5v5. If they were honor trading they wouldnt bother rebuffing themselves...
---
What's it good for?  Druid roots, mage ice root (forget the name).  What else?
---
Hi, /u/mangoskinz

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e0lvqe/which_is_more_consistent_gold_per_hour_dmt_hunter/). 
---
You’ve collected the 4 infinity totems!
---
Nah they already know. People getting away with it for long periods of time are using a streaming service to use pixel based routines instead of directly injecting into the game. Warden scans your entire computer now so it's nearly impossible to actually bot for more than a couple weeks.
---
It'll lighten the load slightly, but it's not going to stop it, no. I was on Magtheridon from Vanilla onward, and it's one of the few servers where world PVP never died out, and while you'd get ganked a fair amount, it was -nowhere- near as much as this. There's a lot more players going to a lot more places than there ever were in vanilla. Player mentality has also changed, and over the years the whole "for the lulz" and toxic grief-ey mentality is a lot more prevalent these days, so they're much more apt to gank for gankings' sake as much as for honor farming.
---
Not familiar with the specific pvp rewards, so no idea about that. But you certainly aren't *too late*, pvp just launched a bit ago, and battlegrounds aren't even out yet.
---
I mean of the 7 endgame raids in vanilla, only 2 are out yet. There's still plenty of time.
---
No, I didn’t know this is what was coming, as this is not how vanilla was. That was the entire point. I played on pvp servers vanilla through wrath, and it was never anything like this. PvP is fun, the griefing that is currently going on is toxic.
---
I didn’t know there were even macros that *weren’t* allowed.
---
Auto pickpocket macros have been around for a while and I’ve never heard of it being a problem or against rules.
---
Yes it was confirmed in a dev interview before launch
---
There is no theorycrafting in the game. Everyone knows what to do - what items are best, what farm is best, what extensions to use, strategy for every boss etc.
---
It’s embarrassing to me that people make a “living” playing video game personally. Surely there’s much more they could be contributing to society than being paid by charity donations.
---
Very true! I was hesitant transferring from a layered server to a medium pop "dead" server. 
---
Turns out that "dad" server was actually perfectly sized. Competition for resources was where it should be, group availability was fine and faction balance was spot on. It's continued to grow in the month or so since I xferred as well, but still isn't nearly as bad as my original server. 
---
These crazy populated servers like Herod, faerilina etc. Are about as far from vanilla as I can think of.
---
Make one.
---
Caught? you are allowed to "organize" world pvp between factions. that's why there are diminishing returns on honor.
---
I laughed
---
I ditched PvP realms after playing on a trendy PvP vanilla PS, now while out in the world I focus on exploration which has increased my interest in the lore
---
Hamstring. Crippling poison. Warrior howl/rend. Curse of exhaustion. Frostbolt chill. Feral charge. Earthbound totem. Concussive shot. 
---
:).
---
Why you aren't suggesting faction-based artificial login queues, something like if there is 1000 alliance online, only 1000 horde can log and others are placed in a queue. Think about it, sounds like a good idea for your next post.
---
Movement impairing. Frost nova, blast wave, druid root, hamstring, crippling poison, all the stupid hunter abilities. Probably even for the 3 seconds of mind flay too.
---
Comparing humans who only detect stealth better, which is not guaranteed to help you in every situation, versus an ability with a cooldown that does, you pick the cooldown.

and of course, if people cared about progression on gear they should be moving lest their day becomes descent into hell
---
I'm on Westfall (US East Coast). Its kinda funny, of the 3 main tanks in my raid group, 1 of them got his Compendium in 12 jump runs, the second just got his day before yesterday after around 40 jump runs. Meanwhile I am at around 50. Maybe it'll drop, maybe it won't, but I'm not really worried about it at this point. Weapon dps is not a massive threat increase, so I'll manage. I just wish I weren't so unlucky at times.
---
ugh. awful. really really disagree with this. these were all horrible changes that led to the downfall of wow. TBC had some positives. New dungeon content was fun, class balance was fun for druids and paladins but arguably overall balance was even worse at times, people forget how unbalanced things actually were just because some hybrid classes became more than viable. I’ll still play but to me TBC was the beginning of the end for wows design philosophy. All of the amazing “old school” mmo design that came from everquest was completely gutted. Hopefully gives those of us that want it a new vanilla fresh when tbc comes out. I think the vanilla fans would still fill a few servers.
---
I've never even stepped into Duskwood.
---
Yes, dev confirmed.
---
Do you have a job?
---
Tauren Paladin...where are those? Can I make one now? /s🙄
---
Where are the walls? The picture you provided only shows you in the middle of open terrain.
---
Nothing you posted here makes sense.
---
&gt;1.12
---
Yup, unfortunately 1.12 talents and itemization.. and addons are going to make BWL quite easy as well.
---
its not really. i doubt its fun for any actual pvpers and were all waiting for bgs while this shit is just tying us over.
---
I had a 2nd account with a mage on it that just sat in kargath, on a good day i made 500g++
---
Thanks I've just never run a script before and don't understand it too well yet.
---
i perosnally havent noticed anny chain proc in one healing wave
---
enward lol
---
I only played on Excalibur BC, the balance was always favoring the horde, but form time to time they had special offers for swapping to the alliance. Plus that in terms of PvE there was cross faction play and the faction only affected pvp.
---
I walked over there. Just some weird Night Elf looking area.
---
You even got VARIMATHRAS right, smh.*
---
I had it undiscovered until about 2 days ago when I was riding around randomly, bored, while chatting on discord, and decided to fill out my map a bit.
---
Nobody will take a 43 in ZF
---
Benediction is pretty close, slight horde advantage. And alliance are more pvp organized, regularly holding FPs and towns
---
Why don't you /sit right over there.
---
You don’t have to be fast. Grenade or if you have to scatter into feint death/freezing trap macro. Plenty of time to build distance with cheetah get enough range so he can’t stun you and that’s it. Your not catching a hunter as paladin in open world vs
---
Nah probably stalagg, I heard there is only one ally left. He's one tough son of a bitch though I give him that.
---
That attitude is why you spend 5 hours a week in molten core, for the record. Our runs are 55 minutes. I'll take 4 less hours in the core because I bothered to farm better gear every day of the week.
---
you hate to see this level of bad opinion. sorry you didn’t have the chance to play vanilla at the time and joined during tbc or at the very tail end of vanilla (prove me wrong).
---
It’s again a matter of scale. WoW was for a lot of players, their first MMO. Even though min-maxing was present, it wasn’t nearly as prevalent. Classic is almost no one’s first MMO.
---
While you are able to maintain threat, the main tank is likely going to have significantly better defensive gear, and by the time Ony lands many healers are on about half mana. Unfortunately, it's just a lot easier to keep a well geared warrior up than a well geared feral.
---
I was going to try doing pendulum on my pally for 39.
---
Lol right you do... is that why the “cool” kids use to argue?
---
My guild also regularly clears MC just as fast and no, it wouldn't add up. The reason these runs go so fast is because no one dies and there is less fucking around than pugs or less organized guilds. Dps regularly sit down in our raids and moat certainly are they sitting down and drinking in yours too. One boomkin sitting and drinking every couple pulls would go unnoticed.
---
&gt;You said it's not fair because they can do significantly more in a single gcd
---
How do one person can get 5 or more nukes to land on another person? by buying a flask,pot? or farming an item?
---
 &gt;one person can press a button and 5 nukes (or more) can land on your character.
---
Classic is already developed.  The subscription fee is paying for the retail team and development.
---
Yeah but big dudes... :(
---
Lol! Got me. Sorry tho champ, all out of toys for your kids meal!
---
Flying was utter trash and murdered a huge aspect of the game. Not to mention all the other good things TBC killer (much to the joy of casuals who just want to turn tokens in and get epix).
---
I think it’s a great spec! 
---
I love my boomkin! He’s fun to raid with and dungeon with. 
---
I hate it when people are such elitists. 
---
I’m a pally tank for my guild and I get to tank all of the hardest hitting bosses in MC. It’s great. We love to play weird things and have a great time raiding.
---
The best part of boomkin is utility. He has a lot things in his belt he can do. My boyfriend plays a mage and I pally tank and we would take a boomkin anywhere. With battle res, buffs, innervate, and aura... man I love it. If healer is Oom he gots them!
---
Classes that rely on weapons for damage scale better with gear generally. Hence why rogues and warriors become very fun to play as and very un-fun to play against as time goes on.
---
Wait for phase 3 and do something useful in the meantime
---
I'm in the same situation. I don't raid, just do 5 mans when I have time. My best advice for you is to not waste money on Edgemaster's handguards. Everyone will tell you they're BiS and are equal to 3% hit but that only matters vs raid boss mobs.
---
I'll never get my 365 gold back now. Just one more thing I can't do right.
---
Add-ons?
---
But... you have a mage....
---
I would say hunter. Their pets are better at holding aggro and are also tougher. Even though lock can handle more mob at a time imho. In the end I will go with hunter for farming.
---
Limiting the distance on the combat log impacts raid logs like details on very spread out fights like Rag. We'll likely need a way to sync up data for accurate logging now.
---
I know right!
---
I hate Fucking healers too man. When their health drops they turn all pussy mode and heal themselves
---
Not sure if this is what he was going for or not, but solid attempt either way. https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/0a92f873-5dc5-4bd4-bea9-17ac82128dda_1.b201d627707ff6dcd619a762b8dc0b46.jpeg?odnHeight=450&amp;odnWidth=450&amp;odnBg=FFFFFF
---
What?
---
I have a thorium route in azshara that is 10 times better than anywhere ive ever tried to mine so far. Nobody ever there so no competition. Sure there might be less nodes compared to winterspring but its not dangerous, you dont get knocked off your mount every 2 seconds and it isnt overpopulated and mined to death.
---
&gt; But damn people are soft.
---
Imagine calling people "soft" unironically because they don't enjoy the same aspects of video games as you.
---
Even Blizzard doesnt want to spend the money developing it.  They just got a huge influx of subs to pay for retails continued development.
---
Pretty sure DMT is highest potential. Can’t really go wrong with either option but it’s worth noting that hunter will level a bit faster and you’ll save a bit of gold in Warlock mounts.
---
The very first welfare epics came in Sunwell patch.
---
Iirc there is a world boss or major event that takes place in there.. I remember having to go there for something but not what lol
---
DMT hunter then you can meet the machine elves.
---
I think he means solo AoE runs, mate.
---
I think it was sarcasm..
---
O K B O O M E R
---
Classic isn't going anywhere.   If people are willing to spend the money on subs theyll keep it alive.
---
Just add faction based queues it’s not that hard
---
Im okay with it looking kind of clashing.
---
Exactly, why the shit would Blizzard spend extra money/resources to develop something that may not even be well received, when TBC already exists and is a guaranteed win.
---
Some people live in a bubble.
---
I think you might want to consider framing things a little differently. Your objectives in game now are to farm gold. Therefore, make it a clear objective when you form up even if it’s with guildies: “I’m going to be running a dungeon for gold. Open for any dungeon, and you can roll on any item you need, but anything else we can roll greed.” 
---
You can even add additional conditions if you want “all thorium veins are reserved”, or “first righteous orb is reserved, rest will be greed rolled”. Just bear in mind to not make it entirely lopsided. 
---
I’m assuming of course that it’s the case that you actually do need to run dungeons, since you do want to farm gold, and do it through dungeons. If so, you kind of “need” other members to run with you too, so balance that out in that you make it mutually beneficial to run - they get the chance at the loot they want, you and them get gold which I’m sure they need too.
---
If you prefer not to earn gold through dungeons, and given a choice would rather be out questing for your gold, however, then you have a lot more leverage and can impose whatever rules you want since they need you to run and you are choosing to give up your gold farming / questing to help them run the dungeon. 
---
See? If you frame it this way, you won’t have to be confused whether or not you are an asshole. If they ask, say “oh, I’m actually farming at XXX cos I need the gold, but if you give me all the thorium veins / orbs etc then I could help you guys out.” Ball is in their court and you won’t have to worry about being the asshole.
---
Lol thats what the + implies. I got 30+ bag slots....not including what I'm currently equipped or in bank. Of just gear I'm constantly swapping thru...i have atleast 8 setups on my itemrack add-on. Its definantly the struggle of a drood
---
&gt; Some people call it greed
---
Sure do.
---
There's no point until Dragons come out.
---
You're right, it definitely ups the ante but, having literally 10x the amount of people on a server compared to 15 years ago is a bigger factor. 40 people min maxing is a lot easier to deal with than 400 min maxing. 
---
Especially since the population imbalances just get worse (raw numbers) as you scale up the size of the server. Server sizes definitely should not have ballooned the way they did.
---
Out of topic how you put the alliance logo there ,
---
I've never seen anyone so greedy that they reserve **all** orbs. It's pretty standard to only reserve the *first* orb as tank, then you roll as normal on remaining orbs.
---
While asking for gold/equivalent may or may not be a step too far I see no problems with some kind of split of the loot where you get all ore and/or a number of the greens and trash blues.
---
It all comes down to how close you feel you are to them. And make sure they know there's nothing in there for you before you ask for compensation.
---
Yeah, I rolled Horde in Vanilla and we were greatly outnumbered - certainly on my server, but I think on most of them if memory serves. The difference is that there were just far fewer players on the server and the endgame PvP was far more \*concentrated\* as a result. TM/SS, for sure, every night, usually LHC and BRM. Periodic raids on Crossroads, Orgrimmar and occasionally UC. There just weren't enough Alliance to zerg every 48+ zone in the game.
---
It was fucking \*fun\*. I loved being the underdog. I knew where I could go when I wanted to fight the good fight. I knew what to expect and had the ability to prepare with my guild if I needed to fight my way into BRM. I despised the Alliance, sure, but that was part of the experience.
---
I expected much the same this go around. I rolled Horde on Stalagg a week before launch. All I knew was a buddy said they were re-releasing Vanilla so I was \*in.\* I expected much the same experience as Horde that I had the first time.
---
I was a little bummed and jealous pre-phase 2: being the dominant faction just isn't as fun. Now, I feel no hate for the Alliance at all...I just feel bad for them. Even the couple private-server tryhard guilds can't stem the tide. I still get ganked by Alliance deathballs, but only because I don't have to bother preparing. I'll travel solo to Strat, Scholo, BRM, DM and maybe a deathball will get me...once. Usually not. OTOH, Alliance trying to get into instances or do late-game quests even in groups are in for a hell of a time. They have to stay grouped and coordinated and just rez-crawl their way to the portal.
---
TL;DR I've seen wPvP on an unbalanced server in Vanilla. It was hella fun. Faction imbalance isn't the problem. The problem is faction imbalance when there are 3, 4 or 5 times as many players on the server. What was once concentrated becomes widely distributed and there's really no counter and no escape. Hopefully BGs will improve the experience for Stalagg Alliance, but one thing is for sure: These servers will simply never be able to offer a Vanilla experience. The population increase changes everything.
---
Similarly, I black-list tanks who demand all non-needed greens / blues in an instance. Would rather keep looking for a few more minutes than capitulate to that kind of blackmail lol.
---
Plenty of reasonable tanks out there thankfully, people who recognize that although tanks are rare, doing an instance is nevertheless a team activity.
---
They're only BiS for raiding. If you are an LFG Hero like me it's a waste of money... I wish more people on this sub would clarify that. All these people assume if you play that you must also raid. So they jerk off Edgemaster's hand guards and tell you they're equal to 3% hit and then you go waste 365 fucking gold on these pieces of shit that are worthless to me. Everytime I tried to learn or understand weapon skill people would just tell me "oh don't worry it's 3%" I feel like shit. I can't do anything right can't even fucking gear up in a video game correctly.
---
Yep we want a new fresh eventually. Keep in mind reddit is mostly people who joined this subreddit 3 months ago coming over from retail or a different game. People who really love vanilla are still playing classic but this is not the venue to find them in for the most part. Or at least they are severely outnumbered by the casual masses.
---
They def ban them, already seen two.
---
Shift-V is friendly nameplates by default, but is see your point.
---
In a comment I have read that icyveins and wowhead BiS guides are not good.
---
Any guide you guys recommend for ret Paladin?
---
Eh dreams are nice to have and tbh a classic server with some changes mostly to classes would be nice, but Blizzard is about making money not appeasing fans.
---
I played both original vanilla in 2005 and several psevers. Always on PVP.
---
i thought it would be a bit more hectic than in 2005 but nowhere near  the craziness of this classic situation. The major reason for these expectations obviously is that we didn't expect the population in classic to be this LARGE.   in 2005 it was 3000ish. I counted on a bit higher pop now, let's say 5000 but it's much more.  It's more than triple here. 
---
On a server with less people, you will still see plenty of action, but the world is big and you would be able to find some peace at the corners of the world.    Here , reports are that people are pushed out to every corner so no spot is uncontested
---
Its interesting, turning on the honor system has had some interesting effects. As an alliance character (lvl 46) on a pvp server it seems like every ?? now kills, whereas before you had maybe a 50/50 chance of being ganked. As my server (and most pvp) are horde heavy questing becomes nigh on impossible. Honestly all these people saying "well you should of played on a pve server", you're 100% right, I should have. 
---
Theres this weird thing that players do (at least where im from) where we look down on people who play on PvE servers (tease them and look down on them) and being a red blooded male I wasnt about to prove them correct, but I am wrong. The truth is ever since P2 has come out i've lost interest completely in wow classic, the 'pvp experience' (which lets be honest, is less world pvp and more high levels camping/griefing) is not for me. So to answer your question there is very little gratification I get from playing the game currently so currently, nothing is motivating me.
---
Warden scans your entire computer? What?
---
What’s the gear switch addon called?
---
More people are enjoying it than you think, the minority are just the vocal majority. Everyone else is too busy having fun to whine on forums about something they knew was coming before they paid for their sub fee.
---
Random Dutch word as a nickname, love it. “Vuilnisman” &amp; “Knokploeg”
---
Your guildies are taking advantage of your kindness. You really need to start asking for stuff.
---
You spend effort, time and gold for repairs, you need to get something good out of this.
---
Okay, so the first line basically means that if you are in bear form, to shift out of bear form, right?  Stance 1 = Bear.
---
What does /cast [nostance:3] mean?  Stance 3 is cat?  No stance would be caster form, right?
---
If it's guildies? I don't think you're an asshole for it, but I wouldn't expect anything for it other than competent/geared players making your raids smoother later. Just because you're "done" and want to save up doesn't entitle you to more. With that said, let them know ahead of time at the very least you want to get -something- out of the dungeon so there's no drama later with either them whining or you frustrated because they're not sharing. Communication of intent is key.
---
Non-guildies? Go for it. Reserve shit or charge for that service if you want to.
---
Yes we know.. this same thing is said in every thread.  On horde dominated servers alliance still kill people, still do some stuff.  The side you don't see is that any alliance ganking squad will usually get grouped up on, crushed and camped for 30 minutes once horde figure it out.
---
You simply. Can't. Beat. Numbers.  Not in the long term, at least.  The reality is while horde will still get owned 1v10 on these servers, it's happening twice as often to alliance.
---
So many mount beggars on the streets of SW. I feel for them, it’s a struggle.
---
As I replied to another person, yeah the % definitely has increased but, the sheer number of people doing this is the bigger issue. 100% of 3500 is still way less than 50% of 40000.
---
Even if you took an old server and made it 100% min maxers, the issue wouldn't be as prevalent as servers that are 30k + having half the pop being min maxers. The issue is that we now how both _much_ higher pop _and_ a larger portion of the playerbase doing this.
---
A small server can't lock down 2 entire zones (SG/BS) and BRM. A server of 30k+ easily can, along with now DM and any other 50+ zone.
---
There’s a dude on Skeram running a summoning service to every major city and Duke Hydraxis. 3g to summon. All of them are his alts.
---
I use a combination of cast sequence totems for PvE totem sets and individual cast totems for pvp.
---
5/shift 5 are earth bind and grounding. Shift D is mana spring, ctrl3-5 are poison disease healing stream (ngl I never use healing stream should just get rid of it).
---
Shift A and shift S are searing, fire nova. ctr 2 is R1 magma (yeah that one's a late addition and a little weird). Shift W is for resistance totem, which I've changed from fire to frost resistance in scholomance like once.
---
Finally I have a single key for my PvE cast sequence totems. I manually swap that in/out because I have 5 different sets.
---
Vuilnisman is my warlock main, guild is knokploeg on razorgore eu :D
---
Normally with 2x crippling poison after initial combo just stay close enough so they cant intercept but far enough they wont reach you with melee, then just restealth rinse and repeat 😁
---
Winterspring and felwood have a shit load of quests.
---
It literally won’t ever give away your position. Spy will alert you if there’s an enemy that’s within 50 yards of you.
---
It's still shitty to spend 100g a week if they swap between PvP and PvE spec, compared to having an alt that'll avoid having that cost AND make more gph
---
There was a post earlier in the week about a GM coming into the game and demanding players get down from the roof. So I certainly think it’s frowned upon/not allowed.
---
Here's your obligatory yes, and thanks for reiterating this point that horde have to incessantly bring up in every thread on this subject.
---
I used to go there for the Moonwell to make Mooncloth before discovering there was one in Stormwind...
---
You get more casts out of your mana pool with HotW spec than you do with Moonglow.
---
Not gonna watch horde raid, homo horde
---
It’s true it’s less threat. You’re missing the 10% physical damage from 11 points in the balance tree and 3% crit from leader of the pack. However, I feel like you have more than enough tools to make up for the loss but you gotta work harder. Pre HOTing yourself, moonfire some on the way in and marking skull can all mitigate the loss. I don’t have many issues with threat in 5 mans. 
---
I’m not really dedicated tank or healer. I can honestly say I do both about 50/50.
---
I forgot, but it was something about setting user flair.
---
In a prep/cold blood spec, which is a pvp spec, you'd most likely use backstab, not sinister strike or hemorrhage. The benefit of Hemorrhage lies in its low energy cost (30 vs 60 for backstab and 40 for talented sinister strike) so its useful to rack up combo points quickly. The extra damage of backstab is typically more useful, but where hemorrhage comes into play is in two cases: 1) You wish to stun lock an enemy. With its low energy cost, you can get up to a 5 combo point kidney shot in the duration of cheap shot. 2) Against a high armor enemy (paladin/warrior). In this case, the added damage of backstab isn't going to help much, so your goal is to garrote and then build up to a rupture or expose armor as quickly as you can, and hemorrhage helps in this regard.
---
Now, to get back to your main question about hemorrhage and it not being "normalized", I don't know the specifics about it (hopefully someone else here does), but my understanding is that back before instant attack normalization, instant attack got a disproportionate amount of attack power as they were based solely on the weapon damage (the range on the character sheet), but after normalization, the weapon damage contribution from attack power (which tends to be more than from the weapon itself) was "normalized for weapon speed" such that instant attacks received the same benefit from attack power, regardless of how slow or fast the weapon was (before, slower weapons received a larger amount of weapon damage from attack power). Normalized attacks still benefit from slower weapons since the damage range will be higher, but it is not so great that fast weapons are unviable.
---
Hemorrhage was missed in this update and wasn't changed into shortly into TBC.
---
TL;DR what this means is that Hemorrhage benefits greatly from a slow weapon (2.5+), far more than any other instant attack in rogues' arsenal.
---
The problem with those guides is they're too static. You'll do better with a site like Sixtyupgrades.com and an understanding of your Hit requirements.
---
Even with cross realm, horde queues will always be higher. As it has been since forever.
---
Of course they ban in waves.  They detect how the software works, log everyone who uses it over a period of time and then bring down the hammer.
---
Census scans show more horde than alliance in the 50-60 range last 7 days. It’s improving with the influx of horde guilds transferring.
---
Human and night elf hidden racials.  Dwarven and Undead have the anti of whatever you want to call it.  Then again, who wants to hang around when you have an angry wrinkled naked woman charging at you yelling if you want a dance?

Moonglow is a great spec buuuuut I don't think we have the gear to support it yet. I remember giving it a try and just running OOM way, way more often. I think with BWL, or even maybe on the 10th if you can manage to get either AV exalted weps or World Boss weps it's viable, but until then HotW is incredibly good because you just don't go oom.
---
u/Nineteen27 Yep, got it recently. Smashing people with 1.8k Mortal strikes and 1.5k white autos with couple stacks up. Rogues getting nuked with 1.3k overpowers right out of stealth when no stack is applied.
---
If you manage to get a targets armor from 2100 down to 0, that's a 27% damage increase. The weapon with all stacks up does up to 97DPS. It's really that ridiculous and the reason why pserver with their progressive itemisation put in the earliest iteration with only one stack applicable to balance it out somewhat.
---
Currently clothis dont have that much health and go for tier gear if they can acquire it.
---
I literally oneshot people without windfury. Charge, 1200 white swing, 1600 MS, sword/HoJ proc, dead.
---
With windfury I often hit for 2100 damage without any crits whatsoever. 900er non crit MS. It's a dream.
---
BRE is rather shitty on boss DPS because all but Sulfuron have 0 armor after the proper debuffs are applied.
---
Oh 100% true. It'd be nice if druids had out of combat rez for example. But *current* Blizzard is about making money. You don't want something like that making Classic+.
---
It was in Tipsout interview.  I recall them only saying cross realm.
---
Gold buying goes against all Classic stands for. You are stupid if you dont report them.
---
That would indeed be a very easy work-around. They wouldn't even have to redesign any parts of the world.
---
That's literally 100% exactly what it is on PvE servers.
---
Last night I was camped for 45 mins by a 60 mage In tanaris. He killed me over 15 times. Doesn't honor stop at 4 kills?
---
From my experiences it’s the vanilla players that weren’t prepared for this because they expected the “classic experience”. The players that saw this coming are private server players and retail pvpers.
---
Give female dwarfs beards blizzard! Otherwise you will never see naked dwarf women, at the very least I expect to see a five'o'clock shadow.
---
Glad I picked mankrik I guess lok
---
We have weekly have 160 vs 160 or more on Fairbanks for BRM. There’s lag...
---
It’s called balance 😌
---
Weapon skill does more than just % hit.
---
Agreed. People are always overhyping getting something new and different. We’ve seen it before. Blizzard’s implementation really isn’t perfect, but this game as it is is way more fun with lasting play value than TBC or even other versions of vanilla.
---
They take mages and druids for their utility abilities. The point I'm making is that the boomkin made it in because of their utility, just like pretty much every character in there who isn't a rogue or warrior so the argument "they weren't bringining them for the dps" applies to half the raid.
---
nah. i'm on grobb and horde is more slighty favored. and BRM is still full of horde camping there. sometimes a alliance raid comes in a clears but they dont stay for hours camping people like the horde does.
---
If the enemy is over a hill a behind a tree but within 50 yards. That isn't fair, why is line of sight even in the game? I'm not whining, certain add-ons add features to the game..
---
Lol, you made me laugh , you almost sounded honest ... You enjoy it, and a lot otherwise you would wait for BG and do something else. Period.
---
Well ideally they leave these servers around and give you the option to copy your player into something like Classic(The Burning Crusade).
---
Alcohol withdrawal man, one of the few that will actually kill you
---
Uber on Grobbulus is where it’s at.
---
It's still one of the most visited zones at 60 due to the Bay of Storms fishing and Hydraxian Waterlords.
---
The funniest part to me is you usually only see rank 2's and 3's doing this shit.
---
It's one thing if you are going for bracket 1-3 honor every week and doing this.
---
If you aren't going for top honor weekly and doing this I honestly have no fucking idea what you are doing with your time. I honestly can't think of a more pathetic or less fulfilling way to pass the time.
---
Just pretend its frostbolt ;P
---
Can you not just... make a hybrid spec on your mage? Isn't that the best solution here?
---
People care a lot more about good PvP racials in TBC because of Arena. Blood elves have insane racials, and WotF, stun resist, and extra hp/warstomp are all the more important. (And for what it's worth, horde gets fear ward too in TBC).
---
You can keep your loot. The thing is having a character is full BiS only has so much play value when the game is finished (keep in mind everyone else including the competition has full BiS too) the reality of Vanilla WoW is that a big part of gearing is staying ahead of the gearing curve.
---
In half of the pugs I've been, I was the only druid. I'm pretty sure they would take me even if i had the most stupid talents and weared greys
---
Lol nice
---
You don’t
---
Flying mounts were fine
---
800g on firemaw lol
---
Thanks, I h8 it.
---
It's really not unusual. I'd say most players like to mess around with people by taking them hostage and doing silly things. Makes the game interesting. But just camping over and over is lame
---
I could go on a parachute jump, have the parachute not open until the last possible second to land safely and DMT would still be my #1 most incredible life experience afterwards
---
100g 2h ZF vs 1-60 in maybe 168h? Huh :D
---
If you wanna see the bot army wake up do a who of maraudon at 12am and watch the nightfin oily bot army wake up
---
Back in the day, people would do this by having a disconnect button installed in their hardwired Ethernet cable. Pressing (and holding) the button would interrupt the internet connection, which would be restored upon releasing the button. The result was "teleporting" similar to what you describe as the server and client attempted to reconcile where the player was.
---
I was under the impression that Blizzard fixed this by having the server assume the player stood still and took no actions if contact was lost with the player, rather than assuming they kept going in whatever direction they were running, and that they stopped allowing actions that you "que'd up" while disconnected to be processed simultaneously (which was an early attempt to compensate for poor internet connections) and instead, it would simply process whatever the first command you entered was, when the connection was restored. They also decreased the amount of time the server would wait for you to re-establish connection before it would disconnect you from the server, kicking you to the login screen.
---
I am curious if these changes made it into Classic. If they did not, the aforementioned exploit (or others like it) would be quite effective and very disruptive to pvp balance.
---
That's what I figured would happen but I was farming a recipe drop in the area for an hour and that mob didn't despawn. The bot would try to loot, move a few feet then attempt to loot again, over and over. I guess that resets a timer.
---
If he’s 50 yards away from you, over a hill, you won’t know he’s over that hill. Nameplates max range at 15 yards I believe.
---
I remember in vanilla making a warrior alt and just absolutely wrecking people when I was 39. I had guildies run me through SM a ton to level, so I just ended up with all that SM blue gear and it was ridiculous how powerful it was without even trying to set up BiS twink gear. I had a blast.
---
You must be on a very high pop server but on my servers a small unorganized group of 20 horde can take out the alliance in various zones. It's not usual. With smaller numbers would come less Alliance back-up and more organization (guild's only stick with themselves and camp specific and strategic zones, also making sure not to step on other guilds)
---
Our dps warriors bring tank gesr for off tanking, sounds like they need a kick up the ass lol
---
Yeah, your inability to read makes any further conversation pointless.
---
You Seem to Be confused too
---
So you want to hold players hostage in the version of the game you like because you don't like the version they want? There's absolutely enough interested players to fill servers for retail, classic, tbc, and probably even cata and beyond. Let people drcide for themselves what they want. If one version of the game dies for lack of players, then that tells you all you need to know about what people want.
---
I don’t know, all I know was it was behind the FP tower for like a week in the same position.
---
Isn't there a hive in southern ungoro?
---
How is it Toxic? It’s these kinda pussy ass comments that get me mad
---
Definitely check out Kargath if you’re an alliance rogue or Druid (or have a duo of mages). I pretty much went kamikaze spec for most burst possible to get 1 or 2 kills (sometimes 3) and repeat after dying. Camp Mojache is also in a similar boat with the graveyard being right next to it for alliance.
---
If you’re horde, I’ve heard that booty bay using the gnomer teleporter to drop guard aggro is also good!
---
It would potentially reduce camping somewhat. There will always be griefers but if there is less griefing overall that is still a big win.
---
Part of the reason BRM camping is so prevalent in Skeram is because it is lucrative to camp people running in. If you take away that incentive then you'll at least reduce their numbers a bit and Alliance players will have slightly more fair(ish) fight opportunities.
---
I agree, back in vanilla I could farm a tier 1 location uncontested most of the time, right now there is at least 4 people on that spot, and at least 2 people on tier 2 locations 24/7
---
he’s right though.
---
I just went there the other day because the non discovered map bothered me. You don't even have to go in, just up the ramp a little
---
Fair point
---
Grats, this is the biggest waste of time I've seen in Classic so far
---
It was shit then because then dungeons became go go go.
---
I'd hoped to find someone of that opinion. Don't you think it just became a quality of life improvement that you've then become used to and unwilling to drop?
---
In other words: What did it add to the game besides less traveling time? It certainly removed 90% of world pvp.
---
So would Priest be better? I have some good boe cloth gear, and was originally planning to make a 19 priest but started also leveling a mage when I realized how many rogues would be around.
---
wow it’s almost as if blizzard benefits from you having multiple accounts
---
So you ran away and then became the exact thing you were running away from?
---
But follows are free
---
Got any links?
---
Enchantrix is the one I use, not sure if it's the one in the pic...didnt really look at it before I started answering lol
---
I rerolled on a 'dead' server and it is now High
---
I played a bit of retail in the last couple years before classic and it actually turns out to be the opposite in BGs. While Horde maintain a higher population, and it seems that they are able to more easily find groups and excel in PVE (for the average player), in BGs it is exacty the opposite. Waiting 10 minutes to get into a BG meant that Horde players barely played them at all, and when they did they were rarely organized. Alliance getting insta-queues meant they had more experience and could find groups more easily. I lost the overwhelming majority of my PUG'd BGs as a Horde player. 
---
Tl;dr PvE was generally a better experience for Horde, while BGs was heavily skewed towards Alliance. I assume Classic will be similar.
---
OK that is good to know. I assumed regardless of line of sight that spy woudk just alert you of enemy presence. Maybe I'll download it so I know how it works.
---
FYI, people will be presenting this information through a channel instead so.. sorry it's still gonna be shitty bros :(
---
Can’t swap that gear mid fight last time I checked. Which was the guys whole point.
---
As a feral druid, what level should I be to tank BRD?
---
I am commited to my first level 60 alliance and hope it will be better as soon as BGs are out, I have started leveling a horde meanwhile though but probably will be a slow leveling expirence.
---
On PvP realms. Alliance tend to be higher on PvE realms which are also linked on crossrealm. That said Horde is likely still ahead due to how many PvP compared to PvE.
---
Razorgore for a untamed blade.
---
Ok.
---
[Battleshout Tracker](https://wago.io/S1u7ESyrX)
---
I often got carried away myself and made the tracker as annoying as possible to remind me (glow with a bigass icon)
---
Lol at propel thinking they know how blizzard wants to spend their money. It was the same mentality that lead to everyone doubting that Classic was going to happen.
---
What do you do when you're maxed out in classic? Raidlog? Farm a bit? Bgs? All of those things plus arenas and more are available post classic.
---
This is not true. Warden scans all the signals your computer sends to the Blizzard server, and can check the integrity of your game files, but that is all. Any more would be a serious invasion of privacy, and the fines and other penalties that Blizzard would face for doing this are way worse than whatever consequences Blizzard has from taking longer to figure out if somebody is a bot.
---
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what an exploit is. You are only looking at the results and not the methods used. That's your mistake.
---
Hogging all the honor or chain cc'ing until honorless flass off is not the exploit. The methods used to achieve this are the exploit.
---
Duels are designed to prevent help from external sources. This design mechanic is being abused to prevent any counterplay. Typically you could heal or dispel your ally who was being farmed (they won't but it's possible). By absuing the duel mechanic the only player allowed to interact with the victim is the mage in the duel. There is no counterplay. Allies can't not intervene to help their friend. Absuing the design of duels to prevent counterplay is the exploit.
---
This^^
---
Tanks who demand all the norm loot for filling a role are assholes
---
As someone who isn't aware of OSRS, what would that be?
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Warlocks own the 49 bracket as affi or demo .. Affi cant die with tab target SL and get over 2-3k soul fire crits as demo.. Still have my 49 from vanilla with over 250k kills havnt touchd him since tbc
---
i want to try shaman for the first time. i would use a levelling spec till late 50s. i was wondering if there was an elemental/resto hybrid out there? i want to do elemental but i want to be useful in raids too
---
“I am a horde and the servers are all 50/50 cmon alliance git gud.”
---
As hard as Ulda is, it’s easier than ST! Only way you can do the pre 60 dungeons is to join a big guild and find others leveling alts. Agree with above that I’m more successful when I put together my own group.
---
Priest would work better, the shield adds a lot of survivability. Also healers are super valuable in BGs.
---
TBC had some very fun memorable content but overall it was a much worse game people are remembering only from the positives. We’ll probably get TBC because yes the popularity of Vanilla exploded near the end of its life by TBC so of course it had a huge population of players. Phenomenons like this game take years to reach peak popularity, that’s the simple reason why TBC had the population it did.
---
Yes, I'm talking as a guild. The point is you can't just skip straight to BWL in dungeon pre-bis. You need 40 Ony kills.
---
If you're still doing this, I need help fixing my Fishing Macro with Lorespinner and Malistar's Defender:
---
/equip \[noequipped:Big Iron Fishing Pole,mod:shift\] Big Iron Fishing Pole; \[mod:shift\] Lorespinner
---
/use \[mod:ctrl\] Aquadynamic Fish Attractor
---
/use \[mod:ctrl\] Big Iron Fishing Pole
---
/cast \[nomod\] Fishing
---
I used to use it all the time, and then as I was getting high 50's and started changing weapons. I stopped updating it. Now I can't get it to function properly. I'm not sure how to add in the Malistar's Defender. Thanks in advance.
---
Agreed, there truly are no words that can do it justice
---
It's a curse that reduces incoming healing by 75%. 
---
Besides the aforementioned dungeons (scholo,  strat), it's also in UBRS. As soon as it goes on it needs to come off or your healers won't be able to sustain the damage your tanks take.
---
Really? I've only seen people insult horde for daring to roll them.
---
Nice ... How often does the healing set bonus proc?
---
Yes and no.
---
No: You're not obligated to do any of it, and if you don't want to run something, then don't do it.
---
Yes: Simply saying no, will suffice. If you don't want to do it, don't make up some elaborate reason as to why you don't want to, and then make up some sort of incentive structure around your answer.
---
Imagine this scenario. You have a job, and your old boss contacts you and says, "Hey, mind coming back to work for me part-time for a while? I could really use the help." And you respond, "Yeah sure. But instead of the old pay, I need to get paid triple my old salary." Just say no.
---
holy crap thats a lot of warriors as well.
---
This is it right here. The people doing this are the rank 3's that still play 14 hours a day but can't manage to win enough solo fights to get bracket 1-3 for honor.
---
A handful of them are even rank two.
---
Like it's one thing if you're a top honor farmer and doing this but if you're not in the first three brackets of honor and still doing this you need to re-evaluate.
---
I actually have no idea what has to be wrong with someone to play like this only to end up with mediocre results. Can anyone think of a more pathetic or less fulfilling way to the spend their time? That's not rhetorical.
---
Lol 👌🏼
---
Wait, how old are you to still use emojis like that? Lmao
---
Boe farming MC
---
This is me 😂
---
And to them I respond, I would rather just look for a different tank? Dungeons aren't profitable for anyone except the tank if they get all the orbs. Like why bother doing strat in that case?
---
Someone call the hospital, this man was just seriously burned!
---
There are. You're just seeing right through them.
---
Or how many times has warstomp allowed you to cast that one extra heal to turn it all around?
---
Don't follow this guy's advice unless you want to become the meme of the server discord.
---
If the servers weren't 90% orc warriors, undead mages and undead rogues I'd be inclined to believe you, but since they are I think it's more likely people rolled Horde to minmax
---
Doesn’t look like anything to me.
---
Without re-using any of the content after classic? So our equivalent would be new content but without touching anything from tbc+?
---
&gt; I'm still gonna do my job but if I'm not guaranteed an orb then I'm just not gonna tank it.
---
That's fine, plenty of more reasonable tanks out there.
---
how do people log out instantly when im chasing them in fights? when i try to do it, i get the 20sec timer :/
---
Yeah it's nuts on ah pricing, the greater fire protection potion recipe on thunderfury is going for 400g each.
---
Potions themselves are 40g each.
---
Not sure how people can afford to start raiding at the current state of the game. I just got attuned for both 40 mans and have no gear, no recipes, no epic mount.
---
It's so daunting and I can blame server sizes.
---
Considering the orphanage is next door to this cathedral, this might actually be true.
---
60g by 23...? Any tips?
---
Exactly brand new never before seen content unique to classic
---
they probably got summoned somewhere
---
looks like a hack/exploit forum, with a bunch of posts of people whining about being banned :)
---
Evasion before he kicks your face in, not once overpower will finish you off.

Only major upgrades left for me are either drops from MC or a Breastplate of Bloodthirst
---
Honestly you need a lot of people abusing it for a short time to have something done about it. If only a handful had kept this secret it likely would have flown under the radar. 
---
Also this will create more competition for the ones doing it and they may end up deciding its not nearly as profitable as it once was.
---
This is a cut and dry exploit and with enough exposure it will be addressed just as the environment exploit in pvp was addressed.
---
Inpopular opinion here. I will preface this with saying my main is herbalism and the bots do effect any gold making I could earn. However, as a raider, if we didn't have bots farming consumables, the prices would be crazy high. I think exploiting is wrong and they should be banned. I just wanted to bring that point up as something to keep in mind.
---
I could not have written a better response. Kudos!
---
People accept these terms because without it there just wouldn't be any tanks. No one is going to spend hours and hours running dungeons for no reward. I've never been in a run with tanks taking drops and also asking for all boes.
---
More like "...now with Paladins"
---
Just from vendoring and pots or are you selling chest drops too?
---
Ew, blood elves are wack
---
I also had a Druid naked Mcqueefy
---
I started zf at 44, you should be able to do it at 43!
---
I went there to make Mooncloth for like 2 Month before I realized there is one in SW.
---
I mean not really though.
---
He's bringing up a real point that duel design mechanics are being abused to create situations in which there is no counterplay.
---
Are the upset and a Lil salty? Sure they are are. Doesn't make this any less of an exploit.
---
Tbh just level a second mage... keep one for raiding and one for farming... then level a third for PVP! Mage is the superior class! Blizzards spoiled love child.
---
In my opinion, yeah. For all the reasons I just listed.
---
Wouldn't affect**
---
we are probably better than yours. like others told you, its a paladin BiS too and priority does go to high performing senior member of the guild that contributes more.
---
Interesting. Why not recycle some good parts of the expansions tho? I'd prefer classic+ than simply reliving retail years later. That being said, I wouldn't say no to some content being reused without things that weren't welcome in retail. Seems like it'd be the best of both world wouldn't it? Otherwise I can hardly see Blizzard develop basically two different games for one sub
---
Who are you upset with exactly?
---
It's a bit more like asking to not work at a loss, but okay.
---
I was really surprised when I discovered that a few weeks ago
---
I think you mean a c ‚ c ÇÈ ‚ f 30
---
Mooncloth, probably
---
Then I suppose we disagree.
---
drop it and pickup mining
---
Same goes for me. Vanilla was mostly me being run down by a tier 2 level 60 with an epic mount. I had some crazy, spontaneous fights in Hellfire and Nagrand back in the day. Even won against a few level 70s while I was level 66-67.
---
I don’t play him much just to be safe lol
---
Feelings mutual bud
---
Lol I fucking love it
---
Obviously he's being willfully ignorant because he thinks his expertise in financing matters to making an enjoyable game experience that would keep a dedicated playerbase subscribed.
---
They literally have the best atmosphere in all of WoW. How can you!
---
You didn’t say if you were on the right side or not?
---
The issue now is that people have to sacrifice honor/PvP ranks in order to farm gold. Between respecs for raid, consumables, and repairs, you'll go through 60g in a day pretty easily. I'm not complaining, it's just impossible to do both and not everyone wants to sacrifice progression towards the best loot in the game right now, so I disagree with your claim of laziness.
---
Alliance on Whitemane, I’m enjoying being the minority a bit.
---
Sure the Horde are like cockroaches, but it adds a challenge- you have to do hit and runs instead of just camping, and it makes it even more rewarding when you do take over a zone every once in a while. 
---
I’m also guessing the chain camping will die down once the Taiwan guilds figure out that honor gains have diminishing returns so chain camping for hours is a bit pointless, but who knows on that one.

You got a spider on your camera lense
---
Its all about player perception, i play on the same server horde side, and the alliance demolishes de horde in feralas(always raid groups) all the time, epl and wpl most of the times, and ally also has death squads roaming around the world, tbh our server is balanced cause horde is in charge of some zones ally is in charge of others, but its the popular opinion to hate on the horde and cry on the alliance so what do i know
---
You talk like you never played TBC, Vanilla was a joke in terms of PvE beside some bosses in BLW, AQ40 and Naxx, in PvP it was just a stupid grind for rank14 with overpowered classes like warlocks and rogues killing Rank 14 players naked with a lvl 10 dagger.
---
Flying did not killed anything, all the lvl 70 players packed in a small continent like Outland fighting for resources the world PvP was the best ever, you had fights around any corner from the moment you step into Hellfire Pen.
---
World PvP died when they introduced bgs in the game but you have selective memory it seems and blame it all on flying when on my server and many others world PvP in TBC was very healthy.
---
You talk about casuals and epics while forgetting Molten Core and Onyxia can be cleared by eight year old kids and getting full epic with no skill required and you compare heroics dungeons in TBC that are hard and design for geared players that need to pay attention and still use CC not like Wotlk heroics, on top of that the badge gear require a good amount of badges to get it, I agree that on further patches some badge gear gets better then tier gear but those catch up mechanics existed in Vanilla also.
---
Daily quests are optional, no one is forcing you to do them because they don't give bis gear or anything like that, they just give random things like mounts and recipes,pets, tabards, some give medium quality gear and gold but again this is not Wotlk.
---
TBC is way harder then Vanilla both PvE and PvP, is not a perfect expansion for sure but when you talk like Vanilla is perfect it really shows how much of a fanboy you are forgetting how much of that awful game design Vanilla had, from the PvP system that was total trash from start to finish to PvE that while it had nice dungeons like BRD,UBRS,STRAT most of the 40man raids are a joke, Vanilla started x-ream bgs destroying the PvP rivalry, Vanilla destroyed world PvP introducing battlegrounds, Vanilla introduced DKs killing what was left of the world PvP, let's not even talk about how in Vanilla PvE raiding scene druid/paladin/shaman are forced into healing.
---
TBC is a better version of Vanilla but I admit it had errors and is not perfect, my perfect version of WoW is something between Vanilla and TBC with the zone design of Wotlk, I hope Blizz will release TBC servers and Wotlk servers because there is vast majority of players that enjoy those expansions and while I don't like Wotlk that much I wont be a jerk and deny people like Blizz use to do with Vanilla servers a few years ago.
---
Dude, you're a dwarf.
---
Get that damn bucket of your head, and let that magnificent beard of yours hang free!
---
As someone who has farmed an Arcanite reaper, lionheart helmet, and stronghold gauntlets in azshara I'll tell you that it's one of the best zones for RTV
---
Whoa my dude, why are you so pissy? Were you the 60 paladin who got tossed by a lowbie? Pretty embarrassing!
---
So it seems like your real issue is with cross realm LFG.  What if they added server only?
---
The issue is that the final couple rooms are like level 58, so it's rough for someone below 56 to damage anything
---
i dont care if i loose every bg i just dont want to wait 30minutes
---
No to mention not everyone is such a diehard fan of vanilla that we'll want more after phase 6 has been going on for a while. Twice will be enough for me.
---
Eh, if by 'this scale' you mean roving Horde death squads, that was been the entirety of BFA's war-mode especially in Nazjatar until the Alliance just stopped turning it on.
---
There are actually items worth spending gold on in classic.
---
I suggest playing a few to 30 at least cause by then many classes have lots of their tools, pre 20 you aren't learning much about the class
---
Realest post here
---
Real talk this add-on NEEDS to be banned, its game breaking, promotes the toxic corpse camping that everyone hates, drastically affects stealth classes, its shit and needs to be banned, its insane they haven't banned it yet
---
Movement speed is a large factor.
---
You should tell that to the people who invited me at 43 before we steamrolled it. Some classes get +hit from talents that makes it much more manageable to kill higher levels.
---
Most important is just buy some int flasks. Since you cant really get +holy damage the only way to do more damage is by casting more holy novas. 
---
I use int flasks and use greater mana potions. Whichever ones restore like 600 mana.
---
&gt; Unpopular opinion: People putting unpopular opinion in their title are attention seeking hoes.
---
This!!!
---
People talk about horde because they dominate basically every pvp server.. has little to do with a belief that the faction is intrinsically inferior or whatever.
---
Of course they are feminine. They're all women, after all!
---
My undead mage is Bussanutt, May Tauren warrior is lemmesmash, and my undead rogue is Brogurt. I get a lot of messages about brogurt lol
---
/r/suicidebywords
---
this guy right here, follow him
---
Lots of copper ore
---
Sounds like you’ve learnt something about classic. This is a good thing. Many, many, people play on PvE servers because they have already learnt this lesson. 
---
Welcome to PvE. Come on in, the water is not full of gank’gators.
---
Honestly, flying mounts removed 90% of unwanted world pvp. A lot of people still Pvp'd in the world, like me. It's like the other guy said: you won't get uber camped, but there's nothing to stop someone from flying in hot while you're fighting a mob etc. I actually think it's perfect now that I think about it. It removed world pvp from being a requirement just to travel, but getting ganked was still a reality if you were doing anything other than traveling. I kinda like that.
---
&gt; and its the same on every other server
---
Not on stalagg and skeram. Not saying alliance death squads don't exist, but getting ganked once or twice is completely different from being literally unable to quest. I've completed 3 non-dungeon quests since the war started.
---
All this would happen without the add-on. SPY is here to stay!
---
lmao I'm Alliance :)
---
The trash right after before and after baron drop an AOE. The fireaalkers or whatever. It's a LARGE fire AOE that does 700 every second and a half or 2 seconds. 
---
Basically just walk away from the little fire patch it leaves when it dies.
---
I don't think they can ban a list of who you killed and when. I do think apps like this contribute to toxic behaviours though
---
it happened once 15 years ago. it will happen again in 15 hence.
---
My fave part is all the delicious rouge tears
---
I am a warrior and leveling engineering. Mostly concerning about pvp. What is the better choice, gnomish or goblin? 
---
If I am correct, most stuff from goblin is BoE and tradeable right? 
---
I dont think I will go to level it up all again for a 2nd time to have all the engi items.

Look at all these nerds you've offended OP! How dare you roll Orc! How dare you defend yourself! It was all luck anyway!

I wouldn't say following someone's stream counts as an "out of game service". Promoting his stream isn't the same as making others oblige to follow his stream. To even think this is reportable as "gold trading" is baffling.
---
Stop it.
---
Get some help.
---
Like I said before ... I am a shaman healer with 8/8 T1 and full pre bis.  I am 99% sure that I am more geared than you.  I don't need shit from any instance and don't even need anything from raid either until the other healer of my guild have better heal during fight. I will never charge or reserve anything.  Why would I pay you to play the fucking game? If you don't like the game and need someone to pay you to do some dungeon maybe you should uninstall
---
Did they nerf BRD pickpocketing? Feels like I'm getting a lot more resists.
---
I thought this was a troll post, but it seems real and now I'm just sad
---
Context is everything. On a very populated server with significant faction imbalance your perception changes greatly. You'll see more players per square meter in the world, and much more of them will be  opposite faction, desperate to grind honour because so many else are and the minority faction is hard to find. You don't know anything about this kind of ordeal, with your experience being a completely different one.
---
43 is the perfect level for ZF.
---
They are completely busted. 
---
Someone attacks me without agro’ing a guard and I just try to heal until some guards eventually do something...
---
But my first heal spawns 4-5 guards that attack me first. It’s ridiculous. I’ve straight up stopped flying to Winterspring and will ride up from Felwood instead.
---
Flying was awesome.  You’re literally the first person I ever heard bitch about flying.  Now I’ve heard it all.
---
They are fine. You just have to understand that they are guidelines, and not the holy gospel.
---
He doesn’t mean that.
---
it's literally serverwide STVietnam. with invasions you at least have means to do your thing. with p2 there's no escape. you either run instances by corpse running inside, or you can not level.
---
yeah because like who tf wants Cata but tons of people want Mists
---
BG's will be cross realm from the 10th of december as far as I'm aware.
---
Ok thanks :D
---
Imagine being so low of a person you *sell* water
---
https://twitter.com/jammdoughnut1/status/1198065838814830594?s=21
---
Yeah ItemRack. I'm HotW/NS on my Druid and it's super useful.
---
I believe there is one PvP server where the Alliance are in the majority (Heartseeker).
---
Yeah, stop begging!
---
WoW Classic doesn’t have its own API that developers can use, unlike retail. 
---
This is why Auction House addons have to do the manual scanning, and why there is no armory for classic. 
---
I’m not sure if Blizzard will make these available.
---
"Go play on a private server" has never been a valid statement. Why are you paying to play classic when you could just go play a vanilla private server? 
---
The fact is that real tbc servers don't currently exist, this thread is about them hopefully existing, and you're in here acting like people leaving classic to play bc is somehow a bad thing.
---
I'm with you. This attitude people have developed is so fucking weird. Like it's a video game: if u don't want to play a certain part of it because you get nothing out of it that's up to you! But then these ppl act like it's their JOB to run dungeons and charge "fees" lol.
---
What addon is that to show the ores?
---
Lupos
---
LF guild
---
We'll see this again in hellfire peninsula, actually.
---
You should try it, you get heal sniped all the time
---
Ok, I understand what your looking for now. The action bars don't have that functionally. What you could do is use bartender or something similar. You can set them to be invisible until you move your mouse over to where it is, then it'll make it visible. Mind you the buttons will be there even if you can't see them.
---
I’m sure Blizzard has more important things to prioritize... I mean come on now
---
Where did I say it's a bad thing? I'm just pointing out how hyperbolic you're being. No one is holding you hostage sweetie - it's a video game
---
He's getting help, *and* he's #1.
---
I'd say he's doing pretty stellar.
---
It's the culture of online games today that's to blame to be fair, people are so hyperfocused on tier lists and leaderboards such as Warcraftlogs and fflogs. Even in retail where all classes perform within 10% of eachother, you still have people mocking you for picking a lower spec
---
This makes a lot of sense.  Thank you!
---
I actually went back to retail, unironically having way more fun than playing Alliance in a classic PvP realm
---
Thanks dude! It dropped today! I am super stoked!
---
I'm only 58 but HotW/NS has been great so far. Started BRD last night as healer and tank dropped so I switched to tank after we found a healer. 
---
My gear isn't even that great yet at all and I'm able to do both roles fine, at least so far in dungeons. I'm hoping I can still do MC/Ony fine and maybe BWL. I'm sure I'll have to switch to Moonglow eventually for AQ/Naxx though.
---
Holy passive aggressive batman.
---
Standard seems to be 1g for a portal. Water not sure, I never buy them as rogue.
---
And in terms of making gold, you are farming more gold with just aoe grinding DM:E or ZF without competition.
---
I think you'll find the majority will sit in org mate.
---
The only “utility” a warrior is bringing to a fight period is MS. And i stated clearly that there realistically will be another arms war in his group for MS. Warriors are tanky damage, not utility. If you’re looking for utility toll another class.
---
If you don't want to get ganked, you shouldn't have rolled on a pvp server.
---
&gt;these guys complain that the server is imbalanced but they never want to PVP
---
They don't want to PvP because of the same reason Alliance players on Horde dominated servers don't want to PvP, it's not fun when you're constantly outnumbered.
---
What was the balance before alliance left Skeram for Heartseeker?
---
Those are plenty viable. You will be doing great damage and just hope you have another war in the group for MS/target calling.  The only worry i see is a lot of fury wars rock leather bis in PvP. Don’t do that.
---
&gt; "Who is Holly Windstalker?, Alex."
---
She hit like a truck.
---
When there is no warrior using sunder armor
---
I don't see whats wrong with selling water. There are literally tons of people asking for it and offering gold for it. So why not charge for it?
---
portal is usually 1 gold, while food, as you've said, is free, sometimes they tip, sometimes they don't.   
---
but **do** sell food if they're being an asshole
---
If you are horde, you are going to be extraordinarily disappointed in a couple of weeks.
---
Good thing I knew beforehand the exact ratio on my chosen server then. Except the intial surveys were off, and by the time you figure that out you've sunk in too much time and resources, made friends, joined a guild, etc., and then it's practically impossible to interact with the open world outside of joining deathsquads. 
---
And the final comment usedd in the meme format just really reveals your own stance on it rather than use it for what it's meant, the final frame is used for the final well thought counter argument not just your mind fulfilling your own fantasy. (Retail is better pah)
---
Sunk cost. Cant transfer. spent months on my chars. On RPPVP server. Cant transfer to RP server or PVE server. only low pop PVP and that would mean I had to convince my friends to go.
---
and reducing enemy power and armor, 2 over time heals and thorns and tank never loose agro. 5 man heal...
---
I regret not doing this.. I never considered the time it takes up and it's only doubled with corpse runs
---
&gt;but that doesnt matter since most of horde is braindead
---
Should be easy then
---
Yeah I dont. Unless I get an orb. Some people are fine with it and some aren't. I'm not forcing people to give me orbs. I'll see someone posting "lf tank strat live" for a long while and I offer to tank for the first orb. Some take it, some dont.
---
A lot of people wanted Classic because it gives them a chance to get back to the WoW they wanted. That desire is just as valid as the one to get Classic back.
---
My name is on that petition that was sent to Blizzard with Mark Kern, and I want Wrath back. I want to play a Paladin on the Horde again, finally get the opportunity to run Ulduar as current content, and really experience WoW as a competent player.
---
However, Classic+ has its appeal to me. There is a very easy way to get me to say yes to Classic+, and that is Horde Paladins. Bare minimum that would make me happy. I'm playing the role that I want (Tank) on a class that I hate playing (Warrior).
---
I think with Classic+, there MUST be the availability of things from other expansions. I don't want to stay on vanilla Azeroth for 10 years, so that means there should be the availability to have new zones. I don't want to play Warrior forever, so there has to be the availability of Horde Paladins/Alliance Shamans.
---
There must be new, non-vanilla content on the table to make Classic+ viable, and the potential for good ideas from other expansions to make their way into Classic should they meet the Classic design criteria/philosophy.
---
I paid about 5g for mine and loved it, it lasted about 12 levels. Very niche staff though, would probably only use it on priest.
---
Broken
---
why the fuck would you run from IF?
---
I don’t understand this argument. Just because someone finds something different from classic fun doesn’t mean they didn’t play classic. That doesn’t make sense.
---
Level 55 mage food and water is better than what is available at most vendors, and still saves people gold they would have spent at a vendor for the lesser food.
---
Also, portals have a reagent cost which I'm sure is factored in.
---
Are you using axes?
---
Rings are a good start - Blackstone from mara/tarnished elven from DM:n.
---
If you're raiding the onyxia necklace is amazing (+band of accuria is 2% hit from rag if you're lucky)
---
Ranged weapon from DM:e or LBRS gives 1% hit too and then you have boots from scholo either bloodmail or windreaver for another 1%. Chop and change.
---
For your 4 I'd go range, rings and neck if poss then chop n change as you get more upgrades? :)
---
Itemrack, create, new, "oh shit", bind to f, see horde, F.
---
Ok good then
---
Not everyone researches things in game. Some people only buy things off of the ah. Every player doesn't know every little thing about the game.
---
Nah its all good, they are just releasing every new content patch 1 month apart, its obviously not because they want to milk people for sub money. Its the players fault !
---
The guy who made this video had 43k honor in his last video. That was in week 1. For 43k honor in one week you will have done your fair share of ganking, camping and whatever "pvp". Rogues will always find their target.
---
&gt; Pantheon's progress had been insanely slow even with him as the lead.
---
The most recent game play video didn't instill me with much hope, sadly. I want so much for it to succeed, but it didn't look like any fun to play. I hope I'm wrong.
---
6000 people from the last 2 weeks with 37% of those being alliance. Meaning 2.2K Alliance were in raid logs in the past two weeks.  
---
  It's fair to say it's a decent representation of the population. However though a lot of Alliance are tired of being camped by Horde and just raid log now till BGs are out, so the open world difference is more noticeable.
---
Because no one here wants to see this low effort cringe garbage. Fuck off.
---
Int is probably best since you will be so mana dependent with consecrate and judgements.  Spiritual focus is always good as well.  If you are going to try tanking then you should definitely get improved threat from righteous fury.  Plate is not itemized for what you need so you won't find those combinations until AQ40 and naxx.  I guess there are a few plate blues from ZG that might be useful.  Quel'serrar would work for 1H mitigation while you wait for Thunderfury.  Fair warning: you will probably be flamed a lot by random people and it will be harder to find groups.
---
Goddamnit Anus-Tart
---
Got it today. Getting 360 crits at lvl29. Time to level and get wf. I know rock is best for 2h but wf looks too fun
---
Always gnomish then goblin. If only 1 then just stay gnomish. The reason people swap is to craft their own consumables (bombs).
---
They locked factions. If it got to like 55/45 horde would get locked for a while
---
Is there literally anyone pushing for post-Wrath Classic? I’ve not seen anyone.
---
This is just not the answer. The real problem is there's 4 times the player population compared to vanilla and no battlegrounds.  These two factors make for a nearly unplayable experience.
---
No neither do I.    
---
I’m assuming a lot of people here just don’t have friends so it’s quite a foreign concept to them.
---
Dude if you're a hunter in an established guild you're gonna get fed gear, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
peoeple actually *do* that quest? damn. Im always like "when am I coming back to BRD? probably never" and just don't bother.
---
I'd say 80% of mages charge for water to randoms, I happily pay for it so. Why should it be free?
---
Some people just wanna play oomkin and some raid guilds are cool with that!
---
I pay a gold for a port to Darn and you practically land in a moonwell. I find it more convenient than SW.
---
that's what i have:

---
That makes a lot of sense. I'm on Bigglesworth which is about 60/40 (but who really knows), definitely more Horde. As a Horde hunter, it's pretty tough to secure solo kills, and to do enough damage to get the majority of honor out of a kill. I usually run around in a 2-3 man party because of this. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something super obvious that was going to crush my honor farming progress.
---
Exactly. Most people are just playing the game and having fun. I really do fucking hate modern game culture: min max min max min max i dont play games to have fun I play to make money reeeeeeee!!! Like oh my God stfu please go outside and actually realize how ridiculous this all is.
---
People literally don't know how to just play a video game anymore
---
Nothing - ditched the server and moved on to a PVE one. I quickly learned that PVE servers have plenty of PVP, all you gotta do is flag yourself.
---
The way I see it Thunderfury is about 60g a day for the next 100 days or 6k. You need far more gold than most other people will so you need to get "greedy" or you will never have the matts ready. This isn't something that you can just hold off on because it is such an insanely high number you have to be prepping for it now.
---
I don't charge guildies for tanking but I hardly ever tank anything but strat live for guildies either. Before I had my epic mount I'd run everything I was offered and you can make 100g or so doing that for 8 hours a day. Now that tanks are geared and fewer are running things though I pick what I run and I reserve things, first orb in live then I get in the RR like everyone else for example.
---
Its dogshit.
---
Should be Gathermate2
---
That's not how this works.
---
Its a priest/mage on the same faction. They start a duel and just let the flag stay dropped while waiting for people to fly in. Once the target lands the mage polymorphs the target and waits for the priest to MC. Once the poly breaks the priest forces the mind controlled character to attack the mage partner thus losing the honorless debuff. The mage just sits there and free casts into the target until its dead giving 100% of the honor to the mage and priest.
---
The exploit lies in the creation of a situation that prevents counter play.
---
You should absolutely get something out of your time, if they dont like it find another tank simple.
---
That’s what I like to see
---
Depends on the group and it’s tough when groups aren’t on the same page. At least as a tank. If your healer likes a slow steady pass but you have a zoom zoom mage it’s frustrating for everyone.
---
It’s not that rare. Also a rival guild on my server has one dps warrior and like 5 rogues. It’s not that crazy. My raid has had mageblade drop 6 times already.
---
That's just basic echo-gnomics
---
You only need 6% with axes which would be lionheart+ satyrs bow with 3%hit scope. If you switch to swords then add ony neck + 2 hit rings (blackstone and tarnished or 2 tarnished) thats 9% ezmode
---
Your guildmates sound really entitled. Ofc you should get something out of it if there are no drops for you
---
I might be late to the party with this one but here it goes... Is it worth switching to ele from enh in early 40s if I mostly have enh gear  (Herod stuff)?
---
&gt;Release TBC then as both near end of life launch WoW 2 and consolidate the player base
---
Thats impossible, as the games are almost entirely different.
---
I would prefer to have 2 versions, one old wow which is more hardcore and tuned similarly to what we on classic, and one single-player RPG or whatever retail currently is.
---
I don't see there being a middle ground
---
Monday for EU and Thuesday on NA.
---
What do you mean?
---
This is precisely why it's an exploit. There is no pvp response available.
---
The design of duels is being abused to create a situation in which there'd is no pvp counterplay. Once mc'ed inside a duel allies of that player cannot dispel or heal him. There is no pvp solution which what precisely makes it an exploit.
---
I don't hate blood elves because they're feminine, I hate blood elves because they don't fit in aestethically with the rest of the horde at all. I just don't find it believable that high-class elves would work with green slave aliens and cow-people who live in tree and mud-huts. Also if they have the technology to build fancy stuff, wouldn't the other races work together to build better houses and stuff?
---
You can attach it to Aspect of the Hawk and Monkey since ideally you want to switch out to something anyway and they’ll both still serve as cancel Cheetah binds if you don’t have the mana for Hawk/Monkey.
---
They do! And when someone body pulls an extra pack or a patrol comes by they can innervate the mage and toss extra heals if needed.
---
Gonna come back when BGs released?

Why does BiS not seem universally agreed on for some classes? I look up info on BiS for warrior (prot/fury) and different sites suggest different items. I get that human/orc reason but I still see other differences in suggestions
---
43 mage is good for gy group farm
---
&gt;Alliance also has paladins and in many people's opinions, superior PvP racials.
---
What does Alliance have that's better than WotF and hardiness?
---
Lmao this is terrible reasoning. "what do you mean you don't want to get stabbed in the eye with a hot rod? Look buddy this opportunity is never going to happen again, you need to savor it!" Just because something is unique doesn't mean it's worth savoring. Congrats if your 60 and you can enjoy the ride, try telling this same shit to anybody in their 50s.
---
Relog. It’ll be there.
---
and what if I want to play Cataclysm?
---
Was it a good expansion? No, I don't think so.
---
But.... I really enjoyed arena in Cataclysm, which was the only time I ever did arenas in WoW. Disc priest were just fun in that expansion with the addition of lifegrip.
---
hur hur horde es poo poo
---
Gotta take inspiration from somewhere
---
Blizzard may decide this is an exploit and take action but "preventing meaningful counterplay" is something you just made up.  A lvl 1 being killed by a lvl 60 has no meaningful counterplay but it's not an exploit.  Rooftops are considered an exploit because they abuse geometry to evade guards.  That has been their consistent standard.
---
LOL. What a classic neckbeard you are to associate complaining with women and periods.
---
There’s a mage in argual alliance I think it’s zeestrup who gives out free water food and portals in iron forge daily. He even makes lower level food and water if you aren’t above 45
---
I'd consider 60/40 still in the realm of balanced. I feel Heartseeker Horde and Stalagg Alliance are the ones this post is targeting. Not trying to take away from your opinion though!
---
God tier shit post
---
No you're just wrong with a fundamental misunderstand of what an exploit is.
---
The exploit isn't cc'ing someone until they are worth honor.
---
The exploit is abusing duel design mechanics to create a situation in which thre is no counterplay available (heals or dispels from friendly players).
---
No glancing blows. Just an all or nothing on the hit. It's still 3% hit.
---
Libram of constitution before phase 2. I never have to farm a single gold again. Maybe next time lads :^^^)
---
Them reserving one item does not equal to you having zero chance of loot
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Forgive me if I'm wrong but im pretty sure the hit scope is only ranged hit
---
Best thing I've seen was an enchanter running a script where you would whisper him a certain codeword and he (or his script) would instantly reply to you with a new list of like different available slots or different enchants and what mats to get, or what fee he asks. So you'd have a tree of different menu's all with their own triggers and stuff.
---
It was amazing, it felt like an old school calling machine!

And stop once you see a Netflix logo. The new seasons ruin the show.

I will quote myself from another thread
---
"Alliance is not even a faction in TBC.
---
Horde already has arguably better racials for both PvP and PvE, but alliance at least have paladins, and some very strong geographical advantages (Ironforge OP), and generally easier access to EK content. Also having either shaman or paladin makes faction specific metas, casters are better on Alliance. Melees are better on horde with windfury, nefarian is easier as alliance (no random windfury oneshotting your tank) etc.
---
In TBC all of that goes straight out the fucking window, horde gets paladins (which are superior rets compared to alliance) and alliance are left with nothing. No more geographical advantages in Outlands, you think world pvp is bad now? LOL. Wait until flying is added on a tiny continent with way shorter travel time, and very specific farming spots. Have fun! At least you can do a few less daily quests/hcs for your rep I guess as human.
---
TBC is a joke when it comes to faction balance, and thats where faction servers started on retail. there is a reason why Blizz had to rework the racials and give Humans the most OP PvP racial  in wrath. There is also a reason why TBC private servers are ghosttowns compared to Vanilla and Wrath.
---
It simply doesn't hold up the way vanilla does, and Wrath is just better retail I guess.
---
TBC is awesome for 3-4 weeks when there a shitton of content to do, but then it runs out of steam real fast. Then you are stuck in Shattrath waiting for summons everywhere, or you just fly up in the air and click on auto-run. in the direction you want to go."
---
Emoji nazis, 2019 gaming ladies and gentlemen.
---
'Battlegrounds' only 'delay' the problem until people get the rank gear they want (within their available time), after that they only need to maintain Rank 3 (for the discount), which is trivially just world pvp ganking/griefing as they are now. Once battlegrounds have fulfilled their purpose for everyone who likes ganking/camping as they do now (i.e. they're geared) they'll just return to doing exactly what they're doing now pre-battlegrounds. Volume has nothing to do with it. Even if you had a 1/4 of the player density the players who would make your life miserable without battlegrounds will still do it post gearing up.
---
I mean, the Alliance alienated them in WC3:TFT, so they picked new allies. As for not fitting the Horde’s tribal, shamanistic aesthetic, neither do the mad scientist Forsaken.
---
Seems odd. Do you not have warlocks?
---
You don't know what meaningful counterplay means.
---
The level one could summon the help of other high level players to come help them. That's the pvp solution.
---
Abusing duel mechanics to create a situation where there is no practical pvp alternative is an exploit.
---
The abuse of the duel mechanic is preventing anyone (including friendly players that could heal/dispel) from being able to come up with counterplay. That is an exploit.
---
There are some builds that are equivalent to others, and plenty of alternatives for each piece of gear. 
---
Sometimes and item is just so hard to get (dozens or hundreds of hours + luck) or so expensive that people don't recommend it even though it's better, you have different PVP/PVE "BiS" items as well.
---
You are halfway correct.  The quantity won't happen again, but I'd imagine the quality will drastically increase.
---
That's your experience. I was on a rppvp server vanilla through tbc and got hassled non stop. Each server has its own culture. There was a bad imbalance on that server and so me and friends moved and had a much better experience. But again, classic servers are more densely populated. On my current PvP server the alliance are a bunch of cheap shot bastards. Such is life.
---
At 54 you can get everything up to Vault I think
---
I've got good news for you: they've been out for twelve years now.
---
Go with the 2h. Parses are based on bosses so youll be lower in the logs but youll probly be doing a lot more dmg on trash packs speeding up the raid.
---
Is it possible to have horde and alliance characters? It says I can’t have them on the same server but can I play on two different servers?
---
*Destroyed by facts and logic.*
---
Also,

Legolas

Legoläs
---
Someone posted earlier about observed player numbers, and the PVE server populations, while heavily alliance are much smaller then the PVP servers. So the alliance on PVE servers is not going to save you from long queue times. Also cross realm was a thing from vanilla, and it was never all realms, there were groups of realms.
---
Believe it or not, if Blizzard thought stealth was an exploit they probably wouldn't have put the potions in the game... or ya know the entire rogue/druid classes
---
Fuck bloodelfs
---
Too many min maxers in that game, Elmer Fudds dead zones makes him unplayable, taz’s hit box is way too big, and bugs medical racial “what’s up doc” is op as a healer. do not recommend playing
---
wPvP isn't toxic.
---
Farming and camping lowbies minding their own businesses is toxic. The moment I hit 60 I went to booty bay, farmed lowbie horde for an hour and got it out my system. Done and done.
---
I think the disconnect in the community on wPvP comes from the fact it's drawn and obvious line between casual gamers and those who have more time to invest.
---
With that being said I don't think being a casual gamer should warrant the fact you have to stay away from PvP servers.
---
Some people can't grind 35 levels through dungeons, being punished by the community for choosing to quest can simply be demoralizing.
---
Haha get fucked you spy abusing fuck.
---
Emerald Dragons (where all 4 spawn at the same time, and wiping your enemy gives you a 15 minute clear run at the boss), and AQ40 opening will be much better than this.
---
Near 100%.
---
It IS a serious violation because it scans everything in your RAM you agree to it in the TO'S. This is what they had to do to take down bottling forever and dish out banwaves.
---
I don’t care if mr tough guy hordes think I’m a coward for having a better play experience on a different server. Never mind that there was no way to know Heartseeker was going to be an Alliance favored pvp server by day 3 when I transferred, some people will always be dissenting voices
---
One day there were two level ones spamming trade and /y with names like “Allyrcowards” so it’s been pretty amusing 
---
As for pvp, since the faction specific xfer there’s actually been a decent amount of Horde. Usually 2 rogues camping boats or docks, killsquads in EPL/Burning Steppes etc

Why don’t they show the player base as a percentage on the character creation screen? I mean, blizz could have limited 45-55% on horde/alliance per server and made PVE servers able to be faction imbalanced. I know players would either have to wait to create a character or move to another server but at least it isn’t wasting 5 days played to find out your server is totally unbalanced and you have nothing to do but make a new character.
---
So my guild auctions off the onyxia hide bags.. bidding starts at 75g. They usually go for 200+ and they aren’t unique. We do split runs so we can get upwards of 800g a night if both raids get 2 bags. That’s just one raid team. We have another raid team that raids on different days and they split run and auction the ony bag too.
---
&gt;and what if I want to play Cataclysm?
---
If it comes at the cost of me not getting classic+, I don't want you to get Cataclysm. I'm sure you feel the same way about me not getting Classic+ if it comes at the cost of you getting Cata.
---
There are no other healthy population MMOs that use this style. I will staunchly defend this one against people who want another modern MMO but slightly different from the current ones. You have options, I don't.
---
Watching videos from servers like Skeram really reveals that paid server transfers ought to be a thing. That's the "measure" people are looking for: for their character not to be locked onto a shitty realm, an option that was in the original WoW.
---
I guarantee you that every single tank out there, is trying to do as much threat as he can. But if you overaggro me, there's not a damn thing i can do about it on taunt immune bosses and the problem will snowball out of control.
---
It's fine that you say that the tank needs to get fed threat gear and/or go fury prot (which requires a certain amount of gear) but that does not help the CURRENT issue.
---
If the tank can't do enough aggro now, you need to manage your threat, end of story.
---
ya no, healing druids a singular great example of how peoples complete perception of item crafting is just not even fully correct
---
(in case you where wondering stats and MP5 far far outweigh healing, yet bis suggestiosn involve heavily on healing over stats)
---
I use it because I kept getting corpse camped by multiple groups of rogues, and I didnt want to spend the gold on a repair bill by ressing
---
Just an observation...
---
The OP posted how he was struggling with mental issues but was happy with his accomplishment in wow, and bloodshot's response to his happiness is "yikes?" 
---
And you people are ok with that...do you have no empathy? What a joke.
---
Which would be literally the only reason my raid would take one along, but we still chose not to.
---
I ran around the bottom right of the map once trying to find an entrance. FML
---
I keep hearing that 1 priest with 4 mages is the fastest 5-man multiboxing team composition but I haven't tried it.
---
That's not really 'gear' per-se, it's just having a godly weapon on melee and enough health pool to live.
---
***
---
For a Rogue (as an example) there are very few 'upgrades' beyond the Perdition's Blade from  MC (it's pretty much Rank 14, or Nax) for a Dagger Mainhand.
---
No problem. Make some teleporters/bridges
---
True, just the neckbeard pserver champs who would rather kill servers.
---
Same. And sometimes you can get 2. And if you do split runs we can make over 800g in one night.
---
I agree that these specific scenarios are bullshit, the tank dosen’t need to agree to them. 
---
However, I do believe that him as an officer and a tank should want the best for his guild, which will be helping his healers and dps in dungeons. That sometimes means dropping personal farms or putting extra time into the game for others. 
---
Especially if the guild is pooling gear to the tank, then his reason for not needing anything from dungeons anymore is because what they achived as a guild in raids.
---
Mindful thot

1. DURING YOUR REGISTRATION FOR THE BATTLE.NET SERVICE YOU GRANT YOUR CONSENT TO THE FOLLOWING: WHEN RUNNING, THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT CLIENT MAY MONITOR YOUR COMPUTER'S RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) AND/OR CPU PROCESSES FOR UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY WITH WORLD OF WARCRAFT.
---
I personally hate the whole sci fi vibe of tbc and dont want it ever and would rather hop straight to wotlk
---
As a horde player I share your sentiment. I may get blasted for this but I'm extremely disinterested in the game right now. I spend 90% of my time playing wow... Watching Netflix... Waiting for prey to walk by, then kill them 3 times and go back to the spot watching Netflix. 
---
Running around is pointless, there's no alliance. BRM is pointless there are so many horde you get 2 honor per kill. I only find alliance in one spot and even then it's a few per hour-- somehow I managed to get into the 2nd or 3rd percentile doing this for ranking but dear God is it unbearable. Grinding is fine, PVP is fun, bit this isn't that. It's waiting. Sitting afk. Like a Venus fly trap. And it's the most efficient honor because people like me have pushed the outnumbered alliance to do exactly what you said, raid log. Which pushes people like me to do the same. 
---
Tonight I'm going to go home, sit in the same spot stealth afk on one monitor and play destiny on stadia on the other... And if I catch a flash of red I MIGHT be bothered to turn and sap it... Or I might just log out and quit ...
---
To this day I maintain that anyone who talks about how bad Barrens chat was did not experience Eversong Woods chat the day TBC came out, because that was pure hell.
---
what world pvp have you've done that wasnt people just overrunning other groups with more people.
---
Wait you raid tank as a pally?? How does it go? I'm not joking when I say literally everyone on this sub has told ppl it's impossible to raid tank as pally so I'd legit love to know more!
---
Except that's the whole point... Retail crowd still HAS retail. Going down the line into further and further expacs is really just making it creep closer to retail... When there is already retail.
---
Considering all the pvp realms besides like one or two are horde dominated...
---
You do realise it was heavily nerfed like.. a day ago. Right?
---
Agreed.
---
That's how lazy he is.  He could make way more money.  Even if he doesn't want the money he could donate it to charity or whatever, but hes too lazy to hire someone to do it for him so someone else profits.
---
I said it would be about even. The mages in my guild arent top dps atm and I dont know the exact numbers. But let's say that our mages pull 300 dps on average. That's 1500 dps with 5 mages. A boomkin with relatively the same gear could probably comparatively do about 250 dps. Add in 4 mages with an extra 3% crit, which I would say adds maybe 10-15 dps. That totals to around....well 1500. Of course these numbers are completely made up but I think they can be roughly accurate.
---
Point is, a single boomkin is certainly viable with the right raid set up, and definitely not a bad thing to carry with. Plus you get back up heals, battle rez, stealth, other utility, and someone else even mentioned less loot competition.
---
People try to min max this game so hard now, but they dont realize there are options that cna work just as well if not slightly worse than the optimal.
---
Right, I just meant that weapon skill for melee is slightly better because of the glancing blow thing.
---
Im probably one of the only tanks that actually does dungeon runs in my guild. I think it depends on two things, is it a 3 man group and do you actually need the ore/ench mats. If its 3 man, I think its more ok to ask for something since the other guys likely asked for something specific too, and they arent just going to the hell of it. But if its a full group, there are probably 1-2 people who are just going to help, not actually get something specific as well. Next, if you actually need the ore/mats, I think its fine to ask for that specifically in a guild run. But if you just want to sell, again, the first opinion rears its head.
---
You could make a teleport or FP to get up to tempest keep or  netherwing. The rest really doesn’t need flying as they had to design it with people going 60-70 doing quests
---
When Classic TBC launches they would just have the option opened to move to a TBC server. Once they see how many have moved, then they would probably consolidate the Classic Vanilla servers. Then, you can transfer your character to TBC whenever you want, but not back.
---
Not true. We do it for the ranks because that's how the system works. "Nochanges" amirite?
---
Nailed it, definitely. Lol
---
Ayyyy
---
Zing!
---
I mean if you joined a server like Asmons expecting it to not be ran by neckbeards, you're a damn fool.
---
Why do you think faction change is inevitable? I think it will never be in classic.
---
It isn't normalised, there was a post regarding this a few weeks ago that involved testing etc.
---
I'm not upset. I'm talking about it in a place that's here for that purpose.
---
This is what I don't get, why are people *so upset* that people want to talk about the game and the aspects they do and don't like?
---
I'm not "upset" that people want to run around in big groups and have zero challenge PvP. I think it's boring. I'm not "upset" that people only want fights they can never lose, I think it's sad and pathetic.
---
Talking about something is not being upset over it.
---
What actually happens is that if you enable a starter subscription, and then buy a normal subscription for classic, it takes 24h before it updates.
---
Your account appears to be a starter, but it actually isn't. After the 24h pass, it works as expected.
---
I'm pretty sure AAP is now updated to 60, but I've been using it and it seems kind of sloppy. I just got told to go to wetlands and it wanted me to pick up a quest that I couldn't get unless I completed a prereq in loch modan that it never told me to do. There have been a few times where similar things have happened that make it a bit frustrating and less efficient, but overall it still feels better than what I did on my first 60, which is just using questie and going to high density quest areas until they felt too difficult.
---
I am actually a proponent of classic +, because its the closest thing we can have to keeping the game "pure". TBC has some good things, but also a lot of bad. But 2 versions of WoW would be ideal imo.
---
And the argument becomes if they are gonna do TBC, then, why not do Wrath, and then why not do Cata, MoP, WoD etc..
---
Like where should it stop, and why? I don't like wrath. I think TBC is okay-ish, but then suddenly people feel nostalgic about other expansion. 
---
I would use the argument that TBC, Wrath, Cata and all the other expansions already exists on retail, more or less unchanged. While vanilla was almost entirely removed/reworked in cata. And then just cut it there
---
I've gotten even better news. The balance is already fucked hard.
---
&gt; I think a lot of people are learning that phase 2 was not going to be a stroll in the park, and I hope for some they realize that pve servers are the place for you. 
---
You very clearly play on the favored side in pvp lmao
---
You do you man. But I've been there before.. I was lying to myself, are you sure you're not?
---
I made it a personal task to find out what the hell was in there. I'm still not sure what I found. :\\
---
Druid my guy
---
And a Satyr for the Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest (iirc)
---
brah... you forgetting how OP human racials were in vanilla?!
---
Good news everybody! The designers are testing in live again!
---
I feel the same.. if they do tbc &gt; wotlk etc I will just stop probably because that means the game has a END DATE. With classic plus, it doesnt.
---
YOU SEE MOVIE NOW. VERY HARD WORK CHINESE MAKE MOVIE FOR YOU. ENJOY NOW OR WE KILL YOU WHOLE FAMILY.
---
The game client has API that tells you exactly how much damage reduction occurs for x amount of armor. It's trivial to input every single possible armor value and be told exactly how much damage reduction will take place (and that includes scaling armor amount and level). After that when you've done the math and know exactly how hard you should be hitting (without damage reduction) it's just a case of combat logging enough instances (of damage done vs target) to do statistical analysis, determining via process of elimination and confidence level (which increases the more log data you get).
---
True but at the same time...if I’m making more than enough money than I’ll ever need...do I take more time out of my day to stress/navigate making even more money? 
---
I get the theory of “Never having too much money” but if you’re comfortable in life and you enjoy doing what you do, what’s the point?
---
Don’t advertise it without having it.
---
Nice to see some other old r14s still out there kickin around.
---
If I get ganked repeatedly I just go take a shower or get laundry started or get some food etc, by the time i come back im chilling to res.
---
Yeah, but if they were to change that, I would also keep shamans/paladins faction separated. Which would over raid tuning.
---
A remake of TBC without all the "bads" would be interesting, but then they might as well do that with classic first anyways.
---
Hate it in the moment, remember it fondly, never wish to revisit it.
---
The classes themselves were just straight up better though. I only played rogue and resto druid to be fair both were much more fleshed out in BC than in vanilla.
---
have you actually seen blood elf male models without chest armor though? the entire male half of that race must spend all day at the gym.
---
You weren't encouraging him to get help. That's not what encouragement looks like. You may have intended encouragement, but, from my perspective, I inferred condescension and derision. 
---
Now, don't get me wrong, it was a single sentence post. I know I over-inferred.
---
When I was dealing with suicidal thoughts and depression, people, strangers especially, loved to tell me to just work harder and stop doing the things I was still enjoying and be more productive so I could have more time and energy to be productive. It doesn't help. Again, the guy is seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. He doesn't need us in here telling him to get his shit together.
---
Sorry I didn't realize we were getting our tinfoil hats out. I'm ready now.
---
That was pretty nuts, I hate fighting against my own class most of the time
---
I often run around with nifty stop watch and the gnomish cloaking device equipped in hostile zones pop them both and dip. Not many classes use or have track invisible.
---
Perfect choice
---
Dear god you're pathetic. Everyone with an opinion other than yours is "butthurt".
---
Some of us can very clearly see the negative impact on world PvP these addons are having and would be happy to see them changed. That's it. 
---
The only people I see acting like crying children around here are the ones screeching about how PvP happens on PvP servers blah blah blah. 
---
Grow up mate.
---
Because Blizz has managed to let some servers get fucked up by not doing anything to encourage or showcase faction ratio on pvp servers.
---
And if they let their servers get to the point of 80/20 or down in that area, people will just simply quit.
---
Druid probably. They level easily, they have the best escapability in pvp, they can tank dungeons (easy to find groups), and they're so rare finding raid slots is easy. If you have low time investment, best to expect to heal in raids.
---
Druid with the added note that you can't do any of it at the same time. You have to actively change gear and talents to really get the full range of the druid lifestyle.
---
Living the dream!
---
Yep Druid or shaman. Recommend Druid as they they are much more capable as tank but I have heard Of some limited success as a shaman tank
---
My account is a full account, I can trade with any other player except for the one in the image.
---
Anyway, what do you mean a "starter subscription"?
---
I'm horde on heatseeker. It is annoying to deal with larger groups than your own but I manage just fine and we're something like 70% alliance. If I get ganked by 10 mans I leave that area and find azone with less people or I band together with other horde in the area. It's annoying but I agree with the post, it'll be over in a few weeks and we can all sit in que's and never leave org except to raid again.
---
I'm sorry to inform you,  but orcs and night elves have the most NSFW art by a large margin
---
&gt;I mean, the Alliance alienated them in WC3:TFT, so they picked new allies. 
---
Stop spreading this lie. Garithos was from Lorderon. The Forsaken are the undead people of Lorderon. Blood Elves literally teamed up with the faction of humans that persecuted them.
---
"real feel of pvp" shut the fuck up, putting on auto walk and dying 10 times to a raid while trying to enter BRD isn't some exciting journey of bare survival.
---
My blood elf’s name was ChadSexington.
---
You bastards make my basilisk grinding a fing nightmare. 
---
Fuck.  U.   I’ll get ya later once I hit 60 though. 
---
It's not that bad a shadow priest as long as you time everything properly
---
I’ve played this game for thousands of hours over years and years. Every single character I’ve played has been Alliance. 
---
Blood Elves made me want to switch factions.... but I didn’t. 
---
Great story, I know.
---
I haven't done the math, yes they were good in vanilla, but are they better than windfury?
---
Also some people said in the TBC podcast thread that the human passive became shittier in TBC when it was changed to expertise instead of + wep skill or whatever it is now.
---
When's this come out
---
Only people like me? Only? I think you’re vastly underestimating how annoying you are, lol.
---
Idk I’m siting at 4850 hp unbuffed with 23ish crit and exactly 1k ap without improved BS.  And for the sake of argument we’re talking about BGS so it’s safe to assume he’ll have some buffs.
---
Supply and demand
---
Horde on Deviate Delight.
---
It's a lot of fun, regardless. There's a lot of playful banter. The alliance outnumbers the horde with more active PVPers for sure, but for the most part it hasn't affected my play experience to the point where I want to quit. There are some areas of the world I don't frequent quite as much, but our server isn't that large anyways. 
---
If I had a choice all over again, I'd probably pick a PVE server.
---
No one will struggle with BWL
---
Oh well the video from skerum going into BRD is spot-on accurate for stalagg also. Not even a "it's like that when it's bad", it's like that all the time. I've taken to running to BRD during off-hours to log off in-dungeon for grouping later and I still die 5-8 times reaching the portal.
---
Last night the horde had a raid successfully holding ground INSIDE Iron Forge. They set up half way between the bank and the mystic ward (to gank people taking mage portals).
---
Anyway, I totally understand your reason for leaving, but it is a shame because it makes it worse.
---
Mate you might not see this but I love your podcast. Every time I have to go on a 2 hour drive or longer ( happens pretty often) I put an episode on and enjoy the show. Thank you for doing this!
---
PS: Hopefully you can do another addiction related episode, as I feel that it went really well and a lot of good points were brought up.
---
Ask yourself what it is you want to do.
---
Do you want to tank?
---
Do you want to heal?
---
Do you want to push out big dick dps?
---
Do you want to farm gold easily?
---
Do you want to have little struggle finding a group?
---
Do you like melee or ranged?
---
I hope they make some changes to BC before they release it, or go in a completely different direction.
---
Yes, I also think the raid attunements were really good in TBC.
---
[Just look at this structure, its great](https://external-preview.redd.it/s0H6w9l3cba_rcGKegbGUJjs9myhxCsSj1wxo-9XF-U.jpg?width=1024&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e46c892d192084f3c19f8e7d63d5dc99e486124a)
---
But, even with a lot of good things in TBC, I also think it adds a lot of really bad things as I mentioned above.
---
Shots fired

&gt;&gt;/in 1 /script SetCVar("AutoLootDefault", 0)
---
What does that part do?
---
This is great work thanks, moved servers frpm Flamelash too based on this post and definitely agree the vibe on Bloodfang is much more ally friendly.
---
Lol because theres often 10-20 Horde at the gates of IF too.
---
Heh new players are awesome.  Watching them experience new things that we've known for years and learning is cute.
---
Warlock
---
"Syouck my ass"
---
Most people I've talked to feel that TBC showed warning signs of the times to come, wrath is when it started, cata is when the game completely transformed.
---
Just based off popularity there's no way Cata would get put through. WotLK I don't think there's enough active resistance against it if blizzard already gets lazy and pushes TBC.
---
Does that mean you do have BS up but not the extra amount of imp BS? What weapon do you have? Maybe if you have something like Demonshear the damage difference between MS Demonshear and the BT isn't that big.
---
But the difference of BRE + MS is day and night to a Bloodthirst crit.
---
Lol yas
---
Every single one of these posts are from people who don't have to deal with this.

https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=1201
---
Quest here says there's an uneasy truce. Do you have a quest somewhere else contradicting that?
---
I'm on a high pop pvp server and today I woke up at 5.30am to get online so I could quest and level. The past 3 days I've managed to get half a level at 55 (not enough time to do dungeons on an evening) but today i managed 2 and a half levels just questing and farming mobs, hardly any douche bags killing me and no one corpse camping me. So starting early seems to be the best option. Evenings are just waaaaay to busy to quest or level unless you're doing dungeons.
---
Variations of Sephiroth, too lol

I find it hard to believe GFPP recipe has gotten so high. Its quite easy to farm considering it drops from LBRS.

Don't you even dare to have fun. That's not allowed in 2019 WoW
---
It goes back to a 5 second CD after the first time it's used post zoning.
---
That's due to there being objectives that helped your faction in places like Eastern plaguelands and hellfire peninsula. PVP had a place to go, despite being wpvp; it's not just roaming premade gank squads crushing everything they cross and controlling every FP.
---
Uhh should someone tell him or should i?
---
I was Pillowfighta
---
Hey mate, I definitively do see it! I really appreciate the kind words and thanks so much for listening to the show. Sadly, with the show ending soon I won’t have the time for too much more content, but I’m glad to hear you enjoyed what we did have the time for in the past :)
---
Love it
---
I certainly hope not.
---
The strategy there is: wait for someone on Fight Club or Taladril or Defcamp to tell me what to do.
---
As a member of the Horde I would buy the shit out of that toilet seat!
---
not really. majority of Alliance players on pve realms are not that into pvp like most horde players on pvp realms
---
I'm listening.
---
Remember in vanilla our server (just like in classic) was 70% ally and 30% horde. Bc evened it out quite nicely. I don't think they should have give alliance shamans and hordes pallies though.
---
....there’s a moonwell in SW?????
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
Best decision of my leveling life was to slap on whatever int gear I had and swap to ele at 40. You can probably afford to patch in some AH greens on the cheap to get that mana pool beefy, and a shield is highly advised to tank you up for the lost armor of going basically pure cloth.
---
Cross realm BGs are not limited to PVP servers. Hence why I was asking. As far as the census data went from before they broke the addon, it was almost a 50-50 split for Alliance/Horde across ALL realms.
---
Er, no, the Forsaken at that point (Blood Elf campaign of TFT) were Scourge beholden to Arthas. It was after the first mission of the subsequent Undead campaign that the Forsaken under Sylvanas broke free of Scourge control, began an insurrection against the two factions of Scourge (one under the control of the Dreadlords, one under the control of Arthas’ regent, Kel’Thuzad). 
---
During this insurrection the Forsaken briefly allied with Garithos just long enough to retake Lordaeron/the Undercity, then wiped him and his surviving followers out.
---
Fair warning, if you're trying to dps as a druid, be ready to get turned down alot. If you respec to healer/tank though, you will be welcome to most groups.
---
Source: I'm a feral dps, and that won't change anytime soon.
---
Haven’t seen this one before..
---
This reads like a copy pasta
---
He could employ someone who he wants to get money, let them manage the whole thing.  I'm sure there is people in his stream who can video edit and would love for the opportunity. Instead its someone random.  Again if he doesnt want the money why not use it for donations to a charity.
---
but now mc is just 2 shower :/
---
I think you will be surprised. 
---
BWL was the guild destroyer after all.
---
I genuinely laughed out to myself lol. Thanks
---
If it didn't feel like a fucking embargo on an entire aspect of the game, I don't think people would bitch as much. The amount of pvp that completely suffocate zones is very demoralizing.
---
Because they now have a common enemy in the Scourge. That's a huge part of why the BEs and Forsaken are so chummy in TBC.
---
If not mistaken a starter subscription is a trial one. The one offered for retail. If the player you are trying to trade enabled it, and then bought an actual subscription, it will take 24h before he can be traded &amp; chatted
---
In the park
---
Yeah, it's in the park, northwest corner.
---
Can confirm, 30/0/21 and no one cares in this content about missing mana tide.
---
How to hell did you end up commenting Druid.
---
1. New to classic
---
2. I don’t have too much time
---
And you seem to be confusing this with playing every role Classic has to offer, which isn't the same as:
---
3.  I just want a class that lets me pretty much do everything classic has to offer.
---
The Correct answer is a Warlock. Good at PvP, Goot at PvE, good class Quests and a companion that makes it easy to level. Wanted in raids but not over played as Mages, still good at gold farming, moderate skill ceiling. Compared to one of the highest skill ceiling classes to play, the Druid.
---
Nope.
---
Tbc pvp was only difficult if you didn't play a druid/priest/hunter
---
I wanna hear it too!
---
I tried doing BRD but my group kept ragequitting cause they couldn't get there
---
&gt;If the tank can't do enough aggro now, you need to manage your threat, end of story.
---
yeah no shit, but that shouldn't be an issue right now unless you're like a brand new raiding guild or just killing rag
---
Peoplw who call everything they dont like "toxic" are snowflakes

And now we will see "Okoomer" boomkins running around in game lol

I started tracking when DM water came out using a custom addon I wrote and after something like 1500 tips logged my average tip is about 1.1g per trade.

Can you talk to other people?

---
Not OP, but I'm looking for it rn. Is it 30/0/21? Wowhead calls it Moonfury/NS
---
I'm sad to hear it, but I thank you for what you have done and the hours you put into the show, the people you brought in, and all the interesting topics you brought up. Even though the show is almost over, it will always have a special place in my heart! GG!
---
I have, and I'm horde.
---
&gt;Most people I've talked to feel that TBC showed warning signs of the times to come, wrath is when it started
---
I think really started changing in TBC, from the get-go, and people will notice it immediately this time around. The addition of flying and summoning stones will make the world smaller instantly. Shattrath has portals to basically everywhere you need to. Mages and warlock are obviously somewhat devalued for that reason, even the addition of 65 water/food being sold by standard vendors will reduce the social aspect.
---
I played TBC and vanilla on both retail, and private servers somewhat recently. And TBC feels extremly small in comparison, and I think are in for a real shock, if blizz takes that route.
---
Dude I'm not even seeing it anymore NOW. The first 1-2 days were insane, seeing huge raids on boats and shit. Now it's like groups of &lt;10 mostly besides at Hillsbrad.
---
Hey cool
---
Somewhat off-topic. but Azshara was one of my favorite zones in vanilla WoW.  It seemed like a zone that Blizzard forgot, and as a result, there were not many quests there so most people just ignored the zone.  The only people I ever seemed to run into were gold farmers.  I used to go there sometimes to farm felcloth and spend a little quality solo time.
---
No. It's just RNG. I think there's a flat 5% chance for a pickpocket to resist. 
---
I had a really good streak last night where I pickpocketed for like 30 minutes straight without any resists. I don't think I'll ever get that lucky again. 
---
Then today, I pickpocketed and it failed within five minutes of starting the run, so I vanished, which failed, prep'd and vanished again, which also failed, so I died.
---
RNG giveth and RNG taketh away.

Ive literally never seen a mage selling water, most of the time I go to ironforge i see mages giving it out for free

Don't forget spell crit aura
---
I dunno man, I realize they signed the contract lining them up for hell but my playing the game ruining it for others doesn't feel not-toxic. It's not like the majority of my time is spent fighting other PvPers like in BGs.
---
I just spent 2 hours camping fresh 60s trying to run into BRM for dungeons. Most died to my group 3 times before they got inside the doors.
---
So your solution is to have a thousand people “trust each other”?
---
You do realize the game doesn’t end with MC and you are stuck with the people you gear out for months, right?
---
Pool cues. I want them forming well structured pool cues
---
Good work!! Keep it up :)
---
That's the price you pay for massively outnumbering the other faction during wpvp.
---
In AV maybe. Horde dominates WSG.
---
This seems low effort. The post compares Horde to toilets, so the analogy would be “what does a toilet do?” As far as I know, toilets don’t shit on people. A more thought out comeback would be along the lines of:
---
“I get it... we have to deal with whiny, Alliance shits all day!”
---
Yea no. I literally logged off last night because i couldnt go more than 5 mins in ungoro before getting killed by alliance.
---
Why wouldn't you? Place looks awesome and we all made a point of heading in to check it out while leveling in Duskwood.
---
How many of that 51% of alliance pvps though? I'd wager 1/3-1/2 of their population
---
How come that my Power Word: Shield is silenced when I get Shield Bashed, Counterspelled, or Kicked while casting a Holy spell? It's under Discipline and improved by Discipline talents.
---
Also, is it possible for Rogues to enter MC on their own and mine the Dark Iron deposits they can safely get to?
---
I mean you just sound stupid to be honest.
---
First of all I don't know if you've been checking the ranks/honor brackets for the people doing this but the very vast majority aren't even reaching the top 3 brackets of honor. 
---
Second, There is a clear difference between cleverly using mechanics and exploiting.
---
Chain cc'ing a player until their honorless buff falls is clever.
---
Absuing the design of duels to prevent interaction from players outside the duel and creating a situation in which there is no practical pvp solution or counterplay is an exploit.
---
Just like the boxes and roofs in goblin towns. This is an exploit.
---
Stv isnt that bad
---
First, I stand by my statement because this sub itself shows the fact that its horde dominated. Alliance wouldn't be bitching so much otherwise. Second, check three different census' and you'll get three different answers. They just aren't accurate.
---
A lot of us don't give a shit what you and others think. 
---
These addons don't negatively impact anything, they are apart of the game. They add depth. 
---
Go fucking play hello kitty island adventure where you belong.
---
What you think she looks like = what you wish she looks like
---
Cause you're a pathetic nerd
---
does a keyboard even have enough buttons to bind every rank of every spell AND consumable/trinket, or even a macro for some combo?
---
Funny that we have some similar and different tastes. I think robo chickens suck too but horses are kinda lame to me, I guess just because they're not very distinctive.
---
I do like the game, I just don't like running dungeons that I don't need gear from for now reason. There's a reason why in retail tanks &amp; healers get bonuses for doing dungeons from the game (gear, gold). It's to incentivize people to do those roles past when they no longer need gear from them. Idc if you charge or don't personally, I'm going to charge &amp; if someone doesn't like it and they ignore me I don't really give a shit because I don't NEED to group with some rando dps or healer.
---
Finish out wetlands and duskwood if you can, then I’d suggest spamming Gnomer and SM dungeon runs. Hillsbrad and Arathi are hell holes without many stand out quest rewards iirc. If you really want to quest I’d group up with as many ally’s as you can. The extra call outs and support will help a lot.
---
I believe it was a nod to the producer, Holly, was it not?
---
Dad server? Netherwind?
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Why would you assume how many people PVP? People would be rolling on a PVE server to make the r14 grind easier due to less competition if that's true. Which would increase the amount of people interested in PVP on the server. It's an unknowable statistic that you're basing off of bias.
---
Yeah if you dont like it you can wait another 15-30 mins for a tank. Dont matter to me. :)
---
&gt; Not everyone is so childish that losing makes a game unfun. 
---
Taking 40-60 minutes just to get to BRD and then have the group break up because they are sick of it or ran out of time makes it unfun. Again, clearly you play on the favored side.
---
So, quick answer, as I tend to monolog if I let myself. You're an orc, get axes. That will make your hit cap 6%. After achieving that, stack crit until you're raid/world buffed crit% is 35%. Then stack hit and crit in equal amounts, favoring hit. This is due to the crit soft-cap, you can look that up if you're curious.
---
man u one of dem virgins playing girls in game? c'mon man
---
Eight pummelers for MC + Ony in my experience, which is like 20-25 runs of Gnomer, at 25 minutes for 5 runs.
---
The wow community's obsession with elves is insane.
---
What a dick. Don't do it then.
---
hate to tell you this. All of it will be easy.  Naxx and the whole nine. Easy as pie. Raiding has changed a lot since back in the day.
---
You keep saying laziness, but I don't think you understand that some people don't think about money as much as you do.
---
This is like making fun of women on r/twoxchromosomes. It’s gonna get removed from ads blasted mods.
---
Idk why people echo this like it's an universal truth.  
---
Playing Horde on Razorgore despite being 40-60 in favor of Horde,and guess what faction has a raid parked in Gadgetzan all day? Or outside Morgan's Vigil?
---
Or Kargath? 
---
Or Thorium Point? 
---
Legit the only time you get peace from the fucking flock of  
---
gnome mages and warlocks is 5AM in the morning because they don't work jobs apart from  
---
farming honor so they don't exactly get up early.
---
Damn, you missed your last bottle?
---
&gt; PvP servers to promote actual fair and fun PvP encounters.
---
he learned that this is clearly not the case, which is fine and expected.
---
Shit, I got the 3 piece set as a tank just for improved thorns. Just took the extras off our Druid healer
---
huh? since when did toilets shit on people instead of it being the other way around.   
---
Sounds like you've got ADS or "alliance derangement syndrome"
---
Yeah...except I'm a prot warrior and nobody wants an undergeared prot warrior.
---
Because you need exposure to get issuses like blatant exploits addressed?
---
Double innervate looks awesome tho
---
Can you translate this to English for me haha, what is a DM Tribute run?
---
That's assuming the mage needs the mana, which they shouldn't. Innervating a target that won't go oom anyway = 0 dps increase.  
---
Also I hope you realize that "around half a percent increase in raid damage" is 400 dps or more. If any singular class or spec could give that much of an increase, you would ABSOLUTELY bring them. Moonkin aura is (surprise) about a 3% increase for 4 casters (gets better later with Fire Mages) which right now ends up being worth 40-60 DPS, depending on your caster's DPS.
---
Ayyyy Atiesh!
---
Currently questing in this area. Can confirm my map looks exactly like this
---
Ok i get that but i’m just going according to the terminology used in the game. 
---
Blood Knight = Blood Elf Paladin or Blood Elf Death Knight. 
---
There’s clearly one that makes more sense.
---
And I responded with the answer. It was two a.m. NO ONE was pvping. Everything on rattlegote shuts down around 10 pm server, the raids go away, the zergs, the fp campers. I had a lvl 60 gnome mage in ungoro just... watch me take the devilsaur to the ramp
---
Spending time on anything but world pvp in zergs in the open world is gonna get you killed within 1 minute of landing on any fp in my server on my faction. With high density population where you can't walk 10 meters anywhere before finding another 60, and roaming raids, the open world is just turned off as a function for the minority faction. I don't know about you, but I like my gameplay as varied as possible; one day I'll pvp and get some honour, another I grind arena for SGC, the third I'll go to Diremaul to farm for mats before raid-day. Except every function besides zerg pvp is a hellscape when you're playing in this context. You spend 20 minutes extra getting anywhere relevant for lategame content, and you're certainly not able to farm anything solo in the open world as your time is wasted compared to any form of instanced farming.
---
These are next level stuff. Absolutely amazing work. You seem to capture such strong emotions in the artwork. Bravo.
---
I found [Gloves of Holy Might] as a rogue.  They look pretty sick!  Wear or sell?  If you wear them, how long till they’re out classed by better gear?
---
Then they just port out to another zone as soon as you have a comparable or larger group to get back to 10v2 ganking.
---
I disagree about some of this. Making specs viable is nice, heroics were nice and the raids were good but flying changed the world WAY too much imo. It was fun sure but the change in roaming around the world was way too much. Also don't like the idea of badges for gear.
---
Yep I agree, I won't camp lowbies, but I will gank them (when there's no one worth honor around). Why? Because were they in my shoes, they'd camp me for an hour and spam go to retail
---
Grind rep for two days when AV comes out, buy the offhand BAM
---
1136 runs gone to waste
---
He needs rank 1 and max rank fireball and frost bolt keybinds. Shift and alt are good tools.
---
The clique addon let's you bind mouse clicks to heals - would allow you to, say, shift click your own frame to bandage.
---
Opie and ringmenu are radical addons where you press a key and a ring of options pop up that you can then mouse over- making them good for consumes like resto pots, prot pots, and invis pots.
---
I could not stay near him long enough to check, unfortunately; but I highly doubt that is as all the rest of his gear is just BoE greens.
---
Gibblets is the name.
---
feral druids cant FF every mob. caster druid is better.
---
Power shifting makes it decent. Literally 100% uptime pumper and you’ll top the meters easily alliance side
---
Just wait. Once you hunker down and get one to 60, then have the gold to twink out all of the alts every 10 levels, it gets worse lol
---
Do you use W to move forward?  Wondering if I use W to move forward and I bind shift W to something what happens when:
---
1.  I am standing still and press shift W
---
2.  I am moving forward by holding W then I tap shift
---
Gladly. Waiting 15-30 minutes is always preferable to wasting an hour or more in an instance with no chance to get loot :)
---
This bot just keeps compulsively posting dumb shit like this over and over. It's cool to just downvote everything he posts without even reading it.
---
Desolace.
---
Looks accurate.
---
I agree with what /u/writpig said. I can definitely recommend picking up a dreamweave vest, dreamweave gloves, red mageweave pants, and, at 46, a dreamweave circlet. They're created int/spellpower items that are very good for your level. I used them all the way up to 60.
---
Fish
---
&gt; These addons don't negatively impact anything, they are apart of the game. They add depth. 
---
&gt; They add depth. 
---
&gt; depth. 
---
Ahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha.
---
Good lord that's a new one. "Yeah this addon that makes the game way easier for me to play? Oh that adds depth!"
---
Thanks buddy, needed a laugh. Funny how the kind of person defending these addons is always exactly how you picture them. I think we're done here.
---
It depends. You cannot simply gather up 3 groups of mobs and aoe them all down. The tank keeping threat is a big issue, but lets say he has FRD or otherwise finds a solution to that problem. Then the healer has to keep the tank alive during all that damage. Fine, lets say the healer and tank are geared to the teeth, and this isn't an issue. Then you have to kill all the mobs before your dps go oom. AoE spells like Blizzard only do their full damage up to 10 targets. Every target past this point decreases the damage per mob by 10%. For example, lets say that Blizzard does 100 damage to 10 mobs. Then it will do 90 damage to 11 mobs, 81 damage to 12 mobs, 73 damage to 13 mobs, etc. Past a certain point, it will become very difficult to kill all of the mobs before mana becomes an issue. But lets say you stack warriors, so who cares about mana? Since Whirlwind only hits 4 targets on a 10 sec cooldown, you'll have a hard time killing all the mobs before the healer goes oom.
---
So you see, Classic is very different. In Wrath, it was not uncommon for me as the tank to gather up multiple rooms and, as I got geared up, multiple rooms worth of pulls into one giant stack that we aoe'd down. Was it fun at first? Hell yeah, especially coming from Vanilla and TBC. But it gets old after a while, and you stop caring about dungeons at that point.
---
That’s so much for chiming into the discussion with a personal attack instead of sharing an opinion.
---
Sorry, I got all turned around. For some reason I thought you were asking what the alliance would do without the horde lol.
---
A vocal minority that will keep growing once people realize there will be nothing to do once Naxxramas is on farm.
---
Fact of the matter is that Classic brought in a huge influx of subs. These people play Classic and are not interested in Retail. If Blizzard is not interested in 'continuing' Classic, then more people will be not interested in 'continuing' their subs.
---
As for TBC, it is a fail-boat. Just look at the private server populations. The TBC servers are probably like 1/10 to 1/20 of Classic in terms of population.
---
I logged in last night (lvl 59 alliance priest on horde dominated Yojamba) to heal a dungeon for a guildy. Hadn’t played for a week. Last time I’d been online at 6am and killed twice by 2 rogues in IF on the way to the flight master. 
---
The roving parties of horde surrounding every high level fp is just depressing. So much harder than the dungeon content to overcome. And I never see other alliance out on the world unless I’m spirit running. 
---
Anyway last night IF was about half as busy as Sat night should be but that’s still plenty of 
---
players on a high pop server. I flew to Lights Hope and there was only 1 afk horde on landing! Died 3 times moving NW towards Stratholm but near plaguewood i ran into another ally and actually had 15 minutes to quest peacefully. Was very zen. 
---
After Strat (I dinged!) we went to DM as a party of 5. There was a 2v4 skirmish (horde had the numbers like always) just inside the gate but our arrival tipped the odds and while my party members attacked the horde I was able to Rez my fallen allies without interruption or death. 
---
I can’t tell you how rare and happy this makes me as a holy priest. I HATE walking past alliance corpses. And yet it’s suicide if I stop most of the time. 
---
After 2 DM runs we all hearthed back to IF. I guess I was a few seconds slower than my party because when I loaded my party was close to the bank ... and I was stunlocked to death by an orc rogue in the inn (life as a clothie am I right?). 
---
But then 10-15 players with flares hunted him down from the inn to the mystic quarter. 
---
This is what makes me return. My deaths will be avenged.
---
Beautiful
---
Take my upvote and leave
---
Just implement the BC version.  You sign up for a specific dungeon and then theres a list of people.  You can either form a group or wait for someone to message you.
---
This post is glitching bad
---
The theory of 'never having too much money' is complete and utter bullshit.
---
Lol sounds about right
---
It's not the cc'ing that's the exploit.
---
It's abusing the ways duel are designed to prevent any interaction with the player by anyone other than the one in the duel.
---
You can still find a quiet corner of the zone. So what if the occasional 60 runs past and kills you? Just run back to your body and keep grinding.
---
While it is anecdotal evidence, on my alliance favored server (52-48) I have never seen wpvp where the alliance significantly outnumbered horde besides a few gank squads in winter spring. Brm, hillsbrad, you name it, there is always more horde. Horde players typically prefer pvp it seems at least on my server. Alliance players seem to prefer pve, because no one ever really groups up and fights.
---
I sincerely doubt that a large population of people going for r14 rolled on a pve server for easier gains. If you're going for r14, it's gonna be an insane grind no matter what
---
The comment I replied to and other comments here calling horde names imply this very heavily.
---
you need a TON of upgrades from raid? how is that nearly finished gear for the phase?
---
I always have a teleportation rune on me for when I ask a mage to port me. Only a few still ask for money
---
Happens on all servers. I’m so close to quitting if it wasn’t for my friendly guild. So sick of the toxicity this game breeds.
---
 „ p 2  „ p 2  „ p 2
---
Also 16 debuff slots instead of the 8 you got in early vanilla.
---
Thank you very much for the detailed answer.
---
I drive a Honda Type R Good Car thanks for sharing
---
You can have AV. That is historically all alliance gets over on us. I wont use the obvious reasons as to why that is. Other than that - get poo poo'd on
---
&gt; You provided a screenshot of Elysium after WhiteKidney split the server and took the majority of the player base with it.
---
The snapshot linked is from August 2017. 
---
The split happened in October 2017.
---
&gt; you really aren't good at logical reasoning, are you?
---
Are you?
---
wow less glancing blows too, what else brother. The hit% is far more important though.
---
But getting hit% gear isn't that hard. Especially in the current phase. LHH, Might gaunlets / edgemasters, blackcrow, tarnished elven ring 2x, or 1x and 1x blackstone, battleborn armbraces, onyxia neck, onslaught girlde, band of accuria. Those are items are not easy to get, but if you really put time into it, you can actually get them easy.
---
Now when it comes to racials, the human racial is supreme no question there. But if you compare 1% dodge with 5+ weapon skill it makes the difference not as high, since the dodge ratio also has a small but still some value. 
---
Additionally to that, is that you actually don't need to have 9% hit cap if you aren't the main tank. Neither if you pvp, so gotta factor those in the equation too.
---
let them have their queue thing man...its all they've got to be happy about
---
I mean the dude lives in an attic of his moms house even though he makes millions. If anything I prefer it over someone who is living in a penthouse eating lobster all day. Some people are chill with just living how they want to live. 
---
If he made 2000 a month I’m sure he’d be just as happy. No point in being jealous of someone for making a lot of money, the audience is the one paying for it, not you.
---
Don’t forget 10 paragraph woke rants on Reddit.
---
Is that the daily dose of Asmongold person?
---
Your last sentence is funny because it's as accurate if you replace TBC by classic.
---
TBC have arenas, classic doesn't, there is nothing challenging to do on classic as a PvP player.
---
Vanilla WoW favored Alliance in terms of population. Therefore with the new expansion, Blizzard made Horde racials objectively overpowered to try and balance things out. 
---
But with Classic WoW, the faction is already Horde favored, so a TBC re-launch would probably be 90-10 H/A split (as we see on private TBC servers).
---
Classic SFK has always been my favourite dungeon. This is a fantastic rendition.
---
Yep
---
Yes im sure thousands of alliance are trying to transfer to Skeram right now to help their 25% server pop bros. If only blizzard would let them. Tons of Horde are dying to get off too, the imbalance in their favor is a real motivator to have full guilds worth of people relocate. Boom bam.
---
How is IF closer than Loch Modan, then?
---
Yeah because not being able to see what your opponent is casting and making decisions based upon that, aka adding depth, is totally funny.
---
Fucking moron.
---
Be able to craft things in high demand. Like Iron Grenades or Goblin Sapper Charges. Buying and flipping is probably not worth it unless you have a lot of gold already. And you're familiar with the market. If you want to make easy sells put things up for fair prices but only one or two at a time depending on what it is so you don't tank the market. I make about 10g a day from just selling the grenades and sapper charges at level 43.
---
So not only is he too lazy to create his own content, but also to copyright strike the account?
---
Or am I missing something with streamers and their content.
---
Mana is a non issue in current content, if you still go oom with runes/pots as a mana intensive spec (i.e: Regrowth spec) then you/your guild is doing something very wrong
---
umm, why can't you raid with blizzard spe- oh wait, you have to flex on muh dps meters.
---
🤭
---
My buddy had this issue. Should be fine after like 24hours. If not I'd contact a GM
---
no no, think about the dps meter!!
---
So obvious that I even forgot that one!
---
Can Seal of Righteousness proc HoJ?
---
90 man raids of horde sitting on the boats in Menethil aren't "world pvp" as much as it's just a deathball that wipes out the entire alliance population.
---
People like classic because of nostalgia, it should be good enough for TBC aswel
---
But don't you get ported to the queuer's location after you end a BG with them?
---
I use ring menu on my mage for portals and stuff! Works pretty nicely
---
&gt; If blizzard were to follow this model they would have to devote much more resources to classic+ in order to make it feel like the quality is still on par with world of warcraft.
---
The model would be more like "new content without compromising the quality", because TBC introduced changes which undermined the very reason why people are now playing the classic.
---
So obvious that I forgot it!
---
Cause making it 6 person isnt helping them. It may be fun for you to get a kill. But they want honor. I see people praise classic for allowing different playstyles and freedom. This is there playstyle.
---
Everything Classic has to offer content wise, he isn't asking to be able to play every role...
---
Woulda coulda shoulda
---
I totally feel ya bro. What I really don’t get it how they camp our boats and none of these big guilds do shit about it. 
---
I rarely see alliance doing what the horde do. Or maybe I’m not just seeing it and alliance are out there corpse/fp camping. In the past 2wks? I’ve only ever seen alliance take over gadzetan once. Every other time it’s the horde who have taken over. 
---
Is it different on other servers? I’m in sulfuras.
---
I’ve switched to using AdiBags and really love it. There is an extra plugin for AbiBags that creates groups for your Item Rack sets too. 
---
It took me just a couple days to get used to using AdiBags and I’m never going back to anything else. It’s sooo good and convenient. 
---
It automatically groups your items together for you so your bags will always be organized every time open them.
---
Or the person who wants Jed. If only one person wants Jed why should others use their lockouts. Maybe don't be lazy entitled mage/paladin.
---
I wish they had kept the original graphics with an increased draw distance that didn't blow ass
---
It's free publicity I guess
---
what's up with all the wack ass self entitled players that demand help like they deserve it and use *the spirit of the game* or whatever the fuck to justify this delusional thought process
---
I cant tell if youre joking or not, but in case you didn't hear: I think a LFG mod was actually made and blizz nixed it for not being vanilla flavored haha.
---
It's easier if multiple people fish.
---
Not true for rogues. There are a lot of arguments over pre-bis gear.
---
Sulfuras. 54% horde but theyre bad so ally dominate
---
My guess is they have a deal worked out. Especially if he is literally plugging the channel on his stream.
---
Getting ganked then the person immediately flys away on their flying mount was definitely a better experience.
---
I'm not a tank and I completely disagree with you
---
netherwind has good balance, but it's not the megaserver most players are looking for
---
Thanks for the tip! Just the first thing that popped into my mind.
---
What’s the pop like? High?
---
Why would you be pvping in a group?
---
He talked a little bit about that and he said that he wasn’t upset by it at all. It was something along the lines of if someone else is able to make some cash by making videos of his content, he is happy for them. 
---
He is against Copyright Strikes and doesn’t do it, even if the videos are flat out bashing him.
---
If mobs are like 20 levels higher than you stealth doesn’t matter , and if you’re referring to vanish there’s a bug where vanish sometimes doesn’t work
---
5 months late to the party but fucking LOL
---
Hold faith brother. I got my rogue friend his hoj In literally 3 runs, and I got my savage glad chain as a hunter in under 20 arenas. Did the savage chain runs with another rogue who was looking for hoj, after I got my item I ran with him for another 3 hours till he got his item, then we both ran for another 2 or 3 hours to get the healer the pants from golem. Ended up joining his guild and we went from farming MC trash for rep to full clears in 2 hours. If you find a solid 3 individuals who need items from arena/anger/golem and have a big time block to grind out runs. Also it’s one of those things that having a guild can really help with. As someone who is as geared as can be for this phase outside of MC drops, I really enjoy running stuff with my friends who are just hitting 60 looking for those Gucci items
---
No idea. Everything about the old site is much better. The new one is just garbage all around.
---
well, i purchased a vehicle because i have a skill to pilot it and there is a need for people to get themselves and their items transported, which i am able to provide with the vehicle. since I already have what I want, exercising my sovereignty to achieve that, there isn't something more i can get from the people who benefit from transport.
---
what are you trying to get?
---
*now is all there is. we are all here*
---
ask people who played throughout vanilla and then tbc. 90% of these people will tell you tbc was a huge drop off in terms of fun and from a game design perspective. Of course in a reddit thread about TBC content a bunch of people who only experienced the tail end of vanilla will be piping up to defend the game they spent the most time playing. anyone with an equal comparison between the two prefers vanilla. in fact when they do release tbc and we’ve all played it, I bet in 5 years people will actually have the points of reference necessary to agree with me and realize how much better classic was in retrospect. But i don’t expect the TBC fans who grew up with wow starting in that expansion to realize that because they don’t have the experiences to allow them to create an informed and unbiased opinion.
---
Blood Knight is a blood elf paladin. Only Blood Elfs can be blood knights. Any race can be death knights.
---
Who demanded help? You’re obviously part of the problem. You sound like the only ‘wack ass self entitled player’ here.
---
If you measure pussyness after how "interactive" the ability is, polymorph along with rogue chain stun is the most pussy.   
---
It's basically just you having to wait for 10+ seconds while watching the opponent do stuff. Some of the duels in the tipsout tournament is just the rogue opening, then chain-stunning their opponnent until they are dead. Even a shaman with a shield. Its pretty disgusting to watch.
---
Ohhh please tell me immortality is a dwarf priest...
---
You can clear the content fast, but design wise I think its different. Like most vanilla dungeons are more "organically" designed to be a part of the game, as oppose to just a dungeon. Like, just compare ramparts to SFK, BRD, BFD or any vanilla dungeon really. The closest thing is probably the SM dungeons, but those are split into 4.
---
Most TBC 5 mans are just corridors where you just take a certain direction, go straight ahead, all the bosses are conveniently laid out in your path and at the end you get a nice shortcut. And eventually you do speed-run all of these dungeons because badges are a thing that you need to grind.
---
MC can be done fast, and it was in vanilla as well. But its not designed for quick clears, because the bosses are spread all over the place, and the most efficient to speed run it is to split up the raid to take different parts of the raid simultaneously.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again. 50/50 servers just mean both sides zerg the shit out of each other taking unbalanced fights where they can find them in the world. If you are caught out in the open world without a group, you'll probably be mowed down. The only difference is the amount of time you have to wait for help to show up. You can still be camped for 30+ minutes, but there is a higher chance a deathball of your faction will show up.
---
You seem to enjoy older games with simpler systems in place -- good for you. Behind the few successful games that you praise are thousands of failed companies that did not understand that businesses need to be managed in order to stay afloat.
---
High pop but not enough for ques
---
Yeah think about how many chat messages you see in just an hour asking for ports/water. Mages have it ez.
---
What do you mean a ton of gear from this phase? I need a breastplate of bloodthirst and.... what? 
---
This guy follows pre raid BIS lists and doesn’t understand why the pieces are individually good
---
Any good guilds to join???
---
TBC isn't bad, but its nowhere near as nostalgic.
---
You chose your server. Blizzard warned us
---
I like pvp, but wpvp is like being forced to do something different than you originally wanted to do. No one's doing dungeons right now (which give me gear and are fun) because Brm is constantly camped. If I've been pvping for a few hours, and just want to run something for some gold, or shit even a change of pace, it's gonna take me an hour minimum to get the whole party into the instance.
---
And I *like* pvp. Imagine if I didn't.
---
You must be on a low pop server. That's the only thing I can think of
---
What do u mean? If u enter while stealthed, you should come out the other side still stealthed
---
That's why I'm spriest. Mainly for pvp but to buff out locks and off heal if I need to. And building a healing set once healers have gear so I can help guildies and/or alts. While Mana management for spriests are low, I love that shit. Plus our kills are less than 80 seconds
---
He’s pretty savvy from what I’ve seen, even if childish. He must be making money off the channel.
---
I play horde so not really sure about ally guilds. Horde is pretty much all beaindead though so no good guilds yet.
---
Ouch your first paragraph just ruined any credibility I might have given you by default while reading the bulk of your post.
---
Each downvote is a tick of starshards hitting you.
---
This was on Herod
---
No. Get good
---
Grobbulus is pretty even and active with PVP
---
Tanking and healing are things Classic has to offer.
---
Fucking thank you. New seasons are the worst. Not even worth having on as background sound.
---
https://youtu.be/p-mhG48FvbA
---
You can skip Hydro and do the 2nd a different way as well. Look up shadowpriest solos and you'll find it
---
Yeah, but some people ended up on pvp servers cuz of friends and guild mates, but then they stop playing and now you stuck being corpse camped by 60s with nothing better to do than troll you
---
Dude was trolling you
---
Are you horde or ally
---
A mage in Kargrath whispered me offering to sell me a port. I was there too. I am a mage lol.
---
I'm not saying he needs to spend more money or live differently.  Why not reward someone who can video edit from his streaming community.
---
They do. QTPie from LoL kind of pioneered this with Fed. Lazy mega content guy cant be asked doing the channel but realizes that its money left on the table. Find/hire/allow some motivated editor to do the work for him and take a % of the channel that he was previously just leaving on the table due to laziness. Its actually a great setup and more people should do it. You do have to be a very large creator to make this kind of thing worth it though.
---
Go farm low levels relentlessly that's what the rest of the horde on fairbanks seem to do
---
Camping people who don't give you honor is definitely toxic
---
I recommend Mage. Frost can take you all the way. Free food and water, aoe grinding masters, top tier dps with a one button rotation.
---
You can LoS the sacrifice and SWP cast or simply grounding totem. He'll also sacrifice your searing fire totem without wasting your grounding
---
Warlocks are in high demand for raiding as well. This might just be my server but you will always be wanted for your banish ability
---
Its not false.
---
Classic hasn't aged well. People finally seeing that
---
Retail has been garbage for quite some time... Years actually. Classic gave blizzard the boost it needed.
---
I got an alliance warrior with t1 and hand of rag down to 60% as a 53 rogue last night lol
---
Once Naxx is on farm, TBC will be around the corner. Many will be eagerly looking forward to it.
---
TBC is a fail-boat on private servers because the private servers never were able to properly replicate it without tons of bugs or scripting issues. Stop using pserver as gospel.
---
What level are you? The devilsaur set is bis until you get both legs and gloves from MC.
---
I doubt arena has a large enough audience to justify serious investment. Its always been niche and its basically the same every season.
---
This was how classic was at some point. Sure there are more players now. But it shows that good chunks of classic wow have aged like milk
---
Get rank 14 then, or wait for wrath?
---
PvP was and should have remained a side element to the game, and maybe the class design would have been better from cata and beyond.
---
I am Alliance
---
Way to shift your argument from MC to “all of classic wow is easy.” You’re completely full of shit.
---
Dude is worth over $2mil and it looks like he is making 500k+/yr. It seems like he lives a simple life so maybe he just honestly doesn’t care. He’s getting his so he might just be cool with it at this point.
---
[That's the most evil thing I can imagine...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/012/367/evilest.jpg)
---
That name looks familiar! Definitely Seen you die on your way to dire maul today.
---
Yeah, I ask if it's ok to reserve the first orb of Strat live runs, otherwise I don't run with randoms and even then... Man, the stuff you encounter's amazing. Mages who refuse to CC, interrupt, or do *anything* but AoE, Hunters who break their own freezing trap regularly, DPS massively lower than mine, healers who spam Flash Heal over and over  and shield me as a  warrior...
---
I haven't run a lot of random dungeons, but most have been...Servicable at most, and awful slogs with unpleasant people at their worst. I'd rather just tank dungeons for my guildies for free and have fun than run dungeons with randoms and most likely get nothing but high repair costs and frustration.
---
If someone doesn't want me reserving the orb, fair enough. There's more tanks out there, I bet some'll do it for free and will do a great job, too, but I'd rather...Not at this point, as I don't need any dungeon gear except for SGC at this point.
---
they were 40 levels lower then me. im aware of the vanish bug i was not talking about that
---
I don’t buy it, but whatever. If that’s the case he’s fucked when the revenue stream stops flowing. You can’t retire on 2 mil at 30.
---
you're crying that these players don't want to share honor with you, you're the selfish one not being able to hold your own and wanting to leech honor off others
---
learn when to wait for organized groups to show up so you can rez at a safe location/time
---
you evidently don't care about honor, that's great, why get in the way of others that do? you're making this a "nobody want to help each other out" thing when you're literally demanding to leech off better players
---
there's no right or wrong way to play the game. some people want to be efficient with their time spent. just because you share the same faction and just happen to be in the same zone, doesn't mean anybody is obligated to help you/let you leech honor
---
I found a really good spot for 53-56,  DM for details because I don't want gankers finding out.
---
Tbc nostalgia is purely the raids and themes. The actual mechanics and player interaction arent what people celebrate like wow classic is
---
Capitalism is good.
---
Posts like this are why I camp grays.
---
I have.
---
A literal shit post
---
Sent you a DM
---
You're talking as if it was easy to get full gear with badges, it's not, it takes a long time even if you're doing all the heroic every day.
---
Everyone has different opinions about flying mount, I like them because it only brings positive things to the game.
---
Definitely recommend bloodfang, on flamelash I couldnt quest in Felwood or Winterspring without being ganked every 5 mins; roaming death squads and all that.
---
Bloodfang seems generally calmer, had a solid 2 hour farm in Felwood at primetime and only ganked once!
---
It seems unfair to hold him to such high standards. Expecting him to do more work and donate it all to charity. It’d be an admirable thing to do for sure... but just because he doesn’t do that doesn’t mean he’s lazy.
---
Because people like to play MMOs long-term. 
---
If we are going BC&gt;Wrath, then there isn't a sustainable long term approach.
---
Thanks I’ll try it out!
---
3 would be enough, 3 lock alts in different accounts with 2 other just clickers.
---
The resemblance is uncanny.
---
Simply not true.  You won't have roaming raids of people doing this once they reach those ranks/milestones.
---
I'm dreading getting the boots on my Shaman. They only drop from Omok in LBRS and *no-one* wants to do him.
---
Hey Frozt! (assuming you're the Undead Mage on Fairbanks) Thanks for the kind words and the support. It's always a lot of fun getting to see you around the world and in the fairbanks discord
---
Hello there!
---
All he has to do is channel his energy into something else, thanks he’s cured. You solved depression
---
You do realize 6p t0 is pre raid bis, right? It's about 50-60 dps over the non set pre raid bis.
---
I only use details and questie add on. So default ui but haven’t encountered this yet.
---
Definitely isn’t hardware if multiple parties experiencing it.
---
I would guess a UI affecting add on
---
I had a Tauren with an offensive name, I think it ChokeAHoe or something to that effective (edgy 13 year old), after it got reported and had to be changed I changed it to “Igotreported”. Apparently that’s also unacceptable.
---
Fucking sick dude
---
I am a lock and I agree locks can do as much damage, but its inconsistent because the lack of hit. I disagree that mageblade should be lock prio. Most guilds i think give mageblade to mages and staff of dom to locks.
---
Well I think pve servers is the alternative if you dont like it.
---
I think people thought pvp was gonna be some glorious brothers in arms type shit. Its just zerging and murder.
---
You're perceived as whiny when you have a problem with it. You're presumably a dps, which means you bring zero value to the group. Which means most tanks aren't gonna care about you if you have a problem with them reserving 1 orb. 
---
You got about as good of a chance of Tom Brady playing on your backyard football team.
---
Just unsub. The only language this company understands is $. They've completely fucked up the vanilla experience but you're still paying to have a bad time.
---
Was about to say. If he wasn’t getting a cut he’d have copy right striked it.
---
Yes but you are a mage, the class who have the easiest time making money.
---
Ah yeah ofc
---
Whenever I see a mage trying to sell portals or water, I /yell free portals and water. For the most part I've made money with tips, but mainly I do it because I'm against the idea of whoring yourself for money.
---
Well 4 one for each location
---
My guild is there and I don't want to reroll and have to level up again and gear up again. Fucking sucks and I hate it. I effectively only raid log now...
---
That's not what he specified in the post
---
Here on Heartseeker, I (dwarf warrior) always ask for 1 stack of food and 5 stacks of water before heading out to dungeon etc.
---
Tips 1g every time. No matter what.
---
The only one post Wrath that I'd play is Legion. I had so much fun in Legion.
---
Well, not to convey my indifference, but they are farming honor for themselves, not for you. They are helping you by stopping the people camping you. They don't want to wait for you to run back. They don't want to wait for you to keep up on your 60% mount. They don't want to risk you getting a dk for their group. They aren't a charity. Plus, you don't need to be in their group to get honor. If you can keep up with them, you can leech honor from their group. But maybe you should make your own group to farm honor instead.
---
It was on every point a better game than vanilla for me.
---
My take:
---
Yes flying ruined the world feeling like the world. You didn’t experience the world anymore you just flew over it. If someone didn’t feel like fighting you just just mounted up and flew away maybe tossing a /spit or /lol as they soared away leaving you down below. 
---
Frankly I don’t care as much about the ease of the content as much as the scale of the content and the social elements that vanilla forced upon you. If you don’t like it maybe don’t play an mmo. The content isn’t hard but it forces you to play nice with others and be a part of a giant 40 man team week after week to get loot. and the point of loot is that it makes you stronger in the world. it’s that simple. it doesn’t only maker you better at pve or pvp. it’s hard to get because it’s limited in supply and it just makes you stronger. simple as that. 
---
Dailies weren’t optional if you wanted to farm gold optimally. They were forced repeated content and they sucked the fun out of the game for me. I refused to do dailies after week one because it was frankly insulting that they thought that was a good design choice.
---
Write your own narrative be the Guardian you want to be. Form a grp protect the flight point with friends and like-minded people. Have fun while you do IT . :)
---
Even better, give us "WAKANDA FOREVER!" realms!
---
This picture in fake, no skeletons
---
I don't know man but it's been like that on almost every bigger private server despite BGs being out from start.
---
This won't change much throughout vanilla
---
He would only need 3 accounts
---
You dont know how to play a getal druid then. Always top 5 on trash and always in top 7 of bosses. Sometimes top 3 golemagg and magmadar..... Stop saying that feral is shit dps IT isnt
---
Yup,  i was thinking "oh, so somebody is just doing what QTpie and dom have been doing for forwver"
---
2, because they eventually sell, or not
---
I mean most of the huge content contributors I know sub-contract their YouTube channels; it’s just like paying someone to do your social media if you own a business. I think it’s quite smart.
---
Get the add-on auctioneer.
---
&gt; Tauren Paladin...where are those? Can I make one now? /s🙄
---
Sorry, I guess my addon made the Shaman name pink? I can't play horde so I don't know the details of the races.
---
I was questing in Thistleshrub Valley which is just about the only place in Tanaris that is generally hilly. You can see my quest in my quest tracker and can confirm that is where it would take me.
---
Well, you can keep pretending that you know what every alliance or horde player is going to do. I gave you the options that worked on private servers. You'll never get a real balance, the best you can do is tip it in the undersized faction's favour. Letting both factions transfer off a server is dumb. 
---
This is the same company that released 5 servers from the get-go. They don't give a fuck about classic's longevity. As long as we all get bored in time for Shadowlands.
---
Like wrong how? (genuine question, never played a dedicated main healer or used healer guides)
---
Do we have to be serious all the time? Can an ad for a Looney Toons game on the classicwow sub not be funny?
---
It really wasn't ever like this, as others have stated before better than me.
---
People had more time to hit 60, few understood the honor system back then, few were decked out in t1/t2 this early into the game existing, Alliance was the more popular faction on PvP servers, and triple/quadruple the amount of people on one server make things drastically differernt.
---
Just switched from Enh to Resto/Ele at 60 because it was too hard finding raids/dungeons as Enh. Any tips for adding value to raids as Enh sham?
---
In what world does Mp5 outweigh healing. It's pretty much deadweight as a stat right now.
---
Going into DM North and making it to the final boss without killing any other bosses.
---
When you do this a chest spawn with many items in it (3 blues at least).  Once you finish and talk to an Ogre everything turns green and you can also go open any chests, looks for tomes, etc...
---
People that can solo them sell the items in chest if they are valuable like the Rod of the Ogre Magi for 30-50 gold usually.
---
Not if you’re trying to live like a baller no. 
---
Buy a 200-300k house (or less) 30-50k car. Plop over half a mil into your checking and live off that and interest accrued from your other million annually. 
---
Not to mention, I’m willing to bet that he’s got at minimum another 2-3 years left on the streaming avenue. His stream is constantly packed every single day he’s on and all he’s been doing is playing Classic.
---
New WoW Xpac(s) plus new Classic content patches will keep a steady flow going for awhile.
---
I bet youre the life of the party
---
Completely agree. For all the ones that got close to 60 but no quite there yet, this is a nightmare. I had hopes of getting to 60 before December but yesterday I got killed by alliance deathsquads literally every minute I was alive in Un'Goro. After running back to my corpse 5 times and pretty much dying in 30 seconds everytime, I just had to log off and do something else. It's not fun to be so close to 60 and be literally unable to play a game you pay a subscription for.
---
Well I played to TBC for around 10 years on a lot of different private servers, I know what TBC looks like and everyone I know in our "community" of PvP players share basically the same opinion that vanilla PvP is garbage
---
Yes, as a priest I did this to get the wand.
---
What you do is mind vision hop from one mob to another closer to his spawn locations. You can also use /tar Skul while you are mind visioning an enemy closer to his spawns to quickly see if he is there.
---
Farm the 3-4 schmucks that pick alliance in a group of 40
---
season 2 was the golden age of wow pvp
---
Haha no, i’m happy if I can load an imgur picture on a SAS flight
---
I was questing in Thistleshrub Valley which is hilly.
---
I mean i can create a list of flaws with classic too and many would agree the issues with classic are more damaging to the experience overall. if you want to try an actual list of comparative issues let’s discuss. if you want to just have a one-sided “private server bad and illegal reeee” take then i’m not interested.
---
allies = buttfrustrated CONFIRMED
---
(/s, in case)
---
Really depends what he means by do everything classic has to offer TBH. Does he mean he wants to be able to Tank, DPS, and Heal? If so druid is hands down the best choice.
---
Is this some sort of personal attack?
---
How many times do you have to die to get into BRD?
---
How is getting r14 challenging? You legit just need to play 15h a day, you don't even have to be good at the game, that's typical vanilla philosophy "play more, not better" and I truly hate that
---
I really dont understand the hate for flying mounts. Flying is a nice convenience, the problem isnt flying itself but how it's so easily accessible and lets you bypass some parts of the game. If they could somehow find a way to balance that out, it'd be allright.
---
Also, after past two weeks  getting camped by 10+ alliance all the time while I'm trying to do dungeons, I dont really care about its effects on WPVP. Fk that.
---
One time I was doing UBRS and the other warrior asked me something. I responded but it said he had me on ignore list. I tried telling the group to tell him that many times and nothing happened. Can someone even whisper you when they have you on ignore list?
---
He’s rewarding someone, it’s just not under his direct control. Someone gets a job out of it; he’s spreading wealth around like a responsible business owner.
---
Is there xp earned in bg's?
---
Not my style
---
That’s what she said!
---
We don't know what he is asking because he was very unclear about it. He may have meant everything classic has to offer content wise like you think, but he may just as easily haven't meant it role wise...
---
Tons of issues for Classic on pservers, but people stuck with it AND people liked Classic enough to actively develop for it and fix issues. That has NOT been the case with TBC pservers,
---
I still think you miss the whole point of Classic. Classic is a game style that drastically differs from Retail. TBC started going down the path of retail with daily quests, welfare epics, badge gear, and other things.
---
I'm talking about pugs where nothing is reserved and there is screeching from bis disciples when someone roles for a huge upgrade against a minor boost.
---
If it helps at all, I’m the exact opposite on Yojamba. Horde everywhere. Not even enough time to apply a small dose of lube
---
No
---
He says he doesn’t mind because a lot of the people who become followers/subscribers to his stream start out seeing him on a YouTube video first, and then come to twitch to see him.
---
So by interfering with the money generated by YouTube creators, he would actually be hurting his own platform.
---
This past time was the only time I’ve seen him say he’d consider asking for a percentage. I don’t think he realized how much the content leeches are making. 
---
But ..hey...whatever he’s doing is working. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it
---
Health insurance is expensive. He would miss out on social security and a lot of other stuff.
---
make friends with the druids of your server
---
He didn't specify anything in his post...
---
Aw hell no
---
That’s good information to know. Thank you!
---
Awesome, now every day I’ll be tea-bagging horde!
---
yea, its not 'real' pvp, its just ganking. no skill. join a grp and go 5+ vx 1, just zerging each other
---
Best was a player from the old days with ads about shoving you through his hole
---
Why the fuck is this controversial? Gratz on the rag kill
---
tongue
---
you seem like a very angry person.
---
Ok, lets go with your logic. There are currently 10 PvE servers for US/Oceania realms. There are 30 PvP servers. Even if all the PvE realms are alliance dominated. That still leaves horde dominating if we clearly both agree that PvP servers are horde with just a few alliance.
---
Rogue, but you're going to get out dpsed by whichever mage wins the ignite lottery and gets credit for every other mages ignite.
---
Imagine watching streaming.. fucking Zoomers..
---
I always log my main (Warlock) on in IF and ask for 6 stacks of water and 2 stacks of food and then tip them 2 gold.  It’s the polite thing to do.
---
I usually try to hit up guildies first and still tip them but if none are around I just ask politely the mages close to me.
---
My server is ally favored, and they camp the fuck out of us. Stop pretending like the sides are different
---
Sounds like you didn't play vanilla.
---
Health insurance roughly $4k/year and as for Social Security...that will most likely by long gone before he’s 60-65. That’s a different discussion entirely though lol
---
Ah, and this is Hunter only?
---
Believe it or not, I thought Legion was the only expansion good enough to stand alongside TBC and Vanilla and it's also the only other one that I'm excited for a re-release of.
---
Nobody calls blood spec Dk's blood knights.  Blood knights in warcraft lore are blood elf paladins stealing their power from a captured naru
---
How do you get to Stonard?
---
Photos taken seconds before disaster...
---
We can put it like that:
---
WoW subscribers peaked at TBC, therefore a lot of players started playing to TBC, so it was their first Wow experience.
---
There might be more players out there with vanilla as first WoW expensive than TBC, but don't say that TBC is nowhere near as nostalgic as vanilla.
---
Horde out here shittin errybody
---
They don’t have much else to look at lol
---
Tell us your class and faction
---
No because it's an ad nobody cares..
---
100% he was summoned, he would have leveled at least once from exploration xp.
---
What is the same as vanilla is that there are lots of people who rolled on a pvp server who aren't cut out for it.
---
Fair enough. I feel like a lot of people playing classic have only played wow for an mmo experience (which is reasonable, it's been the industry standard for 15 years). As someone who's played games where world/large scale pvp IS the endgame, I kind of saw the zerg coming from the beginning. A lot of ally get frustrated getting camped for 15 minutes or so, when I've been camped for *hours* in different games. It's just not part of what people expected from p2 (foolishly)
---
It's a screenshot from retail showing his vanilla rogue. How are you guys not getting this?
---
Everyone here suggesting hunter without actually knowing the true power of warlock DME with mining farm. Over a longer period of time it'll net you 100-175g/h without trouble. Hunter tribute runs will only ever give more gold if you manage to sell items from your runs which will never happen because of the amount of players doing the same thing.
---
Having an absolute blast in the 40 bracket as alliance on a fairly balanced server. Zero issues, plenty of good fights.
---
Death knights aren't bloodknights. The blood elves lost faith in the light and had to find a new source and sapped a Naaru's energy in place of Holy Light.
---
(We even had Seal of Blood and other flavour named abilities.)
---
You rolled pvp server knowing the implications of such. Pve was and still is available - reroll.
---
I honestly don’t think people have accurate memories of class design in TBC. Yes they made ferals and ret paladins viable (actually they clearly overdid it). But throughout the patches there were constant changes and most classes went from being underpowered to overpowered and back ten times. It was frankly a shit show from a class design perspective. Vanilla isn’t and wasn’t perfect either but what we have now in classic is actually pretty reasonable and certainly better than TBC most of the time too.
---
GET BIGGEST METAL TO HIT ENEMY IN FACE! MAKE WARCHIEF HAPPY!
---
I tanked a lbrs run lastnight as an enhancement shaman. Had 2 wars that "couldn't" tank so I said fuck it and did it myself. Went a little slow but. No major issues. People put too much into BiS and min/max. Enjoy the game or go back to retail
---
fucking swoon
---
Again how is the mage/paladin lazy? They join a group that says LF1M Jed/Rend runs. They expect the group to have Jed since they advertised that they had him they get there and turns out group doesn't have him despite saying they did. So he either makes you wait while you reset to find him or leaves. Either you as the party leader go yourself and find him before advertising that you have a Jed ID, or you don't advertise that you have a Jed ID when you don't have one, or expect to wait for someone to find him or for the caster to leave. Don't lie and try and trick people into running a dungeon with you then whining when they bail on you after finding out you lied.
---
since you wanted to shit talk about my guild, why dont you tell me your toon name and guild first? and i will tell you mine.
---
I'm sorry you cannot say that roaming death squads in every single city in the game were a part of vanilla. Vanilla barely had enough people to get most servers going let alone be able to have like 20 people at every contested city/zone. I have 2 60s right now in classic and love Wpvp but this shit isnt Wpvp if people just roam as 20 and unless you roam as a 20 man as well you basically just die for the next hour or so
---
It's not much but its honest work
---
Obviously, I was kidding. It hasn’t even been close to the same time line as before when you consider we’re on a single patch. Naxx will probably be our for 4-6 months before they release BC if they even do
---
&gt;The model would be more like "new content without compromising the quality"
---
Which is why I worry when people throw around the osrs model because I think osrs totally compromised quality. What you said sounds great, but it requires a lot of trust in blizzard to put significant resources into classic+. It would require a large dev team of experienced people to create something that wouldn't compromise the quality.
---
 I would prefer tbc, but I wouldn't quit if classic+ was the next step, only if it seemed blizzard would take it seriously. If they used the osrs model of giving it a small dev team to basically follow the will of the community, I would become very worried.
---
I think the thing that everyone is glossing over is not just frustrating existing players who made a bad choice; they're forgetting the fact that it's going to drive off NEW players from rolling on the server, causing the pool of players to stagnate and die off over time.
---
It's the same reason PVP-focused MMOs like Aion never did well, people are inherently selfish assholes and think about their short term gains rather than long term big picture like server population or even game longevity if they drive everyone else off in their quest for personal domination. EVE being a rare exception to the rule.
---
Had forors drop in DM West 2md boss followed by Destiny from trash 15 minutes later.
---
Then the other day again in DM west forors dropped again. 
---
Few days later Skull flame shield dropped in Strat UD. 
---
Shame I am a hunter, sorted out our guild tanks though
---
Defcamp? Dude's pretty scrubby from what I've seen.
---
Just because you disagree with an opinion doesn't mean it's naive, I played to TBC for a long time, probably a lot more than you and I totally disagree that it kills the "massive multiplayer" experience. Just because you can go from point A to point B without getting killed 1v3 doesn't mean it ruins massive multiplayer experience.
---
why are you mad at someone for making money and keeping it instead of giving it away? If he made it then it’s his to do with as he pleases. Doesn’t make him a bad person because he doesn’t want to give all his money away lol
---
I mean, give me a level 60 toon with the same gear and I'll fight with the best of them. Very odd comment. Classic WoW is a very easy game to play, very little skill needed for it compared to retail or other MMO's that are out there. So I'm confused as to what you mean by "aren't cut out for it." You must mean to say that anyone who doesn't have the time to play more than casually should stay away from pvp servers? Just trying to understand.
---
I’m not talking about pre-raid BiS. I’m talking about actual BiS. Everyone has pre raid BiS by now. Half of my guild has full on phase 2 week 2 content BiS at this point.
---
Not to mention as a druid you need way more than one or two sets of gear.
---
Pala is real easy and real good for solo play lock is way more demanding.
---
It's a spec for sniping a single target. That ability definitely isn't exclusively useful for dueling.
---
I'd even go as far as to say that it's _not_ a dueling spec if you're heavily reliant on a 3min cd to win your fights. You can't claim to be a good duelist if you can't win consecutive duels
---
A lot of sources are just outright bad imho. Cant speak for Warriors, but many priest lists have big errors.
---
Happens when I distract someone, freaks me out every time so I spam that cheap shot extra hard
---
6pc shadowcraft is superior but hard to replace when u get raid drops
---
Throw a shadow priest in the group and you got a dps stew going baby!
---
I wanna try TBC at max level, but I'd also really like classic+ of some sort.
---
They just seem to be the best class to accomplish it solo.  Warlocks can solo it also I believe.
---
Tribute runs can be done as a full group as well.
---
Tell me honestly that you played throughout vanilla and also thoughout TBC and have an equal point of comparison for both and I will consider your opinion of value.
---
Thanks for confirming what I experienced.
---
I submitted a bug report and hopefully they can confirm whether it's consistent with the reference-client or not.
---
So by that logic...anyone who is not already 60 should stay away from PVP servers? What happens when the game starts to die down? Those PVP servers will die and stay dead if anyone who doesn't have a 60 already stays away from them.
---
If you're still working on it, I'd advice using the "custom text" option instead of default text settings in ElvUI's UnitFrames.
---
someone is making over 300k a year cutting and editing videos of Asmongold? damn...

---
Defcamp is cool but yeah I think Melderon is more the theorycrafting guy
---
Agreed, 100 percent
---
This seems low effort. The post comments on the post comparing Horde to toilets also known as shitters. Therefore Hordes are shitters because we shit on alliance all day.
---
i love the tbc aesthetic, it's classic warcraft and all the zones are both diverse and fantastic
---
Well a toilet DEALS with the shit. It flushes it away
---
Undercity being a sewer is also a big coincidence hmmm
---
The pvp system encourages behavior the community as a whole seems to hate
---
What the frick is rule number one again?!?!?!?!!!!
---
The Horde can’t meme.
---
These violent delights have violent ends.
---
Someone literally cried out “moon sub here!” when I got to the booty bay dock. They immediately killed me. Curse the reputation the Guano Gang carries.
---
Kinda crazy how people make more than a good living off doing stuff like that, daily dose of asmongold is a small channel compared to some of e.g fortnite channels only consisting of plays sent in already edited or straight from a streamer vod.
---
&gt; You're perceived as whiny when you have a problem with it
---
lol - no less whiny than tanks who get upset when people refuse to capitulate to their excessive demands
---
&gt;You're presumably a dps, which means you bring zero value to the group
---
??? Ah yes, DPS bring absolutely nothing to the table. Thats why dungeons and raids only bring tanks and healers. Thanks for the laugh - this quote speaks volumes.
---
&gt;  Which means most tanks aren't gonna care about you if you have a problem with them reserving 1 orb
---
My experience is that many tanks are perfectly fine sharing with everyone else who contributes to the dungeons completion - you know, the whole group?
---
&gt; You got about as good of a chance of Tom Brady playing on your backyard football team
---
Not sure what this means. I run live strat daily, multiple times, and never have a problem finding tanks who are cool with a round robin system.
---
On Pagle there has basically been a constant battle at the gates of Orgrimmar for the last week.. Horde is at around a 20 to 80% disadvantage population wise on that server, but as a Horde player it has been amazingly fun. Sometimes the Alliance overrun us because of numbers and camp the city for a bit, but most of the time its back and forth. Having the guards and DHKs makes it a little more fair for the Horde. Then when you don't want to fight you let your pvp flag drop and go about your day.. So glad I rolled on a pve server.
---
You may think this is funny, until you realize the Alliance insignia is a 'big pussy'
---
Wow I envy the free time
---
considering the low upvotes and overwhelmingly negative comments it seems pretty unpopular to me.
---
reddit mad
---
Hey, these drop a pattern, lets kill them. Drops. I dont win roll :(
---
That game is terrible btw - the devs are the most absolutely blatant cash grabbers I've ever seen and I've seen some pretty bad ones.
---
My logic is using the statistics we have and had available. If we use the website wowclassicpopulation which uses an addon to scan and then players upload their data, the category of level 51-60 has a [split](https://i.imgur.com/8Uhj87H.png) of 53% Horde to 47% Alliance. Adjusting that to 60 only shows 54% Horde to 46% Alliance. 
---
If we look at the data from [wowhead](https://i.imgur.com/SJS7g6l.png) from September (which is very old) and also adjust for the fact that there is no search by level range, we can still see that Horde does in fact outnumber Alliance on PVP servers as we expected but the overall number of characters is a 50:50 split. 
---
The wowhead data is unfortunately not usable to due to the fact that it's incredibly old and only counts unique characters, not higher level characters.
---
And no, I don't agree that PVP servers are horde with just a few alliance. You'd be a fool to think that.
---
Yeah sure, enjoy it while it lasts... As a lvl 54 player bg's cant come soon enough tho
---
Sure, because you are always 5+ people vs 1 alli because horde can't do shit alone
---
of course
---
It is the best! Almost every dungeon starts annoy me after I did it more than twice but sfk I did already like 10 times on all my toons and its still a blast!
---
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THAT DAMN DAGGER WONT DROP ON MY ROGUE!!
---
Confirmed horde invented toilets because alliance are a bunch of nasties
---
Yep. It shocked me. And usually it’s nothing extreme. It’s literally a small intro graphic, then it just runs right into the clip directly from the stream and fades to an outro graphic. Not a ton of backend work going on.
---
Go to North Ashenvale, always 4 - 5 hunters farming bears there.  Definitely botters. Definitely Chinese. Their pet’s names are all Chinese characters (or Mandarin or whatever... I’m not cultured...)
---
I remember lots of whine threads on the Blizzard forums early in vanilla from people who got killed on pvp servers.
---
Okay? The horde will ALWAYS have the throne!!
---
People where shit back then. We as players have objectively gotten better for the most part. The game hadn't chsnged at all. But the players have
---
I thought you get XP from handing in the marks from like WSG etc.
---
I would never, him being new probably would if I wasn’t watching. Lol he has no concept of what gear is good for him or anyone else. When I say he’s new he’s new
---
I'm not mad?  Im just saying hes lazy.
---
I mean you just said "faction specific transfers," so let's at least agree that we are both proposing to know what other people will do.
---
Cool story bro
---
Exactly, I'm a veteran player, 14 years going strong. I get that it will eventually die down. My co-workers experiencing classic for the first time? Already decided to give up after this week and they are only mid 30's. It's a shame. This is not the way Classic was intended to be experienced.
---
The reaction time of 
---
1. Spotting a stealthed rogue with the mk1 eyeball
---
2. Reading the name text
---
3. Typing out a target command with that name text
---
Is much higher than clicking on an icon.
---
Wait is that why no one wants to come over to my house anymore?
---
It's far more likely because those priests are undergeared. And if he's topping the meters, well that's because there's more likely than not, no resto shamans in the raid. For if there were, he is not topping those meters anytime soon on overall raid healing. On some boss fights maybe, but even then I question the priest's performance. He shouldn't be anywhere near on top.
---
O K  B O O M E R
---
Takes like on average 10 deaths to even ENTER brd, dm or strat
---
Ye this doesnt work as well, need to find a better comeback before warchief gets real angry
---
Just because its unique doesn't mean it doesn't suck
---
That was kinda normal in vanilla.
---
52 for arena, 54 for arena+anger,  56-57 for emp runs
---
There is no 50%/50% server. All census numbers are estimates. You may have servers in which Alliance counter attack and gank everything too, but there is no truly balanced server.
---
Yep, 30/0/21 is the bomb. Great solo/farming potential, huge DPS, and you can heal just fine. 
---
It does limit you more to spamming chain-heal since you’re no longer the best option as a tank-healer, but even as deep resto I found that I was most helpful to the guild when spamming chain heals. So it’s not much harm done.
---
If you have 60g by level 23, you are either doing one or multiple things *very* wrong.
---
I see alot of frustration in my guild and on forums  about the issue.  I personnaly don't want the timeline of phase to change because eventually we  will reach the end and I don't want that to happen.  The game haven't been on for 3 months and we are about to hit phase 2.5. At  this rate, the game will be fully release after less than a year.
---
I think when people says you aren't cut for pvp they might be right.  The MMO I played the most had actual penalties for dying (loss of experience, gear and skills) so corpse walking 5x per hour doesn't frustrate me at all since I don't  lose progress.  Imagine losing 1 to 3 pieces of gear everytime you die.  Imagine losing experience.  Lot of MMO lasted a long time with more harsh pvp system so I don't think it's gonna affect WoW.
---
I think you would have more fun on a PVE server.
---
&gt; And if you get your pre Bis/BiS that could be worth like 300-500g of itemization.
---
I have all my p2 BiS. I farm instances for money - as in, passing on greens and orbs and the like defeats the entire purpose.
---
&gt; I'm not wasting my time. 
---
Same - that is why I refuse to join a group with a greedy tank who thinks he deserves more than everyone else.
---
&gt; I am not waiting on a group lol as a fully geared tank
---
Right because you are in demand - the advantage of getting a group whenever you like is all the more reason why you shouldn't be making loot demands - you already have an advantage. 
---
&gt; You are assuming you win several drops if you assume a higher value. It is possible to spend an hour in a dungeon and not win any drops.
---
Right. That is the nature of the game. You know what *guarantees* I wont win anything? Tanks demanding orbs / trash BoP's be reserved.
---
&gt;I recall several times coming out of a dungeon empty handed or having lost gold due to wiping due to poor dps/heal play
---
I recall many times where poor tanking caused wipes too - it is almost like, no matter what role, some players are good and some are bad.
---
Those threads you are remembering? Probably an over-leveled rogue farming a few lowbie's in Ashenvale, or a hunter farming skins in STV killing questers taking tags from him. 4 to 5 40 man raids of 60's kitted out in raid gear 3 months into the game? Farming for honor, knowing exactly the most efficient way and exactly what they are farming for? Yeah those threads didn't exist in Vanilla.
---
Idk what to feel right now
---
I see that as playing smart. Never take even fights.
---

&gt; I'm against the idea of whoring yourself for money.

So you rather whore yourself out for free?

Missing a dead gnome on the bridge,  but other than that - awesome job! 10/10
---
Sure it does, his lil snoot fits perfectly in the bowl!  It's adorable
---
This.  In vanilla my guild was close.  We went through 3 or 4 games together.  I remember every Saturday morning farming scholo for a rogue friend.  Nothing to gain from it.  The activity itself was what I was tanking for.
---
It is fun to play with friends, not for gear or rewards.  Sadly I had a friend ask why he should do WC when there was no gear for him, after he complained that we barely play together....
---
40 bracket.... Trust me, you should be happy that bg's are gonna be out when you get to ur 50's
---
Is black lotus only one spawn per zone? E.g. if you loot a black lotus in Winterspring, then there will be no other black lotuses in the rest of the zone until waiting for the respawn timer? Or is it possible for there to be more than one per zone?
---
It's me.
---
Op's user name is butt bandit....checks out
---
&gt;whoring yourself for money.
---
Damn. You hate people work that much? I think it's cool. You spend idle time by helping people out who in turn give you something in return for your troubles.
---
Looks like I'm "shitting" in redridge tonight.
---
I have an FR det, a threat set, and a survivability set I truly don’t understand what additional pieces I’ll need for tanking?
---
There’s obviously some loot I could still use from raids but... how do dungeons affect that? Please, inform me how running Strat Live will get me a Ring if Accuria.
---
Because any decently geared group will DPS him down super fast and a mage or lock will sort the skellies right away.
---
The vast majority of dungeon mechanics are being ignored in favour of high DPS this go around.
---
To be fair, no one would know there would be a ~1 month period where questing is almost impossible for mid 40s onwards, and that all towns and boats are constantly invaded.
---
You can’t really take more than 1 or 2 resto Druid’s since hots don’t stack.
---
So having a moonkin for additional battle rezes or innervates is better for the raid overall than a 3rd resto Druid.
---
Assuming you can actually find 3 resto Druid’s in your server for a raid.

Ive been using grid since tbc and feel naked without it... pretty clean addon and doesnt take a lot of space
---
You can see by fumes, that it stinks 😁
---
Let me give you an anecdote you'll probably relate to that explains the difference on the servers. This morning I did a UBRS run with seven people, and we flew into Thorium Point. When we landed there were a couple of Horde camping the flight point who we promptly blew to pieces, and then about twenty seconds later a full raid of 12 or so appeared and just annihilated us and corpse camped us. So far, so familiar.
---
We got corpse camped until about halfway to BRM, which was about 4 corpse runs for me. Then we ran to the base of BRM and bumped into another group of Alliance, and we wiped a couple of horde groups trying to enter BRM as we waited for our Priest to escape TP. Shortly afterwards we ran over to UBRS and zoned in, for a total duration of 10-15 minutes. 
---
I actually kinda enjoyed the experience overall, unlike the Flamelash UBRS / BRD runs which are just hell with groups of horde strung out at 100 yard intervals right the way out to the UBRS entrance that result in 10+ deaths and a 30 minute wait. I think the Horde still have the edge in world PVP on Bloodfang but you're not being camped everywhere you go in every zone you go, and the Alliance do get their own back on unfortunate Hordies quite regularly.
---
Basically Bloodfang feels like a proper PVP server to me, and it's not much quieter than Flamelash in terms of Alliance. I definitely think moving is worthwhile, but that's just my two cents.
---
(Boat to Menethil is *always* camped though, which sucks for lowbies.)

I’m someone who’s never played wow before and basically got shoehorned into it by my friends because of The hype around classic and because they all have been trying to get me into wow since Cata. I just recently made a retail character after getting my rogue to 60 on classic and being bored outta my mind with nothing to do. I know a lot of elitist HATE what I’m about to say but fuck it, a lot of the conveniences in retail that make the game “easy” are a fucking godsend, and I wish classic had some of them (dungeon finder is the main one), and while leveling is faster and easier in classic the end content is way way harder unlike what people have been saying about the “good old days when raids challenged you”. Once the nostalgia glasses came off people realized that classic end content is REALLY EASY compared to retail. It’s just people got significantly better at the game, so classic seemed hard because back then nobody knew what the fuck they were doing.

---
Gate should open when all the adds pre baron are dead anyway. Had a lock get stuck other week and it opened up for him.
---
Christ you sound like someone who doesnt know which racials are good and just repeat shit youve seen before. For example, wotf got nerfed and isnt nearly as good as it is in classic, not to mention that fear in general got massively nerfed as well thus further reducing wotf's usefulness. Its strongest iteration is in vanilla/classic and in tbc its borderline useless, this is why rmp is the king of 3s.  
---
Arguably the best racial is blood elf's silence, but you need to be melee range and even it isnt super strong since it isnt a true silence, more of an interrupt.
---
As alliance on firemaw and having a rough time I still disagree 100%. I don't think pve servers should even exist. Opting out of half the game for a tailored experience sucks. I don't even pvp much, but I still wouldn't be without it even if it's strictly an inconvenience and source of anger and ever growing distaste of the green skins.
---
Free action potion+PvP trinket+being a gnome as cold blood/prep spec with all CD's and stopping every poly you can. 
---
You have about a 60% chance to win if all these conditions are met
---
I don't like the nationalistic aspect of this game, it doesn't bring fun just developing wrong attitudes.
---
yeah ive noticed in the last week whenever i yell for portals in kargath i get invites immediately.  They have 100% moved to addons probably some are full on bots.
---
20 warriors, half the raid
---
Instead of just insulting BFA for easy upvotes I will remind you that generating gold in BFA is much harder in BFA and thier are plenty of gold sinks ,I sunk my gold into tokens
---
Are there loggin wait times for that server?
---
What makes it particularly funny? Seems like you're just thinking "haha how random that I got an ad for this! haha isn't it funny guys?!" But I don't see what separates it from other ads to make this one funnier than the others.
---
Do people really have to explain to you that if you want new content, Classic isn't the game for you?
---
Nah, you can heal just fine in 52+ dungeons, *with the right gear*. The truth is most talents in deep resto aren’t huge difference-makers, and even mana tide is great but isn’t necessary as long as you have a full set of gear with plenty of int while leveling, and then spend the time to get your healing bis at 60. 
---
I also went enhance until 52 and then went deep resto, but now that I’m well-geared and have been raiding for a while, I’ve found 30/0/21 to be my favorite spec for my play-style.
---
I'm not 60. Constantly get ganked. But I just play smarter. Grind in out of the way spots. Go do a dungeon. Group up with people. Counter gank by asking guildies. Stop bitching, and be proactive. It's a MMO and not a single player game.
---
The MMO you played was different from the MMO I played. Vanilla WoW. The situation with classic right now? Never occurred in Vanilla. The reason being that there weren't even as many level 60's in all of Vanilla as there are currently on my server alone. The game didn't change, how it's played has, and Blizzard didn't adapt to it. Not cut out for pvp? I am playing what I think is an OP pvp class. As a pally at 52 I've solo'd 60 rogues and hunters and warriors that have tried ganking me. The skill cap in Vanilla and Classic WoW is VERY low. Saying someone isn't cut out for it...is interesting. An average mythic raider in BfA has had to use more skill in the first few fights of Uldir alone than an MC raider has to use throughout the entire raid. And that's without even digging into the way PVP has evolved.
---
Wait. Wut
---
Your winning keep going, I swear I care.
---
I'm the type of person who doesn't wanna spend hours in dungeons for my compensation. I'm the type of person who understands the basics of the economy, which is high demand/low supply = money. Which holds true for professions and items as well. A dps or heals blacklisting me is just a hilarious concept because they are much more likely to be removed from a group than I if a dispute were to occur. And finding a group as a tank is instantaneously. I have had people kicked from my groups before for stating my terms and politely pointing out I can leave the group if all members don't agree. Seems most others would rather find a new dps fast than get a good tank
---
It's called details with tiny threat addon
---
this is your local undead rogue who spams “go to retail” every time he kills a lvl 51
---
You ever get the big brain idea to go to burning steppes?  It's way less camped lol
---
/wave /beg and /hug are all emotes you can understand even cross faction, and they were no doubt hanging out there to summon people. Maybe they were level ~30 instead if that's when summons are available, but they are a multiboxer with numerous warlocks who offer summon services to the Horde.
---
Nothing impossible about this.
---
uuh, that's complete garbage. Repentance lasts 6 secs, and breaks on damage, making it the perfect deathray channel opportunity since you can't do anything else without breaking it. You do realise that at his level, deathray is usually \~40% of HP right?

It's both, as I've said in my post, people are better and there's literally 3x the amount of players crammed into the same zones.

Because you need one account per location?
---
Oh 100 percent, but when I have a half hour to squeeze in some game time...it's spent body running in Felwood xD. I could definitely go grind dungeons, I could for sure go join an active guild. The problem is no matter how you look at it....questing is not an option. THAT is the problem.

You’re kidding me. This is where I’ve been making my Mooncloth as well.

I swear I googled “closest moonwells” and not one of the links said their was one in bloody Stormwind!!

I think you need to be able to drop combat to do it, but I’m no expert.
---
Honestly, your comment doesn’t really make any sense or have any cleverness about it. It would make more sense for you to say “ because we have to deal with shit writing/ Alliance shits” but instead you go with something that goes against the function of the toilet, which is to take in the shit.
---
Mageblade goes prio lock because mages get prio mana igniting cord.  Dominance should just flip to whoever doesn't have one.

Get wrecked alliance scum
---
Yep.  The alliance created this problem.  It was a 60/40 server (WHICH IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOU CAN HOPE FOR).  And then like 10 big alliance guilds left asap.  Not sure if it was because they knew they wouldn't be competitive server wise with Onslaught or because they got pounded leveling up, but they ditched as fast as they could.
---
Doesn't matter in the US if I remember right because you signed away your rights. Stop playing blizzard games if you care. EU has some better protections where I think it's been brought up there before legally. Your privacy is the cost of blizzard finally shutting down bots.

One per zone, 70 minute respawn timer
---
100% ally scum made this
---
I'm happy to do it because orbs are still 40-45g on our server. If I score a reserved orb + win a roll, that's a hell of a profitable run and I'll put up with the shit you describe for that. 
---
Though I don't really have nightmare runs anyway. I'm on Westfall-PvE, maybe the big PvP servers just attract a lot of shitters. I don't usually have complaints about my pugs
---
All thats left is dungeon grinding, especially for those between 50 and 60
---
They can get the HOTs from whatever druid has the highest +healing, but beyond that, you'd basically never use them and just use HT. Exact same situation with priests.
---
Lmao get a load of this guy
---
Relatable unfortunately :(
---
faerie fire is the big spell you're missing here.
---
Fucking alliance boomed us
---
Right? World PvP in TBC was just a cat and mouse game where each person could opt in and out at will because of mounts.
---
Reminds me of Diablo II art. I dig it.
---
Wait how is it impossible?
---
Alliance on Whitemane was a little strenuous at first but now it's alright. Last night Horde and Alliance would swing control over certain zones. Also world bosses are now at 1 of each per faction.
---
Overall, i'm enjoying Whitemane.
---
Druid healing in raid basically doesn't use HOTs except keeping them rolling on the MT.
---
There is a multiboxer on Grobbulus Horde who has a bunch of warlocks in inconvenient travel destinations who will sell summons. I spotted one on the island with Duke Hydraxxis (where bads like me swim to on Raid Nights to pick up the [Aqual Quintessence] we need for dousing MC. I am Alliance, and they did not want me to kill their warlock, so they emoted for Mercy, meanwhile I figured out what they were up to and didn't wanna ruin the fun so I /danced at them while I waited for my raid to summon me to the elf room in BRM so I could hop out the window to MC proper.
---
Spamming regrowth is probably the top HPS in the game right now.  You just need to use mana pots and dark runes.
---
Also you want constant rolling hots on tanks unless you are speed clearing and hitting the buff cap.
---
Horde on heartseeker here. We can definitely use more Horde. Alliance have taken to camping the major city flight masters because theres not enough of us out in the world. If your end goal is having tons of alliance to kill then this is the right spot for you.
---
Sure but ive also seen 4 drop in 40 min, which is a huge profit lead over the other guys roll battling for vendor blues. Thorium is 8g a stack on my server which isnt bad. To each their own but its a risk/reward situation. What do you do when 3 of you have mining? Its really common now that everyone understands how busted engi is
---
Sounds like their pretty dumb considering FH spam is probably the most mana inefficient way to heal in general.
---
Fury/Arms feel pretty consistent in their BiS gear, with weapons depending on race mostly. Prot on the other hand depends on deep prot, fury/prot, arms/prot and if gearing for threat or damage reduction. So for tank specs it can vary on going 100% for defense+stamina, going heavy defense+stamina+hit cap and just going purely for the best plate dps gear.
---
Here are maps of the possible spawn points of Black Lotus from Wowhead. But given the 1 hour respawn time and the high demand, the spawn points are usually contested.

Yeah plenty of games being released recently that I'm going to give a shot while I wait for the PVP disaster to die down on Classic. Just a shame, players that are a lot less dedicated to Classic will probably never log back on. That's my biggest concern.
---
Nice. Sounds perfect. Thanks for the reply!
---
That's amazeballs fam. Gorgeous work.
---
Um... yeah? Well, Alliance symbol looks... like a lion!
---
There, I told em!
---
but muh parses
---
and what we have learned so far is that private servers clearly had it wrong as warlocks are out-performing mages hand over foot compared to private server mc data.
---
Thats a nice cover.
---
Because: human male laugh. Sickening.
---
Spamming regrowth is probably the top HPS in the game right now.  
---
But in any case you would much rather have another pally shaman or priest instead of a 3rd resto Druid.  All of them do better than a Druid spamming healing touch.
---
You clearly aren’t a tank.
---
Then you'd have no range and Rag would stomp your shit in.

No they're arent but we fight horde alotttttttt lol
---
Now THIS is propaganda.
---
Unfortunately true. And I couldn't think of anything I would hate to do more than to spend my 50 to 60 classic experience stuck in BRD. A lot of people did that, I know...but I want to quest in EPL and WPL and farm in Silithus and finish Un'goro and get a Winterspring mount and experience that questing/leveling portion of the game. Shame that I can't until this all dies down.
---
&gt; The T1 5 piece set bonus is for things you "don't do" as a raid shaman.
---
&gt; In raid scenarios even R1 chain heal feels dangerously slow for the mana efficiency it brings.
---
The only fight currently in game with any significant multi-target healing demands is Kazzak. On every other boss fight, it's almost entirely single target or avoidable damage - and most of the non-tank damage is slow, giving you plenty of time for response. Moreover, much of the incidental multi-target damage taken isn't healable with Chain Heal due to range issues.
---
In fights with multiple tanks (Lucifron, Gehennas, Garr, Golemagg, Sulfuron, Majordomo), you'd almost always have Resto Shaman primarily focused on a tank. In at least two fights (Geddon, Shazzrah), the Priests are generally busy with dispels and have minimal time to deal with the tank damage. On Ragnaros, Chain Heal's range limitations make it problematic - the damage is all on scattered players rather than concentrated groups.
---
Likewise, your 'dangerously slow' is odd. Due to issues related to buff demands, guild formation and class balance, most guilds bring far more healers than they need. Couple that with the fact that non-tank damage tends to be exceedingly slow in MC (the chance of getting hit twice with unavoidable AE is negligible except for Shazzrah and Ragnaros) and you've got all the time in the world to heal efficiently.
---
&gt; As a raid healer you're not really healing the same target.
---
Not the case with decent healing coordination. Even if you're just mindlessly spamming Chain Heal, you still don't want others sniping your primary heal on the initial target.
---
A fairly conventional 'basic coordination' would be that Shaman always heal the group above with Chain Heal and heal their own group with heavily downranked Healing Waves.
---
I get the impression you're bringing prejudices based in Retail into Classic - when the game is far different. Chain Heal doesn't really start to shine until AQ40 when you've got the sets to augment it. However, this is also the point where you're reducing the number of Priests you bring because Dispel Magic stops being relevant.
---
&gt; You could argue this is beneficial for tank healing, but shamans just don't suit the role of tank spammers compared to priests.
---
Shamans are far better than Priests at tank spamming. While Shaman can downrank to HW3 very effectively, Priests can't downrank into Lesser Heal because Divine Fury doesn't affect it. Priests also don't have the equivalent of Healing Way, which makes Shaman scale much better on single target heals. Lastly, Priests are more Spirit-focused, which makes it far more efficient for them to cast-cancel high rank heals than spam low rank ones.
---
When you have Priests and Shaman both assigned to the same tank, normally you want the Shaman to be pounding away with HW3 (or similar) while the Priests cast-cancel high rank Greater Heal (often casting Renew immediately after a Greater Heal completes).
---
The only time Priests should be doing serious downranking in raids is either Prayer of Healing or when they're spot healing (which they're atrocious at and shouldn't normally have to do).
---
&gt; They have much better raid healing ability, and less mana efficiency for keeping a tank alive.
---
Yes and no. Shaman are better at *spot* healing raids. But Prayer of Healing is an ability so potent that it actually forces your raid structure. In contrast, Resto Shaman are just flat-out better at healing tanks. They proc the armor buff more often, they give a smoother healing experience, they have higher raw throughput and they're more efficient.
---
Lastly, you're not taking into account the sheer volume of stats on Earthfury compared to the normal alternatives. +healing is inarguably better than intellect or stamina. But that doesn't make intellect or stamina worthless - it just makes them less efficient. Your Earthfury piece will normally have a 30% itemization budget than the 'pre-raid BiS' it replaces.
---
That being said, the last 3 pieces of Earthfury normally come at a significant cost so you don't want to equip them unless you know that Healing Wave will be central to your task. On the other hand, it usually should be.
---
I was considering a prot pally for flag carrier at 39. I figured they're basically the hardest thing to kill and blessing of freedom is a thing.
---
Fair enough
---
Exactly why Alliance is the superior faction. :D
---
Your post reads like a fucking WatchMojo intro
---
Yeah but we're playing a game where we can pan the camera. Hills make no difference tbh, nobody is playing in 1st person.
---
Geared hunters parse better than mages too. Mages are probably being taken just because they can decurse.
---
With teeth.
---
Erm, you have to go the actual BG entrance to queue for BG's in classic, do you not?
---
The way I was pulling mobs behind hills should have been discrete enough for the normal person.
---
It is a level 60 rogue, they are going to have Spy installed for sure. Don't try to play ignorant on something so obvious.
---
"I just want a class that lets me do pretty much everything classic has to offer"
---
is what he specified.
---
It's also a good way to go OOM in about 30 seconds.
---
Except Zeppelin's and the tram.
---
There we get infinitely spawning goblins throwing nets and a diseased picking through garbage respectively.
---
Are there no free transfers available on your servers? I moved to a less populated server and life was MUCH nicer, so it's worth a try if the option is available to you.
---
The hills are tall enough if you want to go check them out for yourself.
---
because faerie fire doesn't exist and is terrible, right?
---
I never said Classic wasn't flawed.
---
It's significantly less flawed than private servers. Pservers did NOT "do it better".
---
&gt;if you want to just have a one-sided “private server bad and illegal reeee” take then i’m not interested.
---
Oh, so anyone who disagrees with you is "reeeeeeee" ? Then yeah, looks like we have nothing left to discuss, your mind is already set in stone :)
---
Your coworkers should have rolled on a PvE server, tbh. I’d never suggest new players start with a PvP server.
---
Not with dark runes / mana pots.
---
Most fights don’t last more than 1-2mins.
---
Yeah tbh I'm alright with it. The only people who seem to be upset are the ones in denial about the issues on the Horizon and didn't prepare.
---
Twice
---
You can have both on a PVE server
---
thanks for the reply!
---
The blood will run
---
It’s always usually a hour give or take in each zone
---
Also true. I never suggested to them to play a PvP server. I didn't even know they played. They went in blind, had no idea what they were signing up for. How would they have known?
---
This needs to be a handy note plugin
---
Yeah that is why I have it mainly. So when a real Tank doesn’t materialize I can pinch hit, but I do want to do more PVP and I was thinking a mix of protection with blessing of Kings/Reckoning and ret with seal of command, Conviction, and Eye for an Eye would be good. But that doesn’t give me enough points to keep consecration. And I really don’t have the gold to continually respec you know haha.
---
Umm, that would have been a fantastic solution? If the balance is worse than 55/45, stop allowing players without at least a lvl 20 character on the server from creating more characters of the dominant faction. And the queue should have been faction specific to improve the balance even more.
---
60/40 is a huge disadvantage in the open world - I'm Alliance on such a realm and about 40% of my random PvP encounters end up in 1v2+ just because there are way more Horde out and about. The opposite very rarely happens. IF is constantly besieged, as are the boats and Menethil Harbour, yet I never hear anyone recruit people to go camp zeppelins, and enemy cities have barely been raided since server start. Entering BRM used to mean being prepared to die 3-5 times. Now that TP flight point is constantly camped and the gank groups start outside of BRM, that number can easily be as high as 10 times.
---
PVE, if there is no warrior to sunder a boss, and there is a lot of other phys DPS to take advantage
---
My bad, guys, I misread the room.  I forgot that all the hordies are off actually playing the game!
---
All the top ranged DPS parses on Rag and Ony are mages.
---
They’re literally the same picture
---
You’ve already answered this in your post. Folks trying to level in the open world on PvP servers should just chill for a few weeks until BGs come out. That or level an alt in uncontested territory.
---
Right where it belongs
---
The winterspring mount is doable still, but you gotta stick to the furthest edges of map. But yeah one friend is in the same he'll, but hes a rogue so hes taking his chances while questing, seems to be going decently since he can run and hide
---
If new content is  being developed(Classic+), it would need to start now.
---
FTH
---
You sound like a Bugs player
---
Wonder what amazing shit we're missing from the future :(
---
What does that come out as?
---
It's a 35% mana return 25% of the time. So it's an 8.75% mana savings that is additive (which is actually better than multiplicative in this case) with other Tidal Focus.
---
I feel your pain, having the same problems. I knew what I signed to when I decided on a PvP server to a degree. I didn't put any thought into how it would all change if the honor system was released with no BG's.
---
Like others I've accepted that this just the way it is and have started leveling alts on a PvE server until things blow over a bit.
---
As a mage,  I never charge. I only ask for a tip. For characters less than 50, I do free portals because it helps them level. Above that, I only like tips even for portals. When they ask what is normal,  I tell them mat price. 
---
I also tell them there's no requirement to tip either. 
---
It's just Mana, so I think it's weird to charge for it.
---
Now this is a *shitpost*
---
Levelling is faster and easier in classic? Hoo-boy.
---
There is a lot of people who have really "weird" ideas about PvP. Hundreds of times on the forums I've seen people claiming they are "totally fine with PvP" except "this very specific thing that is happening on their server", yet actually they AREN'T fine if:
---
1) Opponent has numbers advantage.
---
2) Opponent has level advantage.
---
3) Opponent starts a fight when you have low hp.
---
4) Opponent attacks when you fight a mob.
---
5) Opponent attacks when you have no mana.
---
6) Same opponent kills you again after you died to him and rezzed.
---
7) Opponent or group of opponents keep preventing you killing quest mobs/looting quest items they themselves are trying to kill/loot. 
---
And basically anything that isn't a straight 1vs1 honorable duel where both sides announce themselves to each other, and if one side doesn't want to fight the other side should obviously apologise and leave. 
---
Or, in other words, PvP is only fine if you wanted it to happen, if it happened despite you not wanting it or in a way you didn't want it to happen then its bad and Blizzard should do something to fix it. 
---
That's how I understand "people who aren't cut out for it". Maybe you aren't one of them, but trust me, they exist.
---

---
You think you do but you don't. Reroll PvE or play retail.
---
I don't believe so. Like Asmongold could do a Copyright Strike if he wanted to and have the videos taken down. I'm not too sure of the legality beyond that. A ton of people are doing this same thing. I think it's along the same lines as someone starting a YouTube channel talking about Sports/TV Shows and showing replays. The original content creator can have it removed but I do not believe they can outright sue. (I could be wrong though).
---
Oh but I am resilient enough. I don't plan on quitting any time soon. People who think I'm quitting because a game is hard or someone else is ruining my enjoyment based on this post are dead wrong. I enjoy a challenge...and in 2 weeks when I can catch up to 60 safely I will join said BG's and compete with the best of them. I've spent 4 days body walking in Felwood. I don't think it has anything to do with me.
---
A newer player, in all honesty, has already given up. And a lot are going to continue giving up. Nowhere have I said that I want the rules to change because I am losing. I want the rules to change because releasing honor and BG's at the same time would have avoided a situation that is cutting our already dwindling player base down even further, while maintaining the integrity of the game.
---
Meh. Recruit the player not the class.
---
I’ll take a considerate, skilled boomkin over a shitty mage who doesn’t know the fights, how to position properly, or when to stop DPS.
---
That's normal. Somewhere around 48-49 is supposed to be half way to 60 in terms of time played
---
DPS and healers don’t understand how annoying tanking is
---
Ah okay yeah. I knew it was something simple. So this raid tab only shows up when your in a raid?  Or have I just been missing this the whole time lol
---
Thanks for responding.
---
One of my old friends needed one more for a m+ and whispered me. Though I hadn’t been on retail for a few weeks I got on and had to buy invis pots, cheapest stack was like 2000g and I just kinda squinted at it for a moment 
---
I did buy them, 2k retail gold is pocket change but for that one moment I was like “wait hol up”
---
$150 shipped I have 5 available PM if interested
---
They can whisper you but you can’t whisper back
---
Theres a mage on my server named VendingMachine and he stands outside the TM/SS war yelling "insert coin for food and water"
---
I remember kiting him with CoC
---
Specifically for MC the raids gets the most strong giving mageblade to a mage. Stuff like this matters only when you're trying to cut down the amount of ppl in an MC run so you can get more gear for your guild. We were doing 2 32s but gonna switch to 3 24 mans this week so we can start gearing alts for BGs
---
An interesting way to look at it...but there is a huge spike in XP from questing vs grinding plus a monetary reward. What you are saying, is exactly why I prefer questing. Grinding is just questing without the reward at the end, be it money, a new piece of gear, or a spike in your XP.
---
Maybe but there is not too much room for kiting unless you clear the room first. What I did just required me to zone into the cave entrance and kill him.
---
I don't think any of our 7 mages out-dps my lock on any non-AOE MC fights.
---
Both Priest &amp; Shamans will dispell spam the FC if around, keep that in mind.
---
Mods, get this shit out of the sub please
---
That's a good question, I see there is the battle Masters in all the major cities and you used to have to que at the dungeon, but also cross realm wasn't a thing when they first came out either so I guess we'll see what blizz does.
---
Can’t find the video. Any chance you have a link?
---
Another comment from someone missing the point of the post, yikes.
---
Simply put your guildies are being greedy, maybe an asshole. This isn't work and you should feel no obligation to run non-raiders though a dungeon. As an officer I would say your priority is raiders first and everyone else is potential clutter.
---
As a rogue raider myself, I was plenty capable of getting raiding gear without ever asking a single guild member for free handouts or their time.
---
https://youtu.be/8OxMbupKW4w
---
You know i don't know if tab exists or is just blank when you're not in a raid.
---
i'll take that trash off your hands if you throw in $20
---
I can only hope to top this [historical monument](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d60dz0/if_it_criticizes_the_horde_its_low_effort/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Sure but mages have elemental precision which matters with the lack of hit gear. Shadow bolt is longer base cast time so each shadow bolt gets more benefit from SP but that's not relevant, mages still get 80% sp scaling on frostbolt on a 2 second cast instead of 3.5 (iirc, I don't play lock)
---
From what I'm gathering of the Alliance on Stalagg/Skeram experience:
---
1. Fly to Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes for a BRD group
---
2. Have your party die 15 times on the way to the instance because not everyone has stealth and the Horde is literally everywhere
---
3. Eventually get to BRD and finish one run of whatever bosses you were doing
---
4. Decide to reset so you walk outside the instance
---
5. Everyone instanntly dies to the Horde camping outside the instance for people just like you
---
6. Run back from the graveyard and do another run
---
7. People say that this was their last run because they didn't expect to spend so much time doing BRD today
---
8. Everyone hearths out to Ironforge, the mage decides to teleport to Ironforge instead
---
9. Everyone who hearthed dies to the Horde that are camping the Ironforge inns
---
10. The mage who teleported out dies to the Horde rogues that are camping the Ironforge teleport location
---
Just roll a warlock and you will never look back
---
.. maybe because everyone knows exactly what's coming, because, you know, it's already come out?
---
Mage definitely
---
I realise you’re not on EU servers, but if any EU people are looking for the same, Firemaw is pretty balanced (45/55 or so)
---
I like being broke.
---
Always harder from the dominate position.
---
I wish Alliance could transfer off Herod atm,  it’s either try and dungeon level from 48-60 or re roll on a pve server.  I don’t want to throw away all my progress but I’m not even logging in atm because of the severe imbalance. Alliance transferring off only makes it worse I know, but Horde aren’t gonna leave when they control everything   BRM -Menethil- EPL/WPL etc. it’s too good for them right now
---
This. What is there really to showcase?
---
As a guild we understand that we're gonna be in MC a long time... The faster we get our clear more efficient the faster we can do efficient clears with less people= more loot overall in the same amount of time
---
I'm horde and I've done it
---
BRD drops a ton of pre-raid BiS gear. The Grim Guzzeler alone breaks a significant number of groups. The Love Potion makes it a breeze.
---
First time player here, was looking for gold making opportunities when a video sent me to SFK. I got the reaver on my first run and the assassins blade on my 3rd. So now I’m thinking that this place is just loaded! 
---
On about my 20th run now and I am starting to realize I just got super lucky lol
---
My first thought was Silver, with the static painted backgrounds and 3d characters... I swear there was a scene that looked just like this, but I can't find a screenshot of it. [This one is pretty close though.](https://www.pcinvasion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/silver-blade.png)
---
Looking at OP's post history you can totally tell this is 100% legit!
---
Zekhan... Where is our home?
---
I like the metaphor :D
---
It’s not
---
Because mage is a very overrepresented class, with a lot of people coming to it as an AOE grinding/money making FOTM, diluting the pool of actually good players? And averaging out parses for MC/Ony doesn't show issues like hunter's poor scaling. I don't get why "even the very best and most geared hunters are out DPSed by the best mages" is difficult for you to understand.
---
At no point does that phrase trigger me more than when a lvl 60 Tauren spams it after killing me in Redridge when I'm lvl 27.
---
cringe
---
You sell out...
---
ok horde
---
You expect servers to magically balance out at 1:1 with horde racials. Yikes. The problems which exist in vanilla will remain but will be considered in the new expansions blizzard releases. You've completely missed the point that it's more profitable for players to play retail instead of classic. Accept the poor state classic is in or reroll.
---
Please no tbc, I've played private servers for years and it's horde dominant always, with millions of blood elves
---
I hope Wow Classic (or something equally as awesome) is still around in 10 years when I can retire.  I daydream about being able to play all day while no one else is at home.
---
Very good for  my drain tank as well !
---
I seriously doubt someone is making 28k a month off of asmongold clips. YouTube stays pretty quiet about what they pay out to top producers and the payout is super variable based on whether or not your crowd is the type to use adblock. Plus they've been massively scaling down their monetization to smaller channels
---
This lol
---
What's an alternative weapon enchant for a mage than +30 SP or +22int? As both of those are super expensive. Just got rod of the ogre magi and want to get it enchanted.
---
Thanks.
---
ye but dead people from way back got to play irl warriors
---
This is false.
---
Also, fight a decent balance Druid 1v1. You will lose.
---
Yeah the deaths are really frustrating.
---
I spent ages researching to learn the safe spots where you can drop aggro without vanish, and got into the habit of saving sprint for those and only vanishing when the run depended on it.
---
That compounded with soloing the Pyro and Guzzler bosses nets some nice cash!
---
It would’ve been a few weeks of a few hours per night easily. I just committed to re-watching The Arrow and making enough money for epic mounts on him and my alt :)
---
Keep thinking :( stay strong
---
I recently leveled my warrior to 32 and just got ww axe. I find that dw is a lot better for mobs lowers level than you or casters, while ww axe is better for same level or higher mobs and high armor mobs. One thing I never knew, because I only played caster, was that every single mob is either a mage paladin or warrior mob and the armor values for each is different. When I see a warrior mob the ww axe is always on.
---
Holy shit there are still queues?
---
You really deserve every view &amp; follow!

This picture is banned in orgrimmar

Tag me in the reply please :)

Angry upvote cuz I have no frienda
---
Back then people scoffed at using potions in raid. Now, we bring a minimum of one GFPP and everyone has some type of consumable on them at all times.
---
Does this explain why the Horde is so loud and noisy?
---
guess i got spotted :D
---
&gt;Haven't experienced any MMO with a better world PvP zone
---
I played Archeage - a game where you could get ganked and have your trade packs stolen by other players. Even members of your own faction could attack you in open waters. 
---
I played DAOC and Warhammer Online.
---
I LOVE world PvP games. 
---
This isn't world PvP. This is honor farming for gear. As soon as there are rewards for PvP, the community abandons fair fights and looks for ways to farm kills / honor. The PvP community of today wants gear, they don't want the challenge of a fair fight because they might lose and gain less honor / hour.
---
I'm having the same issue lately. Seems to be happening at random but it will happen when I'm in MC, tanking! Lol. I think it's just a bug in one of the addons we have.
---
Link the button to your mouse wheel then set up an RC car's wheel to spin the mouse wheel why you step away.
---
Oof
---
Get a better dot timer
---
Toilet humor
---
I recently just switched to Resto from Enhance because there's pretty much no enhance gear found in raids. Unfortunately I now find myself getting bored when running dungeons, but my guild needs me as Resto. If there's one thing I hope classic brings from retail, its dual specs.
---
Also when I was using the term "you" I was referring to most people with a similar opinion.  Maybe you are but from what I've been reading in Reddit ALOT of people are not cut for world PVP. Not because they lack the skills but because they lack the resilience.  And we can only blame the modern game culture for that.  Easy to reach reward with no punishment for being bad.
---
World PVP might remain the same when BGs comes out because we don't know if playing a BG will actually grant more honor than the Deathsquad tactic.  It's never been tested before so it might be the best way to get Rank 14. So watch out
---
I'm the kind of guy who like to play punishing game that push me to go  above and beyond.
---
1. Darkest dungeon (hardcore turned base RPG with permanent death mechanic)
---
2. Tibia (Oldest active MMO with high punishment for death) (Game was made less punishing over the last few years)
---
3. Dark Souls (Obviously)
---
4. Don't  Starve
---
5. Grimdawn on hardcore
---
People who level slow had all the available information handed to them before launch. If you weren't lvl 60 by the time phase 2 arrived you were gonna get shit on. Everyone knew this, so I can't really feel bad for people.
---
well i have my BIS as well this was a side project to complete while carrying other guild members through instances. Plus i want to do a full 40 man Tier 0/D1 Clear one of these days
---
Shaman. Both shamans and paladins were pink in classic since they were unique to the factions. Then in TBC they changed shamans into blue as both factions could have paladins and shamans.
---
If u play classic, great chance to be a boomer. I'm one :/
---
couldn't tell you since i never wear it outside of a city :D
---
It’s satire. OP picked the most ridiculous alternative to WoW and pretended he was leaving WoW for it.
---
What ticks me off are idiots who don't know about hk diminishing return. Also people who are getting discourage from leveling are feeling powerless from getting gank from group of 60s.
---
Did this, this morning. Finished all of WPL and EPL got ganked 3 times!
---
This takes me back
---
Ashara
---
&gt; tanks never have to whine about people cuz there are no shortage of them
---
And yet here you are, whining.
---
&gt;there are no shortage of them
---
There is certainly less of them when you restrict yourself to only those who have no self-respect and allow themselves to be taken advantage of. 
---
&gt;hence you have no value
---
Explain to me how an all tank dungeon would go? DPS play a critical role, just as tanks do.
---
&gt;there are a billion of you who will cater to every demand a tank has.
---
Pretty sad way to look at things man. I can assure you that a lot of self-respecting dps and healers will not "cater to every demand a tank has" and that there are in fact many reasonable tanks who don't make such demands - you are just one of the shitty ones.
---
Given up playing on Mograine (EU) as alliance. Merged with another guild to be able to raid again. This weekend less than 5 were online friday and saturday and only in Ironforge. Game is dead atm for alot of alliance. Cannot farm anything. Cannot level alts. Cannot even dungeon/raid without dieing 10-15 times trying to get to the instance. And in main hours to add insult to injury there is still a queue of up to 2 hours.
---
I´m probably rerolling PvE when I get the interest again, if I ever do. The current meta of classic has nothing to do with original wow.
---
I was looking so much forward to classic. Perhaps we really didnt want it.
---
Oh damn. That's absolutely hilarious then.
---
I'm also 5/8 Tier 1 &amp; 2/8 Tier 2 lol i was just posting for  Nostalgia
---
📷
---
Playing hotw is best for tanking and healing mixed. You only need 2 sets.
---
In raids the heal is not perfect but i am in the middle of top and low healer. 
---
For tanking you could also offtank in raids.
---
Did both in mc with this build.
---
For pvp setup should be t1/t2 set and high armor/hp/stats item. Especially with ns makros you survive everyfight with your 3min instaheal.
---
lol when did I start whining? been stating facts
---
But of an “off the chest” post, but I’m kinda jealous how mages can make money from both food/water and portals semi regularly. Maybe I’m biased because I’m a warlock myself but I can’t help feeling that, given how great our summoning ability is, we kind of got the short end of the stick class design wise in that we never really get to charge for our services. summons, healthstones, and even soul stone are incredibly powerful abilities, but because of the way soul shards work in classic we have a harder time offering these services to people. I really do like classic much more than later expansions, but I do wish blizzard has given locks some ability to conjure a shard out of combat here and there. I can’t summon myself so my summon ability makes me feel like I’m a wingman to other players.
---
Do not fucking pick Druid you will not have a good time. Hunter or warlock will be great for all content. Both classes are solo Kings, great at leveling and great in pvp
---
The capitalization is meant to represent the undulating tone of sarcasm.
---
Personally I don't see it going anywhere. It's an evolution of text based communication.
---
Hmmm, gonna need a video
---
If you're moonglow and have so much +healing that you're spamming rank3 healing touch then you don't need mp5 do you. Mp5 is important for swiftmend builds though or druids who actually use HoT since it's so mana inefficient.
---
Intelligence and spirit are never better than +healing and they never have been. It's always been crit &gt; mp5 &gt; healing. The primary goal of any healing druid is to get enough +healing to make rank 4 HT viable as a spammable and powerful heal.
---
Omg please cry more
---
Lol considering the gnome also started it. agree, shame

Idk why you think those are mutually exclusive? If you have something that takes 10 hours to do but gets you 1000 gold at the very end and 0 gold up until that point  you would say it was 100 gold per hour (1000 gold/10 hours).  Saying that the average over a longer period of time tends towards 100g/hr is obviously reasonable

there really isn't unfortunately, maybe +9 int if that's within your budget
---
Why is everyone such a carebear. Get good
---
Depends a lot on your class. Some specs have very noticable powerspikes even at the later levels - Warlock drain-tanking for instance became essentially unstoppable at 48.
---
So, it varies a lot from spec to spec.
---
So this can be one of two things:
---
1) a starter edition account; if that’s the case, the starter edition shares the same subscription that it would for retail, so it would not be exclusive to classic.
---
Or 
---
2) it could be a recruited account through RaF, which again shares the same subscription as the retail game in turn not allowing it to trade in classic.

Your cringe-meter is weak af bud

Dude that makes me depressed. Wrath was so much fun as a shaman.
---
You can play right this second in any of dozens of servers, figure it out.
---
I’m a 55 orc warrior and Alliance Raid geared 60s wait until I pull mobs to attack me. Yeah the horde are the shit player.
---
Do tell me your secret to slaying 3 level 60 rogues that are ganking you at level 48. Please, give me your wisdom.
---
Yeah why on earth would you play on that server?

Mageblade/staff of dom prio has nothing to do with MIC. It's prio mages because locks have sash of whispered secrets. In terms of guilds with progression in mind, mageblade goes to mages or only the biggest of dick warlocks. I wish it were different as i would love a mageblade, but it's best for the guild.

No one gives a shit about this unless you’re a min/max elitist nerd.

True
---
This UI looks almost exactly like mine and it is freaking me out
---
This has been classic since private servers have been a thing.
---
Holy shit, this is bad. I play on stonespine EU and its pretty balanced I feel, but I could be wrong
---
I change my talents to 33 points and discipline. This way I can get the mana bonus as well as the plus 5% to spell damage. 4 points in making instant spells cost less as well as power infusion. Put on all spell damage gear that I have (which isn't that great) and I come out with a little bit over 5K mana and I have to pop one greater mana potion to be able to finish the packs.
---
Sorta. It depends on user-fed info on "census plus classic" addon, manually check the fix that broke that addon a month or two ago, let the addon fetch data for a few different days and manually download info to the site.
---
It only scans your faction by spamming /who, so if you fetch your data to the site but the other faction doesn't do the same, you get incorrect results.
---
Kromcrush definitely has more than 6k on horde and 3k on alliance. At least twice as much for horde at least. When I bothered with that on horde side, a couple of days at different times found 9k people.
---
They did say they wanted a way to auto upload this info to their site, or do it in-game through a button, so i expect data to be more reliable by then.
---
I recommend buying random green items that give alot of intellect. You don't really need HP that much, 3k will be enough. Pick couple of items from AH (they should be around 50s each) and get over 6k mana
---
I’ve heard 44,45, 46 and now 48-49. Does anyone have a real answer?

Now shut the fuck up

Did you redraw the diamond? Looks like you cut the horde logo out which is more difficult, then got bored and couldn’t be bothered to do the diamond so drew your own.
